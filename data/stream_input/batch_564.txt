B000BB1MIC|5.0|I truly loved the Fifth Season of Gilmore Girls. The writing is amazing for all the characters. The little twists and turns kept my attention. It makes you want to just sit and watch all the episodes in one sitting. The actors are wonderful as in all seasons. It is very difficult not to get hooked on the Gilmore Girls and entire cast.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Green Day sold out with this album, you can't deny that. Was it their fault? Part yes and no. <br />  Wearing eye make up, putting their songs all over mtv and the radio, and even making American Idiot wrist bands is so bad for your self in the long run. <br /> However, Green Day did not choose for so many whinny emo freaks to start listining to this music and call them selfs fans of green day. Green Day was never supposed to be the best rock music, even they knew that. They always where one of the best fun bands ever, that could speak to you and mean something, but their always was someone making better music then them, that was more talented and better song writers. <br /> But still, green day put out some great music, and had in my opinion a one of the best albums of 00', with warning. They came close to putting out the best album of the year, Kid A of coarse was by far the best, and could have headed in a great direction. <br />  Instead, they realise American Idiot, which is a great album, but ruined by everything but the music. Buy this album in 30 years when its not all over the radio and the worst thing to happen to music and american youth ever, MTV.
0689835604|5.0|You never know which ones are going to take.  I bought this one so that when my 18-month old granddaughter comes over to the house she has a new book we can read together. She points to the eyes and the belly button when we open up the pages. She didn't pay any attention to the book on manners (by the same author) which I also bought. I guess she is too young for that. This one is a simple book but she can interact with it and she loves to point to things she knows.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|this was a good album to me if someone else had sung it and wrote it  it  wouldve been maybe a grammy nom but thats not the case here jennifer cannot sing at all  but she can act and dance dont hate cause shes LAtina!
0307276902|1.0|For a man who is supposed to be so educated he didn't realize that a memoir wasn't supposed to be made up of lies. To the people who wasted their money on this book I feel sorry for you. I borrowed it from the library and am glad to not have bought it.  Because of his lies how do we know the rest of the book even happened. I wonder if he was even an addict at all. I watched the Oprah show where people who were addicts were given advice from this guy. He knew from the beginning about the lies but wasn't man enough to step forward and change the items. Not to worry though Karma has a way of fixing things. He will get what he deserves and I hope it slams him hard. To this day the jerk doesn't feel he has done anything wrong that he needs to apologize for.
B000002H97|4.0|Okay, maybe this is because I'm from the 90's, but, this is one of my favorite Albums of all time. I rank it third, behind \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\". I am so sick of people calling this album garbage. Are they actually listening?? Okay, so hearing the same 5 songs over and over can get a little old (Sandman, Sad but True, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters, The God that Failed), but, come on. This album was great. I can't say that there was a song that I didn't like. People say this was the biggest \\"sellout album\\". What about Load? This was true Metallica. The lyrics, while more personal then the others, are still powerful, the guitars still blazing, the drums still echoing. So how did they sell out? Now, I'm not saying that the Black Album was in the same league as Ride the Lightning, because I'm not, but don't crap on this album. So stop the whining already. I like this album, and people who say Metallica sucks, and point to this album, aren't real fans. Load was bad, ReLoad was as well, and Saint Anger could have been better. But, the Black Album is, has been, and always will be, a great album.

B0007OCG56|4.0|Many of the other reviews obsess over some of the film's minor flaws, like the writing out of the Clasky's son and the sotto voce guilt trip that Brooks is playing on American audiences.  Content yourselves with this folks: he could've ruined the race-and-class issues inherent in a film like this, the way \\"Grand Canyon\\" and \\"Crash\\" butchered race issues and \\"Maid in Manhattan\\" butchered class/ethnic issues.<br /><br />That said: great acting, great morality play.<br /><br />Acting. Shelbie Bruce as Cristina Moreno stole the show.  The simultaneous translation provided in the confrontation between Flor Morenoa and John Clasky is a classic.  Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler, and known quantity whether you like him or not.  I like him.  Tea Leoni: loved her every since the short-lived Fox sitcom \\"Flying Blind.\\"  I guess that dates me.  She gives 110% and plays her role at 110%, just below the caricature of an Anglo housewife-overachiever.  Sarah Steele was very good as well.<br /><br />Morality play.  Any film whose moral basis is strength in the face of adversity is OK by me, and very refreshing.  The film makes this point time and time again: the flight to Mexico, Flor's decision to devote time to Cristina, returning money for fear of its corrupting influence, non-consummation of a desired relationship because of marriage commitment.  All these themes are worked in to Spanglish with wit and grace.
B000002H70|5.0|I still remember when I got this cd, which was only about a year and a half ago. I was in Manhattan (I moved back home) for college. I pulled an all nighter and at dawn I took the Staten Island ferry for fun. I saw a bus that went to the mall. I'd never seen it so I was excited to see a mall, something to remind me of home. I got out there and I saw a Circuit City. I went inside and saw this cd. I had heard such great reviews on it so I wanted to get it. I still have the reciept! I thought I would fall asleep on the way home after being up all night, but this cd kept me awake. What a great band. What a great cd. What a beautiful gift The Cure gives to the world. <br /> <br />Long Live The Cure.
B000069HK2|5.0|The funny thing is that i used to really hate music which was yelled into the microphone, i don't know, i guess i just found it annoying...actually, i used to say that it wasn't really music..However, i was introduced to the used and completely changed my point of view! As amazing as it may seem, i started liking screamed music by listening to bert mckracken's excellent lyrics and plain brilliant songs and if anyone likes emocore, hardcore, screamo etc..all those genres then they will definitely like this band!! Because it isn't really that heavy, so it's like the \\"perfect\\" point, some yelling here and there but not all through the song which is a plus because most people get tired halfway through a song which consists of only shouting and making noise...No, The Used is definitely not that..The music this band makes is great, and on this album Blue and Yellow would definitely be my favorite. Though I don't really know how to describe it, beause it's just so unique i don't think i can compare it to anything i've heard before, it's just Blue and Yellow and it rocks! On My Own is probably the \\"soft\\" song on the record though it still catches your attention due to the feeling which it is performed with, specially that part when bert starts singing \\"on my own...\\"and the suddenly breaks into a passionate scream...And well where can I leave the classic, The Taste of Ink?? Anyway, I think if people really want to listen to some of the best emocore around, they should definitely purchase this record...I personally love it!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|If you like the Lord of the Rings movies, you need to buy this cd.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I think the first song I heard by The Strokes is reptilia, and i must say that i automatically fell in love with them! julian casablanca's distinctive voice, a sort of croaky but still excellent voice, certainly appealing to women all around the world (yes he's gorgeous);then of course nick valensi's talent with the guitar! who on earth can play all those solos as well as he can?? This debut album is simply brilliant, starting from my personal favorites \\"hard to explain\\" which is really catchy (but not catchy in the bad way) and \\"is this it\\", the first track on the album which is slow but still really gets to you..i can also mention \\"trying your luck\\" which i simply adore too, \\"take it or leave it\\", \\"new york city cops\\"..i mean, if anyone asks me i would buy this album a thousand times! Still, if you're a more typical hard rock like say Poison, Guns n Roses, or say Sabbath, Megadeth and of the kind this isn't really the album for you. I would define their genre as a modern rock, not very heavy but extremely catchy, with good lyrics and very original sounds, the brilliance of new-wave. Sounds like what? Well, nothing really, they're one of a kind  still not recommended for ones who have a fancy for metal or hardcore, however modern rock say radiohead, razorlight, stereophonics and such then this is the album for YOU.
B00005JKJA|5.0|People either slam this film for its bewildering qualities and its nontraditional narrative, or love it for its hypnotic appeal and strange dark beauty. I like movies that are not like the majority, that don't need to spoon-feed to the audience. \\"Mulholland Drive\\" at any given moment can make me thrilled, amused, mesmerized, sad, or inspired .. such is the power behind this piece of cinematic art.<br /><br />All is not what it seems, of course. But don't spend too much time trying to figure things out. Just enjoy the ride, go with it. There are so many little touches here and there that linger with you, that make this film unique. Silly things, scary things, and also heartbreaking things. No wonder Lynch was nominated for Best Director. And I must give credit to Angelo Badalamenti for another moving and evocative music score. It enhances the visuals perfectly.<br /><br />There's been endless talk and musing over the meaning of this film ... so many reviews delve into what we're SUPPOSED to figure out and understand and interpret. They point out the dreams, the truth, and the duality. That's fine, but let's not get sidetracked so much by seeking the meaning that we forget to enjoy the art of this wonderful film: its sights and sounds and colors, its comedy and darkness and menace, its bizarre characters. \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is something extraordinary.
B00008977N|5.0|I've read reviews stating that this DVD is over-produced, thus less than optimum energy.  However, I love this DVD.  I'm not high tech so I guess I don't search for production flaws.  All I know is that I listen to this at least once every couple days.  My 15 year old daughter is even getting into it.   <br /> <br />I say it is high energy.  I use it as a workout video... although I need to skip a few of the slower songs for that.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend. <br /> <br />

B000AM4PBS|5.0|Friends started off introducing us to six good friends.  Ross Geller, a nerdy paleantoligist, his old college buddy, wise cracking office drone Chandler Bing, Chandler's roommate Joey Tribbiani, an ignorant, oversexed, Italian guy, Ross' sister, obsessive neat freak and extremely competitive Monica Geller, Monica's ex-roommate, free spirited eccentric Phoebe Buffay, and Monica's current roomate, formerly spoiled Rachel Green. <br /> <br />The main plot points around these charachters being Ross and Rachel's off and on romance, Ross getting divorced, Chandler's work and wisecracks, Joey's auditions, money probablems, and sex life, Monica's obsessive compulsive disorder, Monica and Chandler's romance, Phoebe's casual relationships and spirituality, and Rachel attempting to work for her own after being formerly spoiled. <br /> <br />SEASON RATINGS :: <br /> <br />Season One - The funniest season by far.  Not as much plot at the others. : 10/10 <br /> <br />Season Two - The second funniest season, with the edition of Ross and Rachel's relationship adds more plot. : 10/10 <br /> <br />Season Three - Some very funny and some very classic episodes : 9/10 <br /> <br />Season Four - Begginning of Chandler and Monica's relationship, other then that not as good : 8/10 <br /> <br />Season Five - People discovering Monica and Chandler's relationship, The gang going to Las Vegas, great season. : 10/10 <br /> <br />Season Six - Joey's money crisis, Ross and Rachel's annulment, Monical and Chandler moving in together, a jam packed season..maybe too jam packed though : 9/10 <br /> <br />Season Seven - Monica and Chandler's wedding along with other great stuff : 10/10 <br /> <br />Season Eight - The One With the Videotape is the best one here : 8/10 <br /> <br />Season Nine - Good moments, not great - 9/10 <br /> <br />Season Ten - The finale, great classic episodes, great ending, very good season : 10/10 <br /> <br />I found that the early seasons had less of a plot then the later seasons, making it funnier.  But the later seasons were more interesting.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Billy Wilder's Academy Award winning pic stands the test of time.  Touching on contempory and eternal themes of infidelity, climbing the corporate ladder and, of course, sex the director and screenwriter I.A.L.Diamond weave a comic masterpiece, \\"qualitywise\\". Jack Lemon is superb. In lesser hands the portrayal could of become a despicable twerp but thanks to Lemons deft handling,\\"actingwise\\", his C.C. Baxter is sympathetic and lovable. Shirley McLaine is great. Fred mcMurray, this underated actor could play slime (Double Indemnity, The Caine Mutiny), comic eccentrics (Flubber)lovable everymen (My Three Sons), and heroes (The Far Horizon), scores another great credit. A great romantic score. Watch this one each year on New Years Eve!
B000002H97|5.0|After Metallica's sickening loss to Jethro Tull at the Grammys in 1988, Metallica struck back to win in 1989 with 'ONE'. At the award ceremonies, Lars remarked \\"Fortunately for us, Jethro Tull did not put out a record this year\\". Who the hell cares about damn Jethro Tull. Metallica went on to create History a couple of years later, with their Multi-Platinum self titled album, lovingly called the BLACK ALBUM by Metallica fans the world over. <br /> <br />If there has to be an award for Metal Album of all time, its got to go to this one. Hetfield's kickass vocals coupled with Lars rollicking drum work backed by Hammett's mastery, Newstead's consistency and out-of-this-world production values by Bob Rock makes this album a must-have for all rock lovers. <br /> <br />This album is a sell out, even today in Jan'2006 and is hard to find on the shelves after 16 years since it came out. All songs are tremendous hits but Sad But True, Enter Sandman, Of Wolf and Man, Nothing Else Matters, Unforgiven-1 stand out and were big hits. <br /> <br />Gets this album, whether you are a hardcore metallica fan or not, you'll never be disappointed <br /> <br />Reuben Sylvester <br />New Delhi, India
1577311523|5.0|im not going to tell you how magnificent this book is or how helpful it will be to the world if understood. im only going to say if you take advice from the people who couldnt reach inner peace than your subsiding with the people trapped in there mind. you can not simply break away from this train of thought that you have used all your life. it takes time for most. and lots of it. it took me half a year to truely integrate some of the things he says into my life appropriately. and after you experience what inner peace truely is things become increasingly more clear to you. within a year your progress will be great.  <br /> <br />it is very easy to just brush this book off as a joke or a crazy peice of literature. however that is only your mind making judgements as usual. i am only 20 years of age so breaking from my mind might not have been as difficult as it will be for people who have established an identity of many years with there mind.  however i still believe its possible. his writing is clear and concise and states things in a tone that supports his teaching. im not sure if it is even possible for older generations to integrate these things into there life simply because they have lived there life in the mind or they are more likely to be close minded than the children born today but it is still worth a try. i hope that everyone can someday incorprate some of these insights into there life. because once you catch a glimpse things slowly change in your life.  <br /> <br />if youve ever wished you could focus your energy to a higher level than this book will help you understand how. i was once extremely obsessed with images and emotions and had a incredibly poor attention span. since then i have literally cured \\"ADD\\" or however you would like to refer to this lack of focus. studying is incredibly easy for me and every activity in my life has improved including my athletic ability, thinking ability and listening/interpreting skills. dont read this book simply because of those reasons though. read it so you too can hopefully see who truely resides inside you. <br /> <br />if you have any problems with anxiety, fear, lack of focus, depression, or any other problems with your emotions i highly recommend you read this book. i once had all of these problems as well and they have simply vanished from my life within the last year.  <br /> <br />dont look for scientific proof of how this changes you. be the proof.
0307276902|5.0|I know there is so much controversy surrounding this book now about how certain parts were embellished...I for one, still found the book amazing. I starting reading the book before everything with Oprah happened, and even after I heard that certain parts were somewhat fabricated, in the end it still someone who is severely addicted to drugs overcoming that addiction. And anyone who has had to deal with that in their lives knows what that is like to go through.also, maybe certain parts were embellished, all the same-these were the events as James saw them. And maybe, for example, his 30 minutes in jail (or however long) did seem like 87 days to him. Who are we to say it doesn't?? I still stand by this book, and no..Like Oprah, i don't think it's right that he \\"lied\\" if you want to call it that. I don't regret for one second the $22.00 I spent on this book. It reached a part of me on a deeper level than any book ever has. Fiction or non-fiction.
B00005JNEW|3.0|OK, as it stand alone, it's a good film.  However, the book remains one of my favorite books of all time, and my expectations for the film may have been too high.  The acting by all of the characters is good and the story is solid, but I just don't think the screeplay adaptation worked like I hoped it would.  Whereas I found myself unable to put the book down, I wasn't tied to the room when watching the DVD.  Good, but not great.
0307276902|5.0|First of all I would like to say how much I admire Oprah. Her decision to create a book club is a wonderful idea to encourage people to read all kinds of books. <br /> <br />With regards to James Frey's book, I do not feel he is \\"wrong\\" so to speak with his quote on quote memoir.  I have not finished the book, but I started reading it again before all of this speculation developed.   <br /> <br />I,like many people were shocked to hear the fabrication associated with this book. <br /> <br />This is the way I see it.  He was so screwed up beyond what many of us reading it knows.   <br /> <br />So what if some of the characters in the book were altered.  What if this is what he actually thought and felt and remembered upon writing this journal (now into a book) during his state of mind.   <br /> <br />There are people out there like him that are so f----- up and yet he decided to tell his story the way he saw it and/or remembered it.  Drugs can alter many things. <br /> <br />Lastly, and most importantly, why don't we all commend him for overcoming the nearly impossible.  I applaude him.  I give him a standing ovation for beating this and \\"holding on\\" when he thought he never could.  Let this be an example for our youth or anyone that reads this book despite the fabrication. <br />To me it's real, raw and relatible.   <br /> <br />Leave him alone and give him credit where credit is due.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Sure, the debate on what's Punk rages on, but there's no debating that this Green Day-sponsored/endorsed fanclub is the most non-Punk thing ever... Go to [...] Note the 'Annual Fee only $20' in huge lettering that takes up your entire computer screen. Note that one of the so-called \\"perks\\" is that Billie Joe will be \\"answering your questions\\" all this month. Wow. Now laugh (unless you already paid the twenty bucks), because the band used to answer questions for free several years ago on their message board, again, which used to be free. I don't care what you say, this new fan club is the calling card of a sell-out band, period. When you have to PAY to see inarticulate ramblings typed up by Billie Joe. This isn't the same band I used to adore ten years ago.   <br /> <br />You really do belong to an Idiot Club if you're willing to pay any amount of money that merely gives you access to a message board with pictures you can eventually find elsewhere on the 'net and occasional snippets of everyone's favorite stoner Billie Joe. This band is alienating the fans who can't afford the fee; how Punk! <br /> <br />For $20, you should get something really worthwhile instead, like a really good magazine subscription, a nice new shirt, two used CDs at your local used record shop, a Special Edition DVD of your fave movie, or a nice dinner for yourself. There's so much you can do with twenty dollars. Heck, just giving out a $20 bill to a random person on the street would be more productive because at least they won't spend it on a pay-per-view message board like Green Day has. <br />
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|When I first saw this album I immediately bought it; having loved their previous releases \\"Is This It\\" and \\"Room on Fire\\". However, I was very dissapointed with the musical content. While  The Strokes have been known to cunningly integrate an eletronic sound into their music, I felt that the sythesization they used dominated most of the CD. I wouldn't mind this so much, but it took away from the instrumentals which, I felt, were already minimal. The lyrics also bothered me. Songs like \\"Soma\\" and \\"Reptillia\\" use subtle yet brilliant lyrics which make both songs really easy to get into. Most of the songs on \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" however have relatively shallow lyrics, and just about every song is talking about the same thing. Unless you like Emo, the lyrics on this CD get really whiny and obnoxious. In fact, this CD sounds more like a combination of Franz Ferdinand and the Killers, with maybe a little bit of the Kaiser Cheifs thrown in. It's not an awfull album but, if you're looking for the old school stroke sound, you won't find it here. It's sad to know that even The Strokes have given in to the electronic emo mania sweeping the \\"rock\\" music industry. Listen to The Beatles for crying out loud! That's rock and roll!
0977326403|5.0|A welcome addition to the orginal book. This is a quick read which translates the business concepts of \\"Good to Great\\" into context for not for profits. A useful resource for those interested in improving performance in the NFP sector. Also can be used to guide NFP Boards as they look for assistance in formulating their own strategic efforts.
630521610X|5.0|Come December, Scream will be ten years old. That freaks me out. I still remember seeing this when I was a sophomore in high school. How time flies... <br /> <br />Kind of bashed by horror diehards when it was released, it nevertheless became a box office smash. It started a trend of some really crappy teen slasher movies during the latter half of the 90's (we're now in the age of remakes), but this definitely remains the best of the bunch. Very original, with a quick pace and a likable cast. I never understood why so many people thought it was \\"scary\\" back then, but it entertained the hell out of me, and still does to this day. <br /> <br />The DVD is pretty good, with an ample amount of bonus features and crisp 5.1 audio. But, it's non-anamorphic, which could be a pain in the arse for those of you with widescreen televisions. Since it's tenth anniversary is approaching (I still can't believe it), Dimension would do well to release an anamorphic director's cut (which I actually have on VHS... the director's cut, not an anamorphic video). There isn't a huge amount of difference in the DC, but it still retains Craven's original vision, something I think fans of this film who never owned it on VHS would like to see. <br /> <br />Scream seems to have become \\"accepted\\" by the horror community. Not because it magically got any better with age, but because some of those who used to bash it seem to have finally grown up and won't let their taste be dictated by what's popular at the moment (See? It works both ways). I'm rambling. <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0131479415|3.0|A 5 star review just doesn't mean anything anymore. There are some good ideas in this book, but large stretches of this book are just absurd. This thing reads like homework that was finished on the bus (you can almost see the bumps in the road). The structure of the book is completely haphazard. One minute, we are talking about doing estimates. The next minute we are trying to figure out how a project will pay for itself, then, it's on to how to split up stories that got too big. I was waiting for a sidebar with a recipe for a great chiffon cake. At the end of the chapter on estimating value, the author recommends another book and says that's where his content came from (citational plagiarism is called 'plugging,' Youngster). Then, the chapter on splitting stories made me laugh out loud in places. Things like 'split stories along data lines,' or 'split stories along priority lines' or one of the funniest 'split it along CRUD lines.' Come on.<br /><br />The good part of this book is the one chapter on estimation and discussion of things like using Fibonacci for bucketing of estimates into story points, the importance of seeing estimates as relative, and the idea of doing planning poker. In short: again, it's an article that was turned into a book by a set of expansion techniques that are astounding for not being illegal, let alone questionable. And all this inside a fortress of testimonials that makes Fort Knox look lightly defended.
0307276902|5.0|Despite all of the controversy, I just finished his book (audio). I think it is well written, compelling, and wish it could be required reading for every high school student. Yes, it should've been marketed as \\"based on a true story.\\" Yes, RH should've done a better job factchecking, but beyond all of that it is a strong, powerful book about the world of addiction and redemption. I wonder how so many other classic books/authors would have stood up to the same criticism-- James Joyce's Portrait of an Artist, Arthur Miller's work, Hemingway's Moveable Feast and other writings, and so forth. I guess I am a bit dissappointed that RH allowed the author to be bullied by Oprah and the media. I wish RH had admitted wrong and still defended the author and the quality of the book. Despite Oprah's claims, readers were not dissappointed in the book. In the end, I hope the controversy causes more to read the book, which is classic American ironicism, but I think--despite Oprah's contentions--Mr. Frey has written a powerful, thought-provoking, thoroughly modern American classic.
B00081MUY0|5.0|\\"Sunshine Superman\\" remains to this day Donovan's greatest work, a pioneering masterpiece which ranks as one of the best albums of all time.  That the 19-year-old could write and perform a work so ahead of its time--he was working on the same artistic level as The Beatles, who were recording \\"Revolver\\" during the same months--seems astonishing today, but it took forty years for a proper version of the album to be released.   <br /> <br />\\"Sunshine Superman\\" originally appeared in September 1966 in the US only in \\"reprocessed stereo\\", and when it was finally released in the UK in June of '67 (which made it seem less pioneering than it was in those heady times) it was combined with songs from \\"Mellow Yellow\\" in a mono version that sounded OK but in spite of the clear genius of the songwriting and arrangments, the sound on both versions seemed \\"off\\" and the CD versions up to this point did nothing to improve matters.  Finally, forty years later, some wizard at EMI properly remastered the sound and the results are astonishing: the acoustic guitars, sitars, tablas, harpsichords and organs have a deep, rich resonance to them which wraps around the listener's ear like a fine silk tapestry.   <br /> <br />The album contains not a single weak track and although the pace towards the end of the first side slows to a crawl (with three slow tracks in a row), all are gorgeous.  The title track and \\"Season Of The Witch\\" were memorable psychedelic rockers, while stoned ballads like \\"Three Kingfishers\\" and \\"Guinevere\\" are awash in a dreamy, novel synthesis of Indian and Celtic influences that is simply intoxicating. The combination of acoustic and electric guitars, electric violin, harpsichord, strings, sitars and tablas made it one of the first pyschedelic reocords and Donovan has since belatedly been recognized for his contributions to the movement, his influence on The Beatles being particularly strong (see The White Album).   <br /> <br />The next two albums, \\"Mellow Yellow\\" and\\"A Gift From A Flower To A Garden\\" were equally focused and essential but \\"Sunshine Superman\\" remains his greatest, both lyrically and musically, <br />and the measure by which all of his later works were compared. <br />This remastered version also contains the essential outtakes \\"Breezes Of Patchulie\\", \\"Museum\\" and \\"Superlungs\\" which are all in the same breathtaking mold as the album (all three should have been included, actually, and \\"Museum\\" and \\"Superlungs\\" may have balanced the album a bit more with rockers, but both found their way in satisfactory versions on later works), as well as a few acoustic demos never before released. In all, an essential purchase for all Donovan fans, who have been waiting years and years for something like this to come out--and unlike some reviewers here, I thought the liners were fine and quite detailed.
B000AYEI5Y|4.0|It's rare to find good songwriting, singing and musical arrangements in our day and age, especially when it comes to a complete CD full of great songs. James Blunt won't be a one-hit wonder, instead I think he'll be around for a very long time. After listening through this CD you only have one desire: I wanna hear more. The CD has 10 songs and each one is superbly crafted -- almost haunting with chills running down your spine at times. When I heard a few seconds of \\"You're Beautiful\\" on TV I knew I had to get this CD. <br />Most certainly I would have given the CD 5 stars, but the whole package is important to me and the cover art has to be good too ... and that's where the problem is as it communicates some sort of philosophy (which is absolutely unnecessary) and a philosophy I don't agree with. Also the cover reminds us apparently intentionally on Jim Morrison -- and in some of the songs some comparisons are in place. <br />Anyway, one ballad after another, James Blunt does an excellent job. The musical arrangements are done with \\"less is more\\" in mind and these are superbly crafted ... an emphasis on a guitar here, on an organ there and a piano in another song -- excellent arrangements.
B00008IAMD|5.0|If you like Johnny Cash at all, this will be an excellent purchase.  \\"Hurt\\" got a lot of attention, but \\"When the Man Comes Around\\" is arguably the best song on the album.  Some of the covers seem to be odd choices, but they work.  Note that there are two editions of this CD, one with a bonus DVD of the \\"Hurt\\" video and one without.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I'm one of those people that saw this movie decades ago and was ready to see it again since my memory had faded. There are many, many undertones in this movie that represent our world today. Hard to follow at times, humorous at other times, and downright disturbing most of the time.<br /><br />It's the typical storyline. Girl meets boy, have baby, get married. She can't stand the situation and leaves. Baby is left with father. Nothing is normal in this movie, but could be anyone's life. Please read Stanley Allen's review on Amazon. I think he relays much of what it taking place and the symbolism.<br /><br />Here's my perspective of the baby: I felt sorry for this creature of a baby that was brought into this crazy, insane world. There was something lovable, yes lovable about the innocence of this living being. How traumatic to be brought into this cold, dark world and having a mother that can't and won't take care of you. (Would she have aborted the baby if she had the time? He/it was born so quickly.) Neither parent ever showed love for this child. The baby just layed on the hard table top. They never picked up and barely touched the baby. They didn't know how to love this child or anyone else (including the cute little puppies). No wonder this child cried and cried. I think that Henry was confused and upset that he had brought this child into his terrible world. And the thought of creating another baby with the lady across the hall deeply concerned and scared him. But his desires took over. My heart was crushed when Henry &%$#&%# and I saw the miserable death of the baby. Putting this innocent creature out of its misery relieved Henry. It made me wonder about the number of babies born in the world today, many of which would be better off not being brought into this world at all.<br /><br />Halfway through the movie I was not sure whether I could continue watching. \\"When is this going to be over\\" my love and I asked each other, but continued to watch intently. It definitely freaked us out and made us think But, I would much rather watch a movie that is thought provoking. I really appreciated my normal, lovely life after this movie was over. This movie is not for everyone. You'll either like it or hate it....<br /><br />P.S. The radiator girl was creepy as hell and I really couldn't watch that part.t and made us think But, I would much rather watch a movie that is thought provoking.

B000001ESP|5.0|After \\"Permanent Waves\\" from 1980 my expectations were very high for the next Rush album. I'll never forget the first seconds of Tom Sawyer... wow, way above expectations, those drums... Neil - superb. Red Barchetta - classic, YYZ, unbelievable, talk about the technical complexities of \\"Hemispheres\\" - it's all here, and under 5 minutes, stunning. Alex Lifeson (Guitar), Geddy Lee (Bass) and Neil Peart (Drums) really excel here. Limelight followed and I just couldn't believe it - another stunner. What was, in the album days, \\"Side Two\\" followed, with Camera Eye (an 11 minute 2 part classic), the brilliant and heavy riffing \\"Witch Hunt\\" and closes with the uplifting \\"Vital Signs\\".    Only three years years on from the classic \\"Hemispheres\\" and this plus the previous (\\"Permanent Waves\\" from 1980) showed just how far Rush had progressed. Overall the songs were shorter and the lyrics had developed from Science Fiction based to more \\"everyday life\\" (Living in the \\"Limelight\\" a great example of this). The playing continued to get better both technically and also in feel (everything seemed to flow so well together).    In summary a fantastic album, an album so strong that the first three tracks from it would appear for its next Live release together with three from Permanent Waves. Rush had indeed entered a new era and like \\"All the Worlds a stage\\" (Live album from 1976) showed the strengths of the bands first four albums peaking with 2112, the upcoming \\"Exit Stage Left\\" would showcase Rush's tremendous live show in support of it's latest stunning effort.    I hope you enjoy this album as much as I did, it certainly sounds as great today as it did 25 years ago, a fantastic effort from the lads from Canada.
0553801503|1.0|What a disappointment.  When did Martin become pen pals with Jordan??? <br /> <br />I'm hoping that in 2011 (when Martin will get around to releasing the next one!) he'll put a plot outline together so I don't have to remember 25+ characters that will probably die for no reason anyway. <br /> <br />I would not suggest reading this book unless you have trouble sleeping.  It's a much better substitute for Nyquil! <br />
B000001ESN|5.0|This was the first Rush album I ever bought (together with  Hemispheres (from 1978)) after seeing a couple of videos on TV in 1980.    Rush seemed to reach a technical peek with Hemispheres, I remember thinking, \\"how would you top that?\\" and deep down wanted a \\"Hemispheres Part II\\" after I'd finished listening to it and prepared myself to listen to Permanent Waves. Wow what a difference, musically the album is superb, Rush play everything to perfection (as always), lyrically this album is quite a move away from the \\"science Fiction\\" type based lyrics of the 3 albums that preceded it  (\\"2112\\" - `76 / \\"Farewell to Kings\\" - `77 / \\"Hemispheres\\" - `78) to more \\"real life\\" type scenarios.    The album is very diverse, starting with an absolutely fantastic opener - \\"Spirit of Radio\\" complete with a reggae feel in the middle of the song. There is nothing over 10 minutes on the album (the closest at 9 minutes being the stunning 3 part \\"Natural Science\\" the next longest being the majestic / soaring \\"Jacobs Ladder\\" at 7 minutes. A couple of great rockers, \\"Entre Nous\\" and the faster paced \\"Freewill\\" (featuring some great interplay between Geddy Lee (Bass) and Alex Lifeson (Guitar) - which would be a staple of their live shows with of course the ever brilliant Neil Peart on Drums. Adding to the diversity of Permanent Waves was a more acoustic type number - the beautiful \\"Different Strings\\".     In summary this, Rush's 7th, seems to take all the things that the band had tried previously (including their \\"technical peak\\" stage \\"2112\\" thru \\"Kings\\" - culminating with the masterpiece \\"Hemispheres\\") and looked for a new style and sound. Rush succeeded magnificently. I take my hat off to Alex, Geddy and Neal for working thru what they had achieved to date, and coming up with something so fresh and exciting. Shorter classics such as \\"Spirit of Radio\\" and \\"Freewill\\" combined superb musicianship and complexity contained within simpler song structures and \\"closer to home\\" lyrics. \\"JacobsLadder\\" and \\"Natural Science\\") showed the band incorporating new sounds and style to the \\"longer\\" compositions whilst maintaining melody and a rocking edge.    I really enjoyed this album and as my first Rush album it holds a special place for me. I hope you enjoy it to, it's excellent.
0307276902|3.0|<br />   I was pretty dissappointed in this book, the story line was too dragged out to actually keep my interest; also there were parts that just were't too realistic to be a true story. I buy quite a few books that Oprah recommends, but this was truely a dud in my book.
B00004W3L3|5.0|I remember buying this when it was first released in 1985 and rushing home to listen to it. It is one of few albums where upon the very first listen everything sounded fantastic, the whole album from start to finish was so well put together and I must have listened to it 20 times over the next few months. <br /> <br />What stands out to me are the very passionate and emotional lyrics and singing from Marillion's lead singer Fish. From the opening \\"Pseudo\\" through to the closing \\"White Feather\\" he never misses a note. As a couple of points of reference I feel his vocal style is similar in delivery to Peter Gabriel and Elbow's Guy Garvey in places (Fish's emotion and control on the high notes is the big difference for me). The story feels like a very personal one and is conveyed with such power that I could only feel \\"wow, this is someone putting it all on the line and sharing their deepest emotions with the listener\\". I feel that nothing beats a band or artist who is truly writing, singing and playing from the heart, and believe in what they are doing - rather than for someone else or some other agenda. I often think of this album as a shining example of that. I believe that this is what makes this album (and indeed the Bands next - \\"Clutching at Straws\\" - 1987) a true classic. <br /> <br />The band sound incredibly tight and everyone gives a great performance - Fish, Steve Rothery - Guitar, Mark Kelly - Keyboards, Ian Mosley - Drums and Pete Trewavas - Bass (who would also join up with Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), Neal Morse (Spock's Beard) and Roine Stolt (Flower Kings) to form a superb \\"sideline\\" band called \\"Transatlantic\\" in 2001). There are so many highpoints on this album (eg \\"Kayleigh\\", \\"Lavender\\" (the transition between these two songs is stunningly beautiful), and \\"Heart of Lothian\\". The best thing though is the whole albums flow (eg \\"Blind Curve\\" / \\"Childhoods End / \\"White Feather\\"), this \\"closing section\\" of the album at a combined 16 minutes in length is as emotional as anything I have heard. <br /> <br />In summary a real classic, a beautifully written, sung and played story from beginning to end that has power, passion, emotion and sublime playing in abundance. With Fish's lyrics / emotion / honesty / from the heart approach (and it appears leadership and direction) combined with the bands incredible sense of musical accompaniment  Marillion have produced a classic that to this day has new listeners saying... \\"Wow, who is that, it's brilliant!\\" That is the ultimate compliment for any music. 20 plus years old now and it still sounds great and sends shivers of emotion up my spine - stunning stuff! <br /> <br />I really enjoy this album, every time I play it, it brings back great memories of a tremendous band and their lead singer giving their all, it's superb. <br />
B0000025ZK|5.0|To put it real simply, Pink Floyd were having major issues in the mid-'80s.  Roger Waters pretty much wanted Pink Floyd to himself, as 1983's \\"The Final Cut\\" shows.  Seemingly fed up with Floyd, and with a reservoir of unused compositions built up, David Gilmour brought back Bob Ezrin as co-producer, recruited a whole bunch of extremely talented players (Pino Palladino, Jeff Porcaro, and Steve Winwood, to name a few), and went about making his second solo album, \\"About Face\\", originally released in March of 1984.      \\"About Face\\" is an interesting title for the album.  It could be taken as a sly jab of sorts at Waters.  It could also be applied somewhat to the music...  Granted, you really can't expect to completely take the Floyd out of Gilmour's sound, but it's not like fans would desire that of him anyway.   However, the album finds Gilmour in control and doing things his way--Pete Townshend wrote the lyrics for two of the songs (\\"Love On The Air\\" & \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\"), but otherwise, Gilmour wrote all of the tracks on the album himself--and David does have quite a few surprises up his sleeve here.    One thing that's pretty revelatory is to discover that Gilmour could deliver such an incredibly funky, uptempo pop-rocker with \\"Blue Light\\".  Using his patented guitar echo, Gilmour bases this song around a mind-blowingly infectious guitar riff, and the song is an absolute blast, with additional thanks to the punchy horn arrangement.  Also notice his very humourous, albeit slightly self-righteous spoken voiceover toward the end of the song.  Granted, you could argue that precedence was set by some of the stuff on \\"The Wall\\", but still, it's pretty hard to imagine hearing something like \\"Blue Light\\" cropping up on a Pink Floyd record.    Another striking element is that on a couple tracks, Gilmour sounds uncannily like Leonard Cohen, both in terms of the guitar-style and with the stately lead vocals.  There's \\"Cruise\\", which is breezy and splendidly tuneful;and \\"Near The End\\", which is a hauntingly beautiful album-closing ballad, with acoustic guitar soloing neatly giving way to a soaring electric toward the end.    And there's more great stuff.  The album-opening harmony-fest \\"Until We Sleep\\" is surprisingly reminiscent of psychedelic-era Beatles--a very catchy song that grooves along irresistibly.  The roaring \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\" is a brilliant, cathartic mid-tempo rocker with gloriously from-the-gut vocals from David on the chorus.  \\"Murder\\" is an explosive 'power ballad' of sorts that starts off in Dylan-esque acoustic mode and features sumptuously melodic fretless bass guitar work.  The contemplative orchestrated ballad \\"You Know I'm Right\\" is also excellent, with a rhythmically deceptive first verse, and a simple arpegiatted guitar part that recalls \\"Raise My Rent\\" from David's first solo album.    Others have complained about Gilmour's lyrics, saying things like \\"he's no Roger Waters\\" or that \\"writing lyrics isn't his forte\\".  Granted, he didn't exactly make \\"About Face\\" an elaborate concept album, but regardless of this, his lyrics here are uniformly excellent--poetic and eloquently-written--and his precise renderings make the most of them.    One minor gripe is that Gilmour does have a bit of a tendency to get carried away with his wailing, effect-laden electric guitar work.  Don't get me wrong, I realize it's a trademark of his, and on songs like \\"All Lovers Are Deranged\\", it simply rocks.  Sometimes though, it does feels out of place in the context of the particular track--the most glaring example of this is on the instrumental \\"Let's Get Metaphysical\\" which has Gilmour wailing away backed by a full orchestra, and in this case, it's just not an appealing combination.    Overall though, this album is an excellent \\"About Face\\" for David Gilmour, and I think it's worth a try even if you're NOT a huge Pink Floyd fan.  \\"About Face\\" is a must-have album for any serious listener.    (P.S.  Listening to this CD version of the album, I notice a surprising amount of 'drop outs' on several of the songs which can be somewhat distracting, and it makes me wonder about the source that was used for this CD transfer.  That said, this album could really use a nice remastering job.)
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you are already among all of us working stiffs, pushing buttons for some guy with a fancy car and his own personal parking spot... what ever you do don't rent 'Wall Street'!<br /><br />'Office Space' is one of those few movies that really brings the average day in office to true life. Eventhough there are some overly exageratted scenes in this movie (oh and they are extremly funny), there are so many things I myself pointed at the screen saying 'That happened to me!'<br /><br />This movie is not one to be missed it IS the movie you need to watch when you come home from work. The characters are great, Mike Judge even got the stereotypes correct in the software field. There is always a huge woman sitting at the front desk directing calls, there is always an Indian guy (if you have called Dell computers for assistance you know I am right.) And yes there is always a geekey looking guy who acts like a hot shot, whom you have to lick the scum off of his shoes everyday just to prevent yourself from getting fired.<br /><br />To Mike Judge and the cast of 'Office Space', thank you for showing us all how to stick it to the man because we are all too big of whimps to do it ourselves.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this series.  It's the perfect mix for someone who loves adventure, the old west, sci fi or just wonderfully written humor.  Give up canned, predictable lines and give this series a try.
0307276902|5.0|From the first page of this book, I was absolutely engrossed! The electrifying beginning is a precursor to the harrowing addiction memoir of James Frey. A raw and graphic journal of author Frey's experience of hitting bottom somewhere deep below sea level and finding himself a battered 23-year-old funneled to the country's best rehab facility, desperately hoping he can recover. Intelligent, visceral, this work should be mandatory classroom fare and nominated for something! <br /> <br />The story spans 400 pages which I seriously read non-stop in just two days! What really makes this book stand-out is the detailed and poetic way it reads. Frey's writing style is brutally honest and you cannot help but be drawn into his spiral of addiction so much that it becomes hard to turn the pages fast enough! Million Little Pieces truly redefines the saying `I just can't put the book down!'
B000AP04L0|5.0|Now, Office Space might look like a movie about this young guy whose whole viewpoint on cubicle hell is changed when his occupational hypnotherapist dies in the middle of a hypnosis session, leaving him with a wonderfully carefree attitude toward the job he despises - but it's not.  The real star of this movie is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root), the mumbling, thoroughly mistreated oddball who is pushed beyond his limits after the boss, among other things, steals his stapler.  He really loved that stapler, which is why he continued to use it after the company went with a completely different stapler manufacturer.  When you're stuck in a cubicle for forty hours a week and forced to watch all sorts of Who Stole My Cheese nonsense taking place all around you, when you're always the odd man out when the boss' yearly birthday cake gets handed out, when you're forced to change cubicles over and over again for no good reason whatsoever, you become Milton.  With no control over your life's direction, you cling to any little thing you can find in your three-walled domain - a favorite stapler, your chair (which you really should put your name on, if you want to make sure someone doesn't pull the old switcheroo on you), and the all-consuming importance of locks for your shelves (which the movie completely leaves out, for some reason).  Your bosses make fun of you behind your back and think of ways to make your life even more miserable, and you start mumbling all the time.  Yes, Milton truly represents those unfortunate enough to be trapped inside cubicle farms.<br /><br />However, since the movie does give young Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) and his buddies most of the screen time, I'll talk about them as well.  That Pete's really got his head on straight as the movie begins; he has already learned that work is a form of torture that makes every day worse than the one before until you get old and die.  His buddies at work are pretty spot-on as well, knowing that the hiring of a consultant means a labor reduction is imminent.  Then Peter sees this hypnotherapist who gets him nice and relaxed, with all of his work-related worries washed away - and keels over dead, leaving Peter in a state that can only be described as carefree.  He just stops going to work for awhile, but when he does pop in (just to pick up his address book), he goes ahead and talks to the two Bobs (the consultants).  His straight-shooting, incredibly honest answers about how little he actually does at the company convince the Bobs that he is upper management material.  While Peter's being promoted, though, his buddies Michael Bolton (David Herman) - no, he's not related to that dreadful singer - and Samir  Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) are being laid off.  That's when Peter comes up with a plan - well, actually, the whole idea was Michael's, but Peter talks him and Samir into actually doing it.  They plant a virus-type routine, designed to skim off a fraction of a cent from every transaction, inside the computer system.  The plan ends up working too well, though, putting Peter and the guys into quite a potential pickle.<br /><br />I think the film sort of loses its focus during the final half hour.  Up until that point, it's a dead-on parody of cubicle life.  You've got your fax machine designed to jam as often as possible, your boss who speaks to you as if you're intellectually challenged and never hears a word you say, a  whole range of annoying co-workers, etc..  The whole \\"Didn't you get the memo?\\" routine captures the very essence of life in the cubicle jungle.  A great supporting cast, including Jennifer Aniston as Joanna, a waitress who just says no to \\"flair,\\" and Diedrich Bader as Peter's next-door-neighbor, really round out the film remarkably well.  Even the genius behind the whole film, Mike Judge, joins the fun as Joanna's flair-obsessed manager.  Office Space is just a tremendously funny movie that shines the mirror of hilarious truth on the ridiculous nature offar too many modern companies.ure of far too many modern companies.
B00008MZ0O|4.0|The movie is definately meant for us guys. What else could you want? It has fast cars and hot chics. My favorite part of the movie (other than the hot chics) is The Beast. The early 70's charger that's maxed out. Not only is it a beautiful car to look at, but it's got enough horses to satisfy anyone. You know it's been done right with the last drag race they do. I won't spoil the movie any more than that.

B0002IVN9W|3.0|After having so many of my friends ask me if I listen to Arcade Fire, I decided it was finally time to give them a try, so I picked up this album.  Honestly, I am not impressed at all.  I give the album three starts because it's definately on the good side - it's not a BAD album to listen to, but it doesn't DO much for me.  Specifically, I find that it doesn't really provide much of an original sound that you can't find in most of the other indie rock that everyone seems to be listening to these days.  The die hard fans may think I'm crazy, but I really don't care.
B000059QY3|3.0|I am amazed at the extreme praise for Gheorghiu's Violetta. She is lovely and intense, and has an interesting voice, but is hardly the greatest Violetta in our memories.Has no one seen the video of Blanca's Violetta from the Bellas Artes with Villazon? You could not possibly view this document and not find Madame Blanca's performance less than Gheorghiu's. For one thing, the Spanish soprano's handling of the music in the first act is infinitely superior in every way. She is fearless in the coloratura, always solid in her pitch and execution, and manages to touch the heart with her desperate bravura in the face of the future she knows will defeat her.  <br />I have heard and seen many famous Violettas, and would certainly rank Blanca's equal to the best. I could not accord this place to Miss Gheorghiu.
B000000OUE|5.0|Boy, if the only \\"metal\\" you kiddies have been exposed to is that whiny HIM junk, I pity you.    THIS is a REAL industrial-metal album. If that's what you want, this is one you're gonna want.    The pounding, heart-pumping drive of \\"Supercharger Heaven\\". (DEVILMAN, DEVILMAN!)  The riff-driven \\"Creature Of The Wheel\\".  The ominous-sounding opener, \\"Electric Head: The Agony (Pt. 1)\\".  The hit, \\"More Human Than Human\\".  And so many more.    Also, the fun, B-movie horror theme (artwork, samples, lyrics) that has come to be associated with Rob Zombie's work is clearly present, and it's campy and really adds to the album.    This is a loud, proud 90's staple. Check it out if you wanna scare all the Yellowcard fans.

B00005JNRE|3.0|Oh, this movie uses magic, but that's not what I mean. It starts with a houseful of out-of-control kids and their widowed father. They are tamed by the magical Nanny from nowhere, and everyone (not just the kids) learn their lessons. There's the happy ending you've been waiting for since the first five minutes, then the Nanny vanishes off into wherever she came from. There is material worth watching here, but it doesn't come from the plot.<br /><br />I guess I find the implication a bit discouraging: that only supernatural intervention can turn a kid into a reasonable human being. Also, towards the end, we see the \\"nanny's quarters\\" in the attic - dusty, unfurnished, with big cracks open to the weather, and with plaster falling off the walls. No wonder Mr. Brown couldn't keep good help.<br /><br />If you don't get your hopes up too far, it's good entertainment. CG effects are minimal but well done, until an outstanding sequence at the end. Characters are cartoonish and colorful, where color is helpful. There are some \\"Home Alone\\"-style shenanigans, but done in a teamwork format. Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, and Angela Lansbury bring effective star power to this production, but fail to lift it above the ordinary. I found Nanny McPhee amusing and kid-safe, but largely forgettable.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005JOFO|4.0|This is a superb film - great direction, first-rate acting, enthralling simple story without special effects or melodrama.  Ang Lee's director award is well-deserved.  It will be a classic of its kind in 10 years. <br /> <br />There were a few glitches in the film, though: Gyllenhaal's aging process needed more work, especially towards the end of the film when he was supposedly 20 years older.  In the scene where they had their last fishing trip, when Jack saw Ennis riding off on horseback, he had a full mustache.  Then there was a 2-second close up on his face, which became clean-shaven.  When it cut to the frame where Jack leaned on his car seeing Ennis off, the mustache was back. <br /> <br />The movie's sound track was minimalist. A nice score or memorable theme song would help attract more audience at the box office - this is just my opinion.  It is a great film as it stands.

B0001Z52RU|2.0|While I tried hard to like this, I found the acting so mediocre and the plot twists so outlandish, that I simply could not forget that this was a made-up thing and believe it for a time.  The actors all seem like amateurs - there is little chemistry between would-be lovers and friends, just lousy acting.<br /><br />ALso, it is not very good sci-fi:  I mean, like his dad this guy just has some kind of power to go back in time and change things by looking in his diary or at old photos (but not otherwise!).  Then, once he's back in the present, he can remember how things were, unlike anyone else who's affected.  While the ways that things change with his meddling is intriguing, it was too lacking in subtlty to seduce my imagination.  So I just couldn't believe any of it.<br /><br />Not recommended.

Also the extras show you how they did some of the things in the movie.
B000002LA2|5.0|This CD was an extraordinary musical achievement. If you have a sense for pop music above the average (and superbly produced, too), and are a man with a heart that can yearn sweetly or painfully for a new love or an old love lost, this music is yours.  <br /> <br />Load your pining and pain on this streamliner of a CD and you will have salve for your souls. AUGUST is pure medicine for that one particular special situation previously mentioned. I don't see people liking it so much for general consumption as for a needed tonic when love and loss are in the current experience of the listener. This music is no downer -- it moves like a station-bound train. <br /> <br />I read the critical reviews here a few weeks ago, and on first impression they are by well-meaning hyper-purists within the blues-ish and free form guitar camp. Lets not pick nits. We all love Eric Clapton -- but you are wrong about this album. It is a tight and powerful package of feeling-driven songs of power, love and passion. <br /> <br />With nine of the twelve tracks here being pure rubies, this CD far surpasses standard application of my \\"50 percent\\" test -- *IF* half of the tracks on a given music release are good, it passes. <br /> <br />I will add that much of the terrific 1980's music (superb as it was), sounds to the 21st century ear as being a tad heavy on the drums. AUGUST uses drums most truly, but they do not mar the production by being overly hard or too upfront. They hit the spot sweet spot but are not overdone. <br /> <br />I bought this 1986 album on vinyl in 1987 and I couldn't tell people enough about it at that time. I've been listening to this CD again -- and repeatedly -- this month. Sonic medicine for the heart...
B00005JOFO|5.0|To say that Brokeback Mountain is a bold film may seem like a foregone conclusion for some.  I was surprised by how the film handles its subject - two rugged cowboys dealing with the fact that they have fallen in love with each other - considering that this may be the most boldly gay film to be released in mainstream American cinema.   <br /> <br />Heath Ledger is Ennis Del Mar, a classic movie cowboy.  Ennis is very much a man's man.  He doesn't speak much; he takes as much pleasure from working than most anything else; and he likes to unwind with a cigarette and some whiskey at the end of the day.  Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhall, is a would-be rodeo cowboy, although he's not very good at it.  Jack daydreams and hopes to achieve his vision of bullriding success.  The two are paired together on a job tending sheep on a mountain (yes, Brokeback Mountain) in Wyoming in the summer of 1963.  One of them is to sleep high up near the sheep, while the other camps at the base of the mountain to guard the flock from other threats.  One night after a little too much whiskey, the two find themselves in the same tent, and awkwardly they act on their confused feelings for each other.  This scene is one of the most uncomfortable scenes in film, although this seems to be the intent.  These two don't know how to act out these feelings, and what's more, they know that society tells them that it's wrong.  Nonetheless, they continue to indulge themselves.  When the summer ends, they attempt to go back to 'normal.'  Ennis is getting married (to real life love Michelle Williams), and not long after he has two girls in close proximity to each other.  Jack meets a cute Rodeo girl (Anne Hathaway) who falls for him, and they in turn get married.  They have a son, but for Jack and Ennis, they can never replace what they had with each other. <br /> <br />This film is difficult on many levels.  Those who are uncomfortable with homosexuality will not want to see this movie.  As a straight man who has known several gay men, I found much of this movie a little awkward at least.  The emotions feel real, though, and there is a real sensitivity to what these men might have gone through.  The acting from all four principals is very good, and Ang Lee's directing is perfect; he knows when to be subtle and when to pour it on.  Great film, but be ready to struggle with your own emotions here.  Final grade - A
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Plot: Officer Murphy runs into a nasty confrontation with a criminal gang lead by ruthless killer and druglord Clarence Boddicker while on duty in the rough city of Detroit. The gang ends up blowing him to pieces limb by limb and leaves him for dead. He might seem to be just another unfortunate casulaty in the war on crime, but the local police force has a secret plan for his remains. They build the ultimate crimefighter: Robocop, a half human half machine cyborg programmed for justice. Yet while crime rate does take a plunge, there is an even bigger conspiracy going on behind closed doors that is linked with the very string of criminals they are pretending to protect the city against. Now it is up to Robocop to put an end to the corruption and restore order to the citizens. Of course, that's going to be a difficult job with Boddicker back on his tail with more determination than ever.<br /><br />Robocop is undeniably a classic action flick. And it's easy to see why. Most notably, it's got what everybody wants in a film like this: lots of action. I had forgotten just how to-the-point and nonstop the action is here. Not to mention some amazing special effects and makeup work. The graphicness of the violence is about as extreme as one can get if he's wanting to stay with a realistic approach. And it works beautifully. Which moves my point on to one of my favorite aspects of the movie: Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker. The character it so delighfully heartless that it actually adds a dark charisma to him. And I doubt the effect of it would have been as gripping as it was if it hadn't have been for Smith's wonderful acting. Peter Mullen, who plays Murphy/Robocop, is also an obviously superb choice in casting. He's believable and easy to sympathize with, which is an important thing for this storyline. And I think that's one of the best parts about Robocop: it's message. Arguably one of the greatest revenge stories ever to hit the screen, I don't think anyone can overlook the power behind it. After all that Murphy had been through, even despite having his memory tampered with, his previous life and very identity discarded like a piece of trash, the last line says it all. When Robocop is asked what his name is, he simply replies, \\"Murphy\\".<br /><br />Full of satire regarding how desensitized society has and will become towards crime and despicable human behavior, Robocop will strike some as a heroic return to basic morals and much-needed justice. But even if you're not looking to be preached to, these things are subtle and only support in an underlying way what this film has come to be known as. The perfect example of a kickass action flick! And as for the MGM edition DVD (which is the one I own) you won't even care it's not the Criterion director's cut. Most people make it sound like the uncut version is much gorier, but one viewing of this DVD will convince you that those differences are so small that there's no need to go out of your way to pick up the expensive and out of print Criterion version. It may only have a few trailers as it's extras, but by all means this edition is a perfect buy for anyone who wants to own the movie. It has a crystal clear print and great audio. So pick it up and enjoy the timeless experience of every action fan's dream: Robocop!power behind it.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity, based on the short lived TV series \\"Firefly,\\" is essentially a space western, or a cowboy sci-fi story, depending on your vantage point.  Although \\"Firefly\\" lived a shourt television life, it was released on DVD and found a new audience there.  Now, armed with the original cast, a bigger budget, and a good script, Joss Whedon, the mind behind \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" brings his trademark imagination and wit to his feature directing debut. <br /> <br />In a future where space is still being discovered and colonized by humanity, Malcolm Reynolds and his ragtag crew aboard the Serenity are getting by as a crew of smugglers and thieves, doing odd jobs wherever they can.  When an assassin tracks them down, looking for the young girl River, questions arise as to River's shady past.  Is she a killing machine?  What does she know?  Colflicts arise among the crew; some of them want her to be gone, sparing them extra trouble, while her brother, the ship's doctor, insists that she can be saved and will not kill the ship's crew. <br /> <br />The story takes many turns but stays interesting throughout.  The cast, all pretty much unknown, perform as a solid ensemble.  The effects are beautiful and virtually seamless.  This is a breath of fresh air.  Final grade: A
B00005MP58|5.0|Great movie. Great gift.  Bought two for gifts for others who already had the movies on VHS but wanted it on DVD so that they could always have it as technology moves on.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see Brokeback Mountain.  I knew what the plotline was, I knew where it took place and I knew that I wanted to see it.  I never expected to be completely blown away by it. <br /> <br />The performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are phenomonal.  Ledger plays the 'brooding' Ennis with such clarity that you feel like he is Ennis.  Gyllenhaal's character is the 'go-getter,' the one who is not afraid to 'be in love.'  He plays Jack with such passion and vivaciousness that its hard not to cry when he tells Ennis that \\"He can't quit him.\\" <br /> <br />In fact, my only problem with this movie is the not the movie at all but that society dictated that they weren't supposed to love each other and therefore, never told one another how they felt...although they both knew how the other felt. <br /> <br />It is an excellent movie...one I will be purchasing as soon as it comes out to DVD.  Now all's I have to do is buy the book.
1400032717|5.0|With well over 1,000 review already posted here at the time I'm writing this, there's no point in summarizing the story yet again. Let me just add my five stars to the mix by saying that I was surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this book. The author obviously went to great lengths to learn about autism and how it manifests itself in those afflicted with it. Throw in a very clever story and the result is an outstanding work of fiction.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Like the series the movie is based on - Firefly - the movie has a good story, good acting, and the right amount of action. It ties things up nicely, but leaves you hoping for a sequel.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|This may not be the best CD to start your Coltrane collection off with - many fans find it hard to appreciate a 20 minute song - however, the depth and pure elegance of this CD is well worth the purchase. Don't be dissuaded by criticisms of its sound quality. While not the best, there is an authenticity - enhanced by the additions of the radio-broadcaster himself - that lend a very personal feel to it. Some of Coltrane's best soprano work with the quartet.
B00006AUIG|4.0|Between 'Session 9' and 'The Machinist' Brad Anderson has established himself as a horror director to watch for. (Now I know you're telling me 'The Machinist' isn't a horror movie, but a 'Psychological Thriller'. True enough, but that's close enough for me, and it still amounts to maybe 3/4 of horror film, and the 3/4 that matter the most at that.) Hopefully it'll turn out that he's really particularly interested in horror films, rather than he just happened to make those 2 films. Good new horror director's are in relatively short supply, and the old guard is gettin' pretty old by now. Anyway, many of the more hyped horror films of recent years make a big deal out of being a return to gruesome, hard-hitting horror of the 70's. Anderson takes a different approach, stripping away the violence largely and focusing on visuals and atmosphere. I like pretty much all approaches to horror, but I think this one is the very best, provided it has some sort of payoff at some point. And, frankly, I think 'Session 9' takes this approach a little too far, and could stand for a little more payoff, perhaps few more concrete occurrences in the first 70 minutes of the film. Still, it works very well as it is, even if Anderson tries to push the material a little too far.<br /><br />Like so many of the better horror films, 'Session 9' is scenario, rather than plot, oriented. Basically, a Hazmat crew is sent into the old, abandoned Danvers mental hospital in order to clean out the asbestos in preparation for renovation. (They had to close it down some years before, cause all the patients were going crazy! haha, haha,ha, [clears throat] haha. Ahh.  Not actually true by the way, closed down due to scandals and a lack of funds.) It is, in short, a Haunted House film, a crazy house, in this case. It was the Danvers hospital (in Massachusetts, I believe) itself that inspired the film, and it was shot there pretty much entirely on location, apparently with a relative minimum of set decoration. It's a very creepy place no matter how you look at it; Huge and imposing but it also looks like it might fall apart at any moment and full of all sorts of disturbing little things that remind you that this is indeed a mental hospital, along with the just generally harsh and angular architecture. There are a number of particularly disturbing images: the long, underground tunnels; an old restraint chair located directly in the center of a large room; the mesh fences used to separate the patients from the staff and prevent suicides. Some of the more negative reviews have claimed that the locale is pretty much all the film has going for it. Even if that were the case, this might not be too bad of a film.  It's just a great locale.<br /><br />During the commentary track it's mentioned that 'The Shining' was a major inspiration for the film. This isn't hard to see, as the camerawork often mimics that film extensively, particularly while they're exploring the hospital. (It also has some similar plot elements, in that it's a haunted place that adversely effects the occupants' psyches rather than simply killing them personally.) 'Session 9' is also particularly interesting in that it has a cast that is far different from what you'd usually see in a horror film: The main characters are all male, blue collar workers. Though the film doesn't have an overwhelming amount of character development, these guys are all generally pretty sympathetic, in that they tend to be particularly concerned with real-world issues, and just generally seem like regular guys rather than film characters. Performances are strong across the board, particularly for a film with such a small budget. (1.5 million, I'm told.)<br /><br />Like I said, the film is pretty slow-moving, with most of what happens in the first half of the film simply amounting to spooky cinematography, eerie, atonal music, voices and the disturbing tapes found in the library by one of the characters. (They're recordings of therapeutic sessions with one Mary, a murderer with multiple personalities. This seems like a somewhat hackneyed device, but it worked on me. When the murderous Simon personality finally appears on the tape he proves to be really very creepy.) We also get to see how the hospital effects each of them personally, as most of them seems to have a particular obsession related to the job which eats at them more and more as the film moves on. At about the 70 minute mark things really start to fall apart, though it is still fairly restrained in a lot of ways. Much of the time we don't really get to see what happened at the time, only the aftermath. I'd never say the film really gets to be out and out terrifying, but it's pretty creepy and intense in these later moments.<br /><br />The final revelation isn't especially impressive, but I don't think they were really expecting for it to be too mind blowing or anything. It mostly just helps to keep us in the dark a bit to enhance the mood. There is one very cool revelation towards the end, that I can't give away in specific. (It involves a certain character who disappeared midway thru the movie and has returned acting very strangely. The neat thing is why he's acting the way he does.)<br /><br />Ehh, I got nothing else to say. I liked it.<br /><br />Grade: B+Mary, a murderer with multiple personalities.

B000024L5R|5.0|This Audio CD is excellent. The music is very nice. All the songs are excellent.
B0009R1T7M|4.0|Bought this album based solely on the reviews... trying to find exposure to new and interesting music.  WOW was I impressed.  Not too into all the instrumental tracks, but the full on \\"songs,\\" fantastic.  Took a few listenings to appreciate it but I've found that is the pattern I've had with all of my favorite albums.  Led me to check out Michigan as well.  Definitely would recommend this album!  It really is one of the top 5 albums of 2005 for good reason.  Will definitely be awaiting the other 48 state's albums to come.
B000002JAX|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband.  He says it reminds him of being in a smoky bar in New Orleans.  Madeleine has a very soothing, relaxing voice.  We play this a lot for dinner music.  It invites long conversations and after-dinner-drinks.  How nice is that?
0140120416|5.0|Russian learners should feel privileged to have this language course readily available to them.  I've self-studied various foreign languages using text resources and this far and away blows all the others out the water.  This is, as it says, \\"A Complete Course for Beginners.\\"  It's thorough, has a coherent structure and is actually quite enjoyable to read.  For example, I always worried about my abilities in Russian due to need to memorize the Cyrillic alphabet.  This is the first thing that Mr. Brown addresses and, low and behold, I was able to entertain myself in the first lesson by gradually translating the given word prompts.  It really is a fun and productive introductory course for learning the foundations of the Russian language.  If you are a beginner, this is THE Russian book to buy.  And it's so cheap!
B00005QW4K|4.0|It's a cult classic that doesn't forget it's B movie roots despite the fact it was mainstreamed into actual theaters. Why do I need to say anymore. Either you love it or hate it; there isn't much middle ground. It's not like many people buy DVD's that they haven't seen yet based upon reviews. What I can comment on is the many different versions that have been saturating the market.<br /><br />I have the original release with a chainsaw on one of ash's arm and that hottie on the other.  Contains the original theatrical cut of the film. The picture quality isn't quite perfect, but watchable. Short on extras, but I rarely pay much mind to extras anyway. The one draw back is that it's NON-anamorphic for those of you who have HDTV's. Still, not a bad version to have.<br /><br />I also have the one in the plain brown wrapper aka the official bootleg version. Contains the unfortunate director's cut. I'm sure the word bootleg is used to refer to the picture quality. The daytime scenes look fine, but the many night scenes look awful. All the contrast is washed out and can barely be seen at all. Not recommended for that reason alone.<br /><br />The screw head edition on Blu-Ray. Sharp cleaned up picture with vivid high contrast colors, brought to you in full widescreen glory. This is the edition to have.<br /><br />There are many other versions available as well, but I can't comment on them. At least not yet.
0399143904|3.0|I had never read a Tom Clancy novel before \\"Rainbow Six\\", and this one left me wondering if I want to read another. It weighs in at 740 pages, but didn't need to be nearly that long. <br /> <br />In college I had a film professor who told us \\"So what if it's long if the story takes a while to be told?\\" Well in this case there is a big story, but it really could have been told more concisively. Clancy takes several points and just beats them to death: okay, we get it that John Clark would rather be doing the soldier's duty then being in command, but he realizes he's too old. Okay, we get it that the Rainbow troops are the best at what they do and enjoy their equipment and enjoy their work, but understand that it's hard to feel good about killing people even if they bring it on themselves. Okay, we get it that the former KGB agent wants to understand why his employer is having him do all these weird things, but he can't figure it out. Okay, we get it that things have changed a lot for former Soviet spies since the end of the Cold War. These are just a few of the points that Clancy pounds into the reader's head with all the subtlety of a jackhammer. <br /> <br />The last 250 pages were frankly rather dull, and if I hadn't been 2/3 of the way through I might have stopped reading it altogether. Clancy just seems determined to show everyone how much he knows about military hardware and philosophy, and after a while it borders on pretentious. The John Clark character didn't seem to me to be that fleshed out at all, which really surprised me. He seemed to get lost among everything else that was going on, which was disappointing. <br /> <br />I chose to read this book because I like the game that was based on it (or is it the other way around?) Hopefully the rest of Clancy's library is more interesting than this bloated tome.
1594200653|5.0|There is little to add to the various (and most interesting) pro and con comments. <br />I would like to address -- only -- the question of footnotes, and would appreciate others' opinions. <br />There are, in my opinion, two aspects to this subject: (1) The relative paucity; and (not mentioned, but important to me and evident in this book) the placement of the footnote on the pertinent page. <br /> <br />The question of how well-documented a book should be with copious (or selective) footnotes is surely debatable, and 'chacun a son gout'. <br /> <br />I applaud placing the relative footnotes (be they few or many) on the relative page, since I tire of flipping back to the end each time and often having to find which chapter first, etc., etc., ad nauseam. <br /> <br />I am not sure Amazon is anxious for their comments to become a locus for discussion between commentators; but if they permit this, I would encourage feedback on this subject, since it was discussed -- admittedly tangentially. <br /> <br />This is a very fine book; very readable (despite some commentators' feeling otherwise); in fact, I was pleasantly surprised to find how readable it was considering its subject and the large amount of material presented. <br /> <br />By all means buy, if this subject interests you; it is unusually comprehensive and readable.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|Everything about this movie was about being a victim.  The evil corporations, the impotent and diseased Colonial government, the crusader who (of course) was murdered for standing-up for her beliefs.  Ugh, should be the \\"poster-boy\\" movie for the liberal left.  Very predictable ending as well.   <br /> <br />Sound track and scenery of Africa was well done, hence the 2 star rating
B000BRBA8S|4.0|I'd been wanting to see this one since I saw the super-cool trailer for it well over a year ago, and after missing it at the local arthouse theatre, I was glad to finally see it on DVD. Although I haven't seen all of Won Kar Wai's films, I knew that 2046 would be sumptuous to look at, but hoped that it would steer clear of some more of his vague tendencies.<br /><br />That's not to say that I mind non-linear storytelling in films, because I really do if it's done well. 2046 had a fascinating concept in that it pulled together both a period piece (the late 60s) about a journalist and writer while at the same time blending in futuristic subplots (based around the writing of the aforementioned character). I was correct to expect that the film would be a feast, and it seems that all the stops are pulled out on this film, with just about every shot oozing with gorgeous color, awesome framing, and other little tricks that pull the viewer in.<br /><br />That said, the film is frustrating at times, in more ways than one. Although it makes for some beautiful visuals, the futuristic elements of the story never feel like they quite mesh with the rest of the story, and while there are some interesting plays on time elapsing, the film is also broken up with overl pretentious chapter-headings like \\"All Memories Are Traces Of Tears.\\" In addition, the film makes vague references to cultural events taking place in the region at the time, but never really delves into them. That's a small nitpick, but since it doesn't seem to affect the characters at all in their insular little world, it feels a bit distracting to even bring them up.<br /><br />Now that I've mentioned what annoyed me, I will say that the acting was uniformly outstanding. Lead man Tony Leung was great as a character that exudes smoothness in an attempt to cover his hollow emotional core, while Zhang Ziyi gave what might be her most varied performance yet (from playful to cold to emotionally shattered).<br /><br />The structure (or lack thereof) will turn off a lot of viewers, but when the film really gets down to business, it's quite good. In that regard, it should probably be more frustrating to me (especially given the less-than-sympathetic main character), but I still mostly enjoyed it and had my jaw dropped by the lavish visuals for a good portion of the film (which may indeed be why I was willing to overlook some of the less-cogent sections)./>The structure (or lack thereof) will turn off a lot of viewers, but when the film really gets down to business, it's quite good.

B0000640VO|4.0|If your not the type to rent horror videos,and you have seen the same formula action movies over and over, this is for you.  Amelie is a delightful story of how one young girl makes a discovery, becomes a do-gooder, and blossoms into adulthood.  Splendidly cast without a single hollywood regular to skew the experience. No crime scene investigation, or blood and guts.  A movie for those who like a good story.
B000002L9J|5.0|If you are clever and lucky in this life, you realize that somethings and some people  are unique in their beauty and only come along once in a lifetime. Such is the case with the Smith's The Queen Is Dead, this album/disc is no mere pop confection, cranked out amongst the zillions of others from that decade. No this  is a finely crafted masterpiece, much like the work of a talented author, it is more of a document or an article of declaration,  than a mere pop record. This was the soundtrack to life for so many youth of its time. The Smiths were a one of a kind event that occurred for a brief moment in time. That happened in a quick,brilliant flash and then burned out, let us thank the heavens for recorded music.

B00005JKN9|4.0|I am not a Decaprio fan by any means but he was a step above bearable in this movie.   It was Daniel Day-Lewis that made this movie.   Outstanding acting.  Lewis's character could have really become 2 dimensional by making him a 2 dimensional jingoistic racist, which would have really killed the movie.    But even though he really was a jigoistic racist, you were really drawn to him in an empathetic way. <br /> <br />This movie is very violent and quite gory.  There also seems to be no moral framework in any area of life - casual sex, corrupt cops, firemen that fight while a burning building is looted, public hangings for entertainment, etc, etc.   None of it really would have really made sense if I did not put it in the proper context of the era. <br /> <br />The storyline was nicely packaged - leader 1 kills leader 2 ; leader 2's son grows up and comes back to kill leader 1 in the final scene.   3 hours was probably a bit long but you know over all it was a good movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis's acting was so compelling that I could have watched him all day. <br />
B00005JOQ9|1.0|<br />Just got through watching the film.  To put it mildly, it sucked.  The acting was horrible, althought some of the blood-gore effects were OK.  But this wasn't really a horror movie as advertised.  It was a soft-core porn film for at least half the first part of the movie almost and then just suddenly shifted into a totally dumb series of torture for money scenario.  ?What is more it then shifts again into another genre: action.  The last would-be victim suddenly goes into Rambo-mode and starts taking out the villains wholesale.  So what is it?  Well, it is part porno, part slasher-gore, and part action movie.  But it really isn't horror.   <br /> <br />And this is the most stupid part of the movie.  Supposedly this is based on a real incident.  You know what that \\"real incident\\" was?  Apparently Roth got the idea for Hostel when he was supposedly surfing the net for what he admits was sick stuff.  On the Jimmy Kimmel Live Show, Roth has he found a website in Tailand which was advertising the service of anyone coming down to then walk into a room where a person would be tied to a chair to be shot in the head.  Supposedly the website said the person was a willing participant.   <br /> <br />Perhaps this is true.  Who knows.  I cannot find any such website on the net though.  Perhaps, if we are willing to believe this, this was started by a group of HIV infected people, in which AIDS is rampant in Tailand.  Perhaps this is a way for effectively a doom person to collect some money to go to their family.  But this is total speculation and again entertaining the idea that this supposedly \\"real incident\\" is, well, real. <br /> <br />At any rate, the way this allegedly \\"real incident\\" is then shown in the movie Hostel is totally inconsistent with how Roth accounts the \\"real incident.\\"  In the movie, people are just kidnapped and tortured and clearly not willing participants. <br /> <br />I agree with some other reviewers on here that there is some attempt, or so it seems, to make some political commentary.  But it is so undefined and froth with other inconsistencies already pointed out by other reviewers, such as the fact that there is a rather sadistic American who is also torturing foreignors, particularly wiht a penchant for severing the eye of an Asian woman. <br /> <br />And the realism of the film was, well, unrealistic.  Like tons of people are being killed, where literally piles of bodies are layered on carts and no one seems the wiser of this all going on.  Give me a break. <br /> <br />The acting was really bad, particularly by the two female \\"actresses\\" who were nothing but cheap eye candy.  The bad acting really showed and was genuinely laughable at times.  Even the mafia-like boss, or we are lead to believe it is the boss, of this \\"industry\\" is so stereotypical: black cloths, bold head, automatic in hand and cheezy one-syllable accented interogatives and commands like \\"Zamerican?\\" and \\"Talkz!\\" <br /> <br />I just feel so bad for poor Slovania, which is shown in a rather poor light, as a deteriorating city in which demonic little homicidal kids run rampant literally killing people for candy.  Just retarded, even though it might elicit a chuckle or two. <br /> <br />As for the ending, yeah people are rooting at the end, but it is to see the bad guys get it, much like in High Tension were the tables are viciously turned on the bad guys again. <br /> <br />Anyway Roth is a dumb writer and director.  There isn't any decent dialgue or plot in the movie, no real acting, and the scenarios so unrealistic that you cannot help but notice just how dumb it all is.  Seriosuly man, it is almost painful to watch how bad this film is.  And seeing the small to medium size breasts of silly-acting tarts prancing about doesn't make up for it either. <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|I have to begin by saying that it has been a very long time since I have seen a film with such enormous, emotional intelligence and resonance as this work displays.<br /><br /> The scenic quality of the film is utterly, breathtakingly, beautiful and the musical score is every inch as gentle and fragile as the love story it underpins. The lead actors are outstanding, Ennis [Heath Ledger, who gives no hint of his Australisian heritage] is darkly brooding and guarded, damaged as he is by early experiences of poverty, intolerence and fear. Jack [Jake Gyllenhaal] is dramaticly more available, passionate and needs driven than his lover. Their love is a tender and tragic pot-boiler which resonates an aching sense of longing and of both hope and hopelessness. These two young actors express levels of experience and pathos way beyond achievements their ages would suggest an aptitude for, being actually 25 and 24 respectively. Oscar and BAFTA nominations and indeed wins, simple must be in the offing for both. It has echoes of films like \\"Far from Heaven\\", in which Julianne Moore battles with social order versus desire, longing, want and love.<br /><br />Utterly beautiful both physically and emotionally and a film which has much to document about the power of love and attraction and the destruction of hatred and bigotry.<br /><br /> As stunning an interpretation of Annie Proulx's delightful novella, as it would be possible to produce.<br /><br /> A certain and indelable, must see of a film.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|With the annoying choir music playing in the background as limbs are hacked and blood squirts all over the place, this movie seemed more like a comedy to me than an honest-to-goodness horror thriller.  Roth completely lacks the talent of building suspense and developing a story thread for character buildup.  Unlike other horror movies, we have no real sense of connection for the victims or really feel like we are with them in the story.  Compare the master of suspense and horror, Stephen King, which someone pointed out on here already.  King first builds the characters up and we get to know them and care for them, and then the monsters come out.  Instead of character development and plot we are given what is really an HBO style porn movie featuring two pale looking Eastern European women that look like they could be in a Valtrex commercial.  After that the movie then turns in a slasher flick, where there is just one dumb mask wearing goofball after the other slicing and dicing people up.  The end of the movie then features the last survivor who goes Terminator on the bad dudes asses.  I mean come one!  This had to be a sick version of a comedy, right?  But maybe it is just me, for I remember laughing my butt off when I read Romeo and Juliet thinking it was a comical commentary on high-brow social distinctions instead of beng a genuine tragedy.  Whatever.  This movie though was just plain dumbass lame man.  I think Roth needs to get his butt back into film school or start studying the classics and read up on the masters of the genre he believes he is contributing to here. <br /> <br />Save your bucks and go see Wolf Creek.  Much better acting and a lot scarier and entertaining.  Don't get sucked into the hype of this dumb movie. <br /> <br />Nuff said!
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This season is a must have for all Gilmore Girls fans! Definitely one of the best so far!
B0002OERI0|2.0|I agree with the earlier posts that Jesus of Suburbia totally rips off \\"Summer of 69\\"...then it gets worse...It rips off a country song...(I read the graffiti,In the bathroom stall,Like the holy scriptures in a shopping mall)  sounds suspiciously similar to Kenny Chesney's \\"Good Stuff\\". What a joke!
B000000OYQ|4.0|I'm keep revisiting this cd otherwise I'd miss it.  I listen intently and intentionally to go around the singing voices (except for Robert's voice which is always a nice surprise) to hear every note Jimmy plays.  The gorgeous guitar zounds that bend, blum and sweetly twang are exceptional. Only Jimmy brings out the best, and no one can make a guitar talk like he can!  He puts sooo much into each body of work he does...a sort of above and beyond the call of duty...the lush textures and voluminous sound; and among other qualities, the way he holds onto a note and it's so perfectly (blues) smooooth into the next.  Unlike Robert's singing which is equal and complementary to Jimmy's playing, these cd singers seem only to accompany Jimmy's playing as a background singer or instrument would do...they sound like they're along for the ride in Outrider, but well done.  I need Jimmy to do more instrumentals and Robert to do more singing duets.  I think these songs should remain in Jimmy's orbit as they do in mine, and \\"Hummingbird\\" is staying in my novelette.  OBTW, RE EMLS, IJWTS, TYFTBOMH.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|This set of concerts at Eric Clapton's home away from home, i.e., the Albert Hall in London, displays some of the best guitar playing he has done live in the last 20 years, and I've seen him enough times to know a little.  Besides his performance on The Concert For George, these shows prove that Eric can still get up for a show and remember what he is capable of.  Ginger Baker looks great and is right on, loving the spotlight on Pressed Rat and WartHog.   Man, how eerie is that voice.  As for Jack Bruce, well, he doesn't look quite as well as the other two, but he is on cue with vocals and bass.  Overall, a very nice set of music. I also bought the 2 cd set if the moving pictures aren't for you.  Just listen to that Concert For George if you haven't already worn out your first copy.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I didn't get to see this series when it was first on - but after getting hooked by the movie I had to get this series.  It is an excellent blend of humor, sci-fi and plain old gun slinging.  I recomment it!
B0007OCG56|4.0|If I had known how good this movie was, I would have went to see it at the movies instead of waiting for it to come on a movie channel.  The trailer didn't make it seem like a drama, I thought it was a comedy.  This was one of those movies where I didn't want to miss a minute (even if the restroom was calling).  Adam Sandler was surprisingly good and so was the rest of the cast.
0307276902|3.0|If you saw Oprah last week than you know what I mean by \\" Million little Lies\\". James why did you do it? You are an increadable writer with a real God given gift--you don't need to make things up to be a great writer. I would have given you a 4 or 5 before I saw your confessions on Oprah, but alas as a dissappointed fan I must give you a 3 now. Next time, please keep the truth.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Always the first movie in a colection is the worst one, and this one, clearly, isn't the exception. Boring story, regular performances by the actors and actresses...it actually made me fall asleep at the movie theatre when I went to see it! This movie had too many races and stupid fights and too much dialogue, that's what made this \\"adventure\\" movie a boring tape that really, really doesn't worth the money at all.<br /><br />But thank God the other Star Wars movies are great!
B000BKJ78K|4.0|If you like Star Wars you'll love this collection. It comes nicely packaged and is very convenient to watch all episodes one after another.
B0009O9LWK|4.0|George C.Scott is always magnificient in his performances of character parts. The story of \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a classic that will continue to be appreciated for ages to come. And there were some things missing that I liked about the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine movie of the '30s. But then Orson Wells is hard to surpass in any dramatic role.
0316779237|5.0|David Sedaris is absolutely the funniest author alive. All of his books make me laugh out loud & embarrass myself in public places, when I bring his books along. This one did not disappoint either.. FUNNY holidays tales that make the season brighter, or even out of season.. give you a healthy & hearty laugh. <br />I adore this man!
B00006WUWQ|4.0|I buy this becuase they make me laugh a lot, the only problem is that only the first movie contain subtitles in spanish the second only in english and the third anything but overall they're just fine.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I really liked this film.  It's a fitting homage to all those old serials and \\"Weird Science\\" magazines.  Personally, I love those old classics.  But I guess the movie fails in one respect because if you don't love 'em, you probably won't think much of the film.  Too bad.  But it just goes to show that you can't make a blockbuster motion picture that appeals to a niche market. <br /> <br />Well, I'm part of the niche, and I think this picture's just swell!  (To use some old fashioned venacular)  It's got daring heroes, plucky dames, and a good ol' fashion evil genius trying to destroy the world story.  I thought the dialogue was fun, and the characters terrific updates of old 50's standards. <br /> <br />I particularly enjoyed the dogfight sequences as Sky Captain flies his plane between skyscrapers as he fights weird mechanical flying machines.  Completely unbelievable, but so much fun. <br /> <br />So if you, like me, are a fan of Flash Gordon and his ilk then I highly recommend this film.  For anyone else, I just can't predict if you'll like it or not. <br /> <br />But like I said, I loved it.
0307236722|5.0|Martha's book on baking covers the gamut of baking with style and flair.  I have almost all of her books and count this as one of the best.  I received it for Christmas and have since bought and given it twice to my best friends.  You will enjoy having this in your library.
0440241588|4.0|What I like about Grisham is that one knows exactly what one's getting; not high literature, nor is it intended to be so, but creative, amusing, a page-turner. Though I must add that Grisham's ventures outside his typical style, such as The Painted House, were a welcome surprise.
0060736267|5.0|This book was a very good book. It was about a little girl, Francie, who grew up poor and became successful when she got older. She went to school and did part-time jobs. She went on to college with the support of her mother and with a lot of obstacles in her way. She also met a great guy. You have to read the book to really understand it. This book has foreshadowing and rising action in it. The author played out the book well. It keeps you interested and it makes you want to keep on reading. You want to know what happens at the end. It really is that interesting. I can't give this book any bad critique's, because it is a good book overall. It's a good book to learn about life. Life gets better and the saying, \\"there's always a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" is a good saying to describe this book.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Enjoy it thoroughly, although it's a different experience than their studio recordings.  It sounds like a different band because they don't play like they used to.  Jack Bruce doesn't have the vocal power, and therefore the immediacy, that his voice once did, but he's good in another way.  Buy it; you'll be glad you did.
031286504X|5.0|I bought this book because I heard that it inspired George Romero to create Night of the Living Dead.  The main story is amazing.  The only thing I didn't realize is that half-way through it turns into short stories.  'I Am Legend' is just one of about a dozen short stories - it being the longest.  I would read a whole series on the main concept though.  First rate.
B000059Z8J|4.0|I caught this on TV today and couldn't stop watching it. I hadn't seen it for years, but quickly remembered why it has been a favorite movie of mine since I was seven. Obviously this film means alot to many people, as it still gets reviews weekly. As a child, this movie got my imagination going as much as \\"Star Wars\\" did. Everything worked here. The story, humor, the great music, and more than anything else, Christopher Reeve. That may be the casting job of the decade. I know we get a new \\"Superman\\" movie this year, but Reeve will be impossible to top. I'm also still impressed with the effects, despite the fact this is from 1978. I thought \\"Superman II\\" was nearly as great, though the other two were only so-so. With the success of this series, I'm suprised it took so long to make the \\"Spiderman\\" and even the \\"Batman\\" films, and though I'm a fan of most comic-to-screen films, I think \\"Superman\\" flies the highest.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|If you like eerie ghost stories, this might be worth a look.  In the tradition of WHAT LIES BENEATH and GOTHIKA it makes for an entertaining ride.  Keep in mind, however, there is a difference between a horror movie & a ghost story.<br /><br />As with all Jennifer Connelly movies, the best feature of this one is........er........Jennifer Connelly.  She's my favorite actress and she could make a bad movie look good.  She can also make a good movie better, which she does here.  For all I care, Jennifer Connelly could become the supreme commander of the universe and I would greet the news with enthusiasm!<br /><br />As for the story, it is rather slow moving.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but don't watch this one expecting things to be constantly happening.  One of the biggest differences between a ghost story & horror film is suspense.  Ghost stories tend to have a lot of it, whereas horror flicks have little or no suspense.<br /><br />If you like  Jennifer Connelly and / or ghost themes, this one is worth checking out.  Besides Connelly, the rest of the supporting cast is quite good also.
0312958455|5.0|I just finished reading this book today.  This has only been my third Michael Connelly book that I have read.  I thought it was better than Black Echo, and right up there with Void Moon.  The story has lots of twists and turns, and the dialogue is intriguing.  I was able to delve into Harry Bosch's psyche through his interactions with his psychologist as well as many of the other characters.  Excellent book!!
1591840562|5.0|I got the book on Thursday on advice from a friend and devoured it. This thing looks like it has been in my grubby hands for years. The dog-eared pages and notes everywhere have doomed it to a long career being carried around in my bag. <br /> <br />There are so many excellent ideas and strategies for starting anything. I had dozens of \\"duh!\\" moments where I thought, \\"Why are we NOT doing this!?!\\" It's been my experience that books such as this contain all sorts of odd-ball ideas. This one just had good stuff. <br /> <br />I wish I had bought this a year ago.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|If you really need relationship advice, this series can help but it aint no longdistancerelationships.com! The book is great to have as a peice of television history. The comedic scenes are hilarious and the characters can't be beat. Enjoy!
B000AP04L0|4.0|One of the funniest corporate movies of all time... It is a movie that paradies the working corporate world and plays out the fantasies of millions of white collar workers across the nation.  This special edition with flair provides more laughs with deleted never before scenes and contains a great interview with creator mike judge... A MUST OWN FOR ALL DVD ENTHUSIASTS!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and this A&E miniseries presentation is a true to book version of the story. The DVD version is condensed in two volumes so the story flows with only one change of DVD, in contrast with the six VHS tapes with chapters format, and the same introduction at the beginning of the several chapters contained in each of the tapes. The Digital Widescreen presentation provides an amazing scenery and clarity of colors.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this show when it was a TV series and loved it, my son went to the movie and watched Sernity and loved it.  So for his birthday I bought him the TV series.  It's Scifi and I love action scifi movies.
B00005JO1R|5.0|I'm overseas and haven't got to see the move as of yet. But I've have seen the CMT video. I've never seen to actors more right for the part. They sounded exactly like the Cash's. I listened to country music all my life. It's the best performance that I ever witness by two individuals. My hats off to both of them. Can't wait to see the movie and buy the video. <br />Regards M.L.T.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Great installment to the first two movies. This is my favorite movie, second only to the epic of Superman:The Movie. It explains all of the origins and does not leave any question unanswered (except a casting question regarding the last scene...).<br /><br />Anyways, along with the feature film, the making of and other featurettes are enjoyable as well. Until Superman returns, this is the best update to a comic franchise yet.
B000002W9P|5.0|Yes, this album changed the metal scene forever and defined the path that Helloween would take forever. The first to have  the master of voice in melodic metal: Michael Kiske. This cd is a must have if you are a true fan.  Most of the songs were composed by Kai Hansen. He really gives a guitar lesson ( doing many distortions, which is part of his style,with that red and trebled Flying V)in this recording,especially in:     1-Twilight of the gods -> The intro is where Kai plays and razes . With Halloween this is my favourite.  The lyrics talk about gods in war (fantasy).What can I say? Perfection. Gorgeous ,bridge , chorus, everything.    2- Halloween - > 13 minutes long, it was the heaviest ( excluding some pieces from Dark ride like escalation 666) song Helloween ever recorded after Walls of Jericho. The lyrics really tell what the band is about.  The bit between the start and the 1st sung verse is very suitable for head banging. You may not resist.  Kiske sings for a while and then one cool guitar solo after another (especially Hansen's, of course), but my absolute favourite is that harmony in 9:38 that fits with horror. More than outstanding , I give it 15/10!    I'm alive and Little Time are thrilling songs too.  I saw a cover brazilian band playing I'm alive on MTV.     The ones I like less ( in my scale), but still good:    A Tale that wasn't right is a ballad written by Michael Weikath. He peforms the solo ( good emotion given , I concluded after watching a concert from Pink Bubbles Go ape tour ).   It?s in Helloween?s set list frequently and was played in Rio de Janeiro, march 2006.  Future world is played every show and has a cheerful climate.Even Kai with his Gamma Ray play it in concert.    Follow the sign consists of solos did by Hansen followed by sentences spoken by him that gives the missions for the keeper of the 7 keys.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|While watching the film you don't realize how equally powerful the music is until you listen to the CD independent of the film. Listening to the CD gives me goose bumps.
0375422889|5.0|lovely book, highly recommended. Riveting personal story allows you to learn about recent history of Iran.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|I wasn't expecting much from this film.  The only reason I rented it was because I like Diane Lane so much.  Lane is by far one of the most underrated actresses in Hollywood.  There were points when the film was a little too saccharin, but I though it had a nice message and featured a great cast.  Along with Lane we have John Cusack (also greatly underrated), Christopher Plummer as Lane's horny, widower, Irish dad, Elizabeth Perkins as Lane's older sister, and West Wing's Stockard Channing as the woman after Lane's father.  The cast really worked well together and there were some real emotional as well as comedic moments in the film.  Granted, this film was not high art, but it is a fun little escapist film.  If you enjoy romantic comedies with a nice little message, then this is for you.
0780619951|3.0|THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is one of those really botched films that is so fascinating in its ineptitude, it's actually quite fun.  Marlon Brando who utilized short wave radio to help him remember his lines is in fine campy form as the mad Dr. Moreau who experiments with animals to make a perfect human being.  He is aided by the sadistic and nearly mad Val Kilmer, obviously having fun playing such a twisted role.  David Thewlis who hated the movie and refused to see the finished product looks appropriately befuddled as the sole survivor of an airplane crash that is brought to the island for his DNA--to prevent Brando's lovely daughter (Faizura Balk) from regressing into her feline stage.<br /><br />The makeup from wizard Stan Winston is pretty effective and the movie's \\"message\\" is clear:  man is already half animal.  While achieving status as sort of a camp classic, DR. MOREAU is a strange and guilty pleasure.
0671618601|4.0|It was good. Just wasn't long enough. I purchased the cassette when I should have purchased the book. I may consider the cd's next time. It was really good.
B00003CXB2|5.0|A classic, based on a true story.  Exceptionally well filmed, great performances.  Quite a long movie, but just set aside some extra time and settle down and enjoy!  One of the all-time greats.

B00005JO1Y|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />With this second remake of the 1933 classic, \\"King Kong,\\" director Peter Jackson seems to have forgotten the cardinal rule of the monster movie genre: keep it simple and keep it short.  What with a budget of $207 million and a running time of three hours and seven minutes, Jackson has turned what could have been a dynamic, tightly wound B-movie thriller into a turgid A-movie opus whose whole adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.  However - and this is a big however - some of those parts are so absolutely extraordinary that I find myself strongly recommending that people go see it despite any reservations I might have about the film overall.<br /><br />Most people are already familiar with the story of the unscrupulous and shamelessly self-promoting filmmaker in the 1930's who takes his cast and crew to a mysterious location called Skull Island to shoot his latest picture.  While there, they encounter a bizarre, prehistoric world ruled by a giant ape who takes a serious liking to the beautiful blonde starlet, Ann Darrow, who is offered up as a sacrifice to him by the terrified natives.  When the crew members are finally able to rescue her and subdue the beast, they take him back to New York where Carl Denham, the director, turns him into a lucrative freak-show attraction for the well-to-do in Manhattan.  But it's not all that easy to keep a feisty, 50-foot gorilla down when he's being mistreated, as the city seen learns to its everlasting regret.<br /><br />The film has been subconsciously divided up into three distinct sections of virtually equal length and utterly unequal quality.  The desultory first hour, with its tongue-in-cheek dialogue and its winking-at-the-camera performances, feels less like a remake and more like a parody of the original.  However, once the characters disembark onto the island, Jackson's skills as an action movie director come into play and he is able to generate some genuine excitement in the jungle scenes.  However, even here, repetitiveness and wretched excess become the order of the day as our intrepid little band of adventurers, who have gone in search of their kidnapped companion, do battle with one grisly creature after another.  In fact, the characters encounter so many dinosaurs in Kong's world that at one point we feel as if we've somehow wandered into the coming attractions trailer for \\"Jurassic Park IV.\\"<br /><br />But it is in the final third of the film that the elements really come together and the movie approaches something akin to greatness.  The scenes of Kong in New York have such a remarkable excitement and poignancy about them that they begin to clear away all the critical thoughts we might have had about the movie up to that point.  All the earlier build-up finally pays off as we see the bewildered beast tearing up a city, then falling under a hail of fatal bullets all for the sake of the woman he loves.  New York City itself has never looked better than it does in this movie, and the images of Kong standing atop the Empire State Building as planes circle menacingly around him are eye-popping and beautiful to behold.  Much of the credit for the emotional wallop in the film's final act goes to Naomi Watts whose lovely performance, coupled with the beautifully expressive face of the computer-generated Kong, convinces us that there is a genuine love and attraction between this beauty and this beast.  The nice thing about this section of the movie is that the special effects, spectacular and breathtaking as they are, are primarily there to serve the human interest aspect of the story, a rarity in any film in which FX play such a crucial part.  The other actors are considerably less effective in their roles, particularly Adrien Brody, whose stiff performance as Jack Driscoll, the writer and human love interest to Ann, is indicative of what a badly written role it is.  It's small wonder that her romance with the ape is more compelling and convincing than the one with Jack.  Jack Black gives a wildly uneven performance, but he does engage our interest occasionally so he deserves some credit for that.<br /><br />And, indeed, \\"uneven\\" is probably the operative word for this film.  Suffice it to say that you will really be seeing three movies in one here.  The first is tedious and dull, the second occasionally gripping but far too repetitious, and the third absolutely smashing and spectacular.  Given the quality of much of what Hollywood produces these days, one out of three ain't really all that bad.es a wildly uneven performance, but he does engage our interest occasionally so he deserves some credit for that.

B00005Q66T|5.0|I really dig Madonna. AS you might tell from my other reviews, I really dont like \\"POP\\" music, yet I have always had respect for Madonna. She has really changed the face of POP music over the years, and just being able to sell records for more then 20yrs derserves repect. I consider this her best collection of songs, even though most are mellow, I really like Madonna's softer side, yet I am impressed with her ablity to step into a more club/electronica type of sound. Her voice is really an instrument in itself, and her live shows are full of energy. This is a must for any music fan..ENJOY
0553804367|5.0|I listened to the audio version which is well produced and well read.         Book vs. CD the material is the same (the audio version has text illustrations available on the last disk).         Physics used to be a science that mere mortals such as you and I, could aspire too. Certainly you needed mathematical skill, but with hard work and a creative mind you could understand and study the physical world around you. This was the case until early in the 20th century when Relativity and Quantum theories arose. At this point the mathematics involved truly become difficult and esoteric to the point were only a relative handful of people proficient in such mathematics could understand and develop further theories. Additionally, as our knowledge expanded, sub-specialization in physics created a further segregation of the material where even only a smaller few could understood the nuance and intricacies of their specific field.          In this milieu of high math and super specialization what is the curious lay person to do?     Read Stephen Hawking!          In his casual manner and efficient eloquent prose, he presents the current status of physics and cosmology such that you and I can actually understand the principles and theories. I will never understand the derivation of the theories but as Hawking explains I don't need to, through this book we do not become PhD students, simply guests at his dinner table discussing what he is thinking. What great minds like Hawking are thinking is infinitely more interesting than most other topics which come up at the average dinner table.          Somehow just understanding what these giants are working on makes me comfortable in my relative ignorance, while I can never understand how they know, I can understand what they know.          When I read the A Brief History of Time in 1988 I felt the same way and must admit at that time worried that Dr. Hawking would not live much longer due to the severity of his illness. It is very comforting that he and his mind and his desire to include and share with us his intimate yet wonderful knowledge of physics. He is among the select few that have the skill to educate the masses in science. Hawking, Sagan and Feynman benefit mankind not only with their science but with their dedication to teaching humanity.         The brief bios on Einstein, Galileo and  Newton were an unexpected bonus.
B000002HMH|1.0|If there is one thing that I dont understand, its Metallica fans. I dont understand why a band who people couldnt stand in the 1980's, suddenly became everyones favorite band. Let me explain my theroy on this album and why I think that everyone's excuse of changing direction is a bunch of crap. Metallica actually began to change direction somewhat in 1988. When they released \\"And Justice for All\\" it would be Jason Newsteads first full length album with the band, and I am sure the pressure was on because he has some big shoes to fill with Cliff Burton passing away just a few yrs before. When And Justice came out, you could hear that there was a bit of difference from the other three albums. It wasnt that much slower then the other 3, but a bit more polished (for the time) and the songs seemed a bit more complex. It actually took me awhile to really appricate the album, as it just didnt really hit a nerve when I picked it up in 1988, Yet, after many listens, it grew on me, and I realized that the band was maturing and they were going to go in a bit of a diffrent musicaly direction. When the Black album came out in 1991, I really wasn't thrilled at all, and to this day, its not one of my favorites, yet...I would take it over the LOAD and RELOAD period any day of the week. Even though the Black album seemed more radio friendly, and the songs really slowed down, it still was Metal. And yes I like all music types, but you are what you are. Metallica was a great Metal band, when they decided to sell out for Load and REload, I lost all respect. This album is terrible. I love all music, it doesnt have to be thrash metal for me to enjoy it, yet when you want to go in a different direction, it doesnt mean changing your entire style of music to sell more albums...I mean lets take the Band Bolt Thrower for example..For those that arent familer with them, they are a death/doom Metal band out of England. The first two releases were lightning fast, I mean fast...Yet the newer material, (they have been around since 1988) has slowed down tremediously..YET, it is still heavy and it is still Metal. I dont understand LOAD, and maybe if it wasnt Metallica that did it, it might be a better album (it would have been much better if a band like Pearl Jam or Creed would have put something out like Load) Anyway, one more point I would like to make is that why do some many hate the new album. Everyone who said that they were experimenting with a new musical concept said it was alright during the Load period..YET when it comes to ST. Anger everyone is sooo disappointed with it...Its to noisy, Lousy production, Lars drums soound like Tin Cans...COMe on..First offf, I think St. ANger is a really good album. Its got some really crunchy riffs, and it seems like they are going back to their metal roots. Is it as good as RIde the Lightning..Hell no...but it shows that they cared more about the music then the money (hey the CD barley got any airplay) Think about what you say when you review....Do you really really like the old Metallica, do you really like Metal, or where you just infactuated with a sub-par rock album from a bunch of sellouts
0307276902|4.0|'Care about what people think of you and you will always be their prisoner'. This is just one line from Frey's memoir. I totally and completely beleieve everything that Frey has to say. I think that is why I connected with him and this book so much. James Frey thinks and feels the same way that I do about a lot of things. Whether the accusations are true or not, whether he embellished more than just a little, A Million Little Pieces is an extremely intense, gripping piece of writing and is definitely worth a chance.
B000000WCA|1.0|Let me tell you that the Spice Girls isn't music. It might fall into the Milli Villni catagory, but at least the two guys that were doing the vocals (not the guys pictured on the album) had some decent voices. Music is an expression! No matter what form, it comes from the heart. I believe that all muscians should write their own lyrics and should play thier own intruments. Lets take Hip-Hop. A lot of these performers today are just a creation of the music bizz. All they do is lay down their vocals over beats that someone else arranged. SOme dont even write their own lyrics..shame shame..Old school hip-hop was so much better. Even though most is sampled, most artist back in the day wrote their own lyrics, and put together their samples themselves, which shows CREATIVITY. All these poser girl and boy bands from this time period are lame. Most dont write their own music, and yes some do have some nice vocies, yet if you want a voice that sounds like an insturment, then seriously check out opera. Pavoritii has an amazing voice, and even though he might not write his own material (I am not sure if he does) his voice alone is the MUSIC. THis Spice Girls album is ridicuilous. Its weak and has no feel. People that give this 4 or 5 stars really need some musical history. (if you are under 12 yrs old, I can understand you might liking it..yet) if you arent...check out some of my other reviews for \\"Music\\" This CD isn't even worth sitting on my table as a coaster
B00005JNRE|5.0|My husband and I absolutely loved this movie.  We saw it on the date of release in a theatre packed with people of all ages and it was wonderful to see how much everyone, young and mature seemed to really enjoy it and most importantly were engaged with it from start to finish. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I was sad to read the first reviewer's notes on the movie \\"Mary Poppins with no magic\\", I think you read too much into it... movies are meant to entertain and once in a while a movie comes along that lets you walk away with a smile and a belief that no matter how bad a situation gets it can be resolved - no matter what it takes with or without magic the movie was lots of fun ! Don't miss this instant classic !!
B000002H2H|5.0|There are many agruements of what the best Metallica album was. I have to say that Ride the Lightning was easily their best effort, and might be one of the top 10 metal records ever made. Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10, and every single tune is heavy as hell (except for Call of the Katula, but it does some crunching at the end) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again. True the Master of Puppets is great to, but I dont think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning. Master has really been worn out since I listened to it soooo much, that it really doesnt do it for me anymore. I still love Ride the Lightning as they day I bought it in 1986. ENJOY!
B0009X766Y|5.0|\\"The sting\\" (1973) might be an old film, but I think it is sensible to say that, for all practical purposes, it is new for those who haven't watched it before. That was my case, and it might be yours  :)<br /><br />The story is set in the thirties, and it is nothing less than excellent, good enough to keep you at the edge of your sit. Hooker (Robert Redford) and Luther (Robert Earl Jones) are con artists that steal from the wrong person, a crook that works for a big time mobster, Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Lonnegan doesn't take that kindly, and sends his goons to kill the conmen. Luther dies, but Hooker survives, and from that moment onwards has only two purposes: stay alive, and take revenge. Of course, Hooker will not be alone, as he will have the help of Gondorff (Paul Newman), another con artist and one of Luther's old friends.<br /><br />All in all, I firmly believe that this film is a timeless classic you shouldn't miss. Directed by George Roy Hill and with a superb cast, \\"The sting\\" is the kind of movie that surprises you till the very end. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000002IRL|5.0|Horrorscope continues to be a great metal record, even since its release in 1991. This was the best Overkill line-up as far as I am concerned, with Sid Falack on Drums (the best drummer that they have had) Horrorscope is a very heavy album, and the Stand out track on this has to be Nice day for A Funeral. Overkill has never really broke into the mainstream, and they arent that well known by newer metal heads, considering their heyday was in the late 1980's. This is a must to have for all fans of Metal, even NU-Metal. Enjoy this one..It smokes
B0000TLA9G|4.0|I am not a fan of Guns N'Roses, and I certainly don't have the previous albums of this band. Notwithstanding that, a friend recommended me this cd, and I bought it. After all, it wasn't too expensive, and I didn't have much to lose  :)<br /><br />Right now I'm quite thankful that I followed her advice and bought this album. Truth to be told, I realized that I like this band more than I thought. My favorites songs are \\"Paradise City\\", \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\",\\"You Could Be Mine\\", \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\", \\"November Rain\\", and \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", but there are many more that you are likely to enjoy.<br /><br />All in all, recommended, specially for those that aren't Guns N'Roses fans but want to learn what that band was about.<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000002HRE|2.0|To all who read my review on \\"Load\\", this is pretty much going to be the same thing, yet as much as I hate the Load Period, there are some songs here that show that Metallica was starting to get a bit back into the metal genere. Even though RE_Load is pretty much all the material they didnt release for Load, I think it wasnt releaed because of the fact that some of the material is a bit heavier. The Memory remains is a pretty good tune, very strange, and Fuel kicks some a**. There is still alot of filller material on this album, but I was so hoping that after this, they would be stepping it up again. Unfortantly, they gave us Garage Days, with some lousy cover songs on it...The only good thing about it was that it contained the $5.98 EP, Garage Days RE-Revisted, which in my mind is one of the best things they did. Covering some old hardcore and punk tunes, and putting them in Metallica Style...BRILLENT..We would have to wait awhile to get back to the hard stuff with the release of ST. Anger. Oh, to the moron reviewer from Texas, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, AND IT DOESNT SUPRISE ME THAT YOU LIKE LOAD. YOU SAY THAT THEY ARE DONE WITH TRASH, SO GET OVER IT. WHAT DO YOU CALL ST. ANGER?? IS IT CLASSIFIED AS THRASH, NO BUT ITS HEAVY AND SOME SONGS ARE PRETTY DAMN FAST, SO WHEN YOU ARE DONE READING YOU HARRY POTER BOOK, GO OUT TO THE CD STORE AND PICK UP A COPY OF ST. ANGER..DONT HURT YOURSELF
0452282152|5.0|This book kept me reading and reading and reading.  I got lost in the story and was so sad to see it end!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say? Joss and his team are story-tellin' gods! The casting choices they made were inspired. My only disappointment ... series interruptus. One season.... even with a really nifty movie, Serenity, to fill in the gaps... it's just not enough. Only thing that keeps me from going completely insane at the idea of there never being another Firefly episode is.... I know Joss will come up with something amazing, and I know he'll use many of his favorite actors, and mine, when he does. I just HATE waiting for it...
B000BGH22W|5.0|The soundtrack is great! The music transports you to Hogwarts! If you play the music and read the book at the same time, it is really superb.
1563890410|5.0|Guard your nipples against the corpse-ified bullies of yore: that's what I learned! No, seriously this is an AMAZING book. As if one twist in the middle of the book(after some well-built suspense) wasn't enough to make the story seem grandiose, another twist near the end comes along and makes it epic.<br /><br />We return to an old character in this volume(which is genius, of course; cliffhangers SUCK!!) and meet a new one. The best thing is, you sympathize with ALL gaiman's characters(even the mischevious ones). And more references to mythology and even art are thrown in, as expected (watch Susano-o-makoto's expressions and poses).<br /><br />Excellent volume, Mr. Gaiman! I'll get 5 on my next paycheck, but for now I'm working on American Gods!! :)
B0009X75RO|4.0|2002's Chicago was a box office smash and signaled the return of movie musicals, along with Moulin Rouge a year before, and The Phantom Of The Opera, Rent, and The Producers since. Winner of 6 Oscars, including Best Picture, its initial DVD treatment was not one worthy of a Best Picture Oscar-winner. Featuring a making-of featurette, an audio commentary, and a deleted musical number, Class, the DVD definitely needed work. <br /> <br />2005 saw the announcement of a deluxe 3-disc DVD of the movie, called The Razzle Dazzle Edition. However, sometime in the year, the release was pushed back from September to December, and the third disc, containing the soundtrack in 5.1 Digital Surround, was dropped. However, the 2-disc treatment still finally gives this movie a deserving, if not perfect, DVD treatment. <br /> <br />The transfer itself is good, but it's a bit grainy. For a new movie, which likely has pristine digital sources for video, the transfer shouldn't be as grainy as it is. The grain isn't heavy, but it's still slightly noticeable. Despite that, the transfer was very well done. Disc 1 also contains the Class number, which although is great, would not have worked within the film's concept of everything being through Roxie's point of view. Also, a feature on the plays, Broadway show, and its eventual translation to the big screen, and an audio commentary round out disc 1. <br /> <br />Disc 2 contains lots of amazing bonuses. Extended musical performances, featurettes on the crew, a feature on when Liza Minelli played Roxie Hart, a feature on the cameo appearance by Chita Rivera, Broadway's original Velma Kelly, and VH1's Behind The Movie are included on here. My only real beef is the VH1 special. It would have been nice for them to make a new, longer, more in-depth making-of documentary that also covered the Oscar wins, as the VH1 special was aired after the nominations were announced, but before the ceremony. Also, a theatrical trailer or two would have been nice. I will never understand why these are omitted from DVDs, as trailers are almost always readily available, and were once one of the few features, if not THE only feature on DVDs. <br /> <br />Despite a few gripes, I heartily recommend this DVD. If you own the previous DVD, sell it or give it to someone who doesn't care about bonus features and pick this new edition up. If you don't own it already, what are you waiting for?!
B000063DHL|4.0|this is by far one of maidens best!very high energy playing,and extremly powerful vocals!this is how metal should be done!its refreshing to listen to musicians who truly know how to play there instruments.Adrian smith is an amazing guitarist/its kinda funny they now have 3 guitarist!anyway go out and get this!UP THE IRONS!
B0013ND30M|5.0|I won't waste your time discussing the movie, it's gorgeous graphic design, and the beautiful music, adapted from Tchaikovsky's ballet. If you're a fan, you already know this. If you've not yet discovered the movie, you'll read more about it from others. Note: This is a review of the DVD edition. I don't own a high definition TV or a Blu-Ray player, so I haven't bothered to buy the Blu-Ray edition.    Sleeping Beauty was first released to DVD in region 1 in the fall of 2003, although it had already been released in other parts of the world. This release utilized a 1990's digital restoration that was absolutely gorgeous and presented the film in both its original widescreen Cinemascope aspect ratio and pan-and-scan fullscreen. It also included a disc full of bonus materials, such as the 15-minute making-of featurette from the 1997 VHS and laserdisc editions, other short making-of featurettes, a widescreen-to-fullscreen comparison, and several short films such as Grand Canyon, the live-action Cinemascope short that accompanied Sleeping Beauty in its original 1950 theatrical release. For a non-Platinum Edition, Sleeping Beauty's first DVD release was definitely one worthy of a Disney classic. However, its release window was very short and it was vaulted just five months after its DVD debut.    Now, Sleeping Beauty has been taken out of the Disney vault and given a sparkling new DVD treatment, starting with the main feature itself. Sleeping Beauty was the second film in history to be given a full extensive digital restoration, and those efforts resulted in what I still consider to be one of the finest DVD transfers ever made. However, this new restoration blows the 2003 DVD's transfer away. The colors are warmer and more pleasing this time. The clarity is outstanding and all of the patterns and textures feel almost as if you could touch it.    Disney has been advertising this as a never-before-seen expanded version of the film, and they're right. Now, anyone who's seenit in a theater or on a widescreen home video release knows the film has always been wide, and therefore knows the expansion shown on the packaging and in commercials is a little exaggerated. However, previous widescreen versions used the Cinemascope master, which cropped a bit off all four sides of the images. Sleeping Beauty, however, was filmed in and designed for 70MM Technirama. However, once a soundtrack is added to a theatrical print, you STILL didn't see all of the full Technirama negative. This new DVD and Blu-Ray edition is the first ever home video version to utilize the complete Technirama negative. Although you won't always notice the difference, there's some scenes where you see things you never EVER saw in previous home video releases. In a film that places so much emphasis on the artwork, this is quite a revelation. This DVD, unlike the previous one, does NOT include a pan-and-scan version. Personally, I'm not very upset over this, as Sleeping Beauty should only be seen in its full Technirama splendor.    In addition, the audio transfer is absolutely flawless, but the last DVD, as well as the soundtrack CD, which has also seen a [[ASIN:B001DXF9FE new release]] to coincide with the Platinum Edition DVD/Blu-Ray, also had amazing sound quality - very vibrant and full with complete clarity. I've heard recordings made AFTER this soundtrack was recorded that don't sound this good. Sleeping Beauty was not the first stereo album, nor was it the first film to have stereo sound, but it was the first time the music element itself had ever been recorded in multi-channel stereo, and therefore became the world's first stereo soundtrack album. This time, the DVD also includes the restored original 4-channel soundtrack as well. This one sounds a little less full, but its inclusion in here for posterity's sake is still to be commended. I've also heard that the 7.1 soundtrack from the Blu-Ray is also absolutely incredible.    The bonus features on this new set are, for the most part, far better than those from the previous DVD, with one exception, which I'll get to in a bit.    First and foremost, the audio commentary from the original DVD is gone and replaced with a new one, although clips from the old one are said to be included. I have yet to listen to the new commentary, so I can't say anything. The old commentary included two deleted song demos, but since these are included on disc 2 as separate bonus features, this really probably isn't missed. Nonetheless, it's a good reason to hang onto your 2003 DVD. Another good reason will be coming up soon.    Secondly, gone is the fluffy 15-minute EPK featurette from the movie's 1997 home video releases, plus other various small featurettes obviously taken from interviews for the 15-minute piece. While all of it was informative and better than no behind-the-scenes stuff at all, it left one wanting more. Well, Disney's giving us more now with a fairly meaty 45-minute documentary, Picture Perfect: The Making Of Sleeping Beauty. This one really delves into the history of Disney's film adaptation, as well as the groundbreaking achievements accomplished in the film. The only EPK spin-off featurette from the 2003 DVD one might miss is the Restoration featurette, but since it advertised how the master for the 1997 video and the 2003 video releases was done, it's not too logical here, but it was nicely informative on how digital restoration is done in general.    Disney includes the Cinemascope-filmed short film that accompanied the film on its original release, Grand Canyon, as well as the Disneyland episode promoting the film, The Peter Tchaikovsky Story. Although these were included on the 2003 DVD release, these are not merely ported over from that release. Grand Canyon was ported over onto the 2003 DVD from Sleeping Beauty's special edition laserdisc box set's non-anamorphic masters, meaning it was a letterboxed 4:3 image. This time, the film has been beautifully restored and is presented letterboxed in a 16:9 frame. In addition, The Peter Tchaikovsky Story is presented in its complete television versions. One version explains to the viewer how to use their radios and TVs to be able to view the program in 3-channel stereo sound and was shown in markets with participating radio stations broadcasting the audio. The second version, shown in non-participating markets, had different narration during that segment. Both versions, however, included TV's first ever widescreen presentations, albeit still slightly cropped on the sides, when they previewed clips of Sleeping Beauty.    New featurettes on Eyvind Earle and Aurora's walk through the forest, called Sequence 8, are also included, as are live-action reference footage - some of which was ported over from the 2003 release, some of which is new to the set - and the short film Four Artists Paint One Tree - also ported from the 2003 release, albeit from what I hear, a new transfer was made. Also included is an alternate opening with a new recording of the deleted song Holiday, as well as three deleted songs - It Happens I Have A Picture, presented as both a newly recorded song and in a spoken word version, as well as the two demos from the 2003 DVD's commentary - Riddle Diddle and Go To Sleep. All are presented with storyboards with the exception of Go To Sleep, which is actually married to the scene of the film it would have appeared in.    The most exciting new bonus, however, is the recreation of the original Sleeping Beauty Castle attraction at Disneyland. Bonus features of this type have been included on The Little Mermaid Platinum Edition DVD, which offered a virtual ride based on the abandoned Disneyworld ride, and the recent 2-Disc Nightmare Before Christmas DVD, where film of the Christmastime revamp of the Haunted Mansion was presented. This time, the viewer gets the chance to view an attraction that hasn't been seen in three decades. You can see the attraction straight-through, in a presentation that allows you to see the windows up close and get more information on how they were originally created, and a behind-the-scenes featurette on the making and history of the attraction. When any of the presentations are over and it goes back to this bonus feature's main menu, you'll see a little something highlighted. Select it and you can see still images of the pages from the souvenir book given to visitors of the attraction at the end.    The only bonus feature not completely ported over from the previous DVD are the art galleries. In some areas, it gains images, but in some it loses them. However, it's presented in the same format as galleries from all of the post-Beauty and the Beast Platinum Edition DVDs. Also, audio commentary has been dropped from all images. I personally preferred the art gallery in a castle format of the 2003 DVD's galleries as well as the audio commentary on select images, which is another reason I'll be hanging onto my 2003 DVD as well.    Despite what's been left off from the 2003 release, this new 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Sleeping Beauty STILL blows that DVD away because of what IS here, as well as the spectacular audio and video presentation. Without a doubt it is the best home video version ever for this fantastic movie. All fans of this movie MUST own this new DVD edition. If you happen to own the 2003 DVD, you still must upgrade to this new Platinum Edition DVD, but I'd still hang onto the original DVD for the fullscreen version, (In case you ever had to show this to someone who *gag* hates widescreen.) the original audio commentary, and the original photo galleries. Disney's first Platinum Edition of a previously-strong DVD release, based on some past downgrades, could have been a complete disaster. Instead, it's a vast improvement and I can't praise this set enough.
0385507755|5.0|If this book had been classified as fiction, or as \\"events as recalled by the author,\\" no one would be upset.  Get over it.  Realize that the important thing is the message in the book.  Thanks, Mr. Frey, and keep writing.  You are a good writer.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Yes, I know, Audrey Hepburn couldn't sing the songs and had to have someone else sing for her, while Julie Andrews could have done the singing herself. I know all that. However, I think Audrey Hepburn and Marni Nixon did a fine job acting and singing as Eliza Doolittle. Audrey is my favorite actress of all time, so I'm a bit biased, but I'm also a huge fan of Julie and I know she would have done this role brilliantly. However, she went on to do Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music, and honestly, I can't see anyone else as Mary or Maria. Just wanted to get all that out of the way, as many can't get past the fact that Julie wasn't in the movie. <br /> <br />That having been said, I discovered My Fair Lady in the mid-90's, after a team of experts lovingly restored the film to its original Super Panavision 70 splendor, although for years, I still only saw the pan-and-scan version. However, I instantly fell in love with the songs, the designs, and the lovely Ms. Hepburn. <br /> <br />This DVD is absolutely one of the crown jewels of my collection. The transfer is excellent, although I hear it starts to break down on large screen TVs, HDTVs, and projection screens. However, I just have a regular TV, and on my TV, it's an excellent transfer. The colors are vibrant, the designs are brilliant, the scope of the Super Panavision 70 fills my eyes with visual beauty. There are a few print flaws which are present because of the inability to perfectly fix them in 1994, but nothing very distracting. The audio is also excellent. The first disc's sole bonus feature is an audio commentary by production designer Gene Allen, Marni Nixon, and restorers Robert Harris and James Katz. I found the commentary to be a bit boring, and focused more on the restoration than anything else. All in all, the movie is the showpiece of disc 1. Although many can argue that it could use a new digital restoration by companies such as Lowry Digital, responsible for many of the restorations of Disney films for DVD, to bring it to the standard of movies restored in the 21st century, I think the 1994 restoration still holds up beautifully 10 years later. <br /> <br />Disc 2 contains a plethora of features. Although I can gripe about the time counter at the top of some of these, or about the lack of some other bonuses that were included on the deluxe LD box set from 1994, but I won't. <br /> <br />The meat of the bonuses lies in the 1994 making-of documentary \\"More Loverly Than Ever.\\" The documentary goes in-depth into the making AND restoration of the movie. The documentary includes interviews (some archival) for cast, crew, Marni Nixon, and even Julie Andrews. Also included are vintage featurettes, archival premiere footage, trailers, and galleries. Also included are clips of \\"Show Me\\" and \\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\" including Audrey Hepburn's original singing vocals. Although she did a good job on Loverly, (despite needing Nixon to sing the final lines) hearing Audrey's vocals on Show Me shows that having Nixon sing the songs probably was a better idea than having Audrey sing the songs herself, despite the fact that she tried. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of this movie, or of movie musicals in general, I heartily recommend this beautiful DVD set. If you have a regular TV set, you won't notice any issues in the transfer, and the bonus features delve into the making of the movie. You can't ask for a better DVD edition of My Fair Lady than this.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Man, is this awesome music.  In fact, I'm tempted to say that it's the greatest score that's ever been written for a movie.  and that's coming from a diehard John Williams fan. <br /> <br />But you know the music's great.  Just go ahead and buy it.  It's worth whatever you pay. <br /> <br />There are a few quibbles from me, however.  The big one: as much as I love to have the various bits of non-Shore music (Gandalf's rendition of \\"The Road Goes Ever On,\\" for example, and the infectious Hobbit party music entitled \\"Flaming Red Hair\\"), I'd MUCH MUCH MUCH rather they had been set off as separate tracks.  There are several of these pieces, and they are almost all dropped right into the middle of score pieces.  In one or two cases, they even play over the score!  This creates an off-putting sense of dislocation in an otherwise seamless score. <br /> <br />I'm also not fond of the booklet.  It's great on its own -- a scholarly study of the various themes introduced by Shore in the score -- but it's written from a music-academic point of view, and that makes it rather difficult to keep up with for laypeople like myself.  It's informative, but it ought to have supplemented by a more traditional track-by-track explanation for people who do not possess music degrees. <br /> <br />And whereas the overall packaging is lovely, I definitely agree with other reviewers who have noted how shoddy the placeholder for the DVD is.  It's just a piece of rubber that threatens to come off if you take the DVD out more than two or three times!  I've just put mine in a spare DVD case along with my DVDs.  The DVD itself, by the way, is gloriously good. <br /> <br />These are serious complaints, but they do nothing to detract from how deeply excellent this music is.  I eagerly await the boxes for the other two movies.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|In the mid 90's, Disney released a lavish laserdisc box set of Alice In Wonderland, which included all kinds of bonus materials, song demos, radio programs, galleries, and more. Much of that material has made it onto this new wonderful DVD treatment of Alice In Wonderland, but it's disappointing to know what was left off. But first, some words on what IS on the DVD.    The centerpiece is a new beautifully restored and remastered transfer of the movie. All previous VHS and DVD releases pale in comparison to this DVD's gorgeous transfer. Colors pop out, the image is clean, clear, sharp, and pristine. It's been given the same care as many of their more popular films.    Disc 1 contains the Mickey Mouse cartoon \\"Thru The Mirror,\\" sing-alongs, a Virtual Wonderland Party, and a great deleted song titled \\"I'm Odd.\\"    Disc 2 contains the real meat. The 1950 TV special \\"One Hour In Wonderland\\" is presented complete with Coca Cola advertisements. It's a wonderful nostalgic look at classic TV. Other TV excerpts are included, as well as the \\"Operation Wonderland\\" theatrical featurette, trailers, the 1920's \\"Alice's Wonderland\\" short, galleries, and deleted songs.    However, a lot of material from the LD box set has been left off of this DVD release:  History  * The History of Alice in Wonderland  * Sir John Tenniel's Illustrations for the Lewis Carroll books  * 1939 Storyboards for Unproduced Feature Version (Artwork by David Hall and Ray Jacobs)  * 1943 Storyboards for Unproduced Feature Version  * Final Sequence Breakdown    Song Demos  * The Caucus Race  * I'm Late (Song Demo)  * I'm Late (Test)  * The Unbirthday Song  * \\"Tea Party\\" Dialogue  * Alice in Wonderland  * In a World of My Own (Piano Instrumental)  * In a World of My Own (Song Demo)  * The Jabberwocky Song  * Twas Brillig (Piano Instrumental)  * The Walrus and the Carpenter Part 1 (Version #2)  * The Walrus and the Carpenter Part 2 (Version #1)  * The Walrus and the Carpenter Part 2 (Version #2)  * The Walrus and the Carpenter Part 3 (Version #1)  * Garden of Live Flowers Dialogue Sequence  * Rose Garden Scene  * How Doth the Little Crocodile  * Paul Frees Audition: Dodo Bird  * Paul Frees Audition: White Rabbit #1  * Paul Frees Audition: White Rabbit #2  * The Lion and the Unicorn  * Instrumental Demo  * \\"Dance\\" Instrumental Demo  * \\"Entrance of the Walrus and the Carpenter\\" Instrumental Demo  * Alice and the Cheshire Cat  * Gavotte of the Cards  * Mock Turle Soup Song  * Humpty Dumpty  * Entrance of the Executioner  * When the Wind is in the East  * Braham's Lullabye Kathryn Beaumont Test  * The Carpenter is Sleeping  * Speak Roughly to Your Little Boy  * Will You Join the Dance  * Finale    Galleries  * Character Design: Miscellaneous Characters  * Character Design: Deleted Characters  * Main Title Designs  * Photo Gallery: Live-Action Reference Filming  * Voice Talent    Publicity  * Lobby Cards  * Press Book    * \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" BBC Radio Broadcast of July 4, 1951.  One Hour radio dramatization with Walt Disney and Kathryn Beaumont.    * BBC Christmas Radio Broadcast (1951)  Pre-recorded in California for broadcast by the BBC at Christmastime in 1951, this show features Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of Alice) and Walt Disney, who also provides the voice of Mickey Mouse. It was recorded as separate segments that introduced songs from classic Disney movies. The material included for presentation here (the segments setting up the songs) is all that's known to survive of this show.    Disney's omission of these features is unfortunate. However, what has been included is a wonderful look at the making of the film, and the film is presented beautifully. I still recommend this DVD for fans of the film.    EDIT: This DVD has been locked up in the Disney Vault as of January 31, 2008, so make sure to pick it up while you still can. Currently, Disney has not announced a re-release, and based on Disney's past history of putting 2-Disc sets in the vault in favor of overly fluffy single-disc reissues, I can't currently predict whether we're in for an improved 2-Disc set or a light and fluffy single-disc reissue along the veins of Tarzan's \\"Special Edition\\" DVD and the recent reissues of titles like Robin Hood and The Aristocats. Not to mention the rumor about Disney adding Alice to the Platinum Edition line. However, when a DVD of a Disney catalogue title like Alice goes into the vault, it's almost always because of an upcoming reissue, so it shouldn't be unavailable for long. I'll post more updates and details as I get them. Hopefully they're planning a new 2-Disc set with a making-of documentary and some of those missing special edition laserdisc bonus materials.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|It's not that the music isn't as punishing and unique as prior Korn outings, but it seems that with each new Korn album that's released, the more and more their song structure breaks down.

0441172717|5.0|Frank Herbert has created one of the best sci-fi epics ever.I'm not going to go right a book report on this but take my word, this is beyond excellent.The story will suck you in and won't let you go until the last page.The characters are well written too.My only complaint is that I disagree with some of the pholosipies not only in this book but through out  the whole series.If you are just getting into sci-fi or just want to read a good book, go get this one.After you are done pick up the next one and the others in the series.You will not be dissapointed.
B0000AMJEH|1.0|One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed!
B0002KVUKM|5.0|2004 best action film.A fast paced roller coaster ride film that has everything since the Indiana Jones films.Hugh Jackman is perfect as van Helsing a tough no nonsence vampire hunter. Kate Bekinsale(who played a vampire in Underworld)is after Dracula and his 3 brides in this film.What a team these two make in this film. The special efects are a sight to see. The plot line has been posted numurous times,so I wont repeat it.If you havent seen this great film check it out, its a dandy, the three female vampires flying around in a full frontal attack on the village early in the film is worth the price of the DVD alone.The movie is 135 minutes long, but every minute is of it is great. With all the junk that hollywood pumped out last year, this ones a rarity indeed.
0385512104|3.0|I'm the father of a 6-year-old with autism. I've often thought I'd do anything to crawl inside his head and see the world as he does for a little while. Mark Haddon's book provides a glimpse into the mind of someone with Asperger's Syndrome, a high-functioning form of Autism. It's a story about a child with autism trying to navigate and make sense of his world. While the main character is probably overly stereotyped, the insight into his world may be worthwhile if you have a friend or family member with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. <br /> <br />I'm hesitant to endorse this book because the pointless profanity was almost overwhelming. I don't consider myself overly sensitive to profanity. (I lived in an athletic dorm for 4 years in college.) But why did the author find it necessary to sprinkle the \\"F\\" word so liberally throughout the book? Is it just the author's lack of maturity? Whatever the reason, it was pointless and I think the language has probably kept some people from recommending this book to friends. <br /> <br />The bottom line is this. I think it's a probably worth wading through the author's potty mouth if you'd like to catch a glimpse of what it may be like to see the world as a person with autism (albeit stereotyped). Finally, a note to the author: Thank you for your efforts with this book, but dude, wash your mouth out! You should be embarrassed. Did your mom teach you to talk like that? <br />
B00003CX97|5.0|This is a masterpiece by almost any measure.  It achieves the highest level of the motion picture art form in terms of cinematography, acting, and musical scoring.  The storyline carries itself, keeping the audience glued to the screen as the plot unfolds.  The standoff between the Japanese and British colonels is especially memorable.  I've read that the Producer (Sam Spiegel) and the Director (David Lean) spared no expense and were uncompromising in the making of this film.  It shows.  The results are superb. <br /> <br />The only negative thing I can say is that, if you're looking for a happy ending, you might be disappointed.  The supplementary material on the DVD is excellent, especially the \\"Appreciation\\" by John Milius.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|This set is awesome and a must have for any Batman movie fan. You have the Great (Batman), the Good (Batman Returns), the Decent (Batman Forever), and the Ugly (Batman and Robin.) All four films have brand new digital transfers and remastered DD 5.1 surround sound in addition to an excellent DTS mix as well. The special features are all great, especially the 5 part documentary \\"The Shadow of the Batman\\" which is featured on each disc. Some also feature many of the music videos from the respective soundtracks from artists such as Prince, Smashing Pumpkins, Jewel and many others.<br /><br />I highly recommend this set to everyone!!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|This review contains spoilers.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard sci-fi fan that never watched Firefly, you might not like this movie. If you're a die-hard Firefly fan that's a purist about details, you might not like this movie.<br /><br />I read some of the 1-star reviews and I read some of the 5-star reviews. In both cases, I think people were a little too harsh on a movie that's very entertaining.<br /><br />For the Firefly fans, there were a few things that were inconsistent with the series, but in my opinion, they weren't major enough to detract from the entertainment value of the movie.<br /><br />The dialogue was just as quick-witted and sharp as it was on the series. The action and non-action scenes were balanced. I was not once bored during the film. While the deaths were heart-breaking and hard to bear, I understood why Joss wrote them in that way.<br /><br />I took both my mother and my girlfriend in to see this film in the theater. They both have rewatched it on DVD at least once, and now my girlfriend is watching the series because she liked the movie so much. I think if you go into this with an open mind, you will enjoy it for what it is--entertainment.<br /><br />Bonus Points on the DVD:<br /><br />-Hilarious outtakes<br /><br />-A good selection of deleted scenes.<br /><br />-Interesting featurettes.<br /><br />-An easter egg: the making of the Fruity Oaty Bar commercial along with the full-length commercial.
0793518326|4.0|This book is very very very complete and is good for anyone who can read music at and intermediate level.  The only bad thing i would have to say is that everything is written really small so you have to strain your eyes to see it and turning pages frequently because there is so much info on each page.  Unless you photocopy it larger like i have but other then that its great and well worth the money for anyone whos a fan.
0670033375|5.0|Reading the collapse of civilization literature over the years it is easy to forget that not every society has made catastrophic blunders.  While it certainly seems that the list of failures is a lot longer than that of the successes, one of the joys of Diamond's latest book is that he discusses some of these success stories at considerable length, pointing out in particular where human choice and not just blind luck made the difference.  Even some that ultimately failed, like the Norse colony in Greenland that survived for 450 years, demonstrate that a tough people led by strong leaders can cope with adversity, even extreme adversity for a very long time. <br /> <br />Diamond also shows clearly that poor leadership and greed by the ruling elite consistently results in disaster.  The chiefs of Easter Island, the ancient Maya kings, and more recently the long, sorry list of corrupt rulers in Haiti, Rwanda, and other Third World countries are examples.  These contrast with Japanese rulers during the Tokugawa era who made sure that all the forests were not cut down, even if their subjects had to adopt more sustainable diets, and with more or less democratically elected leaders like Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic who also saw to it that his country's forests were not stripped bare leaving it a Haiti-like wasteland. <br /> <br />Although Diamond's study would have been improved by more careful editing, a point made by other reviewers, he makes up for some excessively detailed accounts with excellent and cogent summaries.  I believe `Collapse' is actually better than his Pulitzer prize winning `Guns, Germs and Steel'.  In that book he sets out to disprove the idea that racial superiority somehow accounts for the political and economic success of Western countries compared to those of the Third World.    <br /> <br />To my way of thinking that is a straw man.  Few people well read in world history and economics hold such a view today.  The historical record does however show clearly that certain cultural values, combined with geography and natural resources, do indeed play a decisive role in determining societal winners and losers.  (See my review of `The Wealth and Poverty of Nations' by David Landes). <br /> <br />The harsh reality, as Diamond clearly shows, is that one way or another the collapse of most societies over the centuries has been tied to too many people producing too little food - the Law of Malthus.  Sometimes the food shortage is caused by natural causes, e.g. sudden climate change like a severe and prolonged drought.  Other times it is either caused or exacerbated by human negligence, such as prolonged slash and burn practices in fragile jungle rainforests or overgrazing by human introduced and managed flocks of sheep and cattle.   <br /> <br />The uplifting, even inspiring part of `Collapse' is Diamond's description of how even isolated, primitive people could figure out how to beat Malthus' Law.  The population of tiny Tikopia Island in the South Pacific has stayed at about 1,200 over 3,000 years because very early on its inhabitants realized that they would have to limit their population growth or die of starvation. <br /> <br />Other groups such as the Inuit of northern Canada and Greenland and the Pueblo in the Southwest U.S. have successfully overcome environmental challenges for hundreds, even thousands of years. Even the communist Chinese, after a series of disastrous economic decisions in the 1960s and 70s, finally decided that population growth would have to be curtailed if China and its people were to survive.  While we may lament such policies as forced abortion, looked at from the vantage point of the Chinese leadership trying to bring sweeping but necessary social change to a largely backward rural nation of a billion people, it is hard to see how anything but strict enforcement of the one child per family policy would  have any hope of success. <br /> <br />It is clear from Diamond's analysis that control of population growth and hence consumption of scarce resources (most importantly food, energy, and water) is the single most important factor in a society's avoidance of collapse.  Controlling population growth and conserving vital resources can only be achieved by wise and effective political leadership, whether from the bottom up or top down.  These are the lessons to be taken from a very fine and enlightening book.   Whether our present civilization can heed the warning signs of collapse is another matter.  Failure to do so is likely to result in a future world vividly and disturbingly described by James Howard Kunstler in `The Long Emergency'.   Along with `The Collapse of Complex Societies' by Joseph Tainter these books constitute a trilogy of must read books about the impending crisis facing our species on this little blue planet.  It may be tiny and obscure in the grand scheme of things but it's all we've got.
0743201140|4.0|A very enlightening book (though I think the way the publisher forces each reader to buy a new book in order to use the very specialized online survey is somewhat annoying) that is surprisingly accurate (at least I found it so) at identifying the reader/participant's strengths. I felt quite elated after reading much of the book and taking the test, but I feel that the book fails in providing a substantial methodology that one can follow to take advantage of the strengths their online survey identifies. Probably would be a great book used in conjuntion with a workshop or seminar where a human facilitator could walk you through the steps of planning your follow-through.
B00005JOII|4.0|While it's true that Woody Allen has had an erratic record as a filmmaker of late, there are definite pleasures to be had from his recent work such as 1999's \\"Sweet and Lowdown\\", 2000's \\"Small Time Crooks\\" and 2005's \\"Melinda and Melinda\\". However, what makes 2005's \\"Match Point\\" different from the usual Allen product is that it is an incessantly addictive film ripe with melodrama and suspense with little of Allen's angst-driven comedy. There are elements that will remind long-time Allen aficionados of 1989's \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" and 1993's \\"Manhattan Murder Mystery\\", but at the same time, the film seems also inspired by Anthony Minghella's 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", George Stevens's 1951 \\"A Place in the Sun\\" based on Theodore Dreiser's \\"An American Tragedy\\", and Adrian Lyne's 1987 \\"Fatal Attraction\\".<br /><br />Set in contemporary London, a first for Allen, the intricate plot focuses on a failed pro tennis player, Chris Wilton, who lands a rather cushy job as a coach at a fancy private club. Through sheer luck - a consistent theme throughout for Chris - he befriends wealthy Tom Hewett and by way of an evening in the family's opera box, begins dating his guileless sister Chloe. Insinuating himself into the family with ease, including securing a nice job at one of the companies owned by Tom and Chloe's father, Chris becomes obsessed with Nola Rice, Tom's seductive American fianc&eacute;e, a failing actress of whom Tom and Chloe's mother vehemently disapproves. How they all intertwine is what makes up most of the action, and the story works like an ever-tightening noose around Chris's actions. Even though it plays out like a smart thriller, Allen brings a decidedly fatalistic tone that introduces greater issues of fate, retribution and justice. The themes don't weigh the film down unnecessarily, and in fact, the film's last half-hour brings all the higher-level issues together in a way that makes the conclusion resonate with unpredictable force.<br /><br />As Chris, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers brings an effectively opaque manner to his character that makes him neither sympathetic nor villainous but rather leaves him precariously off-balance to the viewer. It's a smartly rendered performance that teeters toward the predictable only toward the very end. Although her first scene at the ping-pong table seems a bit excessive in introducing her character, Scarlett Johansson plays Nola with sensual fervor and palpable emotionalism, especially as her character spirals into darker psychological territory. Their scenes together are surprisingly carnal for an Allen film. Since they carry out the greater themes of moral vacuity, the remaining actors seem to be there simply to support the other end of the spectrum though not in predictable ways. For example, Emily Mortimer manages to play the unsuspecting Chloe not as a victim but as someone unwilling to confront her own unhappiness given her aggressive and rather selfish desire to become pregnant.<br /><br />As embodied expertly by Brian Cox as the overly generous father, Penelope Wilton as the overbearing mother and Matthew Goode as carefree Tom, the rest of the Hewett family are equally clueless about what is going on around them. However, that's exactly Allen's point in his parable-like script as he makes shrewd observations about the power of luck and our profound inability to control our destinies in making one's way toward a desired life. In a manner that recalls Gordon Willis's work in Allen's \\"Interiors\\", Remi Adefarasin lends an immaculately cool sheen to the cinematography, and the upscale world among the London social elite is captured almost too adroitly with Jim Clay`s manicured production design and Caroline Smith's tasteful set decorations. In place of his usual jazz-infused soundtrack, Allen uses old opera recordings of Caruso singing Bizet, Donizetti, Rossini and especially Verdi as a smartly evocative background. This is strong work from the film auteur side of Allen well worth viewing.n well worth viewing.
B000654OUG|5.0|Mitsuko Uchida is one of the major stars of the piano keyboard today and while her repertoire is wide, her interpretation of Franz Schubert's piano music is among the finest both on the concert stage and on recording.  The two seem to be from the same soul: Uchida somehow finds the spiritual core of Schubert and traverses the hurdles of his Olympian pieces with complete ease and assurance.<br /><br />This 8 CD set includes three sets of Impromptus (D899, 935, 946), Moments musicaux D780, German Dances D 820 an D790, and the Piano Sonatas numbers 4, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21.  The placing of these works on the individual CDs creates a series of eight recitals and each disc is rich and satisfying.  Playing all eight CDs in one day makes for one of the most rewarding musical experiences available.<br /><br />The recorded sound is superb and Uchida is in top form for each selection.  This is fine as Schubert gets and the entire set is more than well worth the relatively modest price.  For lovers of the piano, of Mitsuko Uchida, and of Schubert this is zenith release.  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, January 06
B000B5UL7G|2.0|In a phrase, there's something Messiah can't afford and can't be forgiven for doing - and RW's just done so. He turned down his former producer and turned to barren era (80s) awaking to his true Neo entity somewhat on two closing tracks. But I'm  already into 3rd phrase, and since the whole thing is so unspeakably boring, I really go tackle neddy affairs at hand... Oh, and wasn't that album a polite nod to UK's popscene entire Coldplay-ishness (hell, it's 5th phrase!).
B00080ZG10|4.0|Martin Scorcese may be one of our most psycho-analyzed directors.  How many times have we heard him tell the story of being forced by illness to listen to the rhythms of life on New York streets from an upstairs window?  So it's perhaps fitting that Scorcese examine one of America's most infamously twisted spirits, Howard Hughes -- mega-rich, mega-handsome, mega-brilliant, and mega-mad. <br /> <br />Hughes is one of those guys who demands a quality biopic.  It's sad that today he's consigned to the ashbin of history thanks to the lurid details of his final years, after his madness had completely taken hold.  But his tragic coda should not diminish his role in American history -- he is truly one of the giants of the 20th century.  A bold businessman, Hughes helped usher in an era of aviation innovation that improved the lives of millions . . . and he did so in grand style. <br /> <br />\\"The Aviator\\" gets the highest marks as a technical exercise.  You will be hard-pressed to find a more handsome film, with a more winning, convincing look and manner.  Evocative of high-class America in the 1920s-40s, \\"The Aviator\\" wears its time period with casual elegance, and that's all to the good. <br /> <br />Also on the emphatic plus-side is one of the best ensemble casts ever put together.  Leonardo DiCaprio disappears into the role of Hughes, capturing his joys as a man of the skies as well as his descent into madness.  It's a bit unfair that DiCaprio's most famous role is the pretty-boy Jack from \\"Titanic,\\" 'cause he is the genuine article when it comes to the acting game.  Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her portrayal of Hughes' love and Hollywood goddess Kate Hepburn.  And Alan Alda tries to steal the movie as a craven U.S. Senator.  There are dozens of minor supporting performances (too many to mention) that are also spot-on.   <br /> <br />The movie focuses on the middle years of Hughes' life as he transitions from millionaire playboy to aviation titan.  Hughes has dreamsof conquering Hollywood (which he almost does) and the aviation world, then-dominated by Pan Am Airlines.  We get to see a bit of Hughes' ultimate descent into madness and despair, but we don't see the final wreck he became in his final years.   <br /> <br />But ultimately, \\"The Aviator\\" keeps the viewer somewhat at arm's length.  Part of this may come from Hughes' eccentricities, which may manifest themselves in odd ways (\\"germophobia\\"), but also force Hughes to push everyone around him away.  We're also kept at arm's length by Hughes' love life.  Hughes spends a lot of time on the arms and in the beds of some of Hollywood's leading ladies (Ava Gardner, Ms. Hepburn, and many others), but he's also the kind of guy who creepily auditions a high-school girl for the role of mistress and then emotionally abuses her (off-screen) to the point that she rams Hughes with her car at a posh Hollywood restaurant.  And then she's off, never to be seen again.  But Scorcese's treatment of this odd aspect of Hughes' life feels cursory, almost like it was a bit too dark to fit into Scorcese's generally-sympathetic treatment of his protagonist.  And that feels false.   <br /> <br />The only exception to the movie's lack of intimacy comes when Hughes is in the cockpit of one of his many planes.  Whether it's while filming his horrifically overbudget epic, \\"Hell's Angels,\\" or setting a new air speed record, or coaxing the Spruce Goose into the air for a few seconds, it's the sight of Hughes doing what he loves more than anything else -- flying -- that lets the audience soar with Hughes.  For the rest of the movie, we're watching Hughes with an almost-painful awareness of what he will become, but the movie keeps us pushed away, just enough.  The great biopics bring you \\"into the family,\\" while the merely-good (\\"De-Lovely\\" being a recent example) show us an interesting life, but don't let get too close.   <br /> <br />Still, \\"The Aviator\\" deserves to be seen, and Hughes, for all his faults and flaws, is a man worthy of a great film.  In many ways, \\"The Aviator\\" may be the perfect film to tell his story.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|When I started to view the page for this movie, I saw that it had 4.5 stars in 641 reviews.  That should tell you all you need to know about the movie.  Soooooo many people like this movie, and the show that came before it (Firefly), and yet the show got cancelled and the movie didnt make a killing.  I fault the studios (Fox for the show and Universal for the movie), plain and simple.  This movie, this world is one you will want to enter again and again, and it will hurt when you realize you've seen it all.  You'll want more, and start thinking \\"is there anything I can do to get it?\\"  That's how good this movie is.  That's how good the show is.  The characters are gritty and real.  Unlike many movies these days, the script is real to!  Don't pass this one up.  If you like sci fi at all, watch, become a Browncoat, and experience sci fi at what it can be.  Enjoy.

B00006FM77|5.0|I used to hear Chicago a lot when I was in the 5th grade and this recording brings back some old memories.  This collection was recorded in front of a very excited audience and the sound quality is very clear.  I enjoyed all the songs including \\"Colour My World,\\" \\"Make Me Smile,\\" and \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time it Is?\\"  However, my favorite song on the recording is \\"25 or 6 to 4.\\"  I have enjoyed that song since I was in elementary school.  The best part of this collection is listening to Peter rock out with his lead vocals on \\"25 or 6 to 4.\\"  I would recommend this recording to all fans as well as those just getting introduced to this group.

076780421X|4.0|FOOLS RUSH IN is a feel-good comedy that's as cute as a litter of yapping labs.  It's as cute as a dimple on a six-year-old; even cuter than a panda cub on the Discovery Channel.  Paying homage to the reverent truth that opposites attract, FOOLS RUSH IN delivers giggles, chuckles, and laughs.<br /><br />In a cute way, mind you.<br /><br />Actions have consequences--even following a one-night stand.  Matthew Perry and Salma Hayek play Alex and Isabel, two independent people who suddenly inherit a very dependable situation.  The result is marriage by osmosis; the somewhat anal Alex tries to adjust to the free-spirited Isabel.  Throw in the fact both people come from radically different cultures, and this ad hoc union is either doomed for divorce court--or blessed with loving endurance.<br /><br />Matthew Perry surprised me with his gift for comedic timing and facial expressions (but heck, Perry is a sitcom veteran, so why should I be surprised?), while Salma's glistening brown baby does could make me run through a brick wall.  Both actors play wonderfully off one another, and despite the story being predictable, FOOLS RUSH IN is a grand way to spend 90 minutes of one's day.  And you don't even have to be cute to enjoy it.<br /><br />--D. Mikels
0790733226|4.0|I don't need to say much since most of the reviewers here are right on with their opinions of Contact, but I have to say:  the scene where the radical religious terrorist destroys the first launch site literally had my mouth hanging open...I'm not easily shocked my movies, but the special effects combined with the cinematography of that sequence had me in complete shock...a truly awe-inspiring film.
6301966562|5.0|Went looking for this movie after seeing Virginia Madsen in \\"Sideways\\"...I first fell in love with her in 1984 after seeing this movie.  The memories returned after her performance in \\"Sideways\\".  The original soundtrack (on cassette) and VHS of this movie haven't been retrieved from storage yet, but they will be if this movie isn't out on DVD soon.  I purchased my first computer in 1984 just before the movie was released and was already an ELO fan.  The movie was a bit out of touch with the technology of the time, but the sweetness of the story made that irrelevent.  Virginia hasn't aged a bit from this movie (in my eyes) to today.  I will buy this when it is released on DVD.  ESSENTIAL.

B00005JM02|4.0|this is a family movie, that is good for everyonge to see,
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This edition is absolutely priceless.  My family and I have watched the Muppet Christmas Carol for many, many years.  I understand the concerns of the previous reviewers concerning the deleted song.  But, for family entertainment, as a whole, it should be right up there with the Griswold's in the National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and George C. Scott's rendition of \\"A Christmas Carol\\".   A true joy to own.
0316666343|2.0|i had high hopes for this book since i had heard rumors that peter jackson was taking it on for his next film project.  as i started to read this book, i really felt for the main character.  the descriptions of place and time were well written, however the additional characters in the novel began to blend into each other.  one minute, we think we are really feeling what this teenage girl wanted and loved, then suddenly, it becomes some cheesy harloquin romance novel.  i was extremely disappointed in the last half of the book.  several people have asked to borrow this book since i finished it, i loaned it to them with prejudice.  and all of them came to the same conclusion.  it was a good story and good premise but poorly handled.  if peter jackson really is going to make a movie based on this book, i hope he fixes it!
0307276902|5.0|Call this story a lie or call it the truth or what ever you like but this book is worth reading!  Draw your own conclusion about the author.  Personally, I think the book is well done and my hat goes off to James Frey!!!!!
B00005V9HH|5.0|If you like Kevin Spacey, you have to get this movie.  Definitely one of his best works.  The story is very well written also; this kind of movie is hard to come by these days.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Because every mainstream movie have a soundtrack full of violins, drums and trumpets, is very refreshing to hear this simple and delicate music. It truly grabs the esence of the story and really touch you, especialy if you really loved the movie. Since I saw it I've bought the book and the CD and of course I saved every magazine that covers the movie and their actors.  <br /> <br />Enyoy
B000006MV8|5.0|When I became a huge Badfinger fan, I was 15-years-old and it was 1976.  My brother had gotten copies of \\"Magic Christian Music\\" and \\"No Dice\\" at a used record store, and he played the music for me. I had long heard \\"Come and Get It\\" and \\"No Matter What\\" on the radio, but I had never known who sang those songs. I was amazed when listening to \\"No Dice\\" that Harry Nilsson hadn't written \\"Without You\\", and instead it was this obscure Apple band instead. I immediately became hooked.  Within months, I had copies of the albums as well, along with \\"Badfinger\\", \\"Ass\\", and \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  But the Holy Grail of their music, \\"Straight Up\\" could not be found.  The album was long out of print by this time, and it could not be ordered through any record store I went to.  I then spent two years searching through used record bins and discount record bins, hoping that somehow this magical record had slipped unnoticed into the black hole of forgotten artists in one of those bins.  When I was 17, I found two copies, priced at $2 each in a record store downtown.  I clutched both of these new, still-in-shrink-wrap prizes and ran with them to the cash register, barely able to contain myself.  One copy for me, and one for my brother! When I got the record home, I must have played it 1,000 times before putting it back in its sleeve.   Years later, I saw a vinyl copy of \\"Straight Up\\" on sale at a Beatlesfest for over $100.  At this time, 1992, it was still not available on CD.  As a teenager, I had 300 or 400 albums.  Through the years, they all have either been given away or discarded.  Today I am 44-years-old and my Badfinger collection still remains.  The music on this album is timeless.  \\"Take it All\\" is just as worthy for airplay as \\"Baby Blue\\", and catches your attention from the beginning.  The album reminds me of the Beatles \\"White Album\\" as it is the rare album where every track is as good as the next.  My person favorites are \\"Perfection\\" and \\"Name of the Game\\".  Pete Ham'svocals are flawless and his lyrics haunting. If I could have only one album in my record collection, this would be it.  The CD is a real treat, as it offers up different versions of songs I've loved for over 25 years.
B00005JMJG|4.0|I didn't get the chance to see this film in theatre because I don't know why but it was not screened in my country. I was reading very positive comments about it for over 2 years and I was very curious about it. So I ordered it from amazon and I watched it the second I got it, and let me tell you something the reviews you read are not a single bit exaggerated. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a love story, but it is not a clich, seeing it doesn't raise the question inside yourself \\"I think I've seen this before...\\". And the casting is a perfect match. If you still haven't seen it, be quick and order it. You'll be gladly satisfied. As for the dvd, it's a nice widescreen edition, sound and picture quality is ok but I just didn't like the menus. Other than that for this price it's a nice dvd.
B000056HUA|5.0|If you do have a DVD Audio (not only DVD Video) capable player and a properly set up 5.1 speaker system - you will enjoy this DVD-Audio very much. If you're into the Doors, too, of course. I read different reviews of the surround mix. In my opinion, it is great and tastefully done. There are some gimmicks, yes, but overall you get a feeling of sitting with the boys in the studio, surrounded by music. And that's what the surround sound of a DVD-Audio or SACD is all about. 5 stars. I'm not getting into the music itself - there are hundreds of reviews on L.A. woman elsewhere.
B000001F5F|5.0|Best Live U2 Album ever ! Recorded in a spiritual venue, Red Rocks, CO. All U2 fans need this in their collection.
0143057375|5.0|When I was first introduced to \\"The Power of Now\\", it was a revolutionary. It opened up many aspects of my spiritual discovery that just hadn't quite been accessable, although I'd been studying spiritual teachings of all sorts fo years. \\"The Power of Now\\" was the first teaching that made all of the other teachings suddenly make sense. <br />  So, after 8 years, is Echart's follow up book a worthy successor? Yes. While many of the themes of this book were introduced in \\"The Power of Now\\", \\"Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\\" deepens these insights & provides more direct experience. I've passed on innumerable copies of \\"The Power of Now\\" to friends & family & will likely do the same with \\"Awakening\\". On both books, I've found the audio versions to be easier to digest. (This has also been the case for many I've introduced these teaching to.) When listening rather than reading, less of your mind gets involved & there's not the tendency to keep rereading sections trying to understand them. As Eckhart says, your mind can't understand this... only YOU can. This may sound like nonsense to some, but the truth of it is felt when you're ready for it.  I listen to the CD's a lot when I'm traveling by car & it is amazing how swiftly time flies when it's just one long moment of Now.  \\"Awakening\\" can also be a wonderful affirmation of how far you've come on your path! To anyone who's read \\"The Power of Now\\" & found enlighenment there, \\"Awakening\\" will take you even further down the path.
B0000TB050|5.0|Even after watching the latest DVD (Vertigo Tour - Chicago),  we keep coming back to this one. Of course, no DVD beats any live U2 performance, but this DVD is as close as you can get to being there. If you only want to own one U2 Live DVD, look no further.
B000AWYOGE|5.0|I enjoyed the movies plot. Even though it's a remake, it felt like an  original. Perfect acting from Jennifer.  You must watch this movie.<br />Dorky lawyer, making promises.<br />Superintendent, you really want to avoid.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This movie was truely awesome.  This is not just a movie for the gay community it is a movie for everyone.  The movie has a great message and crushes a lot of the typical thoughts about gay people.  Bring you tissue though cause it is sure to make you cry if you have half of a heart.  GREAT MOVIE!!
B00005ATQD|2.0|Stanley Kubrick will always be my favorite movie director, right up there with Hitchcock and Scorsese.  But this film is not one of my favorites.  The story line is confusing.  There are some scenes that are unnecessary (i.e. the doctor with the prostitute).  And the length of the movie was brutal.  The film could have been chopped off by an hour.  As for the sexual content, I thought they could have used more of it.  It was a let down.  This swan song was a sad ending to a brilliant career.
B0000057C5|5.0|Du Hast translates to \\"You have\\" (from haben=to have) not hate! You hate would be Du Hasst (from hassen=to hate.) The song is a play on the German wedding vows, the word is pronounced the same (it's a friggen homonym) and is meant to have a double meaning, as many of their lyrics do. <br /> <br />The English version of the song is \\"You Hate\\" (it is an english VERSION not simply a translation of the original into english,) but remember, many things are lost in translations, especially rhyme schemes! For a great example of this look at the Nena song from the '80's \\"99 Luftballons\\" (translates is 99 Air Balloons) yet the english version is \\"99 Red Balloons\\" and has completely different lyrics and sucks in english!
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I sympathise with the people here who have expressed their disappointment at having no English dub track, but the good news is that the forthcoming Region 2 version has the TV series voice actors on it, price $24.75. Also available at the reasonable price of $53.05 is the 1st Stand Alone series but (I am informed) minus  DTS sound. Check them out on Amazon.Co.UK
B000002UWE|5.0|These are some of the great songs from my college days, and since we're listening to digital music now rather than albums, the music is so much richer than what I remember.  I'm glad I bought this one.
0307276902|2.0|I struggled through this book filled with horrific descriptions of agony and suffering, simply because I thought it was true!  In fact, I frequently told myself that no one could make up something this attrocious!  Essentially, it's the only way I was able to endure the entire book.  As I turned the pages, I found myself wondering how he could possibly remember the details so clearly, given the fact he was out-of-his-head much of the time.  Midway through the book, my husband asked if it was a good book, and I explained that if it were a fictional story, the author couldn't write himself out of a wet paper bag, so in a word, I described it as \\"sad.\\"  Turns out the \\"sad\\" part is that I paid good money for this drivel!
0195067142|5.0|The author, who quit a slot in an officers training program to fight as an enlisted Marine, has given us a powerful memoir of his experiences fighting in two of the toughest battles of the Pacific War.  Slegde (called \\"Sledgehammer\\" by his commrades) manages to evoke both the stench, fear, stress and horror of combat together with the \\"everyday\\" heroism of the men forced to endure this hell.  Sledge doesn't glorify war, but he does glorify the human spirit of its survivors.  I have read a handful of books on combat experiences and this is one of the best.  An excellent source for those who want to understand both the highest and lowest extremes of human nature as called forth by one of the most brutul conflicts ever fought by American troops.
1580086810|5.0|I bought many food related books this year... this one was by far the most mesmerizing and informative. Thank you!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|The quality of the acting was good. For the most part the plots were good. I did enjoy it and regret that it was taken off before it had a following. Certainly not a star trek, but a good show nonetheless.
B00005JOFO|3.0|I thought this film was incredibly well made on nearly every technical aspect, beautiful and haunting and authentic. The acting was also very, very good. The period was represented amazingly well and the score and direction were also both simply great and restrained.<br /><br />Unfortunately this movie is way over-hyped and my main problem with it is that it asks us to sympathize with men cheating on their wives. All I could think of the whole time was how terrible they were. People think they were being \\"brave\\", but in reality it doesn't matter that they were gay and in love - because they were destroying other people's lives and it's not fair or noble in any way.<br /><br />I could only sympathize with the wives at the end of the film.<br /><br />Other than that fact that these characters aren't (to me) very likeable, and the aforementioned over-hype, I'd say it's very much a worth-watching quality drama.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|If you like the Sex and the City series, then this is for you.  It is a complete collection of all the shows, plus has some extras...I liked having a complete set rather than buying each season individually.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great show if only more people had gotten it. I would have liked to see where they were going with some of the sub-stories.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|It has been years since I have so hated a film. Rent it and cringe if you must, but don't even think of buying it unseen.  <br /> <br />When the film did not simply drift from one act of random violence to the next, it meandered into scenes of astonishing sadism performed by absolutely repellent characters with bad accents. <br /> <br />There was little to no plot, the effects are choppy when not gorey, and the story was minimal and composed of scenes stolen from dozens of much better films. The only bit of Gilliam genius in the film were the dozens of little fairy tale quotes that punctuate the action. <br /> <br />An absolute waste of time on par with Munchausen. My advice to producers: For god's sakes please stop giving Gilliam big checks. He makes excellent films when reined in on a tight budget, but monsterous piles of celuloid excrement when given tonnes of cash.
B00005LK95|4.0|I saw the original Short Circuit when it first came out and recently bought it on DVD.  I enjoyed it just as much and found that age had not dimmed the humour.  I had no idea a sequel had been made until Amazon emailed me to let me know (that is a great service by the way).  Normally sequels are a letdown so I was in two minds whether to order it or not but thought, why not as the price was right.  I am pleased that I did as again I thoroughly enjoyed it and can honestly say that the sequel is just as good as the original.  Without giving away the storyline, there are some sad moments where I was amazed to find myself empathising with a robot!! <br />This is one of those movies that while lightweight, do make you feel good after watching them and I do believe that we need a dash of this every now and again.
B000002UDG|5.0|Great cd! Takes me back to a favorite time in my life.
B00007JMCX|4.0|I don't claim to understand everything about this film, nor have I read the book. But despite being confused, I was blown away by the movie for it's execution of both the larger picture of literal alienation and overwhelming human culture, and also the small, inconclusive details that make you sit back and think \\"huh?\\".  <br /> <br />It's a slow film for the most part, but I was able to stay with it without much struggle due to the captivating photography and the excellent performance of David Bowie. He is fascinating to watch in this role, both inscrutable and deeply human. The manipulation of time also keeps you engaged, though maybe at times out of sheer determination to understand the purposeful ambiguities of the story.  <br /> <br />So to conclude, I'd say that this film will probably be frustrating to many people (especially, from what I've heard, those who have read the more lucid book). But for those who want to contemplate its possible meanings, or simply have the patience to let the experience wash over you, it will be captivating and thought-provoking.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I admit that Panic! At The Disco's Brendon has a similiar singing sound as Fall Out Boy's Patrick, but their voices are different, and I love both their styles, so, yeah, back to Panic! At The Disco... <br /> <br />They've got an amazing music style, in accordance with Brendon's sugar-sweet voice. They are young and smart (...maybe I'm just saying that because I like them. Or maybe I am saying that because it is true.), and Ryan uses his extensive vocabulary well. <br /> <br />And... yeah, if you have a taste for techno-ish, punk rock music, big beat, and a sprinkle of emo, pick this CD out. <br /> <br />(P.S. --If not, and you leave a comment, don't just say that they suck, explain why. Sorry... it always bothers me... and when people say definatly. It's definitely.  :P) <br />kthnxbye
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album is an excellent compilation of songs that are soulful and haunting. Something strangely soothing about Rice that makes him one of those artists you just have to listen to regularly.
0736063684|5.0|I have a number of books on strength training. This is the best for showing the anatomy of what is actually happening during the sets. It also talks about problem areas like the rotator cuff and shows the structure of the cuff and the muscles involved.  <br /> <br />This book in addition to the \\"Book of Muscule\\" by Ian King are the two best references for someone who does strength training. <br /> <br />I had read the reviews of this book and thought about buying it. I saw a copy at my gym and I instantly saw how good it is.
0790740443|2.0|The basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a 'killing-machine' integrate back into society.  Yes, it's been done before but still holds promise.  The plot was adequate. <br /> <br />The acting was believable - no complaints there.  I particularly enjoyed Sean Pertwee as 'Mace'.  And Jason Isaacs has long been a favorite actor. <br /> <br />But what ruined the movie for me was the science.  I'm not a fanatic - I have no problems with FTL travel or spaceships 'banking' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies.  And I realize that movies are not 'real'.  But I've never seen more 'bad' science in any one movie.  My son and I watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers.   <br /> <br />I could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night.  It spoiled the whole movie for me.
B000BOH8XW|1.0|It is awful.  I LOVED \\"Laundry Service\\" and was hoping for a good follow up but this isn't it.  Not one song from this album will make it on to my iPod and I can't remember the last album I bought that was that bad. <br /> <br />Every song feels unfinished.  Even when there is a good song, they throw something weird and out of place into it to ruin it.  A weird bridge, some out of place grating vocal.  I love her voice.  They really had to work hard for me to find it unpleasant but they managed. <br /> <br />It's like they got bored working on a song and just quit.  Someone decided the song was good enough, but unfortunately it wasn't. <br /> <br />Almost every song on this album is a good start.  If somebody remixed them, there are several hits here and a lot of good songs waiting to escape. <br /> <br />Contrast this with another album I bought at the same time \\"Charmed The Soundtrack\\".  EVERY song on this album is polished.  EVERY song is going on my iPod.  Even though some are a little weird or not a style of music I usually listen to, they are all very well done. <br />
1573223085|5.0|The book is excellent and thought provoking.  I have purchased 20 copies and given them to my friends and clients.  I found Pink's overall analysis on point.  THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!
B000BB1MIC|4.0|To be honest I only ever heard of Gilmore Girls one time before when the mother and daughter of the series were mocked by the Family Guy and my wife had a quick retort to the show's defense. Then, not a week later, she begged me to buy her this box set for Christmas. In some ways I'm glad I did, and in others I'm kicking myself at the same time for not just buying her Season 1, as I'm still kind of lost at the moment entering a series so late into it's over all drama.<br /><br />In my research, prior to watching season five I learned that this show's premise is supposed to be a mother and daughter who are so close that people mistake them for sisters. Something must have gone horribly wrong along the way because in Season Five I felt that there was a sharp wedge between Lorelei and Rory... a huge sharp wedge. I don't know if that was there all along, or if it's new, but I felt a mother desperately trying to get close to her daughter, only to be pushed away by the 19 year old.<br /><br />To be honest this show was a mixed bag for me, again coming into it so late, though my wife was very excited to receive this Christmas present, and was able to hop right into the set I took longer to get my bearings in the story, and have come to certain conclusions that may not accurately reflect the series as a whole.<br /><br />Firstly, that the show opened up with Rory helping what I later earned is her ex-boyfriend commit adultery didn't exactly put her in a favorable light with me, and said ex-boyfriend, Derek, seemed to have a really sweet, very loving wife who was desperate to please him, and crushed when she learned of his infidelity. This did not put him in a favorable light with me either. Neither character found redemption with me throughout the season, especially with the huge decision that Rory has to make when Preppy boy Logan comes into the picture (who looks freakishly like the guy I sit behind at work I might add...) I did not find a single redeeming quality to Rory, and I came to really detest Derek. I'm not too fond of Rory's grandmother either who is even more shallow and self absorbed than she is!<br /><br />Thankfully, there's Lorelei who is funny, charming, and witty, and (According to my wife) finally with the guy of her dreams and they exhibit some amazing chemistry. I especially enjoyed the episode where the whole town finds out that they are together, and how the town reacts to it, and how they react to their reaction! It was a very funny episode. Lorelei is what made this season so enjoyable for me as she did for Gilmore Girls what Qui Gon Jin did for Star Wars Episode 1, held the show together, and prevented it from becoming un-enjoyable. You see, unlike her daughter and her mother, Lorelei is not shallow, hollow, and self-serving. She's quite the opposite in fact. There were numerous occasions where it was tempting for me to forward through Rory's scenes just to get back to her mother again. She does an excellent job keeping an otherwise stale story afloat, and making it actually entertaining! The show is slower paced, and more character driven, but as long as you don't mind that you'll probably find this series enjoyable.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest head scratching moment I had was when I read the back of the package and noticed a small add for the series' sound track... The music is used very rarely, and what is there is uninspired. Numerous heavily dramatic moments passed in this season where (especially with Rory) I just wasn't feeling it from the actors, this lack of feeling could have been eliminated with some dramatic score, an acoustic guitar... anything, But in most cases there was nothing. I suppose after 5 season you might have enough licensed material for a single CD, but don't expect much from the show itself.<br /><br />The sound was decent for what it is; plenty loud on its own merits, but lacking any explosions and anything fancy like that it doesn't really need anything big sound wise so it delivers for what it is. The video is light years better than the grainy mess that was American Gothic, but its still not as clean as say 24 (Insert whatever season you choose) and for the sharp trained eye be warned there are frame rate drops which causes the camera movement and the action on the screen to appear somewhat choppy. Its very subtle, and having worked in film editing myself, most likely the result of the way it was filmed (probably digital) rather than the video transfer. This effect is less noticeable on a smaller screen, and isn't as bad as the first couple seasons of Deep Space Nine where any sharp movement of the actors or the camera caused significant choppiness in the presentation, as well as a motion blur. Gilmore Girls Season 5's frame rate dips are nowhere near that bad, but are noticeable on a big screen like mine, and my wife noticed them as well. Again people running this on a smaller TV (Like DS9 before it) may not find it all that noticeable.<br /><br />In all honesty this is not a show I would have been drawn to on my own, but like I said I am glad I got introduced to it. It's one of the WB's better efforts, and although some of the lead characters seem shallow and self-serving they can be pretty true to life. I've lived in small towns, I know people like Lorelei and Rory, for better or worse, and so it's easy to get drawn into the show because of that. My recommendation is that this show is best for fans, or for folks who don't mind slower paced, more character driven shows, and especially for folks who live in smaller rural areas. I'll probably pick up the other seasons gradually myself, as I identify greatly with Luke and my wife, incidentally, has a personality very similar to Lorelei, which makes the show that much more enjoyable for us both. Plus its nice to have a show that we can both agree on, since she usually detests the horror shows I like to watch.deo is light years better than the grainy mess that was American Gothic, but its still not as clean as say 24 (Insert whatever season you choose) and for the sharp trained eye be warned there are frame rate drops which causes the camera movement and the action on the screen to appear somewhat choppy.

0783226888|5.0|One of my most watched DVDs. This movie is ingenious. The mix of sarcastic/subtle humor and action is what keeps drawing me going back every few months to watch it again. Maybe it's the cool soundtrack or the over the top but hilariously timed choreography. The director knew what he was doing. Those that get it will love the movie and watch it again and again. Those that compare it too the original or get their meat torqued over anything they think is implausable or those that consider themsleves too 'sophisticated' are better off staying away. This is a great movie. I like it in a similiar way as I do The Saint with Val Kilmer. It would appear that unless a movie has a 80 pound woman with a large cranium skilled in martial arts or a gay cowboy or a rapper turned actor, it will be looked down upon over an upturned nose.

6300184080|5.0|Most of the reviews are based on the \\"Director's Cut\\" version of Mask. It's just my personal opinion but I enjoyed the theatrical version just because I'm a Bob Seger fan.  <br />
0553801503|2.0|I am hugely upset that Martin's work seems to be going in the same direction as Robert Jordan's self indulgent meanderings. I could not have enjoyed the first three books any more. I read each three times and I was as excited about \\"A Feast for Crows\\" as I have ever been for any series-type novel. This book was really tough to get through and would have been next to impossible to finish if I had not enjoyed the previous books so much and was not so hungry to see what was going to happen next. I will certainly read Martin's next installment but it's going to have knock my head off to make me want to read any more after that.
0201633612|5.0|Excellent book. Well organized, no void bla-bla-bla, just information. For the first time I've heard about  this book long ago, but I've really read it when I already had 9 years of C++ experience. Still, this book appeard to be very useful and helpful for me. <br /> <br />I would recomend it to anyone who wants to improve his skills in designing and developing of expandable and reliable applications. Must-have book for any software developer.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|For starters, I'll have to agree with the reviewer that said John Mayer Trio sounds like Stevie Ray Vaughan reincarnated.  From the first note to the last, I have been caught up and moved by the soulful singing, tight rhythms and incredible guitar work on Try!  It's been living in my car CD player and playing nearly nonstop on my portable player since I got it.  I'm not sure why some of the reviewers had a problem with the sound quality on the CD.  I thought the sound was good throughout.   <br /> <br />Regardless of what you think of John Mayer's other offerings, give this CD a chance (I could be cute and say \\"Try!\\").  John Mayer Trio has made me want to pick up a guitar again for the first time in nearly 20 years.
6305127646|5.0|<br />This movie will always hold a dear place in my wife and I's DVD collection. Val Kilmer is the most underated actor today even though he is considered by american pop/bubble gum/Britney/fivty cent/tatoo on the lower back culture to be over the hill. After seeing him in Tombstone, who is a better actor? Oh, I know ... sorry can't think of any. Ice T, Vin Diesel? I rest my case. The old school which I enjoy watching (Pacino, Defoe, Gibson, Eastwood, Hackman, etc) won't be around forever. Who is there now? The next 20 year old pretty boy aimed at the 12-18 year old female crowd? The only other actors my age or younger I consider worthy are Depp, Colin Farrel, and the guy from the Bourne movies. All venting aside I am sure there are others I'm missing but you get my point. The Saint is a smart, action packed, fun movie that I'll enjoy watching again and again. You British and your fish and chips. Do you like it? What do you like about it? It was a gift from my mother... I was laughing thoughout the movie at the way the sardonic humor was used to keep things from being too serious. How about What a long beautiful cane you have to go with your beautiful eyes? stated by Kilmer in the 'cozy little German transit lounge'. Very funny stuff and a great movie for those that can recognize a great movie when they see one and not take themselves too serious.
B000069KGM|5.0|Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) at one time went by the group name \\"the BIG THING\\".  This CD/album and Chicago II are there best work.  Terry Kath, Peter Cetera, Robert Lamm with that incredible horn section and great drum work by Danny Seraphine make this one of the all time pleasures of music.  I loved them in High School and this album still rocks!
B000002KK2|5.0|Even though this CD is more than 25 years old the music is timeless and Ricki Lee Jones still has one of the smoothest, sexiest voices around. This is a great CD.
B00008CLNQ|5.0|Karajan made many fine Brhams recordings, including three complete symphony cycles for DG. I bought this one for the remastered sound, which is excellent. I am not positive that much improvement would be casually noticed in the three digital recordings here, Sym. #1 (1987), #2 (1986), and #3 (1988), but DG has skipped the digital Sym. #4 and substituted a 1978 analog recording that now has immaculate sound--I believe it was available previously in a budget Galleria issue.<br /><br />To me, Karajan was the greatest Brahmsian of his generation, but I've also felt that he missed something in the Fourth compared to Carlos Kleiber, Furtwangler, and Bernstein. This one is the best of his three versions, in that we sense struggle in the finale--Karajan tended to smooth things over, especially in his last, digital performance. So this two-fer set is very welcome and constitutes an incredible bargain.<br /><br />P.S. -- as of early 2008, DG did the right thing and remastered Karajan's Brahms cycle from the Sixties, long my favorite for interpretation. You have to buy the readings on separate CDs -- the First is paired with the Schumann First -- but the price is midrange.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is a must for any animation(not just japanese) fan. The music in the action scenes is a little dated but the animation and story are solid. As classic Miyazaki you can count on wonderful characters and story-telling that is surprising and not one-sided. This is the version you want, totally intact and what Studio Ghibli intended it to be.  Has extra features and two language tracks, I highly recommmend the Japanese.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I was so excited to see this set but I never thought I'd actually buy it. I did and I am so glad. I long ago gave up my HBO subscription (but will likely renew when Soprano's comes back in March); I thought the only way I'd ever see these shows again was on TNT where so much is edited out it's like a different show.  Save your pennies and ask for Amazon gift certificates for your birthday - this is totally worth it.
B000AADYUI|5.0|It was nice to play this cd and hear the original lyrics from the album. I know it doesn't seem like much to change Andromeda to South America from Let's go Together, but to me it changed the context of the album. Andromeda fits in with space where South America didn't. After hearing Which Side Are You On from A Guide Through Chaos,I could see where it came from but I still like the original lyrics better. As someone who memorized the lyrics back when the album was released, it surprised me when the first issue to cd came out and the alternate lyrics were applied. So thanks again and with either lyrics this is one great album and always has been. To finish of the sci-fi collection check out planetearthrockandroll.com and add the final one to the set.

0307276902|5.0|I'd like to tell you another true story about redemption and strife. A lofted character raised on high, teetering with excess and frailty. Unaware of his plight which caused those around him such anguish, he tipped and tilted, wobbled and spun, precariosly close to the abyss. When at last feeling vindicated and secure the impending doom befell him. Caught between heaven and hell, falling through the space of a dark abyss, drugged and screaming, he crashed.<br /><br />And all the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put humpty dumpty back together again.

And something happens to them that will change their life.The three Grace children then go on an extraordinary adventure.  <br /> I would recommend this book to other kids should read this book if they loves adventures, battles, and a lot of fantasy.

0596007124|5.0|If your previous attempts to learn design patterns have induced bouts of narcolepsy, Head First has a better idea. Using their now familiar and very effective teaching style, the design patterns are presented with fun and humor. Off-beat coding examples in Java are used to illustrate the problems that the patterns are to solve and the pattern-influenced solutions. For those of us who are micro-confined, the C# version is available from the website. <br /> <br />Rather than teach just the design patterns, the underlying object-oriented principles are taught, for example \\"Favor composition over inheritance\\". Not only does this reinforce the understanding of the pattern, but also it better enables the developer to apply the pattern appropriately. Emphasis is also placed in understanding the differences between similar patterns or patterns that support similar principles.  <br /> <br />The depth of coverage that the book delivers requires that the focus is on the most frequently used patterns with the rest of the GOF patterns being briefly mentioned in the appendix. <br /> <br />When I first saw the book, I was curious about how this would work out. After all, everything that I had seen on design patterns had not been the least bit amusing, but not to fear the Head First team has created a real gem. Maybe the Head First crew could tackle UML or Test Driven Development for us and make them fun to learn, also. We can only hope.
0385334206|5.0|Every time I read this book, I find something new.  It is very funny and not necessarily as grim as some people seem to find it.  The book to me seems a comic meditation on being an animal in a world of animals and being just smart enough to know that you don't like your culture (American/Western) and thus have no culture at all to provide you with comfort as you live in such an unjust and brutal world.
B000002UAC|5.0|This is a mix of original Lennon/McCartney songs and R&B classics such as Roll Over Beethoven. It is good to hear some of the music that influenced Lennon and McCartney as only the Beatles could sing them.
1881273156|4.0|I believe this to be a very helpful book.  I have yet to read the entire book but have read parts and know the general ideas of the book.  For those out there that say about them not being married and not being a Christian I politely say it is a Christian book to married people.  If you want something that is for singles, there is a Five Love Languages book just for SINGLES! And if you choose not to follow a Christian way of live and don't want to hear about the Christian way of life as it relates to love, then just don't read it or make sure you check it out before buying it.  And to those who say that the answer to ending all divorce is man submitts to God and wife to man then all I have to say is reevaluate your thinking because Scripture teaches that men and women are to be equals in a marriage and they are to submit to God and TO EACH OTHER.  Yes that means a man is to submit to his wife! This means a woman is NOT a doormat. <br /> <br />I know from my own experiences it has helped me to relate better to my fiancee since we have different primary love languages.  He prefers time spent where I do like that but I am way different on that end than he is.
B00005B36H|5.0|Let me say that I own every tool album.  I've also seen the band live in concert three different times (between 2001 and 2002, so it was all the lateralis tour).   <br /> <br />I am not going to analyze this with prose or anything extreme like that, I'd rather give you a no-bull type review.  If you like tool you'll like this album.  it's different than opiate and undertow on many songs.  while many of the songs are heavy rock, many of them are what i would call \\"3-D rock.\\"  the drumbeats are incredible.  on some levels this music can be euphoric.  this album is not one that you can throw in and bang your head on every song.  while there is some heavier stuff there are also some really \\"chilled-out\\" tracks on here.  when i bought it i didn't really like it that much.  since then, it has grown to be my second favorite tool album (second to undertow).  i give this album a 5-star rating because i cannot give it a 4.5, and its better than a 4.   <br /> <br />breakdown of the songs. <br /> <br />1. the grudge:  released on the radio, but fortunately not overplayed.  has a neat riff behind the lyrics for most of the song.  listen to it more than once before you develop you opinion because before long you'll be banging your head to the beat!  8.5/10 <br /> <br />2. Eon blue apocalypse:  a short interlude into the next song.  no rating <br /> <br />3. the patient:  a song that starts out with a very slow rhthym, but after a min or two when it picks up, hold onto your hat! maynard's voice is great \\"but i'm still right here....\\"  one of my fav's on the cd 9.5/10  learn to love this song! <br /> <br />4. mantra: another short piece leading into the next song. these \\"songs\\" or whatever you wanna call them are sooooo cool live! no rating <br /> <br />5. schism:  i think you either love or hate this song.  it took me forever to get into it.  i like it, but, at least in my area, it was waaayyy overplayed.  \\"i know the pieces fit....\\"  i give it a 7/10 <br /> <br />6. parabol:  very slow song, made to be played right before track 7 (parabola).  it is a setup track that flows into parabola very well. 8/10 <br /> <br />7. parabola:  a much louder song than parabol, its great!  the signature part of this song is maynard's long lyric about half way through.  i dont even know what he says, listen to the song and you'll see what i mean.  i give it an 8.5/10 <br /> <br />8. ticks & leeches:  this song is great.  it has a wierd quiet section of it in the last 1/3 of the track.  a pretty heavy song.  hardcore lyrics by maynard.  it took me forever to get into this song.  i'd say an 9/10 <br /> <br />9. lateralis:  an amazing song! its almost two songs in one.  a signature riff in the beginning.  drum beats fill in the sound. then heavy guitar and a sweet verse complete the sound.  one of my favs.  a great title track.  i say 10/10   <br /> <br />10.  disposition:  a very \\"chill\\" track.  really neat drums in the background.  slow-paced guitar that leads into some low-key lyrics by maynard \\"watch the weather change....\\"  this song is almost like a setup to \\"reflection\\" at least when they did the album live it was meant to be like that. i say 8.5/10 <br /> <br />11. reflection:  drum beat picks up.  i swear i've heard this song in between sets at EVERY rock show that i've been to in the last 5 years.  i say 9.5/10 <br /> <br />12. triad:  this is a cool song that picks up in pace.  signature plucks on e string of guitar.  drums are a little more hardcore.  i say 9/10 <br /> <br />13. faaip de oiad: last song has some wierd stuff before you hear any music.  talking area 51 type stuff 7/10 <br /> <br />this was a long-winded review.  however, anyone who rates every song on an album as a 10/10 doesn't know anything.  its opinion i know, but c'mon, 10/10 i've never seen an album that was perfect.   <br />

B00008BXJG|5.0|At the end of the 1970's, rock 'n' roll was in need of help. Yes, Zeppelin was about to break up and The Rolling Stones had not yet released 'Tattoo You'. 'New Wave' and 'Punk' were dominating the airwaves. So AC/DC absolutely shook the world with their finest and final release with Bon 'Bonny' Scott. This is the one you 'new' generation of AC/DC fans undoubtedly have to get for your collection. Unlike Brian Johnson, Bon's incredible timing and unique sense of humor coupled with his whiskey voice('People say  I have a drinking problem, and I agree...that second litre of bourbon is always a pain in the neck!' -Bon Scott-1978) and rib-crunching lyrics make this one of the hardest rocking albums of all time. Unflinching and eardrum piercing, this album made AC/DC a household name in the USA. Parents went ballistic and hated the 'Satanic' cover and we loved watching Angus 'shred,dude, he f-ing shreds!' How many beers DID I have that evening in San Diego listening to 'Highway to Hell' on my friends' stereo while some girls sninny dipped in the pool?Who cares! That was the time-back in the day. Quite possibly  ACCA DACCA's (How the Aussies nicknamed them) greatest album (Next to Back in Black!)
B0000DG00B|3.0|The Allman Brothers Band<br /><br />Live at the Atlanta International Pop Festival (July 3 & 5, 1970)<br /><br />Epic/Legacy Records E2K86909<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Okay, okay. They're gods and gurus, and what kind of creep of a critic would pick on a dead guy? Well, when the Allman Brothers hit the big time, jamming was a fairly new concept in rock, a novelty that had really made it for Cream and Jimi Hendrix. When a Southern band with ingrained blues instinct and a big jazz tool kit took to the stage and explored simple, traditional blues numbers and originals that were their close kin for up to half an hour, it was something. For those who'd been hooked by Cream and Hendrix, it was a final step up, the completion of a form, the finished product that kind of rock had sought for a couple of years. I listened to it then and was deeply excited and impressed.<br /><br />Thirty-three years have passed, as have a lot of musical fads. Jamming has long sunk back into the world of jazz. plenty of rock bands have figured out what to do with keyboards, and we've had enough blues revivals to choke Rufus Thomas's dog. The novelty aspect is no longer part of our Allman Brothers listening experience. Here's a telling true story -- At some point during the second of these two discs, almost at the end of the 28:20 \\"Mountain Jam,\\" the CD skipped. It skipped for over two minutes before I realized that it was, indeed, a skip, and not just another repetitive, self-indulgent solo.<br /><br />Nobody beats the Allman Brothers for fat-free studio recording quality, poignancy of lyrics and delivery and ability to meld blues, jazz and rock into a unique and wonderful product. This two-CD live reissue, though, just reminds us of a couple of lessons white blues-rockers hadn't figured out yet at the time and what too many haven't learned to this day -- 1) An hour on the bandstand is an hour on the bandstand whether it's used for six songs or 15, but the 15 will hold audience interest better, and 2) After 24 bars of competent solo in a blues, or (liberally stretching it) 48 in the case of the world's greatest players, there's nothing else to say, so get back to the song, finish it, start another song and say something meaningful, as opposed to pyrotechnic, in that one, too.of competent solo in a blues, or (liberally stretching it) 48 in the case of the world's greatest players, there's nothing else to say, so get back to the song, finish it, start another song and say something meaningful, as opposed to pyrotechnic, in that one, too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...the bad thing is, the series lasted only one season.  The good thing is, we are better off to have enjoyed and relished this series, than to never have had it at all. <br /> <br />Firefly is a masterful creation by Joss Whedon, and cover's an intellectual landscape of family, freedom, freewill, identity, survival, space exploration, and civilization.  The series cinematic appeal give's us futuristic technology coupled with a throwback to Western Civilization...a nice mix that blend's beautifully to create a unique yet somewhat familiar world to the present day watcher. <br /> <br />The series covers the lives of nine people who are caught between the world of the structured, ultra civilized society and the lawless dregs who make up the rebellious and forgotten \\"outer planets\\".  The crew are on the ships \\"Serenity\\" of the old firefly class of ships, and led by their capatin Mal Reynolds, try to find their own \\"serenity\\" between the Alliance (A new conglomerate type of governmental rule that was a joining of the U.S. and China), who years ago some fought as browncoats, and the treacherous cast-offs and dregs that space and time forgot. <br /> <br />Where so many Sci-Fi series take place 99% in the \\"holodeck\\" of a ship, Firefly explores a multitude of vast worlds which is brought to us in great and carefully packaged special effects.  Utopia's and Caravan's of the sick, deserts and forests and plateaus's of great vastness make up many of the planet's, as it's told Earth became overpopulated and therefore the ability to \\"Terraform\\" these planets came into play. <br /> <br />But wait, there is more:  The dealings on the ship, the relationships, as well as the intricate web of personalities of the crew coupled with troubled past's and an uncertain future as universal nomad's abounds.  Often they have to take the dirty job, the jobs Alliance forbids, but above all, the job that money cannot buy:  Helping give back a little to Humanity. <br /> <br />The cast is one of the best I've ever seen in any SCI-FI series, bar none.  A diverse set of skills and backgrounds not to mention an equal mix of gender make up the crew as we have the Captain, Soldier, Pilot, Mechanic, Ambassador, Mercenary, Doctor, Fugitive, and Shepherd trying to make their way in the game of survival in the Vast universe 500 years from now.  If you like Science Fiction, or just well written stories with great casting and special effects, hop on board the Serentity! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QG0O|4.0|Nothing compares to the Shrek & Shrek II series. The Toy Story and Toy Story II series is second. My 3 yr old absolutely loves this movie and has made a great gift also.
B0001BKAEE|4.0|Revolutions, while still a good movie, was...off. When I compare it with the first movie, I can see very little resemblence. Like another reviewer said, the team spent years on this movie, and we get this. The storylines felt shoved to the side. The \\"Bring me the Eyes of the Oracle\\" was pointless and did not advance anything. I expected some sort of quest. Nope. Nada. Nothing. In the end, it was a mistake for the Wachowski to make 3 movies. If they had tried for a fourth, with more substance, I definitely feel something better could have been made. It's like Peter Jackson deciding to make 2 LOTr movies instead of 3, it's not enough. This isn't about the ending. It's about the ending happening when it shouldn't have.
B000089RV6|5.0|As a typical 7th grader in 1980, I wanted to know what all the buzz was about regarding 'Back in Black'. Everyone I knew had a copy of this album (yes, a vinyl copy). The first time I heard it I was at my piano teacher's house in Rialto,CA. She had a goregous older daughter who loved the album and would dance to it with her bedroom door open(on purpose?)Anyway, I sat there waiting my turn to play some tedious piano song when Angus' guitar riffs from 'You Shook Me All Night Long\\" thundered from the daughter's room. She was definately 'Knockin' me out with those American thighs!' dressed only in a short t-shirt...Thank you, AC/DC, for that amazing and priceless album! Platinum several times over and still on the radio today, thank God!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I Like the way Mariah uses her voice. I'm glad she is still in the game of music.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Love this CD. This is without doubt the best tribute concert I have ever seen/heard. The music was flawless. The whole DVD / CD is worth buying just to watch/listen to Eric Clapton do \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". The man is truly amazing. The only disappointment at all to me was that \\"Horse to the Water\\" performed by Sam Brown was not included on the CD. Anyone, even those that are not devout Beatles fans will enjoy this CD. I have just about worn it out I've listened so many times.
B000067J1H|5.0|This film is an example of just how strong the media these days is controlled by conservative morals. Smothered by underpromotion, this film was shunned for terrorist allusions and other anarchist subject matter. Of course, as is par for the course with them, conservatives lacked the intellectual depth to see the true meaning behind this film, the metaphor of the desolation of a modern existence. Conservative viewers and media moguls saw the forest for trees. The violence, the bombings, the sex acts. Then they make their predictable logic jumps of what effects it would have on society. <br /> <br />For the controversy alone this film generates, and for its determination to become a succesful cult smash in light of the recent pathetic Victorian morals backlash, this is one of the defining films of my generation. Bold enough to still take risks and not be smothered by money-grubbing corporate hypocrites, right-wing religious folklore pushers, and inept governmental administrations. This film is a classic. <br /> <br />Everyone knows the story, despite the trailers at the time misbilling this as a film about bareknuckle boxing, or whatever. An isolated, disaffected young man, working a dead-end Wilmington, Delaware office job, is lured upon the burning of his apartment into the dangerous and complex world of Tyler Durden. Elaboration beyond this point would be detremential to a first-time viewer curious about this remarkable film. <br /> <br />Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are a dynamite pair, and it was wise casting to accentuate the close friendship these two share in real life. David Fincher's directing style has ushered in a slew of copycats, the true mark of an impactful, brilliant director. But it is Helena Bonham Carter, a British and mostly classical actress playing very much against role here as the slightly whorish, mostly mentally unstable Marla Singer, that makes this film. There's a reason she won Best British Actress at England's version of the Oscars for this role. The conservative Academy shuns anything groundbreaking these days (see their pick of the cliched Gladiator as best picture over Traffic a few years back). The watered-down, sugarcoated American cinema, fearful of censorship and further violations of our freedom of speech and press, needs to step up to the plate with more films like this. And as for the Palahniuk novel on which this is based, it's suggested as an additional read to the film because it is very different in certain essential ways. <br /> <br />If  you care about cinema and its current state of right-wing suppression at all, go and rent this film. Support revolutionaries not oppressed by Bush and his tyrants, and who refuse to be kept from their artistic instincts. Buy Fight Club and join the resistance against conservatism!
B00008DDRX|3.0|This movie is not for everyone.  Not a lot of dialog, a whole lot of LeMans racing.  You better be a Steve McQueen fan or this movie will bore you to death
B00008WT5J|3.0|In 1986, AC/DC was signed to do the music for the Steven King movie(unwatchable!) This must have looked good on paper. The result is an interesting collection of some of their greatest hits. (Bon Scott only is on one song, the incredible 'Ride On.') What is memorable is the amazing title track, 'Who Made Who.' The rest is strange stuff like 'D/T' and instrumental stuff from the film. Oh,well. Not their best work, but more of a collection of 80's hits. As we await a new album...we're still waiting...you can pop this one in for a listen. For the first time fans just discovering AC/DC, I reccomend a true classic like 'If You Want Blood' with Bon Scott performing one of the greatest live recordings ever made.
B0000024K1|5.0|This 1988 disc was revolutionary in many ways and is an example of what hip-hop might have become had it not been for an entire generation of heavily marketed dervishes in parachute pants manipulating stereotypes for a fast buck and guys who used the word \\"bitch\\" as punctuation while shamelessly exploiting their own culture. 18 years later I can still recite the lyrics to every song verbatim and I haven't heard any of the songs in over a decade. Radical, extreme lyrics over mile-wide grooves and all at an unrelenting pace. Fans of the James Brown Band, the JBs and/or Maceo Parker will recognize many of the samples. Excellent, brilliant and \\"radical in the extreme\\". Get it.
0553801503|4.0|I understand the dilemma. The book is just too big to publish in a single volume. Hooray! More of the Seven Kingdoms to enjoy! That's a dilemma I can appreciate. However, I'm not sure I approve of the way the division was done. How much ground are we going to be rehashing in the next volume by going back in time to cover events being experienced by the characters not seen in this book?  <br /> <br />That aside, I have to say how much I love this series. I have been waiting with bated breath for this book for years, and my only disappointment, as I have mentioned, is with the editing decision to remove several characters until the next book. Several of my favorite characters, I might add. For the past week, I have lived in the Seven Kingdoms. When I was not actively reading, I was wishing I was reading. When I was reading, I was scolding myself to read slower, and make it last. I need more! <br /> <br />MR. MARTIN - PLEASE WRITE FASTER!!!
6305949980|4.0|A technical matter - this was filmed @ 1.66:1, meaning that when you play it back on your HD widescreen it is going to show as a box with black borders all around it. If it were properly handled, an anamorphic transfer would blow the image to fill most of the screen except for small black vertical bars along the sides of the screen. If you play this back on a standard 4:3 television it won't matter - it will look just fine. Aside from that, the dvd has an excellent collection of materials. Luckily, I own the HUGE deluxe CAV LaserDisc boxed special edition and it looks like they managed to port all of it to dvd (except for the companion book by Frank Thompson). You could spend weeks admiring this film, frame-by-frame, so meticulous in detail. Elfman's great songs match very well with the story and perfect animation.
B000BIQKXM|5.0|I have to say this album is the best by Westlife thus far. I'm ashamed to admit that I first thought it would just be \\"okay\\" without Bryan (Brian, whatever) McFadden. But they have really proven me wrong. This CD is awesome. I LOVE the covers. That's always been something I like about Westlife. Anyway, here's is the song by song deal.  <br /> <br />YOU RAISE ME UP- I liked this song by Westlife, but it's very hard to make a better version than Josh Groban. His voice is amazing.  <br />WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME- I first heard this song on American Idol last season. I think they even released it?? But I do like the song and Diana Ross is a great match for Westlife. <br />AMAZING- I love this song. Mark is great here. <br />THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND LOVE- Great song. I like how Shane sings pretty high in parts.  <br />SHE'S BACK- I had not heard this song before hearing it from Westlife. Regardless, it's a great song. I love the \\"Tell me why the hell I hear music...\\" part.  <br />DESPERADO- Before hearing this album, I thought Clint Black had sung the best version. But I now know that Westlife has taken that top spot.  <br />COLOUR MY WORLD- This is my favorite song on the album. I can't even believe Mark's voice. Awesome. And Shane really puts a lot into it, too.  <br />IN THIS LIFE- I had only heard Colin Raye sing this before hearing it here. I have to say I like Colin Raye's just a tad better. But it really was a great choice to put it on this album. <br />HEART WITHOUT A HOME- I loved this song from Nick Carter and I love it from Westlife. <br />HIT YOU WITH THE REAL THING- This song reminds me of \\"Everyone\\" from BSB's Black and Blue album. The background does anyway.  <br />CHANGE YOUR MIND- My favorite after Colour My World. I love the upbeat nature. It's one of those songs that puts a smile on your face.  <br />MAYBE TOMORROW- I love this song. I can't believe it's not on some of the other version of FACE TO FACE that have been released.  <br />I definitely recommend buying this album and any by Westlife. I just wish they were as big here in the US as they are worldwide.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|This movie is so beautiful.  <br />I did not want it to ever end.
B000BISBDY|5.0|Cash had such a successful career it would be hard to create a definitive collection of all his best and most important songs, but I think this comes as close as possible, with a single CD.  Sure it would have been great to see a couple more songs.  I would have liked to have seen Orange Blossom Special and Ballad of Ira Hayes.  Everyone probably has their favorites; some are here and some may not be.  Most of the important songs are here (I Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, Folsum Prison Blues and Boy Named Sue to name a few).  Have always liked Johnny Cash, but not a big collector of his work, so several of the songs here were new to me.  Never heard Rusty Cage before and it seems the weakest of all the songs; too much repeating at the end.  The Wanderer (with U2) is not one of the better songs either. <br />Highwayman with Willie Nelson & Kris Kistofferson is a great song, but there isn't much Cash in it.  The first time I listened, I wondered why Willie Nelson was singing in the middle of the Johnny Cash recording, but it was good thing to include the song, as well as the duet with his wife (Jackson).  'Hurt' is a dark and sad song to end the album with.  Something more upbeat would have been a better ending.  Overall, you would have a hard time finding a better variety album of Johnny Cash's work.
B000AP04OM|5.0|My 19 year old daughter's favorite movie of all time is the Sound of Music which we've had on VCR for 15+ years and she's watched a million times.  When she was going away to college she wanted to get the DVD version since the TV has a built in DVD player.  Couldn't find it anywhere in stores, so on a whim I checked Amazon.  My daughter was very pleased with her belated Christmas present!
0804106304|4.0|Joy Luck Club Review <br />The Joy Luck club orients itself around four Chinese immigrants and their daughters. The mothers fear they have not passed their life-stories and knowledge onto their daughters, while the daughters choose to ignore their mothers and their Chinese heritage. In the end the daughters undergo a transformation and accept their mothers and begin to accept their heritage and the way they were raised. This theme of cultural misunderstanding is exacerbated by adding the normal mother/daughter misunderstandings to its confusion. All of the daughters, at some point in the book, tell of an instant where their mother's Chinese was impossible to translate into English, because of cultural differences that made it impossible for the daughters to fully understand what their mothers were trying to tell them.  <br /> At first it was confusing which daughter belonged to which mother, but that really doesn't matter, because many of their experiences were based on their similar upbringing and their relations with their mothers. It is interesting how many of the daughters were unfriendly with one another when they shared so much in common. They just couldn't rise above the pettiness in their lives to see this. I was happy when the plot lines tied together and the daughters learned to accept their mothers and learned to be grateful to be their mother's daughter. To me, this love and acceptance was truly the moral of the story. The plot concluded itself by Jing-mei realizing what her mother had given her: her life, her love, and two sisters. What more could she have asked for? <br />

B00000DHRX|5.0|If you're looking for WHAM! forget it, although there is a WHAM BEST OF available seperately. This is all about George Michaels SOLO material, as my header states few can match him-vocally-lyrically he's in a class of his own and this CD will demonstrate that,leaving you in no doubt of the mans ability. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of music at all you will find it hard to dislike this CD. Great ballads,sung with oodles of clarity and class, Jesus To A Child must have had the Sony Exec's pulling their hair out in jealousy, superb. It covers all the bases from his early solo releases like Careless Whisper and A Different Corner to his late 90's stuff like Fastlove and Outside. All in all probably the best collection by one of, if not \\"THE\\" best singers ever to grace the charts.
B0000YWKHC|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the most beautiful and memorible films you are ever going to see. I'm not going to go into details about the plot or explination of the film, that can be viewed from one of the many excellent reviews below. Alot of people don't seem to like this film, and I think that's because they just can't appreciate its realness (there isnt always a plot or dramatic scenes in life, there hardly ever is), or they just couldn't connect with the film. I guess I can understand that. But for those who like out of the ordinary, beautiful, and isolated feelings in film, than you will love this film. The ending is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen, and it's not in the typical sense. Just the sheer emotion is enough to make your heart melt. This film has inspired me to visit Japan, something I hadn't really thought about up until now. An absoulte must for any person who can truely appreciate cinema.
0385507755|1.0|This book is such testimonial bout his author; no truth but a pack of lies. <br />A pathetic teenager brat, who turned into a pathetic Criminal adult, who turned into a con artist! No integrity, no personal honor, no character. <br />A man who is so self absorbed and happy with himself that he only cares about himself. <br />This fabricated book is not worth to be called a memoire and the publisher should know better.

0307276902|3.0|OK...remember when The Blair Witch Project first came out? Everyone thought that was true including me so when I saw the movie...it totally freaked me out. Then the truth came out...not true. Same goes for this book. I don't watch Oprah but a co-worker of mine started reading the book to try and understand her son's addiction and the little she told me about the \\"memoir\\"...intrigued me enough to buy it for myself. I got about halfway thru the book when the truth came out that parts of it were fabricated. Once I learned that....I fought with myself to actually finish the book. Oh yeah...I was dissapointed that this guy's book was \\"embelished\\" and I was wondering if what I'd read thus far had really happened or not and should I waste my time reading the rest not knowing what's REALLY true or not but I prevailed and did finish the book and thought the book was good for it's entertainment rather than it's truthfulness. And of course after watching the Oprah show when she had James Frey back to get \\"the truth\\" and I finally got to hear this guy's version...I personally think he fabricated alot more than he was admitting to on her show. He hemmed & hawed around TOO much with his answers...dodging direct questions (yes or no) with his typical James Frey spin.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is a far more radical film than those who view it as about \\"gay cowboys.\\" In fact, as I argue in [...] its main characters lose interest in what label to put on themselves after a while and simply wish to BE. This is an even more profound lesson than the need to accept homosexuality. It is to not limit one's choices by self-labeling. Regardless of one's beliefs about his or her sexual orientation there may be situatiuons where they find themselves inexplicably drawn to someone that defies these preconceptions. They should allow themselves to experience these <br />\\"out of character\\" moments without self-censorship (e.g., \\"Oh, I'm a _________ I shouldn't be feeling this and wanting that. I will just ignore it and it will go away.\\" It probably will but maybe it shouldn't). <br />

Never rent or buy this movie it is just pure and absolute garbage.
B00009P1O2|4.0|queen is one of the best live acts ever, and this dvd does them justice. the music is fantastic as always, and they really did a nice job with the extras on disk 2. my only complaint (and it is a big one) is with the editing of the live concert footage. the relentless cut-cut-cut-cut style is exhausting to watch and you really don't get to see the band actually *do* much of anything. it's hard as a viewer to get into the performance when it jumps around insanely like that. c'mon, this is freddie mercury we're talking about here - the camera loves the guy, let us see him move more than two steps at a time! to make up for it, the \\"queen cam\\" extras that focus exclusively on each band member are well worth watching - you can see why the world went ga-ga for queen. so my advice is to watch the concert once (just so you can say you've done it), and on replays just crank up the sound and close your eyes and remember queen as they were at their peak.

B00022XOAO|1.0|I'm sure this is a great performance, I own the other available Kleiber recordings of Beethoven's symphonies, in particular the other Orfeo release of the 4th symhony is a sparkling gem.  For some reason Orfeo decided to release this specific Pastoral performance as a \\"copy controlled\\" disc to prevent piracy, unauthorized copy, etc.  Not knowing this, I purchased the item from Amazon but when it arrived in the mail I noticed an icon in the bottom right corner indicated \\"Copy Controlled\\".  THIS ICON IS NOT VISIBLE ON THE PICTURE PROVIDED BY AMAZON CURRENTLY.  On the back it says \\"this CD will not play on PC/Mac.\\"  Many of us these days including myself like to enjoy our music on home computer/iPod etc, not via conventional CD player.  If you only listen to music via computer, this CD will not work.  I've tried uploading pictures front/back of the CD I received for you to review.  I also emailed the Orfeo company for clarification, the response indicates they are taking a hard line with this CD in particular - none of the others I own from them (at least a dozen) are \\"copy controlled\\" - I have no idea why they chose to do so with this one.

B0000CD8A8|5.0|Master Of Puppets (1986.), Metallica's third studio album<br /><br />The Metallica of the 1980's was one of the main defining bands of thrash metal and of the metal genre as a whole. Drawing from influences of bands such as Motorhead and Iron Maiden, Metallica were one of the first bands (along with Metal Church etc.) to pioneer the thrash style. Metallica's excellent first album, 'Kill 'Em All' had a very raw sound to it; you could say it was thrash at it's purest. The masterpiece 'Ride The Lightning' followed in 1984; another album filled with more untamed aggression but noticably more structured than it's predecessor. Following this, the band returned to the studio to work on a follow up album. What emerged from this, in 1986 was 'Master Of Puppets'. The album has gone on to be regarded as one of the defining moments of thrash metal; frequently topping greatest metal album polls. So does the album really live up to it's monstrous reputation?<br /><br />'Master Of Puppets' is an album that succeeds in practically all areas. With this album, the band developed their style further from what was seen in 'Ride The Lightning'. In structural set-up, this album is similar to it's predecessor - Metallica stuck to a formula in that respect. However aside from this, 'Master Of Puppets' progresses the thrash genre into new territory. The album features plenty of lightning fast riffs, as is the norm in thrash, but the band begin to use even more complex styles to their music (something expanded further in '...And Justice For All') and squeeze in plenty of new ideas. All of the songs on 'Master Of Puppets' are long, ranging from 5 to 8 minutes in length but none of the songs ever lose interest or get boring. This is especially due to the number of different riffs the band put into individual songs on this album. It's literally awesome how the band manage to seemlessly interchange riffs in some of the albums songs - just listen to the smooth but still heavy, bone-crunching transitions in songs such as 'Disposable Heroes' and you'll see what I mean! Furthermore, the album also succeeds amazingly with the themes within the songs. Where 'Ride The Lightning' explored themes of death, 'Master Of Puppets' looks at the misuses of power and the iron-fisted control it involves. The band members of Metallica in the 1980's always said they would stick to real life issues in their music and they managed it excellently. It's kind of ironic and sad that in the 1990's they became everything they once laughed at with their later music - just look at the lyrics on 'The Black Album' for example. Anyway, going back to 'Master Of The Puppets', you see an album which has themes ranging from the sacrifice of soldiers to war to the views of an inmate in an asylum. It's facinating stuff and excellently lyrically executed. All four members of the band play out of their skin on the album - there's some fantastic perfomances. What's mostly noticable is firstly Lars Ulrich's drumming, which has even greater presence on this album and secondly James Hetfield's vocals. By the time of this album, he had perfected his trademark growl and his singing is much more powerful than on the earlier work. Kirk Hammett's solos are diverse, fast and explosive throughout and Cliff Burton gives one of the all-time legendary performances on the bass. Sadly though, it would be his last as he tragically died a few months after the album's release.<br /><br />Metallica's magnum opus kicks of with 'Battery'. The Spanish guitar opening gets things going before the crunching guitar riffs burst in. This is one of the fastest songs on the album and is an amazing opener. It has infectious riffs and great lyrics such as 'Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me'. After 5 minutes of full out onslaught, the opener runs into the title track epic. This song has plenty of complex moments but it never gets boring. The interlude is a clever departure from the song's main style and the commanding chorus is very strong and potent. The mysterious opening 'The Thing That Should Not Be' follows. It took me a while to get into the song, but my persistance was worthwhile. The song's dark, foreboding nature is captivating. Next, to end the first half of the album is 'Welcome Home (Sanitarium)'. This is an impressive song, in a similar mold to 'Fade To Black' from 'RTL'. The guitar work is awesome and the lyrics are strikingly powerful, where James Hetfield sings from the viewpoint of an asylum internee, trapped in a world of insanity. The change of pace in the song is great later on also.<br /><br />Then, side 2 of the album kicks off with what is for me, the album's best song in 'Disposable Heroes'. This expressly fast epic has some amazing riffs which all interlock brilliantly. This predominantly anti-war song hits home very strongly. The 'Back To The Front' chorus and crunching guitars are not to be missed. The underrated 'Leper Messiah' follows. The song opens with plodding riffs, with an odd time signature rhythm and a call and response chorus. Then though, the track gathers pace into a fantastic interlude with a great solo from Kirk Hammett and resonating shouts from Hetfield before cleverly decellerating into the original riff. 'Orion' follows. Metallica's instrumentals are by far the most underrated part of their catalogue and this 8 minute work is shows this. The first part of the song features classic Metallica riffs, with powerful bass lines from Cliff Burton. Then though, the song takes an unexpected turn. The next part of the song is then a showcase for all of the band members. A smooth bass line provides the basis for some great Hammett and Hetfield solos before Cliff Burton plays an awesome solo (he makes his bass sound just like a lead guitar!). A phenominal track. Then finally, to finish this classic album, we have 'Damage Inc.'. The song has a sonic, futuristic sounding opening before developing into the fastest song on the album, and one of the best. The riffs are at breakneck speed, the drumming furious and the vocals powerful and aggressive. There's a superb Hammett solos also. This song was so popular amongst fans that the album tour was named after it!<br /><br />'Master Of Puppets' saw Metallica improve even more on their excellent earlier work to come up with another thrash masterpiece. By developing their style in a more complex direction but still maintaining speed and heaviness, the band produced classics in this album and the follow up, 1988's '...And Justice For All'. Sadly though, this was the last Metallica album to feature the 'classic' line up of Metallica due to Cliff Burton's tragic death soon after the album's release. 'Master Of The Puppets' is a definitive album and is a near perfect work. A must for any heavy metal fan's collection; this is Metallica in their golden years.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10ng and potent. The mysterious opening 'The Thing That Should Not Be' follows.

1932100660|5.0|As the reviewer below points out,( refers to the review published June 26, 2008 ) do we really want our government to support a health care system that is largely devoted to expensive and invasive medical procedures, and to putting people on drugs for the rest of their lives? Is the collective funding of an industry that is primarily focused on diagnosing and treating sick people, long-term affordable, or desirable?<br /><br />I also agree with the reviewer below, that part four, \\"Why Haven't You Heard This Before?\\", contains the most intriguing and thought provoking chapters. Including, \\"Science--The Dark Side\\", \\"The 'Science' Of Industry\\", \\"Government: Is It For The People?\\", and \\"Big Medicine: Whose Health Are They Protecting?\\"<br /><br />I attended the 2006 Vegsource Healthy Lifestyle Expo in California, where Dr. Campbell gave the keynote address. At some point in the future, I'd like to find a way to bring his message to my hometown of Peterborough.

1932907009|5.0|Of all the screenwriting books I've read, SAVE THE CAT is one of a bare few that I will keep immediately at hand and dip into frequently. The reason is that it isn't just about the basics of story structure, although what Blake has to say on that is clear and concise. The reason the book is \\"repeatable\\" is that it pours out encouragement from every letter on the page. Blake's engaging enthusiasm about telling stories - and telling them well - provides an energy to any writer who is wrestling with a difficult or cumbersome story. You might not agree with how his points apply to the particular story you are working on, but you would be foolish if you didn't give them some consideration. Give his guidelines a try and you will find that your story comes into clearer focus, that the conflicts will find their proper balance (and not fall into melodrama), and that you might just need to put a little more thought into your thematic issues. This book is very, very useful. <br /> <br />Besides that, it's just a plain fun book to read!
0316234753|5.0|This book is a fantastic gift for a child - or, indeed, anyone who struggles to get started on the road to drawing animals. Emberley takes elementary shapes and shows you how to put them together, step by step, to create stylised but character-filled drawings of animals. His selection is eclectic and the little drawings are great: giraffes,  porcupines, raccoons, wolves, dogs, cats, lions, tigers...! <br /> <br />It'll kick-start a budding artist, break the 'I can't draw anything' mood everyone sometimes finds themseleves in, and is a valuable tool to get kids over the initial inability to draw things that 'look good'. <br /> <br />I love it. I use it every now and then when I need to 'get the gist' of an animal I am trying to capture on paper. It's beautifully simple and effective.
0393327655|5.0|Many years ago, I purchased a book entitled, \\"A Whack On The Side Of The Head.\\" Needless to say, it wasn't. But this book, \\"The End of Faith,\\" is a much-needed \\"whack\\" that made me reconsider many of my ideas about life.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with Mr. Harris' ideas, you will be a better person for having read this book. Sam presents his thoughts very eloquently, and (just like Jesus???) uses parables to help make them clear. And I especially appreciate Sam's subtle, dry, but effective sense of humor.<br /><br />I can tell you precisely the kind of people who make me concerned for the future of America and the world - the people who refuse to read this book, or who brand it as \\"evil\\" because it dares to question religious faith. These are the same people that former president Jimmy Carter lambastes in his new book, \\"Our Endangered Values: American's Moral Crisis.\\" They are rigid, self-righteous, and eager to control the lives of others. They are the people who buy and read the asinine \\"Left Behind\\" series by LaHaye and Jenkins, and who worship the terrorist Jesus portrayed in \\"Glorious Appearing.\\"<br /><br />The so-called religious fundamentalists and neo-conservatives who have seized control of the GOP are offensive to any thinking person - including southern Baptists like Mr. Carter and atheists like Mr. Harris.<br /><br />Enough is enough. America was founded on the principle of separation of church and state. Christian fundamentalism is NOT the answer to Islamic fundamentalism. September 11th was a \\"faith-based initiative.\\" The Iraq war appears to be a \\"faith-based initiative.\\" This kind of warped, destructive faith appears to be reaching critical mass, and if it is not stopped, we are all in a lot of trouble.<br /><br />Did \\"W\\" win the election because people believed that he had better \\"values\\" than John Kerry? No. There is one overwhelming reason that Mr. Bush won a second term: John Kerry was an unbelievably weak candidate. And, he didn't look good on television.

B000002IWH|5.0|I remember the first time I watched THE CROW movie when it came out in theaters and loving the movie, and sadly learning that Brandon Lee's poetic performance was undercut by his premature death. It was an unfair end for such a brilliant performance, and guaranteed had he still been alive to do the sequel, it would have done almost as well as this stellar movie did. The soundtrack almost eclipses the movie itself, but the movie and the music both match. The sound that dominates most of this soundtrack falls into alternative, metal, goth, industrial, and even a touching ode to close the album. <br /> <br />The album opens gracefully with The Cure's \\"Burn\\", an atmospheric and dreamy rock ballad that is about as sentimental as this album gets, and you're going to find most of it teething at your bones. But it's good, because Machines of Loving Grace follows right up with their menacing and airy industrial number \\"Golgotha Tenement Blues\\". Right after that, you've got the hard rock power of \\"Big Empty\\" by Stone Temple Pilots, which suits this soundtrack quite nicely, as does Nine Inch Nails fine rendition of Joy Division's \\"Dead Souls\\". Other noteworthy mentions include Pantera's blistering \\"The Badge\\"; My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult's fast-paced manic energy of \\"After The Flesh\\"; Rage Against The Machine's semi-political jazz-ish rock in \\"Darkness\\"; and Helmet's demo-version feel of \\"Milquetoast\\" which feels live-ish and pounds away. Jane Siberry closes off the album with the hauntingly melodic \\"It Can't Rain All The Time\\", which pulls the album from its heavy rock industrial sound to an atmospheric number that completely lightens and, for girls, may induce tears.  <br /> <br />This soundtrack is one of the best ever created for a  film of such depth and menace. For all the dreary feel and sense pervading the brilliant film, the soundtrack is energetic and a pure rush of the action you'll find in the movie. THE CROW soundtrack is my favorite soundtrack, and for those who enjoyed the movie, it should be yours too.
0385507755|5.0|This book is a very frank look at addiction and the price you pay for it. It was hard to put it down once I started it.
B0002TX4QQ|4.0|The story is well known (given the about of publicity that this book has received) - Kevin Khatchadourian killed seven of his fellow students along with a teacher and cafeteria worker shortly before his sixteenth birthday.  <br /> <br />The book takes the form of a series of letters from his mother, Eva Khatchadourian to her husband, and Kevin's father, Franklin Plaskett about their life together and Kevin's upbringing. In these letters she attempts to make sense of this tragedy and determine her role in it.  <br /> <br />The first half of the book is simply stunning. It is beautifully written in slightly arch prose; the prose as much as the sentiments expressed in the letters seems to capture Eva's character almost perfectly. Eva never liked Kevin; she considered her pregnancy an intrusion and never liked the child, even as a baby. She emerges as slightly unpleasant character (at the very least difficult): she can be selfish, cold and judgemental but she is by no means unsympathetic. <br /> <br />There is a lot going on in this complex book - the exploration of Eva's ambivalence to motherhood during her pregnancy and her lack of maternal feeling is beautifully handled. The use of the epistolary form is very successful. It allows Shriver to tell the story in a roughly chronological order while allowing scope for important digressions; furthermore the use of letters provides great insight into Eva. The approach also asks interesting questions of the reader, most importantly how reliable a narrator is Eva? <br /> <br />For me, the second half of the book is less successful. As the book progresses it becomes more plot driven and I felt that Shriver slightly lost her feel for Eva's voice; she ended up providing an absolute recounting of events rather than Eva's version. Furthermore, while Eva is a beautifully realised character all the other players are simply caricatures: Kevin is the epitome of passive aggressive evil, perfect child Celia merely a cipher and Franklinthe dumb opposite to smart Eva.  <br /> <br />Another problem with the book is the hype that surrounds it - when dealing with Eva's feelings about motherhood it is completely successful but it is not an exploration of what drives schoolboy killers (to be honest the film comedy Heathers probably has more to say on that subject). <br /> <br />Despite all these reservations I still think that this is a fantastic book - beautifully crafted and totally gripping.
B00005JNEW|5.0|I watched this movie thinking, wow my junior and senior year in high school football would make a wonderful movie as well. Then I got to the end of the film and knew that this was a unique story. Have you ever been to a high school football game in Texas? The stadiums there are huge! There is a love for football there and it shines throughout the whole community. This movie just brought us a taste of the love for high school football. As were all home enjoying the NFL it's great to see a film that shows the lead to what may become someone's career. This is definatly something produced by Hollywoods influence, but still makes an awesome film. Tim McGraw as an actor is awesome as well! I'm a sucker when it comes to football movies!
B000BT97AO|2.0|The original tagline of this film has now been revamped. It used to be \\"the story of a girl who runs away from the circus to join the real world\\" but that tag line has now been altered to address the fact that it bore no relation to the film MirrorMask in any respect. I only mention this because so many elements of this movie purport themselves to be something that they simply do not become or have no intention of becoming. So, while Dave McKean visuals are on display in full force here (this film DOES have a couple of the best title design sequences you'll EVER see) the movie lacks those essential qualities that make a movie go: the pace is woefully dreary, the acting, with a few notable exceptions, lingers somewhere between subpar and mediocre, and the visual effects work looks strikingly reminscent of those old CD-ROM computer games like Myst and Seventh Guest. While the script may in fact be good or even excellent, you'll never be able to whiddle through the unbearable FLATNESS of the film to figure that out.    Actually, until I saw this movie, I'd never really considered how flattened all of Dave McKean's graphic design was, but the same crushing of disparate elements into a single layer that makes CAGES so sweet, here crushes the vitality out of what should be open 3-dimensional space. This is a film that doesn't move, doesn't breathe, and doesn't quite feel like a movie. Instead, it feels tight, constricted, overly long, and distinctly un-magical.     This isn't to say that the film is without merits: I applaud much of the intent and there are good brains behind it all, but - at the end of the day - it feels very much like a 2-D graphic designer just up and made a movie without really bothering to learn the ins and outs of entertaining with motion picture.

0743246616|5.0|Great book. Delicious, gourmet recipies. High calories- everything is butter, chocolate, buttermilk etc. but worth the treat once in a while! Who would think cupcakes could be so spe ical?  The cupcakes are one of the famous recipies from the Magnolia Bakery in New York- A++.  I have made quite a few recipies, just got the book a few weeks ago. Banana cake with white choc. and cream cheese icing- excellent.  Everything is superb! I am enjoying the book.
B000002JSN|5.0|15 of the best tracks from the mighty Led Zeppelin. In my mind, the best of Led Zeppelin. I know most people are going to disagree, but I have a few points to show you why this is the best the band ever did. <br /> <br />     I'll start by telling you how it is best.  1) Song writing... Not only is it top notch, the songs are so different from one another. You have your streight ahead song to open the record (Custurd Pie), Heavy slide blues (In My Time of Dying), eastern sounds (Kashmir), late 50's groove (Down by the Seaside). I can go on and on.  <br /> <br />     I loved all of Zep's matrial, but this is the best. Not buying this, would be a crime. I don't know if I can say anything more that others reviewer have not said, so I'll make this short <br /> <br />     BTW, the remaster doesn't sound any better than the orignial, just a little louder <br /> <br />
B00004ST9Q|4.0|very well put together dvd music vidoes. but they were a couple of song she or they leave out. they are \\"one moment in time and  hold me\\" overall it was a good music videos <br /> <br /> <br />jd
0553208845|5.0|\\"Siddhartha\\" changes in a unique way every time that I've read it. It is a wonderful, short and easy read, but don't be deceived by it's simplicity... the ideas Hesse writes about grow far beyond the small size of this book.<br /><br />The first time I read this book I took it mostly as a story about a man who doesn't conform to dogma, which is a common theme in Hesse's books.<br /><br />Hesse was interested in how people forge meaning in their lives, and perhaps this is why he is often considered to be an \\"existential\\" writer. The character Siddhartha excels in everything he does, but despite what other people envision for his life he always needs to seek his own personal path. Instead of taking easy paths that follow other people, he creates challenges for himself... if he can easily be a poor man who doesn't need money, clothing or food, Siddhartha wants to try being a rich business man... just to see what it's like and see what it does to him. And if he is a monk who denies pleasure, perhaps he will try to get laid and become the best lover in India.<br /><br />It's easy to go through life without challenging ourselves, and when we try new things we can see the world in fresh and exciting ways. What happens when something drastic totally shakes up our secure way of thinking and behaving? Siddhartha is a good model for people who like to do things differently, just to see what happens (e.g. eating weird food, quitting your job and becoming a bum for a month, dressing like a woman for a day, dying your hair a ridiculous colour to see how people look at you, skydiving, moving to a country where you don't know the language, etc...).<br /><br />The second time I read this book, I appreciated more subtle things about it. For example, it is kind of nice to read the book as if it takes place over several lifetimes for Siddhartha... like a reincarnation myth. Perhaps Hesse was suggesting that in our existence, we will go through all different types of experiences, and the mere experience of life is the meaning of life. It's very simple to pick up a book by some guru or spiritual Master, and simply follow his rules and live your life exactly as it you are told... it may be more challenging and fulfilling to find your own path and make your own decisions. The ideas Hesse has weaved into the story can be very enlightening but also very subversive, particularly for people who follow any type of spiritual dogma.<br /><br />This book would be excellent for anyone (particularly readers in early high school) who is interested in Eastern philosophy, religion, and nonconformity... young seekers might find this an interesting book that is fun to read, and it is interesting to come back to this book to see how your perspective on it may change as you face different situations in life.es, and the mere experience of life is the meaning of life.

B0000027RL|3.0|OK ok, I have been keeping quiet for a long time now. I have always had a hard time understanding the big deal behind PEARL JAM. I know, I know, you people are already steaming at the forehead thinking to yourselves \\"HOW DARE HE?\\" and I know, that as far as many of you are concerned they were the greatest thing that ever happened to rock, society, and the history of life in general... but I just never really cared about them. I give the debut album TEN three stars, because it ain't bad. It may have a timeless quality to it, but if my baby's mamma tells me one more time about how important these guys were I'm knocking my rating down to a two. Thank You.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|How do I describe this album. Really, anything I say is an understatement. <br /> <br />Well, this album isn't traditional \\"punk\\". It has punk themes, but if you're looking for a \\"White Riot\\" or a \\"Clash City Rockers\\", you won't find it here. What you WILL find is the Clash. <br /> <br />It is impossible to classify the Clash. They were punk, rock, pop, rockabilly, reggae, ska....they were simply the Clash. <br /> <br />This is one of the only albums I have ever listened to and loved EVERY single song. The songwriting is excellent, the music impeccable....hell, even the cover is great.  <br /> <br />As I said, I love every song, but my personal favourites are.......\\"Hateful\\", \\"Brand New Cadillac\\", \\"Spanish Bombs\\", \\"Right Profile\\", \\"Wrong 'Em Boyo\\", \\"Koka Kola\\", \\"The Card Cheat\\" and \\"I'm Not Down\\". Strummer's voice is instantly recognisable and the delivery fits the song perfectly. <br /> <br />Ok, I tried to describe \\"London Calling\\", and after reading what I just typed, it really doesn't justify the album. Just go buy it.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|From   \\"[...]\\" <br /> <br />It's already impressive to listen to their first two albums, but when \\"You only live once\\" opens their third work, you can clearly see that something has changed. It's completely different form everything they have ever done and yet so good! In fact, that's a good question: How can one single band be so amazingly good?? <br /> <br />This album is much deeper than the first two ones. The music sounds better, more diverse and Julian's lyrics are more profound   (a little more depressive in some way). It's clear that they have grown up and when you listen to their songs it feels like they'll never be the same again. I don't know if that's good, but what I know is that they are a brand new band and they made it once and again. You can't be without this album. <br /> <br />TOP 5 \\"FIRST IMPRESSIONS...\\" <br /> <br />- \\"Evening Sun\\" - Possibly the best song they've ever done in their whole career. <br /> <br />- \\"You only live once\\" - Surprisingly good. The lyrics show that Julian is wirting even better than he used to do. <br /> <br />- \\"Electricityscape\\" - It's the proof that they can still do \\"faster\\" songs without sounding repetitive. <br /> <br />- \\"Juicebox\\" - It follows the \\"Reptilia\\" style. Great pop song to put them in the radios. <br /> <br />- \\"Ask me anything\\" - Completely unexpected. Amazing. Even their \\"ballad\\" can be creative and original. This song shows that they aren't just another rock band. They are better than that.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this movie. I had never heard of it when it hit theatres, and found it on Pay Per View. I read the reviews here, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />A good movie, and very immersive and entertaining. There was minimal gore, and even less \\"bad acting\\" as some have said in their reviews. It is fantasy - immersive fantasy - and accomplishes what it should: to take us away to another world where we can get lost.<br /><br />I got lost, and you will too! I would love a sequel.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 72<br /><br />37 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />6 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />9 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />8 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace.

B000002KIE|5.0|\\"The Sex Pistols invented punk!!!!\\"    Erm. Not really.    Ok. So. Now we have that out of the way, I will carry on. John Lydon can't sing. Sid Vicious couldn't play bass. Steve Jones was no Hendrix. And, while an able drummer, comparing Paul Cook to Keith Moon would be stupid. Nonetheless, I love this album. The lyrics are funny as hell...    \\"She was a case of insanity, her name was Pauline, she lived in a tree\\"    And, obviously, they're no John Lennon.    But that doesn't matter, cos the songs are awesome. Yeah, they were pop, but they were great. They only made one album, but that was all they needed. If they had been a strictly pop band, they'd be one hit wonders.     Back to the music. Pretty basic rhythm section, and the guitars aren't too complicated either. What makes them great are Lydon's vocals, and the uncomparable lyrics. As far as vocals go, they are kinda hard to explain, definitely not what you could call \\"singing\\" (not tuneful singing anyway), but it wasn't quite screaming. Fun to listen to though. The lyrics, while pretty juvenile (they were, what, 20-21 in '77?), are quick, pretty witty, and a resonable commentary of England in the late '70s.     They did what no other band would dream of doing. They wrote songs about abortion, abuse, their old record label and a rather scathing anthem about the royal family, all in a light-hearted, fun manner. You know what they said to Bill Grundy. They didn't take themselves too seriously, and neither should anyone else.    Highlights are: \\"Bodies\\", \\"No Feelings\\", \\"Seventeen\\", \\"Pretty Vacant\\" and \\"EMI\\".    Never Mind the Bollocks (possibly the best album title ever) is not for everybody. It's not serious. It's not going to make you cry. It might even offend you. As I previously stated, it is an instant classic. It's worth listening to so you can make your mind up about the hype surrounding them.    If you like this, may I recommended:  Leave Home/Rocket To Russia - Ramones  Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables/Plastic Surgery Disasters - Dead Kennedys  Los Angeles - X  Veni Vidi Vicious - The Hives

0316172324|2.0|Gladwell can write, that's for sure.  It's not often that I can finish 250 pages of utter B.S.  The claim was essentially regressing psychology.  To me, it suggested that anecdotal evidence was often more valid than empirical evidence.  Anyone who has ever studied a science knows that is a rrrrridiculous statement.   <br />     Basically, Gladwell described the remarkable gut instincts of experts of a particular field.  The truth is, he was describing a population of elites, not normal people.  This book was advertised as a book that could be useful and enlightening, but I would say it's more akin to reading Teen People or whatever you may see while standing in the line of the grocery store.  In short, some people are exceptional and different.  I'm so glad I read a whole book to have that illustrated for me over and over and over and over again! <br />     Logically, I have to pan this book because of its lack of pragmatic value, however, it was a somewhat entertaining read.  Some of the experiments described where interesting (although validity was rarely discussed) and the flow of the writing was engaging. <br />    My conclusion is that Gladwell would do well to try a different topic that he is better suited for, and if psychology and cognition is his expertise, then he should stop insulting the reader by glorifying anecdotal evidence
020530902X|4.0|Excellent pocket guide to proper grammar and format for basic writing styles.
B000002UB3|5.0|English sentences ..Japanese.. therefore permit me though it might be unskilled.  <br /> <br /> <br />This work is the last album of BEATLES and medley in the latter half.  <br /> <br />I think that it is only a very good tune, and the highest masterpiece  <br />of Beatles.  <br />
B00003CX5P|4.0|The \\"Phantom Menace\\" discusses the beginnings of the Star Wars universe and their problem with evil droids trying to take over the Republic.<br /><br />The special effects are excellent as is the underwater adventure.<br /><br />The droids are enemies of the Republic, who want to change it and take it over; thereby, enslaving its inhabitants.<br /><br />I rate this movie only 4 stars because the plot is somewhat lackluster, and the movie isn't long enough.<br /><br />However, on a positive note, while the plot is relatively simplistic and short, the special effects and the characters are both memorable and excellent.<br /><br />Bottom-line: The actors did a great job acting, but the movie needed a more complex plot and needed to be longer. Instead, it's rather short and leaves you wanting more excitement and adventure.<br /><br />*Highly recommended for anyone over 13 due to violence.

B00005ATQF|5.0|This is a classic that deserves to be in Widescreen on DVD OOOH-RAH!
B0000047EC|5.0|Deep and sofisticated music of two distinctive artists. One of the best CD's to be on the special jazz selections.
B0002KVUKW|4.0|Ok, when I saw this movie in theaters, it blew me away.  I loved the special effects, and the storyline was much better than many action/horror movies today.  I think Hugh Jackman was a good choice to play Van Helsing, but his character did not portray the originality of Van Helsing in Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\".  They also changed his name for some reason.  It was supposed to be \\"Abraham\\" but Sommers changed it to \\"Gabriel.\\" Van Helsing should have also been portrayed as more of a scientist than a gunfighter, which was how Van Helsing was originated. <br /> <br />In this movie, Van Helsing's main nemesis is Dracula, but along the way he fights Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, and some werewolves.  His job is to kill Dracula before he lets lose all of his kids to take over the world. Of course, Helsing is armed with way-ahead-of-his-time weapons which are funded by a secret Vatican society.  That is the tree trunk of the storyline, but of course there are many more branches of obstacles throughout the movie. <br /> <br />As in all movies, some of the fight scenes are very unrealistic.  Such as when \\"whats her name\\" is thrown against the wall at full speed and she gets up just fine.  Just little glitches here and there, but nothing to ruin a pretty good movie.  <br /> <br />Overall, it's a good movie, but check out Sommer's \\"The Mummy\\" which is his best movie.  ENJOY! <br /> <br />John
B000BW7QX6|4.0|Lots of action, kind of strange.  Held your attention.  Will need to view again, to try to understand a few parts.  Since I have never seen the series, there are a few areas that were not 100% clear.  Great entertainmetn.  Good special effects, overall.

0307276902|4.0|I didn't read this book because of Oprah, and in fact would have avoided it had I known it was going to end up being an \\"Oprah book club selection\\" -- we generally don't have the same tastes.   <br /> <br />Had this book been released as a fictionalized account of a true story it would be no less successful, compelling, or worthy.  It's not a subject matter that I would normally be even vaguely interested in.  But as this book came across my desk to be cataloged (I work as a cataloging librarian) and I skimmed it's pages to check that my classification was appropriate,  I was caught by it's style.  It's a bold and raw writing style that connects with you immediately.  It's also one of the best books that I have read lately.  I am sorry that this great writer felt the need to lie about the content of what he produced.  I am further sorry that Ms. Winfrey apparently felt that the book's worth was dependent on it's verbatim truth.  To me, in a sense, it becomes an even more interesting read knowing that it's not the relating of actual fact, but the creation of a \\"can't put it down\\" story by a new and talented writer.   <br /> <br />I personally don't care if the book is fiction or nonfiction.  I think that we might concede that many if not most memoirs would not likely pass the \\"gospel truth\\" test.  I find it somewhat a tempest in a teapot, though I hope that everyone -- from author, to the publishers to Ms. Winfrey have learned something from this experience.  I will read Mr. Frey's follow-up book -- \\"My Friend Leonard\\" for it's likely high quality of writing; and, it's likely ability to hold and capture my interest.  I hope that he is given the chance to write more fiction, in spite of the previous error of his ways.
0060899190|5.0|This book really is quite amazing.  To have a book full of other people's fears, secrets and wishes.  It's almost incomprehensible.  Although very deep and dark, its also very humorous and intelligent.  Artistic and overwhelming at times, this book should be a must-read for everyone.  Let yourself discover things you might not have ever thought of.
B00005JOIF|5.0|Well, you can't argue with success.  I saw \\"Munich\\" a couple weeks ago and thought it was such a powerful film that I instantly declared it to be both the best movie of the year and Steven Spielberg's best movie since \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  Alas, the opinion of a lowly history-studying college student means little.  As of today, \\"Munich\\" has only grossed $40 million and is shaping up to be one of the biggest commercial flops of Spielberg's career.  By contrast, \\"Big Momma's House 2\\"- the wretched sequel to the already unfunny original- grossed nearly as much in its first three days of release.  Hence why I continue to comment on Americans' love of mediocrity. <br /> <br />Why has \\"Munich\\" debuted to such a mixed reaction?  It is admittedly a difficult film to watch.  So was \\"Schindler's List,\\" but \\"Munich\\" is admittedly less of a milestone, and hence is lacking the publicity it would need to still pull people in.  However, this is still a fast-paced, well-acted, and powerful piece of cinema, and for those reasons alone is a good way to spend two and a half hours (that just breeze by).  However, it is also a frighteningly timely warning about the dangers and moral ambiguities that inevitably accompany a war on terrorism, and how quickly simple vengeance can devolve into borderline murder. <br /> <br />Spielberg has not been this focused in a long time- none of his 00's work approaches the quality seen here (with the exception of \\"Catch Me if You Can,\\" which was much lighter fare).  Eric Bana gives the best performance of his career as a man who is friendly and righteous at first but who is quickly consumed by paranoia and the guilt of ignoring his conscience (and this is coming from someone who also loved him in \\"Hulk\\" and \\"Troy\\").  Daniel Craig seethes fury beneath a calm exterior.  Geoffrey Rush proves that, in spite of his familiarity now, he can still blend into any role with ease.  The rest of Bana's team are given compelling back stories, and all struggle to conform their moral compasses with the assassin work they're given.  There are scenes here I will never forget- a desparate attempt to save the life of a child suddenly caught in the way of an assassination attempt, the brutal revenge murder of a woman, the scenes of a man making love to his wife while also being unable to stop thinking about the murder of the Israeli athletes at Munich.  From the opening scenes, \\"Munich\\" grabs you and never lets go (if you'll forgive that cliched expression, it's appropriate here). <br /> <br />More than any other movie this year, \\"Munich\\" made an impression psyche that no amount of box office indifference in the world can change.  It aspires to be something more than entertainment, and it succeeds on nearly every level.  Here's hoping that it has a \\"Fight Club\\"-like fate and finds its audience on DVD.
B000AP04FG|4.0|This was a good action movie with some humor thrown in.
0684853523|5.0|This is Stephen King's 2nd non-fiction book, the first one being \\"Danse Macabre\\", which was first published in 1981. I haven't read 'Danse Macabre'(don't really plan to either)but I don't need to read it in order to know that this book is not only Stephen King's best non-fiction book out of the two, but one of his top 10(or 15)best of all time. And he has a lot of books, too. 50 or more, I believe.  To put it basically, the title speaks for itself.       \\"On Writing.\\"  It's a book, \\"On Writing.\\"   In the first section of the book, Stephen King talks about his life from when he was a small boy, and all kinds of hilarious things that happen to him in between, and to when he grows into a 'man', and gets his first book, Carrie, published by Doubleday. Mainly, it's not an autobiography, the author claims, but a way to show the reader, \\"how a writer was shaped into the writer he is today.\\" Like quoted from the book: \\"A writer can be formed, but not made.\\"  In the following sections is where he begins talking about the art and craft of writing, more specifically his craft, fiction writing. It doesn't scan upon such writing topics like non-fiction or essay writing or report writing(and if those types of writing are what you are hoping to excel upon, this book is not for you--try something like \\"Writers Inc.\\" they have everything, from 'how to write a book review' to 'story writing' to 'poem writing' or 'how to write a report' and many more)--only on his craft, fiction writing--but it does go over a very small section on non-fiction, the report of a basketball game which would be published in his school newspaper(since he was back then, a writer for his school newspaper/s)but it's only a paragraph, from the first draft and after some minor cuts and editing, so it can't be counted as much. Mostly fiction, like I said.        He goes over such topics in good fiction writing like: Dialogue attribution, character development, good story(or a situation--Stephen doesn't like and believe in 'plot')pace, theme, symbolism, drafting, editing, revising and much more. For example, he says adverbs(heartily, peacefully, quietly, slowly, quickly--words mostly ending in 'ly')are in most cases, useless and horrible, and only add to the story's dullness, deadwood, and slowness, also thinking that only popular commercial writers who only care for their money and want to cheat their way through their books, only use adverbs.  Or, he says that the passive verb is bad and should be avoided at most times, and that the active verb is much better and should be used more oftenly(Passive Verb: The rope was thrown by John, Active Verb: John threw the rope. See how much the active verb is?).  He also gives pratical advice to the beginning writer, like: \\"If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or the tools to write.\\"   \\"If you want to be a good writer, you must do two things above anything else: read a lot and write a lot.\\"  And much more.  In the next following sections, he goes threw his rendevouz with a truck that hit him, almost killing him, and his hospital time, his struggles to write, and so on, and in the 2nd to last section, he specifically goes over editing and revising.  For the example, he uses a few incepting pages from one of his short stories(which appears in the audio collection: \\"Blood and Smoke\\" and also in his most recent short story collection, \\"Everything's Eventual\\")1408. He shows the reader the first draft of the first few pages of the story, and then how it reads after it is edited and revised.  As he states: \\"The first draft of a story is like a person standing in front of a mirror with only his socks and boxers on, and after the heavy editing and revision coming from the following drafts, is when the person starts putting on his 'out' clothes, putting on his shoes, putting on his watch, combing his hair, maybe even putting on a hint of cologne as well---when he is finally ready to face the world.\\"  Finally, in the lastsection, which is the shortest of them all, only consisting of a few pages, he gives a list of the top 100 books that he read in the last 3 - 4 years which he recommends you to read. Which he says, \\"will change the way you write--if not, entertain you, for they certainly did for me.\\"  Everything from \\"As I Lay Dying\\" by William Faulkner, to \\"Hocus Pocus\\" by Kurt Vonnegut, to \\"The Poet\\" by Michael Connelly, to \\"Heart of Darkness\\" by Joseph Conrad, and many more.  And when I finally read the last book and the author it was by, turning the page to only find white, blankness; knowing that the book has finally ended, I was sad. I was very sad. It was such a good book, still is of course, and it has finally ended. But like the saying goes, \\"All Good things must come to an end.\\" I suppose so. But still the memory and the soul of the book still remains in my memory and soul. Like the front flap of the book says, \\"It will empower and entertain everyone who reads it.\\" That is 100 percent true, without one doubt at all. This book has left me mind-blown, more wiser, more stronger with insight, \\"empowered and entertained\\", with a heightened sense of admiration and respect towards the author, and I know, if you read it, it will leave you the same way too.

0140177396|4.0|Set in the 30's, right after the Great Depression, Of Mice and Men, takes place in Salinas, California, mainly circling around 2 field laborers, Lennie and George.  They are the complete opposite. Lennie is gigantic, like a huge gorilla, but has the mind of a kid. While Lennie, is rather short, and 'dark of face', seemingly 'sculpted precisely.' The 2 may seem to make a very unlikely, and dysfunctional pair, but in fact, they are reasonably good friends, but at times, argue a lot. Maybe at the fact of Lennie being a bit retarded, for when he was only a young kid, he got his head banged real hard on something.  But either way, they cling to each other, in the ugly face of alienation and loneliness. They get work when they can, for they have a grand plan. To own a few acres of their own land. The whole package. Have their own log cabin, a vegetable field, a cage for the rabbits, for Lennies loves those rabbits, generally their own land they can roam freely upon without hesitation or reluctance or fear.  But when they start working around Salinas, for the boss of the son of a guy named 'Curley' whos only bent on giving George and Lennie, especially Lennie, a hard time, their dream, now really appearing to be merely a dream, begins crumbling before their eyes. It is within their posession; their grasp of harnessing and achieving. But when it is all said and done, not even George can prevent Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things he firmly taught him to follow, nor the seductive grace of a beautiful woman--Curley's wife.    This was my first John Steinbeck book that I have read and finished, and for deciding to pick the book up and read it in the first place, I am very glad for that. After finishing it, I was granted with a heightened sense of admiration and respect toward the author, and I plan to read many more of his books. Read this book--not only for entertainment and insight into things, not to mention that A grade in your English class, if you ever happen tostumble on having to read this book or having a mandatory book report assigned on it--but also for the heightened sense of love for literature and admiration and respect towards the author, which this book gave me, and I gurantee, will also give you if you read it.

B000003TA4|3.0|I was never really into nirvana. They are too depressing, I meean they have some good melody and tunes....but in truth it's kurt's death that makes them still popular among young adolescents. Probably cause every young kid wants to commit suicide but they are too afraid to do it, so they look upon someone who did.....hence kurt cobain. It's funny how he claims he hated fame and it killed him, but then why make a video for mtv and then perform on corporate mtv, unless you want it. What makes it more lame is when he said in his suicide \\"it's better to burn out than to fade away,\\" because it makes him look like he was afraid of evolving and would fade out like alice in chains( personally think a far superior band.)And this album is overrated, it has some good tunes, a couple...but I'm not really a fan of anything controlled or performed by mtv.territorial pissing is all right, but as long as there are kids who are depressed and later end up getting over it, there will always be nirvana....WTF!
068484267X|1.0|Was my copy the only one without punctuation? Attention to little details such as qutaion marks makes any story more readable. I am far from being a grammar Nazi, and can usually forgive minor things. But perhaps that is because I have read many a 12 year olds online fanfiction stories that have more flow and better grammar than Frank McCourt's writing does. <br /> <br />I felt so little pity for the mother who seemed to be constrained by her religious beliefs that a mother should stay home, out of the work force but had no problem having a `knee trembler' with a man she had just met that night. If she were brave and bold enough to take that type of risk, why did she not try to find work of her own? It was far from unheard of, especially in New York City in 1938. I have read far to many and have personally known many people who have found themselves in similar situations but instead of fleeing from place to place, they picked themselves up and did what it took to make life bearable, most even made life better. <br /> <br />How was it that the extended family members able to send money for cross Atlantic travel, but could not find the resources to help the struggling family once they reached Ireland? <br /> <br />I am sorry, but all I can see are the mistakes in this story. Mr. McCourt, please do the Irish a favor and stop writing. You are doing harm to their long held and greatly earned reputation as great story tellers and writers. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000894RZ|5.0|This is, by far, one of the best Compilation CDs I've heard in a long time. Lisa Stansfield has amazed me with her talent, ever since the release of \\"Affection\\" back in '90. I went shopping recently in the music store and came across \\"Biography\\" as a surprise. Having been unaware of its release, I decided to \\"put it in the bank\\" with my other upcoming purchases. 2 days later, I bought it on amazon and I don't regret it one bit. My copy is a promo, but it's got the same booklet and images as the publicly released edition.<br /><br />I really like the photos of Lisa, although most of them are small thumbnails, except for 2 larger ones. Her face is beautiful and she's changed quite a bit in the past 15 years. My, has it really been that long? There are some nice little tidbits about Lisa's songs, inside the booklet. What you won't find are the lyrics, though. The interior of the booklet is white and well-designed. Simple and straight-forward and not distracting to the eye. Additionally, the disc itself is white. The recording appears to have been remastered, which makes listening all the better. Arista is a great Label. Most of the tracks are new to me...as I've only bought the \\"Affection\\" CD since discovering Lisa Stansfield. Considering \\"Someday (I'm coming back)\\" was on the \\"The Bodyguard\\" soundtrack...it's nice to find it here.

B000B9EY2U|4.0|Back in the day I was the biggest DM fan in town.  I listened to all five of their albums over and over again.  Then the big hit People are People came out.  It was over.  Pop music had caught up with Depeche Mode.  I went to see them live on that tour and was shocked to see them not acting like the cerebral techno artists that they sounded like.  David Gahan was jumping around the stage like Michael Jackson.  I moved on to more experimental bands. I didn't lose track of them I just didn't take them seriously anymore. Spin the clock ahead 20 years and I see them on Fuse TV looking very much their age and missing Alan Wilder.  (He is now doing Recoil, check him out)  They played the video for Precious.  I was astonished.  They had been broken.  The \\"Music for the Masses\\" mentality was gone.  I bought the album right away.  I was so glad to hear music made by an older, wiser DM.  They seem to realize that they have enough money and now they can go back to using their talents and not worry about making a hit record.  I rank this new album up there with the first five.  It is the record that should have come after Black Celebration.  The last half of the eighties and the whole nineties decade were just a bad DM dream. (Okay, Violator was pretty good) but other than that they were just another pop band. The only thing that might make them better now is to bring back in Vince Clark.  Wouldn't that be something?  P.S. Be careful buying the import with the DVD.  Mine is in PAL and will not play on my TV's NTSC DVD player.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|As a would-be anglophile, I certainly agree with the previous glowing reviews of this BBC presentation.  It too, for me, is one of the best (if not the best) BBC miniseries that I've ever seen and I have seen many.  What I love the most about this series is that it shows the \\"class struggle\\" at all levels whether it is social status, geographical status (from what area a person is from or what local they might inhabit) employment level status (worker, employer) etc.-(I'm still of the strong opinion that it still DOES matter no matter where one might live) Anyway, this presentation does a wonderful job of showing the class differences in England mid-1800.  The acting is simply superb by a huge cast; however, I must single out a few of my favorites.      Richard Aarmitage plays the moody mill owning Thornton.-what a wonderful character very much like Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". He's a dark, brooding, handsome and seemingly not too nice man; however, in actuality he is a very good man.   Aarmitage turns in a fantastic performance on the level of Colin Firth (as Mr. Darcy) in Pride and Prejudice.   Daniela Denby-Ashe, as Margaret the heroine of the story and Thornton's love interest, is marvelous as one of those very strong \\"Jane Austin type of women\\"   Thornton's haughty but basically good mother is played wonderfully by Sinead Cusack.  I also love Tim Piggot-Smith (in more of a subdued role for him) as Mr. Hale, Margaret's father.  To be honest all of the actors are great in this presentation.      This miniseries exhibits great direction along with a great script.  The recreation of the era and local is marvelous.  I love the cotton mill scenes with the machines roaring and cotton dust flying all over the place-fabulous. (The final scene in the train station is one you'll always remember--it's heart tugging!!)     If you want to be well entertained and love great acting, a great story, great direction and great recreation of an era gone by, buy this disc-believe me, you'll love it.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is one of Queen's best CD's ever. 'A Night At The Opera' 1975.  The first time I heard this CD it was on vinyl.  But I was too young to really appreciate the songs on this CD.  I added this CD to my collection in 2003. However, prior to acquiring this CD the only song I had really heard was 'Bohemian Rhapsody'....due, in large part, to the movie 'Wayne's World' which made this classic song popular once again among listeners.  Other favourites on this CD are 'Death On Two Legs', 'Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon' and the haunting 'The Prophet's Song'.  To get the full effect of this song, listen to it with headphones on.
B000002KLG|5.0|By 1980 George Benson was at the apex of his career with a truckload of grammies and legendary instumental recordings under his belt (ONE OF WHICH IS THE UBIQTIS \\"BREEZIN\\") it was only natural that he join forces with another artist who was also at a point of high status Quincy Jones who at this time besides exploring the world of both jazz, pop, and movie scoring (not to mention the coutless number of artist he has worked with) he was making a name for himself as a top notch R&B producer as well...this was the era of \\"OFF THE WALL \\"MASTERJAM\\" \\"THE DUDE\\"...etc etc...and so it is with this release of \\"GIVE ME THE NIGHT\\"....from the jazz of\\"MOODY'S MOOD\\" to the funk of the title track this album has Quincy written all over it but Q's production is not smothering to the point of self indulgence..he's letting George have enough room to let loose and cover all his bases. <br /> <br />A truly gifted work from two gifted beings.
B00005UJOJ|4.0|1970. Black Sabbath's debut CD and they come out rockin'. I don't like Ozzy but I do like the Sabbath stuff. And this CD is classic Black Sabbath. The first track, which is the title track, excellent way to open the album with the rain and the bell tolling at the beginning. This sets the mood for the rest of the album. And of course two other classics N.I.B. and The Wizard. <br />
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|Mamoru Oshii brings Shirow's sci-fi thriller to life with such vision and power, one can't help but be intranced from the very first moments.  The movie is hands down incredible.

This is a must buy, especially if you don't already own the movie.

B0002OERI0|1.0|I have been a fan of Green Day for many years, and they were always one of my favorite bands. But when American Idiot came along, I was very dissapointed. I only liked a couple songs on this album at first. Then, MTV and the radio played songs from this album CONTSANTLY. Every little poser who only likes music they see on MTV is a huge \\"fan\\" of Green Day, probably not even knowing that they have other, much better, albums. Green Day sold out. Also, some of the songs I actually did like, such as Holiday, I now HATE because MTV played their videos every waking minute of every bloody hour. MTV sucks and so do Green Day now!

0316172324|3.0|The premise of this book is that accurate decisions often can be made without an abundance of data, and that in many situations, too much data and analysis actually hampers the ability to make an effective decision. In particular, Gladwell posits that persons with an expertise in a specialized area of concern often develop a keen sense for making quick decisions, a concept Gladwell refers to as \\"thin-slicing\\".  At it's best, the book is well-written, evokative, and entertaining with its myriad examples and anecdotes.  But at it's worst, we are left with merely a \\"common sense\\" awareness that experts can (and often should) rely on their \\"gut feelings\\" about situations within their specific realm of expertise. Reading this book left me asking \\"so what?\\" and wishing for practical information about how persons like you and I can develop skills to take advantage of thin-slicing.  I think this work would have been more revealing if Gladwell had gone on to apply how concepts such as situational awareness can be used to enable persons to develop better perceptions of their environment and thus develop thin-slicing skills of their own.  More information about situational awareness can be found at: <br />[...]

B000000W5N|5.0|No rock collection could be complete without Sticky Fingers! The most popular tracks are Sister Morphine, Dead Flowers, and Wild Horses, but the whole album is a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned! My favorites are You Gotta Move with it's strange sleezy acoustic guitars, B**h which has a fun orchesta sound behind it making it one of the more fun songs on the album, Sister Morphine is about heroin but it's still one of my favorites! Wild Horses could be the best, and prettiest song on here, and Can't You Here me knocking is one of the jammiest, and funkiest songs the Stones ever made! But the whole album is is amazing and it ranks right up there with Exile In Main Street(Their most popular, as far as I know)! So please, make sure you buy this album, no collection is complete without Exile On Main Street, Sticky Fingers, Dark Side Of The Moon, Who's Next?, and Ok Computer. Those albums belong in every rock collection.<br /><br /> I hope the Rolling Stones never stop rockin'!
B000002J0P|5.0|In a nutshell, that's it.   Vocal, songwriting, and spiritual harmony.  On one hand, it's selfless- every tiny aspect of this record compliments another in a holistic fashion.   On the other, like a Monet, it's impressionistic- each song represents a shade, a sonic timbre, which effortlessly meshes with its neighbors to present the most complete range of human emotions ever committed to record.   The keyword there is \\"effortless\\"- \\"free and easy, the way it's supposed to be\\".   This is the free-est sounding record out there.   To achieve this, David Crosby, Graham Nash, and Stephen Stills broke all the rules.    <br /> <br />   \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" is the first suite in the history of folk or rock 'n' roll and still stands unmatched in terms of sheer expression.   Traveling through the mind of a heartbroken romantic, you can feel the helplessness in Still's voice when he practically screams, \\"can I tell it like it is, but listen to me baby- it's my heart that's a-suff'rin', it's a-dyin'.\\"   It's the foundation of \\"Helplessly Hoping,\\" the most vocally moving peice, and comes to a climax on \\"49 Bye-Byes,\\" my favorite song.   Why doesn't anyone know this tune?!?    It's beyond me.... <br /> <br />Nash is Stills' lighthearted romantic equivalent.  All of Nash's tunes are delightfully simple and pure, a welcome break from Stephen's intensity and Crosby's excess.   Just because they're lighthearted, they shouldn't be discredited, though!   Personally, Nash is my favorite of the triumverate and songs like \\"Marrakesh Express\\" and \\"Pre-Road Downs\\" prove it.   Those two psychadelicly tinged tunes definitely hold their own against bandmates' tunes.   \\"Lady of the Island,\\" though, is unmatched- it stirrs up every desirous and wooing sentiment inside of you...simply BEAUTIFUL.  One reviewer also noted that Graham's voice ties the record together- ABSOLUTELY.   Dave may be the angel, Stephen the soulful singer, but Graham has the most perfect pitch I've ever heard.   Plus, whoelse could hit those high notes? <br /> <br />Then come David's numbers.    Admittedly, many of Crosby's songs have taken a while for me to digest, since they tend to be wandering and excessive.  Not \\"Guinevere\\".   Not \\"Wooden Ships.\\"   Not \\"Long Time Gone.\\"   Two of these are very soulful, one is very delicate- talk about covering the spectrum!    <br /> <br />But, ultimately, it doesn't matter who wrote what.   What counts is all three shared a vision of earthiness.   THAT'S what keeps the record together.   Just as the album cover reveals three friends in a rustic setting, so too does the album display three visionaries creating the most acoustic, wooden, and organic music.   Unfortunately, the addition of Neil Young killed this vibe- it became a battle of the egos.   Despite strong songs, the album suffered from a lack of flow- a lack of vision.   Thank GOD this came first! <br /> <br />Listen to it.   Re-listen to it.   LIVE by it. <br /> <br />
0060734191|5.0|For those of you who feel that dragons, unicorns, and bards are a bit overdone nowadays, this fantasy trilogy offers up a heroine who binds the dead with a bandolier of bells. The Geography of Death is lovingly delineated, from the prologue where Sabriel is born and dies and is rescued from the First Gate of Death by her father, to the third book in the trilogy, where the new Abhorsen braves Death in the form of a river, a waterfall, pools of black water, strange currents that suck the spirit from the flesh.<br /><br />Sabriel herself is an English schoolgirl, recently graduated from Wyverley Academy with a \\"first in English, equal first in Music, third in Mathematics, seventh in Science, second in Fighting Arts and fourth in Etiquette. She had also been a runaway first in Magic...\\" A visitation from the Dead sends Sabriel on a quest through the magical Old Kingdom, in order to reunite her father's body with his spirit which is trapped within the Fourth Gate of Death. She has to do battle with a really nasty necromancer-Adept, and rescue a prince who is a bit of a figurehead at first but who finally develops into a memorable character in his own right.<br /><br />Sabriel is both helped and hindered by a very non-cuddly cat named Mogget.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" is the middle book this remarkable fantasy series.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles Nix's immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads \\"The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting\\", and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br /><br />However, \\"Lirael\\" isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br /><br />\\"Abhorsen\\" is a direct continuation of \\"Lirael,\\" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Loved the Movie \\"Serenity\\".  Did not think \\"Firefly\\" four disc TV series set, could compete, much less match or surpass movie, but \\"Firefly\\" does just that.  After just the first lead-in episode, the wife and I were addicted: hook, line, and sinker.  How can you resist likeable, rightly cast characters, a haunting lead-in song for each episode, and that other-worldly, yet familiar, wild-west, chinese-zen, outer-space motif.  Quickdraw, gun-slinging Captains, stow-away Psychics, Consorts and Priests, are just part of the mix. The chemistry works. Enjoy!
0895260131|5.0|Our educations, ALL of our educations, suffer from a narrow perspective and the pressures of whatever the prevailing political orthodoxy happens to be. This book explodes the cuddly ecumenical world view that is STILL in fashion that all monotheists are but different shades of the same color.     In assessing the nature of Islam William Gladstone put it best: \\"They [Muslims] were, upon the whole, from the black day when they first entered Europe, the one great anti-human specimen of humanity. Wherever they went, a broad line of blood marked the track behind them, and, as far as their dominion reached, civilization disappeared from view. They represented everywhere government by forces opposed to government by law.\\" And this was said BEFORE the slaughter of 100's of thousands by the Turks in the TWENTIETH century.    The myth of the \\"moderate\\" Muslim is a diabolical politically correct canard forged on the anvil of \\"tolerance\\". And to the extent that we've accepted this monstrous invention we've allowed ourselves to become denuded and emasculated. That we still allow ANY Muslim to immigrate to this country is a testimony to our failure to understand the problem and a failure of will to solve this crisis.    Make no mistake, Islam is a best understood as a hate cult with the capacity to destroy civilization. William Durant in his \\"The Story of Civilization\\" succinctly stated, [Islam is] \\"probably the bloodiest story in history.\\" He called it a \\"discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex order and freedom can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without and multiplying from within.\\" The bitter lesson, Durant concluded, was that \\"eternal vigilance is the price of civilization. A nation must love peace, but keep its powder dry.\\"    Indeed, man's grasp on civilization is tenuous. It takes but one generation to separate men from their past. And men cut adrift from the certitudes and accumulated wisdom of the generations that have gone before are highly susceptible to the centrifugal forces of chaos. This elaborate edifice that we can the modern world could easily fold in the face of a committed enemy particularly in light of the fact that by nearly all measurements the West has lost its will.    Sir Winston Churchill said:  \\"How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensual ism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men.    \\"Individual Muslim's may show splendid qualities. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen: all know how to die. But the influence of the religion paralyzes the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science - the science against which it had vainly struggled - the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.\\"     Alexis de Tocqueville said the following:  \\"I studied the Koran a great deal. I came away from that study with the conviction there have been few religions in the world as deadly to men as that of Muhammad. So far as I can see, it is the principal cause of the decadenceso visible today in the Muslim world and, though less absurd than the polytheism of old, its social and political tendencies are in my opinion to be feared, and I therefore regard it as a form of decadence rather than a form of progress in relation to paganism itself.\\"    Today we are told that what is needed in the Middle East is democracy.  This has become our mantra.  But as \\"Spengler\\" from the Asia Times recently said, \\"Something more than democracy is required for peace and prosperity, and that is a people committed to good rather than evil. Democracy in the Middle East means something quite different: Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Muqtada al-Sadr in Iraq. The sooner President Bush changes the subject, the better.\\"     It would be impossible for this or any book to suffer from overstatement insofar as the pernicious designs of Islam are concerned.
B00000ICD9|5.0|I watched this movie last night wow this is not your run of the mill stories but, actually has some insight. it has a feel as if the love and understanding of god was in this movie. god speakes to us in many ways. this was one of them. do not fear life or death. the only thing that dies is the body. to know this is to be free.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Unless you've heard every album put together by Opeth, then you <br />truly haven't heard it all. Unlike some bands who sound exactly the same every album, Opeth keeps producing incredible new music <br />that sounds different between albums but still sounds like Opeth. <br />Another must have album for any metal lovers.
0684857219|4.0|We are trying to create a workout plan for middle aged folks. We bought this book for it's completeness, which it is. However, this is really for bodybuilders, not for folks looking for a variety of exercises to stay fit. I will say, even that info is there, but is hidden among the photos of champion bodybuilders. Maybe we should have realized this, but we are new to this whole concept. Just make sure you know what you are buying...not Arnold's fault!
B000301YY8|5.0|I first heard James Blunt on VH1. He was introduced as one of the new artists to look out for. After seeing the Video for \\"Your Beautiful\\", I could not get the song out of my mind. Back to Bedlam is a great CD from a talented new Artist. James Blunt has a talented singing voice that adds depth and soul to his music. Once you have listened to James Blunt's soulful singing, he stays with you long after you have turned off the CD player. If you enjoy Elton John then you will like James Blunt.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Thoroughly entertaining all the way through. Deliberately campy at times, but overall a pretty good flick.<br /><br />The $20 question is: Is this movie worth the price of purchase versus a rental? Let's see:<br /><br />-Two big stars...Matt Damon (plays Will...no not Good Will in this one) and Heath \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" Ledger (Jake).<br />-A great plot line...Will and Jake are con-artists that execute Scooby-Doo style pranks on various communities, but meet their match when they encounter a genuine fairy-tale curse and are commissioned to vanquish it.<br />-Many snippits of the famous Brothers Grimm tales are cleverly woven into the movie (The Gingerbread Man, Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Snow White, Hansel and Gretel, etc).<br /><br />But clearly director Terry Gilliam was torn between putting out a PG or a PG-13 movie. The deliberate silliness that I mentioned earlier, especially the portrayal of Cavaldi by the great character actor Peter Stormare (you know, the guy that sticks Steve Buscemi in the wood chipper in Fargo) takes away from any attempt at serious that the movie had. And all of the fairy tale references suggest that a movie for kids may have once been in mind.<br /><br />But genuinely frightening and nightmarish images were too much for the ratings guys at the MPAA and they threw the 13 on the end of the PG to make sure that our children were kept safe from the make believe fairy tale world of The Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />So back to the $20 question. This movie is not a keeper. It is, however, an excellent rental. Let kids watch it? That's up to you, parents, knowing that the MPAA says anyone under 13 may be damaged from viewing this picture about the Brothers that created stories for kids to scare kids.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This album sounds just like Fallout Boy.  Is that a problem?  Only a little bit.  Yes the lead singer sounds like the lead singer for Fallout Boy, but that just means he's a phenomenal singer.  Yes the music sounds like Fallout Boy with synths and sampling.  Not exactly original, but it implements a good idea.  These days it's hard to be original but at least these guys play something with some style.  Hooky guitars, and catchy lyrics may make this band \\"Fallout Boy pt. 2\\", but they still rock.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|The movie was okay. I should have rented it first, then I would have saved myself the purchase price minus the rental fee. Live and learn! <br />                     Shae Leonard
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Great movie, the special features are very interesting. Better thyan the previous DVD version because the story is divided into chapters, you can easily choose the story you want to see.
0307276902|1.0|I found this book unbelievable...and in light of the recent press, it turns out it was.
B000009QO6|5.0|This album is a combination of blues, punk, psychedelic, thrash, and mixed with death metal elements. Glenn Danzig, the former leader of the punk legends The Misfits, reinvents his style as a darker and heavier sounding singer. The classic lineup of Danzig consisted of guitarrist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von and drummer Chuck Biscuits. Their debut album was produced by legendary producer Rick Rubin which you can tell that he did put his touches on it because of the great production this albm has. Danzig's voice can be described as Jim Morrison gone satanic, very melo blues like tone and dark. Every song has its own characteristical element from the famous single Mother, to a jazzy range of the She Rides, Twist of Cain and Am I Demon. Overall this album consisted of great riffs and solos, crunchy, funky basslines, and top rank drumming along with Danzigs melodic singinng style. If you want to start, start here and Danzig 3. Enjoy.
B000B8QG0O|3.0|O.K., so somepeople might not mind this but for me it's really annoying that the out takes were taken out of the credits.  I've watched Toy Story 2 many times with my daughter on tape borrowed from her older cousins.  We both liked to watch the credits at the end of the film.  Now, you have to get out the second disc to see the outtakes.  The rest of the film is still funny,  but Barbie just isn't there in the end to say \\"bu-bye, now, bu-bye\\".
B0000A1RJI|4.0|When I first saw the theatrical trailers for this film, I was excited.  Being a huge Disneyland fan, I was naturally enthralled by the idea of a movie based on one of the park's most innovative and successful rides.  The music in the trailer somewhat confused me, though.  The lively \\"Yo-Ho\\" theme used in the ride couldn't be heard--instead, I heard driving orchestral music that sounded different from anything I'd heard before.  But I liked it a lot, and began trying to arrange it for piano. <br /> <br />Fast forward a few months.  I saw the film and really enjoyed it.  The music caught my attention again--it was very, very similar to what I'd heard in the trailer, but it wasn't exactly the same.  Nevertheless, I knew I needed the soundtrack. <br /> <br />Now, a few years later, I have most of the 45-minute soundtrack arranged for solo piano and play it regularly.  The soundtrack itself is a well-loved addition to my iPod's hard drive, and I know others who enjoy it as well.  Interestingly, this score works so well because it is NOT stereotypical \\"pirate music.\\"  The film is by no means a conventional pirate film, and Klaus Badelt's take on the music is intriguingly modern.  It mixes orchestral and electronic elements into a sonic texture that Hans Zimmer's Media Ventures has made so ubiquitous in films of this nature. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a fresh and unique approach to film scoring, POTC is not for you.  This is the same sort of music that Zimmer and Badelt and the other composers at Media Ventures have written for films like The Time Machine and Gladiator.  That being said, this is of somewhat higher caliber than other Media Ventures scores I've heard. <br /> <br />Several very similar themes are utilized throughout the score.  Sometimes they become rather monotonous, but there are some renditions that are shockingly moving.  \\"One Last Shot\\" is the most unique track on the album, featuring an incredibly passionate statement of the main love theme, aswell as a number of French horn \\"echoes\\" of the other themes in the movie. <br /> <br />Let me sum up what I intended to say in this overly long review: <br /> <br />This is neither pure orchestral music nor pure electronic music.  The three or four very similar themes that Badelt composed for the film are used in a number of contexts, sometimes monotonously.  However, every track has its strong points.  Much of the music is loud and uses driving rhythmic figures. <br /> <br />Now we'll have to see how Zimmer does on his score for the film's sequel.  Only time will tell.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Excellent movie.  I can't get enough of it.  The production is great, the music is great and the actors are great.  Have never <br />had a better experience watching a movie.  Gerard Butler's performance moved me like no other actor ever has.  It is great even if you don't care for musicals or opera.
B00005JOFO|1.0|This was billed as The Gay Cowbay Movie, referred to that way endlessly on all month.  Much to my shock and dismay, these were not cowboys at all, but sheep herders.  Leave it to Hollywood to not get the significant difference.  After the first half hour, I fled from the theatre mortified.  If you want to see a real good, funny movie about sheep herders, see if you can find a copy of The Sheepman starring Glenn Ford, Shirley MacLane, and Leslie Nielsen.
0307276902|5.0|I agree with Wanita (above review) on one thing: This book was amazing, riveting, well written, haunting, and life changing.  It is true that this book is changing lives.  But I do not think that Oprah should be frowned upon for calling out James Frey.  He lied.  He lied in his book by representing it as fact, he lied to his publisher, he lied to Oprah, and he lied to the readers.  We celebrated his story and praised him for his journey.  I was very dissappointed to find out that he had lied.  I felt like it was a marketing ploy.  Perhaps James Frey can become a more honest person in the wake of this embarrassing situation.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Hey folks its now 1:30 in the morning and I just got back from seeing this band in DC. I used to think seeing a ROTM concert would be the epitamy of amazing. Me being only 20 years old wasn't a concert goer at the time of their seperation sadly. After hearing A7X tonight however, I truly felt a nirvana while getting the crap knocked out of me in the pit and can feel I saw a show on par with anything ROTM could have possibly done.  <br /> <br /> <br />About the album though, the band played about 4 or 5 songs off City of Evil, every one worth buying the CD for in itself. The influences of Iron Maiden, Guns and Roses, Pantera, and other incredible bands are easily heard as their guitar solos beautifully climax and lead singer M Shadows harmonizes with the other equally cliche named members of the band. Almost all the songs on this CD are long, but none of them ever seems overdone. Everything in them seems to belong without any ridiculous repetition or overused chorus'. These guys are talented to say the least and I believe could help to restart the glory days of the bands they obviously take inspiration from. It is also interesting to hear the creativity of their music, bringing everything from classical acoustic guitar to a fully symphony at times to truly highly the colossal nature of some of their tracks. <br /> <br />If you have the least bit of interest in Rock or Metal this CD is a must and an instant classic. <br /> <br />And if they ever come to a venue nearby, it could well be the best 25 bucks you will spend.

B000DZIGDU|5.0|I must say this was the first war movie I have ever seen where it genuinely portrayed the reality of joining the military and going to war to the audience while still tastefully throwing in a good bit of laughs along the way without taking anything way from the seriousness of the subject. Most war movies are aimed at just portraying bravery, fighting through the concept of death, and tugging at your heartstrings.  <br /> <br />But \\"Jarhead\\" seemed like it was able to show the good and bad of war, and also not make you feel completely depressed about the whole experience. With \\"war stuff\\" and a little comedy thrown in at appropriate times here and there, it enabled me not only to respect the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform, but also I felt like I could enjoy the storyline itself despite the movie being about the hellish topic of war. <br /> <br />This movie has very little combat in it, so if you were looking for a lot of blood and guts, this might not be for you. If you like a good story about the subject of war and our brave soldiers, then definitely watch it. If I had to compare it to another movie, I would go with \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" because about half of that movie is based in Boot Camp, much like the setting of \\"Jarhead\\".
B000001GAM|5.0|ONE MUST BEAR IN MIND THAT ANTON BRUCKNER WAS AN OLD FASHIONED, DEVOUT ROMAN CATHOLIC, WHO NEVER REALLY SEARCHED FOR GOD, UNLIKE MAHLER, FOR INSTANCE.  ANTON WAS HEAVEN INTOXICATED.  DESPITE THE SOARING DRAMA AND MAJESTY OF HIS SYMPHONIES, BRUCKNER WAS NEVER AWARE OF HIMSELF--HE COULD NO SOONER STRIKE A POSE, THAN RESEMBLE THE BIBLICAL PUBLICAN CONTORTING HIS FACE, FOR ALL TO SEE, WHILE FASTING.  PERHAPS GOD SENT AN ANGEL TO EARTH IN 1824, AND EVEN THOUGH THE CRITIC HANSLICK WOULD NOT HAVE AGREED, THIS WINGED MESSANGER COMPOSED NOT SO MUCH FOR HIS CONTEMPORARIES, BUT FOR THE AGES.  I THINK GIULINI, NOW WITH BRUCKNER AND THE  <br />\\"OTHER\\" ANGELS, UNDERSTOOD.  ONE OF THE FINEST OF ALL RECORDINGS OF ANY BRUCKNER SYMPHONY.  GOD BLESS YOU ANTON AND CARLO.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|OKAY, lemme just say that i am a huge avenged sevenfold fan.  I have been since the early days, not just since city of evil came out.  I sat idly by and watched the reviews pour in for city of evil, some good, some bad.  But when the \\"metal expert\\" a couple of reviews below me dared to call A7X nu metal....i had to step in and say something.  HOW CAN YOU CALL THEM NU METAL?!?!?!?!?!  DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT NU METAL IS?!?!?!  NU METAL is bland riffs that take no major talent!!!!!  Then you say tht the guitars r weak and there could be more solos!!!!  Their are tons of solos!!!! Then you contradict yourself by saying tht the guitars are great!!!  THT DOESN\\"T EVEN MAKE ANY SENSE!!!!!  You must have bad short term memory because apparently you forget what you write a couple of seconds before!  And to complain about the vocals.....i guess i understand tht because most close minded metal heads tht only like screaming and bland clear vocals wouldnt like M. Shadows Axl Rose type of howl.  BUT HEAR THIS:  i love the screaming vocals of all the other current bands.  I love lamb of god, himsa, agony scene, the absence, old inflames, arch enemy, god forbid, kalmah, all those good melodic death or american heavy metal bands, so anybody tht reads this dont say im some hapless mainstream wannabe.  I EVEN LISTEN TO MATH METAL LIKE DILLENGER ESCAPE PLAN!!!!  So yeah, the metal expert is a complete idiot and nobody, and i mean nobody should read his idiotic review.  AND AVENGED SEVENFOLD ARE NOT NUMETAL!!!! and they didnt sell out either, because the definition of selling out is leaving your current style and going with wut is popular and deemed cool.  Last time i checked, writing mostly 7 minute songs and having solos is not really apparent in the current mainstream!!!!!  So anybody tht says they sold out can just shutup!!!!!  GO LISTEN TO YOUR ATREYU AND NEVER SPEAK OR TYPE AGAIN!!!!!!
B00005NTJK|4.0|I bought this after Aqualung on vinyl about a hundred years ago, and much to my surprise liked it even more than Aqualung. There are no filler songs here - every song is very much built on some solid guitar playing with the trademark flute sound of course. This was Tull's 3rd album and marked a move away from the more blues tinged \\"This Was\\" & \\"Stand Up\\" toward a harder rock and in some spots almost psychedelic sound.  Highly recommended to anyone who wants to explore early Tull beyond Aqualung.
0307276902|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time, and Oprah's endorsement had nothing to do with it.  I will NEVER watch her show or support anything that egotistical women does after watching the public humiliation that Frey had to endure on her show. Thanks Frey, for the great book.  I'm looking forward to reading \\"My Friend Leonard\\".

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Bought it after watching Serenity. I am dissappointed that the series is no longer on the TV. I really enjoyed the stories and thought it had alot of potential. I recommend this to all SciFi fans and even Western fans. The Unique mix of Space Opera and Western makes the show completly unique.
B000BCKFWK|3.0|Sin City is definitely a great movie that brings comic book-based movies to another level, but I was rather dissapointed in not being able to view the movie with all extended and delted scenes...It would've made the movie so much better and tied some loose ends together from the original cut.  It was very satisfying to see the extended scenes, but they should've let you choose between viewing the theatrical cut -OR- the extended/unrated version.  The special features were great to experience though, as you got to see more behind-the-scenes featurettes, along with Robert Rodriguez and his crew.  The interactive menu's were cool and creative as well.
B000002JKA|5.0|Heard a LOT of prog heavy or not so and rate this as the greatest heavier prog album of all time, the song structure, production values and playing are as perfect as a set of lugholes could ever wish to hear. <br /> <br />Would give this 6 if I could!!!!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Desperate Housewives is one of my favorite TV shows. It is a nighttime soap opera, but it's also funny, mysterious (all those deep dark secrets). The women are all attractive and the audience can relate to them in many ways. Or maybe we wish we could be like Gabrielle, for instance (with that hunky young gardener, who wouldn't?)or as loveable and vulnerable as Susan. Felicity Huffman portrays a frustrated ex career woman turned mom quite well. Marcia Cross is very much the perfect lady (maybe too perfect) for her own good. Nicolette Sheridan is just so much fun to watch. Her business is real estate, but there's so much more to her, especially when it comes to men.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Since 1998 Britney Spears has ruled the roost of pop music, like her or hate her.  She has remained successful the entire time, putting out hit single after hit single, from her infamous No. 1 smash of a debut \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to 2001's self-skewering club favorite \\"Slave 4 U.\\"  In late 2003, after a year's break, the reigning Princess of Pop put out In The Zone, her fourth studio release, becoming her fourth straight (and record-breaking) No. 1 album.  First single \\"Me Against the Music,\\" featuring mentor Madonna, rushed up the charts, reaching No. 1 in almost every country it charted in, that fall, but it was early 2004 that \\"Toxic,\\" the ubiquitous Bollywood track that reigned as the year's best single, took flight, becoming Britney's first truly \\"comeback\\" single (in terms of success and influence).  Follow-up song \\"Everytime,\\" composed by Spears, followed after, becoming another No. 1 smash for the singer.  Though Zone was panned by critics for being \\"overtly sexual\\" and \\"too raunchy,\\" it remained the best-selling album by any female artist for 2003-2004.  \\"Toxic\\" is, of course, the album's standout track; \\"Everytime\\" is a sweet, often haunting piano ballad that proves Spears is more than just a studio singer.  Should-be single \\"Shadow\\" showcases the singer's often questionable singing talents and \\"Boom, Boom\\" proves the girl's power in any musical genre.  Overall, In The Zone hits more than it misses (\\"Brave New Girl\\" is too electronic and repeatable, \\"Early Mornin'\\" is bland and forgettable) and should be noted for its impressive track list never the less.  Zone is truly a record Spears can be proud of.
B00003CXA2|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was appauled at what all the hype was about.  Fact is, I just saw this movie about a month or two ago when my wife said \\"OH MY GOD, you've never seen Forrest Gump\\" and next thing you know I'm watching it with this expression of \\"OH MY GOD, I can't believe you like this.\\"  I have to say that while Tom Hanks did extraudinary the film still left me somewhat cold and just never really seemed to keep my interest.  After heavy debate I decided to watch the movie again and after my second go through I am slowly starting to see what all the hype was about.  It truly is a beautiful story mostly because you really start to care about this man named Forrest.  The film itself, a plot very poposterous, is moved through by performances by Hanks and Robyn Wright-Penn as well as Gary Senise (hysi)...I think that most people are touched by this film and I was after concidering it deeply.  I guess I just was prepared for somthing different and looking for something different that I couldn't see the greatness that was in front of me.  Thats the problem with hype...you walk into a film expecting so much that you fail to see what everyone saw because your looking in all the wrong places.  I hope this makes sense and I hope this helps anyone whose never seen this film (I highly doubt theres anyone else who hasn't...I think I was the only one)...
B00004SCX6|5.0|Like her or not, Britney Spears has remained at the top of the charts since her award-winning No. 1 smash \\"...Baby One More Time\\" first hit radio in late 1998.  On 2000's record-breaking Oops!...I Did It Again, Britney indeed does do it again, releasing an album of brilliant consistency and pop extraordinaire.  Sure, there are a couple of missteps here (such as the overproduction that is so evidently heard here and the sighing ballads \\"One Kiss From You\\" and \\"Dear Diary\\").  Spears herself does little to prove her vocal abilities on here, save for the vocally-decent \\"Don't Let Be Me The Last To Know,\\" which is sad, but she has always been more about the song than the voice behind it; but this can be blamed on the horrendous overproduced sound to every song.  Overall, Oops!...I Did It Again is a superb record and a great accomplishment compared to the average sophomore slump.
0783222149|4.0|I have to say that Saturday night when my wife and I decided to play couch potato I wasn't expecting to get anything out of the movie she decided to watch.  To be completly honest the only reason I stayed in the room was that I heard John C. Reilly was in this movie.  But I'm glad I stayed, not for Rielly but fort he movie for it in itself was a really decent film.  The story revolves around one family, Gail (Streep) and her husband (I can't spell his last name but it's the guy from Good Night and Good Luck) and their son as they go on a white water rafting trip down river.  Gail is an experianced rafter and because of that she is inadvertantly forced to guide two thieves (Bacon and Reilly) down river.  Kevin Bacon is great at playing bad and Reilly is always wonderfull as the sidekick, whether good or bad.  It's Bacon though that steals the show as the completly evil and unpredictable Wade.  I was impressed at how much I enjoyed the film and there were quite a few thrills and edge of your seat moments.  I'd recomand it for anyone wanting an adrenaline pumper that falls more in line with action drama than scary.  And I was equally impressed that Streep did all her own stunts...now thats dedication.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Already a favourite; love her music.  Even though you can always tell it's her, it's still fresh.  The made-up language may seem gimmicky, but it works here.
B0000024JA|3.0|Listen, Meth is one of my favorite, if not my favorite rapper and so it really pains me to write this review but I have to say it.  The songs are tight but the production is whack and half the songs have beats so loud you can't hear Meth rapping...he almost sounds like a whisper..I wish they would re-release this album with better quality production because the tracks are dope and Meth really knows how to spit it like crazy but he's overshadowed by the lack of quality behind the production.  This lies all in the hands of the track editor how didn't know how to balance things up and clean up the tracks..and some may like the raw feeling to the tracks but I prefer a clean sound...Sorry guys if this review upsets the die hard fans, but that said I am a die hard fan and I have to speak the truth.
B000AYEIL8|5.0|I saw this movie when I was in my early twinty's, the way Lolo grew up, is one of the ways you can grew up where I was born here in Belgium. Thats why I like the movie, a simalar movie in that genre is \\"Wait Until Spring Bandini\\", it's from a Belgian director, but the cast is half American and half Italian. So if you like Lolo you will like that movie to.
0451147367|5.0|Allow me to first state that I am a big Stephen King fan and think that his \\"Bachman\\" works are very good.  It's great to see King write in arenas that he is not known for and to still see his brilliance. <br /> <br />Having gotten my necessary review out of the way, I'll tell you why I am really writing this.  I simply don't think that we should blame the publishers for no longer printing \\"Rage\\".  Stephen King has said before that this was his decision.  While I disagree with it, I think that he has a right to publish or not publish his works as he sees fit.  And you can bet that most publishers wouldn't hesitate to publish an extra book by Stephen King.
6305897786|5.0|I saw this film in the theater three times.  I purchased the DVD as soon as it came out.  This is in my top five all time greatest films.  This was a flawless work of art.  I love books and the opening scene in Telfer's Library instatnly attracted me.  When the camera moved to the bookcase and through the dark space where the \\"Nine Gates and the Kingdom of Shadows once rested, and I heard that great music score, I knew I was in for a treat.  Many people hated the ending of this film; I will say this if you liked Rosemary's Baby, there is a good bet you will love this film.  If you hated Rosemary's Baby, then you probably won't like the Ninth Gate.  Johnny Depp at his best. I just watched this film two days ago as a matter of fact for the umpteenth time.  One of my all time favorites.  Highly Recommended. <br />
B0000UJL96|4.0|While i was intrigued by the films theme, it was my love of those Classic characters that drew me to the film.  The supposed last film all the original Trek series characters would be in together.  Also i was drawn to the dvd extras as well, i always like cast interviews and deleted scenes, this dvd didn't fail to deliver on either. It's not the best Star Trek film, that honor will always go to Wrath of Khan but as a final send off to great characters it was the best.
B000957O82|1.0|Although I absolutely loved the movie, the quality left me disappointed.  The audio and video was slightly off during the first part of the movie.  It reminded me of the Japanese movies of the 60's where the actor's mouths did not match the audio portion.  I did not return it because it wasn't worth the hassle of returning it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this series -- but after seeing the movie Serenity, I thought I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />I was wowed. It was one of those shows that made me wonder what the network execs were thinking to have it run only one season. Excellent show, excellent characters. A real gem.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I'm usually not one to enjoy movies like this--normally I'd write it off as stupid (which, granted, it is).  But I watched it, and I have to say, I loved it.  You have to realize that it's this idiotic on purpose.  The men are supposed to be that misogynistic.  The humor is supposed to be that obscure (and, come to think of it, obscene too).  And hilarity ensues.  I've watched it a few times, and I still laugh.  You have to admit, the \\"glass case of emotion,\\" \\"I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!\\" and \\"Afternoon Delight\\" are priceless.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Great movie. I love Frank millers's books and this movie translates well to the screen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|An excellent presentation of the Firefly Television series. Extra features were informative and entertaining. I really enjoyed the \\"never before aired\\" selection. I'll watch this box set often.
0307276902|5.0|Wow!  Couldn't put it down.  Very open and raw.  (watch out for bad words!)
B00003CXDD|5.0|I do not know why this movie does not get more acclaim. It has a great story line, fine acting, good dialogue, etc. My kids watched the VCR version of the movie that they actually wore it out and we bought the DVD. I am sorry Ron Howard did not come out with a sequel.
0143036556|5.0|That's what \\"Collapse\\" really is.<br /><br />And apparently, a lot of people reading this review don't like hearing the idea that \\"collapse\\" could include the good old U.S. of A., judging by ratings of my review.<br /><br />In Guns, Germs and Steel, Diamond explains why, in essence, the North is North and the South is South (to sinplify the divide between the developed and the less-developed world). It is due to inferiority in one or more of these three elements.<br /><br />Here, he takes his interdisciplinary examination of social humanity a step further, looking at why some notable societies of the past have, after greater or lesser \\"success,\\" however that might be measured, eventually collapsed. In short, Diamond says in Collaps that past performance with guns, germs or steel is no guarantee of future results.<br /><br />Diamond looks at how some societal collapses of the past may be multi-causal, as well, and not just traced to single problems. This includes looking at how different causes can interact with one another, including feedback mechanisms.<br /><br />From there, Diamond then becomes a prophet of sorts, examining how a similar collapse might happen to our society today. With Peak Oil finally starting to get a bit of mainstream media play, and knowing speciality reporters and bloggers starting to discuss Peak Heavy Metals, knowing readers can understand whence Diamond writes -- not to mention global warming, of course.<br /><br />Diamond gives a serious look at societies past; whether or not every prediction he makes would come true in America, he certainly is no \\"false prophet of political correctness.\\"
038542471X|2.0|I remember reading \\"The Chamber\\" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out.
6305897786|5.0|I've seen this intriguing indefinable film (that crosses genres like mad) several times now and with each viewing it becomes more engaging. The absurdly bad reviews are from individuals who clearly love unsubtle horror films and it's sad that their inappropriate reviews have dragged this down to (at last look) a three-star film. Those who love The Da Vinci Code would probably enjoy this--thinking person's supernatural/thriller/horror.
0060899190|5.0|This is a remarkable documentation of an extraordinary project.  Frank Warren's idea: to allow ordinary people to reveal a previously undisclosed secret annonymously on a postcard, results in some of the most authentic statement of soul ever witnessed.  Each card becomes a window to the personality beyond.  The revelations are both great and small.  Some talk of buried wounds like rapes or suicide attempts.  Others point to internal judgements and dissatisfactions.  Still others are fleeting: thoughts about coffee and other momentary joys.  All have the authenticity that we yearn for when we look at any work of art.  Because of the annonymity and the matter-of-factness of the medium, there is none of the usual pressuse to produce something 'great', and so what appears is something 'true'.  This book should be required reading for anyone who seeks to make work that touches others.  It will change your life, if you let it.
B00005OM5L|5.0|The video is fantastic,the audio is exceptional,the performance is as good as it gets.Turn your surround way up and play \\"Badge\\"(over and over again).This DVD will have you hooked from start to finish and you'll find yourself going back to the same tracks:Badge,Five Long Years,Tearin'Us Apart,White Room etc.Worth ten times more than the price you'll pay!I have approx. 50-60 concert DVD's and this is still the best of them all. p.s. Clapton's soloing is the best that you will ever see!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie.<br /><br />I was a big fan of the TV show that it is based on, but in a way I'm jealous of anyone who is going to see the movie that wasn't already familiar with the Firefly universe because as a fan, there were certain things I was looking for and sometimes that can be distracting. The movie is very accessible to anyone who hasn't seen the TV show so if you are concerned that you might get lost because you hadn't seen the show, don't be. See this movie. Trust me.<br /><br />It had fantastic dialogue, great visuals, and gorgeous music.<br /><br />It was beautiful when it needed to be, ugly when necessary, funny, sad, and exciting. It was everything a movie like this should be! And most important (at least for me), it was surprising. Too many movies are so obvious you already know how it will end before it is half over. But not this one.<br /><br />There is a scene where Sheppard Book says to Mal, \\"They'll come at you sideways.\\" Well, Joss does too. He does the unexpected and it just rocks. This isn't a warm and fuzzy action adventure. People are at risk; nothing is sacred, nothing safe. I love that.<br /><br />I even thought to myself more than once, `why couldn't George Lucas do it like this?' I saw Star Wars Episode III and was (sadly) bored to tears by the opening sequence. Never once was I bored with Serenity. I was clutching my seat, gasping in shock along with everyone else in the theater. And when it was over, they audience applauded, in a movie theater. What does that tell you?<br /><br />Also, even as a woman I can say this without jealousy, but Gina Torres is gorgeous in this film. She needs to be in more movies.
0156027321|1.0|The story is 100% fiction, despite the introduction's assertion of the opposite.  I had to skim about 100 pages before the plot thickened, so to speak, and then discovered in research after finishing that the whole story line is fiction.  If I had known that from the beginning, the plot would always have remained thin.   <br /> <br />For people who are short on time and truly need their book reading time to mean something, choose another book.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm addicted to Evenescence!!! <br /> <br />GOING UNDER: 5 <br />A great opening to a great CD!!! You can really hear the anger and emotion, as in all the songs. I love it! <br /> <br />BRING ME TO LIFE: 4 1/2 <br />It would have been a 5 if I hadn't heard it a million times. One of my favorite songs though!!! <br /> <br />EVERYBODY'S FOOL: 5 <br />I love this song! I can relate to it,and Amy Lee is amazing! <br /> <br />MY IMMORTAL: 5 <br />Very pretty, very sad, very touching, need I say more? <br /> <br />HAUNTED: 5 <br />You can see why it's called Haunted. Very unique, very amazing... :-) <br /> <br />Tourniquet: 5 <br />I like how it's based on christiannity and the song is amazing. <br /> <br />IMAGINARY: 5 <br />I need to say, the lyrics are absolutely amazing. I cry when I hear this song sometimes!!! <br /> <br />TAKING OVER ME: 5 <br />Not my favorite, yet I still love it!!! <br /> <br />HELLO: 4 1/2 <br />I love this one too, but doesn't quite deserve a 5. Very sad. <br /> <br />MY LAST BREATH: 1,000,000,000 <br />Okay, maybe it's just me, but this is not only my fave song on the CD, but my fave song IN THE WORLD!!! I like tyhe guitar part especially. Ben Moody is amazing here <br /> <br />WHISPER: 5 <br />I like this song a lot, like the others. <br /> <br />BONUS TRACK:5 <br />On my CD, I got a \\"BONUS TRACK\\". It's \\"MY IMMORTAL\\" with the big gutair part in it. I personally like the touch ofrock in that song. <br /> <br />Alltogether, this CD gets a 76,000 out of 5. lol :-) No, but this music is great, and I really reccomend it to anyone who likes rock.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|There is no character development; no stroy plot; no consistency of genre; no suspense or respect for the audience's intelligence. <br /> <br />Instead the director relies on lots of adolescent, mechanistic cheap sex featuring a pair of cheap, trashy looking girls that look like the are moonlighting in acting in the movie and actually portraying their primary job in the process--and then tons of blood with every cliche horror trick from hiding among dead bodies to someone's back of their feet cut.  Seen it; it's been done; now let's move on...  Next... <br /> <br />Some stupid, prissy American guy is whining about how \\"it has to be a real rush,\\" refering to his want to really do all the nasty little things he wants to do to a poor Asian woman whom we know nothing about in the movie and whom he cuts her eye out of her face.  Why?  Just for kicks. <br /> <br />After about 30 minutes or so of this and some new guys coming in with masks (remember Dr. Giggles or Jason ?!  Hello !!!).  Seen it; been done; let's move on...  Next... <br /> <br />Then the final scene...  I had to make sure I was still in the right theater, as I almost fell asleep at one point and thought they were featuring a coming attaction of some new super hero movie.  Basically the most unlikable guy in the movie escapes, kills his tormentor and then goes on a merciless rampage and offs all the people that were part of this ring.  It's just a total rip off of High Tension and the Devil's Rejects in theme, which surely influenced Eli Roth.  Both those movies had plot and character developement.   <br /> <br />Honestly, this \\"film\\" looked like some wannabe film director's final project in a film course.  Just awlful for the big screen!!! <br /> <br />Not even worthy of the status of being a \\"B-movie.\\" <br /> <br />I wanted to go on a rampage myself, it was so bad! <br /> <br />And if you think the stupid sluts are worth it, think again.  They really really really need acting lessons.  People are saying they look hot and sexy.  They look like total diseased Euro-sleaze-street-trash.  Who'd every thought a movie's sex scene would have been boring, but I swear it was so lamely filmed it was just bad!  Bad!  Bad! Bad! <br /> <br />Eli Roth, you TOTALLY SUCK BIG DONKEY SCHLONG!!!!   <br /> <br />YOU WILL NEVER EVER EVER BE A QUENTIN TARANTINO...  YOU WILL NEVER EVER BE EVEN A TENTH OF A QUENTIN TARANTINO.  JUST GIVE IT UP AND STOP EMBARRASSING YOURSELF YOU DUMB SCHMUCK.  YOU JUST PLAIN SIMPLY SUCK AT WRITING AND PRODUCING.  DO SOMETHING ELSE ALREADY!!! <br /> <br />
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I've been a Rent fan for a while now. The moment I heard they were making Rent a movie, I was estatic because I've never had the chance (or money) to go see it on broadway. <br /> <br />When I first bought the movie soundtrack, I was a little scared. Even though most of the lyrics were the same, there were more drums, more guitars and the music seemed so powerful I was afraid it would take away from the plot and theme of the movie. I refused to listen to the movie soundtrack for a while. <br /> <br />But when I saw the movie, the soundtrack made sense. The more modern music fit in perfectly with the vivid colors and strong emotions that could be seen in the movie. <br /> <br />The original broadway *is* better than the movie (the original almost always is better than the new version). But Rent made an amazing transition from the stage to the big screen.
B000002LCX|4.0|If it makes any difference, in the latest issue of Uncut, take 104, Marr states that the band always thought 'Strangeways' as their strongest record. <br /> <br />I personally think 'Meat is Murder' was best, but I remember listening to Strangeways very heavily in 1987, and having a complete feeling of sadness, because you knew it was over.  Not because it was poor in any way, but because the mood of the record was so alone.
B0007M22TI|4.0|Very glitzy, excellent visuals and sound. Well worth the money and time.
1591396190|4.0|I'll have to agree with some of the negative reviews....the authors put too much emphasis on pretty charts and the same few examples...almost trivializing the concept of \\"strategy\\" in the process. <br /> <br />However, what this book does provide is yet another way to look at the challenges facing industry and a possible way of framing responses to those challenges.  Many times, the key to coming up with the right solution is to simply phrase the question differently.   Blue Ocean Strategy looks at re-phrasing the typical competitive strategy (how to lower cost, pump out more landfill, etc).  It is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it, just don't fall into the typical management trap of \\"this is the hottest trend and the only book you need to read\\".
B000B8QG0O|4.0|I bought this DVD for my son (4 years old)because he loved Toy Story so much. My daughter (21 months) also liked Toy Story.  At the beginning of the movie, my daughter was scared and started crying...then you figure out it's a game.  Later, my son got upset because they took Woody and he was being \\"sent away\\". Then he cried because Slinky Dog got separated from the other group of toys.  It is because of this that I give it 4 stars.  My husband and I thought this was a great movie.  Just reserve it for older kids viewing.
0060507772|4.0|I enjoyed reading The Last Hero as much as any of the other Discworld books. Which is to say, \\"A lot!\\" The characters are as vivacious as ever and the plot is just as twisted (pun intended) as any I've seen in this series. The only negative aspect of this book is the artwork. Not that the pictures aren't very well done: they are very entertaining. I guess I've just become set in my ways and prefer my imagination to make the imagery. I felt like the characters lost a bit of their appeal to me when I saw them as portrayed by another person, even if Paul Kidby is a talented artist. I would recommend that anyone who has enjoyed Discworld books before should read this one without paying too much attention to the artwork. After you finish the story, go back and enjoy all the fascinating pictures. It'll be like getting a second book free.
0399208534|5.0|A book for every child (including baby boomer kids). Great illustrations and story. My one year old granddaughter loves it.
B00005LC1H|5.0|The Fawlty Towers Collection proves that comedy does not have to be vulgar or suggestive.  It is good clean fun that really makes people laugh out loud.  I would recommend it to anyone.
0805017445|5.0|An excellent book for kids of all ages. I am a teddy bear collector and use this book when I do presentations to pre-schoolers. Great illustrations. Lakeshore has felt animals that match the story. They stick on a felt board or felt apron so children can actively participate.
B0009I7O7U|4.0|This album is almost there - with some ingenuity provided by Kanye and some great vocals from John, it has it's shining moments. The album seems to lose steam in the middle. I would recommend the DVD/CD version for just a few dollars more - it's cool, providing some live concert video footage and interviews. It's worth the purchase just to learn more about this prodigy talent. John Legend has the chops and the skills, I think that a little more refining and working with some producers that can help him fine-tune some lyrics and instrumentation could make his next album a 5 star. Glad he's around and looking forward to his next record, just wish he'd ask his \\"musical guests\\" to keep the lyrics clean.
B00005RRYS|5.0|I first bought the regular album \\"No Angel\\" because of Dido's great pop-singles from \\"Life For Rent\\". It took me quite some time to realize that this album, her debut, was actually just as great - well greater!!<br /><br />Fewer songs on this album have the immediate hit qualities that seem to be all over its successor, but every song seem to grow on you; and I have no doubts that this will become a classic. One of the very few albums with no unimportant tracks.  There is something heavenly about Dido's breathy voice. I sometimes think of her a British counterpart of Suzanne Vega, though she actually does not sound like her, or like anyone else that I know of, for that matter.<br /><br />Her music combines the best elements of pop, folk, rock, techno and even hip-hop.<br /><br />My favourites used to be \\"Here With Me\\", \\"Don't Think of Me\\", \\"Thank You\\" and \\"No Angel\\"; now they're all favourites.<br /><br />Obviously I had to look out for this enchanced version of the album.<br /><br />I have to admit that I don't care very much for the extended versions of \\"Hunter\\", \\"Take My Hand\\" and \\"Thank You\\", but the Lukas Burton Mix of \\"Here With Me\\" is great and the new track \\"Christmas Day\\" is heartbreakingly outstanding. Like a Sandy Denny type folksong, only written in the 21st century. This track alone justifies the extra expenses for this CD<br /><br />\\"Thank You\\" Dido!
B00008977N|5.0|The sound and quality on this DVD was excellent!   You could clearly hear Peter Gabriel, and he sounded great (which compared to the \\"Growing Up\\" concert DVD, he always sounded far away and faded out).   All the band members, including Gabriel were very energitic and vibrant!  This was a concert that I wished I would have seen with my own eyes.   All the song selections that Gabriel made for this concert were either his better and livelier songs, such as Sledgehammer, Sulsbury Hill, and Shaking the Tree, or they were at least pleasant and melodic, and enjoyable to listen to.  From beginning to end, this was a very entertaining DVD.  I played this for several friends who were not into Gabriel, and one even said that he would love to purchase the dvd.  It is a dvd that will make an impression on you!  I am not a true Gabriel fan, yet I enjoyed the dvd and concert very much.  I would recomend it to anyone in a heartbeat!
B00005JMFQ|2.0|My daughter and daughter in law liked it. My wife watched it I lasted 10 minutes and went to the internet.
B00005JOFO|2.0|I guess I might be one of the minority who wasn't impressed... Kudos to both actors who did an excellent job physically playing these parts, but I thought the storyline was shallow, like an easy read book, and was left hanging at the end of the movie with Ennis' promise to Jack to... well, to do something, I guess.  I hope viewers don't try too hard to be impressed with this breakthrough movie just because of the unconventional storyline, because I think that's about all it has going for it.  The most sorrow for lost love I felt in this movie was when the wife of Ennis had to live with her unbearable knowledge for all those years because that's what women did back then, and the disregard he showed for his daughters amidst his own love for Jack.  That was the saddest part of the movie as far as I'm concerned. I can't be the only one who saw it this way, can I???
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" has finally reached the hills of Tennessee. I wish it were earth-shattering news, but apparently word has already gotten out. Curtis and I went to Nashville with a friend of ours to screen the famous same-sex love story between two ranch hands. I expected a similar crowd to that of \\"Latter Days,\\" which played at the same theatre a couple of year ago. <br /> <br />It wasn't. \\"Latter Days,\\" the Mormon-missionary-loves-the-player love story by director C. Jay Cox drew meager audiences across the country, and drew only a few dozen people the night we saw it. \\"Brokeback,\\" on the other hand, was a sold-out crowd in the theatre's largest auditorium, one of three screens that showed that film.  <br /> <br />And almost half of that audience was straight, unless those heterosexual couples were comprised of gay men with their fag hags. There wasn't a dry eye in the audience by the time the closing credits rolled.   <br /> <br />For those few of you that live under a rock, \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" from \\"Crouching Tiger\\" director Ang Lee, is the story of two ranch hands who work the slopes of the titular mountain while herding sheep in 1963. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) are simple, relatively uneducated men who must cope with emerging feelings for each other. Their friendship leads to a cold night in a pup tent, which sparks a passionate romp during which the two men have sex. <br /> <br />And no one walked out of the theatre. No one yelled, \\"UGH!\\" It struck at the very core of those of us who have had similar awkward positions of first love, whether same-sex or not. As uncomfortable as it might have been for the straight men in the audience, they got it too. These two men didn't know how to really express their love for each other. They couldn't kiss (I'll pay well to keep Curtis from telling the story of our first kiss in any detail). <br /> <br />But then the movie progresses to detail the fact that it wasn't a \\"one-shot deal,\\" as Ennis wanted at first. The rest of the summer brought them closer and closer together. Their final parting was bitter, hard, and still awkward.  Of the two actors, Ledger rises far above the brilliant Gyllenhal, especially during a scene immediately after their scuffle in which Ennis must cope with the fact that he's truly in love, even if it's a forbidden love. <br /> <br />The rest of the film is a montage of the lives of the two men over the next twenty years, and we're introduced to both of the characters' wives. The complexity of the script is illustrated when Alma, Ennis' wife stumbles on her husband kissing this strange man from Texas who's coming for a fishing visit. <br /> <br />Now we know what fishing buddies really are, it seems. Strange how they never fish.  <br /> <br />\\"Brokeback\\" is clearly Ledger's shining moment, and Gyllenal's performance has its own passion. The chemistry between the two men is real, and the beauty of the cinematography is stunning.  <br /> <br />\\"I wish I could quit you,\\" Jack tells Ennis later in the story. The power of love that's displayed in \\"Brokeback\\" is beyond borders, greater than fear, and brilliant even until that final frame. <br /> <br />Is it the \\"gay cowboy movie,\\" as some say? Not really. But it is a powerful love story as only Ang Lee could tell. In the end, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will bury itself into your heart as the force of nature it is. Don't miss it. We drove an hour to see it. I left the theatre in stunned silence as I realized that I was still spellbound by the time I got home. <br /> <br />In the end, it's worth the time, the drive, and your ten bucks. Just bring a few Kleenexes.  <br /> <br />- David W. Shelton <br />
0195067142|5.0|As an old Marine, I have been turned off by many books claiming to be \\"authentic\\" accounts of combat in various wars.  \\"With the Old Breed\\" is probably the best I have ever read.  It paints a vivid picture of a hard fought war through the Pacific Islands, as seen through the eyes of a Marine Private (and later Corporal).  Some scenes are very graphic, others are left ot the viewer's imagination.  What the reader comes out with is a deep appreciation of the young men who endured this form of terrible combat, often with very high losses in both killed and wounded.  It is another reason to thank those who served so valiantly to preserve our freedom.<br /><br />  While none of the battles in the book took place on Iwo Jima, the campaigns of Peleliu and Okinawa are yet other examples of the unique quality attributed to WWII Marines -- \\"uncommon valor was a common virtue.\\"
0380778556|1.0|This book is, without question, the most boring peace of literature ever written. It makes the technical manual to my VCR look like \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". In fact, it's so boring that I recommend a new synonym for boring, \\"Rebecca\\". The book is about people who have disgustingly unbelievable personalities, who do really boring things, and make up mysteries about killing people that aren't even in the story, then insist on telling you about it. The main character/narrator is the most overly emotional and sappy person in all of fiction, and could never ever be a real person, even in the 1920s when this book takes place. She insists on telling you about all of her problems, and how she can never \\"feel right\\" at Manderly, even though no sane person could EVER care. It's enough to make you sick. The story really wasn't that bad but it could have easily been told in about 1/10 of the amount of time. It's like Dickens description without everything that makes Dickens good. Even after the thousands of atrocities committed by Hitler, I still consider him to be a great man, for burning THIS book. It's that bad.
B000002U82|4.0|I first thought that this album was alright. To be honest, Animals is by far my favorite and it always will be.  <br />The thing about this album that I like is the overall sound is huge! The \\"hugest\\" moment is in the chorus of my favorite track \\"Brain Damage\\", which I believe a lot of the kids who reviewed this album have. The backing vocals, the guitar effects, everything made that moment in the song just explode.  <br />The album also seems to be somewhat thematic. A lot of things reoccur. The album starts with an amalgamation of all the sound effects sampled throughout the CD. The crazy laughing sample is heard something like 3 times. The song \\"Time\\" goes back into \\"Breathe\\" in the end. <br />I say that Pink Floyd is by far one of the most sophistocated bands of their time. Of all the british bands of the 60's and 70's, Pink Floyd couldn't be classified with any said \\"genre\\". They appeared to be halfway between rock and psychadelia, with a signature sound that made you know who it was immediately as the song started. Great album, F-ing amazing band.
0307276902|5.0|I would have reacted to this book in the same way had I found it in the Fiction aisle. This book is written with a relentless eye for detail. You will find no self indulgence nor an unnecessary word in the entire text. <br /> <br />This is a stellar book, and I churned my way through it quickly, almost greedily. Books are stories. Tales which put us into a world other than our own. This book did its job. I do not care a whit whether it is a memoir or a novel. I entered this dimension created entirely by the author, and I lived through a rollercoaster of experience with the characters. <br /> <br />What more can one ask of a book? <br /> <br />I saw clips of the Oprah show. And it was a \\"show\\" indeed. What I saw was a very intelligent businesswoman making a strategic decision to protect her \\"credibility,\\" her stock in trade. I found her less credible than the author.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|<br /> For anyone looking for a comedy that you can watch with your family, with no foul talk or offending humour, this is a good one to see. Napoleon is the classic \\" super nerd\\" and couldn't be played any better. There is not much of a plot, but there really doesn't need to be. The movie's look and feel, and the lines that are delivered are sufficient to entertain. It's the ultimate nerd movie, complete with a pleasant ending.

0307276902|1.0|That should be the title to the book. For those of you saying Frey is such a great writer, you are fooled, The only great writer is the late Eddie Little, which Frey took his writing style and copied his works. I spent a lunch hour comparing the start of Little's book with A Million Little Pieces. \\"After reading an excerpt of Another Day in Paradise,\\"  \\"it's not hard to see the similarities.\\" Namely: <br /> <br />The excerpt includes at least one instance of repetitive style, a prostitute girlfriend who was routinely sexually abused by her father, and a protagonist afflicted with \\"the rage\\" (I believe Frey called his \\"the fury\\")... not to mention the protagonist kid being a heavy duty drug user and criminal, who has enough drugs to kill himself with, etc., etc. (all in the first five pages)....  <br /> <br />[And] Little's character's prostitute girlfriend is also named after a flower `Rosie' (as opposed to `Lily'?). Come ON. <br /> <br />Here's another excerpt from Another Day in Paradise.  <br /> <br />Honestly, I don't remember Frey's memoir well enough to form an opinion. It made as much of an impression on me, in the end, as a Jerry Springer episode. <br />  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I became a fan of Jewel Staite (Kaylie) because of the series on TV. It's nice to watch without the annoying, intrusive commercials. Definitely worth buying.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I resisted watching this film. At first I assumed it was a gimmick: a mainstream movie featuring \\"breakthrough\\" love scenes between gay men. Then I thought it would be too serious and depressing, with pain and misery on all sides. I was wrong on both counts, and Brokeback turns out to be the best movie of the year.<br /><br />But I wasn't completely wrong. It is a breakthrough film, and there is pain and misery, but the quality of the story, the script, and the acting rise above everything else and come across as true, compelling, and universal. Brokeback is not about gay love; it's not about forbidden love; it's not about star-crossed love. It's about accepting people for who they are and the joy of a true bond of love.<br /><br />I thought the love scenes might be a little off-putting, but they were genuinely touching. For Ennis and Jack, it wasn't just about sex; more important was the emotional freedom and trust they allowed each other, so they could open up to happiness rather than suffer in loneliness. Affection was easier for Jack, and it was especially heart-warming to see Ennis emerge from his shell.<br /><br />Brokeback is a bittersweet tale of the redeeming power of love, as well as the sometimes desperate struggle for love and against loneliness.
0307276902|4.0|A lot of new books are starting to blur together.  They may have different characters in different places, but to me they all seem the same.  Frey's Million Little Pieces stood out in that it went outside the box with regards to content and writing style. <br /> <br />Million Little Pieces is Frey's memoir from his time in rehab recovering from numerous addictions.  He struggles with beating his addictions, but to get to that point he must hold on and get to the point where he can trust himself and start to trust others.  The other people he meets in rehab are, in my opinion, more interesting than Frey himself.  I agree with other reviewers that I don't really feel that compassionate for Frey because he seems like a spoiled brat, he made the choices himself, and he doesn't seek help in the treatment center.  I think Frey would agree with this assessment since most of the time he recognizes the three points I just laid out. <br /> <br />The memoir is written in stream-of-consciousness fashion with loose punctuation, to say the least.  Screams and shouts are acknowledged with bold letterface or capital letters.  This is interesting because it feels as if Frey is writing in a journal, and you can feel his anger by seeing how hard he was pressing on the page when he spoke of an upsetting event.  At times it was a little hard to understand who was saying what, but it becomes easier to understand as one reads on. <br /> <br />The book is extremely powerful at times, speaking in simple terms about addiction, the causes, and how it continues to affect people after they cease use of their drug of choice.  At times it can get a bit sentimental, but it can't be all raw pain and emotion.  I think it's great that it can help people get through their own issues with addiction and help friends and family of addicted people understand a bit about what their loved one is going through. <br /> <br />A note about the whole hullabaloo over parts of it being made up and embellished.  1)I can't believe that the publisher or Oprah didn't check out Frey's story before they put so much money and their reputation on line for it.  It seems that a simple background check would have been sufficient, but they believed Frey on his word, which seems a bit bizarre to me...  2) Memoirs are almost always riddled with exagerations and white lies about the actual events.  In the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, \\"memoir\\" is defined as \\"a narrative composed from personal experience; an autobiography\\".  And an autobiography is defined as \\"a biography of a person narrated by himself.\\"  Nowhere does it say that the information must always be true.  It's sad that Frey may have presented it as being completely true, and that he seems to enamored of the truth in the book, but one must take the word \\"memoir\\" with a grain of salt.  3) Finally, if this book can and has helped people in the struggles with their addiction or understand an addicted loved one, why does it matter if it's true or false?  I understand that people may feel duped, but that doesn't change the relationship that people had with the book the first time they read it. <br /> <br />I think this book was a breath of fresh air from the cookie cutter books that have been coming out recently, and I think it deserves the praise it has received.
B000A2H2TK|5.0|1977's \\"The Missing Piece\\" is a controversial Gentle Giant album, as it witnessed this progressive rock band simplify their intricate music into more straightforward, accessible-sounding rock. The band have said that the late-70's punk movement played a major role in this, as it rendered the band's complex art-rock of the past unfashionable, and they thought it best to change musical direction a bit and deliver some music that was more easily digestible to the masses. Hence, the radio-friendly material of \\"The Missing Piece.\\" Upon hearing it for the first time, some GG fans went into shock, accusing the band of selling out. But take it from me, the criticisms of the album are absolute rubbish. I love \\"The Missing Piece,\\" and I'd easily place it somewhere in the band's Top Five best works. What it all boils down to is the quality of the songs & performances, and Gentle Giant sound *terrific* on this disc. I thoroughly enjoy the band's music of the past (my personal faves include \\"Three Friends\\" and \\"The Power And The Glory\\"), but I like the fact that the band loosened up on \\"The Missing Piece.\\" There's definitely a renewed vigor & energy radiating from the band on this release, and for once, they're not taking themselves too seriously. They sound like they're having a really good time on \\"The Missing Piece,\\" and what's wrong with that? And the absolute bottom line is, every single song on this album is great. The bouncy \\"Two Weeks In Spain\\" is a great tune. \\"I'm Turning Around\\" is a very strong power number. \\"Betcha Thought We Couldn't Do It,\\" \\"Who Do You Think You Are?,\\" and \\"Mountain Time\\" are all freewheeling, fun rockers. \\"As Old As You're Young\\" succeeds in capturing the \\"Ol' English\\" feel of earlier Gentle Giant, yet still manages to be a catchy song. \\"Memories Of Old Days\\" is an absolutely beautiful number, the album's secret weapon, and one of Gentle Giant's very best songs. And the concluding pair of \\"Winning\\" and \\"For Nobody\\" are both very strong. \\"The Missing Piece\\" is the Gentle Giant album that anyone can like, even that girlfriend or grandmother of yours who you never thought could ever warm up to the band's complex albums of the past. But you can definitely play this one for them. As far as I'm concerned, \\"The Missing Piece\\" IS a Gentle Giant classic.

0670032506|2.0|I can not recommend David Allen's earlier book, Getting Things Done, highly enough. I read it six months ago and continue to follow his system, using the Outlook plug-in sold on his web site. I had made a reminder when I finished that book to re-read it in six months. When the time came, I decided to pick up this book instead. It was a mistake.<br /><br />Ready For Anything is a series of short inspirational essays on productivity. It has a strong self-help feel to it. If you've read GTD and aren't convinced that the system is worth implementing, maybe this book will sell it to you. For those who are already practicing the system, it doesn't offer a whole lot. Many essays are about the importance of having a system, or the importance of the weekly review, a key element of the system. Others are simply meanderings with no concrete purpose. There are quotes peppered in the margins throughout. While some are thought-provoking, they distracted me from the main text. I'd prefer to see them at the beginning or end of the essay.<br /><br />If you haven't read Getting Things Done, absolutely read that first. If you need a little motivation to keep you on track, maybe Ready For Anything will help.

0440418569|1.0|This novel was such a tremendous let down that it's hard to know where to start listing its failings. If ever there was an example of an author biting off more than he could chew, this series is it. The first book was fantastic and original; the second still original but more juvenile; The Amber Spyglass is a mess in which dismally few of the intriguing threads and questions of the first two books are wrapped up. I still have no clear idea what Dust is, as there are so many competing explanations that it is impossible in the end to know anything. In one place Dust is \\"angels\\", in another it seems to be some kind of great Cosmic Consciousness, but its relation to us is muddled and confused. If it clings to animate creatures, why is it lacking in the bears? We don't have it as kids, it is attracted to us as adults, and after we are REALLY dead (even if we are still kids) our ghosts dissolve back into it...I think. Whereas it is originally believed by the Magisterium in Lyra's world to be `original sin', Pullman never gives a reason for their belief. And Dr, Malone finds it is flowing out of the various worlds through the holes cut with the Subtle Knife. But where is it going? It's draining all life away? Then why don't kids have it in the first place? And again,  what about the armored bears?  <br /> <br />Throughout this book, Pullman dumps information in conversation that he never develops dramatically. This is most apparent in his view of God as a kind of super-Saddam Hussein, who has lied not only about his own powers and origins but in the promises he makes to unsuspecting believers. We never see this played out, mind you; God makes his only appearance as a deposed, demented old man later in the book. We don't discover, along with Lyra and Will, the man behind the curtain. We get no evidence of the truth of the story we are told, at least in respect to this trilogy. We are just supposed to accept what we are told, that this is the REAL story, no matter what we might have experienced to the contrary. I am not speaking for or against religion here; I am talking about weak writing. This is at the very least dramatically unsatisfying. And it's not much of an argument for his point of view, either. <br /> <br />Let there be no mistake, the evils of this world are embodied, for Pullman, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition. All the evils of these worlds are dressed in the trappings of Christianity, most specifically the Catholic Church. There are no evil Muslim priests; there are no crazed Sikhs. But again, though he wants to lay the blame for all man's ills on God and the Christian religion, he doesn't offer a great deal of evidence. Yes, the Magisterium is behind the dreadful experiments to separate children from their demons (though I still don't know what this has to do with Dust.). And everyone associated with the Church is evil almost to the point of cartoonishness. No Mother Teresa's here! But other than that, the Church seems to have little impact on the world(s) at large. In Lyra's world, the armored bears lead a godless existence, the Witches worship their own pagan deities, all without any interference from the Magisterium. Yes, they are confined to the northern reaches, but where else would you expect to find polar bears? And the Witches seem to thrive there and love their country rather than chafing at some kind of isolation forced by the church. And even in the case of Lyra and those she interacts with, no one prays, no one goes to religious services, there are no religious restrictions. In a society as foully corrupted by the taint of an incredibly powerful church as Lyra's world is SAID to be, I would expect to see more evidence of it in their daily lives. Look at the the fundamentalist Muslim countries, or our own Puritan communities. Religion is and was a part of their every breath. When we come to our world, the author doesn't even mention religion. Perhaps the men after Will's letters are church agents, but if so, I slept through that part. In the worlds of Citagazee and  the Mulefa, God apparently has made no inroads at all! I don't think Pullman can have it both ways. If religion is the root cause of all the evil in the world - and the subject of this entire trilogy is a war against God--  then it had better be pretty omnipresent, as there is a lot of evil out there that needs its support.  <br /> <br />In the worlds where God IS a presence, no glimmer of information is given as to why he lies and tricks people the way he does. Why tell people there is a heaven, and then keep them locked up inside a dreary Eternal Mountain when you could tell them the \\"truth\\" according to Pullman and happily let them be released back into the cosmic stream of Dust? God could at least claim benevolence, evenif he didn't really have anything to do with the way things worked out. Is he a sadist? Perhaps that's Pullman's point, but then we have to take his word that his way is the way things REALLY are, and I don't know who died and made him the spiritual mentor for humanity. It's not enough to say that this is a novel and that the author can make up whatever he wants to. Ideas must be developed, supported, made credible within the world of the story; to expect a reader to suspend his or her disbelief just on the author's say so is almost contemptuous. No one is going to deny that much great harm has been done in the name of religion, be it Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or others. But Hitler wasn't going to war in God's name, and most serial killers are not religious fanatics. There's plenty of evil to go around.  <br /> <br />But there are many other failings. Dr. Malone's whole arc is a tangent that comes to nothing. It is built up that she is supposed to offer some great temptation to Lyra, which, if successful, will give power to the Authority -or not--  but the event never occurs. Malone's sojourn with the Mulefa, while imaginative, seems to be part of another book entirely. And the waythat the author presents her loss of faith as incontrovertible evidence that Christianity was a mistake is one of the weakest point in the book. If he had made her finding faith incontrovertible evidence of Christianity's worth, it would be the be the same issue for me. If I experience such loss or gain through the character, then I can extrapolate that out into a universal message, but this never happens. It's as credible as name calling, and as such, doesn't draw me into the story. <br /> <br />Lord Asriel is an arrogant, self-centered, selfish aristocrat, yet evidently, since he is the one waging war on God, he is forced into the mold of the hero. It doesn't work. Why do all these people and beings follow him? His demise while defeating Metatron (another tangenital charcter that amounts to nothing) is labored and dull. His great fortress, his Intention Machine, his quest for Dust - they're all just obvious plot contrivances that never pay off. <br /> <br />There is a sequence in the recent remake of KING KONG of a brontasaurus stampede that seems endless. Will and Lyra's sojourn in the Land of the Dead is this book's equivalent, overlong and dull, and it raises more questions than it answers. Harpies? So some Greek mythology is real? Living people are trapped in this land? Do they all have Subtle Knives? Though I can see why dissolving into the ether would be joyous compared to the monotonous existence portrayed in this limbo, why did God put them there in the first place? And how did He get the power to do so? Since the only character in the whole trilogy that I really cared about was Iorek, I want to know why the bears, who have a culture, who speak, who are quite clearly different from the regular animals, do not have souls and do not get locked up with the rest of the souls. <br /> <br />The Specters are yet another weak, underdeveloped idea, and the secret of their origin feels as contrived as anything in the whole book.  <br /> <br />The Angels may be the most ineffectual characters I've ever encountered. So why are they going to war if they can't really hurt anything? Why do so many angels remain on God's side? How did Metatron and Baruch make it from man to angel, but no one else did? And since Angels are so ineffectual, how did God, who is just the first angel, get so powerful? Is this some parallel drawn from Paradise Lost? Sorry, but books need to stand on their own, or at least make their pre-requisites known before I lay down my money. <br /> <br />The War is tedious going, mainly because the underlying philosophies of the two hosts are so poorly laid out. For all its buildup, and though it seems interminable, it comes to a rather abrupt conclusion. <br /> <br />The love story between Will and Lyra....enough already!! <br /> <br />I could go on, but I'm thinking I've made most of my points. I don't even disagree with some of the author's lines of thought, but the book commits the ultimate sin of being outlandishly boring. The author sets up a fantastically original world in The Golden Compass and posits some truly intriguing questions along the way. But he is not up to the task of bringing the threads together into a whole piece. He lets his rancor against the Christian religion get in the way of the talented writing ability he demonstrated in the first book, and as a result lapses into tired, unsupported polemic. It's a shame. This had all the potential of being one of the great fantasies of all time.  <br />
B000AY3KN0|4.0|Not having seen King Kong in several years, I was thrilled to get this dvd collector's uncut edition.  The packaging is original, too, coming in a hinged tin box with various pictures from the original posters inside & out.  Having seen the movie several times before, I was most interested in seeing Peter Jackson's 'remake' of the famous \\"Spider Pit Sequence\\", & how he & his team went about it-I was not disappointed; any true Kong fan will love this, as it has been re-created very sympathetically to the rest of the movie, and could have easily been 'spliced' right into the spot where the original was removed so many years ago.  As far as the actual film-I thought it was a bit on the grainy side (thus the 4 stars), although certainly clearer than any version I've seen previously.  The sound, though not 5.1, was devoid of noise & very clean.  All in all, a joy to watch to the end. Highly recommended!
0440419514|2.0|I reviewed all the books individually, going from five sta5rs for book one, then plummeting to one star for book three. I would give the overall series a 2. I have no axe to grind with Mr. Pullman's opinion of religion, but I do resent his letting it get in the way of competently completing his story. (And how anyone can think that religion, particularly roman Catholicism, is not the main focus of the story is beyond me.) The Amber Spyglass is a muddle from start to finish, with so many different ideas tossed together yet never developed that it was an exercise in frustration to force myself through to the ending. He has a great imagination, but he is as zealous and self-righteous in his own opinions as the Chruch that he is railing against. While that may be good fodder for a story, it is not in itself a good story. Hugely disappointing.
1563894696|4.0|I got this after hearing much praise for it, so I decided to pick it up from my favorite comic shop. <br />There are two main things I look for when I think about starting a new comic, is the art good, and is the story well written.  Having never read anything by Loeb before, but loving the way the comic looked I figured there was more of a chance for a hit than miss. <br />And hit it did. Big. <br />Loeb weaves a story that takes back to Batman's roots as a Dectective trying to solve the mystery of a killer who strikes only on holidays.  Though I don't buy this as a direct follow up to Year One, I definetly think this is early in Batman's career, as he does make some mistakes.  This was a nice long comic, but I still finished it in 2 days I was so into the story. <br />Sale's art is nice and dark, and he definetly has created his own style, something that you see and know it is his.  Much in the way Frank Miller has.  It was nice to see unique takes on some of Batman's classic villains.  Basically his art fit the book perfectly. <br />I suggest this comic to any Batman fan, or even a fan of a good crime/detective story.  I look forward to reading the follow up \\"Dark Victory\\"

1401308201|4.0|The grimmerie is the best piece of Wicked merchandise I own.  It is incredibly informative to any Wicked fan, tells you about the actors/actresses, set design, technical design, production, everything.  The real gem though is the photos, they are all LARGE and colorful, a pleasure to look at.  My favorite part is that they didn't limit the book to the OBC, since the majority of people who have seen the show have seen subsequent casts.  Unfortunately the Original Chicago Cast is left out, which is why I only give it four stars instead of five.
0811806405|5.0|For anyone interested in the step-by-step \\"how\\" of building a guitar, this looks like a must read.  As a point of reference, I have a science and engineering background.  My experience to date in this area has been limited to some minor instrument repair and set-up.  I have a fair amount of experience in woodworking.  I found this book to be easy to understand, with pleny of good illustrations and examples. For those who might be wondering, I feel the book does an excellent job of giving full attention to both the steel string and classical designs, while keeping the differences clearly distinct.   <br /> <br />For those interested in the \\"why\\" of design and construction practices the Luthier Handbook is an excellent companion to this book. I bought both at the same time based on a recommendation in a review of one of the books. I found it to be a good recommendation.

B00000JBEI|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is unique. End of story. No other artist alive today can touch him live. He truly is the king of rock. His own songs are so full of hope, life and spirit. He is the closest thing to perfection in terms of being a complete singer/songwriter the world has seen.. He even does Bob Dylan better than Dylan himself(\\"Chimes of freedom\\"). The acoustic version of \\"Born to run\\" is a work of pure genius. A must for Springsteen fans.
B00002E224|4.0|I usually avoid romantic movies.  I detest the predictable beautiful and vapid man and woman, the unrealistic plot.  But I liked this one.  It is a romantic movie for people who hate romantic movies.  The love is real in this one, and suprisingly moving, specifically at the end.<br /><br />Before Sunrise is the story of two young travelers (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) on a train who disembark in Vienna, Austria on a whim.  The two talk about love and life while wandering the city at night.  It is a good thing they were not in New York, or they would have ended up on the missing persons list.  Vienna must be very safe.<br /><br />Before Sunrise is very romantic.  As the night lengthens, the conversations become more interesting.  At least some of their ideas will resonate with you.  Some are so deep, they made me want to cry.  The film is very well done.  You feel as if you are just a fly on the wall observing this young couple.  It is a very quiet, peaceful film, with no action sequences or even fighting.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|I am a passionate fan of this band.  I was expecting to be underwhelmed but they were well rehearsed and tight and, all in all, I think this is one of the best recordings they have ever made.  It is a must see/listen.
0790729369|4.0|Very good woman's movie.  Meryl Streep & Clint Eastwood both did a very good job.  I read the book before watching this movie and felt they could have done a better job on adaptation.  If I had not read the book I don't think I would have really known the exact details of some parts of the movie.  But it did make me watch it 2 times back to back.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|You couldn't have missed the hoopla surrounding this film. Everyone wanted your tots and all your co-workers played the sound boards way too much at work. I did't think the dance scene was all that flippin hot. Although I would have voted for Pedro over Summer anyday. It is true though, there is a Summer Wheatley in every high school.
B000069AUI|5.0|I didn't know much about coldplay or their music until about a year and a half ago, when my friend let me borrowed his CD of Coldplay.  To this day, I still have this \\"borrowed\\" album with me.  When I first listened to this album, the first words that came out of my mouth was \\"amazing.\\"  Everything about this album was perfect, simply perfect.  The music, the sound, the lyrics, everything.  Some of my favorite songs that I listen to over and over again today are \\"In My Place,\\" \\"The Scientist,\\" and \\"Clocks,\\" but you can't go wrong with listening to anything else on the album.  Just listen to the words of the song \\"The scientist,\\" and you'll see why this is a great album.  No one has written lyrics like, and the music they play with the song is also different.  I also haven't heard anyone play music like that as well.  Basically, this song just makes you feel so much emotion that you want to cry.   <br /> <br />Every song on the album is great, unlike many albums that just have a couple songs that you want to listen to.  You could tell by listening that the members of coldplay put their heart and soul all over this album, and they just didn't create it just to make money.  I mean, all the songs you can basically relate with.  Just listen to the song \\"Clocks,\\" that song itself is amazing.  The music and the sound is so different from anything you'll hear, and I mean that in a good way.  What I love best about the album is that Coldplay's songs relate to something in everday life.  This isn't a new album, but I recommend buying this anyways.  It's a can't miss, and it's quite difficult to find an album as good as this these days.
1401307787|5.0|Jon-Kabatt-Zinn is a master of being, in the here and now.  Most of us judge our lives by what we can and will produce and cannot fathom what it is just to \\"Be\\" without all the trappings of expectations, judgment or busy-work.  Kabatt-Zinn shows us how to think of life a bit differently by simply being and discovering who we truly are.  When we can be mindful of ourselves, it brings us to a place of peaceful existence within and without.  An empowering journey for those who continue to struggle with life and the cards we are dealt.
0553801503|2.0|After suffering through multiple delays of publication, and after re-reading the first three books in this series, I was really excited and looking forward to #4.  Well, I got over that quickly.  This book started out with completely new characters; I'm more than halfway through and haven't heard of them again.  It goes in totally new directions and spends little to no time on the characters we know so well from the first books.  The unique cliffhanger storylines are gone and the balanced storytelling went with them. Instead, GRRM is getting lazy and just writing continuous chapters.  Sometimes he bothers to name them after a different character - but not always.   <br /> <br />He has taken one of his least likeable characters, Cersei, and concentrated on her.  One thing I loved about GRRM was the complexity of his characters.  There were things to like and dislike about all of them, they were good and bad; good people made bad choices, no one was perfect.  Tyrion was one of my favorites because he was so complex and tortured.  Well not so Cersei.  She's a mean miserable you-know-what with absolutely no redeeming quality.  It's hard to say if she even really loves her children; the way she treats Tommen borders on abuse.  All I can do is root for her demise.  And where is dead Catelyn?  Where is Tyrion?  Where is Bran, Rickon, Jon, Arya?  There are a few glimpses of some of them, but nothing more than a sentence in the WHOLE BOOK about others.  And what's with sending Brienne all over the Seven Kingdoms on wild goose chases?  If anybody can't see where's she's going to end up, then GRRM isn't foreshadowing very well (which I find hard to believe since he does it every time he writes about her, or her someday-to-be paramour) <br /> <br />It grieves me to say that GRRM appears to have degenerated into the Robert Jordan method of storytelling.  Detail is good.  Paragraphs and paragraphs full of unknown knights, houses, and sigils, is not.  This happens over and over again.  Jordan was the first author I ever skipped paragraphs and even pages.  GRRM now has the distinction of being the second.  And just like Jordan, lo and behold, he gets so bogged down in detail that this story inches along in a mind-numbing slog. <br /> <br />I may have erred in writing this review before finishing the book.  But from the other reviews on here, it doesn't sound like the end is going to be any better than the beginning and the middle.  After years of waiting, I am so disappointed that I don't plan to go any further with this series.  I already learned that lesson with Jordan.

B00097A5HW|5.0|I became a Shakira fan years ago when I saw her in a live performance on a Columbian television broadcast while I was on vacation in Aruba.  I have a variety of her other Spanish language CDs and they are all excellent but I think she has surpassed even her own high standards on this round.  The various nuances of her strong, distinctive voice - profoundly emotional yet perfectly controlled - each have a chance to display themselves in different ways with each track.  I highly recommend this album to Shakira fans old and new.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of those shows that really didn't the attention it deserved.  Sure, it got a movie even, but still was relatively unknown by even hardcore sci-fi fans.  By mixing both Western and Sci-fi genres, Firefly accomplishes what other shows have only tried and failed at.  A nice looking, well written, funny, action packed, FX'ed western-sci-fi hullaballoo!!! <br /> <br />If you've seen the anime \\"Cowboy Bebop\\" you'll see the similarities almost immediately.  The series was way too short, but in that matter, it's easy to appreciate... accompanied with the film \\"Serenity.\\" <br /> <br />If you're thinking of giving it a shot.  Well, I can't guarantee you'll like it, but I sure did, I'm a chronic Trekky, a Star Wars Junkie, B5 Fan.... this show is a MUST!
B000BNX3AU|5.0|Although some might consider a chick flick, this is a great movie that even my fiance enjoyed.
B00002E224|3.0|I saw this movie when it first came out, but I was in Junior High then or something like that so I thought it was very boring.  But since I'm older, I decided to give it another go.  this time around, it wasn't as boring as I remembered it. It is a movie completely based in conversation...no action, no special effects, no real plot really, just 2 hours of 2 people talking.  I've been there, done that, and usually I at least get my 2 cents in.  Although the characters are engaging, it was frustrating to not be able to be a part of the conversation.  Whats the point of watching a movie with 2 people having a very ordinary conversation when I can do that any day of the week and be the quiet silent one who says nothing all the time.  So if you're bored and lacking of friends on a saturday, this is a good movie. But if you have friends you can go out with and chat with, then by all means go do that.
074322454X|5.0|I liked it because it is an amazing story. Saw HBO's series. With maps an photographs which help you to fully understand the story. Handy edition, good quality of paper, well written with personal testimonies. It is a different approach to History account. Consider that I'm not an american citizen and I perfectly followed the events.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only saw two episodes when Firefly was still on the air, and those two got me hooked. Unfortunately, fate and my job, kept me from following the show. This DVD is a great buy for any Sci-Fi fan. I watch one episode every Friday night with my daughters and they love it.
0805066691|5.0|This book is a \\"Must Read\\" for anyone who cares about empathy for their fellow man. Because \\"Empathy\\" is the ONLY thing that seperates us from the animals. <br /> <br />Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee is NOT Politically Correct, it is the truth seen through the eyes of the American Indian. It's a shame that we have people wanting to diminish the reality of what we did to the American Indian. Any one of you ever hear of the term \\"Manifest Destiny\\"? Well I hate to break it to you but it was NOT an Indian ideal.  <br /> <br />The American Indians may have had their differences but calling them savages was just a \\"white man\\" convenient contrivance to justify their slaughter. If you look at the American Indians at the time, you will find their belief systems to be more in tune with their environment than ours will ever be. Why do you think <br />they sold Manhatten to us for a hand full of beads? Because, as far as they were concerned, Mother Earth belonged to us all, not to any individual(s). While us white men are a blight on Mother Earth the Indians were not. <br /> <br />If this is the only book you read about the American Indian then you are not getting the total picture but let's not diminish the importance of this fine book and author in helping to provide a balanced view of what happened to the American Indian. They were treated like animals, lied to, spread all over kingdom come, then slaughtered. Not the proudest moments in American History. <br /> <br />I for one believe we could have done a much better job of dealing with the Indians than we did. Just another Government organized Brain Surgery using a pickaxe :-(
B00005JOFO|3.0|This movie was based on a short story and Ang Lee pads it to movie length with the longest, slowest introduction.  Beautiful though the Wyoming scenery is the action was like watching paint dry.  A pair of bi-sexual shepherds leave the sheep to their dogs and cayotes and keep warm (very warm)when they discoverlove in a tent.  Heath Ledger (Ennis)maintains an expressionless face, but Jake G's (Jack Twist) beautiful eyes speak volumes.Ennis's only show of emotion that is not based on passion is for his teenage daughter, Alma Jr. His complete lack of compassion, or even decent concern for his long suffering wife makes him an unsympathetic character.  One of the best scenes is the Christmas dinner at Jack Twist's home, where his abominable father in law LB Newsome tries to assume control by carving the turkey.  Jack reveals true backbone, wrests control of the carving knife and the television switch, but later pays with his life. <br /> <br />Question:  Why does the employer of the shepherds continue to give the pair employment when he sees by binoculars evidence of \\"stemming the rose\\" instead of minding the sheep? <br /> <br />
B000ASDFEU|4.0|This is an a very well told version of the \\"Market Garden\\" Operation. It does it in a very political manner, not to offend those who aren't military historians and know all the operational details not told in the movie. But the movie as a whole is excellent. the cast is Loaded with talent and they do their jobs wonderfully. This film is a must have for any WWII movie fan to add to their collection.
B000C3H4MC|5.0|I've just finished listening to this reissue for the first time, and I had to log on and sing its praises, especially in light of the rather picayune reviews that it's already garnered.  Yes, kiddies, digipaks fall apart if you handle them a whole lot and leave your CDs on the floor, and perhaps one of your chosen playback mechanisms hasn't achieved detente with the Dualdisc format.  Spend an extra buck, burn yourself a copy for playing every day, and put the package on your shelf to pull out for the occasional perusal.  After all, you bought this for the MUSIC, right?....    ...Speaking of which, the sound on this is nothing short of revelatory.  I've probably heard this album several hundred times, and I heard details in this new mix that I've never noticed before.  There is so much depth and clarity in the mix that I was transfixed on first listen.  Some highlights: the enhanced imaging on \\"Born Under Punches\\" -- listen to how the bass, guitar and drums create the fiercest syncopated groove-on-groove, a whole new interplay that wasn't properly audible before this version; the vocal layers on \\"The Great Curve\\", with the teeth-sharpening guitar solos of Adrian Belew jumping out of the mix and landing in your lap; and \\"The Overload\\" -- just listen to how the guitar \\"harmonics\\" breathe and flow with the drone backing, and how the phase-cycle of the synth works with the minimal backing rhythms.    I can't comment on the 5.1 mix, not being set up to play it back properly -- someone else will need to chime on on that one.    The bonus tracks are a bit superfluous, although they provide a good insight into the Heads' evolution (after all, think how far they evolved sonically from \\"Fear of Music\\" to this album) and in how they were able to digest and synthesize their new approaches to polyrhythm.    Man oh man, I can't recommend this highly enough.  This album was ahead of its time when it came out, and STILL sounds unlike anything else out there.  I know that \\"ahead of its time\\" is tossed around blithely in record reviews, but this is the real deal -- just imagine this album coming out tomorrow; how would you react upon hearing it?      Thank you, Jerry/Tina/Chris/David, for giving us this and then giving it to us again, in even better form.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of the best Sci-Fi series I've watched; right up there next to Star Trek: Next Generation and Futurama.  The character development flows seemlessly within the episodes, never detracting from the plot.  The comedy is well placed and bountiful, just wait till you see the episode entitled \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds.\\"  Truly worth the money, but apparently not to Fox.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|FOX channel was just completely STUPID for canceling FIREFLY. Joss Whedon (the creator of BUFFY and ANGEL) is one of the most brilliant people ever and FOX make a huge mistake by not giving this show a chance. It's one of the wittiest, smartest shows ever to cross our television screen, and canceling it was the biggest mistake FOX has made since canceling KEEN EDDIE!
B00004DTLJ|5.0|Innocence is no excuse has got to be Saxon's best studio recording ever. <br />All track's are outstanding especially Rockin' Again & my all time favourite Broken Heroes. <br />This is a must for any serious metal fan,or just people who love great music. <br />The 2 bonus tracks off the Crusader album are a fitting ending to a great audio experience. <br />                           ROCK ON
B000002J27|5.0|Genesis answered all questions when Peter Gabriel left the band with a new sound a new lyrical philosophy and it worked.  Better then anyone would have believed.  The songs flow together like fine wine and cheese.  They take you on a trip going from up tempo songs to slow tempo songs and you do not even notice the change in terrain.  As classic rock goes this is a true classic.  From the opening of Dance on a Volcano to the final thump of Los Endos.  This is the CD that would define the sound of Genesis for the rest of their career.

B00005JOQ9|3.0|After the big lie of Spielberg's 'Munich', it's nice to get back to a movie that tells it like it is. However, the soundtrack is clearly wrong for the film and constantly works against it. Take that out completely and you have a perfect dead pan comedy gem.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Living in a rural town, I had failed to see the movie Serenity on the big screen.  Recently, having purchased the movie, I found myself so entertained by it's storyline and rich characters, that I immediately purchased the Firefly series.  What a delightful surprise that was!  Having never seen the shortlived series while it ran on TV, I'm thrilled at now having made the purchase.  I certainly understand why the fans so energetically rallied together for this show.  Thank you, Josh.
B00005614M|4.0|I was ordering some other stuff on Amazon, T.V. on in the background. I heard Lisa Simpson say something about Miles Davis, Birth of the Cool and ordered the CD to get the order over $25 for free shipping or some other impulsive reason.  My third-grade students really enjoyed listening to this CD while they worked on their assignments.  Very accessible jazz and should be in every collection.
0684867621|1.0|I am no longer a Stepehen King fan. I don't dislike his stuff as much as I outgrew it (though Cell does sound interesting.)I picked up \\"...Gordon\\" after years of having moved on from King's novels. Let's just say that I haven't picked one up again and have no desire to. This is writing to make a buck at its finest. The character is weak and only mildly interesting. The story is unsure if it's a tale of horror or one of survival. The payoff is as if King lost interest, decided to throw something together and get back to re-runs of Oprah. The payoff in \\"IT\\" was much the same, however, the characters were so well drawn that you forgave this slight. One of the things that you initially loved about King, which also became increasingly annoying, was his use of hip language and references; his ability to paint characters with the use of dialogue. Either King tried too hard, or not hard enough. And what's with the Tom Gordon reference? Tom Gordon? That's like using Shooty Babitt (Oakland A's fans will know what I'm talking about) in your title. Scrub, just like the story. There's only one good thing about the Red Sox winning the series: Maybe we won't get anymore titles using marginal Sox players as the catalyst for a bad story.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Saw is a must see for any fan of horror movies. I've been hard-pressed to find a truly horrifying horror movie over the last few years, and finally they give us Saw. It was worth the wait. It's mentally thrilling as well as full of gore, particularly if you get the uncut version, which I wish I'd waited for but I'm just too impatient. The uncut version has a cooler cover but it also has more gore to it. After viewing the uncut version (which my best friend has) it was easy to see why they cut some of those scenes to make it more movie-friendly for those who are too squeamish. You'll have a lot of fun trying to figure out the game in this movie, and when the ending comes you'll be quite surprised. At least I was. I made my best friend check all my closets after this one, but if I told you why it would give away the ending. Not just recommended...mandatory for horror fans everywhere.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This album is one of their best. But all of their albums are fantastic. I haven't found a single fault with this band (oh alright, I don't really like their 'knowledge' song on their first album) but get this one! It has some really good songs like Waiting, Warning and Minority. And, Minority has a positive message in the words. It is standing your ground, standing up for yourself and what you believe in, whether you are the majority or minority. It encourages freedom of expression/speech which is what I encourage too. This is such a fantastic album.
B00005JLSE|1.0|This was pure trash. Not even remotely interesting or entertaining. Ok, I take that back -- I liked the puppet number. Otherwise, trash.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|The bad news is the uncut extended version is no very different from the normal one and the extras don't last very long. <br />The good part is that the book is excellent, so for the money you pay it is worth having the DvD And this wondefull book. If you are a fan of sin city, this is a good buy.
B000002KOG|5.0|Neil Young's first album after he left Buffalo Springfield is packed with great music. From acoustic guitar to heavy rock & roll Young proves he can do it all.  The only other musician around who is as versitile, of course is Dylan. With this Neil Young proves his worth.  What most prople didn't know was that this record was just the beginning of something memorable.  \\"Sugar Mountain\\" stands out, as does \\"Last Trip to Tulsa.\\"   This album is a keeper.
B00005AFVR|3.0|I will start this review with the only complaint that can I can muster when discussing any live recording of Bruce and the E Street band. After the monumental perfection of the Live 1975-85 collection, much of this is extraneous or redundant. Springsteen is as focused and energized as always and the E Street Band plays with the same fervor that has established their reputations as an unbeatable live act. Because some of these songs have grown so familiar, though, the moody intensity of their studio counterparts is compromised, particularly on the most reflective tunes. \\"Prove It All Night\\" is all bombast, as is \\"Two Hearts,\\" but they lean heavily on familiarity, while the latter suffers from a contrived ending that incorporates Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's \\"It Takes Two.\\" The energy is monumental, though, which helps to make the mellower songs that much more effective. \\"Mansion on the Hill\\" works beautifully, with gentle waves of pedal-steel guitar wafting behind the melody like a soft breeze over a field of wheat. \\"The River\\" suffers, though, because it is too drawn out and loses its central vision as a portrayal of lost innocence, sounding instead like the dim reflections of a middle-aged man. Springsteen is an honest performer, so I'm certain this is not an oversight. It's only that the aging process forces things to be re-assessed, and not everything works in this revised context. \\"Youngstown\\" is another misfire, with a ton of musical muscle to propel it, but without the vulnerable poignancy that made the original work so well. \\"Murder Inc.\\" and \\"Badlands\\" are two songs that demand a tough, hard-as-nails energy, and they both get the treatment they deserve here.<br /><br />The first few tracks on the second disk capture the true essence of Springsteen and the E Street Band. A gospel-drenched version of \\"10th Avenue Freeze Out\\" lingers for a full 16 minutes, with an extended band introduction and an ending salvo that could rupture your spleen. Following this are the collections two new songs. \\"Land of Hopes and Dreams\\" takes ten minutes to unfurl, but it proves itself to be one of Springsteen's most powerful and hopeful songs. Even though it carries a distinct pre-9/11 sensibility, it still resounds strongly, perhaps even more so. Much, much darker is the other new song. \\"American Skin (41 Shots)\\" confronts the grim reality that occurs when fear and tension collide. Instead of pointing his finger, Springsteen concludes, \\"We're all baptized in these waters and in each other's blood.\\" It is our society; hence we are all to blame when a victim dies at the hands of society's representatives. It's a heavy conclusion, but not one that should be controversial, since it conveys a very simple truth.<br /><br />The six tracks that did not make the HBO special finish out the album with more of a whimper than a bang. Each of these performances are good, but nothing revelatory, making it apparent why the show editors saw fit to edit them from the final video cut. As a fan of Springsteen who always looks for the best qualities in his catalog of work, I can say that this live collection is good, but there are better places to turn. If you care to hear the raw power of the E Street Band and the personal conviction of Springsteen as a live performer, pick up Live 1975-85, since it remains one of the best live documents of a rock and roll performer ever released.

B000002J0P|5.0|Some albums simply define the times in which they were made, and this happens to be one of those albums. Whatever you might think about the late `60s hippie movement, there's no denying that it provided the perfect groundwork for idealistic expression, and you will find a near-perfect representation of those ideals and beliefs on this album. By 1969, hippie idealism had morphed into skepticism while the youth movement became politicized. Somehow - almost miraculously - Crosby, Stills and Nash walked the fine line between idealistic faith and political activism. At the time, it really did seem like we could change the world, and this album provided the soundtrack, and the impetus, for the spirit of change. While the stage at Woodstock was being built, this album played in near-constant rotation, which is a perfect metaphor for what this album truly represents.<br /><br />Individually, David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash had credentials that virtually guaranteed some degree of success. Crosby had recently been unceremoniously booted from the Byrds, Graham Nash was looking for a way out of the pop-music trap that the Hollies had become, and Stephen Stills was recovering after his previous semi-supergroup Buffalo Springfield splintered into matchsticks. Different backgrounds and radically different personality types made for interesting musical combinations, especially since they all wrote music, but taken together, the combination was nearly lethal. Vocally, they were a unit, or to paraphrase \\"Helplessly Hoping\\", they were for each other. Stephen Stills took control of the sessions for this album, and he provided most of the instrumentation on each track. Four decades on, I now hear that the basic music tracks are a bit claustrophobic, but their voices disguise this so well that it has taken me four decades to even consider the production techniques that were used.<br /><br />Nearly forty years later, it is obvious that some songs have held up better than others. Virtually everything written by Stephen Stills still sounds fresh, inventive and original. No matter how many times I hear \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\", I will always feel compelled to sing along, while \\"Helplessly Hoping\\" and \\"You Don't Have to Cry\\" are only marginally less stunning in their originality. Crosby's tunes have aged a bit, especially the anthemic `shot-over-the-bow' polemics of \\"Long Time Gone,\\" but \\"Guinnevere\\" has retained its odd individualistic charm. The Graham Nash songs don't fare as well. \\"Pre-Road Downs\\" has grown dated, while \\"Marrakesh Express\\" has become one of the most vilified pop songs of the post-hippie era (Iggy Pop referred to it as one of the worst songs he ever heard). Taken as a package, though, \\"Crosby, Stills and Nash\\" is a time-capsule item that stands solidly on all three legs.<br /><br />It might sound a bit ridiculous, but there is one tiny complaint that I have with this otherwise superb re-issue. I have played the original vinyl album so often that every nuance has been committed to memory, and I'm certain that many others have done so perhaps even more than me. Fanatics will surely remember the short bit before \\"49 Bye-Byes\\" where David Crosby riffs a vocal line from Robert Johnson's \\"Come On In My Kitchen.\\" It is missing here, and I sense its absence every time the CD reaches that point. To compensate for this gaffe, the disk provides four extra tracks, including a gorgeous version of Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talking\\", so I'll consider it a fair exchange.<br /><br />A  Tom Ryanually everything written by Stephen Stills still sounds fresh, inventive and original.

Taken as a package, though, \\"Crosby, Stills and Nash\\" is a time-capsule item that stands solidly on all three legs. <br />It might sound a bit ridiculous, but there is one tiny complaint that I have with this otherwise superb re-issue. I have played the original vinyl album so often that every nuance has been committed to memory, and I'm certain that many others have done so perhaps even more than me. Fanatics will surely remember the short bit before \\"49 Bye-Byes\\" where David Crosby riffs a vocal line from Robert Johnson's \\"Come On In My Kitchen.\\" It is missing here, and I sense its absence every time the CD reaches that point. To compensate for this gaffe, the disk provides four extra tracks, including a gorgeous version of Fred Neil's \\"Everybody's Talking\\", so I'll consider it a fair exchange. <br />A  Tom Ryan
0307276902|1.0|So, Why can't I call Frey a fraud?    I find this hype all very funny.  I work at a bookstore which explains the bookseller after my name and we sold so many copies of this we sold out twice.  I picked up the book because of the same hype and I was intrigued by the unique writing style.  However, I didn't think the style would stay the same through the whole book.  I thought that the writing would get better as he recovered and that he wrote in short choppy sentences to reflect his drug induced state.  Well, I was wrong.      First off his parents save him from the airport and he agrees to go into a drug rehab center.  All he talks about for half the book is throwing up and getting clean clothes.  His little trip to the dentist without any painkillers was not as greatly written or as heroic as I heard.  I really didn't care whether he got better and I just wanted the book to end.    It is so sad that people read this simply because Opera recommended it.  I respect Opera for who she is, but a literary genuis is not one of those things.  I think it is great that she is getting people to read the classics, things that have been out for years, I just find it lame that people will read anything she says to.    In this day and age where I had a young girl ask me if Pride and Prejudice is out in the book yet because the movie was so great, I just wish more people would read and not because they saw it on TV or the movie screen.
B00005JOFO|4.0|Funny and sad how some \\"reviewers\\" here showed their hatred towards this movie simply because of their ideology.  It was pretty obvious that some people who hate this movie did not even see the movie.  What is the point of turning this section into a preaching opportunity?????  Ang Li has said before that he did not make this movie to make a statement.  It is a movie, a piece of cinema work, and it should be reviewed just like a movie, with open mind. <br /> <br />I saw the movie and read the original story.  I think the director and the actors did a very good job, except that I thought the editing was a bit choppy.  It is not just about men, it is about women too (Michelle William's role is just as heart wrenching as the relationship between Enis and Jack).   <br /> <br />Being a metro gay man myself, yes it is easier for me to feel the connection, yet most of my straight friends, male or female, think this is a really well made movie as well, forget about who agrees on the gay issue or not.  The true matter is the movie is good.  It is on my top three list for 2005 but not the top two.  In a way, I guess because I am a gay boy, I am somewhat used to the issue.  I rank this movie behind \\"Capote\\" and \\"The Constant Gardener\\" for the year.  That's why I did not give it a five star.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This album  is hard to even put down in words. I am very big into Fall Out Boy, they may be on Mtv, but I loved them before and still love them now. The comparison of Panic! at the disco to Fall out boy, particularly Pete Wentz, is somewhat strange to me. I don't deny they have a seemingly similiar sound, yet their musical tastes and influences clearly are not of the same genre at all. Panic! at the disco derives its sound from synthetic beats and rhythms ,lustful words, and catchy choruses. Fall out Boy is more up front and in your face, singing of how \\"you look so good in blue\\" and having lyrics on a lesser peppy scale. Not to discredit the boys at all. <br /> <br />Getting away from the FOB/P!ATD compare and contrast, I think Panic! at the Disco has truely done with A fever you Can't Sweat Out what is so rare in the alternative music industry today: Create a unique sound. Not only are their lyrics flabbergastingly insightful and creative, the voices which bring them to listeners are incredible and perfectly fitting. <br /> <br />As I read in someone else's review--to rate each song would be somewhat tedious and altogetherr useless, seeing as how I am madly in love with each and every tune. <br /> <br />The more popular songs include \\"Time To Dance\\", \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom And Suicide Is Press Coverage\\", and \\"I write Sins not Tragedies.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Only difference...\\", for me, at least has become through myspace/xanga/etc. and alternative music sites become a little overplayed, a sort of \\"Sugar, we're going down\\" effect. However, if you haven't heard it, give it a listen, 'cause it's well worth it. <br /> <br />\\"Time to Dance\\" is simply fabulous. Starting out with a girl bleeding on the dance floor, you are immediately interested, and would be dissapointed at its conclusion, yet the promise of the next song keeps you going. <br /> <br />\\"I write Sins not tragedies\\" is as I see it, hilarious. It describes a wedding where the bride is being talked of in a rather discrediting light. Listen to it, you won't regret it. <br /> <br />The Introduction sets the stage for the crazy rhythms and mayhem of the album well, and the intermission provides an eerie midpoint rest for listeners. <br /> <br />\\"Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off\\" is becoming quite the hit on the internet, and I can see why. It's basically saying, you won't someone as good as me. This one makes me dance like crazy. <br /> <br />My other favorites are \\"Camisado\\", a purely original tune, and \\"Build God, then We'll Talk\\" which I actually want to be played at like, my wedding. Not exactly the greatest lyrics for a wedding, but I really couldn't care less. <br /> <br />All in all, you will love this album. Despite what I or anyone else on here says, you really must listen to it yourself to understand the genius that is Panic! at the Disco. <br /> <br />the local cd store waits... <br /> <br /> <br />

B00009UW0N|5.0|1978 seemed like any ordinary year, until Halloween that is.<br /><br />Not the holliday mind you, the movie. True horror movies are rare. Anyone can make a gory slasher film that has no redeeming value, but has lots of breasts and lots of sex.<br /><br />But to make a true, dyed in the wool horror movie takes talent, skill, luck, and a love of storytelling. John Carpenter has all of these. And while he may not allways use all of them (Village of the damned anyone?) he certainly uses most of them, and in this film he uses all of them, to create one of the most memprable screen villans of all time. In fact, next to Norman Bates, The MOST copied screen villan of all time. Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, My Bloody Valentine, Sleepaway Camp? All copycats, some good, most not. Horror, quite simply, has never been this good again. Oh sure, some films have come close, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was scary as hell, but it relied on a visceral feel and quality that harply contrasts with Halloween's dark, moody atmosphere, and music that niggles in your brain and puts you on edge without even breaking a sweat. Carpenter gets everything right with this movie, Casting, set design, tone, feel, atmosphere, the music, the editing, everything falls in place for this most respected of his films. Starman was nominated for Academy Awards, but this one should have won a few. The only thing missing is Kurt Russell, otherwise, this would be THE John Carpenter film. The one to mold, put in a time capsul, and make sure the entire universe saw it.<br /><br />If you have never seen it, you are doing yourself a disservice. If you are a fan of horror, good horror, then buy it immediately, put it in the DVD player, turn off the lights, and get some popcorn. It may be old enough to be cheesy, and more than a little cliched by now, but at the time it was created, this was all fresh.<br /><br />the \\"Good Girl\\" virgin who seems prudish, but manages to evade the Villian, falling down repeatedly while running, the killer who cant be killed, if you have sex you're a victim waiting to happen, it you smoke pot or drink beer, you are going to be done in, the doomsayer no one listens too. All of it started here. A masterpiece. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.ing, the killer who cant be killed, if you have sex you're a victim waiting to happen, it you smoke pot or drink beer, you are going to be done in, the doomsayer no one listens too.

B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is just what my title says...It is an amazing debut album by four very talented individuals. These four guys click immediately and one would think they had been making music together for years!! The rage sound is still there, but Cornell blends in very well, witout losing his signature sound. Almost all of the tracks on this album are great below is a brief review... <br />1)Cochise- a great way to open the album,drving music, great scream from Chris at the end. 8/10 <br />2)Show me how to live- another catchy song, a little too radio friendly for me... 6/10 <br />3)Gasoline- a decent track very reminicent of Soundgarden 7/10 <br />4)What you are- one of my least favorite on the album..just drags on too long for me 6/10 <br />5)Like A Stone- A very good song with an amazing solo from Tom 9/10 <br />6)Set It Off- Another great track, fast paced one of my favorites, almost the anthem of the cd. 8/10\ <br />7)Shadow on the sun- In my opinion, the best track on the album. The music is amazing, building from slow, to an amazing solo from Morello, followed by Cornell screaming his ass off 10/10 <br />8) I Am The Highway- A great ballad that shows how Chris has advanced from his soundgarden days. 9/10 <br />9)Exploder- Interesting song, interesting lyrics, decent vocals but not much in the music department 8/10 only because of Cornell <br />10)Hypnotize- another of my least favorites..its a kind of Cornell doing spoken word and I agree witht he other reviewers... 5/10 <br />11)Bring Em Back Alive- not very good, filler in my opinion 5/10 <br />12)Light My Way- another good track, with one of Cornells best vocal performances on the album 8/10 <br />13)Getaway Car- Astounding blues track, unlike anything that Rage has done and Chris does some interesting vocal acrobatics on the chorus. My second favorite 10/10 <br />14)The Last Remaining Light- A great way to end the cd, kinda serves as book ends with cochise. A powerful opening track contrasted by a more mellow closer. 9/10  <br />Overall, 10 of the 14 tracks are really good and 6 of those 10 are amazing. Easily one of the best cd's in the last decade.
1573223085|4.0|You might be judge Alito, or you might be a couch potato.  But all of you out there might find it helpful to read A Whole New Mind by Daniel Pink, Al Gore's former chief speechwriter, the guy who also wrote Free Agent Nation. <br />  <br />Like all faddish books, the book proposes nothing short of a revolution about the way we conceptualize our work in the near future.  Abundance, Automation, Asia(in no particular order), the authors claims, are taking away all the left-brain white collar jobs.  The future belongs to those R-Directed people.  The future belongs to people who has highly developed senses of design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning.   <br />  <br />The author seems to suggest that the information age will also come to pass just like its predecessor, the industrial age, and still further, the agricultural age.  And then follows the conceptual age will eliminate quite a number of jobs.  This might sound alarmist, but think of what Bill Ford has done to families and families of workers who used to think that Ford means security.   <br />  <br />However, terms like the information age, conceptual age are innately problematic.  If you are 20 this year, you cannot be 19 like last year.  Information age, conceputal age, etc do not work this way.  People use these metaphorically, but still, they mislead.  These ages are rather waves of development.  Or rather, to use the author's own term, it is a symphony of various sectors at play at all ages.   <br />  <br />This being said, you might still find the book insightful.  You can always take the views with a grain of salt, and you don't have to accept any of its conclusions, but these six senses really help you to see things that unfold before you in ways you never see before.  It's the Joshua's tree epiphany. <br />  <br />Yesterday, I heard a talk on the radio.  A guy called in to the radio host, and the host asks: \\"What do you do for a living?\\" The guy answers:\\"I an instructional designer designingtraining materials for the corporate setting.\\" The host snapped:\\"I am sorry for you.\\"   <br />  <br />I am sorry for the host too, for carrying his old mind.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I bought this cd for the single \\"Home\\" which i thought was great.  \\"Home\\" was the only song of its kind on this album.  Buble is very jazzy and sounds much like Sinatra.

1932907009|5.0|Safe the Cat faces the marketing truth we have in the feature flicks world nowadays. It shamelessly does so. I understand that many \\"art\\" directors will take \\"Safe the Cat\\" as a great insult. That someone actually dares to standup and say it out loud how main stream films are built and created. There is a reason why they are main stream. <br /> <br />Well, folks, this is what's happening. This is the system that works. There is a reason why world local films are dropping and the likes of Batman and co are taking over. Despite my artistic arrogance as a independent filmmaker - I realized when I read the book, that it's just that. Arrogance. That I needed to read this and study hard, if I ever wanted to learn to brake the rules and evolve as a filmmaker. This book greatly shows us what's under the blanket. And more importantly shows us all the tools. <br /> <br />I could ramble on about how Blake tells this in a funny, entertaining way, but that's just the icing on the cake. What was a pleasant surprise from other books is that Blake does not put his ego in there. He's always \\"aside\\" kindly showing us the equipment with motherly warmness in his words. These rules have been there since we were cavemen, even your own mother used them when she was telling you made-up stories before bedtime.  <br /> <br />And in that sense, it's like a spiritually book for me. It shows me how things really are. And on top of that, the book is in plain English. Syd Field is good, but too blurry and general. And Blake is approachable, he actually dares you to challenge him, even gives his email address for people to contact and does a great follow-up on his theories on his website. <br /> <br />I do documentaries and always use a feature 100 min structure, and that's even more difficult than the features, where you can control things. I'm stepping into my first fiction this year, and this book gave me the map to fix and adjust my script, giving me ideas on how to experiment on the rules.  <br /> <br />It also gave me a great deal of confidence. I realized that I know all the rooms in the house, this book told me which is which. <br /> <br />So, if any of you kids out there mean business, if you really want to learn, instead of thinking that you're \\"better than Hollywood\\" - you're in for years of misery if you don't study this. I'm happy my suffering only lasted 10 years.
B00005JOQ9|1.0|Damn, what a waste of money.  I was so disappointed by this movie.  It didn't live up to a fraction of all the hype that they were promoting for it in the beginning of the year.  All I can say is that I hope Tarantino is taking this Eli Roth under his tutelage and training the guy tofinally produce something of half decent worth.  I will spare the readers here the already mentioned reasons but fuffice to say that this movie was not in the horro genre but some really bad cut and paste job from a theme here and a variation there from other movies from the past and done with no real seamless connection.  Some of the scenes were truly horrible in terms of the acting and dialogue and cheesy sex scenes.  As for the \\"horror,\\" showing how a chainsaw works on a human body really isn't a horror scene but just a bit gross.  And it's been done already so many times and cannot emulate the classic Chainsaw Massacre, which first introduced the genre.  Hostel is just a sad 90 minute long exercise in a total lack of imagination on the part of its writer and producer, Eli Roth.
0780020685|5.0|Seven Samurai is a definite must for anyone would likes Japanese Origins in anyway what so ever, or just a flat out good movie. Sure its really old and kinda hard to get into because of that but its still really great once you give it a chance. For a movie that is over 50 years old the action is pretty good. Its a must see unless your one of those people who is not the slightest bit open and cant watch anything old or anything thats not all action..that kind of stupid stuff. Just see it =)
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie is simply wonderful! For the Pride and Prejudice fans, you will see that Richard Armitage would make a perfect Mr. Darcy! It's a wonderful adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's work focusing on the differences between the genteel life in the southern part of England and the harsher life of the mill workers in the northern part of England. The characters come to life and by the end you understand them better and really feel for them. Daniela Denby-Ashe does a superb job as Margaret Hale and Richard Armitage romances you as John Thornton.

In 1966, I went down to... <br /> <br />This movie was probably thought of and concieved under that sink. This is pathetic! I would rather floss my teeth with Roseanne Arnold's gstring than be forced to sit through this lame piece of boring crap. Those of you who actually laugh at this stuff are in serious need of a qualified team of dedicated and trained deprogrammers. NOT ONE really funny line through the whole thing and the music isn't good enough for AM radio in any era. Instead of buying in this DVD rent it first. If you really do like it try snorting about a half can of Ronson lighter fluid and go sit by the fireplace.

The voices are great for the charactors and the animation is also great. overall one of disney's newest classic's the film is great to watch over and over again.

The story is about the unpredicatble, powerful forces of love in an uncertain and turbulant time.

B00005JNRE|5.0|\\"When you need me, but do not want me, then I will stay. When you want me, but do not need me, then I have to go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nanny McPhee\\", the new film written by and starring Emma Thompson, and the producers of \\"Love Actually\\" and \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", is a delightful film, suitable for the entire family. Even if you don't have kids, this film should help bring back memories of all of the great children's books you read and loved.<br /><br />Cedric Brown (Colin Firth, \\"Love Actually\\"), the hapless father of seven children and a recent widower finds his family falling apart. Unable to spend much time at home, he works long hours trying to keep his funeral parlor afloat, leaving the children in the care of nannies, a scullery maid, Evangeline (Kelly McDonald, \\"Love Actually\\") and a cook (Imelda Staunton, \\"Vera Drake\\"). The children, lead by Simon (Thomas Sangster, \\"Love Actually\\"), are an unruly bunch and take great pride in their ability in scaring all of the nannies away. They realize they have set a new record. It only took 3 hours and 14 minutes to get rid of Nanny #17. Distraught, Cedric finds that the Village Nanny agency will no longer help him. Then, Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson), a snaggle-toothed, overweight woman with two moles on her face, shows up at the door. She immediately begins to teach the children how to behave, using a mixture of magic, common-sense and insight. Soon, Great Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) arrives and insists that Cedric marry again, or she will no longer provide support to the family. It is up to the children and Nanny McPhee to make things right.<br /><br />Emma Thompson has proven she has a great deal of skill writing screenplays. First, the adaptation of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and now \\"Nanny McPhee\\". Blending the best elements and ideas from successful family films, without a huge amount of treacle or gaggles of children running wild, Thompson has created a delightful story sure to appeal to young and old. Parents should run to the closest theater playing this film, with or without their children, steering clear of films like \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\". Set in an indeterminate time, I am going to guess the early 1900s, due to the lack of telephones, televisions and radios, and the clothing; the film is set in a sleepy country village in England. The family home, a rambling Victorian with many gables, has seen better days, is filled with bright colors peeling in many places, mismatched furniture and toys, is very messy, but it feels like home. The time and place add immeasurably to the fanciful nature of the film and help to transport us to this fantasy world.<br /><br />Emma Thompson is also very good as the mysterious Nanny McPhee. Comparisons to \\"Mary Poppins\\" will be inevitable, but Thompson makes this character slightly unique by adding humor to the role. She is magical and pops up to address other characters with no notice, driving poor Mr. Brown (Firth) a little batty. Startling him, she always apologizes by saying \\"I did knock\\", which soon becomes a funny joke. She is also stern, but not mean, and unwilling to put up with any of the children's shenanigans. Of course, she is there to teach the children how to behave, they are an extremely unruly group, and she does this with a mixture of insight, kindness and tough love. When the children claim to have the measles, she soon serves them a viscous \\"Measles Medicine\\" which is sure to cure them of playing sick in the future. Early on, she announces to Mr. Brown that she has five lessons to teach the children, if they should learn more that is up to them. Clearly, they learn a lot more.<br /><br />Colin Firth is equally amusing as the battle weary father. He is funny at times, but his role is more the romantic, as he has to find a woman to marry, to ensure that they continue to receive Aunt Adelaide's money. Initially, he decides upon Selma Quickly (Celia Imrie), the widow of one of his clients, and is prepared to go through with the marriage to this hideous woman, until the children come to the rescue. Colin Firth has long played the dashing romantic lead and this persona works well here. When he finds the situation slipping out of his control, his haggard nature is funnier because Firth is usually a romantic lead. To watch this dashing figure deal with a gaggle of unruly children, yet also pine for his lost wife, Firth is extremely effective making us feel for his character.<br /><br />Kelly McDonald is also quite good as Evangeline, the young woman who works for the family, but also cares for the children and cares for Mr. Brown as well. Derek Jacobi, Imelda Staunton and Angela Lansbury round out the cast of amusing characters.<br /><br />Of the children, the most notable is Simon, played by Thomas Sangster (Liam Neeson's son in \\"Love Actually\\"). He is quite good at leading the unruly children into mischief. He also, ultimately, becomes the one who will make the choice to make everything right again.<br /><br />\\"Nanny McPhee\\" is like watching a great children's book come to life. The time, setting and feel of everything in the film help to make the magical elements believable and this helps to make everything more enjoyable and interesting. The story is predictable, you will probably be able to guess the final outcome, but \\"Nanny\\" takes us on an unpredictable journey to this conclusion.<br /><br />The children in \\"Nanny\\" are as destructive as the kids in \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\", and other films of that nature, but these children learn real lessons, and help make real changes in their life. It seems more real, which given the fantasy elements of the film, is remarkable. Everything in \\"Cheaper\\" is just so phony and unnatural it resembles a big cartoon and any lessons those children might learn seem superficial. Nanny McPhee teaches them real lessons, lessons they will need in life, lessons that will make a difference in their life.<br /><br />When Nanny McPhee first meets Mr. Brown and the children, she tells them \\"When you need me, but do not want me, then I will stay. When you want me, but do not need me, then I have to go\\". Well, Nanny McPhee, we need you. We need you. Don't go. Tell us more stories.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I did not realize how much I would enjoy Firefly!  The writing is terrific, just when you think you have one of the characters figured out, they do something unexpected. Bitter Captain Reynolds does what needs to be done to survive  but will occasionaly choose to do what's right at the expense of a possible job.  His second in command and combat buddy Zoe is the toughest woman on television.  The blending of the rest of the cast makes for interesting storylines above the plot.  You will however have to watch the movie Serenity to see what River Tamm can do!  Too bad the series was cancelled.
B000AXSN5G|3.0|CD was average. Nice to hear from Neil Young again, but I was expecting more of his \\"old sound\\".
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Yes, this movie is very long and it does take a while for anything to really happen as far as action goes. But from the very beginning of this movie I knew right off it was going to be really good. The way he shows New York city during the 1930's was very impressive. I looked my hardest for even the tiniest mistake in the computer animation but could not find any, I had a hard time telling whether or not it was CGI at first. I actually liked the first 45 minutes of this movie and think Jackson does a very good job of setting the mood and build up to the first action sequence. The action in the is movie is unbelievable, and the CGI is some of the best I have seen in a long time, probably since \\"The return of the king\\". Somehow Jackson has figured out the correct way to combine action and CGI without leaving the viewer bored or laughing at just how fake it looks. He does the action scenes the correct way and you will not be able to stop looking at the screen. You won't find yourself looking at your watch or yawning wishing it would just end. I definitely think this movie needs to be seen on the big screen to really be enjoyed properly. Better catch it before it is gone.
0307276902|5.0|Not since reading reviews of Catch 22 CD's have I ever been so frustrated by the ignorance of the internet crowd (Amazon in particular).<br /><br />Simply put: James Frey lied. I figured he was lying from the first paragraph. It's pretty obvious. I still read the book, enjoyed it and recommended it despite the hyperbole. It seems to me that everyone who read this book and spat on it are either gullible morons or uptight book critics born with a silver spoon up their butt.<br /><br />If you disliked this book because of the grammar and punctuation (done on purpose, might I add, as a tool to feel like you are inside the head of the narrator rather than a spectator), you have lived a sheltered and clean life. Even if some of it was fiction (keep in mind most of it is still true), many of the rehab and drug stories are honest and true-to-life. I have many friends who have lived the life of a crack-addict and identified with the stories Frey told. Too many ignorant people are looking at the author, publisher and editor and their credibilities rather than the actual story. Get over your upturned noses and overly critical minds and enjoy the book for what it is: a book. Go figure, it's a book. Sometimes idiots forget that books aren't always about spectacular editting or phenomenal English. If a book makes you think or entertains you, that's more than enough.<br /><br />Grow up and act like adults for a change.<br /><br />P.S. Oprah was just trying to make Frey look bad; I felt sorry for the guy, to be honest. I've learned to stop listening to her and Dr. Phil and make my own educated and emphathetic social decisions.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanescence broke onto the Top 40 charts with their self-penned Christian-tinged alternative rock smash \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" a almost eerie Linkin Park-sounding track first featured in the film Daredevil; lead band member and head vocalist Amy Lee's trademark Gothic howl only added to the song's appeal.  Fallen, their debut album, became one of 2003's best-selling and most critically acclaimed works, even garnering a coveted gold Grammy.  Every song here has the same elements heard in their No. 1 debut \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" from Lee's powerful delivery to driving metal-rockin' guitar.  \\"My Immortal\\" is featured here in two formats, the album version and, at the very end, a special radio mix that was chosen as a single.  Definitely a great purchase for any music fan, young and old.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This is one of the best releases in the genre.  These guys do it as good or better than anyone else in the metal world right now.  You have great songwriting, and thats what sets them apart from most of the crowd. <br /> <br />There is definitely a trend here.  No one can deny that if you have a Killswitch album album you're likely to dig unearth.  The list goes on and on, but whats wrong with that as long as there is some origninality in the song writing.  As long as I don't think I'm hearing a specific metallica riff, or lyrics almost exactly like pantera I'm alright.  And I coudn't pin down any particular song with these guys. <br /> <br />So if you're not jaded on metal core hardcore whatever other label people come up with, then check this album out because its a legitimate part of good heavy metal
B0009SS00A|5.0|I think that the book is better than most of the reviews that have been given. It is possible that some people are reading out of the genre that they are interested in. Dan Brown is a fiction conspiracy novelist. If you find conspiracies offensive and silly, then there is a good chance that this book will bring in under three stars. If you are into secret societies, secret governments, and religious twists, then this book and every other Dan Brown book will get a four to five star rating from the reader.  <br /> <br />I gave it a five because I couldn't put it down. I didn't like the intimate ending, but every book has flaws. Some of the NSA fact is fiction and some of the fiction is actually fact. Most people would read this and think that it is beyond possible, but the things discussed in this book are reality. It is ahead of its time. I mean now, in 2006, we have public reports of the NSA tapping into civilian phone lines without a warrant.

B0000047CX|5.0|The CD is like listening to the record - which I purchased in 1963 when it was first issued and still have in mint condition!  Excellent.  It is important for any Bossa Nova collector to have this CD - it was the first we ever heard \\"The Girl from Ipenema.\\"  It was awesome to our young virgin ears in those days.  Getz/Gilberto combo showed the masses what enjoyment there was in this type of music.  Buy this and never let it go!!

B000BOH8XW|3.0|Ok. I absolutely adored \\"Laundry Service,\\" Shakira's first English album. It was one of my favourite CDs of the year it was released (2002?), and some of the songs on that album are among my favourites of all time.<br /><br />This album is lacking in something. Sure, it's good, but the punchy attitude from the tracks on \\"Laundry Service\\" is missing. Shakira sounds uninspired on some of the tracks, and some are very boring and dull. What happened to the attitude filled Shakira, that showed through in songs like \\"Objection (Tango),\\" \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" and \\"Rules\\"?<br /><br />Of course, there are some brilliant tracks on the album. One of these is the genius of \\"Hey You.\\" This track is quirky, upbeat and fun, like her previous album. It contains the classic strange Shakira lyrics (about being the zipper of a pair of jeans and the such), and is very catchy and fun to sing along to. Another excellent track is \\"Animal City.\\" I liked this song on the first listen, another quirky song about being rich, and having people suddenly be your friend and surrounding you. More classic Shakira lyrics, crazy music and a catchy hook and chorus. Other highlights are \\"Costume Makes The Clown\\" and \\"How Do You Do.\\"<br /><br />Apart from that, the album is quite bland. I'm being quite generous with 3 stars, purely because I think Shakira is very talented and amazing, and she did produce the entire album. Good try Shakira, but better luck next time.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|I was looking forward to this movie, but it's not nearly as good as the series.  It is predictible, the \\"big shock\\" at the end is underwhelming, and the fight scenes are so mediocre that even the fights on \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel\\" seem Matrix-worthy in comparison. Overall I feel like the plot is structured in a way that makes it harder for people who'd never seen the show to get into the movie.  There's some snappy dialogue, but the final death in the movie was cruel and unnecessary and it made me pretty mad.  But to be fair, this was the one part that WASN'T predictable, and that's exactly how Whedon wanted it.  His commentary track is uncharacteristically boring; most of it is taken up by talk of camera lenses and other sleep-inducing technical details I could care less about, and the the rest of it is \\"I love this shot, and this piece of music, and this actor and that actor\\" on and on and on.  He's usually much more interesting on commentary so I don't know what happened there.<br /><br />There's also not much character development here, and what little we get is truncated due to the need to spur the plot towards its disappointing conclusion.  One would think that fans of the show would be let down by that, but I guess not.  The DVD extras are pretty dull in general and generally not worth the time it takes to watch them.<br /><br />That's all fairly negative, so why the three-star review?  Well, it's mostly out of loyalty to Joss Whedon.  I am a huge fan of his work, and my general motto is that \\"Anything you can do, Joss Whedon can do better.\\"  I think he's done better things than \\"Firefly\\" and this movie, but I respect and admire his passion for this work.  This movie is proof that passion -- from Whedon, his cast and all the \\"browncoat\\" die hard fans -- can move mountains, or at least get movies made.  And I think that's great news.  I certainly hope that if nothing else, all the people who like \\"Firefly\\" who weren't Whedon fans before will jump on the bus and help make all his future projects more successful.  This one wasn't, and I think the bad news is that its lack of success may have a lot to do with the fact that this movie simply wasn't that great.  And that's really too bad because Joss Whedon is very capable of greatness.  But I'm not worried, because I'll be watching whatever he does, so when the greatness comes back, I'll be right there, waiting.uture projects more successful.  This one wasn't, and I think the bad news is that its lack of success may have a lot to do with the fact that this movie simply wasn't that great.

B00097A5I6|1.0|We waited 3 years for this!! After all the talk, and fuss over re scheduling studio time, scrapping songs, and deciding not to work with The death in vegas producers from the start - they went to LA of all places and got Dave Sardy-  producer of System of a Down and Marilyn Manson to record this lump of cheese unimaginatley titled \\"Don't Beleive The Truth.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Lyla\\" the first single was beyond dissapointing, in fact it was the biggest piece of crap I've ever heard, a horrible commcercial sounding song, much like the rest of the singles. <br />Of course even though all the songs are actually complete rubbish, Noels are still worth a listen (Mucky Fingers, Part Of The Queue - the best on the whole album), which is why he should write all the songs on each album, unfortunatley he has'nt, which is why every album since \\"Be Here Now\\" has been patchy and sketchy. <br /> <br />Liams songs are awful as always, \\"You turn me on, loves like a bomb blowing my mind\\" and the horrendous \\"Guess God thinks I'm able\\" which ends in the most disgusting explosion of that crappy production sound and Liam blurting out \\"C'mon lets make it tonight\\" - what the???? <br /> <br />One other reviewer said that it sounds like an old car, which is only true, ultimatley one of the biggest dissapointments, perhaps its time they got Owen Morris to produce them again.
0316172324|5.0|This book is a good introduction to the hidden powers of the mind. It's an easy read and goes over several examples of our unconscious at work. If you are looking for something more in-depth on the topic check out \\"Hare Brain Tortoise Mind.\\"
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Just adding my voice to the legion of Firefly/Serenity fans who have already commented, since fan support is what got the movie made in the first place.  <br /> <br />Of course we will give Serenity a good review, but most of the professional critics really liked this film, particularly in comparison with the aging Star Wars franchise. Forget about the \\"sci-fi western\\" crap you may have heard. This is old-fashioned storytelling with fully developed characters you can care about.  <br /> <br />See Serenity. If you get caught up in the story, then buy the Firefly DVD set...and maybe your support will help get another movie made. As Mr. Universe says, \\"you can't stop the signal.\\"
B0001KZM3O|3.0|As a huge fan of Pink Floyd, I was expecting an awesome CD. I enjoy listening to the CD but some songs are just blah so skip past them. Im not sure if I had the chance that I would purchase it. But to each his own.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|This album is great, lots of drumming and variety - as always with Paul Simon, great music!
B00005JOFO|5.0|this movie is unbelievable,  ihave never seen a better movie in my entire life. there is so much passion in this movie it really touched your heart. if you watch this movie and all youget out of it is 2 guys having sex then you need to watch closer and appreciate the message and the passion that movie is portraying, i give the writer props fro writing such an amazing movie!!! so guys swallow your pride and dont miss out on this amazing movie!!
B0002IVN9W|1.0|Very dissonant music, the lead vocalist can't carry a tune, totally overhyped.  Good thing I can take this back to the record store and get at least partial credit for my mistake.  This is the future of music???  Help!
B00005JOFO|2.0|I just saw this film for the second time. All I have to say is that you must have patience and an open mind to understand the story and the struggle between these two gay characters, in love with each other - torn apart by their seperate lives.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The cinemetography was great and acting dynamite. But that was it!<br /><br />The disregard Ennis and Jack show to their families is awful AND unfair. I felt more sorry for the wives (especially Ennis's) than the 2 male sheep herders.  ***NOT cowboys***<br /><br />I gave it only 2 stars, after seeing it a second time. Questions at the end still remained unanswered. I guess that's the mystery. Nonetheless, it wasn't good at all.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|No doubt, Bruce Springsteen is one of the great rock legends of all time and one of our greatest songwriters and performers. While some might argue that his best work came after The River, I believe his best work is right here.<br /><br />The music is fresh, the production minimal, the emotion raw and real and the music almost spiritual. It is a listening sensation rarely found in today's music because it is truly an \\"album.\\" Track 1 was there for a reason as was Track 3. \\"Born to Run\\" is the the telling of a story -- if not linear, than emotional.<br /><br />And that would be enough, but the additional DVDs take the experience to a completely different level. Seeing Bruce in that form in that environment is almost too personal. It is a rare opportunity -- and treat -- to watch an artist become a star by the force of his own will and the genious of his creations, not by some overhyped media and marketing team.<br /><br />It is something I will share with my son when he is old enough, not unlike my Dad sharing Sinatra with me. There are artists that are transcendent and Bruce Springsteen is one of them. If you like Bruce or Rock n Roll this is a must have -- more so than anything else in the Bruce Springsteen catalog.
0670033375|1.0|I suggest a reader start with the conclusions Dr. Diamond recommends and then decide for yourself the value of his work.  Basically, he judges all human progress meaningless because it has brought us to the brink of his perceived global disaster.   <br />The doctor's remedy is for me, and you, to live in penury so the environment is not negatively impacted.  I just wonder what he is going to do with that money he hopes to earn from his book?  A fat retirement?  A new home?  God forbid, a new car?  I guess making a good profit from one's labor is fine if you are saving the world, but detriment to the environment if you are in another profession.  I would also like to know what thought Dr. Diamond gave to the environment regarding the small forest of trees cut down and the vats of poisonous ink poured to print his opus.  Not to mention the gallons of gasoline burned by trucks delivering it to the big box bookstores that are a blight on the natural environment.  Any book is junk when the author calls for the abolition of systems and institutions that pay him.  Dr. Diamond's elitist hypocrisy, \\"do as I say, not as I do\\", is clearly that, without a fig leaf of modesty.

0393327655|2.0|I just read this book my husband picked-up and finally had enough time to devote to a book I particularly didn't want to read in the first place.  It was more at the urging of my husband who wanted my view, because you see, I'm an ex-atheists.  Matter of fact, after reading this book, I decided to see my husband's review and I stumbled upon \\"Bill's\\" review and thought I must say a couple of things. <br /> <br />First, I did step away from what I was carefully taught (Bill).  See, I was raised to be an atheists.  It was 12 years ago, in my mid-thirties and I became a Christian by looking at all the evidence: Logical, historical, existential, and practicle (two year journey). My conversion is because of my ability to reason, the very same tools I learned as an atheist.  Born and raised in Europe, I was inculcated with atheism, in a cultural setting that frowned upon religious people. <br /> <br />Hence, the second problem:  Mr. Harris' \\"future of reason\\" is a vision he suggests by ending religion.  He asserts that religious people want to curtail the \\"private freedoms\\" of others; but he disregards the many instances where secular political philosophers attempt, or wish to attempt to do the same thing to religious people.  Further, he states that many of these private vices harm no one (he does not provide much of an arguemnet, but mostly states it as fact).  In the contemporary Western Christian tradition, this is extremely rare, nore is it always the case that it is religious people who dare to curb society's hunger.  In addition, he gives the impression that there is a large scale prosecution of people who engage in such pleasurable acts, but gives no statistics of such widespread arrests. <br /> <br />He continues into marijuana, equating it with alcohol, but makes a categorical mistake, something a person with a degree in philosophy should never do (ex: one can drink without intoxication, one only smokes \\"dope\\" to become intoxicated).  Further, take William F. Buckley, a conservative Christian who has long argued for the legalization of Mary Jane. He is not the only one, many Christians believe it should be legal.  He makes sweaping judgements on religion execpt certain Eastern ones, because they seem to fit is falsely applied scientism. <br /> <br />I could go on, but the book is filled with so many problems; however, I must admit he is a clever author with a hint of humorous sarcasm, which I find entertaining.  I do suggests he get his tutition back from Standford, his work as a pilosopher, at least the work presented in this book, is poor indeed.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|Maybe it gets better after the first half hour.  I don't know.  That's all I could stand.
B000002MUW|4.0|To be honest, this is actually my least favorite 90's album of hers, but that doesn't mean it's not still great. I think alot of fans needed an overall softer sound after \\"Erotica\\". Looking back, it seems like the hit \\"Take A Bow\\" was more popular than the album as a whole. However this also gave us the hits \\"Secret\\" and \\"Human Nature\\". I tend to like other songs even more than those though, like \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\", and the Bjork-written \\"Bedtime Stories\\". While most of the disc is very warm and ballad-heavy, a song like the title track shows where she was headed on the next album \\"Ray Of Light\\". Overall this album is a must for the major fan, but casual fans should be able to get by with \\"GHV2\\" over this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a great series. I was really disappointed when it was removed from the air. This box set has the entire series plus 3 episodes that never aired on Fox (they did air when the series was rebroadcast on SciFi). The only thing missing from this box set is the musical score.
B00005JO1P|5.0|This movie is phenomenal.  It is a truly beautiful love story and the performances by Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix are inspiring and wonderful.  It is a special tribute to a dynamic pair of true soulmates.
B000669GAI|5.0|This 2-Disc best of compilation of the great band comes wonderfully packaged in gatefold cardboard sleeve which unfolds into 3 square pieces.  It also contains a 16-page booklet that contains pictures of the band as well as the credits page.  The tracks are also thoughtfully arranged so that all the harder, faster paced tracks are on the \\"Up\\" side (Disc One)and the slower paced ones are on the \\"Down\\" side (Disc Two).  Most importantly though, the sound quality is very, very good due in no small part to the great remixing done by Brendan O'Brien on \\"Once\\" and \\"Alive\\".  Let's hope they do a similar job on \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs\\" and rerelease them in mini-lp sleeve replica designs too!  I've always thought that the sound quality on these two and especially on \\"Ten\\" was not as good as it could be.  Great track selections, great sound quality, great album design and packaging all make this the best (and currently the only) compilation album of Pearl Jam that's out there.  Great for those of you who want to sample or learn more about the band but don't want to get all the albums.  Recommended.
0380789035|5.0|\\"American Gods\\" was the first novel i'd ever read by Gaiman, and i was indeed impressed. i've recommended it to two of my friends already, and plan on passing it along to many more. The novel is filled with scenes that make you think beyond the book, and Gaiman's quirky sense of humor pervades it all. i won't spoil it for you, but believe me, the ending is worth the entire book. Don't miss this read.

It has all the rage from Undertow without sounding too over-the-top and is has the right amount of \\"artiness\\" without sounding like it's trying too hard to be smart.  Hopefully the new album coming in 2006 will not be at all like Lateralus.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you're a fan of the Firefly show upon which this film is based or not, you will enjoy this movie. It is action-packed and humorous, without being silly and trite. The characters are interesting and the new un-polished view of the space travel of our future is refreshing. It's what we love about the old Star Wars films, wihtout copying their formula. There's no pretentious Jedi or awful Hayden Christiansen acting. The main characters, specifically Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) are quite likeable, even without the backstory. In fact, what I liked best about the film (and the series) are the characters. They are some of the most relatable characters out there. Despite the futuristic setting, the struggles and relationshps the characters have are easy to follow. You'll love it if you love good movies. If you like crappy movies, may I suggest something from the Lindsey Lohan collection?
0307276902|5.0|i know that it's shocking and upseting that a writer would fabricate a story and call it nonfiction, but, honestly, why don't you go examine all creative non-fiction books, and see if they're all 100% true. james frey is a writer, and he wrote a good story, give him credit for it. i understand that he lied, and it was wrong, but he wrote an intriguing story, that most of you enjoyed reading. <br /> <br />and if you think that every thing you read is always true, you're just being ignorant.
B000005RS0|5.0|Private Dancer is one of the great rock/pop albums of all time. Tina, of course, being one of the greatest artists of all time. The original album consisting of the first 10 songs heard here, was brilliant. It launched Tina's comeback with hits like What's Love Got To Do With It, Better Be Good To Me, Let's Stay Together, Private Dancer, Help and I Can't Stand The Rain.  <br />This remastered copy, also includes four songs that weren't released on CD before. I Wrote A Letter, Rock 'n' Roll Widow, Don't Rush The Good Things, and When I Was Young were all B-sides to the albums singles. It also features extended versions of three of the albums centerpiece singles.  <br /> <br />This edition is for the most part for the avid Tina Turner collector, not so much the casual fan. But for the Tina buff, its fantastic. Quite the collectors item. I personally love it.
B000002U8G|5.0|One of Floyd's best. One of These Days and Echoes are two of Floyd's best tracks. If you haven't given this recording a listen, you aren't a through-and-through Floyd fan. Buy it!
0307276902|1.0|Well, the book was entertaining. Since I purchased the bood just prior to Mr. Frey being outed by the smoking gun. And finished it just before Oprah's revenge on Mr. Frey. <br />The book itself if it were true would have been Pulitzer Prize worthy.  <br />Now, it's just another fictional book.
0307276902|1.0|If you people think this book is a great piece of literature, then you really have a problem. The prose is amateurish, with lack of editing, run-on sentences, the atrocious grammar,it's a train-wreck. What is all this non-sense? It's quite obvious that some reviewers don't have a clue: <br /> <br />1. The publisher knew about the book, and even said that as a fiction it didn't have enough characters, Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Then they decided to pass it on as a memoir, hoping that they wouldn't get caught.  <br />2. Fiction or Non- the book is plain rubbish! <br />3. So- now the book is what? Fiction? Please! <br />4. So- now we have Eddie Haskell, telling us he lied! <br />5. Lied, or not, memoir or fiction, his writing career is finished, he has no credibility. <br />6. He'll be remembered as a disgraced author,that lied, not a great writer.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|I don't really like sci-fi movies but this is the one exception. Any movie with people stranded on a planet relying on an escaped convict to save them to me sounds like one of the coolest plots ever. The role of Richard Riddick was tailor made for Vin Diesel. He kicks ass, takes names, and shows everyone who's boss. The other standout performance in this movie was Cole Hauser as Johns. Even though he was a jerk, he was great at tricking the other people into thinking he was a good guy. But I wouldn't even have considered this movie if Vin Diesel wasn't in it. He carries the film from start to finish. With awesome action, great special effects, and a menacing hero, this is a film you don't want to pass up. A Diesel-powered film for all fans!
B000B5XOSO|5.0|The look of this movie almost gives me an orgasm. lol It's darker, gothic. (Even the day scenese, because of the winter atmostphere, are mostly inb blue.)  The sleaker look of the Batsuit, new tricks from the Batmobile (love the turning around bit)and killer clowns and pissed off secretaries. :D It takes everything that was good about the original and takes it to another height. <br /> <br />I wasn't too thrilled about the Christopher Walken character. But, everything I mentioned before makes up for that. :)
B00003CXWV|5.0|Of all the movies that I've seen Johnny Depp in, this by far is his best work to date. He portrays George Jung so perfectly. He should have gotten Oscar consideration for this part. You also have excellent performances from other actors such as Jordi Molla, Ray Liotta, and Penelope Cruz. Blow is the pursuit of The American Dream gone terribly wrong. It's so well made yet very depressing. This is a very powerful motion picture with strong performances all-around. A must buy for your movie collection!
B000B5XOXY|4.0|Flash back to 1995. There was an outcry for a return to the fun-filled Batman days that many new from the 60's series(Adam West). Some people (not me) felt that Batman Returns was too dark. So this was suppose to be a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />Yes, the suit had nipples. That wasn't a thing I enjoyed myself. But, the Batmobile featured in that one is my hands down favorite. Jim Carrey as the Riddler stands right up there next to Jack Nicholson's Joker as one of the best comic book movie villians ever.  <br /> <br />The movie WAS a hit. The soundtrack WAS a hit...These people who want to claim to have never liked it are full of bunk! If I seem to recall correctly it did just as much business, if not a lil more than Burton's films. A lot of people (Batman fans) were obviously watching.
1583762027|5.0|While not a revolutionary masterpiece from Tracy, it's complete and direct.  This book focuses on getting things done, avoiding time wasting, and getting the biggest/most important job done first.  I try to read, listen, and watch everything from B.T..  It's a shame he wasn't elected governor of California.  He's a man who walks the walk.  In fact, I began my love of self-improvement/motivational material after listening to one of his older tape sets.  While I still have a long way to go, I have also come a long way.  It would be cool if Tracy read this review!    Keep eating those frogs!
B000BUYP4Q|1.0|Don't get me wrong. I like Batman Begins. I bought it the other day too. But, Tim Burton's Batman movies are the BEST!! Bar none. The most entertaining and the most visually appealing. (Begins is a little too grainy.) <br /> <br />The so called-Batman purists dislike the original because Jack Napier/Joker kills Bruce Wayne's parents. Big deal. \\"It's not true to the comics\\" is the lame, blindly followed line. Well if that's the case then why in the hell is Ras Al Guhl not in the desert and there's no mention of the Lazerus Pit?? \\"Batman doesn't kill\\". What happened in Begins? Someone died. Why no black and blue suit? <br /> <br />It's an interesting and refreshing thing to see the origin of the bat suit, equipment etc. But, at times the suit looks to thick.  One of the many things that made Batman appealing was his intellect. The mystery of if he designed his own stuff. His detective skills, deciphering Riddles etc. He doesn't really need a Lucious Fox. I couldn't help but miss the yellow emblem. (Hopefully,Nolan and Goyer bring it back.) <br /> <br />If you are a first time viewer you will like this movie. As a film to over and over..It's good once you get past a couple of drawn out beginning scenes. For a return to anything Batman I give it a 4. :)
B00001OH7P|5.0|This has some of my fave songs: Ziggy Stardust, Five Years, Moonage Daydream, Lady Stardust.... A good snapshot of Bowie in his prime!

I can see it the whole way through without having to pause or jump scenes (as I do with the first 30 minutes of Nolan). Jack Nicholson didn't STEAL the film. The praise he gets is well-deserved from flatout kickass acting. Keaton holds is own too. I love the Batmobile here. This one and the one from Forever are great. (Forever being my favorite one). :)
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Because the strokes got so much hype over their first album 'Is This It?' there was a lot of expectations from their fans and critics. Many bands would be afraid of the follow up album and they probably were, but when room on fire came out, some strokes fans didn't even buy it because of some awful reviews. But honestly, a lot of other bands wouldn't have been able to put together such a good album in the same time that the strokes took to do room on fire. 'Reptilia' is probably one of the best songs i have evr heard and the popier songs like 'I can't Win' and 'Meet Me In The Bathroom' are short and catchy, and no doubt incredibly good. Two of the singles '12:51' and 'The End Has No End' are both really good. But like on every album theres a few tracks which you listen to, enjoy but are pretty much forgettable, but it is obvious that the strokes made an awsome effort for something they only had a few months on and 'First Impressions Of Earth' is really one of the best recent albums around. The Strokes wouldn't be were they are today if they hadn't had the misfortune that they had with 'Room On Fire' but it still is a really, really, really ace album. BUY IT NOW!!!

B0000DJZB9|3.0|Seeing the old videos for Gn'R was cool but it needed more. Some live cuts, interviews about the videos, something. I guess for the price it's worth it. Would like to see an official release of Live at the Ritz in 88'. I don't know if it's up to them or Mtv but that was a great show.
1400031087|5.0|You guys are idiots, if you could not read the book and tell that many things were embellished.  I finished the book about a week before all the controversy hit, and the morning after I finished it, I told my wife that James Fry had embellished portions of the book.  Even with the embellishments, it does not change the message of the book, which was to GET THE HELL off of CRACK and stop using dope.  If you can not see that then you are truly sad.  I think this is a great book, and I don't even like to read.  He has a strong message that people needs to take head of.
B000267JQK|5.0|Here we go, finally an album that is put together for the audience's enjoyment. This might be a remake with a few additions of songs, but for someone who didn't buy the first release, this is an incredible value. No CD has 20 tracks on it anymore, none. This stands alone as an hour long music experience with maybe 2 or 3 songs out of twenty that you will want to skip past. The sond is awesome, well put together, and pulse pounding and emotional.. varying from hard to soft and back again, it's a long rollercoaster of emotions from track to track, ending with the smash hit broken with amy lee to finish the album, leaving everyone wanting more. There is nothing greater than buying an album for it's hits and finding songs on the album you like far more than the songs you already knew, this album delivers on that and more. This is far better than the followup album, and far better than most albums i've ever bought. You cannot go wrong buying this cd if you are a true rock fan, there isn't anything better out there. Trust me.
B000002UAR|5.0|This Beatles album gives you an idea of how the Beatles began evolving. Excellent!
B0007CNXUK|5.0|My five year old son loves the story of Peter Pan.  Seeing this movie depicting the creation of the play \\"Peter Pan\\" and putting the Pan story into a real world context opened his eyes into the power of imagination.  Outstanding cast, great story line, A WINNER!
B000002LBH|5.0|What else can I say about this band except they were great, with the wordplay and fantastic instrumental usage as well...Listening to alot of great stuff from around that time and beyond, they are definately up there on the list...From \\"Is it really so strange\\" to \\"Asleep\\", even enjoy that gem \\"Golden Lights\\", little different from the rest of these classics...The Smiths...Great!Great!Great!Indeed
B00000K31Q|4.0|Having watched this movie way too many times, I admit I have discovered some absurd plot defects in it (for example, like the fact that Patrick Verona is portrayed at the beginning as having no idea who Kat Stratford is, even though they are in the same English class in which Kat apparently sounds off every day...).  But the fact remains, this movie is just irresistable.  It's one of the few \\"teen movies\\" that seems to remain totally watchable over and over again.  The performances are all terrific, down to even  the smaller roles (Daryl \\"Chill\\" Mitchell as Mr. Morgan the take-no-prisoners English teacher and Allison Janney as Ms. Perky, the brutally efficient romance-novel-writing guidance counselor).  While there's a certain amount of stereotyping going on amid the \\"geeks\\" and the \\"cool kids\\", both types are portrayed with more humor and complexity than usual.  The story's take on Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew is, like other reviewers have indicated, a good balance between faithfulness and fun.  Also, the music soundtrack (featuring a number of songs by Letters By Cleo) seems to be aging quite well (always a hazard in a movie of this sort).  But let's face it:  The movie is worth watching, simply to see Heath Ledger lip-sync the song \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off of You\\" in front of the girls' soccer squad.  Can't take my eyes off of you?? I can't take my eyes off of him!
1932907009|5.0|I actually found this book looking for how to write better novels. I think screenwriters have to work harder to communicate their stories in fewer pages and have to jump through more hoops to get their writing sold than most novelists. Blake Snyder's \\"Save the Cat\\" delivered beyond my wildest imagination. <br /> <br />If you're even thinking about writing a screenplay, you should buy this book just for the discussions on the Blake Snyder Beat Sheet and how to put up your story on \\"The Board.\\" These two ideas alone are worth the price of the book. The importance of being clear on what your story is about so people immediately \\"get it\\" was exactly what I was looking for to keep me on track. His discussion on how to pace your story and why, complete with examples from contemporary movies, was what actually got me to buy the book.  <br /> <br />I was also surprised with an important bonus for existing screenwriters that frankly should have been featured on the cover (probably will be in the next reprint -- you heard it here first). If you have an existing screenplay that you know just doesn't work for some reason, Blake has a valuable list of techniques on how to troubleshoot your problems. Again, worth the price of the book if you're in this situation. <br /> <br />If you want an honest and practical how-to-do-it from someone who has been doing it very successfully for awhile, if you only want to read one book to get you started right, if you've written lots of screenplays and wonder why some of them didn't get bought or how to fix them so they are, you owe it to yourself to buy and read this book.
0553801503|2.0|The Good <br />The grit of the setting and GRRMs writing style is entertaining <br /> <br />The Bad <br />The series itself is on a rollercoaster Book 1 simply superb, book 2 slow a little boring but setting things up, book 3 one of the best books ever once things where set in motion they just wouldn't stop.  Book 4 disappointing, bad way to split it and slow which will likely set up book 5 to be good.  So he can end the series with a bang I hope the series goes to eight books. <br /> <br /> <br />The Ugly <br />The Cover, how did this go so wrong.   Don't Judge a book by its cover...worst cover...worst book ...hmmm. <br /> <br />Splitting the book, ok he gambled and IMO it failed hard core, he would have been way better off to release a 2500 page monster (and charge much more or release two books Feast I and Feast II simultaneously). <br /> <br />The audio tapes, why did they get another reader? <br />
B00006LLNU|5.0|This album is a great mix of instrumental and non-instrumental tracks. It is remarkably dreary for how pretty it is, and becomes something of a mystery as you try to figure out what its about. The musical aspect of it is very ambient, but not boring, each song seems to build and even get intense. The mystery may belong to fact that the lyrics are sung in a made up \\"Hopelandic\\" language, which sounds alot like Icelandic to me. This album is completely, in every sense of the word beauty, everything seems pleasant, and the singer Jonsi Birgisson sounds like a female throughout most of the album, but as you can imagine, he can hit some incredible notes. This is the kind of music that i listen to, and have trouble understanding how it all goes together so smoothly, to the point where their is nothing i can imagine that could be added, because it is that perfect. <br />Favorite instrumental track- Track 3 <br />Favorite track with vocals- Track 4 <br />(the whole album is untitled)
B000BW7QWW|5.0|whether or not you've seen FireFly, which you should have(if not buy the series and watch it now), this movie is worth seeing and is a spectacular yet overlooked film.  Great movie to add to any collection.  Great dialogue and characters.  Have fun with it.
B000001ZS4|5.0|I can still remember the first time I heard this album - I was simply blown away! I guess I was about 13 years old, and an older dude in my class listened to Jarre on his walkman. You could hear the bleeps and bloops oozing from his headphone from miles away!<br /><br />I bought the album on vinyl and listened to it until the needle had to be replaced. And once I got the album on CD years later, I was amazed how clear the sound was...<br /><br />This was the album that introduced me to Jarre's music, and that has been my favorite Jarre-album ever since. Most people like Oxygene best, but I like this one. I like listening to it in a completely dark room, with headphones on. I imagine that I'm somewhere in a kind of magical place, witnessing the sunrise. I can't help it, the music is capturing. And I always feel sad when the last song on the album starts...<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with Jarre's music, start with this record, or with Oxygene - and then move on through Jarre's other albums, like a journey through the musical universe of Jean Michel Jarre.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|excellent show, shouldn't have been cancelled, everyone needs to see it.  enough said.
B000001ZS3|5.0|This album was Jarre's breakthrough album. Who doesn't know the tune from Oxygene IV? Nowadays we forget how much effort was put into this album, without the aid of MIDI or computerized samples. Just listen to the wind and bird-sounds - all produced using the white and pink noise from synthesizers. Jarre is one of the pioneers of synth music, and this album definitely proves it.<br /><br />The album is still a classic and although it is already 30 years old (2006 is the thirtiest anniversary!), it sounds like it was recorded yesterday. The music is a mix of rythmic elements and lush pads, string-like sounds, winds, and alien bleeps and blurps. But most of all, this album is all about melody - melodies you will be unable to forget once you have heard them.<br /><br />If you like this album, you should definitely check out Oxygence 7-13. On that album, published a few years ago, Jarre revisits the sounds and synths used on the first Oxygene album, but with todays' technologies. You will find that even with the new technologies, the original Oxygene still stands firmly, and will remain so for decades to come.
1400031087|5.0|I have read this book and it is easily one of the best books on crack addiction and recovery I have ever read. I couldn't care less whether it is 1% fictional or 100% fictional: it is an absolutely great story worthy of a movie. On top of that this is a book that will be a great inspiration to those in need. I have been also following the controversy surrounding the author and also Oprah's shameless about face which,let's face it ,has nothing to do with the \\"truth\\". A great book-highly recommended.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This is the film that in my opinion displaced the 1931 Universal version as the best ever.Hammers rendition of Dracula is perfect. Chris Lee was far better than Lagosi in the role of the bloodsucking count.The visual scenery was stuning at the time this film was made (at a low to moderate budget).When I seen this film as a  young lad in 1959 it scared the crap out of me. Although Hammers ground breaking \\"heaving breasts\\" displayed by the Vamp trying to get a drink from Johnathan Harkers throat was intersting to say the least.The classic chase of Dracula by Van Helsing to his lair in the end was unforgetable to me to this day almost 50 years later.A hell of a ending to say the least. Hammer studio well deserves the reputation for producing the best horror films in the late 50's-70's era. Their films were classics indeed.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna is known for re-inventing herself with every new album. It's one of the reasons why she has had such a successful and flourishing musical career. Of course, it was only a matter of time before one of her re-inventions wouldn't connect with the public, thus where \\"American Life\\" steps in. The first single and title track stalled on the charts, peaking at #37, and becoming the first  album of her career to not have a top ten hit (sans \\"Die Another Day, included here, which peaked at #8, but was released several months before). It probably didn't help that Madonna threw away the original video for \\"American Life\\" and made instead, a weak video that caught no one's eye. The album itself debuted at #1, but quickly fell out of sight, becoming her lowest selling studio album of her career. Though certified platinum, \\"American Life\\" only sold about 650,000. A huge drop from the 2.9 million her previus album, \\"Music,\\" had sold.  <br /> <br />But at that stage in Madonna's career, chart places and album sales were irrelevent. The question is: Is the music here really as bad as the critics made it out to be? Well, It really depends on how you look at it. If this album had been released by an inferior artist, the reaction towards it probably would have been different. But, this is Madonna's album, not someone elses, and if you go by the standerds that she has set up for herself with her previous albums, then \\"American Life\\" definitely seems like one of her weakest efforts.  <br /> <br />The problem, in part, in the lyrics. The first single was fine until she starts to rap. Though, she's not bad at all, the lyrics she's rapping are next to awful, which does bring the song down. Other songs fall to the same problem, including \\"I'm So Stupid\\" and \\"Mother And Father.\\" Though both are obviously more personal then other songs on the album, their lyrical weakness almost brings them down. But, every Madonna album had it's high points, no matter how weak it may be, and \\"AmericanLife\\" is no exception. While the best song is arguably \\"Die Another Day,\\" which was released for the movie of the same name the year before, \\"Nothing Fails\\" and \\"X-Static Process\\" are the high points of the new material. The former almost sounds like \\"Like A Prayer, Pt. 2,\\" stating that she loves someone so much, it makes her want to pray he'll always be there. The latter is a subtle, but powerful, acoustic sounding track in which Madonna states that she's never her true self.  <br /> <br />Though, none of the material is trully awful, \\"American Life\\" is brought down by songs such as \\"Easy Ride\\" and \\"Nobody Knows Me.\\" Niether are really bad, but as far as Madonna goes, they just don't stand out, and really don't catch your ear, or attention, in any way. But, this is Madonna we're talking about, and she will never stay down for long, as she proved with 2005's fantastic \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor.\\" But even so, while \\"American Life\\" doesn't have much in the way of dance music, these are her true confessions, as weak as they may sometimes be.
B000301YY8|1.0|James Blunt song \\"Beautiful\\" is the worst song I think I have ever heard in my life. It is worse than \\"Fish-heads\\" (at least that song was amusing). He has no talent. Simple songwriting has produced some of the best pop/rock songs ever, but simple and low quality just equals bad. I actually find this CD insulting. Record companies wonder why no one buys CD's anymore, it is because of \\"singer-songwriters\\" like James Blunt. <br /> <br />\\"You're beautiful. You're beautiful. <br />You're beautiful, it's true. <br />There must be an angel with a smile on her face, <br />When she thought up that I should be with you. <br />But it's time to face the truth, <br />I will never be with you.\\" <br /> <br />I bet there are over a million 13 year old girls in this country who could write better lyrics than that...
B00005JNX0|5.0|This movie is hilarious!!! Full of grown up jokes but also funny for kids and with a lot of references to other movies is the best combination of humor and message I've seen.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|As critics, we sometimes will view a fantasy film such as King Kong with our highly critical minds and become lost in the endless sea of \\"It's too long...it's too bloated...it's too over-the-top...it's too this...it's too that...\\" and on and on and on. I'm not saying such criticisms are invalid, but sometimes we forget about the entire reason movies were invented in the first place: entertainment. Sometimes we just need to sit back and enjoy the ride, and King Kong is one hell of a roller coaster. <br /> <br />The original 1933 classic was the grandest, purest, and most exciting action adventure film ever made at its time, and in my opinion, it remains so today. It was a beautiful, sprawling epic with a heart of gold. However, in 1976, a Hollywood remake came along and replaced the timeless themes of adventure and tragedy with an ill-placed social commentary on greed and politics. There's nothing wrong with a good social commentary, but the fragile tale of King Kong is a highly inappropriate vehicle. So what makes Peter Jackson's 2005 remake any different than your average Hollywood cash-in? The answer is simple: passion. Peter Jackson readily admits that King Kong is the project he has waited his entire life to undertake. As a child, the original was what inspired him to become a filmmaker. He has explained that he remade Kong because he felt indebted to it, and his way of repaying it is by bringing the magic of Kong back into cinemas for a new generation. Jackson's earnest enthusiasm is extremely apparent in every frame of the resulting film. <br /> <br />As the film begins, the first aspect that stood out to me was the gorgeously recreated 1930s Manhattan. There truly was a lot of care put into every detail. As the film progressed, the next element that struck me was the characters. I have heard people complain that they thought the acting was terrible and the characters were irritating. I simply do not understand this, and have to wonder if these people woke upon the wrong side of the bed. I found the entire cast to be terrific, especially the three leads: Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody. Watts delivers one of the absolute best performances in recent memory, conveying some truly heartbreaking emotions through her eyes alone. Black continues the string of comedic actors transitioning to more serious roles that began with Jim Carrey in The Truman Show (and more recently Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and continued with Adam Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love. Though I wouldn't quite put Black at the level of those two knockout crossovers yet, I still think he did one hell of a great job. <br /> <br />Jackson crafts a wonderful atmosphere for the film right from the start, and even throws in loads of in-jokes and homages for film-lovers to catch, referencing everything from the original Kong to Jackson's deliciously infamous early work. I know I never expected to see a King Kong remake that references Dead-Alive! <br /> <br />But once the characters arrive on Skull Island, the film really begins to impress. What Jackson delivers is the most gigantic, overwhelming feast of special effects ever committed to celluloid. I am not saying they are the most revolutionary or impressive effects in history by any means, but I sure was exhausted by the enormous scale of it all - something no other film has made me feel. Once the action begins, it quickly becomes a relentless onslaught of cinematic grandeur. I have noticed many people complaining that this hour(ish)-long sequence is overkill. To me, that seems like the entire point. Of course it's overkill! It's meant to be - this is, after all, an island full of vicious prehistoric beasts. <br /> <br />And Jackson simply nails every aspect of this sequence perfectly. He doesn't concern himself with practical reality, something I feel too many fantasy films attempt to do. This is fantasy - it's not supposed to be real, so why try to make it? Jackson gives us impeccably over-the-top fantasy action, and I have never seen it done so well. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, by the time Kong is captured and everyone arrives back in Manhattan, I couldn't help but feel a little burned out. After a sequence as awe-inspiring as the preceding Skull Island, it's hard not to be let down a little bit by the final act. However, I can't help but wonder if Jackson intended this. The film's first hour carries an aura of enthusiastic anticipation, the second hour is fantastic, all-out action, and now the third hour seems to bear a sad, somber tone. Perhaps being underwhelmed was the intended effect? <br /> <br />In short: I was captivated by this film. Is it without flaws? Of course not. Is it occasionally corny? Sure. Does it have some unnecessary subplots? Yes. Is it over-the-top? Of course. But these things are minor in my opinion, and I, for one, had no problem just sitting back and soaking in the majesty of it all.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is a great CD.  If you are looking for another Darkside of the Moon you may not like this one though.  It was made in the 60's and it really shows in the sound.  It's a little weird and silly rather than intensely psychodelic like the later stuff.  This is a must have for people who are into the Abby Road style of psychodelic 60's stuff.
B0000025F7|5.0|Music you can't help but love. \\"Off the Wall\\" is a perfect example of why Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones are legends in music. Before their revolution with \\"Thriller\\", they cut this solid R&B/disco album, an album that still sounds fresh today and can set fire to any dance floor. From driving, hypnotic dance epics to lush, tender ballads, \\"Off the Wall\\" features amazing vocals from Jackson, on-point production from Q, and an array of some of the best session musicians to grace a studio: Greg Phillinganes, Paulinho DaCosta, John Robinson, the list goes on. Get on the floor.
B000001DYA|5.0|This album is a MUST HAVE !!! ...One of THEE greatest Power Trio's to ever come along , Blue Cheer just lays down an umcompromising sonic assault of solid fuzz drenched , feedback distorted , psychedelic power chords ......I get a big ' Spinal Tap ' smile on my face everytime this hits the turntable...........grabs me by the short and curlies , the way that the early 'Stooges' albums do.....Rock N' Roll in all it's stripped down glory....loud , intense  , three chords , and a LOTTA FUN !!!!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|\\"Thriller\\" is a one-of-a-kind. Maybe that's why it's the best-selling album worldwide. Not before or since has something like this been made. You start off with the driving dance funk of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", move into the R&B/Soul of \\"Baby Be Mine\\", get a little smooth pop with former Beatle McCartney battling it out with Jackson, and you get a taste of the undead with the classic funk of \\"Thriller\\". Something different in the first four cuts. Then you flipped the record over and you had a little rock-and-roll that you can dance to with \\"Beat It\\", you were slipped away into dream land with \\"Human Nature\\", did a little leg-twitching with the bouncy R&B of \\"PYT\\", and romanced your girl with \\"The Lady in My Life\\". And all in between, you heard a hypnotizing, unique cut called \\"Billie Jean\\", which has become one of the best songs in the history of music. Michael Jackson broke the boundaries and thrilled the whole world with \\"Thriller\\". Overrated? No way. It's really that good.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Don't listen to the idiot professional critic Peter Blackstock who downgrades this 52nd Street cd. This is even better than it's predecessor The Stranger, and a lot better than Glass Houses also. This is the first Billy Joel album that I listened to all the way through (my sister had a copy of this on vinyl). I might regard this so highly because it was the first Joel album I ever heard, but really this is just a brilliant album, and I know several other people who regard this just as highly also. I would also like to let you know that the remasters of 52nd Street don't improve the sound at all, and I would really say that the sound is noticeably worse than the first issue from back in 1983. This is in the top 10 or 15 of the most played albums that I've ever owned, so I really know the sound quality of the first issue, and when you know the album like the back of your hand, you can tell that the remasters are worse in quality, so you Amazon customers, look under the different entries of 52nd Street and look for a seller that says that they have the original issue because I promise you that it's better.<br />Every track is a 10 on a scale of 1-10, so disregard what Peter Blackstock (or whatever the dumbass critics name is who gives a short review right under the song list above my review) has to say, because I doubt that he's a fan of Mr. Joel or really knows anything about him either. My favorite songs on 52nd Street are \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\", \\"Zanzibar\\", \\"Stilleto\\", \\"Half a Mile Away\\", \\"Until the Night\\", and \\"Honesty\\". Billy's at the top of his game with this superb offering, and if you liked The Stranger, I'm sure you will fall in love with 52nd Street. ENJOY!!!

0393327655|2.0|This will easily excite those already convinced of the danger and irrationality of any religion.  But preconceived notions are what Harris is about as well.  It must have sufficient evidence.  Here in wide ranging topical survey jumping from field to field, with in this reviewer's opinion little coherance, Harris seeks to prove extreme danger and need to eradicate \\"any\\" faith religion.  Interesting in final words he wants to leave in due to his own experience with forms of consciousness probing, even ethically arguing for drug usage without restriction and any control.<br /><br />Harris is all over the place -- philosophy, history, neuroscience, theology.  What must be said at this review's outset is that he does a limited job of tying all of this together.<br /><br />What this reviewer finds most lacking is his criticism of \\"all\\" religions as being irrational because of lack of sufficient evidence.  Here he does not attack at all the premise that so many Christians place their faith:  sufficient historical evidence both in history and time, then stored in historical documents, what Harris has tendency to call antiquated moronic tomes.  He challenges these historical events by not challenging their historical accuracy or occurance at all, but simply by equating previous centuries not having molecular biology or neuroscience as he studies or microwaves et al with then the deduction that using their religion \\"has to\\" be as lacking as their scientific decisions.  This is unfair move.<br /><br />I would love to see Harris (if he's man enough to debate a suitable Christian apologist [not one of political, media flavor] but one who debates and defends faith from historical position.  This is major objection to this work.<br /><br />The two stars and not one rating is due to his fine logical challenge to pragmatism and relativisim, as well as his contention against Islam.  What he has to offer here is salient, that Islam is basically a predatory political machine, and there is no doubting this if one reads the Koran.  Allah wanted to originally be more friendly with People of the Book, but when they would not condescend to his barbarism, then he declared jihad on them as well.  Thus, conflicting passages.<br /><br />But to then lay this against all religions is totally unfair move.  Likewise to find some group or individual who chose name Christian who ever believed or lived by events which Harris can captialize and universalize to all Christians is unlogical and irrational.  Such a philosophy student should no better.  Like to see him defend this in a fair debate with a good Christian philosopher.  The extreme danger is that ridding the world of all religions for division they create will not truly solve all the world's ailments.  Sure some, but heart of it is not religion.  One world government which Harris suggests is the solution (which he quickly says will not happen) but we must try.<br /><br />His solution about brain research and understanding more about neurosciene of belief, unbelief, certainty is so similar to Phil Donahue book resulting from NBC special \\"The Human Animal.\\"  Donahue's gaze into life suggests if we could only figure out in the brain chemistry why people murder, etc., just change the brain chemistry and we've got all world's problems sovled.  Harris is in that same false train, although he does admit that he is concerned that not all of humanness is in the brain.  If not, where?  Thus, Eastern mysticism?<br /><br />The year after \\"Afterword\\" challenges those criticisms which Harris deems unfair by those who have not read him correctly.  Since one of these he mentions about atheists disappointment in his mentioning in last chapter his affinity for consciousness Eastern style does seem to be self-contradictory given what he has said previously, but likely just more of this talented young man's non-thought through whole of the universe yet.  Amazing that he ends with awe at entirety and complexity of universe,yet will not yield to any chance of Intelligent Designer?<br /><br />He challenges in his \\"Epilogue\\":  \\"What could possibly cause billions of human beings to reconsider their religious beliefs?\\"  For Christians, Harris et al will have to convincingly prove historically that Jesus and church's history is false.  This has been attempted by several intelligent people, and failed.  Also, the liberal Christians have been attempting this for years and haven't convinced many thoughtful types simply because their evidence presented thus far is lacking and imaginative.  Again, agree with Harris' on the unreasoableness of Islam's historical accuracies, which Islam will not truly enter into discussion.  Here see marvelous book on this: Answering Islam, by Geisler and Saleeb.<br /><br />Finally, Harris' representation of Christian's usage of Old Testament is severely warped.  Any beginning seminarian can refute his conclusions as not representing fairly what they have faith in.  To anyone with a fair and open mind, this indicates that Harris has not done his research into the matter thoroughly or carefully enough, or has some ethical dilemma with fairly presenting the case.<br /><br />Reading this book takes me back to Apologetics class where we had to review atheistic essays from their formidable tome: \\"Critiques of God: Making the Case Against God\\" by Peter Angeles, editor; entering into this with some trepidation that just possibly I would be swayed by their evidence or could not refute it on apologetic terms, I found to my amazement that their philosophical arguments were not truly that persuasive.<br /><br />So the same for Harris to those who hear all arguments.  If one keeps an open mind, at the very least one will come to the conclusion that equally intelligent and rational humans provide equally logical and unifying arguments in favor of faith based religion.  Witness this statement of philosopher Nagel which Harris quotes and admires his defense of rationality:  \\"I want atheism to be true and and am uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well-informed people I know are religious believers.  It isn't just that I don't believe in God and, naturally, hope that I'm right in my belief.  It's that I hope there in no God!  I don't want there to be a God; I don't want the universe to be like that.\\"signer?

B000002J1L|5.0|I love this Album/ CD! Everyone should listen to \\"The Musical Box\\" simply to hear the true genius of Genesis. \\"Nursery Crymes\\" is one of those recordings that grows on you. I remember feeling that way when I purchased the LP over 3 (!!!) decades ago. It just \\"clicked\\" with me. Every track (\\"...Hogweed\\", \\"Fountains...\\" especially) resonates with a feeling that the group was striving to be as creative as possible. I really admire that. Some people have difficulty getting into it because thay claim it \\"sounds too dated\\". I think anyone who appreciates Prog Rock must have this recording in their collection.

0553801503|3.0|George Martin has me spoiled for wonderful depth of characterization and detailed world-building: there's simply no one in the genre who does it better.  That continues here, in a very believable place that has a population of intriquing characters with real rooting value.  Its the sheer SIZE of that population that's becoming a problem!  <br />With such a long wait for this latest volume in the series, and with such a huge cast of characters milling around in such a convoluted plot, it's honestly almost impossible to remember and keep straight who is who, and why they're doing what they're doing! Take the time to re-read the previous volumes before you pick up this one, or I warn you you'll spend about a thousand pages just scratching your head.

0393312836|4.0|A Clockwork Orange is a science fiction novel that takes place in the near future. The main character, Alex, and his \\"droogs,\\" or friends, go out at night committing crimes.  Alex, who is fifteen, knows what he is doing and seems to be enjoying all the wrong doings he does.  Most of these acts include violence and rape.  Finally after beating and raping a woman police finally arrests Alex.  He is given a fourteen year sentence but after killing a cellmate Alex is chosen to be the first candidate for a new test called Ludovico's Technique.  This process basically makes Alex not want to commit violent acts.  In two years Alex cleans up his act and is released from prison.  Now although Alex is technically free person he is unable to do what he wants and basically doesn't have the power to make decisions anymore.  Alex then encounters the husband of a victim he had raped and beaten.  When this man learns it was Alex who did it to his wife he makes a plan to force Alex to suicide.  But will Alex give in? <br /> <br />       One of the most interesting and unique things that Anthony Burgess does in A Clockwork Orange is that he creates a whole slang vocabulary.  At first it can be frustrating on trying to figure out what some of these slang terms mean but after a while you are able to pick up on what these words mean.  A Clockwork Orange is often disturbing and really violent.  Those aspects of the novel made it hard for me to put down because it made it so interesting to read.  The thing that I disliked about this novel was that some parts were hard to read.  This caused me to go back and reread the same parts a couple times.  This mainly occurred in the beginning of the novel though. <br />
1881273156|5.0|One of the best books written.  I particularly recommend this book to be read together with husband and wife especially if they have unresolved problems.  It is a book you cannot put down and is very well written.  It goes very well with the book you recommend \\"Covenant Marriage.\\"  If one should follow what Gary Chapman has written in both of these books, it could very well put ones marriage back together.

I can't wait for the performance rights for theaters to be able to conduct this score and have it performed.... or even play in the pit.. THIS music is fantastic, mature, exciting, as well as the story line being amazing.  Even if you haven't seen the musical, you will still be able to follow the plot and events through the music/story.  Very invigorating and inspirational.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I found the movie Brokeback Mountain to be absolutely amazing and superbly acted.  Once I'd seen the film, I knew that I had to have the soundtrack.  The soundtrack is a beautiful reflection of the movie and its sad story of tragic love.  I believe the Santaolalla's music (Brokeback Mountain, Snow, Wings) is breathtakingly beautiful and is a lovely reflection of the awesome open spaces and magnificent nature of Wyoming.  The songs on the soundtrack are part of the sense of the movie and I truly value Willie Nelson's \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" and Emmy Lou Harris' \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old.\\"  This soundtrack is definitely an important part of your collection of music from the soundtracks of the great movies.

B000687M48|1.0|This CD was poorly produced and mixed.  It sounds like a bootlegged copy -- as it if were recorded by an audience member with a recorder tucked away in their trench coat.  Or perhaps the lead singer's mic wasn't working and the audio was being picked up by mics by the drummer or the guitarist.  I like Evanescence and their music -- but as a real audiophile, I was absolutely appalled and disturbed by the way this cd was mixed.  It is very difficult to listen to and to enjoy.  Very \\"tinny\\" and tough to hear the vocals.  I've purchased well over 500 CD's in my lifetime, and this is one of only a very select handful that I feel I should be able to return.

B00005OM4Q|5.0|Almost Famous is a near note-perfect recreation of the rock music millieu before it had exhausted itself in excess in the middle to later 70's. Director Cameron Crowe weaves heavy doses of his personal experiences into a fictional tale of how a hard working band, Stillwater, rises to stardom aided by all sorts of willing dreamers.<br /><br />The interactions between the band members and all of the people whose lives they touch are simply mezmerizing. Especially interesting is the examination of the range of participation that people have with music. Crowe differentiates in many shades between the casual and the romantic aspects of music: On the casual side we see music as a business -- its creators and fans as product to be sold or reported on, to be seen with or to have casual relationships with; On the romantic side we see music as a revelation unto itself -- it generates love to be shared between people.<br /><br />The characters and actors (great casting!) are all believable and, in the end, inspiring. The sex and drugs aspects are sanitized a bit, but then this is a love story with a relatively happy ending, not a tale of failed music.<br /><br />Some of the lighter fun includes all sorts of visual and spoken references to many of the premier performers of the early seventies: Bowie, Sabbath, The Who, Led Zep, Elton John, Allman Brothers, Joni Mitchell, Lou Reed and a blur of others...<br /><br />If you like the theatrical version and are interested in the autobiographical aspects in more detail, I highly recommend the director's cut. The mother-son relationship that seems somewhat implausable in the film was apparently right on the money, and Cameron Crowe did in fact skip 3 grades (one skip instigated by a simple mistake!) and graduated high school at the age of 15. The near airplane crash, the Lester Bangs relationship, the sister who leaves Cameron with her music collection and her wisdom and then meets him sitting alone in an airport -- all true!<br /><br />Another interesting note from the director's cut is that Cameron is married to Nancy Wilson of Heart and they co-wrote the fictional Stillwater band's songs and she wrote other parts of the soundtrack as well. Cameron also comments on several reactions to Almost Famous from bands or individuals that were included on the excellent soundtrack of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, In addition to the autobiographical richness, the director's cut adds insightful personal and relational depth to virutually every major character in the movie.<br /><br />Unless you really dislike the aforementioned musical sources, I recommend you take a look at this movie as a cultural historical document, if nothing else. If you enjoy music from that period of Rock or were growing up during that time, Almost Famous is not to be missed.director's cut is that Cameron is married to Nancy Wilson of Heart and they co-wrote the fictional Stillwater band's songs and she wrote other parts of the soundtrack as well.

Colin Firth is a perfect Mr. Darcy, no wonder it made him a heart throb.  The actress who plays Eliza is charming, and I wonder what has become of her.  She is not the usual waifish actress, which is refreshing.  Overall, this is a wonderful movie, sure to be a classic.
B000BGH22W|3.0|The \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" score is worth having for any fan of the Potter movies.  It's pleasant enough listening and works on a sentimental level, if you are fond of the most recent installment in the Potter series.  It unfortunately does not come close to matching John Williams' previous Potter scores; the difference is immediately noticable upon seeing the film, and certainly more so when listening to the music without the accompanying visuals.  The one exception that really grabs the listener is the recurring piece introducing the Bulgarian Quidditch team at the World Cup and the Durmstrang students at Hogwarts.  It's the strongest piece in the score, and all too brief.  The three pop songs at the end are more of an annoyance than anything.  \\"Do the Hippogriff\\" (which actually sounds a lot like \\"Scream\\" from the latest Billy Idol disc!) is a silly number that will grow on you, but I'm not sure that makes it any less irritating.  The other two, \\"This is the Night,\\" and \\"Magic Works\\" are a couple of stinkers that would just as well have been left out of the movie and the CD.  All in all, I would recommend this CD to anyone who has an attachment to the movie, and we'll cross our fingers that John Williams returns for \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" (now filming)!

0688170528|1.0|I started reading this book with high expectations since it was recommended to me by a friend who loved it.  I am terribly disappointed.  The book is filled with shallow, conceited characters and I had a hard time feeling sorry for, or even liking, most of them.  The whole plot just doesn't ring true.  Chris and Emily were basically pushed into an unnatural relationship by both sets of parents who were trying to live their lives vicariously through their children.  They seemed to have no lives or friends outside their rather incestuous little circle.  Do people really live this way?  I haven't finished the book yet so I don't know what the ending is, but I have no doubt it will be just as implausible as the rest of the story.  Don't waste your time.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I think that reviewer \\"euroman498\\" completely missed the point of this movie.  The producers were NOT trying to remake The Wizard of Oz.  You cannot even begin to call this film a remake--it was not based on the same book as the 1939 Judy Garland film.  I would be hard pressed to even call this a sequel, because although RETURN TO OZ is based off subsequent books in the Oz series (\\"Ozma of Oz\\" and \\"The Land of Oz\\"), there are too many differences from the 1939 film that prevent this from being a legitimate sequel.  RETURN TO OZ is better taken as a completely different Oz film in its own right.  You must realize since this and the 1939 film were based on entirely different books, that differences will exist.  You need to get over that.  I don't believe that Disney was just out to make a couple bucks off the Oz franchise, as they lavished quite a bit of money on this film.  As we all know, RETURN TO OZ very unjustly bombed at the box office, because all too many closed-minded, over-zealous fans of the MGM film cannot accept an Oz film with anyone besides Judy Garland as Dorothy.  Simply because the word \\"Oz\\" is in the title, people expect it to be a carbon copy of the 1939 film, complete with talking trees, flying monkeys, munchkins, 3 farm hands, Judy Garland, and lions, tigers, and bears (oh my!), along with dopey musical interludes dispersed throughout the picture.  That Judy Garland is not present in this film seems to be reason enough for many people to hate it and go about bashing it right and left--though few of them have actually seen it.    I must say that I had only seen RETURN TO OZ when it would occasionally air on television, and I never really paid much attention to it beyond that.  Then I rented the DVD one night after not having seen the film for awhile, and fell in love with it right away.  I ran out and bought a copy of the DVD the first chance I got.  Overkill, you might ask?  Maybe, but to this day RETURN TO OZ remains a favorite of mine.  And this coming from someone who does not particularly care for fantasy or sci-fi films.     The producers of RETURN TO OZ must be commended for the wonderful film they put together.  It is far more faithful to Baum than the MGM film ever was.  The characterizations seem to have come straight out of the books, and 10 year old Fairuza Balk is much closer in age to Baum's Dorothy--8 to 10 years old--than MGM's 16 year old Judy Garland.  And the score by David Shire is one of the underacclaimed glories of motion picture music.  While I enjoy the 1939 film, it is nothing more than a sugar-coated Judy Garland feature; an excuse for MGM to show off it technical opulence at the time, if you will.  I am ever so grateful that Disney did not stoop to that level with RETURN TO OZ, and instead made a film that L. Frank Baum would be proud of.       Don't get me wrong... I have always loved the 1939 film dearly, and will continue to do so.  It is rightfully a classic among the classics, and will remain a favorite of young and old forever.  You are certainly welcome to your opinion, euroman498, but it seems to me that you are too biased toward Judy Garland to even give RETURN TO OZ the time of day--this evidenced by the fact that you spend your entire review talking about Judy Garland.  You say that you have not seen RETURN TO OZ.  Then what business do you have posting biased reviews against it?  I strongly recommend you DO see it, euroman498; you might even find it to be one of the best films you have ever seen.    And any true fan of Judy Garland would know how to spell her name correctly.

My own advice to those getting hot and bothered about the \\"controversy\\": Think for yourself, don't let Oprah do it for you, and maybe you won't feel so cheated. If you are bent on exposing lies, look for ones that actually matter.
B0002F6AZC|2.0|3 short films?!?!? thats it?? i feel severly ripped off even after i picked this up used!  it feels like the skits that didnt make creephow 1 were mushed together onto this. chief wooden head isnt scary at all. if you think that is scary, you are easily frightened. the raft is defiantely the best on here by far. that blob thing does creep me out i shall admit. especially the ending to it!! the hitchhiker is so stupid i felt moronic for viewing this. there is nothing scary or funny about a bloody zombie that says \\"thanks for the ride lady\\" over and over. i just want to know why anchor bay released a stellar edition if this heap of scrap when they could have done creepshow 1 instead. that one is better. <br /> <br />two stars for \\"the raft\\" <br /> <br />if only they all held up like that story...
B00003CX8N|4.0|REVIEW: This is a charming little picture about a dowdy yet very opinionated New York woman who is a poor script reader/aspiring writer with a penchant for English literature. The woman (future bestselling author Helene Hanff) is played superbly by Anne Bancroft in one of her more subdued performances (albeit with one or two quirky scenes and tongue-in-cheek outbursts). She is exasperated trying to find the famous works of certain British authors, but is having no success with American bookstores who only cater to popular tastes. One day she sees an ad in a magazine from Marks & Co.: a small bookshop in London which sells \\"antiquated books\\". She decides to write to them with several of her \\"most pressing problems\\" (i.e. impossible to find titles), and thus begins a correspondence that would last for over twenty years. Although the shop is owned by Mr. Marks and Mr. Cohen: it is run by the quietly effecient Frank Doel (another classic Hopkins performance) who amply supplies Miss Hanff with beautiful yet cheap copies of the books she sorely desires. As the film progresses their friendship blossoms into a one-of-a-kind relationship insomuch as they never get to actually meet each other. For certain this makes for a very unusually constructed screenplay that (if it weren't based upon fact) would not be as believable. The flaw of the film is that it fails to convincingly address the extent of Hanff's poverty, and that the only reason she is finally able to travel to England after years of struggling is because of the publication of her memoirs, \\"84 CHARING CROSS ROAD\\", which she wrote in loving memory of Frank Doel and in honor of all those who worked at Marks & Co. whose lives she touched and whose lives touched hers as friends and literary comrads. It was only after the success of \\"84 CHARING CROSS ROAD\\" that Hanff was able to make it to England and to finally see the bookshop and to meet with Frank's family. But the movie doesn't end like that: instead we get a sceneof Hanff packing her suitcase out of the blue and booking a flight to England without any hint or rationale as to how she could afford it. And yes I know: the initial reason for the delay was because of her dental bill, but for goodness sakes it's nearly ten years later when she finally buys a plane ticket and goes. It makes it seem as if she could have done such a thing at any time during the movie, and that the only reason why she didn't was because of her own personal procrastination and/or because whe wanted to be known as a \\"woman of mystery\\" instead of the frumpy, intelligent-yet-unsophisticated person that she was. If the script had been re-written, and the ending explained in clearer terms then the film would be an unequivocable triumph. As it stands it is an endearing character study with a huge, unavoidable pothole at the end which hurts the overall excellence of the story.
B00003CXBH|5.0|...all give stellar performances in this film, which has quite possibly the best original soundtrack of any film in the past 50 years. The screenplay is uneven, but the cinematography is unforgettable.
B000003TAR|5.0|i just bought this albim and it is tha bomb. this is a great album. skinny puppy's 'last rights' is also a great album. there is room for the peaceful coexistence of many great albums, much in the same way that it is possible for apples and oranges to both be great fruits. by saying that an apple is a masterpiece of fruitmaking, the perfection of an orange's composition is not diminished. similarly, the beauty of nirvana's 'in utero' does not preclude the possibility for there to be other beautiful works of musical genius, namely those of distinctively different artists. on a different note, i am of the impression that nirvana was incapable of recording a bad song. certainly some are better than others, but all are chock-full of a mysterious quality which elevates them to a level of superbness regardless of the production quality. that being said, 'in utero' is an example of nirvana having recorded songs which, by my previous definition, are guaranteed to not be bad. also, the production quality is well above par. this album is wonderfully loud, noisy, and cathartic.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|what can i say, i was hoping that this was my dream melding of the tv version with the crappy naration and missing scenes and the theatrical release with good naration and missing scenes. but it's not, it's just both. while the mini series does cover the story better, lynch did capture the feel and look i'd always imagined, except for the wierding module stuff. whoever said that explained how the fremen defeated the sardukar missed the point that EVERYONE in this particular universe is armed with knives and pistols, because of personal shields. and yes, i know i'm a dork and that my spelling is terrible, which is besides the point.
B000BJS4BM|1.0|The c.d had a scratch on it.It was suppose to be brand new.It doesn't skip but thats still not right.I don't know how much it cost to send it back since i can't afford it anyways.
B00025ETIW|5.0|... and My Chemical Romance definitely owns a style of their own. To the trained ear, they may sound sloppy, and the like, but to untrained ears, they're absolutely wonderful -- almost everyone that I know loves MCR. I said almost. I listen to a variety of music, and yes, that includes my gangster shiz, and overplayed pop tunes, but honestly, this band is my *favorite* (and I honestly don't care what you people think about that). Gerard may not have an AWESOME singing voice, but it's so filled with emotion, and he does have his own style. The rest of the boys do, too, and I especially love the guitar parts, and the drumming. Although I cannot say the same for Mikey Way's bass-playing, the only song I can say that I heard him in was Ghost of You. (And from a girl's [non-goth.] P-O-V, he's uber adorable. :P ) <br /> <br />My absolute favorite songs on this album are... : all of them. <br /> <br />N.B. -- this is but one girl's opinion, so don't judge others on it.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Capote is first and foremost about the author and his non-fiction book.  Most people rave about Hoffman playing Capote, because he talks like him, and he acts like him. While these take a great amount of skill, the reason why Hoffman deserves the Oscar this year is not for these traits, but because he is an actor playing a very deceptive and manipulative person - which is one of the hardest roles for an actor to play.  Also, there are several scenes where the actor is very torn about some of the decisions he has to make - there is a very high price to pay for manipulation it would seem.  Even in the end, we still do not know his motives or how he really felt about the subject of his book - though I would like to think that he cared a great deal about him.  <br /> <br />Another great thing about this movie (besides Hoffman) was the cinematography - some absolutely brilliant shots.  A good look at small town Americana, and also the ritzy party-it-up lush style of NY in the 1950's.  The supporting roles were good - Harper Lee's actress does a very good job - but they are mostly just there as a backdrop to Capote himself. <br /> <br />All in all, one of the best films I have seen in a very long time.  Without a doubt the best I have seen this year (2005).  I would love to see it win Best Picture, but doubt that it will due to its small distribution.  If Hoffman doesn't win Best Actor however, I will boycott the Oscars for a long time.
B0002EXH40|5.0|This is Megadeths most melodic album vocally and musically, some people seem to have a problem with this but they are the one's missing out!. Slowing down didnt hurt the band at all but many of the speed thrash heads were too cool to even give this a chance, but luckily those are the same people who never got over the 80s. It also features there best and most powerfully beautiful song \\"A Tout Le Monde\\".... \\"Addicted To Chaos\\" has a fat heavy chug without compromising the melody. If you are new to megadeth ( like i was when i first heard this ) its not exactly a generalised DETH sound but it is really really good classic/style melodic metal, and if thats what you are looking for then you wont be dissapointed. Check It Out!
B0009S3HI0|4.0|well when i first saw the commercial advertising this cd/dvd complete with unreleased tracks and every one of the Deftones' music videos, i was quite exited.  <br />upon buying it and listening to the cd, i did expect a little more but i can say that it was worth buying. the songs that stood out to me the most on the cd would have to be the Helmet cover, The Cure cover, the acoustic version of Be Quiet and Drive and No Ordinary Love, which is flawless. <br />the dvd is awesome. it has the Deftones video collection plus a live video for Root. i do wish there could have been more interviews and live performances, but i can't complain. its definetly worth the money and a must have for any Deftones fan. <br />
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|I would highly recommend this to any Tull fan who also loves Christmas!  It was hard putting it away with the decorations after the holidays!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I was a John Mayer fan before--but this is just amazing!  It is more my style with blues and rock all rolled into one. I can't wait for more from John Mayer Trio. \\"Vultures\\" and \\"Out of My Mind\\" are my personal favorites-but all are great.
1932100385|5.0|This book details the differences between the typical \\"North American Diet\\" and diets more commonly found in China. Not surprisingly, most North Americans, whose diet tends toward more calories, more sugar, more saturated fat---and whose lifestyle is more sedentary, tend to develop diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, other vascular disorders, cancer, etc. Those who are more active, and who subsist on lower calorie diets high in vegetables, whole grains and fruit, do not develop these diseases. The inescapable conclusion is that if we changed our diet we would be healthier. <br />Nothing new here, but the study is fascinating nonetheless.
0380789019|5.0|I loved the series, so was a bit loathe to read the novelization. This was a surprisingly fun novel to read-- and I was sorry that it ended.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|The whole series plus extras.  True fans will love every minute of it... and no commercial interruptions or censorship like the syndicated re-runs.  Great investment!
B000AP04EW|4.0|Mr. & Mrs. Smith is as awesome action twist on the War of the Rose's. If you like The Rose's, you'll love The Smith's. Lots of great action shots in the making of this movie... and then there's Angelina Jolie. Need I say more?
B000084T18|1.0|man this stuff is wack. vanilla ice had more phat beets then this poser. too bad he wasn't shot a tenth time and died.
B000059S9D|4.0|Saw them live for the first time a few months ago and what an amazing band. This CD was purchased for three songs, hatesong, lightbulb sun and russia on ice but soon loved every song. If you like Deadwing and In Absentia you must have this also.
B00006LFGD|4.0|Fun to listen to.    Wonderful duet partners.   enjoyed it very much
B0006L16N8|5.0|I haven't listened to the entire album but if you love U2, you will love this album.
0446310786|5.0|There are some books that are so good they make you a better person by just reading them and 'To Kill a Mocking Bird' is one that does just that. From the prose, to the characters, plot and sub-plots, it is an utterly enchanting book. Atticus Finch is one of my most beloved characters in all of literature. I find the book excruciatingly gentle and pure, due in part to the corruption of the main plot contrasted with the tender setting. Kids don't know any better, as Jem and Scout represent, that they are not supposed to like others for the color of their skin or the cloths that they wear. Only the adults infect the world with hatred, even though Scout's got some bad temper; it, too, is simple anger. As with all great stories there is an overwhelming sense of suspense about Boo Radley, the town and even the fact that Atticus is the best shot in the county. Although the gentleness of the setting and some of the characters,e.g Scout, Jem and Dill, there is yet an over arching sense of tragedy that hangs over the book. It almost seems that Scout is recounting, through the narration, an unimaginably horrible time of her life that only recently healed enough to recount. And yet the summer days with Dill and Jem are told with misty nostalgia of a better time and place, that could neverlast, but that is for grown-ups. Race is one of the main issues that faces America still, that dare to live up to the words \\"that all men are created equal.\\" Just as pertinent today as when the Jim Crow laws were still in effect. Childhood is a time of innocence and forgiveness; where adulthood is hard and unjust. As Scout and Jem learn, even physically with Jem's twisted arm,the illusions of youth are ripped away, and the harsh realities stand out in stark contrast.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris has written the best book about the state of religion and politics that I've ever read. He is concise and to the point in his unrelenting pursuit of the bigger truths we face. If members of the major political parties of the world read and understood his thesis we would be better for it. Readers should pass on the difficult lessons found between these covers . . . GO FORTH AND SPREAD THE NEWS!
0156027321|5.0|best book I've read since DaVinci Code.  Leaves you feeling great and an unbelievable ending.
0553260111|5.0|When it all comes down to it, sometimes you have to go with what first comes to mind. I've wanted to read Ludlum for some time. The question is, what do you possibly start with? There are times when I've had a certain author in mind, and BOOM! THAT book just looks like the book to start with. But the \\"Bourne\\" books were signature of Robert Ludlum. (along with a couple of his other books) and I had my choices. But I decided I wanted to read this first. To be honest, I'd seen the movie, and really wasn't that impressed. Well, then you start reading \\"The Bourne Identity\\"... MATT DAMON AS JASON BOURNE?! I don't think so! Rumor has it that \\"Bourne Supremacy\\" is a lot better, but I'll be safe and read that first. This absolutely KILLED the movie!!!<br /><br />So who is this stranger? Who is Jason Bourne? How the heck does this sucker know 3 different languages? The fact of the matter is this: HE DOESN'T KNOW EITHER! But it's coming back to him, slowly but surely. I thought the fight scenes were awesome, which gives Jason Bourne a more macho, more sophisticated than Matt Damon. And Jason Bourne gets his girl too! I guess to be a little fair to the movie, you do have over 500 pages to deal with, so you aren't really going to do too much justice. And I'd like to be mildly blunt to the reviewers (whomever you may be) that thought the movie was better than this. Actually read the book! Robert Ludlum is a genius with the pen, so it puts him up there. He's been dead for a few years... it STILL PUTS HIM UP THERE!<br /><br />Robert Ludlum has been a favorite for a number of years. He was probably a favorite before I was born. This man will be a favorite long after the rest of us are long gone! I guess that means I'd better start reading rather quickly, or live a long, long life!
B00003CXRM|5.0|The characters and setting of this movie brought back memories of my childhood.  I believe that I knew people that would have fit right into the story line.  A simple life where a man was only as good as his word.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|A good album at last. <br />I saw the Plant Show in Milan and i was very happy for good sound, great voice and impressive show. <br />Lot of good song, rock, blues, ballad, very good voice. <br />The band is strong too. <br />Not as good as Led Zeppelin, but if you like Plant and Zep you'll like also this album.
0307276902|4.0|Regardless of the recent disclosure of part fictional text......Oprah was right that this is a page turner and a must read. It is about addiction .....who can't learn something more about that?
B000BVQ9JO|2.0|First off, let me say I liked the Strokes' first two albums and I think they put on a great live show. Now, as for this new album, blah. The Strokes are good at short, simple, fun songs. Their first two albums were quick and to the point,  the songs were around three minutes long, and both albums were under 40 minutes. This new one just goes on and on, the songs are long, drawn out and pointless, and the band's fun energy has been replaced by annoying screaming. Aside from a few highlights, this album is a bummer and a step back for the band. See what happens when you hang out with Drew Barrymore too long?
B000BJS4BM|5.0|Great CD.  It's an hour long and all the songs are great, they all make you wanna get up and dance. The bonus track is worth the price, but the picture book and the journal you can do without, except you're a big fan. But it's worth it.
0307276902|1.0|This story has obviously been tarnished and there is immense reason to doubt every word that James Frey says and writes due to the current controversy. This book should have been published as a fiction and I don't think it's worthy enough to be endorsed by Oprah. <br /> <br />Frey doesn't have the ability to write. Words are repeated over and over and over again. There is an insane and annoying amount of the word \\"and\\". He obviously has no sense of puncuation and there are no quotation marks within the enitre book. This book is a grammar and/or literature professor's nightmare. The author writes like a jr. high student and is even less articulate. I have serious doubts that this entire text was read by a single editor, publisher, or even copy editor. If you have respect for words and sentence structure then you should never read this story! <br /> <br />The plot is simple and reminded me so much of the movie \\"Manic\\" with Don Cheadle. The characters are easily forgettable. In fact, at the end there is a short section of updates about the characters and I didn't know who half of them were. I found it incredibly hard to feel sympathy for James and his time in rehab.  I couldn't even force myself to care if he stayed sober or not. He is a name dropper while trying not to drop names. Describing someone as a rock star with the famous lips, among others. He's begging for the readers to try to figure out who he saw and met while in rehab; even though he should be trying to maintain confeditiality on their behalf. <br /> <br />I am close friends with an addict who has stayed sober for four years. His descriptions of rehab are nothing similar to what James went through. It seems James spent more of his time socializing than truly utilizing his parents' money with honest rehabilitation. I also know that it's incredibly common for addicts to lie about their usage and lives; perhaps this was the problem for Frey. However, when the author states numerous times how important honesty and the truth is to him, then he should respect his potential readers with offering the truth. <br /> <br />In the end, considering the current controversy or not, this is a poorly written book that is not inspirational. It only caused me to dislike the author because of his bad boy attitude and lack of consideration for the people who were trying to help him. If you really think you absolutely have to read this book, save your money and go to a library. Frey shouldn't make anymore money from this lackluster story.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|At first I believed this CD to sound like Fall Out Boy and was a little disappointed. But then I really listened to all of the CD, then compared it to the other band. They really don't sound anything alike. Next to Panic!, FOB sounds slightly bland. Their music is catchy, something you can dance and sing to, but the lyrics are unique and all their own, adn the songs flow very nicely into one another. <br />I could rate the CD song by song, but honestly, I would end up giving them all 10's. I even love the Intermission. <br />I have listened to this CD almost non-stop since I ordered it and I highly recommend it.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I remember getting heavy into Ride The Lightning as a junior in high school and having some moronic potheads tell me that Metallica had sold out.  Same thing here: this is a great album from a group of young dudes that, at first glance, don't look remotely capable of producing such music.  City of Evil is a creative kludge of GNR, Faith No More, and STP (and many others).  There are times when listening to this album that I begin to believe that Mike Patton and Scott Weiland are on lead vocals, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, Ritchie Blackmore, Big Jim Martin, Slash, and Joe Satriani are on guitar, and Neil Peart and Puff are pounding on the skins.  This album is solid and well produced from beginning to end.  To all those that call these guys a sellout: true and great musicians always progress...  bad ones scream and play loud to cloak their lack of talent.  Not that there's anything wrong with a little screaming.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My kids love Christmas and trains so this movie was perfect for them.  After reading the book several times, this movie really makes the story come alive.  I definitely recommend it.
B0007OASII|5.0|Kamelot's latest release The Black Halo is a masterpiece among the Power Metal classics. Filled with headbang worthy riffs, pummeling Drums and original Bass lines. The vocals on The Black Halo are the best vocalist Khan has yet to offer us, Deep, Melodic and Powerful. Each song is immensly well arranged and keeps to a dark/melodic power metal fusion unlike any before. Numerous jaw dropping Guitar solos fit well within each track they are placed within. Numerous drum sections stand apart from the music giving the song a more atmospheric quality about it. The Bass lines aren't as well distinguished as the rest but still of very good quality and some even seem fairly complex for a Power Metal release. Now the part that truely made this album as great as it is, The keyboards & orchestral arrangements! Simply amazing, the arrangements are easily the best i've yet to hear in a Rock or Metal album to date, Full of melodic, Dark & Epic orchestral arrangments. This is a MUST for all Metal fans! Also curious rock or dark/gothic music fans may be able to appreciate this jem.<br /><br />-TRACK RATING-<br /><br />KEY:  Song Title - Rating - Song Length - Short Description<br /><br />March of Mephisto - 6 out of 5 - 5:29 - An amazing start to an incredible album. This is one of the best opening tracks i've ever heard, It serves as preview of things later in the album. Some may or may not know but Shagrath of Dimmu Borgir has a small guest appearance through out the song. I love the tempo change roughly 3:13 into the song. This is easily my fav song on the album.<br /><br />When The Lights Are Down - 5 out of 5 - 3:41 - Old Skool meets New Skool Power Metal. This song has a classic Power Metal feel to it, The Orchestral arrangements though small give it a much more original then your garden variety Power Metal band.<br /><br />The Haunting (somewhere in time) - 5 out of 5 - 5:40 - Solid/Melodic Rock, I always sing along with this song due to its extremely catchy Chorous. The beautiful male & female vocals are enough, But the band doesn't let that stop them from giving their best. Classic Metal Guitar Solo included.<br /><br />Soul Society - 5 out of 5 - 4:17 - Melodicly Heavy is the key to this beast of a finish for the first part of the album. You'll be singing along \\"How Can We Beleve In Heaven\\" in no time. And at around 2:55 into the song begins an excellent tempo change and incorpirates a small part of Classic Accoustic Guitar.<br /><br />Interlude I - 4 out of 5 - 0:57 - A quick break after an excellent begining, The Interludes are very well done and always blend into the before and after track well.<br /><br />Abandoned - 5 out of 5 - 4:07 - One the best Power Metal Ballads i've yet to hear that starts out extremely melodic and slowly the music picks up. The vocals are amazing, Khan truely shows his worth here, With excellent song writing and vocals. At about 2:26 the song begins to quicken and soon the drums kicking in leading into a ballad of epic porportions<br /><br />This Pain - 5 out of 5 - 3:59 - Excellent Power Metal Rocker, One of my fav songs on the album and some of the most interesting guitar work on the album. Khan uses some minimal vocal effects during this one give his tone a sort of dubbled over sound. But as I said its the guitars that shine here some of the most original on the album.<br /><br />Moonlight - 5 out of 5 - 5:10 - Amazing straight forward Power Metal classic, The chourus alone makes this song a 5 pointer. This is one of the tracks where the Bass gets a more central role and it works well and makes the guitars soo much better. This song has a very melodic and almost mystic feel to it<br /><br />Interlude II - 5 out of 5 - 0:40 - I love this interlude because it just stands out and has a Gypsy type feel to it.<br /><br />The Black Halo - 5 out of 5 - 3:43 - Back to basics here as the Title track is just your common Power Metal rocker.. Though common its done so well that its actually better then your common Power Metal filler track. Easily my fav guitar solo on the album is within this one,<br /><br />Nothing Ever Dies - 5 out of 5 - 4:45 - The band seems very together here, Its just a plain out rocker.. No glam just pure head banging obviously to get you ready for the next track..<br /><br />Memento Mori - 10 out of 5 - 8:54 - This song takes a piece of everything heard on The Black Halo, From its more melodic parts to its more epic parts and the heavier sides of the album. Shagrath came back to add guest vocals once again on this masterpiece. This is a MUST HEAR track.. It just builds up and builds up and builds up and then finally lets loose.. This is a song of Classic value and should be respected as one of the greatest Power Metal tracks ever.<br /><br />Interlude III - 5 out of 5 - 1:21 - This interlude infact plays everything you've just heard backwards and sped up, Its a nice lil break after that last song.<br /><br />Serenade - 5 out of 5 - 4:44 - I was expecting this to be a very melodic end.. Well I was right and wrong, This is a very Melodic Power Metal Jam to finish it off, and it works well keeping a steadily heavy and classic power metal feel through out, This is the way Power Metal albums should end. Has some very interesting guitar work through out to finish up this amazing album.<br /><br />All in all I feel that Kamelots The Black Halo should have been and to me IS 2005's album of the year. This is one of the most Original Power Metal albums ever created and they did it flawlessly. Kamelot is now easily my fav Power Metal band, Their next album will tell if they are worthy of being among the Power Metal warlords (Iced Earth, Dragonforce ETC..) But if they get better then this.. Well we may see new KINGS of The Power Metal Genre. Keep your fingers crossed for an American tour.. Cause these guys are going to blow away America if they come through.ly better then your common Power Metal filler track. Easily my fav guitar solo on the album is within this one,  <br /> <br />Nothing Ever Dies - 5 out of 5 - 4:45 - The band seems very together here, Its just a plain out rocker.. No glam just pure head banging obviously to get you ready for the next track.. <br /> <br />Memento Mori - 10 out of 5 - 8:54 - This song takes a piece of everything heard on The Black Halo, From its more melodic parts to its more epic parts and the heavier sides of the album.

0425152251|4.0|Sophie's world is a truly interesting book. It is written by award  <br />winning author Jostein Gaarder. This book is about a fourteen year old named Sophie Amundsen. She's a normal girl with a mother and a father, but her father travels a lot for his business.  <br />       One day after walking home from school she went through her mail and there was a letter with only her name and her address on it. No return address and no name of the sender. Quite mysterious. She opened it and on the piece of paper inside it read, \\"Who are you\\"? and \\"Where does the world come from\\"? She didn't know what to make of it.                             <br />          Throughout the book, there are more and more philosophical questions asked by the mysterious sender and the reader is guided through  philosophy lessons along  with Sophie. <br />          The lessons that are written out in the book are almost like time travel because you are reading about different thinkers from different times. This book is good for either the beginner or expert in philosophy because it is written in a way that if you think you know everything about philosophy you will still learn something and if your just a beginner, it's written at just the right level that you can still understand all the main points and have a good time reading it. <br />           If you are intimidated by the 513 pages, don't be. Each page is a real adventure and they go by extremely quickly. If you are like me and used to reading small books  like Scooby Doo mystery novels, this book is a real step in the right direction in terms of books. It is a very complex book but I think every one will be able to understand the vocabulary. <br /> <br />    I have tried to learn philosophy other ways (other books, television,  <br />ect.), but I have found this the easiest way. I find philosophy  <br />fascinating and I think that it is an important part of education. It  <br />truly saddens me that it isn't being taught more places. <br />        What I find to be one of the best things about the book is that it can fit in your pocket. I don't think I could have finished the book if I  <br />didn't bring everywhere I went. Also it's really cheap. Eight bucks  <br />sure beats a seventy dollar philosophy text book. <br />          The history of Philosophy was probably the most fascinating part for me.  The book goes back to before Christ. It describes what they thought and what the questions were throughout time. It talks about famous philosophers like Socrates and Parmenides and what they did to build upon the philosophical world. And of course, the most interesting thing is that while times change, the questions that we ask ourselves really don't change at all. <br />         There are other questions in the book that are personal questions like \\" Who is Hilde\\"? and \\"Who is Alberto Knox\\"? When you read the book you will find out all about these characters and the development of the  <br />philosophical part of Sophie. <br /> <br />           As the book continues, Sophie starts to question our universe. She becomes so involved with the questions philosophy asks that she loses all sense of reality. The letters gradually become such an important part of her life that they begin to take over her life. She spends more and more time reading the letters, thinking about the questions the letters ask and constructing philosophical experiments.  <br />             I will let you read it to find out what happens. But it does put  <br />philosophy into perspective. There is so much. I cannot comprehend how  <br />much philosophy there is in the universe because we can really question  <br />any thing. Even this book. <br /> <br />    If you don't like or if your not interested in philosophy this is not  <br />your kind of book. Some may say this book is pretentious and stupid. But if you are interested on reflecting on questions both big and small then this book fits like a nice tuxedo. <br /><br />    <br />
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is tragically wonderful, as seen through the eyes of a child coping and becoming a young adult filled with despair, poverty, death, and an alcoholic, jobless father.<br /><br />I've read this book twice and each time I felt it hard to put the book down, after reading Angela's Ashes the first time, I vacationed in Ireland and toured Limerick, this has made Angela's Ashes even more meaningful for me.<br /><br />Even though this book is very sad, there are a few humorous parts in it, and just like Frank McCourt writes in the first page \\"the happy childhood is hardly worth your while\\" kind of sets this book off to relive all that McCourt lived through and survived. I whole-heartedly recommend this book.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|The idea of the movie has great promise. But the story needs more work. It wasn't until a while into the movie, that it actually got good, at the story of the vain queen. But it quickly becomes boring again... and then it picks up again. A lot of starts and stops, til the very end! Only get this movie, if you have extra money to burn.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|After I saw Serenity in theaters, it sparked my interest in that short-lived show it was a continuation of, Firefly.  Once I got the series on DVD I was hooked, with the interesting plots and funny, yet deep characters.  I watched practically one of the four discs a night until I finished it.  It is a real shame that Fox had to axe this great show after not even a whole season, but this set is nonetheless a great collection.
B000957O82|4.0|Our link brought us to this site, hoping to find more about Casper Andreas, director and star of SLUTTY SUMMER. We have no recollection of Casper Andreas appearing in HITCH so why was he linked to Hitch at amazon.com, via SLUTTY SUMMER? Will Smith is dark and delightful and Kevin James is silky and luxurious, but the lack of any real memorable contribution by Casper Andreas is palpable and lowers our rating to four stars.
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|Although less a review than a basic analogy, Peter Segal's 2005 remake of \\"The Longest Yard\\" is to Robert Aldrich's 1974 prison football epic as 2005 star Adam Sandler is to 1974 leading man Burt Reynolds.<br /><br />While Reynolds' Paul Crewe was a trademark '70s anti-hero, a pigskin-chucking sibling to the pragmatic rebels played by the likes of Jack Nicholson or Gene Hackman, the only real antecedent for Sandler's Crewe are the actor's own highly financially successful string of athletic loveable misfits, a character more intellectually gifted than Bobby Boucher of \\"The Waterboy\\" and more sedate than the title character in \\"Happy Gilmore.\\" Reynolds could play self-destructive and willfully belligerent, a man who could demand and receive respect in the most precarious of situations. Even if he's trying to play a superstar jock, Sandler is a benign doofus, an Everyman as comfortable in a maximum security prison as Britney Spears would be at a Mensa meeting.<br /><br />Glossy where the original was gritty and raw, silly where the original was scabrously funny, cartoonish where the original was dangerous and threatening, this new \\"Longest Yard\\" aims only to be a diverting summer lark. With the help of a game and eclectic supporting cast and a spunky (but never convention-challenging) attitude, it succeeds admirably.<br /><br />Sheldon Turner's adapted screenplay stands by Tracy Keenan Wynn's original script down to the tiniest of plot details, lifting every twist and many of the most pointed conversations. Sandler is Paul \\"Wrecking\\" Crewe, a former NFL MVP quarterback booted from the league for allegedly fixing a game. He bottoms out in an elaborate escalating traffic violation that lands him in Allenville Federal Penitentiary, the personal fiefdom of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a martinet passionate about his prison football team and his own political aspirations. Distressed by his team's recent stumbles, the warden entrusts Crewe to put together a squad of inmates to go against the guards in what he assumes will be a season-opening rout. What he doesn't understand is that for the Mean Machine, this game will be a chance at revenge and vindication.<br /><br />Buried amidst the portrait of a disparate group of men bonding in adverse circumstances (a trademark Aldrich theme), the original \\"Longest Yard,\\" also questioned the rehabilitating possibilities of the penal system, with an interesting racial critique on the side. Sandler's version strips away most of the thematic richness, sprinkling cheap laughs on the already fertile framework like so much natural fertilizer. None of the changes in this new version is more telling than the reimagination of the warden's secretary, a lusty young Bernadette Peters in 1974, a randy and perverse (and hilarious) Cloris Leachman now. Throw in a gang of cross-dressing cheerleaders (led by Tracy Morgan), prison sodomy jokes galore and repeated references to the prodigious size of wrestler Bill Goldberg's, um, Gold-member and this \\"Longest Yard\\" isn't better, but it's probably funnier.<br /><br />Chris Rock assists with the wisecracking humor as Caretaker, one of those obligatory prison movie inmates who knows all of the loopholes and catches in the system. Rock's acerbic one-liners are sharper than anything else in the film conveying the impression that nobody forced him to stick to the script.<br /><br />The easy interplay between Rock and Sandler probably helped create a comfortable work environment for the cast's legion of non-thespians. The reliable character actors (Cromwell, William Fichtner), genuine football stars (Michael Irvin, Brian Bosworth and Bill Romanowski) and professional wrestlers (Goldberg, Steve Austin) blend perfectly. None of the non-actors embarrass themselves and Cowboys' great Irvin, stretching as a star wide receiver, and rapper Nelly, as an unstoppable running back, are big screen naturals. Less successful are the appearances by various ESPN personalities, particularly Chris Berman, who proves to be even more ingratiating when his shtick is written for him than when he works off the cuff.<br /><br />Reynolds shows up in an extended cameo and he even gets the movie star entrance, striding in purposeful slo-motion with the sun setting behind him, but his presence is mostly a reminder that even at a mind-bogglingly spry 69, he's more convincing as a sporting legend than Sandler.<br /><br />Although he and Sandler have had hits with their previous collaborations (\\"Anger Management,\\" \\"50 First Dates\\"), this is easily Segal's most accomplished film. Much of the credit probably goes to Oscar-winning cinematographer Dean Semler (\\"Dances with Wolves\\"), who works with Segal to deliver vigorous football action -- set, often music video-style, to an assortment of classic rock favorites and hip hop -- to accompany the comic scenes and even one or two moments of actual pathos.<br /><br />At some point this summer, a literate independent film will be released with an R-rating because of a fleeting glimpse of a nipple or because characters discuss a sexual relationship in an emotionally honest matter (something in the \\"Raising Victor Vargas\\" vein), preventing responsible young adults from seeing the movie. When that happens, I hope those filmmakers point to \\"The Longest Yard\\" and its PG-13 rating as a sign of the MPAA ratings board's ongoing hypocrisy. Whatever the limits are for casual verbal obscenity, crass dialogue and jokes about sexual deviance, this movie pushes them.<br /><br />Sandler's core audience of young male teens and frat boys will love this movie, but the Boys Club tone (Leachman and Courteney Cox, in a fleeting cameo, are the token females) may turn off distaff viewers who would rather see the funnyman romance Drew Berrymore than do hard time.es, particularly Chris Berman, who proves to be even more ingratiating when his shtick is written for him than when he works off the cuff.  <br /> <br />Reynolds shows up in an extended cameo and he even gets the movie star entrance, striding in purposeful slo-motion with the sun setting behind him, but his presence is mostly a reminder that even at a mind-bogglingly spry 69, he's more convincing as a sporting legend than Sandler.  <br /> <br />Although he and Sandler have had hits with their previous collaborations (\\"Anger Management,\\" \\"50 First Dates\\"), this is easily Segal's most accomplished film.

B000AWYOG4|2.0|This movie starts out great, but after a while it turns into a psychological thriller... and not a very good one. There are so many emotional issues and struggles of the main character, Dahlia, which completely takes over most of the movie. The little ghost girl is hardly a character at all and her story was completely summarized over, though it should have been Dahlia's story that was summarized. Normally don't mind these types of stories about a struggling mother dealing with childhood issues, but why set it up in \\"horror\\" skin clothing in the trailers? I was ready for a night, where I had to sleep with the light on. Instead, I was cheated.
068483605X|5.0|In High School I was forced to read much of this novel...and I hated it. It felt grueling and bored the pants off of me...talking rabbits, give me a break.<br /><br />But recently, I felt the urge to give this book another try. I kept passing it over in the library before finally deciding to see what I remember. Three days later I had read it through and have thought about starting it again. Now this is one of my top ten favorite novels.<br /><br />The basic plot (without any spoilers, I hate when reviewers give away the whole bloody story) has to do with a few rabbits, Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and several others who leave their warren because of a horrible preminision seen by Fiver.<br />After traveling the country side and running into some other rabbits with a terrible secret they refuse to speak of, the troop of bunnies make it to a large hill named Watership Down and begin a new warren. After beginning to settle in, something disturbing appears, one of the rabbits that remained behind in their original home warren has shown up unexpectedly with terrible news...<br /><br />I know the whole talking rabbit idea sounds lame, but this truly is a great, entertaning novel, and I think if you give it a shot you may just enjoy it.<br /><br />My advice: Don't Pay Attention to this Book or any other in High School. Every book you are forced to read becomes a hated enemy, Moby-Dick, Shakespeare etc. They all suck in High School, but when you get out, read them on your own for pleasure and you'll see the light.
0486227073|1.0|I bought 16 different Anatomy Drawing books and this is the only one that I actually felt compelled to give away.  When the other people say the drawings are faded and sketchy that is an understatement.  This is not a good book to learn by and it was not very effective in the design approach.  Your much better off with some Dynamic Figure Drawing, Dynamic Hands, Dynamic Wrinkles, Artistic Anatomy, Anatomy for Artists, An Atlas of Anatomy For Artists, etc etc etc.  Some of the other books I listed are almost the same price and are 10 times better.  Its night and day between this book and the other Anatomy Drawing books.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|ITS BEEN AWHILE SINCE A BAND ACTUALLY PLAYED THEIR INSTRUMENTS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF TALENT AND SKILL. ONE TUNE IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER. THIS BAND IS THE CHILD OF GUNS/ROSES AND MOTLEY CRUE...AND IN THIS ERA OF BORING MUSIC IT IS REFRESHING
B000AGTPUK|5.0|My son was two and a half when we first watched this movie with him on Thanksgiving. After that night, we watched it at least twenty more times until Christmas. My son was mesmermized, as his father and I were every time. We also were teary eyed just about every time at the touching messages about believing, friendship, caring for those in need and the simple gift of the magic of the holidays. We shared the movie with family and friends and they all loved it too. My son's favorite part was when the song, \\"Hot Chocolate\\" played so we had to buy the music CD, which he danced and sang to all holiday season and best of all it made him want to read the book the movie was based on every night, all of December. Finally, Matthew (who's name means gift) keeps saying to us even now, \\"Mommy...Peter never, never, heard the sound...the bell...until he believed\\".  Okay, so you are rolling your eyes and thinking this is too corny now, but just like the movie says, \\"the important thing to know about trains is that you have to get on\\".
B0000AZKLF|5.0|This is a fantastic CD where student meets teacher.  And yes, the student surpasses the teacher in the speed and dexterity category, but the ability to express the soul with the guitar is something that is unique to both Albert and Stevie and they are monsters.  I've always been a SRV fan and when I learned that Albert King was his mentor, I can see why.  Albert was definitely one of the greats.  This performance was a great idea and you ought to grab this cd for your library while you can.
B00005JO1Y|5.0|Although I have never had the chance to see the 1933 original version of \\"King Kong\\" starring the late Fay Wray as of writing this review, I was glowing with excitement when I heard that Peter Jackson would be the director of the 2005 remake of this major classic especially how he tackled the impossible task of doing \\"Lord of The Rings\\" and creating three masterpieces. With the dawn of the post-LOTR era the 2005 remake of \\"King Kong\\" proves that there is more to Pete than just \\"Lord Of The Rings\\". I was completely blown away by his take on the popular classic saga and gives the movie a whole new look.<br /><br /> The story begins in New York City during the early 1930s in the depths of the Great Depression caused by the \\"Black Thursday\\" Stock Market Crash of 1929 with rampant unemployment and `Hoovervilles' springing up all over Central Park and elsewhere. Amidst the turmoil an ambitious filmmaker Carl Denham strives to make it rich by producing a motion picture broadway show. It just so happens that a young woman named Ann Darrow also aims to strike it big by entering the Broadway business but her dream is damaged when the place she was aiming to jump-start her career is shuttered. It just so happens that Denhan and Darrow's worlds collide when he convinces her to ride on a ship to a mysterious island near Indonesia called Skull Island to make a movie in order to finally make it big. What they find there is beyond anything they ever thought possible. First is a mysterious tribe with a vicious cult personality and they end up being captured and are believed to being sacrificed in a tribal ritual. Ann Darrow was a particular favorite of the tribe and they finally see what they were being `sacrificed' too.
0142001104|5.0|In a very easy to read style, using lots of personal examples, Zander explains how a positive attitude and approach to those you work with or lead (He is an orchestra conductor) results in great things happening. Each chapter has a relevant \\"lesson\\", and overall it's a great read for anyone interested in creating a positive, supportive environment for those around them. There are a lot of books on this subject, but this one stands out.
B00005U122|5.0|As any true Pink Floyd fan knows, Roger was the soul of Floyd. He was Pink. Though no one can match David Gilmour on the guitar, Floyd is not Floyd without Roger, and he certainly proves it on this dvd. The selection of songs could not be any better except for the missing Great Gig in the Sky. The musicians are great, the vocalist are great and Roger is superb. I highly recommend this dvd. The quality of both the visual and audio are excellant as well. gbruce

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have never even heard of this show until about two weeks ago. I'm so glad it's out on DVD because it's one of the best shows that I have ever watched on television. I'm a fan of science fiction such as The X-Files and Stargate SG-1, and they have Firefly classified as Science Fiction, and I guess technically it is, but it's really more of just an action/comedy set in the future because it's not real heavy on the \\"science\\" part. <br /> <br />All of the characters are great and would have loved to see each one in three or more seasons but that's not going to happen. Some of my favorite episodes are <br /> <br />Serenity parts 1 and 2 <br />The Train Job <br />Bushwacked <br />Shindig <br />Safe <br />Our Mrs Reynolds <br />Jaynestown <br />Out of Gas <br />Ariel <br />War Stories <br />Trash <br />The Message <br />Heart of Gold <br />Objects in Space <br /> <br />Oh... I guess that would be the entire set ;)
B00004WLXZ|5.0|This movie is a masterpiece. You do, however, have to approach it with the right frame of mind. <br /> <br />It's very similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey, in that it's an EXPERIENCE rather than being a MOVIE. The same ones who were bored with 2001: will be bored here, too. Not much happens; Triumph of the Will is a documentary with very little plot. The  viewer needs to try to watch it in the spirit of the times, and try to absorb everything that is going on. If you're expecting a high-action movie, better skip this one. <br /> <br />Previous reviews have intellectualized the movie. While this has tremendous merit, viewers who haven't seen the movie don't really know what to expect when they buy it. <br /> <br />It starts out with Hitler coming out of the Clouds like some demi-god. He lands the plane, exits to a hysterical crowd, and travels through a spectacularly beautiful Nuremberg to get to the Events. You get to see volumes of ecstatic German populace worshipping him, while you worship the beautiful scenery. Too bad it's gone now. <br /> <br />Then, you see preparations for the event. Schoolkids sleeping in tents, frolicking around, having a good time, eating, washing up each other in the shower, etc. (One does get a feeling of some nascient homoeroticism).  <br /> <br />The movie then moves into the Festivities. <br /> <br />You watch massive formations of humans--perhaps 200,000 of them, alternately marching in formation, forming spectacular displays of choreography, avowing their reverence for the Fuhrer--while interspersed with speeches made by leading Nazis. The choreography is hypnotic, mesmerizing--it'll remind you somewhat of those Busby Berkely movies from the 30s. And the speeches aren't boring, at least to me--you see glimpses of the German mindset before all the bad stuff happened in WW2. They only last about 15 minutes, anyway. <br /> <br />All this eventually segues into several minutes of marching. This might bore the viewer; it does seem to go onand on. <br /> <br />Ms. Riefenstahl has said that she was forced to direct the music herself; the marches (and the music) were all out of sychronization, so, at her hands, the music alternately speeds up and slows down to the marching. If you watch these sequences with this in mind, and pay attention to the music--you'll find the marching not at all boring, and short-lived, even. <br /> <br />All this pageantry ends with a short speech by Hess--\\"Hitler is Germany!\\", etc. It's a rousing finale. <br /> <br />I was utterly absorbed by this movie, and have seen it three times. Highly recommended!
0451196716|4.0|This is one of King's earlier novels and in fact was first published under the pen name Richard Bachman.  In the version of The Long Walk I read there was also a chapter before the main story where Stephen King tells of the importance of being Bachman.  Like many of King's novels written in the first few decades of his career, (this was published 1979) King's ability to get the reader inside the mind of teenagers (in this case Garraty) who we follow the story looking through their eyes in a third person way is second to none.  Christine, It and Carrie are other masterpiece novel examples of where he has done this.<br /><br />The Long Walk is the story of one hundred teenage boys who have won the chance to partake in The Long Walk.  This event is a last man standing walk where they follow a designated route across the USA and if the participant slows to under four miles an hour they are given a warning. Falling asleep, injuries, sickness, dehydration, warn out shoes or any other excuse are not acceptable.  After three warnings you get shot.  The winner gets to have anything they desire for the rest of their life.  The other competitors get to find out if there's an afterlife.<br /><br />King never says if this is set in the future or a parallel universe, the reader just has to accept that America condones this event, the public would turn up in droves to watch it and competitors would readily sign up for it, knowing they in all likelihood will get shot. The winner was I thought just a little bit predictable and is the only reason I drop this great book one star in rating.  Any fan of a great read though has to check out The Long Walk.
B00064MW6K|3.0|Well,  perhaps that would have added to the film?  Of course it would have.  Sharon Stone is superb as the ever-present,  villian who is a true Looker.  Her need to be forever young,  although not a new plot line,  is played gloriously by Stone. Stone is great within this mediocre collection of scenes.  She truly pulls off the impossible.  Stone's make-up is flawless and her intense \\"eyeity\\" are compelling and truly create the flame within a sinking ship.  Three cheers for Stone.  This film is worth it's place in your library,  if only for Stone.

You'll remmember....  well,  some of you will.  This film is a campy delight.  It reminds us,  perhaps in a depressive way,  that we are loved for who we are,  in the end, at least.  A pop cameo by Naomi Campbell and Robin Williams,  just junkyard fodder.  Stockard Channing should have been nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance here.  Her delivery of this NON-COMEDIC character is perfection.  Just shows that motion pictures,  like humans,  don't deserve to be overtly classified.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|So why buy this copy insted of the normal one, without the extra stuff and the book? <br /> <br />Well if you arnt a big fan of Sin City like I am then you probably shouldnt buy this copy, but if you are... I garantee you joy, for hours! <br /> <br />The extra stuff gives you a great view over the making of Sin City, everything from the cars to the costumes. <br />And the comic book is a bit small. Way smaller then the original size but its still great. <br />so that doesnt stop me from giving this produkt 5stars. <br /> <br />If you like Sin City, havnt read the comics yet THEN this produkt will probably be the best purchase ever.
B0000700KL|5.0|I was late getting a DVD player. But there was no question as to which DVD on my \\"wish list\\" was going to get purchased and watched first. Baraka totally blew me away when I watched it in a theater. The DVD lacks the impact of hugeness that a theatrical viewing offers. But the music doesn't have to suffer one iotta in a home theater setting. And the music is my favorite part. Sometimes, like right now, I will put it on and go about my other activities without watching it at all. I have seen it often enough to see the visuals in my mind just by hearing that magnificent soundtrack.<br /><br />As a father, I enjoy Baraka for the window it introduces to my family on a wider world. Often it is a disturbing world, at risk of being lost or destroyed by \\"progress\\" and necessity. It contains stunning natural beauty of course. And man's contribution is often horrible, though not always. I wonder, though, fourteen years after its creation, if Baraka has captured whole segments of a world that now no longer exists. How much has already been lost?<br /><br />Baraka is a protest film. A naturalist's causa belli statement. A rebuke levelled at our modern fast-paced world which doesn't consider enough the cost of living. The things we squander and destroy and exploit in our current need. Future generations lose because we do not work together to save the unique and beautiful today. All of this I get from Baraka, and the makers do not utter a single word.<br /><br />My only gripe with this \\"silent\\" documentary (as in, no voice overs at all) is that it isn't long enough. I wish it were at least a full three hours instead of under two.
0823023494|5.0|I got a chance to peruse a pre-release copy of this book and I really liked what I saw. <br />Tom is a former Disney animator and does a great job of breaking down the elements of good character design. What I really like about his book is that it isn't merely a \\"How to draw like me\\" book. He teaches principles that anybody can put to use in their own style. <br />Not only did he ask Rob Corley to write a chapter (his business partner), but he asked several guest artists to submit their interpretations of the same character. Among the guests are Peter deSeve, Mark Henn, Bill Amend and Jack Davis... yes, the Jack Davis. A very diverse collection of styles, yet with one thing in common: they create excellent designs brimming with personality and attitude. <br />Tom's point in the book is that good character design, regardless of style, comes down to clarity, appeal and knowing your character inside and out. <br />(Oh, and Glen Keane wrote the forward for some more words of inspiration!)

0553573403|5.0|This book started what is most definately the best sci-fi series I have read. I did not think anything would beat Stephen King's Dark Tower series in depth and story, but this outdoes it by a longshot. While the first three books get better with each one and glue you to the story, it does get very complicated and introduce a bit too many characters and sub-plots by book IV. But don't let that scare you. This series is worth delving into. Full of rich character developement, details, and great adventure, I can only highly recommend this book and series for those who love knights, gore, adventure, and in depth storylines that leave you needing more.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|It is interesting how many people review music based on the artist, who he is, what he wears, how he records, or who buys him.  Irrelevant.  Art is about communication.

I have listened to both their first and second album and I can't really find much to like about the first album. To me it seems a little inconsisent and overall doesn't feel like a worthy listen. But 'Room On Fire' is a different story altogether. I enjoyed this album greatly mainly due to the fact that every song flowed together nicely and all the songs sounded great. Highlights on this album have to be 'Reptilia,' '12:51,' 'You talk way too much,' 'Meet me in the bathroom' and 'The Way it is.' This album is a great starter in my opinion with all around great music and easy listening.
B0000026WD|5.0|Dangerous is definitely my very fave cd by him, and i still enjoy it to this day.  i love jam, remember the time, can't let her get away, keep the faith and dangerous.  hip hop producers today couldn't hold a candle to this cd!!  definitely great music and i still think it's his best album!! *and yes to all the michael fans, i believe thriller is also his other best album, but dangerous is my personal fave!*
B000063UR2|5.0|Legend is one of the greats. The Ultimate edition includes two versions of the movie, the U.S. theatrical version with the original theatrical score by tangerine dream, and the director's cut with an alternat score. Both are SWEET!
B00005QGAT|5.0|i love love LOVE this album!!  my fave song is burn this disco out and again, shows the talent of a young michael exploding on the disco scene!!  great album and timeless songs!!  rock with you, she's out of my life, and workin' day and night!!
0553579908|5.0|I am so happy that my friends over at penny-arcade.com reccomended this series of books. This is an incredible series and the second book continues to surprise. Keep in mind that reading GRRM is an adventure to itself. By putting each chapter into the viewpoint of whomever is narrating (good, evil or on the fence) it really gives you every perspective. <br />This book also keeps to the narrative of NO ONE IS SAFE. If you like to see your favorite hero or villian alive throughout a series, be prepared to be surprised. GRRM takes no prisoners and keeps the reality of the situation in place. I just received book #3 and can't wait to start it. <br />If you like Lord of the Rings or the Wheel of Time series you'll LOVE GRRM's Fire and Ice books. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00005QGAX|5.0|to the people who gave this album bad reviews...where were you 18 years ago???  when this album went #1 all over the world and sold 20 million copies??  before the internet, before cds *if i remember correctly* and before napster??  seriously, albums don't sell 20million+ if it was crap...and this is one of his best!!
B00005JOFO|5.0|In watching this movie I was just in \\"awe\\" of the cinematography as well as the exceptional acting by these two men. Heath Ledger portrayed a conflicted individual struggling with life and his own emotions towards Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake played a great part, comfortable, confident in his feelings. I don't believe this movie surrounds the 'gay lifestyle' so much as it portrays many facets of these two mens lives and how they tried to 'fit in'.  <br /> <br />It showed courage, love, humility, strength and perseverance. Great Movie, Great Directing and especially Great Acting. Loved the movie. <br />
0385247125|5.0|i remember when this first came out, and it still remains a fave of mine.  also, check out 'dancing the dream' (another book he wrote) and 'my family: the jacksons' by michael's mom, katherine.  this book was #1 on the NYC bestseller's list and remained in the top ten for a very long time.  once you read the book, you'll see why...this was before the court cases, the tom sneddon harrassments, the sherriff's and FBI raids, and the barrage of negative tabloid books, by former friends and colleagues.  this was during the 'bad' album and during his world tour.  all mj fans, ENJOY YOURSELF!!

0440539811|5.0|Illuminatus! Trilogy is the ultimate trip. Take a spin at it and see where it takes you! Can you endure all of its hardships and easyships, or dolphinships? Maybe when the ride is over, you'll tell your friends how cool it was and then maybe they'll be riding with you on dolphins! With its mind-blowing narrative, Illuminatus! Trilogy will show you that there's more than one perspective of thinking, and that all modes of thinking are really just one mode of thinking. But who am I to say such things? Don't hold on to any of it, for if you do, you will surely fall.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Apparently the TV show was aired out of sequence, and I can see how the story arc may have been lost.  <br />Firefly is a thoroughally enjoyable show with interesting and likeable characters, solid acting, and exceptional writing, especially within the Sci-Fi genre. It's part frontier western, part high-seas(space) adventure, part starwars (but with better dialogue). The characters all have a believable and quirky nobility, that doesn't feel forced or contrived as many of the \\"star trek\\" type. Genuinely funny as well. Created by the guy who did \\"Angel,\\" and \\"Buffy\\" I believe, and often has a similar sense of humor, but within its well crafted world, it's somehow less absurd.  <br /> <br />I saw the movie first, and maybe wish I had seen it after watching the series, so it would have been in chronological order. But since the movie had a lot of necessary character intorduction, it might have seemed awkward if I already knew the characters.
0062502182|5.0|Thia book should be read by anyone who needs a hand in following her/his dreams.
0060005696|2.0|<br />I admit, I only read the first hundred or so pages, then skimmed the rest.  As Lincoln once observed, you don't have to eat the whole egg to know it's rotten. <br /> <br />It seems to me the first half of the book is filled with strawman arguments trying to illustrate how complicated the world has become, so that Mr. Schwartz can spend the rest of the book proposing solutions.  But I doubt seriously that very many people lead quotidian lives anywhere near as complicated as the author makes out. <br /> <br />For example, one of the first examples the author gives is about how shopping has become complicated.  He relates the story of looking for a pair of jeans to replace his well-worn current pair, and of becoming paralyzed when the sales clerk asks him which jean style (e.g., low-rise, boot-cut, flair, etc.) and color (stonewashed, distressed, etc.) he'd like.   <br /> <br />At this point, the simplest thing to do would have been to say \\"I want the closest thing to what I'm wearing now.  Can you help me find that?\\"  His problem would have been solved in 30 seconds.  He would, however, have one less thing to kvetch about in the introduction. (Buried deep in the book is the admission that the author didn't actually like the imperfect fit of the old jeans he was wearing, with little regard paid to the range of new style choices which provide him more opportunity to find something better-fitting.) <br /> <br />And that's the issue with the rest of the book.  Whether it's complaining that his supermarket carries a hundred kinds of cookies, his cable TV provider has 225 stations, or that employers offer \\"too many\\" choices for employee health care plans, there's little convincing evidence that consumers are now stuck, deer-like, in store aisles trying to figure out which cookies to buy.   <br /> <br />Finally, the author relies heavily on surveys which purport to show how consumers feel life has become overly complicated and stressful, and technology is running their lives.  I'm sure that had you asked Americans the same set of questions at any point since the Industrial Revolution, you would have got the same answers.  Our lives as Americans seem generally no more or less complicated than they've ever been - we're just better at complaining about them now. <br />
B000002IOJ|5.0|Testament's third release \\"Practice what you Preach\\" is a superb metal effort that is under-appreciated and often overlooked.  The late 80's/early 90's was a great time for heavy metal.  Classic albums from Metallica, Slayer and Pantera were pushing out the hair metal crap that for some reason carried the title of metal.  It was a good time to be a fan of rock and roll.  Great new bands were starting to gain notariety.  One of these bands was the San Fransisco quintet Testament.  Putting out a number of albums in a span of a few years Testament were set on making it big.  Why they never did is a mystery to me.  This album was the follow up to arguably the  most popular and in my opinion best Testament album \\"The New Order.\\"  Perhaps this one may have been a little too rushed following the release of their masterpiece.  A few of the songs on the end could be viewed by some as filler songs but I still love them.  It seems that every thrash band has four main albums that really define them as a band.  For Metallica it was Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, And Justice for All, and Metallica (Black Album), for Megadeth it was Peace Sells, Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction and So Far So Good So What and for Testament it is The Legacy, The New Order, Practice What you Preach and The Ritual.  You wont find too many people that agree with me but Testament's work is just as impressive as the afore mentioned bands.  Testament is the lost thrash band and deserve more credit then they are given.
0812036034|5.0|So not only is this a great play by Shakespeare but it's also an easy version to read right along side the original text. No need to get out the old dictionary for those words that you stumble across trying to guess the actual meaning of because it's right there next to you. This doesn't take away from the play at all either. Speaking of the play, this is a wonderful romance that reminds us how naive people can be if they aren't exposed to all of the harsh realities of life. The lady in this play practically falls in love with the first man she lays eyes on that she hasn't grown up with! It may have something to do with the magic that her father possesses. Better yet, it has everything to do with her father and the spirits that are under his spell. After you're done with the book, try to find a live performance of this play!
0307276902|1.0|...that Oprah, and her followers, are full of crap. She saw this \\"wonderful\\" memoir and thought: \\"Hey. Thats 'new'. Thats 'fresh'. I bet a can slap my name on it and sell a million.\\" And thanks to the help of single, middle-aged women across our rapidly decaying nation, she was correct. This book is poorly written. The haphazard punctuation and such is just a clever way for James Frey to dsiguise the fact that he does not know, or care to take the time to abide by, the rules of written english. I bought a copy, first edition hardcover, cause now that the poop has hit the proverbial fan I might be able to turn it into profit. I'd like to thank the naive. I bet Oprah would too. Cheers.
0307276902|5.0|I haven't finished reading this book yet, but I have to give it five stars. Why? Anyone that makes Oprah look like an idiot is okay in my books. Why is she taking this so seriously? Must be in love with herself. People that need to be told what to read or how to live(women)are probably too stupid to read anyway. Nice to see a man outsmart that man hating, pompous windbag anyway. Look at the sales ranking of this book, James Frey is a marketing genius.
B000AP04FG|1.0|The script is terrible, but aside from that the acting by Angelina and brad is horid.  Let's see. We have to believe that these \\"model looking\\" people are assasins, that they met how they actually met, in South America at a small hotel in a momemnt where they both needed each other and that they love each other. There is zero chemistry between them and the dialogiue is horrible. Then after that big boy to swallow they are supposed to want to kill each other.. ZZZZZZZ.   I am sorry but this movie SUCKS!!. Everything about Hollywood I hate is in this film. Brad's best role was the stoner in \\"true Romance.\\" He is dull and boring to watch, and if it wasn't for his good looks he would be nowhere. Same goes for Angelina and her bad english accent.    Spare yourself, don't watch this garbage...
020161622X|5.0|This book is the perfect way for a novice programmer to become familiar with the broad concepts involved in many good programming techniques. It introduces concepts such as programming by contract, testing assumptions, testing in general, and model-view-controller architecture. I see this as an introductory text, or something to use to refresh yourself on good techniques. It really doesn't delve into detail on any given topic, so if you want to know more, you'll have to look elsewhere.<br /><br />Another good thing about this book: It's concise. The authors don't repeat themselves in their text, unlike many programming book authors. Maybe they took that from their programming practices. Don't Repeat Yourself is tip #11 in the book.<br /><br />Finally, the book offers some advice on being good at any job long-term: Keep reading, keep communicating with your users and stay involved with other like-minded professionals.<br />The one shortcoming I thought the book had was a somewhat short list of references.
0307276902|5.0|I am biased.  I read this book about 10 months ago and found it riveting from start to finish.  Soon afterward, I contacted Mr. Frey with the hope that he would endorse my own memoir, \\"Hammerhead 84.\\" And to my great surprise he did just that.  (His blurb appears on the back cover.)  <br /> <br />Now that we're all aware that much of what he wrote was fabrication, I am torn.  On the one hand, I remain grateful to James for his kindness and generosity.  And I still appreciate the great story he wrote.  But on the other hand I hold strongly to the value that a memoir remain truthful.  It must be the author's personal truth, and it must be THE truth.   <br /> <br />I hold James and Random House accountable for the mistruths.  Public embarrassment is their punishment.  Hopefully, the word \\"memoir\\" will regain its kinship with truth.  But now there are lawyers and feigned victims out there trying to turn a profit out of the situation.  That is equally reprehensible, and absurd.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Yet another great show by Joss Whedon. This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I can't understand why it was canceled after its first season. If you are fans of Joss' Buffy and Angel you will surely enjoy Firefly.

0446677450|3.0|This well written book comes across as easy to understand. Though the existance of the \\"rich dad\\" in the book may be merely proverbial, it serves as a nice foil to Robert's conventional thinking dad. Broadly speaking, the book should be divided into 2 parts:    Part1: Lessons I learnt from my rich vs my poor dad.  Part2: How I did it.    Part 1: (4 of 5 stars)    Here are some useful points summarized from the book.    1. Being rich is a state of mind subject to what your needs are.    Rich dad talks about being broke yet saying to himself that he didn't do \\"x\\",  because that was not what rich people did. Poor dad earned a lot of money yet was constantly in debt. Essentially its all about sufficiency. A wealthy person may feel trapped by having to maintain a lavish lifestyle and not achieve financial freedom. Good point.    2. What is an asset and a liability.    What doesn't generate an income is a liability. This includes your home. Theoretically money tied up in a home or car could be generating more money if invested elsewhere.     3. The rich don't work for money.    Put it simply, explore investment opportunities that give you freedom to sustain your lifestyle (and eventually, your liabilities) outside your job.    Part 2: (1 of 5 stars)    Here's where the agenda comes in. Robert talks of his investments, chief of which are in Real Estate. From my possibly flawed perspective I'd have to conclude that he's either a genius, extremely lucky or guilty of lying.    1. Real Estate Guru?    Though the gains he described are possible, it amazes me that an experienced investor like himself does not mention the one thorn in an investor's side: liquidity. Property, unlike stocks or bonds, cannot be liquidated piecemeal, and Robert glosses over having to \\"wear\\" his investments (not to mention his mortgages) for extended periods until a buyer was found.    Robert mentions a $45k house he bought in Portland which he sold a year later for $95k \\"after the Real estate markethad picked up\\". The purchase was not pinned down to any foresight about the market. Calling the turn on the market sounds far riskier than the lifestyle expounded by \\"poor Dad\\". More accurately, if the property was acquired at $45k and he feels was worth $65k,wisdom would dictate that he should liquidate right away.     Holding the property as an investment would imply that he had a point of view about the market to call the turn. By all accounts, it sounds like he had no POV about the real estate market in Portland to have expected the market to pick up. Hence he got lucky on the additional $30k, which could well have gone the other way.    2. On being \\"Gung Ho\\"    If the whole point was about taking the plunge into an investment opportunity, fair enough. By empowering individuals to risk big reeks of self-help language. Again, inherently dangerous. The whole Texan spiel about going big and losing big does a disservice to Texans in general.    Robert, however, makes the point of saying that he does not recommend anyone doing what he did. But, the array of products he offers, notably his expensive CASHFLOW game, certainly hints at an agenda.    In Summary, explore opportunities which allow you to wean your liabilities off your salary into your investments. This can come in forms such as managed accounts, funds, trusts, even real estate. That's the real value of the book. Let the lemmings attend the courses and buy the game.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A gun-slinging Western set in the far reaches of the galaxy, what's not to love? This movie has just about everything: action, humor, cool spaceships, and hot women that kick butt!

0307276902|1.0|This book reminds me of some particularly gruesome c-rations I remember choking down. When I complained about how vile they were, the Gunny asked me why I ate them if they were so bad. \\"Well, they're chow\\" I replied.  <br />Well, this was \\"Million Pieces of Lies\\" book and it wasn't supposed to be this bad. Needing a plot to tie it all together, I think he borrowed heavily on Eddie Little's book as the skeleton to hang this offal on. And it is offal -- or something that sounds like it.  <br /> <br />A generous review: take this book as a long character exposition piece, with a middling storyline around it. The book gives some foundation to Little's book. Frey has his foibles and faults as an author, but when you read a Eddie Little book, you can see his talent. <br />  <br />Now, what I really think: Gadzooks, does this book suck! Where to begin? The main plot: leaves so much to be desired, is quite frankly interrupted by the repetitious use of the word \\"and\\" and (I think this because it was mentioned about 4,353 times in the book).  <br /> <br />The under-developed characters broken down to bubble-gum reading, without page turning crescendo of action and risk.  <br /> <br />One last point: The editing is done HORRIBLY (excuse me, I don't believe it was edited) and just reading it left me in Disgust and I felt I was robbed of my money when I brought this. Dont buy this novel.The book is pompous, boring (excruciatingly so), arrogant and waaay too snidely intellectually. Any good editor would have taken a red pen to this mess and fixed it; but, I suppose Frey doesn't  carry to much weight in the publishing world. What we're witnessing here, I believe, is a self-destruction of mass proportions. Seeing him photographed in on the back cover of the book is nauseating. Personally, when I read for entertainment, I don't want someone in my face with their lying agendas, especially when they are so condescendingly written.  <br />I believe it's time for Frey to fade into the sunset.Unfortunately, the writing swings from pseudo-philosophic to sophomoric. NOTE TO EDITORS: Someone please help this guy! <br />Don't buy this book. Don't Read this book. This is a story that Frey stole from a real book that was fiction. The Title of the real book is \\"Another Day in Paradise\\", written by Eddie Little. Frey was living in LA, in 1998, and began reading his \\"Outlaw LA\\" column, and then stole his book.  There is nothing more disgraceful for a writer to do than to steal ideas from other writers.  <br /> <br />He is also guilty of building unnecessary background and back stories for characters who only make a passing appearance and who don't even really even require names. Mr Frey appears to want to show off the many different ways there are to identify his characters but does not seem to realise that it makes for very uninspiring and even poor quality writing. A high school student would do better.  <br /> <br /> <br />Although obviously a very proud (and right-wing) American, it is increasingly obvious that Frey is an Anglophile and he continues to make much of the small differences between the English and Americans but surreptitiously seems to be stating the American way (pronunciation, style, etc) is the better. He often explains the English pronunciation and uses italics to emphasise the difference on a regular basis.   <br /> <br />The characters are stereotypes and are shallowly drawn. It is also the first book that I have read that I have regularly thought throughout that the Reader's Digest Condensed edition would be a much superior book.  <br /> <br />This is one book that is in desperate need of an editor, one who wouldn't be doing his or her job if he or she failed to remove at least 100 pages. <br /> <br />
B00005JOQ9|1.0|All the past writers and directors of the great classic horror movies should team up and sue this Roth character for plagerism.  Roth just took select features from past movies and tried to stitch them together to create something original but instead produced a hideous mockery of the past greats in what proved to be an hour and half long cerebral equivlent of a really bad case of fatulence.  Too bad there is no equivlent of Beano to help Roth with his recurrent ailment.
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|I was flipping through the holiday music bin, looking for a Neil Diamond Christmas CD for my Mother - when I came across the Jethro Tull Christmas Album.  I almost put it back, thinking, \\"Hmmm, Aqualung meets Rudolf?\\" - how could this possibly work. <br /> <br />I always liked Jethro Tull, even if there were only 2 of their CDs in my collection - and even if it had been years since I'd heard anything current from the band.  There was a sticker on the case, and I read the review from Rolling Stone, \\"One of the most satisfying Tull releases in 25 years!\\" along with the 4 stars that \\"All Music Guide\\" gave it. <br /> <br />Not knowing what to expect, I took a chance and bought it. <br /> <br />WOW!  What a great CD!  It's not often that an unexpected gem comes my way.  I am usually disappointed when I take a risk (which is why I don't do it very often).  But this was a real winner. <br /> <br />The distinctive vocals and flute punctuations easily identify it as a Jethro Tull release.  And I agree with previous reviews that suggest the CD doesn't necessarily need to be put away with the Christmas tree.  It can stay with the other year-round CDs. <br /> <br />Thank you, Ian and troupe, for giving me a Christmas CD that's different and entertaining:  My salvation from the same ol' same ol' re-mixed, re-covered stuff I hear every year.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|This is a soundtrack to bring back all of the emotion from the movie. Gustavo Santaolalla created a simple melody that captures the emotions of the love, the hope, and the despair, as well as the sense of the landscape. All of the songs are from the movie - I listened for them as I saw the movie a second time. This time around has put another layer of emotion on the songs: 'King of the Road' reminding me of Jack's 14 hour drives to see Ennis, singing the song on the way; 'It's So Easy' becomes bittersweet, as the hopeful nature of the song rings false (although if I were to eliminate a song from this collection, this would be it). You can't beat the performances of Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris. Like the movie, it's beautiful misery.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Well, this isn't it. Every track is one uninspired basic house beat after the next. Boring doesn't even begin to describe it. I'm all for reinvention, but this is reissue. Don't waste your time.
B000002OR4|5.0|John Williams at his finest, showing he has what it takes to compose classical music, and pieces to suit the mood of the scene.  No bombast like in Star Wars, Indiana Jones etc.  Serious music for a serious movie.  Highly recommended.
B000005H7D|5.0|I cannot agree more with these dead-on reviews, this is a masterpiece. Every song is enjoyable, though the title track is the best...Coltrane's intensity here is stunning! Of course, there's also some fine double-bowed bass on Moment's Notice, more good sax playing (Biiiiiiig surprise) from Locomotion, and a great ballad in I'm Old Fashioned. My second-favorite, though, has got to be Lazy Bird, surpisingly uptempo considering its title. (Oh well, not complaining of course). Buy this!
B00000ADG2|4.0|This CD never gets old.  Lauryn was in rare form and seemingly at the peak of her creativity.  I don't know what happened but I'm waiting for the genius of songwriting ability to return.  Though I've never thought much of her as \\"Live\\" performer, she definitely is the bomb in the studio.  Great CD.  Highly recommend.
B000002AP1|5.0|and really not in any of the Stooges albums. I think this album jams, it's raw, it's kaotic, it's rebellious, violent, and very entertaining, as long as you're not in the ring with him when he feels like cutting a few things. Guitar works on all the numbers, Search and Destroy, Gimme Danger, the next number is dedicated to all the women out there that like to give us men a hard time Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell. Penetration, get the lube, Raw Power, just like sweaty war wounds and an aggrivated guitar riff. I Need Somebody, yeh man we all do, but not a corrupt business deal. Shake Appeal and of course Death Trip, when it's all over you know you're pretty much screwed, but hey, at least enjoy it. It's a shame the Jean Genie doesn't get a lot of airplay, at least where I live. It's almost like underground music, and the first time I heard Fun House, I had to run out and get the first album, and now this. I'm sure glad I stumbled on this, but not cut myself on this. This is worth the buy, grab it before it's all gone.
B00005JLF5|5.0|I really love the series and the 1st season was fabulous! A GREAT start to a FABULOUS show, consisting of many revolutionary and original characters. However, does anyone know why the price suddenly changed from $116 to $60. Is this a different edition? I am just curious because I have bought almost the whole series at the $116 price, yet know it is almost half the price.
B000002U9W|4.0|This is not your usual Pink Floydish aquire taste, I so reckon, dear Watson, so cleverly. For you people who thought Syd was very British sounding, get a load of this album. The title track is beyond this world, and almost to my best of knowledge, should have been a sound bit for any Monty Python performance, or maybe even Peter Seller, who knows. It's very clever and it works, with the brass on this track Atom Heart Mother, which Pink Floyd actually thought was repulsive after doing, it has an interesting feel, yet so remorse, even the names of the suites in this song: Father Shout, Breast Milky, Mother Fore, Funky Dung, Mind Your Throats Please, and Remergence, just a laugh in-a-half. Now the next song 'If', now we're getting back to Floyd standards again, almost good enough to have been paired up with Granchester Meadows from the previous album. Then we get to Richard Wright's 'Summer '68', good effort, but leave the talents to ol' Gilmore and Waters, but you can still help by singing and playing the keys. Next we go to 'Fat Old Sun', he's really starting to find his level, and it works from here and then on. Last but not least, the famous 'Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast', well maybe not so, clever enough, but no real magic here, as a matter of fact, this number kind-of sucks. But anyways, if you like different sounding stuff, or if you like Zappa on his best behavior type stuff, this is the album to snatch by Pink Floyd, if not, just stare at the album cover and think of steak, and lots of it,or better yet, think about a 'Traditional Bedouin Wedding Feast' being served in the Sahara's for 250 guest. (Oh... by the way, you have to own this cd to understand the last part of that sentence)
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's Ride the Lightning is a great metal album and after twenty-two years, it still ranks as one of the best albums of all-time and it is one of the best albums released by Metallica. Fight Fire With Fire, Ride the Lightning, From Whom the Bell tolls and Fade to Black are the best tracks from the album. Metallica delivers with this album and it is a masterpiece. All I can say is that this album is a must for every Metallica fan. <br /> <br />Metallica is the best metal band of all-time!!
B00009W0U4|1.0|This is exploitation cinema masquerading as art.  Warning: Taking multiple showers every day for the next several decades will not rid you of the effects of having seen this film.  I believe that those who rate it highly are both depraved and gullible.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica is easily one of the best metal bands of all-time. Arguments can be made for Metallica, Black Sabbath and Judas Priest as the best metal bands of all time.  Metallica is the best metal band of all-time.  Masters of Puppets represents what heavy metal is supposed to be all about.  Ride the Lightning, the Black Album and Master Puppets are the best metal albums of all-time.  Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction is a great metal album and so is Skid Row's Slave to the Grind and both albums were influenced by Metallica and Black Sabbath.  Master Puppets, Leper Messiah and Damage, Inc are three of the best songs on the Master of Puppets album.  Metallica delivers speed, thrash and heavy metal on Master of Puppets and this album is the best metal album of all-time.  Metallica is legendary. <br /> <br />Here are my ten favorite Metallica songs: <br /> <br />1. Enter Sandman <br />2. For Whom The Bell Tolls <br />3. Master of Puppets <br />4. Nothing Else Matters <br />5. Until it Sleeps <br />6. One <br />7. The Unforgiven <br />8. Fade to Black <br />9. Damage, Inc <br />10. Ride the Lightning. <br /> <br />Metallica's Master of Puppets is the best heavy metal album of all-time. <br />
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Ok, so the debut from Franz Ferdinand is derivative. So what.<br /><br />The cool thing is that they are derivative of good stuff. In other words, the guitars kick and snap. The drums deliver solid rock hard beats. The lead singer belts acidic lyrics about girls and partying. And they dress well.<br /><br />To be more specific, there ain't a wiff of synthesized supermarket pop here. No songs sound ready made for cheesey product placements. And on \\"Michael,\\" they do a gender bender worthy of Bowie, The Kinks or Blur. If this was the eighties, FF would be playing with The Jam. They're really that good.<br /><br />In the almost two years since it has been released, \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" has made a lasting impression on me. The hooks in the likes of \\"This Fire,\\" \\"Take Me Out,\\" and the seductive snottiness of \\"Jacqueline\\" (\\"that's why we only work when, when we need the money!\\") just won't let go. And since the second album is a major step up from this disc, methinks FF may just have a career beyond the snazzy outfits.
B00001IVOF|5.0|this album came out in 1996 when i was just 9 years old,i copped it when i was 15,it was the first mobb deep album that i copped,and that's what i used to play when i was on my way to high school,then it got stolen,and this was the enhanced version that got stolen,in the enhanced version they have videos and there's a code that u have to enter to to unlock a very hot song called in the long run,that song is a diss toward to keith murray,i love the production in this album it's so dark and scary,but also one of the most underrated slept-on albums,and in the booklet u see mad kilo's of cocaine on the table with mobb's crew and mad dough,but then when i bought it again it wasn't there,i was so mad i was like what the hell but then they let 50 and them with the money machine and guns,and its sad that they joined g-unit and i was mad because i was fans of mobb deep until they joined g-unit,anyways this album is recommended for the production,that real east coast hip hop,that dunn language,for fans of the old mobb deep,standout tracks are animal instinct,drop a gem on em (a 2pac diss)worth checking out,and i give them and cnn credit because they were the only ones from the east coast particurly my state ny for responding back to the west coast,bloodsport,extortion (with method man),more trife life (havoc solo talking about the dangers of seeing a girl),man down with big noyd,can't get enough of it (my favorite track on the album),nighttime vultures,god pt.3,get dealt with(my 2nd favorite track),the title track,and still shinin (MY 3rd favorite)
0833509454|4.0|I agree that this story definately did lose focus and shift too far astray at many points, but the important thing for me when reading an entertainment oriented book is:  was it a page turner?  Did it pull me in quickly and make me not want to put it down?  The anwer is definately yes.  Stephen King has the gift.   <br /> <br />It's basically all about childhood fears and how they affect you later in life - repressed memories, and adults with 20 year old skeleton's in their closets.  A great read.
0446577383|2.0|All political stances aside this novel while not horrible is somewhat trite and shallow. It's really not worth passing up other good books to read it.  If you're trapped on a 16 hour flight with nothing else to read, it can provide some light entertainment but I wouldn't pick it out of thousands of others if your able. Personally, I listened to the unabridged audio on both legs of an 8-hour trip and I will admit it was somewhat better then 14 or so hours of top-40 music. <br /> <br />In case you're wondering, it comes fully loaded with all the stereotypical stuff you find in every other run-of-the-mill political suspense thriller: <br /> <br />-John Doe with dark government past <br />-Corrupt intelligence leaders with bumbling cronies involved in a cover up/conspiracy <br />-Downtrodden low-level law enforcement type who needs redemption and a love interest <br />-Computer guru who can hack into any high-security database from his laptop in a few minutes <br />-\\"Tension\\" filled moments as the bad guy's sudden return surprises the good guys who must quickly cover their tracks and sneak out. <br />- Shootouts in old isolated abandoned facilities with automatic weapons and very inept, highly-trained bad buys <br />-Complete overreaction and ignorance by all powerful good-guy leaders <br /> <br />You can pretty much fill in the holes up to and including the countdown to solve the case before untold masses are killed and the final scenes were the apathetic leaders all get their comeuppance- &lt;yawn>.   <br /> <br />Although there are a few new spins sprinkled in here and there, the utter stretch required to even remotely believe the events in the book pretty much offset these.  I mean come on, our answer to a terrorist act is to nuke a major city in the country harboring the group who \\"claims\\" responsibility via a phone call - uh yeah O.K. I can see that. <br /> <br />I couldn't care less if people see this as liberal propaganda or not its just worn-out fiction.  If you are addicted to this genre and simply love anything to do with \\"secret\\" government agencies, plots to do evil and such then this will be right up your alley.  If you've read some Flynn, Grisham, Coontz, DeMille, Ludlum, Patterson et al. and are looking for something fresh - forget it.   <br />
B00005JNJV|4.0|Christian Bale was perfect for this role, and Liam Neilson was terrific as always.  I could have done without Katie Holmes cross eyed deformed face, but she didn't ruin the movie.  The exotic background of bruce wayne and the story which is more character driven than it's predecessors fully emerse you in this movie.  The cinematography is good and it's well directed and edited.  If only the others were done this way...the right way.

B000274THQ|5.0|There have been many comments about this film, most positive. I agree with the positives. As a film, it is funny, warm and enjoyable. It is also well done. But there's more. <br /> <br />The people who panned the film because it showed East Germany in a good light missed the point. This is a film about illusions: those of the DDR and its leaders and citizens; those of the mother after her husband leaves and she cannot follow; those of the son to protect his mother; those of the film-maker friend and his involvement in the deception; those of the makers of this film in recreating East Berlin several years before and flying Lenin down the street; those of the daughter dropping out of college to sell burgers; those of the first German cosmonaut now driving a taxi for a living; perhaps even those of us in the West and our illusion of consumption-based happiness and fulfillment. <br /> <br />This is a far deeper look at much more that just what was wrong with East Germany, or a mother-son relationship. It has depths that reward multiple viewings. It forces us to ask about whether we are perceiving reality or whether we are part of a different mass-illusion. If you think it lets the DDR off the hook, watch it again. The film basically accuses the DDR of being a huge illusion foisted on a subject people, a total denial of reality. If you think that the film is saying that the DDR was a good thing, wake up and look at the film more closely. <br /> <br />Enjoyable on many levels and recommended for all sorts of good reasons.
B0000025T6|4.0|After the commercial success of \\"The River\\" you might have expected Bruce to continue to reach for the highest level of rock stardom, which he did later achieve with the \\"Born In The USA\\" album. But between those two records was the sparse, acoustic and most definitely non-commercial \\"Nebraska\\".  <br /> <br />Gone were Springsteen's trademark roaring vocals. Instead he sang in a very understated manner, almost reaching a whisper at times. Also the E-Street Band didn't play on this record. It was only Bruce with his harmonica and acoustic guitar.  <br /> <br />The songs paint a stark, lonely, sometimes dangerous portrait of the American landscape. A country of have and have nots, with the most desperate and tormented being driven to extreme acts of violence and even murder.  <br /> <br />Most of the songs are quite well written. One of the standouts is \\"State Trooper\\", which memorably evokes the emotions and mental state of a worn out late night driver with something to hide. I also like \\"Reason To Believe\\" which expresses how people somehow find the will to keep on living, despite all the disappointment and misery, due to faith, hope and love - three central principles of the Springsteen ethos. <br /> <br />But what prevents this record from ranking up there with Bruce's very best is that there is just not enough happening musically. Don't get me wrong. I am actually a big fan of acoustic musicians such as Woody Guthrie and Robert Johnson. Bluegrass is my favorite traditional music form. But the best acoustic music manages to contain enough melody and rhythm to emotionally compel the listener. Musically this album's best cut is \\"Atlantic City\\" with it's driving and memorable sound. But most of the other songs just don't \\"stick with me\\" enough to place this one up there with Bruce's very best.  <br /> <br />Still \\"Nebraska\\" is a good record and well worth owning.
B0000057C5|5.0|One of the most controversial bands on either side of the pond is this industrial metal band from Germany,everything from The infamous Columbine shooting to their live shows and also the fact that unlike many European bands that make it big in the U.S normally lose the native tongue just to appeal to a broader audience. Rammstein has been pretty much unconventional in their approach since making it big with Du Hast, a dance- metal vibe about non comformity towards marriage, Du Hast is You Have not you hate. This band has a combination of strong dueling power  chords, crunchy bass, strong percussions, melo=growling German vocals that make you feel a strong,angry and strange man is delivering such a powerful performance. And included too is the keyboard player, which many metal bands tried after using stronger, melodic sound without appearing to be a nu=metal band. He adds alot of dark emotion to the songs themselves such in the song Klavier(Piano) where it gives me the feel of a dark and cold place. One of the most popular songs in this album is Engel(Angel), a great contrived song, an angry and hostile male song with soothing female vocals that ends cutting the beauty and turning it back to anger. My favorite thing about this album is the fact that it varies its emotional feel constantly from humorous to wacky to violent and dark and all in one song. For me the songs that stood out were Sehnsucht, Engel, Tier, Du Hast, Klavier, Alter Mann, Eifersucht and Kuss Mich and even the only English song, a Depeche Mode cover Stripped. Overall, an A+ album that should be a part in anyones collection.
0307276902|4.0|I had been planning on reading A Million Little Pieces for a few months now.  The controversy about how many lies are in the book was what made me go out and get my hands on it and read it right away.  I had heard all the hype for the book; trust me.  I'm not a huge fan of \\"drug/rehab\\" books.  I don't enjoy reading about the highs that the drugs gave the author, it just seems like total nonsense to me.  Thankfully, James Frey's memoir is not filled with drugged-out mindtrips, it is completely about his journey through rehab, and the people he meets there, and his own personal journey to get his life back together.<br /><br />The characters in the book are amazing.  In fact, it's hard to believe they are real (and who knows, maybe they aren't).  The friends that James meets, especially Leonard, are amazing characters that you feel for and root for.  Frey's love interest, Lilly, is another great character from the book.  I guess I've just led a rather privileged lifestyle, because it is really tough for me to hear stories like the ones that are told in the book and imagining them happening in the real world.  It's just another reminder of how sheltered I and many others really are.<br /><br />The most powerful moments of the book occur in the last 100 pages or so, when James finally starts coming around and showing his emotion to his family, friends, etc.  I never cried, but I came close, and I thinkt that if the book had been written in a different, more coherent style, I would have cried my eyes out.  The writing style takes a little while to get used to.  No quotation marks at all, no paragraph indentations, no real grammar.  Overall, the style fits in with the book, though, and adds another element that really puts you inside the head of James as he goes through this experience.<br /><br />Whether you believe what you are reading or not, this book is definitely worth your time.
076113719X|5.0|I buy this calendar every year because it does show \\"who goes where and when\\".  Love the breakdown for each person (no color coding needed).  Takes a little getting used to the different visual format, but not too difficult.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|This DVD pack was amazing, it features some really ground breaking special features, like the green screen version of the whole movie and so on. <br /> <br />The DVD set features 2, yes 2 versions of the movie and the complete \\"hard goodbye\\" comic book! The movie also has 2 commentaries featuring Frank miller, Bruce Willis and yes Quentin Tarantino himself! <br /> <br />This is a really unique DVD box set that is a MUST for any DVD collection!!  <br />
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Very nice boxed set with some reproductions of various GBU movie posters from the '60's. The sound and picture quality on the DVD are as fine as could possibly be expected from a 35 year-old movie. The extras are mildly entertaining, but the real cool thing is watching the film with the extra 20+ minutes of edited material re-inserted. In this case, editing was a GOOD move. The added footage does very little to expand the storyline and it's very obvious why the footage was deleted in the first place. For all you GBU trivia junkies: Check out the full text of the conversation between Blondie and the 'Half Soldier'. This is the only scene I found where the re-inserted material really adds to the movie. But let's be honest - the reason The Good, the Bad & the Ugly is so great is the fact that it's three pages of dialogue spaced over a three hour movie. Ya really don't NEED the chitchat to be blown away by the film.
0060090367|5.0|This was my first book by Marian Keyes and I really enjoyed this fun and lighthearted read! It's the story of Claire (one of the Walsch sisters), and how she picks up the pieces of her life after being dumped by her husband, on the day she gives birth to their baby. And just when she's in the processs of picking almost the last of those pieces, her husband is back! Very cute and funny! If you're not in the mood for something profound or earth shattering and just need some cheering up, pick up Marian Keyes. Having said that, I am, by no means, undermining this book, because it takes great talent to write such a book about a person and her life and keep the reader engrossed! Watermelon will have you totally engrossed and turning the pages till the end! For a author with similar talent, try Sophie Kinsella or even Emily Giffin!
0553277472|2.0|Book reviews should do two things: one is to examine the readability of a work and the other is to comment on its content. `Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' is certainly readable though it can be rather slow going. Really slow going. Sometimes I found it hard to push through to the end of the paragraph. The conversations feel contrived and artificial. There is a plodding sensation to the story that never quite goes away.<br /><br />As for content I'll admit to being unimpressed. This is old stuff now. Authors like Wayne Dyer and Depak Chopra have been making tons of money off this stuff for years. The pseudo-scientific \\"What the Bleep Do We Know\\" follows right in line. As an example, Pirsig gives a very poor argument for the subjectivity of natural law. Nature and natural law exist only in the mind of the individual, he explains badly to his son. There is no objective reality - only that which you make in your mind. His son doesn't get it and only the most accepting reader will.<br /><br />My guess is that the book touched so many lives because of the newness of the material to Western minds thirty years ago. There are much better books now on both Occidental and Oriental philosophy that make a whole lot more sense.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|A friend gave me this CD for Christmas. It is a part of his \\"get this guy out of the 60s\\" campaign, and so far so good. I have read several of the \\"Illinoise\\" customer reviews, and can say with some conviction that this review is a supplement, sometimes (hopefully) a complement.....but never a replacement. My friend (\\"Sheesh John, there's more to music than Brian Wilson\\") encouraged me by saying that \\"Illinoise\\" has a Pet Sounds feel.<br />Now, it has to be said that whenever I hear music I like, I hear some Pet Sounds in it. So, that aside, 3 influences to speak of are The High Llamas, Van Dyke Parks, and - sumptuously on a couple of tracks - Paul Simon.<br />Yet for all that, the album (see, I told you I was stuck in the 60s) doesn't sound derivative in any way. This man can write, he can arrange and he can sing.<br />I came to Amazon not to write a review, but to see what othe Sufjan Stevens I could buy. So now it's down with the pen - metaphorically of course - and out with the Mastercard.<br />Thanks Sufjan Stevens.
1577311523|2.0|\\"When you become identified more with the timeless inner body than with the outer body...you do not accumulate time...in the cells of your body. The accumulation of time...greatly impairs the cell's capacity for renewal. Is there any scientific evidence for this? Try it out and you will be the evidence.\\" E. Tolle, The Power of Now<br /><br />If this passage appeals to you then you'll enjoy the book. If you are familiar with the works of Wayne Dyer or Depak Chopra then you won't find much new material here but you might prefer Tolle's delivery. The writing is adequate with a rather contrived, I think, sense of mystery. Like all of the New Age writers Tolle pulls indiscriminately from dozen of teachers to weave his particular version of enlightenment. Some of his ideas are just plain goofy but most are harmless. If you can pick through the weeds you might find something of use here.
B00005JSGK|5.0|My dad is a huge fan of John Wayne and he hadn't seen this movie before.  We watched it together and it was great!!!  The scenery was great, seeing the animals was awesome.  My dad especially enjoyed the rhino and monkey capture.  I highly recommend this movie for not only John Wayne fans, but introduce it to the younger generation.  The family my sister is living with has two young teens that also enjoyed the movie.
B00006L83N|5.0|I have been a fan of Dream Theater since 1992 and I wondered, How come there aren't any ohter bands playing prog. I mean we had Rush,Yes,ELP,Genesis. I just was not informed. I saw this album and it was labeled Prog-metal so I figured I would like it. Well, it turned out, This album freaked me out! It starts out with a guitar riff that is right in your face. The vocals are not girly like Dream Theater can be(not downing Theater,though. Their melodic and really strong and ballsy. If you like prog metal this album will not dissappoint you. If I had to pick \\"THE BEST PROG/METAL ALBUM EVER!\\" It would be this one.Trust me,It will grab a hold of you like nothing else. LONG LIVE PROG!!
0439679958|2.0|There's very little in the core story of _Raven's Gate_ that's original. Horowitz borrows heavily both from older sci-fi/fantasy/horror works (Lovecraft and Stephen King, most noticeably) and mythology to create a world-within-a-world that in no way feels either new or particularly scary. If you read enough in the previously mentioned genres, you will have seen nearly all of these concepts used at least once elsewhere, and probably used better. And if you have seen them, then this story becomes utterly predictable. <br /> <br />Of course the entire village of Lesser Malling is part of the conspiracy and of course Matt can't get out without a special talisman. I can't recall how many horror books and movies have utilized that concept. We know Matt has some sort of special power from the onset so nothing about him is a surprise. The big climax of the book felt like a rehash of Lovecraft, only with a nuclear meltdown. And the way it was wrapped up really seemed far too contrived, convenient. <br /> <br />I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the reporter, Richard, seemed like something straight out of Stephen King's _Salem's Lot_, but less believable. His sudden attachment to Matt was jarring in the face of all his \\"just a story\\" talk from before. His surviving at all defies believability and it's obvious that he's only there because he'll be serving the function in the next book of an adult who can do things/get around obstacles that Matt can't, as well as providing a place for Matt to stay so the government can't get hold of him again. It's a useful purpose, true, but one that another adult should've been found for so Richard maintained his believability as a character. <br /> <br />The narration of the story flows well enough but it gets jarring whenever a point of view is suddenly switched mid-paragraph for no apparent reason. There are some pretty decent moments (Matt's last two escapes) where a good amount of tension is built up, and that at least stoppedme from giving it one star, but it's not enough to make up for the sheer predictability of the whole story. From the minute Mrs. Deverill shows up, it's so very easy to guess exactly what's going to happen pages before it ever does, and that just makes for a dull read. <br /> <br />This looks to be a five book series, so hopefully the next one will have less of a derivative, rough draft feel to it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Who in their right mind killed this series? Who ever it was should be dragged out into the street and shot with a photon cannon! This has a very powerful story, and enough humor and lighter sides to make it fun to watch over and over. Dont forget to pick up the Serenity movie to cap off the series.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South (2004) has been categorised as the next Pride and Prejudice (1995).  A few similarities are there but North and South is distinctly more satisfying in its conclusion.  Richard Armitage's Thornton has the same unforgettable presence and appeal as Colin Firth's Darcy. No one with a heart can fail to be stirred by the scene where Thornton says, \\"Look back at me.\\" and the last scene is the most romantic wish-it-will-happen-to-me scene for which any true believer would hope. <br />My recommendation: Beg, Borrow or Steal, but North and South must be seen.
0525948023|3.0|The ultimate purpose of human existence, 'your purpose,' is to bring power into the world.  The only place of power is the present moment. To set goals, one of which will undoubtedly be to get rid of anyone or anything that's tying you to negative memories from the past, most of us have the inability or rathre unwillingness of the human mind to let go of the past.  This is the way most humans life all the time.  No situation or event is ever finished. <br /> <br />Awareness if the power concealed within the present moment.  \\"Gossiping often carries an element of malicious criticism and judgment of others, and so it also strengthens the ego through the implied but imagined moral superiority that is t her whenever you apply a negative judgment to anyone.\\"  Albert Einstein was admired as almost superhuman, and his fate was to become one of the most famous people on the planet, but he \\"never identified with the image the collective mind had created of him.  He remained humble, egoless.  In fact, he spoke of 'a grotesque contradiction between what people consider to be my achievements and abilities and the reality of who I am and what I am capable of.\\" <br /> <br />The famous classic pop song, \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\"  is the song of the ego.  \\"The underlying emotion that governs all the activity of the ego is fear.\\"  Some egos know what they want and pursue their aim with grim and ruthless determination:  \\"Genghis Khan, Stalin, Hitler, to give just a few larger-than-life examples.  The energy behind their wanting, however, creates an opposing energy of equal intensity that in the end leads to their downfall.\\" <br /> <br />\\"War is a mind-set, and all action that comes out of such a mind-set will either strengthen the enemy, the perceived evil, or if the war is won will create a new enemy, a new evil equal to and often worse than the one that was defeated.\\"  Usually people are completely unaware of the roles they play.  They are those roles; some are sublte while others are blantantly obvious, except to the person playing it.  \\"Some roles are designed simply to get attention from others.  The ego thrives on others' attention, which is after all a form of psychic energy.  The ego doesn't know that the source of all energy is within you, so it seeks it outside:  recognition, praise, admiration, or just to be noticed in some way, to have its existence acknowledged.\\" <br /> <br />Unlike stress, enthusiasm has a high energy frequency and so resonates with the creative power of the univrese.  Ralph Emerson said: \\"Nothing great has ever been achieved without enthusiasm.\\"  Enthusiasm brings an enormous empowerment into what you do, so that all those who have not accessed that power would look upon your achievements in awe and may equate them with who you are.  \\"Through enthusiasm you enter into full alignment with the outgoing creative principle of the universe.\\"  Read this book to learn what your individual goal is, or should be.  Different readers will respond in different ways.

B00003CX9E|5.0|Citizen Kane, stared by and directed by Orson Welles, with as pefect of a cast as one could make for each individual role, is widely regarded by many movie historians and critics as the greatest motion picture ever made. Well how well that arguement holds up is up to each individual viewer. What is undeniable is that it was decades ahead of it's time in it's ability to tell something at the time so original and flawless.  <br /> <br />Orson Welles plays as Charles Foster Kane, and we see him from a little boy till he becomes an old cranky man. It's told brilliantly from the perspective of a reporter who's investigating the meaning of Kane's apparent last word, \\"Rosebud\\". The way this movie shifts is so non-linear that it required viewers to put pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle, but it surprisingly is never confusing in how it does it. Kane as a boy is adopted by a wealthy man, as a young man buys a news paper that he makes a mokery of, marries a President's niece, runs for office buy get's set back by a singer who can't really sing, gets obsessed by material possessions, and I still haven't begung to describe the complex life it unveils. The cast of characters do a magnificent job at surrounding him at different points in his life, along with being inteview subjects after Kane's death, but Kane is always in the forefront and his presense on screen is never topped.  <br /> <br />This film is fascinating, entertaining, and mezmorizing at every single point. After watching it many times I still don't remember where everything begins and ends, but can easily comprehend Kane's life in luxery. It's a film that must be in any true movie lovers collection.

One leaves it <br />understanding human nature a little bit better, and feeling a little more compassion <br />for one's fellow human beings. <br />

B000AMPZF8|5.0|I've been a fan of Muse for a while but just recently bought this CD. New Born is by far the best song on the album, but every song is just stunning and beautiful. If you're into rock and almost neo-classical sounds, check this out.
B00005JKED|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's all about a cop named Jake who a renegade cop named Alonzo Harris is on the intent to teach about doing the \\"right thing in a dog eat dog world of crime.\\" It is filled with blood and gore, funny jokes and scenes, lots of memorable quotes, intense shooting & fistfight scenes, and to top it all off packed to the brim with more cursing & obscenity than you can shake a middle finger at. The acting is wonderful, nearly all the characters look cool, & all in all I give this a 9.75 out of 10. If you like fighting movies or police dramas, this film is for you. Period. Given the fact I'm a wolf lover as well as a lion, tiger and jaguar lover, I loved that \\"You need to be da wolf in dis here city!\\" by Alfonzo or whatever similar thing he spoke.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|If you haven't seen the series, or only parts of it, this show is definetely a well made, accurate and entertaining which you will no doubt enjoy.  For those of you who are \\"space-buffs\\", as it were, from the earth to the moon is an excellent chronicle of the apollo program and the preceding developments.  The show goes into all the aspects of the apollo program, the politics, the creation of the lunar module, the media, and the programs place in 1960's culture.  The episode featuring the Apollo One tragedy was well done, and really captures the emotion and drama of the event.  with this series you get to see the people who made it possible and what they went through to meet Kennedy's deadline. <br /> <br />As far as DVD purchases go, this is one of the more expensive sets, but is worth it.  12 episodes, 1 hour each, plus the bonus features.  The packaging is very original and very well done.  Beacuse it is a mini-series, it is unique in that for just a short time, you are brought back to the 1960's and you can relive the eperience or experience it for the first time.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I never watched the television series Firefly, so going into this movie I knew nothing of the history.  Luckily, it was easy to follow the story.  The writer does a wonderful job of making the story accessable to newbies like me, yet I could also sense there was a lot of old plots and loose ends being tied up.  Good science fiction with a touch of the old west and some humor.  I enjoyed the movie enough that I am going to pick up to series to get all the back story I missed.
B00005B4GU|5.0|If you reached this far in the Radiohead's evolutive chain,  which is:  (Pablo Honey - The Bends - Ok Computer - Hail to the Thief - Kid A - Amnesiac)  you can now truly understand what is Radiohead.  This is as complex as their music gets.  I think this should be the last Album any fan should appreciate.  Not because it's bad (far from it) but because you will really enjoy it's beauty after climbing the whole CD WALL, upon which Amnesiac stands on the Top.  Amnesiac actually should have been released as a double CD togheter with Kid A, if you listen to both you'll notice that they complete each other.  With tracks that range from Techno (Pulk/pull revolving doors), backwards recording (Like spinning plates) and Jazz (Life in a glass house), this album it's for people with all good tastes for music.  Containing classics such as \\"Pyramid Song\\" and \\"I Might be Wrong\\", it's a must have among their sounds intusiasts.   This album is in my collection.  I hope it's in yours too.  Thanks for reading this.
0671578855|1.0|I thought that Bujold's early books -- The Warrior's Apprentice and Shards of Honor -- were appealing, but like a lot of authors who start making the big $$$$ from writing ENDLESS series, her work has gone alarmingly downhill. I don't see how this can be called science fiction with a straight face.<br /><br />Obviously the many positive reviews here (which mostly sound as if written by one person, using different psuedonyms, and undoubtedly in the employ of Ms. Bujold's publicist) demonstrate that loyal fans just want to see their favorite character(s) in similar situations over and over again, no matter how tired or lame. This phenomenon was richly explored in the many film and book adaptation of the Star Trek series -- a TV show that was actually good and ground-breaking...IN ITS DAY. However, when tired jokes and relationships are exploited to the maximum for the sole purpose of trotting out the aging tired actors for another \\"go-round\\", the whole thing became painfully embarassing. Such is the current state of the Miles Vorkosigan saga.<br /><br />Just look at the cover -- OK, I know the author doesn't design the cover. But Ms. Bujold is a very popular, famous, award-winning author and she udoubtedly has a lot of clout with the publishing house. WHY WHY WHY does the book jacket depict a man of normal height and handsome looks, dancing with a beautiful girl? This is a classic cover ripped off of any standard Harlequin romance (dear readers, just step one or two aisles over). Who the hell is it supposed to depict? It can't be Miles, because he is a 4'9\\" hunchbacked dwarf with spindley limbs. It can't be his clone brother Mark, because he is a FAT dwarf. Who is the woman? Why are they wearing clothing from approx. 19th century Europe anyhow?<br /><br />Am I the only one reading these books who realizes that the \\"so-called\\" futuristic sci fi setting is actually a loose adaptation of Tsarist Russia, right down the estates, the nobleman, emperor (tsar), etc.? Even many of the names are Russian -- Ekaterin, Ivan, Gregor -- or East European.<br /><br />I think for all her Hugos and Nebula's, Lois Bujold is nothing more than a frustrated romance writer. Maybe she is actually off writing genuine historical romances under another name! I hope so for her sake, because she is clearly bored out of her mind with the usual elements of sci fi, the spaceships, time travel, strange new worlds and all that. This book is nearly devoid of any sci fi elements whatsoever.<br /><br />I think Bujold gives it all up in the dedication, which coyly mentions by first name Jane Austen, Georgette Heyer etc. (Does anyone under 50 remember Georgette Heyer? In her day, she was a prolific and very popular writer of just this kind of whimsical period romance, where the struggle is whether a couple will get together or not -- sort of Austen-light.)<br /><br />To get back to the book jacket: I think this actually reveals the fact that neither the author nor fans have really sat down and pictured what Miles would really look like in the arms of a normal woman. You don't see a whole lot of deformed-dwarf/regular-gal hook-ups in the real world, and this is why. There are...ummm. let's just be kind and say \\"physical impediments\\" to a satisfying relationship. (To confess, at 5'6\\", I once dated a perfectly normal man who was 5'2\\" and it felt like I was molesting a 12 year old boy.) Actually dealing with this real world problem would skim a lot of charm off the series, so the author dodges it for a visit to fantasy island.<br /><br />I've wondered all along why Bujold can't imagine Miles, or Mark for that matter, hooking up with a similarly handicapped or physically challenged woman (and I don't mean an 8ft tall Wookie). I guess that's not \\"romantic\\" -- men can be shrimps (i.e., Napoleon) and rule the world...but God forbid that female protagonists be anything but pretty, pretty, pretty.<br /><br />At any rate, \\"A Civil Campaign\\" is only science fiction, if your standard is the OLD Battlestar Galatica series or maybe Lost in Space...and it's only witty or charming, if your standard is \\"Gilmore Girls\\".<br /><br />All I can say about Ms. Bujold anymore is \\"Cha CHING!\\" You go, babe! Living well is the best revenge! (But it doesn't make for good literature.)on, if your standard is the OLD Battlestar Galatica series or maybe Lost in Space...and it's only witty or charming, if your standard is \\"Gilmore Girls\\". <br /> <br />All I can say about Ms. Bujold anymore is \\"Cha CHING!\\" You go, babe!

B00012FXAE|5.0|By far the best of the Alien series, followed, in my opinion, by the original, then 3, then resurrection (I don't consider Alien vs Predator to be part of the series). <br /> <br />I especially like the drop ship sequence. <br /> <br />The only thing I'm not real fond of is the annoying character played by Bill Paxton (who should have been eaten earlier), the other characters and storyline is very good. <br /> <br />I just wish they didn't kill off that nice Cpl. Hicks and Newt for the 3rd movie.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Coldplay has always been a band that played within its limitations- not particularly great songwriters doing adequately performed okay pop music.  This is no towering independent band, just passable ear candy, good radio-in-the-car music. <br /> <br />X&Y prompts a more visceral reaction.  Just to take one example: \\"Talk\\".  \\"Referencing Kraftwerk\\"??? If you call lifting Kraftwerk's entire melody, not even modified, and slapping some sacharine lyrics on it referencing, you need to open your dictionary. This is lazy songwriter plagarism, without even a \\"thank you Rolf and Florian\\" in the liner notes. <br /> <br />Is this what new music has sunken to?  Is the blatant recycling of other people's music ceased to be plagarism and become an homage?? <br /> <br />It's probably not worth getting worked up about.  This trivial album is, after all, expendable pop music; Coldplay is making no claims to art.  It is disturbing to see people taking this stuff seriously, and not busting the band for their lazy ways, but, then, they are just a bunch of popular music tools.  I could go on about the awful lyrical material on this album, or the easy listening orchestrations, but perhaps it is better to let this turkey fade slowly from the short memories of the pop music universe.......
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Maybe I'm just too darn easy to please. When I read these reviews of people complaining about the excess of noise, the randomness, and so forth, part of me agrees with them. Yes, I do wish the last two minutes of \\"The Widow\\" were taken out. Yes, I think that these guys seem musically schizophrenic at times. But some of these same reasons are reasons that I like this album. If I have a good amount of time to just lie down and waste away in an overindulgant musical overdose, this album fits the bill.    The closest analogy I can come up with is that listening to this album is equivalent to taking a solo road trip to the middle of nowhere, but enjoying the solidarity and escapidity(eh?)  of the whole experience. And taking random turns onto random roads for no apparent reason is part of the joy of it all. I can't speak for anyone else, but I sometimes need a relief from predictable and formulaic music.    I'll concede the spaces are a little overdone, but not much. For those who already own this album, think about it - would you really be able to handle this album if all the space was taken out? I'm pretty confident that after a while it'd all become too overwhelming and overbearing, and as for myself, I'd probably go insane. This music has the richness of your grandmother's fudge. Eating the whole pan in a half hour would guarantee indigestion.    So, this album isn't for casual listening, obviously. It holds a niche within my CD collection that isn't really comparable to anything else (people making comparisons to Rush are grasping at straws - they're only similar in that they are both rooted in progressive song structures). Oh, and about that 30+ minute song everyone is talking about. It's actually a sort of suite broken up into segments.    I think Francis was a worthy purchase. But again, maybe I'm just too easy to please.

B00003CXXP|5.0|I LOVE this movie. The effects, the acting, the music, all wonderful. The plot was very well written. It has lots of actions in some scenes but the main ojection is the love David has for his mother. The way the robots are treated makes you hate to be human during most of the movie. I have a true A.I. robot cat a Necoro I named Gizmo, he learned his name just be repeating it and he knows my voice and even interacts with my \\"Orga\\" cats. Since I acquired Gizmo I have a deeper love for this movie then I ever did.
B00005NWM3|1.0|These guys suck.  It sounds like Creed only worse.  I think it's funny that the little wimpy 'cowardly lion-esque' singer from canada thinks he's tough in that video for never again where he's saying \\"kicking your a$$ would be a pleasure\\"  I laughed so hard at that line I fell out of my recliner.  I would have severe depression if I lost a fight to that nerdario.  Another little tidbit that blows my mind is that they are on Roadrunner records, which, at one point in time was known for putting out brutal metal records, that certainly isn't the case anymore (with the exception of a few, like KSE for instance). Bottomline is, this is bad soft rock with a lame attitude.  you should avoid this like black friday at wal-mart.
B000002UB3|5.0|A lot of people point to Sgt. Peppers' or the White Album as being the most indicative of the \\"late Beatles sound\\". But I would have to disagree and say that Abbey Road really nails what the Beatles were all about. They managed to cram all sorts of different sounds and genres into a 45-minute LP, which says something in itself. Everything from classic anthems like \\"Come Together\\" and \\"She's So Heavy\\", to the acid-influenced 50's style ballad \\"Oh Darling\\", to the bubble-gum pop sound and disturbing lyrics of \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", to the beautiful ballad \\"Something\\", to the goofy-yet catchy \\"Octopus's Garden\\" screams ECLECTIC. And that's just Side 1. Side 2 (or the second half of the CD if you prefer) is where things really get interesting. It starts with a finely-penned George piece, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" (Harrison was really starting to come into his own as a songwriter, rivalling Lennon and McCartney for Alpha Dog status), \\"Because\\", a haunting Lennon tune, and then several medleys in which McCartney and Lennon take turns with tunes: McCartney starts it off with the gorgeous \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", and Lennon then takes over with \\"Here Comes the Sun King\\", \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\", with McCartney wrapping up medley 1 with \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\". The second medley begins with \\"Golden Slumbers\\", a McCartney ballad, into \\"Carry That Weight\\" and finally \\"The End\\", in which McCartney, Lennon and Harrison trade off some pretty nice guitar solos before uttering the famous last words, \\"And in the End, the Love you Take is Equal to the Love you Make\\", a final restatement of their \\"All You Need is Love\\" mantra from the late-60's. The album wraps up with the typically comical \\"Her Majesty\\", a little McCartney piece making fun of the Queen of England. This is truly an album I never tire of. And while I have always enjoyed the other Beatles albums, starting with Rubber Soul, and then hitting stride with Revolver and so on, this is to me the quintessential Beatles album. A must have for fans of classic rock or music in general as it shows us a glimpse of a band that was in turmoil at the time this was recorded, and yet had never been so creative musically.me the quintessential Beatles album.

0156027321|4.0|It is a decent novel. The author builds the plot well and the story   is interesting. The author is obviously gifted in weaving a supreme blend of storytelling,characterizations,suspense and an  aura of quiet enlightnment about the human condition. He makes you think about God, purpose of life and the extraordinary spirit of man. Sometimes the details are too tedious. Overall a good book to be savored slowly..
B000001FV1|5.0|Traffic hit a new creative stride after Mason left the band following \\"Last Exit\\". Personally I am torn, because I really do like Mason's sound, but in the end I cannot deny that it helped Traffic as a group throw caution to the wind and really venture out from the world of Brit psychedelic pop-rock into rock-jazz fusion, with the addition of Reebop Kwanku-bah on drums for a more African-oriented sound (something Santana was doing too albeit in a Latinized way). One indicator of this transition is track length, which starts to take a jump up from 3-4 minutes to 6-10 minutes with \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" (the first post-Mason album) and continuing here and on Low Spark, etc. On \\"Shootout\\", we find Traffic mixing it up with slow ballads like \\"Sometimes I Feel So Uninspired\\", Jazzy instrumentals like \\"Tragic Magic\\", and two great tunes which can loosely be qualified as \\"rock\\": \\"Shootout at the Fantasy Factory\\" and the album's cornerstone, \\"Roll Right Stones\\", a 13-1/2 minute ripper where Wood and Winwood bust out their improvisational chops while Winwood shows off his incredible voice. Traffic is pretty much a footnote with most folks these days, which seems a bit strange considering the more prominent solo careers some of the musicians enjoyed afterwards, even with less creative musical material (i.e., Mason, Winwood). Part of that has to do with the more keyboard-brass driven sound of the band rather than the standard guitar-dominated sound of other contemporary rock-outfits: but the guitar as a driving element probably would have hindered their fusion excursions. On a related note: another plus is listening to how quickly Winwood's ability as a guitarist was progressing (the guitar is there, but is not prominent like it was with earlier albums), as it already is a huge step up from his offerings on \\"Welcome to the Canteen\\", and offers a glimpse of what is to come with \\"When the Eagle Flies\\" and \\"On the Road\\" (where he really sounds great). A somewhat overlooked but great classic-rock album.
0156027321|1.0|I felt absolutely nothing after reading this book. It didn't make me believe in God. I couldn't have disagreed more with the too lengthy and unpersuasive diatribe about zoos.  <br /> <br />This book is superficial fodder for people who say they want depth but are unwilling to actually confront it. In fact, it is less.  <br /> <br />There is far more spiritual philosophy in Stroud's Bartemaeus Trilogy (juvenile fiction!).
B000002J0B|5.0|I am a huge fan of Zep, so the above remark shouldn't be taken lightly. That said, the reason for my stand is that this album exhibits the band's ability with a diverse range of different music better than their other albums, most of which focus on their forte, blues-rock. This album (and to a lesser and cheesier extent, In through the Out Door) gives us a glimpse at some other genres Zeppelin could nail. There's the art-rock piece \\"No Quarter\\", a definite departure from Zeppelin's usual sound-world, the folk-sound turned rock of \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\", the reggae-ish sound of \\"Dyer-Maker\\", the funky vamps of \\"The Crunge\\", and the simply different and unique \\"Dancing Days\\". In addition, one of Zeppelin's finest ballads, \\"The Rain Song\\", appears on this album, along with another classic Zep rocker, \\"The Ocean\\". This album represents Zeppelin at their collective creative peak, with fine musical contributions from all involved (JPJ really adds a lot with his keyboard work to No Quarter, and of course, Bonham and Paige just rip as always). A must have for Classic Rock fans. If you consider yourself a Zep fan and yet don't have this album, then you better go get it. It's not as raw as Zeppelin I - IV, but then that is what stands out about this album: impeccable prodcution and more creative songwriting than before. Worth a look even from Zeppelin-haters.
0800177177|5.0|Having viewed this first at the theatre, and then on video years later, I can state unequically that this is easily the best horror movie I've ever seen! And it was just as good the second time around! It even follows the classic book fairly well!  The gruesome beginnings of the massacres of the infidels way back in the 1300's !From the ghoulish letters in 1880's London, and the stagecoach ride through the dark, misty, mysterious Carpathian mountains, into the Count's creepy castle, this is definitely totally genius filmmaking! All the actors have great roles, though Oldman as the Count has the top! Check out the brooding,shadowy scenes in the castle, the character transformations, especially the multi-charactered Dracula morphing into any numbers of truly weird personages. And the Count's trip in a rat packed/plague carrying boat to England, into his transformation as an unusual (!) foreign gent with a strange accent. Then the trips through the city fair and old metronome movie scenes. Possibly, the action fades slightly towards the end, but that's only in comparison to the first incredible hour or so! Just a total horror masterpiece! <br />

B00000DC10|4.0|There is no other album quite like this one. This utterly cathartic album throbs with a stark, severe brand of outrage rarely encountered in music. It packs superlative rock energies and beautiful musicianship. Though this album is \\"punk\\" only so far as the political/social themes of the music, not so much for the sound style- it seems far more rock-based at it's core. The sporadic quells of electronic and jazz somehow fit the music's structure quite well, working to enhance the album into something truly transcendent of both rock and punk. The singer's throaty screams seem to fiercely ignite the album, riling the listener while having a crucial artistic purpose.    \\"Deadly Rythm\\" lifts off from a jazzy intro fiercely into a tangled coelecence of riffs and drums which drive the song into perhaps the most interesting rock/jazz territory on the album. The album sees some more traditional song structure with \\"New Noise\\" an anthem of cultural stagnation. Every song is interesting and part of a larger sonic movement and cultural proposition. When the song \\"Tanhauser/Derive\\" finally hits, you realize how insanely rare this sort of integrity is in most music, and especially in punk or rock. You realize how multi-talented and passionate the creator must be in order to make it. Perhaps this album may even change your perspective on what even constitutes as music. This material is fierce.    Few musicians are capable of touching people this closely. It is such a rare moment in music when a maturing band transcends their own former musical barriers. It seems only fitting that a band of this unwieldly caliber would eventually implode just as they finally matured.

B00064WSNW|5.0|This incarnation of King Crimson is more danceable than their previous albums.  King Crimson is a very mature four-piece outfit, aware of the norm which they incorporate and counterbalance with ingenuity.  They have made a significant contribution to progressive rock.  Besides their technical mastery King Crimson is not artistically lacking.  They tap into the left side of their brain unlike Rush, Dream Theater, Vai, etc. - a few exceptions granted.  The percussion of King Crimson has a 'tribal' feel due to Bill Bruford's light-touch style and the ground rules laid by Robert Fripp, the guitar genius; you can read these rules in the cd leaflet, perhaps with some squinting.  In fact, if you write or play, the rules are insightful; one of Fripp's points argues against simultaneous phrasing, a key to their dynamic composition.  Tony Levin plays a guitar-bass hybrid called 'the stick'.  Unfortunately, Levin's sound gets a bad rap for giving Crimson an 80s sound.  Levin played all of the memorable bass lines on Peter Gabriel's songs, which are great and very 80s and unforgiven by nearsighted youngsters (i'm only 21 by the way).  You can compare King Crimson to Pink Floyd, Tool, Primus, ELP(emerson,lake,palmer).  To those with a taste for prog rock, 'Discipline' and 'Three of a Perfect Pair' should be in your cd wallet!

B000006NPY|4.0|I've always been a huge Smashing Pumpkins fan. I was recently listening to Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (which is my favorite album of all time!) and thinking how good the music is, particularly 'Galapagos' and 'Muzzle'. I've owned Ava Adore since it was released and never really liked it. Now, almost ten years later, I put it in on a whim. Ava Adode, while softer than Mellon Collie, is certainly worth hearing! Although I'm not really a fan of the title track, cuts like 'Pug' and 'Behold! The Night Mare' are certainly excellent and well-crafted pieces.

With the exception of implyiing that today's horror lacks both originality and no longer dealing with the more complex matters of the psyche, opting instead for a more simpler, formulaic torturing of \\"the flesh,\\" he gives a glowing review of the film.   <br /> <br />How often have we picked up a newpaper or seen a TV ad giving a raving review for a movie, citing some guy's name who we've never heard of before, only to find out later that he was made-up by the marketing team behind the film or some real nobody who's nothing more than a struggling playwright or writer trying to make extra cash on the side.   <br /> <br />Fetzer is no exception.  Haivng only a blog (right there that shoudl tell you something, for only vaid and the mentally/emotionally needy and challenged have a blog), Fetzer's bio reveals him to be a \\"playwright\\" re-writing old fairy tales like Beauty and the Beast and writing decidedly more \\"adult\\" themed plays whose central focuses are violence and sex.  I guess Fetzer would know then something about a lack of talent and having to fall upon matter of the flesh, the more simpler aspects of art production. <br /> <br />Bottom line is that quite literally Fetzer's paycheck depended on him writing a good review that would sell the product that Amazon's advertisers are selling and also have a good review on file for when the DVD comes out.  Which company will post a bad review for a future product and put off advertisers and companies at the same time?  Just think about it. <br /> <br />Fetzer is enslaved, but as for his actual liking the movie is open to debate.  It could be that he is enslaved to give the movie a more positive review than is merited and that he still likes the film; there is after all no accounting for bad taste. <br /> <br />And bad taste it is to think this movie is anything by terrible.  Not for the blood and scenes of extreme violence.  Not even for the scene of where a person takes a chainsaw to a person and literally cuts them apart.  It is for the nihilistic apathy of how humans are portrayed and the complete lack of respect for the intelligence and sensibility of the audience member.  There is no more art here than, say, smearing fecal matter on a canvas is art.  Only a genuine moron would think otherwise.   <br /> <br />Fetzer says there is some poltiical \\"subtext\\" becuase the \\"sardonic joke\\" is that sadists are willing to pay more money to torture Americans because everyone hates them.   <br />Apparently, he didn't watch the movie very well.  Actually, it is Asian females that command the highest price in the film, Americans coming in next, but regardless of the race or nationality, females withint comparable race and national category being of higher value.  What \\"subtext\\" is there in that?: That perhaps society places higher value on women and it is so more taboo to dismember a woman and so richly more decadent an act and thus more valuable a commodity? <br /> <br />One could think of so many \\"clever\\" reasons, but there is not insightful political message, overt or hidden here.  Despite Fetzer comparing this film to others like the Devil's Rejects, calling them a display of \\"brainless sadism\\" compared to Hostel, Hostel is truly a aimless, pointless film, and moreover to borrow Fetzer's own description: Hostel is truly brainless as well. <br /> <br />Eli Roth has confused an attempt to shock for talent, and is sadly mistaken in thinking the former could ever be a substitute for the later--no matter how much blood or how many severed limbs are thrown at the audience. <br /> <br />There is not even one scene in the entire movie that resonates with you, in which you feel even an iota of compassion or concern for anyone.  The characters are so one-dimensional and unlikable and truly uninteresting.  There is no interest to know why these sadists are the way they are, what makes them proverbially \\"tick,\\" or how they got there.  We sense no undercurrent of a past somehow subtly at play in their lives.  The villains, ironically, are the most boring of all characters in the film!  That is truly a first for the \\"horro\\" genre, perhaps the only really original thing that Roth can make claim. <br /> <br />Yet Hostel is not even an horror film; it is genuinely nonsensical with a thinly told, barely contained narrative that is peppered with a host of unbelievable plot flaws, from how what effectively is a death industy can stay in operation without attract unwanted attention despite there being seemingly hundrends of people disappearing in the town each year to how unrealistic it is that every last victim was never missed.   <br /> <br />As for character and plot development, there is none, and there is barely passable acting \\"talent,\\" if you can call it \\"talent.\\"  The dialgue is so lame and cheezy that you truly have to wonder if Roth might have written the screen play while under the influence of marajuana and thought at the time it was the most greates thing second to trying to ignite his fart with a lighter. <br /> <br />So dear reader, if you are a genuine horror fan, they you will not find it in this movie.  This film has all the sophistication of the sophomoric nuance of a second year film student.  Only the easily amused would find any \\"greatness\\" in it, in which that \\"greatness\\" is inversely related to their intelligence quotient. <br />
B00003CX8U|4.0|I saw this movie at least 7 times when it was in the theater, and finally bought it on dvd.  It's a fairly sardonic look at theater, and the travails of the artist--a slight step down from 8 1/2--buta glitzy, overwrought step down.  Looking back at it, there's a lot of cheese on this burger, but it's high cheese. <br /> <br />I still love this movie.  The heart sugery scene no longer makes me sqeamish.  The dancing still makes me happy.
B00004U60I|2.0|I agree with the earlier review... the most annoying part of this DVD is that Julie Clark put her own kids in it. They are unnatural in the video and I'd like to see a little more diversity throughout.  <br /> <br />My daughter will watch it as intently as Mozart and Beethoven, but I personally cannot stand to hear it and watch it with her (although I lovingly will since our Beethoven is lost and Mozart needs a break). It seems just thrown together and more like a home video.  <br /> <br />Use more boys and diverse children in the videos! <br />
B000BRBA8S|4.0|Definitely don't pass up this movie. It's beautifully filmed with interesting characters and an original plot. It may move a little slow at times but it's definitely worth the trip...
B000003TA4|4.0|Emeril says that Kurt is responsible for the lame trends in \\"Nu Metal, Pop Punk, Emo, Rap Metal, [and] Alternative.\\"  Quite the statement!  I wish I knew what \\"Nu Metal\\" bands come straight from Nirvana.  If I knew of that band, I might give it a chance.  Since I ignore Nu Metal, though, I'll just have to guess that Emeril is just ignorant.  Same with \\"Rap Metal.\\"  When did Kurt ever rap?  Kid Rock comes from his Nirvana influence?  Hardly.  More like Hank, Jr. and AC/DC.  \\"Emo\\" and \\"alternative\\" were already alive and well before Kurt played his first show.  You're just talking about the lame bands that get called that, completely unoriginal bands like Blink 182 and Sugar Ray.  Kurt is hardly responsible for them.  As for good alternative and emo bands, Fugazi's first album was out before _Bleach_, and if you don't appreciate that, I have a hard time considering you a true fan of rock, \\"grunge\\" or otherwise.  Alternative music was thriving before Nirvana, with REM and U2 already topping the charts and many more to come.<br /><br />Blaming Nirvana for all the crappy music after them is like blaming Elvis for all of the crappy rock and roll after him.  _Nevermind_, while not as raw as _Bleach_ and not as sprawling as _In Utero_ was something quite original in its time, something brimming with the angst that many of us felt and had a hard time putting into words.  \\"Something in the Way\\" still makes me want to cry.  Sure, I'm bored with \\"Teen Spirit\\" by now, just like I am bored with \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand.\\"  It doesn't make them bad songs; it makes them overplayed.  There are a good handful of songs on this one you never hear on the radio, definitely making it worthwhile to pick up, either to revisit or to discover.
B000002GB2|4.0|This CD has some great tunes that didn't see the light of day on the radio but really any of them could have. \\"Light Up\\", \\"Lorelei\\" and \\"Suite Madame Blue\\" get airplay on \\"Classic Rock\\" radio but \\"Born For Adventure\\" has always been a favorite Styx tune especially from this era.  The whole thing takes me right back to my college days when this ALBUM came out.  At the time, they were splitting time between headlining small venues and being an opening act in the larger ones.  I saw them on this tour in Lincoln, NE openning for ZZ Top, and they blew them out of the water that night!!  At any rate a great reissue and if your not so familiar with the pre-Tommy Shaw sound of Styx this is the CD to own.
B000003TAL|5.0|It's hard to rank albums for me for the most part.  Except for this one.  I think maybe Coltrane's _A Love Supreme_ is my favorite jazz album.  Perhaps Berio's _Sinfonia_ is my favorite classical piece.  I KNOW that _Daydream Nation_ is the most consistently overwhelming listening experience when it comes to punk, alternative, whatever you want to call it.  The squalling feedback, microtonal harmonies, and three-pronged lyrical attack of Thurston, Kim, and Lee was a blinding revelation to me as a teen.  Now, at twice the age, it always puts me onto a plane unlike any other album in the history of rock, one that is suffused with dread, joy, back-alley resignation, love . . . If there is a better punk record out there, I need to hear it.  I've been looking hard for twenty years now and not much comes close at all.  The ten dollar price on this one makes it an absolute no-brainer.  It's the _Sergeant Peppers_ of loud, noisy guitar music.  And twice as long, to boot.
B000AP04FG|3.0|Typical, derivitive, Hollywood action flick.  Lots of action, short on plot, mediocre acting, predictable.  Rent before buying!
B0000035E7|5.0|People call this unheralded in comparison to their two later studio commercial successes, but obviously it has its share of fans.  Since I am one, I thought I'd add my two cents.  This is Nirvana with more of the death metal (\\"Paper Cuts\\"), more of the dada lyrics (\\"Floyd the Barber\\"), more earnest balladry (\\"About a Girl\\").  It's a different band without Grohl (definitely rawer) and Kurdt, as he spelled his name at the time, was still consolidating his vision.  There are advantages to his looser outlook at the beginning of his career here.  Every other song isn't about how he hates himself, which was the case by the time of _In Utero_ (this reached its low point with \\"I Hate Myself and Want to Die\\").  Yes, he hates himself more than enough by this point (witness \\"Negative Creep\\"), but he channels that into more-focused guitar solos and more wide-ranging observations of topics onto which he can channel his post-adolescent rage AND whimsy (whimsy, something that is largely drained on \\"In Utero\\").<br /><br />I like the more orchestral and harmonic effects that crept into Nirvana after this, such as the strings on \\"Something in the Way\\" and the richness of \\"Heart-Shaped Box.\\"  The later stuff has its moment, but _Bleach_ certainly holds its own in comparison to these, even outstripping it in a few regards.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|death cab have always had a knack of writing really melancholic songs that would stick in your head for weeks, \\"transatlanticism\\" and \\"the photo album\\" being two particularly mindblowing records. initially i disliked \\"plans\\", there seemed to be a lot of focus on piano-led ballads and not enough rocking out. but it really is a grower, an album that surprises you and moves you with each listen. songs that i initially dismissed as average have slowly crept up on me and now i find that i'm singing \\"your heart is an empty room\\" or \\"brothers on a hotel bed\\" whilst going about my daily business. <br /> <br />so yeah, good record! :)
B000BKVQTS|4.0|This is probably Guilliam's most normal film ever.  That doesn't mean that it is entirely conventional, it's just more conventional than Time Bandits, Brazil or Baron Munchousen. <br /> <br />As I am a fan of Guilliam, I went to see this one in the theatre.  What I had to say about it was- not so good as I expected, but still a good film.  If you're expecting the film to top Guilliam's earlier masterpieces, you'll be disappointed.  If you give the film a more fair viewing, then you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit. <br /> <br />Like Guilliam's other works, the story is kept to a minimum while our attention is drawn to the brilliant imagery.  A little less episodic than Time Bandits or Baron Munchousen- a little more normal on that account. <br /> <br />The tale keeps up a fairly lighthearted tone most of the time, except that the imagery is consistantly dark, and sometimes violent.  So, you ought not to watch this film unless you like a bit (but not a lot) of blood. <br /> <br />Y'know, I'm thinking that this is such a dark comedy, and most people can't stand a little light-hearted torture thrown in for good measure.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|Simply put, this is the best score I've ever listened to.  And this isn't some yahoo saying that - I own over 400 movies scores which range from 1940 to 2006; and this is the cream of the crop.  It contains some of the most moving, heart breaking, powerful, uplifting, tragic music I've ever heard.  To say there aren't enough good words I can use about this CD is putting it mildly.   <br />The score grabs your attention at track 2, and never lets go.  Speaking of Bearing the Cross track, is there many more moving pieces of music you've heard in your lifetime?  I sure can't say so.  From there on, the music gets even better.  Debney uses a wide array of ethnic instruments and his own brand of powerhouse percussion and aching strings to produce a listening experience like none other. <br />Then there's Mary Goes to Jesus, followed with The Crucifixtion.  Unbelievable.  Rarely am I almost moved to tears by music alone, but with these two tracks, I was.  Then, eventually, we wind up at Resurrection, which is my favourite piece of music in the history of time.  It's impossible to describe the power, the beauty, the undeniable spirit of this track alone.  I remember my mouth being agape the first time I heard it. <br />Simply put - buy this score.  There's a reason it's one of the most successful soundtracks of all time.  Wether you're religious or a fan of scores or the exact opposite of both, I gaurentee this music will touch you in a way few others do.  Absolutely perfect.   <br />cheers <br />KZ
0440241413|5.0|I first read Can You Keep a Secret by S. Kinsella and I was delighted. I had so much fun!! <br />That day I bought the book on Amazon, I in three days I was finishing it. <br />Looking forward for the next one!!
0307276902|1.0|I have to say that this was, without a doubt, the absolute worst book ever written and rates in the top 5 of worst books I have ever read. His prose is turgid beyond belief, the dialogue invariably devolves into sermons, rants are forced and obnoxious.  <br /> <br /> <br />At least that's what I told my wife if she ever saw me pick up a James Frey book again. What a painful, torturous experience. There have been a lot of comments about the profanity in the dialogue but stupidity would be a larger concern. I have heard more intelligent conversations late at night at the local strip joints than in these hallowed halls of recovery. It took Frey (and us) 400 plus pages to get through a story that someone  with talent would have made brilliant in half that space. Frey is like an aging ball player who has hung around too long. Hang it up partner and thanks for the memories. <br /> <br />Furthermore, it's tripe. It is also one of the worst books I've ever completed reading. He (or his characters) drone on and on endlessly discussing the same internal questions over and over. Was this book ever reviewed by an editor? I suspect it wasn't. If the fluff could have been removed from this junk it would have been at least 25% shorter. Skip this one. You won't be sorry.Despite the fact that it was instantly clear that this was a simply dreadful book...In an insane fit of sadism I finished the whole thing. I see no need to elaborate and justify my comments, as there are 400 other reviews here, If you scroll through them you will find 9/10 reviews hostile. It is time to put Frey back in the Crypt... <br /> <br />It's incredible how some people believe he wrote that way on purpose. Uh-huh! Alright, he's laughing his way to the bank for now, but soon enough we'll be profiting too. There is a class action suit going on, probably the first , but certainly not the last. I wouldn't be surprised if Oprah sues him too, along with the government. Yes- the government! They don't like being LIED too!
0316666343|2.0|While reading \\"The Lovely Bones\\" I constantly complained of it's lack of style. Yes, style should be an important element in literature--especially in work that elicited that much RAVING.   <br /> <br />The premise was compelling, but the writing was dull, which made me utter the premonition: \\"In the right hands, this could make a good film\\"   <br /> <br />When I found out that Peter Jackson and his equally talented wife would be doing just that, I breathed a sigh of relief. You see, I do hope that they can make a heavenly creature (;->) out of them bones. <br />
B0006399FS|5.0|This is an amazing CD. Every song is great, and Vertigo isn't the best song on the CD. City of Blinding Lights, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, All Because Of You, and Miracle Drug are all better then Vertigo. Ths is a must buy CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Of course I deplore the coarsening of the culture, and culture doesn't get more coarse than Team America.  But you gotta like a movie that doesn't like anybody and that is willing to offend everybody. <br /> <br />Team America vindicates our winning strategy from Vietnam:  To save the village (Paris, for example) you've got to destroy it.  And then it validates my dark fantasies about destroying the most grievous annoyances of this modern world, Arec Barwin and Hans Brix, attache' intacta in Kim Jong Il's shark tank. <br /> <br />Warning!  Be a careful consumer!  Team America is not Transamerica!
B00082IJ08|4.0|When I first got the album I didn't know what to expect. Now that I have listened to it I still wouldn't know exactly what genre it belongs in, but it's great! From violins to mandolins to acoustic and electric guitars, harmonica's, cello's, sound synthesizers, drums it's all there in a wonderfully, intermitten package that is instantly addictive. Like nothing I have ever heard. There aren't a lot of lyrics, which is what prevented me from going to 5 stars. Considering the mix of hip-hop, rock, alternative, blues and soul influences seen on this album, I would have enjoyed it more with lyrics. I would love to see some remixes with artists like Eminem, Alicia Keys, Joss Stone, DMX, Jack White, Matisyahu, Jay-Z and especially Outkast adding some lyrics and a bit of their own flavor. Despite the forementioned it was STILL one of the best albums I have purchased in the last 5 years of this cookie-cutter, no-talent, uncreative and soulfully, suffering music industry.
0446577383|2.0|Another liberal viewpoint on how bad America is -- Regardless of what the middle eastern terrorists did in the book --the U.S. was equally or often more at fault and responsible for the evil deeds bestowed upon us.  I found myself getting angry for most of the book.  All the bad guys were Americans, connected to our terrible government.  The thing I don't understand is if the U.S. is so bad -- authors should stop tring to make a buck off the terrible folks. <br /> <br />The story was a little far fetched, and the book made a lot of leaps connecting a murder to a plot to kidnap the president.  I am really not sure how the Camel Club figured it all out except they had to or the book would never end! <br /> <br />I used to be a great Baldacci fan in his earlier days and this is one of the few I have purchased in the recent past based on positive reviews.  Overall I was disappointed. <br /> <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I LOVE this CD!  I also bought the DVD.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves good music!
B00005JOQ9|1.0|I thought it was just me.  After seeing all these negative reviews I feel a bit better now.  It really was a sucky ass job by Eli Roth.  I personally didn't like his other movie too, Cabin Fever.  Like Hostel it was sucky and I thought racist at times.  In Hostel, the movie has some racists undertones, especially with an Asian female being tortured.  It is definitely anti-foreignors and really shows Europeans in a very poor, dim light.  What gives with that?  Also the women are shown as nasty hoes and femme fetales and together wtih the Asian woman scene the movie has both sexist and misogynistc tones as well. <br /> <br />As a slasher movie (if you are into that) then I guess it is \\"ok,\\" but you have to wait something like two-thirds of the first hour and about half the movie to get to it.  First you are shown lots of dumb, boring acting and really bad acted sex scenes.   <br /> <br />I really did buy into all the hype and was disappointed at how it turned out.  There really isn't anything new or fresh here.  Even the theme has been done in great part in House of Wax or the unsuspecting travelers coming across the wackos off the beaten track.  It's like a total rip off from lots of other movies and not put together very well either.   <br /> <br />Given all the negative responses here, I can see that I was not the only one that bought the hype and didn't like the movie for its lies, cheap filming, and lack of story and unbelievable scenarios. <br /> <br />Go see another moive.  I did like Wolf Creek, which is still playing right now.  Saw II was very good and had a good, developed story to it, although it is on its way out of the theaters now.   <br /> <br />Peace  - Brian
B00008BXJF|5.0|Just take one listen to Fripp's solo that comes in right after each of the 'facts of life' choruses, or the incredible 'power to believe ii'. This is album is fantastiKc.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|Up until now, the definitive collection of John Lennon's solo material was 1998's \\"Lennon Legend\\", which was a single cd with 20 songs. It was not perfect, but it was a more than servicable compilation.<br /><br />Faadt forward to 2005. 25 years after his death and 65 years after his birth, Capitol Records has released \\"Working Class Hero: The Definitve Lennon\\", a two disc 38 song collection, digitally remastered and remixed. How does it hold up? Read on for my review.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-This is, quite simply, the greatest Lennon collection ever. Just about everything you need is on here, including \\"(Just Like) Starting Over\\", \\"Imagine\\", \\"Instant Karma! (We All Shine On)\\", \\"Nobody Told Me\\", \\"# 9 Dream\\" and just about every other big Lennon solo hit has been included.<br /><br />-A lot of underrated gems have been included as well.<br /><br />-The sound quality is fantastic. These songs have never ever sounded better.<br /><br />-Easy to locate.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-The liner notes are severely lacking. Seriously, someone like Lennon deserves a decent essay on his life.<br /><br />-Some of the songs are remixes, but the differences are slight if noticable.<br /><br />-Very highly priced. I found it for a little under $ 30.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent compilation that all beginning fans should snap up immediately. And hardcore Lennon fans should get it because it's perfect for the car.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I have all of the System of a Down CDs, but I hesitated on buying this one because of the title.  I thought it was a cry that the group had a bad record deal or their label was trying to take too much of the profit.<br /><br />I read up on the title and it is a frustrated message from the band, because of people stealing the album before it's release.  They went back and changed a few of the songs and they were saying, \\"Here.  Steal this album.\\" as more of a sarcastic command to fans who had already stolen the initially leaked songs.<br /><br />The other albums had to take time to grow on me, but I liked this one on first listen.  The whole album rocks.  Streamline should have been a single; it might be the best track on the album and it made for a strong ending.  Innervisions, Boom!, Nuguns, Mr. Jack, I-E-A-I-A-I-O, F**k the Sytem, and Ego Brain are the standout songs.  The \\"F**k You Pig\\" ending of Mr. Jack and the \\"Nightrider\\" guitar solo in I-E-A-I-A-I-O had me repeatedly pressing rewind.<br /><br />I think this was thier longest CD.  It definitely had the most tracks.  I've listened to their CDs enough to know that I like this one the best.  It's well worth the price.  Buy this Album!
B0009X7664|5.0|This movie should be seen by everyone..There are several good messages that all can learn by.  This is true entertainment; The way it used to be.
1932100385|1.0|Unfortunately, T. Colin Campbell has published a book that makes a mockery of what is (could be?) one of the most important health studies ever done.  I agree with Dr. Campbell that the \\"China Study\\" is a ground breaking study.  It studies and correlates  the diet and disease patterns of 65 rural counties in China.  The wonderful thing about this is that the people in the Chinese counties have presumably eaten a similar diet their whole lives and their disease patterns are relatively well characterized.  Therefore, it gives a unique look at correlations between diet, lifestyle and disease. <br /> <br />And it could have been so interesting.  Instead, Dr. Campbell has chosen to publish a book that says that veganism is best DESPITE the evidence.  I could go on and on about the problems with this book from a scientific perspective.  For now I'll direct you to &lt;a href=\\"[...]\\">the article about this study from my blog&lt;/a>.   <br /> <br />This book is a shame.  It held so much promise.  If you are REALLY interested in disease and dietary patterns in China, look for the raw data - \\"Diet, Life-style and Mortality in China\\", also by T. Colin Campbell, among others.
B0001WTUH6|3.0|Having watched the extended edition, I really couldn't see any major differences between it and the original theatrical release. Since I didn't own the original edition, this was fine for me, but those who already have it, and aren't really interested in any of the specific bonus features (commentary, featurettes on story, stunts, costumes, design, etc.) should keep this in mind.<br /><br />Underworld is highly stylized creature fetish romp. Dracula vs. the Wolfman, and their bast--er--hybrid son come home to roost. And in that sense, it works well. Kate Beckinsale does good work, decked out in black leather and steel mini-gun, and fits beautifully into the deliberately desaturated, color-corrected world.<br /><br />An effort is made to provide scientific origins for the supernatural, something also done in the recent Blade franchise, and to do more practical stunts than the CGI-Fu that has so recently come to dominate the filmscape. It doesn't always hold together, nor service the story, but the strength of the overall vision is enough to hold interest.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|This is a really horrible movie.  There is absolutely nothing going for it.  I had to turn it off after an hour and I can't remember the last movie I didn't bother to finish watching. <br /> <br />Terry Gilliam, aside from his legendary work with Monty Python, is probably the most overrated director there is.  Jabberwocky and Time Bandits were horrible. Brazil and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas were hit and miss.  His last good film was Twelve Monkeys...from 1995...11 years ago; and it doesn't look like he'll ever make another one. <br /> <br />So skip this one...or at least skip the first hour...who knows, maybe the last half was pure genius.
0307276902|4.0|Loved the book. I read it before anything came out and I do admit, loved it more but this does not affect me much at all (the only reason why I gave it 4 stars). <br /> <br /> The writing kept me reading, in fact, I had to put the book down because I didn't want it to end. I WILL go out and buy his new book, I enjoyed this one very much (I admit I was crushed when the news came out) but overall, it was intriguing and I was fascinated by the characters. <br />
0345350499|5.0|No need to say more.  The book arrived well packed, in early than specified time in perfect shape.
0451527046|5.0|Wow.  It may be days until my mind allows me passage back for this memorable island.  A part of me may always be marooned there.  The words, sentences, paragraphs and chapters of this book were indeed the true treasure.<br /><br />Jim Hawkins was the perfect narrator for this story as I doubt any other character would have ignited my imagination as much as a boy. His naivety earned my heart and he held onto it with his bravery.  His tempo was invigorating and captivating.  Combined with the simplicity of his age, his account was easily read and brought me many quick hours of turning pages.<br /><br />He also was given an interesting supporting cast, including a \\"Gentleman of Fortune\\" I would dare never forget ~ the infamous Long John Silver.  I think he was written perfectly, notorious though admirable.<br /><br />This book is easily recommendable for young and old alike.  There is no question on why it is a classic.
B000002MTU|5.0|I have heard a lot of Eric Clapton blues over the years and this album has them all beat. Clapton shines on this one. From the opening track to the last one, he really lets the mojo out. I have listened to the whole cd through iTunes and then a surround sound system. <br /> <br />I know that there are some people that think that track number 5 is the best. I have to disagree. While track 5 does have an excellent guitar solo, track 7-Going Away Baby really rocks. If you listen closely, you will hear one of the finest guitar riffs in blues. I have played this track over and over just because of this riff.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this album has some of the finest blues songs ever written on it, but there are a few tracks on this cd that really has the mojo.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I thought it was a great film. I've been following Elijah Wood's career since he was a kid and his choices of scripts never  ceased to please me. And \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" is yet another film that didn't disappoint.  <br /> <br />Being Russian I know that most foreign films about post-Soviet countries rarely have something in common with reality. This film, on the other hand, is very accurate and believable. All the actors are brilliant. <br /> <br />I am definitely buying the DVD when it's on sale.

B0002B15WE|5.0|Die Hard is the kind of movie that Hollywood does best. Fast paced action, crisp dialogue, hateable villains, lovable heros, explosions and, of course, quotable lines: Welcome to the party pal!<br /><br />Bruce Willis gives an intense, everyman caught in a tragedy performance. He is a reluctant hero, not a guy spoiling for a fight. He is you or I confronted by life and death circumstances. Fight or flight and he chose fight.<br /><br />Alan Rickman as the villan is a perfect counter punch to Willis's Action Hero. He is slimy enough, evil enough and in the end, dead enough to make you boo and hiss at him and then cheer when he gets the goods.<br /><br />This is a real \\"guy\\" movie and young children probably should not watch it because of the intense violencs.<br /><br />This is the best of the series and may be one of the best action film ever made.

B00005JOFO|5.0|I've read the book and watched the film and I must say that Brokeback Mountain is an excellent film, well-made, beautifully directed with a haunting soundtrack and the perfect cast! Both Heath and Jake have an amazing chemistry on screen! <br /> <br />In a nutshell, Brokeback Mountain is a bittersweet love story between two individuals, their love story is both tragic and beautiful at the same time. It is about a love that is altogether sweet, complicated, delicate, haunting, unfulfilled, frustrating and devastating. The moral of the story... if you are unable to be true to yourself and be with the one you truly love and desire, you may well end up destroying not only your own life but the lives of others around you... love is that strange and selfish. <br /> <br />Highly recommended, however, having an open mind is a must. Enjoy!
B000000P17|4.0|Ok well a lot of people have slandered this cd but if you can respect a lot of punk/punk rock music such as the New York Dolls, The Damned, Iggy Pop etc, then this is brilliant. It's so listenable and it's still rock n' roll. Duff McKagans vocals on New Rose, Attitude, You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory etc., are catchy. This is what inspired the members of Guns N' Roses so you might want to remember that. It's just a good album, simple as.
0684857219|4.0|This is a very good book which teaches the basics of weight lifting as well as advanced bodybuilding. Someone above talked about how Arnold was jacked up on steroids and isn't a scientist and how he only was huge because bodybuilding was his life. First of all, back in Arnold's day most serious and competetive bodybuilders took steroids because they didn't know how serious the side effects were. However, when the side effects were discovered Arnold stopped using and became one of the most adament people against steroid use. Secondly, if you're a professional bodybuilder, bodybuilding is your life. Finally, nobody can be completely sure about anything in weightlifting, but I would much rather listen to the greatest bodybuilder (who's training techniques have won him many titles)than some scientific research.
1400031087|1.0|I bought Frey's book in December before the story broke about the fictional aspects of his story and I have to admit that I didn't like the book and didn't bother finishing it.   <br /> <br />I got to the point of the book just after his brother visited him in the facility.  I didn't find his writing style vivid or captivating.  He repeated the same things over and over again, and I wanted to hear more details about his experiences.  I could only read but so much of passages that say, \\"I want drugs, I want crack, I want to do a lot of it\\".  Seriously, I'm surprised that people can tolerate this kind of writing. <br /> <br />
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Firstly, let me state that I do not like screaming in rock music but since I liked City of Evil so much that I decided to take a listen to this. All I'd heard from the cd was one of the better songs on it, Chapter 4, from Madden 2004. If you dont think that their drummer has talent, I will shoot ya in the head right now. The intro to that song is just so amazing with the drums. That song gives you a taste of the amount of talent these guys have. So,I listen to \\"Chapter 4\\", and I begin to think that the cd will be as good as everyone says it is. In a way it is, but in a way it isn't. I would really only recommend this cd for the songs \\"Unholy Confessions\\", \\"Chapter 4\\", and The amazing \\"I won't see you tonite pt.1\\". \\"I wont see you tonite pt.1\\" really is what makes this cd so amazing. It reminds me alot and I mean alot of \\"November Rain\\" by Guns N Roses. But they went and screwed it up by making a pt.2. That song shows how the cd can go from \\"HELL YA!\\" to \\"What The F*** is that!?\\". I highly recommend this cd ONLY FOR \\"Unholy Confessions\\",\\"Chapter 4\\", and \\"I won't see you tonite pt.1\\". Dont get me wrong, the singer screams alot better then most, because I can actually stand it and normally I cannot stand screaming songs. I would recommend \\"City of Evil\\" more just because it is one of the only cds that most people I know can sit down and just listen to.

B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I have to say, when i first read about paramore in alternative press. i figured \\"oh its just another avril wannabe\\" but after listening to paramore's debut \\"all we know is falling\\" i fell in love with it. paramore strayed far away from what i was expecting, the songs \\"Pressure\\" and \\"Here we go again\\" we among the ones i first listened to before i bought the cd. as soon as the pop punk music began in \\"Here we go again\\" i rushed out to buy the cd. with lead singer Hayley Williams (17) harmonic vocals and the bands pop punk/ emo music this cd is sure to be an instant favorite/
B00004UFTU|5.0|I can remember the guy at our local Record store telling me about this \\"new band\\" in England who were really good. Evidently all the Iron Maiden fans were into them, they were called Marillion. So I listened to this album and from the first notes thought, sounds more like Peter Gabriel back with Genesis to me, being a big Genesis fan I thought... I'll take it!  <br /> <br />Listening to it at home that night, the first track made me think of what would have been the first new track after the \\"Lamb lies down on Broadway\\", it just sounded so Gabriel period Genesis. By the end of the album I played it again it was fantastic one of the best albums I had ever heard. The lead singer (Fish) was very emotional both lyrically and in his vocal style - and also sang with great passion. Guitarist Steve Rothery seemed very talented and at times reminded me of Steve Hackett (who was in Genesis from 1971 - 1977). Mark Kelly - Keyboards was also very accomplished, as was drummer Mick Pointer on drums and Pete Trewavas on Bass (who would also join up with Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), Neal Morse (Spock's Beard) and Roine Stolt (Flower Kings) to form a superb \\"sideline\\" band called \\"Transatlantic\\" in 2001).  <br /> <br />Certainly the intensity and emotion of the lyrics / vocals and music combined were captivating to me and it was an album that I played over and over and seemed to find something new in each listening. The songs build beautifully and contain a number of changes (of the 6 tracks 4 are over the 8 minute mark (Script for a Jesters Tear / Chelsea Monday / The Web / Forgotten Sons), Garden Party clocks in at 7 minutes. (The shortest track is \\"He Knows You Know\\" at just over 5 minutes). The title track was a highlight for me together with the song about drugs - \\"He knows You Know\\", \\"Garden Party\\" (which would go on to become an in concert favourite) and \\"Forgotten Sons\\" (which reminded me a lot of \\"The Knife\\" from Genesis (from Tresspass - 1970). \\"The Web\\" is a very well put together track with \\"Chelsea Monday\\" providing brilliant guitar work (both electric and acoustic) and again very well put together, very emotional.  <br /> <br />In summary, a stunning debut album from a band that sounded so \\"Gabriel style Genesis\\" to me that had Genesis released it I would have been over the moon. It is really that good. Fish's lyrics and powerful vocal delivery together with Steve Rothery's exceptional electric and acoustic guitar work really carry this album to another level.  <br /> <br />For me this is an extremely enjoyable album from start to finish. I enjoy listening to it as much today as I first did almost 24 years ago. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do, it's superb. <br />
0307276902|5.0|<br />Frey has written a great book about a subject that gets little attention.  No one sets out to become an addict, but once your addicted, your life turns into a downward spiral that seems impossible to overcome.  <br />Enter Frey and his honest account of what addiction does to us and how addicts can face their fears and overcome the bondage of <br />drugs and alcohol. <br />Written in a compelling and entertaining style that defies current journalism standards, Frey keeps us on the edge of our seats.   <br />A brilliant story of hanging onto life no matter what.  A story so remarkable that no amount of bad press can detract from it's message of hope and redemption. <br />Sunny
B000000YBQ|5.0|The definition of a piano jazz trio.  I'll leave it to people who know what they are talking about to describe the technicalities of the music.  For the layperson, this is piano jazz at its best.  I can't get enough Evans, but if I had to take one Evans recording to the proverbial desert island...this is it.  The title track is, maybe, my favorite piece of music of any sort.  It's light, it's buoyant, it's whimsical, it's melancholy, it's playful, it's timeless, it's Bill Evans, Scott Lofaro and Paul Motian making magic.  If for some reason you are on the fence about this recording, climb down off the fence, punch the appropriate keys and order this CD.
B000AMWIVM|2.0|The original Saw opens up with an interesting premise. Two guys wake up in a room together...no, it's not that kind of movie! They're both chained to the wall and given a...wait for it, wait for it...SAW! Through the course of the film they have to follow various clues in order to find a way out of the room. There is also a countdown they have to worry about. <br /> <br />The writers aren't able to make this premise fully work, and are forced to resort to flashbacks and a side story involving Danny Glover. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. First, because the flashbacks allow us to see Jigsaw's, the mysterious villain, more elaborate traps. Second, because you just can't complain when Murtaugh is on screen. <br /> <br />The Jigsaw traps are clever, and involve barbed wire, someone getting burned to death, and a contraption that could potentially tear off someone's jaw. I won't get into too much detail for those of you who haven't seen this movie. I'll save the spoilers for later. <br /> <br />There's a lot of nitpicking you could do on the first two-thirds of the film. For example, the flashback are supposed to be told by one character but include things he never would have seen or known about, the camera effects are annoying, and the surviving victim has a really dumb line. I was able to ignore these because it was an interesting premise and had potential. However, I was unable to ignore the last third of the film which had some of the laziest screenwriting I've seen in a while. <br /> <br />**Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler Alert** **Spoiler...oh, you get the idea. <br /> <br />Cary Elwes gets out of character at the end of the film. For most of the movie he's a calm and collected, but turns on the overacting button at the very end. This isn't all his fault because he has to sell certain actions that make no sense. Early in the film Elwes' character, Dr. Gordon, tells Adam, the other man in the room, to use his shirt to get an object out of reach. Atthe end of the film Dr. Gordon has to reach a cell phone in order to find out if his family is all right. Instead of following his own advice, he decides to cut off his own leg. I know everybody's been waiting for this the entire film, but does it have to be so contrived. The worst part is that he does take off his shirt, but instead of using it to get the phone he uses it as a tourniquet! <br /> <br />One of the big surprises of the film is that the man who we've been lead to believe is Jigsaw is in fact merely being used by Jigsaw. It turns out that Jigsaw has given him a poison and won't give him the antidote unless he follows his instructions. We've seen this character before as an orderly at a hospital. Let me repeat that: he works at a hospital. So, instead of telling one of his coworkers that he's been poisoned, he decides to get involved with an elaborate scheme of kidnapping, and even goes so far as to try and kill someone. I know that if I was presented with those two choices I would definitely go for the latter. <br /> <br />The single big surprise the filmmakers graciously leave for the end is the identity of Jigsaw. Jigsaw is actually a cancer patient we see for a total of three seconds during the movie. It also turns out that the dead body is not actually dead, but this same cancer patient who has been sitting there perfectly still for the entire movie. Whoa! You mean to tell me that extra number 37 was Jigsaw this entire time? No way! I should have guessed, it was right in front of me the whole time. <br /> <br />I've seen better twist endings from a Scooby-Doo episode. That's not hyperbole either. If you want to see how it should be done check out The Usual Suspects or the original Scream. Those are surprise endings where you don't feel cheated. <br /> <br />It's a real shame that the writers came up with such an original idea, but chose to get incredibly lazy for the last third of the movie. If you really want to see a well done horror film that actually uses one set, go check out Cube. The acting isn't better, but the execution is far more interesting. <br />
B00000I41G|5.0|The real beauty of \\"Midnight Blue\\" is the cohesiveness of the whole package.  I heard \\"Chitlins Con Carne\\" on Pure Jazz on the Sirius Satellite Radio and was smitten and had to check out the recording.  So few recordings actually achieve what Kenny Burrell does here which is deliver a group of very distinct, individually excellent pieces that are all quite interesting on their own, but stunning in their totality.  The guitar work sizzles, but never stings.  Wonderful stuff.
B00008MNYS|5.0|This was my introduction to Robbie Williams, and it happened by accident.  I was getting the oil in my car changed and I had a half an hour to kill, so I went into a record store next door.  I was in there for about 5 minutes when \\"Feel\\" started to play.  \\"Great song\\" I thought, but didn't give it much thought.  Then \\"Monsoon\\", \\"Sexed Up\\", \\"Get A Little High\\", \\"Come Undone\\", \\"Something Beautiful\\", and then the amazing \\"Love Somebody\\".  WHO WAS THIS GUY???  I went to the counter and asked who's Greatest Hits album were they playing?(Yes, this CD is THAT good)  30 seconds later, I owned ESCAPOLOGY.  What an amazing CD.  I've since invested in all of his CDs.  There are a lot of reviews here wondering why Americans don't embrace Robbie Williams the way they do in Europe.  Simple.  Radio stations don't play new music anymore.  Classic rock won't play new albums by the old bands.  Pop/hip hop stations will only play packaged, synthesized \\"artists\\".  And adult contemporary stations, I don't know what their problem is.  This guy should be to the 90's and today what Elton John was to the '70's.  The songs are incredible, the production flawless.  If you haven't discovered Robbie Williams yet, don't hesitate, buy ESCAPOLOGY now!  One final word, \\"Love Somebody\\" is an incredibly haunting and beautifully arranged song.  Truly a classic CD all around.

B00007ELF2|5.0|I was very impressed with Traffic. I love this Criterion release, because it is stocked with so many extra feaures. One of my favorite is the countless number of Police Dogs that you can flip through, with their history (like their \\"biggest bust\\") and their pictures and info of them. Also, about the actual movie, the transfer is great. It looks great. It sounds great. Yes, like most Criterion movies, the sticker tag is above $25, but don't let that stop you. This is a Must Have.

B00000IQV7|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the book \\"Gesundheit: Good Health is a Laughing Matter\\" by Hunter Doherty Adams with Maureen Mylander.<br /><br />Mike Farrell of \\"M*A*S*H\\" fame was one of the producers of this movie.<br /><br />This movie is also based on the true story of Hunter \\"Patch\\" Adams.<br /><br />At the movie's beginning we are taken to the psychiatric ward of a hospital in 1969.  We discover here how Hunter Adams (Robin Williams) gets his unique nickname of \\"Patch\\" and why he decides to become a medical doctor.<br /><br />Two years later he goes to medical school where he encounters, among other things, a snobby roommate named Mitch (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a very traditional medical school dean (Bob Gunton), meets a fellow medical student named Truman (Daniel London) who becomes his good friend, and as well meets a stand-offish female medical student Corinne (Monica Potter) who eventually sees his point of view with respect to medicine.<br /><br />Patch's antics at the hospital where he learns to become a doctor are hilarious.  (These antics almost get him kicked out of medical school.)  But there is a method to his madness as he wants to humanize medicine.  His underlying philosophy is:<br /><br />\\"A doctor's mission should be not just to prevent death but also to improve the quality of life [of patients].\\"<br /><br />He eventually has a brainstorm of building a free clinic called the \\"Gesundheit Institute\\" and to get started he starts a free clinic while still attending medical school.<br /><br />A tragedy occurs but Patch is able to overcome it.<br /><br />The movie ends by giving the viewer the following information:<br /><br />\\"During the next twelve years, Patch Adams opened a home-based family medical practice and treated more than 15,000 people without payment, malpractice insurance, or formal facilities...construction of the Gesundheit Hospital is currently underway.  To date [1998], a waiting list of over 1000 physicians have offered to leave their current practice and join Patch's cause.\\"<br /><br />All the acting is good but Robin Williams as Patch gives an interesting performance.  Even though he delivers sidesplitting humor, I felt that it wasn't over-the-top and is balanced quite well with the inspiring, dramatic, and true story.  I was also surprised by Daniel London's excellent performance as Truman, Patch's sidekick.  Monica Potter's Corinne character is somewhat one-dimensional but she makes the best of it.  Philip S. Hoffman also does a good job as the serious medical student named Mitch.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the background music.  It adds to each scene of the movie.<br /><br />Some people (including Roger Ebert) don't seem to like this movie.  However, according to Amazon's \\"Theatrical Release Information\\" (see above), this movie whose budget estimate was $50 million has taken in $194 million worldwide garnering a profit of almost $145 million.  So the big question is, \\"Why don't some people not like this movie.\\"  The main reason, I think, is that (believe-it-or-not) some people are satisfied with the traditional medical system as it is today and don't like anything (such as this movie) that criticizes it.  Thus, I would not recommend this movie to such traditionalists.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (collector's edition) has excellent picture and sound quality.  There are a few extras, all of them interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an inspiring movie based on a true story that effectively displays Robin Williams' comic and dramatic talents.  It is not to be missed!!<br /><br />(1998;  1 hr,50 min;  widescreen)<br /><br />+++++leave their current practice and join Patch's cause.\\"<br /><br />All the acting is good but Robin Williams as Patch gives an interesting performance.

0739308742|2.0|Oh dear....5 years wait and this is what we get to feed our starving souls!  Perhaps it could be the fact the last book, Storm of Swords, was probably the best one in a superb series, or the fact that Mr Martin had to cut the book in half, not the usual way though, but straight down the middle, somewhat butchering it in the process.  Strong words, I hear you cry, but take a look and see for yourselves, or perhaps not.  So much of what was good in the previous novels in the series is missing here. Gone are some of the major characters, to be replaced with so many minor ones. Even with those that are left nothing really seems to happen.  The whole pace of the the series has slowed, with very little excitement, and quite frankly it's boring. Where's the headlong movement from one characters seemingly endless possibilities to the next.  I feel a dark foreboding.  Have the best books in the series already been written?  Let us hope not, for this is one of the great works of modern fantasy.  Let us hope that the author will find a return to form, and continue to give us the excitement, intrigue, and adventure that he left us wanting more of after the magnificent Storm of Swords.  Incidentally, the narrator on the audio book version was changed from the stupendous Roy Dotrice, so that version is even worse.  You have been warned!

Not only were the actors playing Julian the custest five year-olds ever, but it was more than just an okay comedy. I laughed a ton and almost cried when Julian was taken away. I never cry during movies, so this was incredible. If you are looking for a funny and touching flick rent this movie.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book before all the national hype began. <br /> <br />James Frey had been on a local Boston radio station in September or October of 2005 and had said that parts of the book were exaggerated. <br /> <br />For me this book was great.  It was interesting to feel that I was inside the rambling, unsure, self-centered mind of an addict. <br /> <br />I feel that for any one that is in recovery, struggling with recovery or involved with someone recovering this book gives really terrific insight. <br /> <br />James, if you see this, good job.

1400031087|4.0|James Frey's \\"memoir\\" was a great tale of recovery. Unfortunately, Frey has become the scapegoat for all non-fiction writers who have embellished. In my opinion, it's not exactly fair, for Oprah to narrow in on just one memoir, when there are heaps of  non-fiction best selling authors who are guilty of the same, Take a look at... e.g. Hunter S. Thomson, Auguston Buroughs, Richard Brautigan. You will find fallacies in all of them! And yet they are all still worthy reads, why should this book in particular take the heat, it was an awesome  and inspiring book, leave it at that. yes- a little disclosure would have been nice, but it's not all that uncommon -a lot of non-fiction... tends to be a bit of a reach in  my opinion, I'm just saying... ` Running with Scissors' for example, another great read, ---Do I really think it all \\"went down\\" one hundo percent as written?  Well... probably not, and I'd still re- read the book again. Take Frey off the grill.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|The most significant thing about this movie is that it stands head and shoulders above most others released on DVD over this last year or so. I would love to say that this is because of the enduring qualities of the opposition but I cannot. Relatively speaking it is one of the better movies of the year but sadly, that is not saying very much.<br /><br />I loved several things about the movie, beginning with the aerial shot of the birds over the lake. I am a sucker for good photography and that piece is exquisite. I relished too, the live shots among the locations and with the indigenous people. Far more realistic and inclusive than In My Country for example, and generating a greater impact than would otherwise have been the case. The cast in general was strong and I feel that Ralph Fiennes is almost becoming stereotyped in the strong, quiet man role which was very reminiscent of the English patient.<br /><br />For me though the best parts of the movie were the way in which the flashbacks and current time were intermeshed which brought a great deal of reality to the proceedings. The things that he took for granted or did not pay attention to at the time assume a different significance in hindsight and his focus on his garden leads him to take for granted his wife's deep love for him. How like real life this is. Coupled with that was the interplay of dark political and human forces around him which are not in his vision which is focussed on tending his plants but which finally subsumes them culminating in the end set in the desert.<br /><br />On the debit side, I think that the plot does not live up to earlier La Carre work. Set in the more contempoary world of global politics, his knowledge of the machinations of those involved in national and international politics is a little thinner here although there is clearly a good dose of reality in the concerns about the power of multinational corporations and their ability to use that power ruthlessly. It seems to me too that the author should rest his representation of the wives of the central character to be wayward and perceived to be untrustworthy. Whilst in this case, the evidence absolves her of these charges, the fact that Le Carre needs to use such a device once more detracts from the plot. I was a little uneasy too about the ease with which Ralph Fieenes manages to get back to Africa after his passport is confiscated. For a mid ranking Foreign Office official he certainly proves to be very capable.<br /><br />Overall I award four stars to this movie. One of only a handful of better movies of the last twelve months. It raises some serious moral questions about nations, and transnational organisations in the twenty-first century but is a pretty good movie too.e too that the author should rest his representation of the wives of the central character to be wayward and perceived to be untrustworthy.

B00000JPH6|5.0|Few people are aware of the \\"story behind the story\\" of The Dark Crystal! It was written by a (former?) Catholic priest to represent his belief about the true story of God's Creation from the very beginning to the end of time -BUT from the approach that our God is \\"unconditionally\\" loving rather than One with brutally vengeful hell-fire and brimstone. (I know...this not the way I learned the story in my Christian upbringing either, but this author's story of \\"what life is all about\\" rings so much more true to me now).      This priest/author went to the Muppets genius, Jim Henson, to produce the characters because he felt that human actors would not be able to portray all of beings that are storied in religions. Perhaps too, this inspired priest/author wanted a humble, low budget, but effective way of telling the world's most important story.     In case you're wondering, I read about this film's background stuff in an interview that was done with the author a couple years after this film came out. He said that both he and Henson had expected the film to be a blockbuster. However, the film's message went right over the heads of most viewers...perhaps the message was presented too abstractly. Subsequently -and unfortunately- The Dark Crystal has been relegated to \\"The Creepy Children's Stories\\" bin. Sad, because I think it is a work of genius. I'm not alone in this belief because I've met three very intellectual deep-thinkers who say they have watched it 7, 13, and 23 times repectively -each time learning something new!     The film is packed with many SEEMINGLY casual images (mountains in the background, etc.) -which actually represent important places and events in Christianity, Buddhism, Islam -even Buddhism. The more of a religious scholar one is, the more symbols he/she is likely to recognize. The Dark Crystal has very memorable and powerfully interesting characters who represent many of Christianity's/Islam's/Judism's important figures. It's fun to try to figure out the meanings of the various events in the film and WHO it is that each of the Dark Crystal's characters represent.     Everything means something in this film! And the ending! To me, the ending in The Dark Crystal rings totally true of what an UNCONDITIONALLY loving God would have in store for all of His created children -us humans and the Angels that came before us.     Okay, now you have the author's perspective. Kids can still enjoy The Dark Crystal as simply \\"some fun characters' exciting adventure.\\" However, I invite you to watch this film with God's Creation in mind...and see if you still think it's nothing more than a kiddie flick! The Dark Crystal not only worthy of being the blockbuster that the author thought it would be, but I think it's a profound and inspired film. It's great for interesting discussion after watching. Check it out!
B000A7DVR2|3.0|I dunno why I'm bothering to write this review, as I don't have too much too say and I'm just gonna annoy people, but I feel the impulse.  Anyway, it seems like 'The Big Lebowski' is the most popular Coen brothers film for people in my age bracket, but I can't entirely get into it.  It's got some funny parts, and the main characters are all charming enough and all, but it just seems like it's trying too hard much of the time.  For example, the major dream sequence towards the end: Lame.  Doesn't work, trying too hard.  Furthermore, the film as a whole just generally goes nowhere.  Considering these characters that's pretty much all that could happen, but it just really starts to drag after a while with no focus.  I guess my problem is I don't like the Coens as much when they're doing pure comedy. (And I'd probably have to pick 'Blood Simple' as their best movie, which is, of course, their most purely dramatic movie.  By the way, don't make the mistake of ignoring that film, as it seems like more than a few Coen fans have.  It's amazing.)  Frankly, I think their sorta inexplicable, oddball comedy works best when it's juxtaposed with the violence and darkness.  Though that's not all that's at the heart of 'The Big Lebowski's relative weakness, as I like both 'Raising Arizona' and 'The Hudsucker Proxy' better than it as well and they're both really light hearted.  Still, though I don't think it requires any repeat viewings, 'The Big Lebowski' is definitely worth one look, anyway.  Even when they're pretty of the Coens can make something quite a bit different and more interesting than what you'll usually get at the movies.<br /><br />Grade: C+
B000069AUI|5.0|I love Coldplay's first album but I really love their second. It has much more umph to it than the first. Just the titles give that a way. \\"Parachutes\\" sounds kind of dreamy and easy going. \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" sounds much more full of excitement and life. The album is just that.
0307276902|1.0|As a recovering alcoholic with over 19 years of sobriety I take the struggles that alcoholics and addicts go through very seriously.  What we've been through and what we go through to get us to where we are is important not only to us but to those hoping to gain from our trials and tribulations.  What I have found, and what AA teaches us is that total honesty is important.  Lying, for some of us is what got us in to trouble in the first place.  And embellishing the truth never served to emphasize the real truth of what we must go through to get sober and clean.  I don't ever discount what another has gone through in their recovery.  But to be an example to others I feel that honesty is important.  When you find that someone has lied, embellished, or even simply stretched the truth it tends to call into question everything they say from that moment on; has it really been 13 years for Mr. Frey?  Or is that another embellishment too?  To be an inspiration to others how about setting a good example.  Build your house on solid ground and it will stand the test of time.  Build your house on mud and quicksand and it will fall around your ears.  I know my foundation and sobriety are strong today because I was able to be \\"brutally honest\\" with myself and others.  Can Mr. Frey say the same?
0670881791|2.0|Uptight guy versus bringer of joy and light. Fun food against staid religion. Haven't I seen this before? Oh yes, it was a Disney Film. I like the recipes, but the story is so hackneyed it had to be made into a movie. Death is even personified in this book; what an original idea! I read to the end because I love chocolate, but otherwise, this tedious heap of cliche is exactly what's wrong with \\"literature\\" today and doesn't merit recommendation.

B00009P1O2|5.0|I still think queens best was their 70's shows and early eighties, but \\"the Magic\\" tour was still truly magic.  I just wish people would stop with these silly comments of \\" freddie was suffering from aids during this show\\" everytime freddies voice cracks. Freddie showed no sign of his illness during this show, that should be obvious with the way he was running around on stage for three hours.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Iron Maiden's twelfth studio album, released in 2000, marked the return of singer Bruce Dickinson (who left the band in 1993, before returning in 1999) and guitarist Adrian Smith. While some other bands in their shoes would have just made a rehash of a past album and called it a \\"return to form,\\" this legendary New Wave of British Heavy Metal band continued to evolve. \\"Brave New World\\" was an appropriate title for the new record, because Iron Maiden first started to discover a more \\"progressive\\" sound. This gradual trend towards a new sound meant that the music on \\"Brave New World\\" was usually not quite as fast or exciting as most vintage Maiden albums. But, still, these songs are full of potential; some tracks, like \\"The Fallen Angel,\\" are as energetic as anything the band has ever done, and \\"The Nomad\\" is as catchy as anything they've produced this side of 1982's \\"Run To The Hills.\\"<br /><br />The instrumentalists--Steve Harris, bass; Nicko McBrain, drums; and the trio of guitarists (Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers)--are in fine form, here, and the vocals are, of course, pretty friggin' amazing! As he has proved so many times in the past, whether singing slowly and extended (during ballads like \\"Blood Brothers\\") or rather speedily, no one can hold a note or hit a hook better than Bruce Dickinson. And on this disc, he continues to pour his heart and soul into delivering his vocal parts.<br /><br />\\"The Wicker Man\\" opens up the album with a running guitar lead and soulful vocals. The next song, \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\" starts out slowly, but it eventually becomes a buzzsaw rhythm, and Bruce's proper singing and a guitar solo caps it off. Following this is the title track, which has careening guitars and an impressive vocal range which more than makes up for the somewhat repetitive lyrics. Bruce begins with kind of tuneful spoken word vocals, but his voice quickly leaps and his vocals are soaring within a matter of seconds. (Track six, \\"Dream Of Mirrors,\\" is also like this, because Bruce needs almost no time to ascend from low key crooning to a lung stretching high note.) Following the aforementioned ballad, \\"Blood Brothers,\\" comes a much more up tempo number, \\"The Mercenary,\\" which is the last standout track. It has fast, chug and churn riffs, thumping drums, and two wailing, back-to-back guitar solos.<br /><br />\\"Brave New World\\" may not have any timeless/classic songs, and some of the tracks may be overly long (see \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\"), but this album proved Iron Maiden were still a force to be reckoned with, and this has my vote for being Maiden's best effort since \\"Powerslave\\" was released in 1984.rs,\\" is also like this, because Bruce needs almost no time to ascend from low key crooning to a lung stretching high note.)

B000AARKOO|5.0|I have to be honest.  I checked this movie out because Orlando Bloom is in it.  Being a history buff, I enjoy watching historical epics, however, even if I enjoy the film, I usually end up picking it apart.  Since I'm not a huge Crusades buff, I really didn't know anything as I watched the film. <br /> <br />The movie blew me away.  The sets were amazing and the storyline was great.  When it was over, I immediately got online to learn more about the story it was based on.  It drew me in that much.  Though there are some historical innaccurcies (such as when Saladin allowed everyone to depart safely when actually Balian had to pay ransoms for those that escaped), the movie was otherwise right on.  I saw in some other reviews where it was said that Balian was not a real person, but he was.   <br /> <br />For anyone who became interested in learning more about Balian and the Crusades, there is a lot of information on him on the internet. <br /> <br />Even if your interest in history is not piqued, I still highly recommend this movie.  It is a great movie and deserved to do a lot better in the box office. <br />
0307276902|4.0|Thisis my first review for anything on Amazon. I feel compelled to write after reading some of these unbelievable comments people are leaving regarding this book. As someone who reads 2 to 3 books a week, on average, I feel qualified to leave an opinion. <br />I picked up this book in the UK, long before it made its impact in the USA. I found the book interesting, and thought provoking about the whole issue of addiction. I found his story to be from the heart. That said, I also found the tale a bit overblown, and a bit fictional, perhaps to promote the flow of the story.  <br />I passed the book onto several friends, who all had generally positive things to say about the book. One friend in recovery said that he \\"lived\\" parts of things mentioned in the book, and found it hit close to home. <br />One can assume, that most books in the autobiography or even biographic catagory have a certain amount of fiction in them. Its only natural when one tells a story. (And on the same wavelength, works of fiction, may contain some real life elements). I take most things in life with a grain of salt, especially when it comes to the media. There at least 2 other biographical books in this past year have been attacked as not being entirely truthful, so this is not something new. <br />I am saddened to see lawsuits now, arguing, among other things, that someones valuable time has been wasted. I have also seen that noted in some current reviews. That argument is without merit. No one made you read this book. You are personally responsible in how you spend your time.  <br />Just as people have tried to blame certain types of music for their violent behaviour, I also hear now that some people are blaming this book for their current state of recovery. Once again, personal responsibility. <br />For me, this is a good book, and I recommend it. Not as a classic, but a current look at addiction. And for those who do not like the book, because of the amount of fiction, then you are entitledto that. I accept that. But move on, and quit attacking the author.   <br />
0930289528|5.0|I'll admit it . . . I picked up this classic by Alan Moore more out of curiosity for the upcoming movie than for the many good things I've heard about it.<br /><br />I've got one word-wow.  This graphic novel is beyond mesmerizing.  I suppose this shouldn't have been much of a surprise considering that Alan Moore rarely misses with this genre.  I literally could not put V For Vendetta down.<br /><br />It's the story of a post-apocalyptic England.  It's the year 1997 (keep in mind this was written in 1983) and the world as we know it is gone.  Warfare has destroyed much of Western Europe, and it is only after a fascist political party steps up to take control over a lawless England that some semblance of order resumes.  However, things quickly go wrong and the people of England move from lawlessness to total oppression.  I'll leave it up to you to draw the comparisons to real life.<br /><br />One man, however, rises above it all to become a hero of the people.  He is a champion of Anarchy, saying that he believes people should voluntarily rule themselves, and he seems quite insane.  However, he fights to defeat the oppressors, and so we cheer for him.  He may have been one of our original anti-heroes in the graphic novel medium.  His identity is a mystery, as is his source funding for his elaborate operations, but he fights against the tyrants ruthlessly, using what many would call terrorist methods.  Again, as you can well imagine, this brings up many philosophical questions.<br /><br />The art is adequate, though I wasn't a huge fan of it, but the dialogue and plot are exquisite, as is the tone and pacing.  Moore has gone on the record as saying he has not been happy with the film interpretations of his work, so much so, in fact, that he now refuses to have his name attached to them.  Let's hope that the film version of V for Vendetta pleases this modern day master of the graphic novel literary form.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]

B000002JK2|2.0|I bought this for the first song on the Cd - My Baby Gives It Away, which is great with Charlie Watts drumming away, but that's about it! The rest of it just sort sounds bland and plain boring. I love Pete, and Mr. Lane, but I guess not enough to recommend this whole CD.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist, to me, will remain the most scariest movie of all time, no other horror movie has been able to scare the sh.t out of me like the Exorcist. I think the Exorcist shows how it would really be like if someone was possessed by the devil. The Exorcist is so scary that I still can't watch it alone I always need to watch it with a group of friends, because of how scary it is. No other horror movie will be as scary as The Exorcist. My favorite quote from reagan is \\"Stick your c... up her a.., you motherf.....g worthless c... sucker\\" I can even say it the same as in the movie, just to scaresomeone or something. So The Exorcist will always be the most scariest f.....g movie of all time.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I admit, I was nervous for more than one reason when I entered the movie theater for HP 4.  This book was my long-standing favorite of the series (now tied with 6), so the film itself had quite some work to do in my opinion to do is justice.  However, I was also quite nervous for the soundtrack would not be done by John Williams, as the first three had.  I'd heard Patrick Doyle's work before, and knew I liked it, but the HP themes written by Williams are so much a part of the feel of HP (\\"Hedwig's Theme\\") that it wouldn't be the same without them.  And imagine my surprise when during the opening credits the hints of Williams' work were already there, \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" encorporated into it. Stylistically, HP 3's sountrack was a breakout success (think the amazing \\"Knight Bus\\" track); totally and completely different from the first 2 and now this one as well, but it was also a different kind of HP movie...the only one without a major touch of Voldemort for example.  However, in capturing the movie, Doyle has done a fantastic job.   The soundtrack begins, as I stated before with the opening credits, which contain Williams' \\"Hedwig's Theme\\", but is much darker than before, which sets the stage for the feel of the film immediately.  Not only that, but the fact that immediately following the credits, a death is witnessed, captured by \\"Frank Dies\\".  However, the tone quickly changes with the enticingly beautiful \\"The Quidditch World Cup,\\" with it's gorgeous strings and hauntingly deep percusion sections that make it one of the stand-out songs of the sountrack in my opinion.  In \\"Foreign Visitors Arrive\\" we hear more of \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" as well as the flowing string arrangements that signal the arrival of the foreign students to Hogwarts.  \\"Rita Skeeter\\" encapulates the sly, almost playful (but in a dasterdly annoying way) nature of the prying journalist that lends the track its name.  \\"Harry in Winter\\" is a moving piece which seems to have sucked into itself all of the brooding nature that has become a part of Harry now that the series has moved into the teen years.  \\"Death of Cedric,\\" however, is by far the most moving piece of the sountrack, with the ability to move a listener (including myself) to tears with no visuals or vocals at all.  \\"The Maze\\" captures the uncertainty and darkness that is soon to befall all four of the champions, and \\"Voldemort,\\" the longest piece of the soundtrack does an incredible job as the backdrop to the most anticipated, and somewhat feared, scene of the HP world, the return of Tom Riddle, Lord Voldemort.  After the se tracks, the soundtrack winds itself down with the typical moving, all encompassing pieces, \\"Another Year Ends\\" and \\"Hogwarts Hymn,\\" which must now do the job of fitting together all of the feelings and emotions that the moviegoer now feels having seen the entire movie (fear, sadness, angst, anticipation, etc) into something all its own.  The final three tracks are the Weird Sister songs played at the Yule Ball.  In my opinion they are a good example of the music that would be found at a dance for British teenagers (I am not one myself, but I have heard some of the British exports here in America, as well as reading on what the actors themselves listen to).  Also, in their quirkiness, the magical nature of the HP world is captured.  Why would the Wizarding World listen to just any old muggle music? <br />You'll find yourself getting lost in the music, the tracks blending together beautifully (this fact being helped by the Weird Sisters' tracks being placed at the end). <br />All in all, Patrick Doyle has given us a fantastic body of work worthy of being linked to this wonderful world and worthy of being heard outside of the movie itself as well.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|this has to be one of the most quoted movies ever, everyone from my boyfriend to my niece was quoting this movie.  However it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I was forced to sit through this at a firend's house.  I wouldn't recomend this movie.  Don't see it, if you don't have to.  There are so many better movies out there.
B000E1YVZU|3.0|Before I say anything, I should confess that I had never seen RENT on stage, and had only listened to snippets of a few songs. However, it was these snippets that convinced me that I had to see this movie; unfortunately, it was not playing in my hometown, but I was able to see it in the town over (about 45 minutes away) in a really good theatre. Now that's out of the way, what did I think? <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this movie doesn't come QUITE across the way that it was probably intended. Yes, the chilling doom of AIDS is effectively given (Probably the scariest image in the entire film is Mimi lying in a gutter, shivering because of her constant drug feed); however, the fact that Chris Columbus directed the film probably wasn't a hopeful omen to begin with; Chris Columbus will always film an adaptation as completely faithful to its source, and that's not always a good thing. <br /> <br />Really, the problems are a bit obvious, even when you're watching the film for the first time. While the actors give amazing performances (the newcomers [Rosario Dawson as Mimi and Tracie Thoms as Joanne] especially), they are now ten years older than when they originated the parts (except, of course, for the newcomers), and they just don't look the age that they're supposed to anymore. Now one could probably pass this off as saying that this is the effect that both drugs and living in New York in those years would have on anyone, but that just seems a bit packed to me (especially considering how hot Mimi is when, apparently, she's the most drugged character in the entire movie).  <br /> <br />Other big problems come with Columbus trying to make this film as faithful to the stage show as possible. By keeping so many of the events the way they are, and keeping almost every song (although, to his credit, he did cut a LOT of the filler music that made the show almost completely sung through), he essentially turns the film into nothing more than an excuse to sing song after song, with little cohesive narrative to push through. For instance, the whole funeral scene with (spoiler) probably could have been cut, with the film cutting straight to the graveyard. They didn't need to sing there.  In short, The film seems more like a stream of music videos than a film. <br /> <br />Thankfully, however, there is one thing (apart from the actors) that saves this movie, and that is the MUSIC. I myself was not impressed with most of the numbers when I saw the film, but I have since bought the 2-Disk CD, and have fallen in love with every single number. Jonathan Larson really wrote these numbers well, giving them the contemporary edge needed to win over those who might be wary of seeing a movie where people just SING their feelings. Also, this music has some of my favorite lyrics of all time, above anything I've ever heard before, like: <br /> <br />Ever since puberty/ <br />Everybody stares at me/ <br />Boys, girls, I can't help it, baby/ <br /> <br />Please take me/ <br />Out Tonight/ <br />Don't forsake me/ <br />Out Tonight/ <br />I'll let you make me <br />Out Tonight!/ <br /> <br />In short, the music in this musical probably ranks up to my second favorite musical score, beat only by the score of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera. <br /> <br />In the end, as the title suggests, you need to take this film for what it is: an incredibly faithful adaptation of a hit Broadway show that loses its way a few times. No more, no less.
0385338686|4.0|I loved this book.  There were parts of it especially the references to long hours etc that as a banking lawyer I could definately relate to even if parts of the story were unrealistic.  An entertaining book - great for a light read.
0553801503|2.0|I read the first three books in Martins saga. Even though he can painfully drag on with mondain discriptions of scenes. He at least had a interesting story to tell with colorful characters that you loved and hated. For some reason he has chosen to kill all the interesting characters leaving us with the left over characters to fight over a realm that is basically nothing. He ignores the Dragon Princess who is the only remaining character with any interest. I can't believe it took him so long to write this book. He should refund everyone who bought it.

The author includes interesting and pertinent stories from her experience as a Certified Animal Behaviorist as well as excellent recommendations for dealing with undesirable behavior using positive reinforment.

B00079ZACM|5.0|Many a time I saw the cover of this DVD; the faces of the 3 leading characters, notably the stunning beauty of June Duprez, and the rich colour of the film shots somehow misled me to think this as a modern movie.<br /><br />Finally I watched this 1939 classic - a breathtakingly beautiful film, both in terms of the cinematography and the natural flow of the plot. The combat scenes were real and visually capturing - they would not pale compared with its modern counterparts.<br /><br />To top it all, the story was simple and enchanting. Four feathers were given to Harry Faversham for his apparent cowardice to withdraw, in the last minute, from his regiment which was set to battle in Egypt. To prove his own worth, he would go to Egypt, disguise himself and did courageous deeds to these 4 people so that they would take the feathers back and reinstate his reputation and courage. This is a story about noble characters, not only for Harry but also for his fellow officers.<br /><br />What follows were as exciting as it was captivating. I like the ending most - the one courageous deed he did for his wife (the graceful June Duprez) proved to be the perfect comic twist for this otherwise heavy film. Highly recommend it!
1573223026|3.0|I didn't have much familiarity with Nick Hornby going into A Long Way Down except for an enjoyment of the movie version of About a Boy and knowledge of the cult surrounding works like High Fidelity.  I listened to the unabridged audio CD version of the book and found it to be enjoyable, but with a number of problems. <br /> <br />The story follows four people who come together on New Year's Eve at a popular suicide spot in London.  Obviously, all four of them mean to kill themselves, but meeting and seeing each other changes the courses of things and their lives begin to intertwine and go in unexpected directions.  The characters are diverse, from a punkish teenage girl to the prim mother of a handicapped child. <br /> <br />One of the things I like about Hornby's writing is the joyful way in which he has his characters interact.  This was perhaps the most rewarding part of this book.  I liked the relationships all four formed with each other, how they talked to one another, and how their feelings were expressed.  As well, I liked how the plot was laid out, jumping from perspective to perspective as it progressed along, without too much recapping and over-explanation. <br /> <br />Hornby often uses improbable events and wildly contrary characters and sometimes it works quite well.  However, in A Long Way Down, it grew to be too much.  I could accept the different nature of the characters, and even the fact that Martin was a disgraced talk show host.  (And JJ was a rock-and-roll American.)  But when Jess turned out to be the daughter of a Cabinet Minister... and then the plot took a ludicrous turn into the media... and then more inexplicable twists and turns.  Well, it all got to be too much, it felt more like these events were helping to push the plot along rather than organically being a part of the plot itself. <br /> <br />As for Hornby's meditations on suicide and soldiering on with life, well, I will give him credit for not going down the stereotypical route, for showing that it's not easy and everything doesn't turn up rosy even if you don't want to kill yourself anymore.  But none of this felt very deep to me.  As much as I understood the characters' situations, I didn't feel them, I didn't feel their desperation and their reasons, I didn't see the emotion behind the decision. <br /> <br />Despite all that, and despite the lower rating, I would still recommend this book if you liked Hornby's other novels.  It was entertaining and did give me a good laugh or two. <br />
0887307280|4.0|Well som ewould disagree with me, but I think this book is absolutly breakthrough in changing most business owners paradigm of what a business should be........ I beleive he is right that you need to set your business up as a system that runs whether the founder is present or not. Most people would say this isn't likeley or possible well heres a short list of businesses who have successfully utilized this concept that Gerber talks about in this book, which is developing a business into something that is essentially on \\"auto- pilot\\" heres a few of them <br />Starbucks, Supercuts, DelTaco, McDonalds, ReMax, Staples, HomeDepot, BestBuy, Payless, Kmart, WalMart, Macoroni Grill, Wendys, Burger King, Albertson's, Dairy Queen, Men's Wharehouse, Costco, Domino's, GNC, there's many many of these companies that are chains that are run by networks of manegemnt through out the country........... and I don't know about you but I have never walked into a Starbuck's and seen Howard Shultz serving coffee behind the counter nor has George Zimer fitted me for a suit when I walked into a Men's Wharehouse..... so obviously Michale Gerber has a point here and I beleive the book is worth reading and implementing the strategies he describes also.....

B0006L16N8|5.0|Okay, first things first. Coldplay did not steal the riff in \\"Talk\\"  from Kraftwerk's \\"Computer Love\\". They sampled it, and if you read the liner notes you can see they give them credit. Meaning Kraftwerk is getting paid royalties. Meaning they okayed it with the band. Meaning people need to calm down. As such I think \\"Talk\\" is a great song. But I digress...    I quite enjoy \\"X&Y\\", but there are some problems with it. The first is that it seems like they really tried this time, there's nothing wrong with trying but in some situations it feels a little forced. I'm going to assume it stems from the pressure of trying to follow up \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" and \\"Parachutes\\". Also, at times the songs seem too formulatic (\\"Fix You\\" is a prime example -- But I should add it's still a great song). And at other times it feels like they're trying to go for the \\"big band\\" sound a little too often. The first part of the record is pretty much dedicated to the big band sound, and it gives the illusion that the softer, more acoustic Coldplay has been lost. However, they do return to that sound starting with \\"A Message\\".    All in all though, I would still recommend this album. Is it as good as their previous efforts? That's up to you. But you can't knock a band for trying to do something different with their sound.
0307276902|1.0|First, this book sucks, and like millions of readers that read quality material, we know a good read! This is not one of them!!! <br /> <br />Anyone here notice, as soon as there is a 1 star review, a 5 star follows? That's cause, their is a team of them, probably hired by the writer to keep the ratings up. Like others, I feel robbed of precious time, and of my 12 bucks. I got the book on sale. This is no surprise to me at all: <br /> <br />In class-action suits filed in Manhattan Monday, publishers Random House and Nan Talese are being accused of gross negligence for their role in James Frey's embattled memoir A Million Little Pieces - or rather, for their failure to act properly and fact-check Frey's reputed \\"brutally honest\\" account of his alcohol- and drug addictions.  <br /> <br />This includes Frey's published claim that he spent 87 days in jail, a report since exposed - first by the Smoking Gun Web site, then by Frey himself when confronted by Oprah Winfrey last Thursday - as a lie.  <br /> <br />\\"All they had to do was call the Department of Corrections to verify that this guy was never in jail,\\" Alan Ripka, attorney for plaintiffs Jimmy Floyd and Susan Gardiner, tells New York's Daily News.  <br /> <br />But theirs is not the only suit. Social worker Jennifer Cohn is seeking $10 million on behalf of consumers she claims were injured by Frey's lies after she recommended the book to those with substance-abuse problems because of its \\"redemptive theme,\\" says the Daily News.  <br /> <br />Other such suits have been filed by disgruntled readers in Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles.  <br /> <br />Interesting?
B00005JOFO|5.0|The story itself is quite a journey, and if you can open your heart and empathize just a tiny bit you'll find it both devistating and captivating. <br /> <br />But beyond the story itself, this movie has so many layers of meaning and subtlety that Ang Lee and the incredible cast have added to the amazing screenplay.  I cannot recommend this movie enough!
B000A6T262|5.0|It's worth to buy for such price!
B00024YVJU|5.0|This was the first Eloy album I listened to when I was quite young, and I was hooked from the very start.  Certainly Eloy has become one of my all-time favourite prog-rock bands and one of the few that continued to make high quality rock in the 80's and 90's. <br /> <br />Ocean must be, however, one of the most beautiful and crafted works.  The four songs are inmediate Eloy classics as they portray the very spirit of its music.  This is the second album with, arguably, Eloy's best line up: Frank Bornemann on vocals and guitars, Klaus Peter Matziol on bass, Jurgen Rosenthal on Drums, percs and flute (he also wrote the lyrics based on Frank's story) and Detlev Schimdtchen on Keyboards & synths. <br /> <br />First track, Poseidon's Creation, is one of the few tracks from this period that Eloy still plays live.  This is the \\"classic song\\" of the album.  The first 4:30 minutes are instrumental, pumping rhythm section, solid keyboard work and a twin guitar solo.  Then the song slows down its tempo and Frank sings all the lyrics leading to a typical Eloy keyboard solo and another great guitar solo by Frank.  Before the song finishes a choir can be heard adding some really majestic atmosphere to the finale. <br /> <br />Incarnation of Logos starts very atmospheric and it seems nothing happens until the band kicks in after 4 minutes.  Again Klaus bassplaying shines (actually it shines throughout the whole album) providing dynamic and rhythm to Detlev's keyboard work.  The main melody repeats itself until Frank sings a couple of verses.  The song ends fading out, which is really a shame cause it could have well ended in other way. <br /> <br />Decay of Logos, the third song, starts very atmospheric too, but this time, bass and drums give the song a different feel.  Halfway through the song the band picks up the tempo and the song evolves towards the heaviest track on the album.  There's also a great synth solo over rhythm section changes that really drives the song.  Then themain melody is repeated and the song finished. <br /> <br />Last track, Atlantis Agony at June Five 8498 Gregorian Earthtime, is the most enigmatic yet amazing song of the whole record.  It clocks around 15:30.  The first eight minutes could be described as a musical tour de force that blows any Pink Floyd  comparison away.  Very spacey, atmospheric and with some Tangerine Dream touches.  After eight minutes the band kicks in in mid tempo where Frank sings most of the lyrics.  The band keeps the tempo for a couple of minutes more providing space for some incredible keyboard solos.  When the song seems to be ending the band picks up the fastest tempo of the album.  Fantastic Bass playing and drumming, powerful and dynamic. Keyboards and Guitars provide the main melody, which is superb. <br /> <br />The story and lyrics deal with Atlantis' rise and fall and are based in some texts by Plato.  Production-wise, this must be one of Eloy's worst sounding recordings, unfortunately.  However, the remastered edition does some good to the overall sound.  If you can live with that, you should definitely check this out.  The music lives to prog-rock expectations and in many places exceeds them.  This is comparable to Genesis and Yes masterpieces.
0385507755|1.0|I bought this book to read on a flight - and it was one of the longest flight's I've ever taken.  The writing style was difficult to get used to, but I finally did.  However, his recollections were not very believable, and come to find out - they were all lies.  While I appreciate this is a good story (and I emphasize story, because it's all fiction) about addiction, it is dangerous to embrace lies as \\"who cares because it's a good story about addiction.\\"  It's as good a story about addiction as Bambi is a National Geographic special on deer - they're both made up and have no correlation to reality, and his story is made up - there's no reality about addiction in it.  Therein lies the danger - that people will believe his story is true and act accordingly.
0385507755|4.0|I thought that A Million Little Pieces by James Frey was a very well written book. I mean I know that he might have rearranged (to put it nicely) some words and fibbed on some other stuff too, but at least he was brave enough to talk about what he went through and share it with others too. I did not like that he had exaggerated stuff and then said that it was all-true when it really was not. Yes he did put some fiction in to his \\"non-fiction\\" book but that was only to get the publishers to accept it.  Not that many people would talk about their road to recovery from addiction of crack, and heroin and crap like that. What I also did not think was very good of him was that not that many people that are addicted do not really like remember all the pain that he went through or all the food that he supposedly ate so I mean come on so what if he had embellished some of the stuff we thought were true. I mean does not people believe in forgive and forget nowadays?  I personally did get mad but I was not to the extreme like Oprah was. Yeah she did recommend the book, but I think that is ridiculous. Frey went through a lot of pain that was probably very excruciating, he was just trying to do good to tell people about what had happened and hoped that by doing writing this book he could hopefully try and get other young people to not do what he did so they would not have to go through what he went through in his life. James Frey is not necessarily my hero but I do think that what he did is a very brave thing.
B0000640VO|5.0|A delightful movie; sweet and fun.  I always smile when I think of this film.  It is true, though, that you must be ready for a little silliness and effervescent fun.  It is NOT a serious film, so you must enter into it with the right mindset to enjoy it.  Be prepared to not take it too seriously.  Just enjoy it.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This is a CD that has stayed in my player for several days. It is refreshing, calming, and uplifting. Enya's style has you excited, but is relaxing enough to face another drudging day. This CD is infused with Celtic-style chants which provide a haunting harmony. The way her voice fluctuates provides almost a visual melody. I have several of her works, but I believe this to be the best thus far.
B00005G95I|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect when I bought this (on vinyl, in 1987), I saw the video of \\"Learning To Fly,\\" and even though it was a good song, and it was well played, it was so cluttered looking and sounding, as I have been a hard-core fan of this band for many, MANY years, I was used to the four-piece band. Yes, \\"The Wall\\" had many extra people involved, but that was all a part of the concept of alienation, as well as the first overt signs that there was trouble in paradise. But, understanding that Water's grim song cycles and near total control of the band in the late 1970's and early 1980's, sort of soured the other band members' attitudes toward the band, this was a breath of fresh air. So, with a little trepidation, I went to Hills (the store that eventually became Ames), and bought my own copy.<br /><br />\\"Signs Of Life\\" set a mood of anticipation, and looking at the really beautiful packaging, I felt I had made a wise purchase. I felt a little cheated, though, because the so-called \\"band photo\\" consisted only of David Gilmour and Nick Mason, standing back-to-back, in what looked like Preppy clothes, smiling at the camera, looking more like business partners, not band mates. And knowing that Mason was, at the time only a figurehead, long out of practice, most of the drum tracks were played, in fact, by Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner, sort of put me in another place. And with Rick Wright listed in small print as a session player instead of a band member, a saxophone player and two drummers, as well as a rhythm guitarist and various back-up singers all listed, there's a side of me that says \\"This is not Pink Floyd at all!\\" And with Tony Levin of King Crimson on bass, good a musician as he is (I love King Crimson, by the way), I just thought I wouldn't like this at all. \\"Learning To Fly\\" followed, and since I had already heard that song, I just kind of sat through it. \\"Dogs Of War\\" had some cheezy lyrics, I wasn't sold yet, so when \\"One Slip\\" came on, I thought \\"This is King Crimson, featuring David Gilmour;\\" that kind of bass playing has never been part of Floyd's sound, but \\"On The Turning Away\\" came on, and reassured me, I had made a wise purchase. So powerful sounding. Beautiful production, and a guitar solo in the same league as \\"Comfortably Numb.\\"<br /><br />I flipped the record over (this was the '80's, mind you), and \\"Yet Another Movie\\" leapt out of my stereo with that MASSIVE sound, all the ornate arrangements and sound effects in the mix, I thought \\"OK, Gilmour has just sold me; this is a fantastic comeback!\\" At first, I didn't know \\"Round And Around\\" was a coda to \\"Movie,\\" but it is a really good outro, the mind's eye watching this behemoth lumber off into the horizon, setting the listener up for \\"A New Machine, part one.\\" A little brief, and not what I, as a Floyd fan, am used to in a Floyd record, but I enjoyed the oscillation of Gilmour's voice, and the way the piece sets the mood for \\"Terminal Frost.\\" As the first reviewer said, the arrangement, and overall sound, are chill-inducing. A mood piece, it's an instrumental that would probably be ruined with words. It's just fine as it is. So, along comes part two of \\"A New Machine, bookending \\"Frost,\\" so you are now all set for the closer, \\"Sorrow.\\" This sounds like the old days, moderately slow, mechanical rhythm, and it just flows from the speakers to fill the room with power, and trademark Gilmour solos throughout. Come the fade-out, and there you have it. Pink Floyd, but not really Pink Floyd, playing a Pink Floyd record to a skeptical audience, myself included, and Waters' comments notwithstanding, this is an exceptionally good record, especially when you consider the time it came out, when most popular music was just a shell of it's former self, and with Waters' departure, the had band lost a phenominally talented lyricist and conceptualist. I didn't think they'd be able to do it, but, as I said, one listen, and I don't regret buying it. And I don't think most other people will, either.people will, either.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon created a series that is at once brilliantly humorous and poignant, with elements of classic westerns and SciFi. Had it aired on the Fox Network of the 80's and early 90's it would have had a longer run, but that bunch have turned into corporate weasels and are not willing to let a show find an audience. I didn't see it on the original run on fox, but thanks to the SciFi channel I had the opportunity to view the series and become a \\"Browncoat.\\" This boxed set contains all episodes including three that never aired on Fox. This set is well worth the investment and I highly recommend you join the fun!
B000AWYOGE|2.0|Jennifer Connelly plays a woman who is going through a bitter divorce and she and her young daughter must find a new place to live. They rent an apartment in a kind of dank, run-down building. There are continuous leaks of dark water from the apartment above and also strange noises. The daughter becomes obsessive over an imaginary friend that has something to do with the apartment upstairs. It turns out there was a little girl who lived there who disappeared a few weeks earlier and no one knows what happened to her. It all ties in with Connelly's issues with her own mother and she begins to wonder if she is going crazy. The water leaks are blamed on a few teenagers that live in the building and Connelly sees her husband talking to these boys. She wonders if he is paying them to mess with her to help in the custody fight. <br /> <br />The movie does make you wonder if the things that are happening are supernatural or a set-up and it is a stylish movie to look at. The performances are also first-rate. However, the movie ultimately fails because except for last ten minutes, and one creepy scene in particular, there is no tension or fear. Things happen at a very slow pace and there isn't anything frightening about them for the viewer. The first hour and a half of the movie are dull and it does not build, it just sits there. I love the scene at the end when the daughter is in the bathtub and the mother finally realizes exactly what's happening but it's too little too late to save the movie as a whole.
B00004VXF2|3.0|The story I know behind this album was that Lou Reed had to put out an album for contractual reasons, but he didn't want to, so he recorded about an hour of guitar feedback, packaged it, and sold it to the masses.  In doing this, he created one of the greatest debates in modern \\"experimental\\" music history.  Is this music? art? great? awful? and is it supposed to be taken seriously?? <br />There is never going to be a final answer to these questions.  It is truly left to the eye of the beholder.  There is nothing melodic about MMM, it is simply guitar feedback going between speakers, in, out and around the preamps and speakers.  So those who maintain it is not music, and thereby, crap, are perfectly correct.  Conversely, those who see it for its artistic attitude will delight in it's blatant \\"F&%k You\\" to the music industry and its fans.  Additionally, those looking for some good noise to ingest chemicals with or just to hang out and have some sound in the background, this will be perfect for some, and painfully inadequate for others. <br />The fact is, this is about as controversial as music gets.  There are no right or wrong answers, and both sides have their equal merits - which is why this album is important.  Buy it if you're curious, or if you have heard a 30 second sample and think that an hour of it can be useful.  Most importantly, be open-minded, and debate MMM with your music-snob friends.  That is why this album was made, and that is why it is still around.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|The Lord of War tracks the adult life of a Russian immigrant, Yuri Orlov, played by Nicholas Cage. To get out of his crappy life in Little Odessa, he begins selling guns to local mobsters. His business becomes larger and larger until he is the top gun runner in the world, besting a rival who had looked down on him. When communism falls in the Ukraine, he goes to see his uncle who is a Colonel in the Red army. Together they sell Russian guns, tanks, helicopters and missiles because the government is in such disarray no one is watching. <br /> <br />Along the way, Orlov marries his dreamgirl, a model and struggles to help his brother stay clean of drugs and alcohol. The wife knows her husband isn't on the up and up but doesn't want to know because she says she doesn't want him to lie to her. In the end, when she finds everything out and leaves him, it's hard to have a lot of sympathy for her. Ethan Hawke plays a Javert-like Interpol agent trying desperately to put Yuri away. He knows he's guilty but can never get the proof he needs. <br /> <br />This was a very well-made film. All the performances are top grade and it's a beautiful movie to look at. There is an undercurrent of very black humor throughout a serious story. The end result of what happens with all the weapons that are bought is shown bluntly and can be quite jarring. Cage does a good job playing a man fighting with the immorality of what he does while knowing, as he says in the movie, that he's good at it, and if he quits, someone else will take his place tomorrow. There are missteps along the way; a few plot points you'll see coming before they happen and some of the music choices were too obvious, but overall this was a very good movie.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I bought this movie without seeing it because I'm not one to dislike many movies - actually, my friends like to say that I am a big collector of bad movies.  This is one bad movie that I am going to have to agree with my friends on that I have added to my collection.  This movie was that aweful that I am probably going to try and sell it on Ebay for whatever amount possible.  The acting was terrible and the cheezey lines were even worse.  This movie isn't worth the dust that's been collecting on it...
B0000CABBW|2.0|02/01/06  The basic of the story \\"Whale Rider\\" would be most appealing to those intrigued by cinematograpy..the story line about the \\"long line of male descendants\\" to the original \\"leader\\" washed up on the shores thanks to his ride on a whale\\" and thus becoming the New Zealand indigenous peoples\\"s leader finally ending with a girl , and how girls can \\"mentally & physically equal boys\\" , so why not \\"a Woman Leader\\" ends how you would have expected to end & gives a few suspense filled moments .
B000301YY8|5.0|First, let me say that I made a HUGE mistake when I judged this guy by the 30-sec clips. One, they don't do justice to the songs. Two, they're an unfair representation of his voice. Yes, it is different. But it sounds WAY better than the clips led me to believe. I tried to listen to his sessions on AOL Music, but for some reason they wouldn't work on my computer. Luckily, I had just purchased an MP3 player with an FM radio. I heard \\"You're Beautiful\\" and was immediately taken back by how good this song sounded in its entirety. This song is at its strongest in the closing lines when he says: <br /> <br />\\"There must be an angel with a smile on her face, <br />When she thought up that I should be with you. <br />But it's time to face the truth, <br />I will never be with you.\\"  <br /> <br />I was also impressed because James' unique voice sounded quite stellar. His voice is very good. The perfect example is with the song \\"No Bravery,\\" my personal favorite. The real beauty and texture of his voice really come out on this song during the chorus: <br /> <br />\\"And I see no bravery, <br />No bravery in your eyes anymore. <br />Only sadness.\\"  <br /> <br />At that moment, I really take this song to heart. I think this is the real standout on the album. It's the perfect way to end everything. But this has to be one of the most interesting and original albums by a new artist in years. He'll be an interesting artist to watch. James Blunt has a lot of potential. I think every song on the album is good. I would take the time and listen to his album in its entirety before completely dismissing him. Don't make the same mistake I did. \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is a CD worth keeping around.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I have read many of the reviews posted here and I agree with alot of it. I haven't been captivated by the last few DT albums the way that Images & Words and Awake did, and of course \\"Scenes...\\" stands on its own, they have not topped that monster yet. But Octavarium is right up there, it's an amazing journey through every corner of the prog rock universe. However, some of you seem to be missing the point on one particular track. \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is NOT a slam on the Bush administration, at least I fail to see how it could be. It is also not merely about \\"war\\". That's far too general a term. Read the lyrics. 9/11. The shock, grief, anger, and horror of that day is spelled out in the words and soaring melody, especially in the chorus. \\"Who would wish this on our people...\\" It strips away all the political hoohah and leaves us asking the most important question. Why?
0440178002|5.0|I never wanted the book to end.  It is a story of love, hate, honor, shame, war, religious conflict, cultural divides, tenderness, brutality, loss, loyalty, treachery, victory and hope.  Clavell weaves it all in a most gripping story.  The full 1982 miniseries is available on DVD also and will make you want to get the book for the full impact.
B00003CWPL|5.0|David Lynch's first feature-length film is a truly original work of art. There is simply no other movie that is remotely like Eraserhead. The plot is simple enough; a mutant baby is born to an unwed couple in a post-apocalyptic industrial dreamscape. The ensuing events and details that unfold defy any paltry explanation I could give. Suffice to say, the viewer is in for a wildly surreal ride (or multiple rides; I can't count the number of times I've watched it).<br /><br />Jack Nance delivers a performance that is right on key and somehow lends credibility to the surrounding nightmarish circumstances. He conveys a great deal without words, which is good, since dialogue is exceedingly sparse. It's unfortunate that after this film Nance was mainly relegated to supporting roles.<br /><br />David Lynch worked on this film for five years, an amount of time that enabled him to achieve a level of perfection that has been realized in only a handful of movies. I only regret that I can't give it more than five stars.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This is a well-filmed, well-acted adaptation of P&P.  I'm not going to compare it to the '95 A&E version because this is a 2 hour and 10 minute (or so) version and there are things that couldn't be included, unlike the lengthy '95 P&P.  Keira Knightley did a wonderful job of playing a rather elfin Elizabeth Bennet.  I especially enjoyed her lifted eyebrow as she taunted Darcy.  She represents a youthful Elizabeth Bennet and her youth was a refreshing touch to the character.  Matthew Macfadyen does a good job brooding his way through most of the movie as Mr. Darcy, but he does look a bit silly when he is allowed to show his feelings toward Miss Bennet later in the film. He goes all mushy! (Stick with the glowering, Matthew!)  One of the best touches to the set was that the Bennet's house was surrounded by livestock, dirt, and everyday activities.  It made for a great contrast to Mr. Darcy's home with it's immaculate grounds and perfect furnishings.  This was a wonderful movie, though too short to do full justice to the story.  I will be buying it and I recommend it to any Pride & Prejudice fan.
B0009R1T7M|1.0|I must admit I am a big fan of Sufjan's Seven Swans.  Since then, he has expanded his music, and I can definitely accept that fact.  However, this CD is as overproduced and overwritten as any I have heard in a long time.  I too can hear some Pet Sounds, or maybe a little Sgt Pepper influence, but it seems like he is trying too hard to make an epic-sounding album, and ends up turning out a lot of clutter.  I know that Sufjan may not completely turn back to his \\"folkier ways\\", and I am not stubborn enough to hold that against him. I sense that a lot of people will buy this album thinking that, because the titles are long, and the work is \\"complicated\\", they are buying something only understood by the enlightened few.  The bottom line, to me, is that Sufjan is trying way too hard on this CD.  I wish he knew that he doesn't have to try to be the offspring of Phil Spector and Brian Wilson to be seen as a wonderful songwriter.
0739308742|3.0|(Note from the author: Please don't write this review off as another bash-fest. It, like the book it reviews, gets better towards the end.) <br /> <br />GRRM's first three books, as just about everyone seems to agree, are some of the best, if not THE best, in fantasy fiction. If this fourth book had been written by any other author, it might have received 4 or 5 stars, but we've all come to expect more from the best fantasy author since Tolkien (or perhaps including him!).  <br /> <br />The book focuses on hitherto minor characters and launches all new plot lines, rarely picking up ones from the previous books. I think it's this near-total disconnect from the previous books, where the first three were so tightly-bound, that's causing most of the frustration. Yes, GRRM does focus on minutae, but honestly, he always did. It's just that we LOVED it when he described the ferocious ranks of lion-tabarded armies, etc, etc... when he's describing the arms of house Hyle, well, our attention wanders. <br /> <br />Also, the characters are not nearly as dynamic. As one other reviewer mentioned, the thing that made us love the previous characters was their \\"gray\\"ness. Tyrion has a huge heart, yet he can scheme and connive with the best of them. Catelyn was a brave and loving woman, yet her weakness where Jon was concerned was unnerving. And Jaime... well, go read book 3. :) <br /> <br />These new POVs are much less malleable. Brienne, while likeable, is predictably courageous, yet shy. Cersei is predictably nasty and power-mad. And Arya... well, what the heck is going on there? She's turned into a caricature; it's like a thin backstory for some superhero. The Ironmen might as well be one character; they're all almost exactly alike, and they apparently are required by Pyke law to end every other sentence with bad Neitzche paraphrases. The only goood thing about them is that they all but disappear about halfway through the book. Plus, maddeningly, GRRM takes the POV chapter titles and changes character names; if it's Victarion, dangit, title it Victarion, not \\"The Iron Captain.\\" It seems to be meant to give us a clue as to how the characters currently view themselves, but it's a weak gimmick. In the first three books, such revelations were made within the chapters themselves. <br /> <br />So why give it 3 stars if I have nothing good to say about it? Well, the thing is, about 3/4 of the the way through the book, it starts to pick up pace. By the end, it's almost back to the plateau reached by the previous three books. The shocking plot twists and cliffhanger chapter endings return. The chapters contain real action instead of meandering descriptions. Some old friends from the previous books return to the fray. And, most hopeful of all, the bonus chapter from the upcoming Dance with Dragons (mercifully titled \\"Danaerys\\" and not \\"Mother of All Dragons\\" or \\"She Who Was Born in Flame\\") is chock full of promise. So, even though parts of the book may remind some of the painful fantasy marathons created by other authors (*cough* Jordan *cough*), where readers seem to only be buying the books to prove to the world they can endure them to the end, it does get better.  <br /> <br />Don't give up, GRRM fanatics! The author we all love has not disappeared; he only lost his way for a short while...
0307276902|1.0|I bought this book because my gf loves oprah and usually wants to read the books she comes out with on her book club (if she hasn't already). She found the book \\"ok\\" before the word got out about the authors lies. I read a few chapters while sitting on the can and like many others, did not understand what all the hype was about. The book is not a terrible read, but certainly not the best thing you'll ever read. I stopped reading after I found out that he lied (and in the process, make himself a multi-millionaire), and what seemed like a so-so account of drug addiction was shown to be an egocentric build up of a man who thought too much of himself.

B000BM3ZUE|4.0|Is this actually re-mastered? I realize that it is repackaged, but afaict, it is not actually remastered in the 'true' sense of the word, from earlier/better tapes than the currently available 'standard version'. Anyone know definitively? Thank you.
B0002IQJUK|3.0|Is The fisrt time i've listen something about DeGraw and i like a lot the melody of the CD including the variations in the Stripped one, but there is one thing that disappointed me and was the letter of the songs, i think these were too simple, i mean instead of Matt Nathanson or John Mayer. But in general, it doesn't dislike me.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|come on people sure its the return of the original and best bond but he was way past his prime even in diamonds are forever..and there isnt no fight scene or gun battle at the end but a video game battle wtf is that..this isnt an offical bond film and it shows..

B0002UOK04|5.0|This is by far the best album by the best artist I have ever heard. It's passionate moving and as unstopable as blizzard, while as majestic as the cold north itself. This band and their debut album truly are the winters sun.
0679720200|2.0|I didn't know it at the time this was assigned to me, but I was bound to hate this book.  Correctly called an existentialist masterpiece, the book runs in circles.  You cannot identify with this character because he is so detached from his existence.  The only 'moral lesson' to be had seems to say that existence has no objective meaning, only that which you give it (an existentialist tenet) and if you give it no meaning, it doesn't matter any way (point of the book). <br /> <br />As an Objectivist, I just can't identify with or support that in any way.  The book gets 2 stars because Camus' use of language is wonderful, but it is a talent wasted on a pointless book.  If you want to read a book with purpose instead, pick up Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.  Although her use of language is not as fluid, the themes of her books make much more sense.

B000BGH22W|5.0|This is one of the best Harry Potter soundtracks so far.  I love it.  My favorite song is #3-Quidditch World Cup.  I love the Irish and Bulgarian sounds.  The waltzes are so pretty.  I can just imagine the students dancing while I listen to them.  This CD is definitely worth getting.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I've been gradually replacing favorite LPs with CDs and naturally some do not pass the test of time.  As a college student I more or less wore Live At Leeds white, until the grooves were gone. The CD is actually better than the original. Young Man Blues, Substitute, Summertime Blues, and Shakin' All Over pretty much define everything that live rock ought to be but seldom is.  And there is lots more material on here than the original.  I Can't Explain and I'm A Boy are standouts, although all are good.  Particularly nice that the stage announcements have been left in, gives that \\"you are there\\" concert feel.  Very noticeable how everybody contributes. Moon was a mind-boggling drummer, Daltrey does the rock-idol thing well, Entwistle is every bit as athletic as Jack Bruce, and what can you say about Townshend - it sounds like there are three guitarists in this group! If you loved it then you'll love it now.  If this is new territory for you, you might want to hear who half of the post-1980 rockers stole their act from.
0307276902|5.0|Even after all the hype this book is truly AMAZING! From start to finish I was captivated- I cried, I laughed and I developed such an intense relationship with each vivid character. I would give anything to meet James and tell him that I could care less if parts were 'embellished' or completely untrue. This book gave me a greater appreciation for my own life and opened my eyes to how good I really have it. THANK YOU, JAMES!  <br /> <br />As for Oprah....GET A LIFE! What a shame that such a powerful woman would have a staff full of idiots. If the morons at Smoking Gun could come up with 'the truth' I'm sure Oprah's sharp staff could have done the same. It's obvious she wants to blame James for her incompetence. I'm no longer an Oprah fan, in fact, I hate her. <br />
0553801503|3.0|I agree with what some of what has beensaid about this book. Unfortunately it is filled with POVs of some of the more uninteresting characters in the series: Brienne of Tarth comes to mind here. Cersei, Jamie, and Arya are the most enjoyable parts of the book, Cersei more than anyone else. I used to really want to know what she was thinking when reading the past three books.  I can't wait for the other half of this book to be published! I miss Daenarys, Catelyn, Berric, and, last but not least, Tyrion! There are some interesting things that Martin clues us in on, a little back story and background of what were some of the more peripheral characters in the other books. But sadly I find myself wanting to get through this book quickly, whereas with the other three, I wanted them to never end. I'm reading this because I have to more than anything else. What I really want to read now is The Hedge Knight, which we hear a little about in this book from Maester Aemon. Of course, I will stay faithful and wait for the next installment. I think there are very few writers who have the control and skill to juggle as many characters as tightly as Martin does. Even in this book, he doesn't lose control. I think that he just gets carried away in some minutiae, which is not the norm for the other three books. It has to be read, though, so don't skip it!
B0007PAMR4|1.0|This will be the shortest review I write for Amazon.  The only reason to buy this DVD is for the deleted scenes and the special features.  If you believe this to be the seminal Dune movie, then hit the back button.  If you believe the Sci Fi Channel Dune and Children of Dune mini series were far more true-to-the-book than the theatrical or extended version of the De Laurentis movie, then you will see why the former fell flat. The deleted scenes are so powerful and evocative of the book and it was a shame they weren't incorporated into the movie.  Even the long and somewhat choppy Princess Irulan intro was refreshing. <br /> <br />Buy it for the deleted footage, trust me. <br /> <br />
B000BI0WOA|5.0|One of the greatest folk ballads I have ever heard is \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\". Knopfler gets a strong assist from James Taylor on this very clever tune. For over twenty years I have enjoyed the Knopfler/Straits stuff that made it to the radio. This album shows me how truly underrated MK is. This guy is a real A-list star! Not only is he a phenomenal guitarist with a rumbler of a voice, he is also a wonderfully witty lyricist. Buy it, you won't regret it.
B000001EL3|5.0|Whenever a non-KISS fan asks me which KISS album to buy first, I say, \\"Destroyer.\\" It's not the hardest, not the poppiest, but it is definitive KISS. Songs like \\"God of Thunder\\" and \\"Detroit Rock City\\" sound contemporary all these years later. Destroyer was a departure from previous KISS albums, but remained true to the heavy metal roots of the group. As with all KISS albums, the music showed that heavy metal could be joyful. From the top 40 hit \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" to the more obscure \\"Great Expectations,\\" I could listen to this CD over and over.
B00005JOFO|5.0|BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has been described as \\"a gay love story.\\"  It is true that the story concerns an on-going relationship between two men, but this is merely the pebble director Ang Lee throws into the pond; the film itself is about the ripples the stone makes, and by examining them in meticulous fashion BROKEBACK creates a portrait of the way human beings are distorted by both external and self-imposed repression.  It is a powerful film, an artful film.  It is also one of the most painful films I have seen, the sort of film from which you emerge with a stunned sensation, and a film that lingers in your mind for a very long time afterward.<br /><br />In terms of plot the movie begins simply enough.  Two ranch hands, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), are hired to tend sheep on Brokeback Mountain in the summer of 1963.  Ennis is a very self-contained man.  Jack is more outgoing and is presented, in a relatively subtle way, as a man who is open to sexual possibilities.  As the summer progresses they become friends, and as Ennis opens up emotionally the two suddenly begin a sexual relationship.  Although they are careful to tell each other that they are not gay, and although the words \\"I love you\\" never cross their lips, the relationship develops into a romantic one.  But all summers must end.  The two men, struggling with emotions they are \\"not supposed to have\\" for each other, leave the mountain and each other.  Both men marry; both have children; both go on with their lives.<br /><br />But the stone makes ripples in the pond.  Ennis, more so than Jack, is utterly unable to accept the idea that he is homosexual--and yet when Jack seeks him out several years later it is Ennis who leaps at Jack both sexually and emotionally, and what began as a seemingly transient affair rapidly develops into an overpowering relationship that they must conceal from wives, children, and society--and the consequences of concealment are devastating for all concerned.  This is particularly true of Ennis, who has few internal resources, who is more afraid of social retribution, and who can neither let go of Jack nor bring himself to agree that they can live discreetly together.  The result is a series of internal tragedies, failures, losses, and frustrations, all of which create a deep and abiding pain from which there is no escape.<br /><br />In terms of art, the film is beautifully crafted.  Director Ang Lee approaches his material with a sparse grace and an eye for the telling detail, presenting the characters in such a manner as to allow you see them in the fullest possible way.  He is greatly assisted in this by the remarkably powerful script by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, which translates Annie Proulx's memorable short story to the screen in both brilliant recreation and illumination, and by Rodrigo Prieto's simple yet compelling cinematography.  The cast is fine beyond all possible expectation, never sounding a false note, and we believe them from start to finish.  Nothing is either overplayed or underplayed; there is no artificially heightened drama; no manufactured element any kind.  Indeed, with the single exception of an occasional make-up effect, it is virtually impossible to fault the film on any level.  Is it a great masterpiece?  I think it may well be.  Time will tell.<br /><br />The film has been controversial on several fronts, but most particularly for the homosexual relationship that forms the spine of the plot.  Some critics have seen this as evidence of \\"Hollywood's leftist agenda;\\" others have stated that the film is the best possible argument for same sex marriage.  To adopt these attitudes, however, is to impose ideas on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN that do not actually exist in the film.  It is a rare example of a film that does not tell you what to think; it simply presents a story of what things were like, and in some respects are still like, for gay men and their families in America.  It leaves you to make your ownjudgement about right, wrong, and where sympathy should reside.<br /><br />In closing, I will make an cautionary observation: while I strongly recommend the film, I must note that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN will likely take a toll on many gay viewers akin to the toll taken by PLATOON on Vietnam vets.  I think this will be particularly true of gay men from largely rural and small town backgrounds and who are presently in their forties or older.  It is profoundly painful to see elements of your life undergo this sort of extremely public autopsy, and had I realized the accuracy of the film I might well have elected to wait for a release to the home market.  Having said this, I also note that in a visual sense BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN really requires the breadth of a movie screen, and I do recommend that it be seen in that format if at all possible.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweryour own judgement about right, wrong, and where sympathy should reside. <br /> <br />In closing, I will make an cautionary observation: while I strongly recommend the film, I must note that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN will likely take a toll on many gay viewers akin to the toll taken by PLATOON on Vietnam vets.

B000002MUN|5.0|I first became a Tom Petty fan when I heard the \\"Full Moon Fever\\" album which I really enjoyed.  Based on the strength of that album, I decided to get this one when it came out.  I was immediately struck by how different it was from the previous album but I wasn't disappointed as from the moment \\"Wildflowers\\" came on I knew I was listening to a great album.  This album creates a very nice mood and it reminds me a lot of Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks\\".  This is Tom Petty wearing his heart on his sleeve and when you listen to this album, you can actually feel his hurt especially on tracks like \\"You Don't Know How it Feels\\" and \\"You Wreck Me\\" to \\"Only a Broken Heart\\" and \\"Crawling Back To You\\".  Like any classic, the placement of the tracks and the overall theme is brilliant and the overall quality would suffer if you change anything about this.  The sound quality is also brilliant reflecting excellent production and mixing work.  Not only is this destined to be Tom Petty's best ever work, it also has all the markings of an all-time classic album for the future.  Tom Petty proves he's a great talent and cries out for respect as a great songwriter with this masterpiece.  Very highly recommended.

It is astonishing that we have managed to hold the line as well as we have.\\"<br /><br />An important part of reading this book is that Mr. Spencer lays bare the myth that what is causing the problem is NOT a radical splinter of Islam but the core beliefs of Islam.<br /><br />Know your enemy.
B00008S2VG|4.0|American Life is not an album one should simply disregard because of what some critics have said out of fashion.  Lets forgive Madge her little tourette rap sessions that appear on this album.  Lets also forgive the dance vomit mistake of Im so stupid...that elongated overproduced techno howl (Iiiiiiiiiiii -- iiiiiiiiiii - iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii- I'm so stupid) had the ability to cause migranes on the spot.  Mother and Father had that weird rap again...but it was still a sad song.  Easy Ride and Hollywood--they were just boring. <br /> <br />Now, lets get to the good stuff, the stuff that you CANNOT DENY on this album. <br /> <br /> <br />Nothing Fails is an amazing ballad.  The buildup of the gospel choir climax is nothing short of breathtaking... <br /> <br />Love Profusion should have been the 2nd single off this cd,,,it would have outperformed the drab Hollywood in catchiness. <br /> <br />Intervention serves up that great acoustic dance rock reminiscent of Dont Tell Me, and has a delicate lilting lyrical edge in the chorus. <br /> <br />Ecstatic Process is perhaps Madonna's best ballad ever.  Armed with nothing but a rusty guitar and surprisingly touching lyrics, the genius is evident in the simpleness of this song.   <br /> <br />Like i said earlier, American Life may not be an amazing album as a whole, but it contains some of Madge's greatest creations within it.  DO NOT DENY IT! <br />
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|I'm a fan of different genres of film generally.  So as far as this type of genre is concerned, I have to say that it's a pretty decent action flick as long as you're not looking for anything with substance.  Good effects and fight/action sequences.  For those I definitely appreciated it.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Every great soundtrack should be able to showcase great songs, while still reminding you of the spirit of the film.  Brokeback Mountain conquers on both fronts.  It has great songs by Linda Rondstant, Willy Nelson and the heartbreakingly beautiful Emmylou Harris, who I must say, is the perfect addition to the music of this film. <br /> <br />The theme, with its expansive, slow-plucked guitars, is both breathtaking and heartbreaking, quite like the film itself. <br /> <br />It will be a long time before the impression of Brokeback Mountain fades from memory, this soundtrack is a necessary addition to your collection if you were moved by the film.  It is an aural embodiement of the undying nature of love. <br /> <br />Haunting is probably the best word to describe it.
1932907009|5.0|This is a great resource and one I'm sure will help a great many people. I loved how it was filled with comedy and touched on many things that writers need to know. Like how to stop putting in too much detail, use Save the Cat scenes as opposed to all those high-tech scenes that do nothing for a film anyway, and how to make your script more believable. One thing to note is that it will be very useful for those doing family comedies but is a good resource for other genres too. I do not have this book on a shelf. I am a writer and my sister and I look into as many books as possible to refine ideas and keep from writing boring movies. This book was my favorite read and it has helped me develop and polish our ideas into something that would be palatable. Thanks Blake and you truly are a great writer and guy. ---Jennifer and Cherie

B00092ZMDY|2.0|I love the Eagles.  I listen to the Eagles Live CD all the time.  But watching this is kinda like waiting in the waiting lounge at the doctors office.  It's not every exciting, in facts it very boring and you cant wait to get the hell outta there.  OK, so the band sounds great, and all members are still at the top of their game, however its just all seems too sterile for me.  It's like watching a Fleetwood Mac concert from 2004 as apposed to 1979.  The 2004 version has the classic line up (except 1 Christine McVie) and a bazillion other musicians on stage trying desperately to re-create that studio sound.  Thats the same thing here. It's all calculated, cued, perfectly executed rock that is never outta tune, messed up or spontaneous.  While Fleetwood Mac has still retained some of their spontinuity, thanks heavily to Lindsey's atmospheric guitar jammimg,  the Eagles just Take It Easy, literally.  It's like their all  playing on auto pilot.  Yeah, that new guy on guitar, Steuart whachamacallhim is good, of course he would be, and yeah, he nails all on Don Felder's solo perfectly, but isn't that what he's suppose to do and suppose to play. I'm glad these guys are still around, especially Joe Walsh, but c'mon, I'd rather see (and hear) the Bomber (aka Joe walsh) perform solo than with the Eagles. It's more risky and exciting.  Joe Walsh is a clown in concert, and he use to be like that with the Eagles, but now he's just takes it one day at a time.  Like I first mentioned, I like the Eagles, they were exciting live when it was just the 5  guys on stage jamming, and probably under some kind of influence.  Nowadays, it's like watching a classic rock band, if you know what I mean.

B000000WA4|5.0|I really wasnt the biggest fan of the Smashing Pumpkins. I thought that the other albums before this had some OK tunes, yet I wasnt impressed. Then when this album came out and I heard the song \\"1979\\" I was hooked. I said, I will give it a try, since I thought that was a great song, and was also a fan of \\"Tonight\\" but little did I know that the album would be so powerful and so damn good, I even have to say it might be the Beatles \\"White album\\" of the modern era. Listen, its a must that you have this CD in your collection, as there is some great Rock and Roll here. Its raw, full of energy, and yes there are some slow songs that drag a little bit, yet right after a slow song or two, they crank it right back up again. This is a treaure the rock music, and its really sad that this would be the Pumpkins last studio effort. There have been rumors of the band getting back together, since Billy Coragins solo has not been doing that well. We need a band like the Pumpkins back, since Rock and Roll has turned somewhat into a sellout fest of garbage. Pick this one up if you dont have and ENJOY..Its one of the greats of the modern era..
B000BNTM96|4.0|As far as QOTSA albums go, it's okay. The songs are fresh-sounding (which is something I don't always find with live albums) but the real item being showcased here is the concert DVD. Impeccably trippy. It adds a completely enthralling element to the already rocking music and let's you relax and such with the band in a sort of intimate way. I definitely recommend this to hardcore QOTSA fans but I'm not sure the average joe would appreciate it as much as I did.
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|Sia Furler made a name for herself as a strong, soulful vocalist working with the likes of Massive Attack and Zero 7, but she is now garnering a devoted following of her own music. Colour The Small One is Sia's second full-length release and it's a quantum leap forward over her past work.<br /><br />Colour The Small One is an album comprised of wondrous, slow-burning pop music with added layers of electronica to provide texture and depth. Much of it sounds downtempo and chilled, yet it's much too emotionally engaging to be branded as chillout music. Throughout the day, little snippets of Sia's songs rerun in your mind, and by night they seem to skirt around the corners of your dreams. I'm not sure how or why this happens - but clearly she must be doing something right in the songwriting department.<br /><br />A striking example of Sia's exquisite and haunting songcraft is 'Breathe Me', a track used to good effect in a recent episode of the wildly popular Six Feet Under. It's a song that positively aches with pain and longing and it can take alot of the credit for gaining Sia more widespread attention. But 'Breathe Me' is just one among many great songs here. Other highlights include comedown anthem in the making 'Sunday', the lovely, visceral 'Numb', the sweetly hypnotic 'Moon' and the lively 'Sweet Potato' which does sound alot like Nelly Furtado - a good thing in my book, and a good song regardless.<br /><br />The gripping 'Don't Bring Me Down' though, is the real highlight. I'm always a sucker for strings and this tracks subtle utilization of them beautifully heightens the tension and drama within the song. It sounds a bit like Emilliana Torrini, only better.<br /><br />Only the ponderous 'The Bully' misses the mark, but I can easily overlook one so-so song when the other ten are as solidly enjoyable as they are here.<br /><br />Sia may be understated but she shouldn't be underestimated.<br /><br />Like this? Try > Tina Dico - In The Red
B000ASATYO|5.0|If you have not seen this, you don't know what you have missed. If you have already seen it, then buy this edition, because the picture transfer is very good with an excellent documentry, who can make better DVD features than Peter Jackson? 4 hours of informative and fun extra materials.
B0000025US|3.0|I can't give this a CD bad rating; these guys are good. I mean, really, really good. <br /> <br />But I can't really give it a top rating, either. The entire CD is really a show-off session for their technical skills, at the expense of containing much really enjoyable guitar music. <br /> <br />In fact, I almost wonder if the trio format forces them to do this. Maybe each of the 3 worried that they'd be singled out in reviews as the \\"weak\\" one of the group, who didn't show much technique next to the other guys. <br /> <br />In any case, if you're a hard-core guitar-technique afficionado, you'll certainly be impressed. But if you're looking for some engaging guitar music you might pass on this one. <br />
B0000C7PRY|4.0|I approached this with a lot of aprehension after reading some of the negative reviews about the lyrical content and 3/4 of this is absolutely brilliant! The last section with the brass and strings i felt was way overdone and very preachy. Now (unlike most musicians who find God-fall off the wagon and write a whole album about it) i think Neal Morse is genuine in his spiritual awakening and good for him. I'm no church goer but i do believe in a higher being but that is neither here nor there regarding this album, i would say to anyone being put off by the religous connotations is do like i did and just don't read the lyrics (getting the thick booklet back in the poxy c.d case is hardly worth it!) just enjoy the music because it is prime prog rock (special mention the violin player) with great riffs and guitar playing. It is a bit much to take in at one go, but not quite up to 'snow' its a worthy addition to the Morse collection. To be honest i do the same thing with heavy rock albums with their satanic leanings which i actually find a whole lot more embarassing!
B00000GAIW|5.0|Jethro Tull's AquaLung is a piece or Rock history that EVERY music fan should have in their collection. For those not familer with the band, this would be the album to get aqainted with them. I believe this to be thier best effort, even though they do have some Great songs that arent on this album (Bungle in the Jungle) but this one really shines. Aqualung is a musical experience, full of emotion and energy, and full of creativity. At times its a little strange, but still a treasure to listen to again and again. I even listened to this when I was in my all Heavy Metal faze, and thats saying alot, its that good and that appealing..ENJOY
0792844882|5.0|This movie is so bad, that its so good. I never get tired of watching it. Everyone is so badly over the top, that it's laughable! Watched it hundreds of times, and it never gets tiring! An instant trash classic! I love it!
B0006IIPIK|5.0|It Is very curious to find movies so  evolved , in a technical way but at the same time using resources to tell a story from the past. Captain Sky is one of them, a back to the future from an imaginary and alternative y sophisticated past. The director takes a look to the daily strips, pulp stories and typical series from the thirties like Flash Gordon, Buck Rogers, Fu-man chu, even Tharzan. Old movies but still a reference like King Kong, Metropolis, Forbidden planet (probably the only one reference that can be consider as new. The movie was filmed in the middle of the fifties) among other that even for me are unknown at my thirties. <br /> <br />With these elements, the director and writer build a story that in many ways can be considerer old fashioned for the new generations, still suffering the consequences of Matrix but involved in the special texture like the strange colour, a mix between old black and white and the first colour movies, a brilliant production designer, and a story that starts and ends in no more than an hour and a half. It is difficult not giving into the charming of the Sky captain and his adventures. <br /> <br />The process of production is very sophisticated but not new. To film actors in an empty room painted in a blue or green colour is not new but it wouldn't have been developed so far today without George Lucas and the episodes I and II from Star Wars. In spite of this, Captain Sky can still be considered  a pioneer because the process has gone beyond Star Wars. All in the movie, except the cloths and in some cases, a furniture, has been created in a computer, making the post-production more important than the filmation with the actors. <br /> <br />I don't know if Captain Sky will be a great success or not, but I know that has put the first step in a new era and is going to be a reference during the next decade. <br />
B000000ORE|5.0|Still holds up almost 20 years later. This was one of the first CD's I bought back in 1989. Funny thing too, I was a fat lil kid, and I used this CD as my \\"workout\\" music. And I lost 60lbs in 6 months. No joke. But the music still holds up. They didn't need gimmicks like most of the bands back around then.
B000BYA5GO|2.0|The iron-clad grip of politically correct, left-wing ideology on today's Hollywood dictates that this film must wring its hands about the evils of arms trafficking, while at the same time glamorizing gun-running to such an extent that I wanted to go out and sell an Uzi immediately after the credits rolled.  It reminded me of how Cecil B. DeMille would add scantily clad dancing girls to sex up his biblical epics.  What better place to hide the sex?  \\"Lord of War\\" depicts gun-running as an incredibly glamorous and exciting lifestyle, while at the same time pretending to condemn it.<br /><br />The film seems to want to be taken seriously, but it is not made in a realistic manner; it is a jokey film with a jokey narration by Nicholas Cage, and all sorts of absurd and utterly unbelievable plot devices.  The Hollywood left needs to get serious about their political enthusiasms.  If you want to make a serious movie condeming arms-trafficking, then do it.  But  don't try, at the same time, to seduce us into the lifestyle.

B000BVQ9JO|3.0|First Impressions Of Earth je veliki korak nazad za The Strokes. Gde je nestao sav onaj smek sa prethodna dva albuma po kojem su The Strokes bili tako prepoznatljivi? Sa ovim albumom bend je na granici da se stopi sa gomilom drugih bendova koji se vise nerazlikuju ni po muzici ni po izgledu. Ovo im se moze oprostiti, ali sledeci album... Hmmm!
B000B7HZXM|1.0|<br />Normally I stay away from providing my comments on stuff I hate.  If it's not my taste, no reason to trash it.  This, however, is not a matter of taste.  I first saw Rod Stewart perform one of the songs from the first in this American Songbook series on TV a couple of years ago.  I was incredulous at how bad it was and almost felt sorry for the guy.  Now fourth into the series and millions sold, obviously there's a market for this tripe.  Recently a friend put on this latest version, apparently trying to show off his good taste.  Oh my God, this is bad. <br /> <br />I happen to love this style of music when it's performed well. I understand some boomers getting on in age don't find their Grand Funk and Uriah Heep records that satisfying any more.  It's a shame, though, that they reach for third rate recordings because they're by someone they're familiar with.  Why buy these nails-on-the-chalkboard performances when there's so much great material avaialble from the likes of Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, Mel Torme, Ella Fitzgerald, etc.?  (Or, if you want more recent recordings, go for Diana Krall or Ntalie Cole.) <br /> <br />Rod Stewart's 70s material stands among some of the finest rock music ever recorded.  I don't blame him, though, for cranking out this tripe.  I'm sure he was also surprised about the enormous success of this series.  Who's going to sneeze at millions of dollars?  But, mark my words, ten years from now, this whole American Songbook series will have been long out of print.  Meanwhile, all of Rod's earlier work will still be in print.  If you like \\"lounge\\" music, this sucks.  If you like Rod Stewart, this sucks.  Clear?
B00002E23E|5.0|Led Zeppelin is considered a metal band -- they pioneered the genre, in fact --  but their range and talent is unparalled and it's all on full display in The Song Remains the Same. As far as I'm concerned, ignorance or just flat-out bad taste is the only reason not to appreciate the true genius that went into the songwriting, performance and production value of this musical masterpiece, especially considering that it was made in the 70's. Basically, giving it less than 5 stars is the equivalent of saying the Sistine Chapel is pretty good.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I love the DVD so I can see the performers and hear songs that aren't on the CD.  I have both and definitely get more than my money's worth out of both.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This film was incredible.  It portrayed the years on how gay lifestyle had to be to the dot.  It shows that true love can be found anywhere.  I didn't like the ending, I know they like to keep you wondering at the end of a movie.  This just left too much up in the air I suppose. It definately was a tear jerker.  The experience at the theater did not go as well.  Watched several people walk out during the movie, and actually someone walked to the front right infront of the screen and yelled \\"you people really want to watch these f#*&%*#?\\"  I could not believe it, with all the talk everyone had to have known it was a gay oriented movie before they paid to see it.

B000BVD460|5.0|not everyone has been giving this record five stars, thumbs up to those who do.   but based off of \\"when i'm gone\\"  alone,  that you can not rate this five stars, get over it,  if you don't like him by now,  we know it and know you don't really have to waste your time disses him,  how about go rate your likes and leave our loves alone.  i only  4 star or less,  when i see that the ablum could of used a little more work time and patents on it. but they are still worth a listen no matter what i rate or say.  so  lift em up.  peace and love!! understand?  a family man.  give him a break. peace. utter kindness.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This cd is purely amazing. I don't understand how anyone could compare Panic! to Fall Out Boy. FOB is lame, overrated, and their sound never changes. P!ATD is original in the lyrical sense, and moreso in their sounding than any band in the pop-punk/dance-rock category ever has been. For anyone who enjoys music and has a taste for everything. <br />Though the first few songs on the cd are more bland, halfway through it's like the entire sound changes. More danceable. more fun, and certainly more lyrically entertaining.  <br />My personal favorite is \\"There's A Good Reason Why These Tables Are Numbered Honey, You Just Haven't Thought Of It Yet\\" for many reasons. Driving around I play this song on repeat and just sing along every time, never getting tired of it. <br />So, in short. If you want something exciting and fun, this album is worth it.
B00079018K|3.0|I have to agree with the reviewer who points out how annoying the MediaMax software is on this CD. But don't let it ruin your listening experience.  <br /> <br />Here's a hint for those not in the know: hold down the shift key when you put the CD in and your computer will ignore the software install. Then you can listen to the music *you paid for* - and copy it to your hard drive uninterrupted.  <br /> <br />As for Kasabian, they're a fun band that as others have pointed out, owe a lot to the Stone Roses, Primal Scream and New Order in places, too. Definitely worth a listen, even if it is all pretty derivative.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This was an excellent DVD and I loved all the music.  The singers were superb!!!!!
B000BP86OG|1.0|Listening to this makes me wanna pull out my classic AC/DC albums with Bon Scott of the 70's, cause I know they sound similar and are better.  This band is so unoriginal its surprising how popular they are cause to me they are just another crap 70's rock rip-off band.
0953104907|5.0|This book explains thoroughly the concepts of designing a guitar.  It most deffinetly does not take you step by step... but then it wouldn't be called building \\"your own\\" would it?  It has some great example projects done in it, so you get the feel of a tutorial.  NOTE! that if u have not worked with wood, or any material crafting, it might be a challange.
B0001LYH9S|5.0|The eerie storyline that ties the songs together adds to the fantasy and mood of the CD. A dismal, desperate attitude in the lyrics and sometimes discordant music. Add to this David Bowie's ethereal voice and you've got a great masterpiece of industrial music.
B00005MP58|5.0|This film is a classic.  Jane Austen was clearly ahead of her time when she wrote this book.  Every time I see a different version of the book in film, I fall in love with it all over again.  The actors perform their roles in the mini series.  By the end fo the film, you too will want your own Mr. Darcy.
0767827902|5.0|Based on Larry McMurtry's excellent novel (he's had unusually great luck in having Hollywood make superb movies based on his books), this is a great movie about the slow death of a small Texas town, about coming of age, and, perhaps most of all, about people starved for love. It's an episodic picture, with many different things happening, but basically it revolves around a small group of high-schoolers and their love lives, from the viper girl (Cybill Shepherd), who is totally self-centered and will probably be the ruin of every man she comes near, to the 40-ish Cloris Leachman who suddenly comes alive sexually when Timothy Bottoms begins having an affair with her. The expert playing of the smaller roles (Ben Johnson, Ellen Burstyn, and Eileen Brennan in particular) is a great plus, as is the continual use of late-'40s country music (especially Hank Williams) in the background (the setting is early 1950s). Director Peter Bogdanovich has a great feel for this era and Texas setting. It's a terrific movie, definitely worth a watch.
0670033375|3.0|Jared Diamond is too good a scientist to write a bad book, but this book is disappointing. It is not just that it fails to meet the high standards set by Diamond in Guns, Germs and Steel (indeed, that book is such a masterpiece, it would not be fair to compare them). Rather, what 'dooms' this book to some extent is the often self-important/self-satisfied tone set by the UCLA professor and his groupie students. Diamond is resting on his laurels, rather than on the hard research and stone-cold analysis that marked his previous books. Collapse does have its moments, particularly the chapter on Easter Island, which is probably worth the cost of the book. But Diamond's set of variables for why societies collapse reads more like a laundry list than a piece of scholarship. Finally, and sadly, the writing is often dull. One gets the feeling that it was completed in order to reach a publisher's deadline, rather than when the work had been fully completed. Nonetheless, this book makes much better reading than the post-modern garbage and self-serving political activism that characterizes much of social science work today.
B000002572|5.0|I am a simple guy with big needs in music. Boston definetly fills those needs. From the magnificent harmonies, to crazy guitar licks, this cd just gets better. With the soft to high sounds of MORE THAN A FEELING and PEACE OF MIND, to crazy keyboarding/guitar beats of FOREPLAY/LONG TIME, SMOKIN', and ROCK AND ROLL BAND, this proves that Rock N' Roll definetly was the gauntlet of music, and Boston was the Rock of the Ages.  TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!
B000007489|5.0|This record was their first and as far as i'm concerned. . . . their best. The amazon review is incorrect regarding who played guitar on it though. Nothing agains rocky or mike but Grant Estes played ALL guitars on that record. Those other guys did the remake and it's not even close. Don't waste your money. the original kicks azz and was the total precursor to sooooo many bands today it's not even funny. Mike's insane lyrics spoke to a generation trying to find itself and Grant's guitar work was groundbreaking for that genre of music. NOBODY had solos in punk at that time. This record was ahead of it's time and still holds up today. check it out, you'll play the siht out of it like i do.
038572179X|4.0|Atonement begins from the perspective of Briony Tallis, a girl coming of age in WWII England.  When the story begins, Briony is a precocious 11 year old full of imagination and creativity.  She spends her days writing stories and a play that she uses to attempt to impress her family.  As an author, she spends much of her time observing, and mostly misunderstanding, the actions of the adults around her.  This extends to one fateful night when she thinks she sees the man who rapes her cousin.  Her testimony is the basis for the conviction that haunts her for the rest of her life.  She is forced to live with the results of that testimony, including the unraveling of her family.   <br /> <br />The brilliance of this novel comes from the various perspectives that narrate the story.  Chapters are told from the point of view of many of the main characters including Briony, her sister Cecelia, childhood friend Robbie, and her mother, Emily.  The reader is carried through the compelling story and is able to grasp the full picture even though each portion is told from a different outlook.  This leads to excellent character development that enriches what could otherwise seem a mediocre tale.  The brilliance of the writing is how the characters and  story combine to form a page turning novel. <br /> <br />This is the first novel I have read by McEwan.  It is absolute motivation to read others.  By themselves the characters and the story would not likely stand up to scruitiny.  However, McEwan has blended them well to make for a highly entertaining book.

B0007PAMR4|4.0|The extended version of DUNE finally appears on DVD. I've waited so long for this one. I remember watching the longer version on cable probably a decade or more ago, and loving every little tidbit that was missing from the version I already had.<br /><br />For those who prefer either the film or the mini-series over the other, I'd like to say that I hold them both in high regard. They are both equal in my opinion. Frank Herbert's novels were such deep, multi-faceted stories, not all the details therein translate well to any other medium. Whereas the film concentrates on the inner-thoughts of the characters, and the importance of dreams and prophecy, the mini-series seems to concentrate more on the strict political and religious ramifications of the events told.But let's put aside for a moment what medium best portrays the events in the books. As a film, by itself, Dune is...confusing yes but enrapturing as well. Enigmatic, especially for a self-described epic. But I enjoy it, as should any sci-fi or fantasy fan.<br /><br />I personally like the 1984 Dune. I think the score is splended, the effects remarkable, and the cast spectacular (if their acting is, perhaps, a bit hammy and melodramatic). For one who has read the books, the extended version adds little. For one who hasn't, it provides a good deal of history to Frank Herbert's universe, although sadly by a voice-over that intrudes upon the film.<br /><br />As for the DVD, the special features provide great insight into the creation of the film, although I wish there were more. A commentary or two would have been nice, but getting Lynch to embrace his [illegitimate]child was perhaps too much for me to hope for. The only complaing I have is that it is on a flipper disc. I would have much preferred a 2-disc set. It comes in such a BEAUTIFUL metal snapcase. Great collector's item.

B00005JNRE|5.0|From the Kate Greenaway costumes to the dreamlike colors of the Victorian-horror of a house to Emma Thompson's dark and witty script, this was a delight.  Thompson was wonderful (literally) as the formidable Nanny and Colin Firth's delivery had me rolling.  Derek Jacobi was fun to watch as well.  The scenery and the score were lovely.  It might be a bit much for very young children but older kids should love it.  <br /> <br />One of the few times I've like the film better than the books.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I have not yet read the short story but I have seen the movie and it truly is a tragic love story. I hope this film will help open the eyes of the more close minded people out there to realize love has no boundries, whether the relationship be man-woman, man-man, or woman-woman it grabs hold of you and no matter how hard you try (as shown in this film) you can not elude it. My word of advice for your first time watching this film, bring some tissues- its a tear jerker!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'd made a decision to believe the rating of this Madonna CD and went out to buy a copy of my own. Man, how I ended up loving it! I just can't get enough of Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry and the cool list goes on. I really urge you all to grab a copy of COADF.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|i just purchased this edition and there are some nice aspects to the release.  for one, lets dispel the rumor that there is a DTS audio track - there is none and it is correctly advertised as not having one.  two, there is no difference in this version of the theatrical release and the original that was available on DVD.  three, the extended edition looks much better than the theatrical version.  the picture is clearer with more vibrant colors and less video noise.  my only problem is that the extended edition is obnoxious.  it reminds me of the theatrical release of Blade Runner with that horrible commentary and ridiculous scenes.  the prologue of the extended DUNE is atrocious.  who is the voice from?  he sounds silly and it is as if a 5th grader wrote the commentary.  the whole edition seems to give this feeling as though the audience is stupid.  too many aspects of the plot are explained by the commentary.  many of the additional scenes are great, don't get me wrong and add lots of interesting details, but i get the sense that the director (not david lynch) takes us as idiots who cannot understand the theatrical release and require additional information.  the theatrical release at least respects us as an audience in that we are intelligent and can grasp a complicated plot, while the extended edition assumes we cannot.  four, the extras are great and interesting.

B0007PAMR4|3.0|Dune is the only movie I have ever seen where they gave you a handout before the film to explain all the cryptic terminology in the film. As a long time devotee of Herbert's novel I didn't need it but I certainly remember the puzzlement of others in the theatre trying to make sense of words such as \\"Kwisatz Haderach\\" \\"CHOAM\\" and other Herbert bonbons.  <br />The result was (and is) a fascinating trainwreck of a film. The things that are at still interesting in Lynch's vision (his suitably hi-tech/low-tech looking production design, the often inspired--or at least memorably lunatic--performances from Sian Phillips, Kenneth MacMillan  and, yes, Sting) are unfortunately counterbalanced by the ludicrous script, where bleeding chunks of Herbert's prose (the least actor-friendly language imaginable) try to pass themselves off as conversations between people. Then, and even more so now, one can almost see the actors saying to themselves \\"what the hell is this scene about?\\" One wonders if Lynch, not exactly the most narrative-driven director then or now, really knew either. <br />The Extended Edition (still credited to the strangely frequently employed Alan Smithee) adds a certain amount of coherency but at a cost. Curiously  missing are a few scenes which were the highlights of the theatrical release. Among them, the bizarro Giedi Prime sequence where Rabban eats from a living \\"snack pack\\" and sucks the creature's blood through a straw and, far more perversely, the astonishing scene where the Baron assaults, kills and--we assume from the cutaway shots of blood and other suspected fluids--rapes the helpless flower-arranging servant boy (sort of in that order). Also MIA is the brief (and also appropriately disgusting) scene after the assault on House Atreides where the Baron says farewell to Jessica by spitting on her. Since I suspect these scenes were cut to sell the movie to TV for the original incarnation of the \\"Extended Edition\\" it shows a certain sloppiness and lack ofattention on Universal's part not to provide a \\"true\\" Alan Smithee/David Lynch version with all the good stuff left in it. After all, is TV approrpriateness even an issue for a DVD release? <br />In a really properly run cinematic universe, Lynch would have been given John Harrison's Sci-Fi Channel Dune script (which also takes a few liberties--a planet-trotting Irulan?--but is not only more story coherent but properly fleshes out the interpersonal relationships which also fuel the tale) and a ton of good CGI. The result might have been a Dune for all time. Or there would be the fabled 6 Hour Holy Grail Film Version made public. But since this is the universe that gave us the Wierding Modules and two hours running times, these versions of a flawed-but-fascinating movie are all we can really lay claim to. <br />Let's just hope no-one ever decides to film the last three Dune novels. Anyone who has trouble following the narrative progress of Dune will be agonized by what passes for story-telling in Herbert's later efforts, which are, to say the least, about as hermetically sealed and reader-unfriendly as Stein or Joyce (although maybe Douglas Addams could have been tempted at some point to write his own version called \\"So Long And Thanks For All The Spice\\" which I for one would pay to see in any format....)!

Syd Barrett named then created the vision of the band, was the songwriter of the band, the lead guitarist of the band, and the lead singer of the band.

B00062IVKS|5.0|Generally, I am not a huge fan of special edition - extra DVD editions. However, Raging Bull's special edition is an exception. In this age where movie scripts seem jerry-rigged over night and movies tend to rely so heavily on celebrity recognition and special effects, the inside perspectives of those who made \\"Raging Bull\\" is so refreshing. Commentaries by Martin Scorsese (director), Frank Warner (supervising sound effects editor), and Thelma Schoonmaker (editor) are especially revealing as to the attention to detail and meticulous care that went into \\"Raging Bull.\\" After hearing their interviews, you can truly feel that these artists went through emotional and professional growth over the production of this film. Schoonmaker literally cries while describing the emotional effects the movie had on her. Warner ceremoniously burns the tapes of his sound effects after the movie, because he feels they belong to the movie and should never be used again.<br /><br />With respect to the actors, Cathy Moriarty and Joe Pesci provided the most interesting angles. Pesci, a childhood actor, had given up on acting and was working in a restaurant when approached by DeNiro and Scorsese to do the film. Obviously, his career was rejuvenated after his role as Jake's brother. Also, Raging Bull took Moriarty from being just a neighborhood girl to an Oscar-nominated celebrity for her role as Vickie LaMatta. Previously, she had had some undefined aspirations to be an actress, but had no professional experience; only high school and dinner theater. DeNiro does provide interviews, but his comments are the least inspired, despite the entire project being made primarily at his persuasion.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, it is a masterpiece. Made in the enthusiasm for boxing movies in the wake of 1977's \\"Rocky,\\" Raging Bull puts the sport into a much less glamorous light. Unlike Rocky Balboa, who had a soft loveable side outside the ring, Jake LaMatta was a tyrannical, paranoid, hostile tragic hero outside the ring as well as inside. On a self-destructive path, he destroys everything that is important to him. Although Rocky depicted some of boxing's gruesome side (\\"cut me Nick\\"), Scorsese clearly showcases boxing at its ferocious and savage worst. Blood spurts, noses get crushed. Between rounds, Jake is sponged off with bloody water. Frank Warner uses animal sounds during punches to accentuate the bestial nature of the sport.<br /><br />Great movie. Nobody can swear as well as DeNiro, and he lets them fly throughout. Gory, graphic and tragic, but somehow lyrical, emotional and deeply provoking, Raging Bull is an all time masterpiece. Despite what is in the theatres nowadays, this movie reminds you that movies can still be artistic and made with loving care. Not to be just another notch on each participants \\"filmography,\\" the special edition reveals how much this movie changed the lives of the people involved. In today's movie industry, it is hard to foresee another movie like this being made.

B000002UAX|5.0|As a cohesive whole the Beatles are the best in pop music -- as a cultural phenomenon they are unmatched. Harold Blooms writes in \\"Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human\\" that Shakespeare invented what we consider it is to be human, a bold statement that I think holds up well. With the Beatles I feel they do something very similar. When Shakespeare was writing his plays he was very popular, but no where as popular and venerated as today; because all of those after him sang his praise -- thus he is an institution.<br /><br />  Believe it or not, I feel the Beatles will probably be the same, musically speaking. Every rock/pop musician since the Beatles can't help but imitate them because it is unavoidable. They arose at the beginning of the mass communication age; they were on T.V, movies, albums, lunch boxes, etc... ,like Elvis, one of the first pop/cultural icons, though I feel Elvis won't age as well. Consequently, the mop tops evolved into one of the earliest media acts on which most acts of today are compared -- \\"Yeah, their good but their not the Beatles.\\" Never the less, it is the evolution of the Beatles musically that bodes so well for them some 30 odd years after they broke up. And the White album is a prime example of how the Beatles evolved to 'Sgt. Pepper', 'Magical Mystery Tour', and wanted to evolve back to a grittier sound which lead to the 'White Album'.<br /><br />  So what you see with the 'White Album' is a collection of various musical styles and interests, and only an incredibly successful group could afford to evolve as much as they did and still be accepted or even loved for it at the time. I haven't seen anything like the Beatles around music, John killed, Paul a knight (was George a Knight too?) - all of them are or were tremendously rich because they still sell and are still considered good - Great to me. Regardless, they keep selling albums even years after breaking up and this is because they've influenced everyone after them and are still better than most anyway; sounds like the same thing Harold Bloom wrote about in his book. All those writers after Shakespeare paid homage to Shakespeare and were derivative of him, like the Beatles and pop music today. It'll be interesting to see if this hold true for the next crucial century, but I'd take that bet.<br /><br />If you look at the tracks of the 'White Album', all of them are better than most pop music even of today, although there are some weak songs, `Savoy truffle' comes to mind and `Wild Honey' pie; but that is why I say you are not a Beatles fan unless you Love 'Revolution # 9'; which is an experiment by John with music collage - it should be noted that the collage was considered the art form of the twentieth century. What you see with 'revolution # 9' is an experiment, maybe it doesn't work, but it is bold for a popular act to put something like that out even though most people would just cringe at it, you could say the same about `Wild Honey Pie' too. The Beatles evolved, most acts today don't even get one or two albums to make let alone a 9 minute long song of music clips, dialogue and general weirdness, that I think is brilliant. The 'White album' transcends genres and pokes fun at itself all at the same time, I give a lot of credit to George Martin for the Beatles, he specialized in classical music parodies before he and the Beatles hooked up and the Beatles music seems eerily similar to that, especially `Sgt. Peppers' and `Magical Mystery tour'. Only George Martin (among the Beatles and their entourage) would know what a Bach trumpet is so that Paul could use it for `Penny Lane' for example or to play the Bach piano piece in the middle of `In my Life', which is all brilliant. You could say that only the Beatles, and definitely not any current pop group, could even get away with a double album, (let alone revolution # 9) because the material is good enough and which all coalesces as a whole to form an album. The White album is a classic because it branched out into so many other genera and styles and displayed the growing musical intellect of the group and its music. `Revolution # 9' is the prime example of the emergence, growth and daringness of a group that transcended music and popular culture while pushing the boundaries of taste. I've grown to love `Revolution # 9', just like the sitar songs of George Harrison, for their beauty and courage to expose mainstream culture to the avant-garde; which is essential to any living art form or culture in general.<br /><br />  When the settlers moved west while America was being formed they brought two books: the Bible and the Complete Works of Shakespeare. They were the best, most condensed form of literature worthy to take into the wilderness of America. I think that when people start settling the moon or Mars they'll probably have a copy of the Beatles `White Album' with them for the same reason - the best pop music of the twentieth century that will live through the ages by influencing generation after generation to come.album is a classic because it branched out into so many other genera and styles and displayed the growing musical intellect of the group and its music. `Revolution # 9' is the prime example of the emergence, growth and daringness of a group that transcended music and popular culture while pushing the boundaries of taste.

B000CC49B2|5.0|i love the intensity and the issue brought up in this book <br />i love the fact that in this story, everyone is partly to blame for  the murder of jimmy and nathan's sickness.. <br />it just shows how \\"human\\" the book is.. we keep expecting things to be black and white but it's actually grey.. <br />i love the psychological aspect of the book.. <br />this book is quite dark, exploiting and exploring a person's mind <br />it was a book where you don;t want to put down because you;re afraid you;re going to forget the story and also wanting to know the answers.. <br />the human mind is something complex and i love how gardner portrayed catherine as troubled not like other books where when a person goes through something traumatic, therapy can just make the problem go away magically..there are always unresolved issue... <br />all and all, it was a great read
0743424425|5.0|The Shining is my favorite non-Dark Tower Stephen King book so far. I was captivated by it, because even though this is a fantasy/horror novel, it's just so real. Jack Torrance is an excellent tragic character; a flawed family man whose biggest weakness is alcohol. Once I finished this book, I realized that this book could be considered a long allegory for alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel is addiction; it turns Jack, who is in recovery and earning back his family's trust, into a monster. Any alcoholic, whether recovering or not, understands how alcohol can change your personality, can turn a non-violent person do horrible things that they regret when sober. The idea that what was happening to Jack was not Jack himself, but the hotel, is along those same lines. It's like saying, \\"Your dad didn't hurt you, the booze did.\\" And what Jack becomes in the end, a mindless monster completely taken over by the dark power of the Overlook, is powerful enough to do terrible harm to the two people he claims to love the most. He was addicted to the hotel as if it were a bottle of whiskey. The allegorical aspects here are hard to ignore. <br />Another thing I enjoyed about this book were the small, perfect, and humorous details, my favorite being the description of the groundskeeper as he told Jack about the boiler. The four different times that the guy blew his nose as Jack looked on with amusement. King has a huge talent for details, and sometimes I just have to burst out and laugh at them. The boiler, by the way, also has some symbolism behind it. Temper perhaps...sounds good to me. <br />I love this book...don't confuse it with the Kubrick movie, they are entirely different monsters. Though I love the Kubrick movie, I have to simply forget that it was based on a King story when watching it, because all the elements I loved in the book are missing in the movie. The mini-series in much more faithful to the book, but not a very well-made endeavor. Though I must admit I LOVED StevenWeber as Jack Torrance, at the same time I absolutely HATED the kid who played Danny. He was obscenely horrible and un-cute. Choose your Shining stories wisely, in other words. <br />This is a great story for horror addicts as well as other kinds of addicts. The author knew what he was writing about when he wrote it, which makes it all the more real and readable.
1400031087|5.0|Although many people, once great fans of this book, are now speaking negatively about it, I feel that it is a great book, and there are many others who feel the same way. I read this book long before the controversy, even long before it entered Oprah's Book Club, and I have always believed in James Frey's credibility. The novel is interestingly written as well as interesting; it is difficult to not become completely absorbed in the novel. Fiction or nonfiction, A Million Little Pieces is a fantastic book.  <br /> <br />Many nonfiction books written are not completely factual. Authors many times exaggerate and elaborate to make for a more interesting story for their readers. James Frey did spend time in rehab, and that is what his book is written about. Millions of people read the book before its credibility became questionable, and the majority of those people enjoyed the book. The categorization of the book: fiction or nonfiction should not matter to readers. What should matter to readers is the quality and feeling of the book, both of which are extraordinary.  <br />
0385504209|4.0|I was familiar with \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" so the plot of the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" was not that surprising. Everybody and their sister has probably read this book already, but for the few out of the loop go ahead and get it and read it on the plane or in the bathroom, the best place for it. It is a very exciting and readable book, like most best selling sensations, but I'd suggest to carry around a giant grain of salt and take the book with it.<br /><br />  I am not religious, but even I found this book sacrilegious. Not to spoil anything but Jesus comes off as too real of a guy. I found the art history thing interesting, I guess Dan Brown's  wife helped him with that -- maybe she should write a book? I have met a lot of people who love this book, my reaction is a shrug.<br /><br />However, I did see that the book has come out with pictures of the paintings talked about in it and the places in Europe where a lot of the action takes place. So, if you are going to buy this book get the one with the many pictures in it to help visualize the \\"Mona Lisa\\" for example; because I had to try to find Da Vinci's picture on the internet to understand Dan Brown descriptions and points.<br /><br />Also, for all of those people that read \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" the moral of that story about these three Italian friends inventing a conspiracy from historical guess work, with no basis in fact, seems eerily familiar to the \\"Da Vinci Code\\", the book and the popularity of the book. Like detective novels where you find out who did it in the end and the world order is returned, conspiracy theories give the same deluded sense of control that there is someone in control behind the curtains dictating things -- thus there is someone to blame and there is some one in control.<br /><br />  In addition, If you want to read a good historical mystery in the vein of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" might I suggest \\"The Dante Club\\" but not so much \\"The Sign of the four\\".
0440241588|1.0|I've never taken the time to write a book review, but this book needs a warning label. If you like suspense, intrigue, spy thillers, intelligence, character developement, plot twists, or interesting dialogue, you might be more interested in \\"Curious George\\". The man with the yellow hat has more depth than Joel Backman. <br />Halfway through the book it's obvious that Grisham spent some time in Bologna, and is eager to share that experience with us, as well as teach us all some italian, but a book called \\"Travelogue to Bologna\\" by John Grisham probably wouldn't sell. Wrap a \\"B\\" movie around it, advertise it at Krogers every 20 minutes on the p.a., add a spy novel cover, and you have a nice vacation tax write-off.

B00005JNRE|4.0|I found this film to be very refreshing after all that has been in the theatres lately.  I am 72 years young and found it very funny and yet gave you a very good feeling when it was over, no sex, gore or monsters...very good for me and my family.
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|This is an excellent addition to anyone's Buddy Guy collection. Most of the songs are rock solid cover versions of great tunes like \\"Cheaper To Keep Her\\" and \\"On A Saturday Night\\" and the songs with guest artists show off different sides of this Living Legend's enormous talent. Not a bad song in the bunch. My only minor complaint would be that there is only one original composition by Buddy Guy (that explains the 4 rather than 5 stars), but the guitar solos are explosive and the song selection is wonderfully varied.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|If this film doesn't inspire you to take dance lessons, you have no soul.  But actually it's about more than just dancing.  It's about a man who wants more in life, and lo and behold, eventually discovers that he wants his wife to share in that \\"more\\".  The cast is wonderful, each of them giving their characters a sweet vulnerability that makes us cheer them on especially through the climactic competition. This is definitely a \\"feel good\\" film and one that you will want to own so that you can see it whenever you need a pick-me-up.   <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|In their first album release in nearly three years, System of a Down surprises us in more than one way. The big one is--- this band has two bona fide lead singers! Serj Tankian has always been the face and voice of SOAD, but with the release of Mezmerize/Hypnotize, we discover that in fact Daron Malakian is just as good..... just in a completely different way. Don't worry.... we still get plenty of Tankian's roaring voice, but added to it now is Daron's somber wailing. Mezmerize was released in May of 2005, followed by Hypnotize, released in November. The two albums have a small connection as the intro to Mezmerize is basically a continuation to the last song on Hypnotize. This album is shorter than what we're used to from System, clocking in at thirty-six minutes, still it is a great album. Also with these new albums, we get some awesome cover art that we didn't get with the previous three. The two covers slip together to make a really cool design. <br /> <br />The music of Mezmerize--- <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side-Intro (4/5) A nice beginning to an awesome album. <br /> <br />2. B.Y.O.B. (5/5) A fantastic song with music ranging from your vintage heavy metal to something that sounds like it could be on a Jessica Simpson album, \\"Everybody's goin' to the party/Have a real good time.\\" Then you have Malakian come in and scream \\"Blast off! It's party time!\\" It's a song about war, but more so about who fights (or doesn't fight) the wars. They ask \\"Why don't presidents fight the wars?/Why do they always send the poor?\\" A great song. <br /> <br />3. Revenga (4/5) It opens with a simple beat then it break into Serj's classic rap-metal style, followed by the chorus \\"My sweet revenge will be yours...for the taking/It's in the making baby.\\" Very catchy, cool beat. <br /> <br />4. Cigaro (4/5) This one starts with Malakian screaming \\"My c**k is much bigger than yours!\\" And that is the energy that the song carries. I love the beat, but the song has very little substance. <br /><br />5. Radio/Video (4/5) Again, a song with little substance. But it is quite catchy with both singers chanting \\"Hey man, look at me rockin' out, I'm on the radio!/Hey man, look at me rockin' out, I'm on the video!\\" Great beat. <br /> <br />6. This Cocaine Makes me Feel Like I'm on This Song (3/5) The beat is alright and the lyrics are comedic, but ludicrous.  <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography (5/5) Such an addictive song. I love singing along to this one. You go from rapping about what everyone does (\\"everybody, everybody, everybody livin' now\\") to screaming about the substance of a violent porno (\\"chokin' chicks and sodomy\\"). Really good! <br /> <br />8. Question! (5/5) The second single off this album (after B.Y.O.B.) This song is also the second song on the album that makes any sense. It asks what happens when we die? Where do we go? An awesome video is attached (it comes on the Hypnotize dual-disc.) <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue (4/5) High energy song about what recent generations have done to damage what will be our history. They cry \\"You and me will all go down in history with a sad Statue of Liberty and a generation that didn't agree.\\" <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood (5/5) Awesome beat starts off an awesome song about Daron's experience at a celebrity softball game at Dodger Stadium. Very techy sounding gives us yet another sound that we hadn't heard from SOAD. <br /> <br />11. Lost in Hollywood (5/5) A mystifying, bizarre, haunting song that takes us on a journey through the streets of Hollywood. Malakian leads on this ballad that is nearly five and a half minutes long, SOAD's longest song since \\"Mind\\" off of their first album. This is the song that truly shows us that Daron Malakian is fully capable of carrying a song, with Tankian in the background chanting (the opposite of the norm). <br /> <br />A tremendous album in System of a Down's return to the spotlight. <br /> <br />Peace to all. To rid our world of biological weapons, we must lead by example.  <br /> <br />
0780020685|5.0|This movie is on of the most beautiful of all times it really stands up to it's name which is not the case of overated movies as THE GODFATHER or THE CITIZEN KANE...this movie is a beautiful look on the 16th century japan...all the acting is excellent!...the samouries are all very good in theire differente roles you really get touched by them and you feel close to them...,this film is complete:it has everything...The only slight \\"defect\\" is that it is a bit long the film is about 3h30(it's maybe 30 min too long)not the last 30 min but in the overall,some scenes could of not been shown,not shown because they are bad but perhaps not \\"uneccesary\\"(i guess it's because the film has been cut in half when it first came out;so this is the complete vision Korasawa had...) but anyways it does not in any way ruin the film!AKIRA KOROSAWA is really one of the best filmakers he can transport you into his story,and has a critical eye on society he brilliantly knows how to translate it on the screen,and is one of the most influencial too...and the final line when the samourai looks at the village then looks in the sky with graves is very deep if you understand it's true meaning...
B00007E8V4|5.0|Once again, System of a Down comes to us with an album full of uniquely different music. Released just a year after the hugely successful \\"Toxicity\\", Steal This Album! is not more new music, but rather previously written, unreleased tracks. Like you would expect from SOAD, you get a totally different vibe from this album than you do from any of their other work. Don't expect another Toxicity or you will be sorely disappointed. This album is great in it's own way. Returning to previously touched subjects, they go into more detail--- attacking war with \\"Boom!\\"and abuse of power with \\"Mr. Jack.\\"  <br /> <br />The songs--- <br /> <br />Chic 'n' Stu (4/5) Bizarre song which is about the damage advertising has done to our culture, hypnotizing with catchy phrases and tempting us with pictures of say a \\"pizza, pizza pie.\\" <br /> <br />Inner Vision (4/5) Confusing song at least to me. It seems to be about the mad obsession over psychology. Very catchy song, one of those you'll find yourself screaming along with Serj Tankian and backup Daron Malakian. <br /> <br />Bubbles (4/5) In this song Serj and Daron sing together through nearly the entire song about a power struggle that they are forced to fight without any arms. <br /> <br />Boom! (5/5) Great song about the emotionless governments who bomb cities with no concern of civilian life. Children, pregnant women, innocent people dead. Very catchy song and very, very powerful. If you can find the video that is attached to this song, watch it. <br /> <br />Nguns (5/5) No idea what this song means, but I think it speaks of the underground arms dealers who would sell a gun to a baby if they had the money. <br /> <br />A.D.D. (5/5) Meaning American Dream Denial, is about how war and government have corrupted our world and made it impossible for the American Dream to be obtained. You just want to scream with Tankian, \\"WE DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT YOUR WORLD!\\" <br /> <br />Mr. Jack (5/5) Starts bizarre and then it breaks into SOAD's signature heavy metal noise machine. The song is about the abuse of power especially by police. They ask \\"Hey where you at?\\" which is answered by \\"On the side of the freeway in the car.\\" Then we have the standoff. Cops saying \\"Put your hands up, get out of the car\\" to which they respond in a brutal yelling \\"F*** YOU PIG!\\" <br /> <br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O (4/5) Very catchy song. I found myself singing along nearly immediately the first time I heard it. The chorus is muffled but once you interpret it, it is quite funny. <br /> <br />36 (2/5) Very short song (46 seconds). Lots of noise.  <br /> <br />Pictures (3/5) At two minutes, this song is far too long. It is basically Tankian and Malakian saying the same three lines repeatedly. Not much substance at all. <br /> <br />Highway Song (4/5) Yet another confusing song, but like the others this too is quite catchy. Toward the end of the song we get some sounds that we wouldn't even expect from SOAD. <br /> <br />F*** the System (4/5) About the fact that went to war with Iraq without UN support. The message is great and the energy of this song is even better. You just want to scream it! <br /> <br />Ego Brain (5/5) I love this song because it is so calm and almost dreamy at the beginning. It leads nicely into a beautiful chorus. It speaks of pain and suffering, they sound like they are crying it out. <br /> <br />Thetawaves (3/5) Seems to be the sequel to Toxicity's \\"Science\\" as they now speak of technological science and how we now depend so much on computers and such. <br /> <br />Roulette (4/5) This song almost sounds like it could be on the end of the Hypnotize album with \\"Lonely Day\\" and \\"Soldier Side.\\" Very quiet song in which our two singers are singing along side each other the whole length of the song. <br /> <br />Streamline (5/5) About the feeling of helplessness when you can't help someone you love and they are lost as a result. A beautiful ending. <br /> <br />Peace to all. Make a difference. Vote!
B000AY74OG|5.0|The movie is great.  It is entertaining for children and also interesting to adults, as it contains many allusions.  When the receipient finally watched the movie, it was scratched.  Amazon replaced the movie immediately and paid for the shipping charges to return the damaged DVD.
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity, an attack on government corruption, was the number one seller the week of September 11th. That this was the medicine for so many people in such a difficult time should tell you in itself that this is a brilliant, powerful, climactic album. But if it isn't, then here I be. System of a Down's first album (self-titled) was clamorous in it's nature. Toxicity, however, addresses the band's problems with society in a more melodious, haunting manner. It does start off a bit noisy with songs like \\"Prison Song\\" and \\"Jet Pilot\\", but takes an unexpected turn starting with the album's first single \\"Chop Suey\\" and continuing with songs such as \\"Toxicity\\" and the astronomical hit \\"Aerials\\" which at one point reached number one on the charts. Also, backup singer Daron Malakian makes his presence felt a bit more on this album. <br /> <br />My views on each song individually--- <br /> <br />1. Prison Song (5/5) Great song about the corruption in prisons today. It also attacks the criminal nature of America and over-sentencing. <br /> <br />2. Needles (5/5) Opening with pure noise produced by it seems all of the instruments in SOAD's arsenal, this song is brilliant in it's eccentric nature. Serj Tankian screams to you \\"pull the tape worm out of your ass\\" because it is controlling you. <br /> <br />3. Deer Dance (5/5) A song about police brutality. It speaks of \\"pushing little kids with their fully-automatics\\" and beating on the weak and poor. Haunting song, it is beautifully constructed. <br /> <br />4. Jet Pilot (3/5) One of the weakest songs on the album (and there aren't many). Very repetitive and seemingly of no significant substance. <br /> <br />5. X (4/5) Another very repetitive song but this one at least attempts to have a message that makes sense. Serj screams at us that \\"we don't need to multiply\\", speaking of course of the world's obscene over-population. <br /> <br />6. Chop Suey (5/5) On an album full of brilliant songs, this one seems to stand above all othersin it's bizarre nature. The opening beat seems to hypnotize us and then draw us in. Then Tankian blasts us with a strong chorus, \\"Wake up! Grab a brush/put on a little makeup. etc...\\" Then he drops into a ballad singing \\"I don't think you trust in my self-righteous suicide/I cry when angels deserve to DIIIIIIIIEEEEEEE!!!!!!\\" It is amazing. <br /> <br />7. Bounce (3.5/5) Another one of the album's few weak points. But perhaps this one is necessary. Despite being utterly ridiculous, it seems to hold some unknown secret that we wish to unlock. In this way, we are drawn to it, and we find ourselves bouncing to the beat where ever we are.... in the car, in the house or on a street corner waiting for the \\"WALK\\" sign. <br /> <br />8. Forest (5/5) A very middle-eastern sounding opening leading into a heavy dosage of drums and bass. A bit confusing in it's meaning, it still holds our attention. We want to be walking through the forest with Serj seeking what he is, whatever that may be. <br /> <br />9. Atwa (5/5) Starting slow, Serj and Daron almost whisper \\"Hey you see me, pictures crazy. All the world I've seen before me passing by.\\" Then a brief explosion of noise followed by the soft haunting whispers again. The song follows this theme through a few times, accumulating more and more music behind it as it goes. <br /> <br />10. Science (5/5) An attack on the fact that we have abandoned all natural beliefs and cures for science which in it's addictive nature has proven to be poisonous to us all. Serj's chanting of \\"Spirit moves through all things\\" feels almost to be a remedy. <br /> <br />11. Shimmy (4/5) It starts by adding a new sound every ten seconds and then we hear Serj, \\"Education, Fornication, Innuendo!\\" At this point in the album we have grown tired of the same noise, but we are still intrigued by Tankian's message. <br /> <br />12. Toxicity (5/5) Another one of the brilliant songs off the album, from which it got it's name. Haunting, creepy song in it's tone. Itcertainly makes you think about what our world has become- corrupt, without order and poisoned by government and greed. <br /> <br />13. Psycho (A low rumbling begins and then you hear what is undoubtedly a rip-off of the famous \\"re-re-re-re\\" from the movie \\"Psycho.\\" The song is about groupies who are so hopped up on coke that they have become psychotic in their obsession. <br /> <br />14. Aerials (5/5) Along with Chop Suey, this is my favorite song on the album. And by following Psycho and leading into Arto, Aerials is by far the most haunting song from the album. Serj, with his amazing voice compares life to a waterfall and how we want something but are not willing to give up anything to get it. Pure greed is all it is. <br /> <br />14.5 Arto (5/5) Technically I suppose this is a hidden track since it is not listed on the cover. Ritualistic is what comes to mind after listening to it once through. Hearing the band chanting \\"A Shumba Wumba\\" over and over again. As you near the end you hear screams which seems to be the human sacrifice that we have made for the world we live in now. <br /> <br />This is by far the greatest album I have ever heard. SOAD's new stuff is fantastic, but it pales in comparison to this masterpiece we call Toxicity. <br /> <br />Peace to all. No exceptions!

B000007T1M|5.0|Having been ten when this was released (and not a big fan of metal), I did not hear this album for the first time until last year. The first few times through there were only a couple of songs that I liked. Now that I've heard it many times through, I see it for what it truly is. A politically driven breakthrough for the metal genre. This was a great start for a great band, System of a Down, who has to date released four more albums. It is hard to compare each of the albums because they are so different in style. This, their debut, is their loudest. They unleash their anger at the corruption in our world with  very loud  music and lead singer Serj Tankian screaming their message as loud as he can. There are more mellow songs on the album such as their first major hit, \\"Spiders\\" and \\"Suggestions\\".  <br />Here are my rating for each song on the album: <br /> <br />1. Suite-Pee (5/5) My interpretation of this song is that Jesus, the figure that is praised by billions was in fact a woman. It's a great start to the album, introducing you immediately to their style of mixing hard metal and a bit of an Arabian sound to present their political views. <br /> <br />2. Know (3/5) Another sampling of their Arabian metal chanting. <br /> <br />3. Sugar (5/5) This is my favorite song on the album. With Serj pounding his message into your head, Daron Malakian is in the background saying \\"Sug-ah!\\" Very addictive song with it's wide range of tones. <br /> <br />4. Suggestions (4/5) Starts off slow then hurls you into a wave of confusion and disarray. Along with it's political tones, their is a small religious undertone that sneaks into the ramblings of Tankian at the climax of the song. <br /> <br />5. Spiders (5/5) Undoubtedly the ballad of this album. Slow. Simple. And one of the easiest songs to understand. You'll find yourself singing along the first time you hear it and humming it even when it's over. It is so powerful because of it's clerity and simplicity. It is beautiful. <br /> <br />6.Ddevil (4/5) Short song and very confusing. Serj seems to be just naming off things that come to mind. <br /> <br />7. Soil (5/5) On the surface it seems to be a song about a man who commits suicide by shooting himself. I may be reading too much into it, but it seems to me to be about a man who has joined the military despite the pleading of his friends and family and the mourning that takes place when he is killed. <br /> <br />8. War? (5/5) About war in the holy land. Religious in it's message as Serj's soaring voice screams \\"We will fight the heathens!\\"  <br /> <br />9. Mind (4/5) An unusually long song clocking in at six minutes and sixteen seconds. The theme is clear if you listen to the words.... mind control, with Daron saying \\"Free thinkers are dangerous\\" and Serj finishing the song instructing us all to \\"Look at each other\\" in a soft whisper. <br /> <br />10.  Peephole (4/5) A song about being high on pot and how in the mind of the law it is worse than being drunk when in fact drunken drivers kill thousands more than stoned ones. <br /> <br />11. CUBErt (3/5) Another truly bizarre song where again it seems Tankian is just rambling whatever comes to mind. <br /> <br />12. Darts (3/5) Speaking of a world with more than one god, Tankian says that a hitman and a nun are lovers and that his gods are Ninti and Ishkur. <br /> <br />13. P.L.U.C.K. (4/5) Meaning Politically Lying, Unholy, Cowardly Killers, this song is about the Armenian Genocide in 1915 when the Turkish government killed thousands of innocent Armenians over a land dispute. <br /> <br />Peace to all. Enjoy!
6300274187|4.0|a good movie i liked it better when i was little but it's still good the songs are rather fun, andrews and dyke were a cute couple that's to about it for this movie, have a SUPERCALIFRAJELISTICEXPEALALIIDOSES day (if that's how you spell correctly)
B0006V6TMG|5.0|I have all Jesse's CDs and enjoy them all.  this one is different.  While I can still enjoy his phenominal guitar playing and varied source of songs, there is a ton of percussion in this piece and the live audience really enlivens his work.  I listen to most of his music and enjoy it immensely,this one I crank up in the car!
0440180295|4.0|Poor Billy and his torn life.  War is never pretty, and Vonnegut does wonderfully to depict a human being and what happens after war has shattered his mind.  In this wonderfully simply written yet complex plot we get to tour through Billy's mind and discover who he is and where he has come from.   <br /> <br />With it all starting at war he broke down from the stress and eventually went to a hospital where he read sci-fi books at a critical moment of recovery.  It is at this time that his imagination, or should I say insanity from the war, takes over and begins to create a more comfortable world for him to live in. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book a lot.  It is always fun to see an author depict a person's mind and show you how they came to be who they are.  What makes it even more fun is the fact that the mind we are seeing is insane from the war, which makes it all the better.  I would recommend to anyone.  Not a difficult read, but it sure is a fun one.
B000003N8G|1.0|The sample segments on the website are misleading.  Virtually every cut on the CD is very dissonant... not what I would have expected from the website sampler.
B00008O89K|5.0|When we're all dead and forgotten this masterpiece will be played and played forever, like Mozart and Beethoven is today. Basil Poledouris managed to compose the most grand, wagnerian, unpologetic, huge masterpiece ever - words can not besrive what I feel whenever I listen to this tour de force. I'm in total awe. I'm speechless. This is not only the best film score ever, but perhaps the best piece of classical music ever written.
B00097A5I6|4.0|\\"Let there be love\\" is my favourite. But the whole album is good to give you emotions.
B00064VR0W|5.0|100% recomendations on this concert, great audio, great image and of course Rod Stewart's best hits. His band is magnificent and the duo with Ron Wood and Chrissie Hynde, phenomenal.
0307236722|5.0|This is a great help and a must in your kitchen library, specially if you like to know more about bakery.  <br />This book provides a great help with the use of the equipment, and the selection of the recepies is excelent. The pictures are great, you will regret if you don't have this book.
B000BCKFWK|1.0|I WOULD'VE GIVEN THIS MOVIE 5 STARS, AND DECLARED IT THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME WERE IT NOT FOR JESSICA ALBA'S REFUSAL TO GET NAKED.  THIS ABSOLUTELY RUINED THE INTEGRITY AND THE BELIEVABILITY OF THE FILM.  FIRST OF ALL, SHE WAS NAKED IN THE COMIC BOOK, AND ABSOLUTELY ANY CHANGE IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IMMORAL.  SECOND, AS IT IS, THE STRIPPERS IN SIN CITY ARE ACTUALLY DRESSED IN A LESS SUGGESTIVE MANNER THAN THE WOMEN THAT ARE JUST STANDING AROUND.  WHAT THE HELL SORTA SENSE DOES THAT MAKE?  ANYWAY, RODRIGUEZ SHOULDA CANNED HER WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT SHE WOULDN'T DO IT AND FOUND SOMEONE ELSE WHO WOULDA GOTTEN NAKED.  NAKED AS HELL.  HAD HE DONE THAT IT WOULD INDEED HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER, BUT AS IT STANDS IT IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER. WHAT A SHAME.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Under the perspective of thirty elapsed years, to judge this movie is like make a journey through the past, noticing the terror schemes were far away the modern concepts.<br /><br />From the bestseller of Peter Blenchey, Spileberg made the greatleap with this simple story, ornamented with thetypical figures; the good good guy (Roy Scheider), the bad good guy (Robert Shaw), who will undertake an unexhaustive search behind this marine beast, a shark that literrraly maintains scared the most of people in this sea coast.<br /><br />The special effects at that moment and the suspenseful atmosphere are of first rate. This movie is now part of the legend, and the first artistic triumph for Spieleberg.<br /><br />The best of the saga, without any doubt.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Some fool named \\"cr izbee\\" said that Jimi Hendrix and Stervie Ray Vaughan are bad guitarists YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND 2 OF THE BEST!  Jimi Hendrix rules and you all should go out and buy all of his albums.
B0000041Z3|4.0|I bought this set due my huge respect for Sibelius music. The combined presence of that beloved Orchestra and Lorin Maazel were two great poles of attraction, but at the end the final result was -pitifully- quite irregular.<br /><br />Let me put on this way; Maazel is outstanding in the First Symphony with two important references; De Sabata New york and Stokowski with the Royal Philharmonic (1977); the Second belongs to Anthony Collins (forget about it any other recording ever made; this is a supreme musical document); the Third has in Collins another serious contender, the Fourth has several and succesful performances: the sublime version of Tomas Beecham, Segerstam, Leonard  Bernstein and Ashkenazy.<br /><br />The Five is weak, and the jewel of the crown is the Sixth Symphony. The Seventh finds Koussevitzkly and Beecham again.<br /><br />But for all Sibelius fans it is absolutely recommended to make their own conclusions.
6305428220|5.0|I love this movie, it is smart, gripping, a little predicatable but a really good movie.This is one of my fav movies,I mean you got Elijah Wood, Josh Hartnett, Usher,Clea Duvall and all others, just get this movie,you will enjoy it.
B0007PAMR4|3.0|My review isn't for those who want to know the plot.  I'm basically going to point out the things missing (yes, MISSING) in the EXTENDED version!   Most noticable is the removal of all of Princess Irulan's opening monologue to be replaced instead with a male voice-over narration accompanying STORY BOARD DRAWINGS (high tech, huh) - though to be fair they show a copy of the book before doing so, making it a \\"fairy tale come to life\\" effect, I guess.  The dialogue of the Spacing Guild Navigator is drastically changed, and notice all the \\"Lynchian\\" industrial steam \\"psst!\\" sound effects are gone.  The Baron's doctor no longer tells his Baron about his \\"lovely diseases\\" - too gruesome for TV?  Which I guess explains the cutting of the scene where the Baron kills someone by pulling out his heart plug and much later when the Bene Geserits bleed orally when Paul drinks the water of life.  I'm sure I missed much more. <br /> <br />Perhaps THAT is part of the reason why it is STILL listed as an Alan Smithee film and NOT a Lynch film.  There opening certainly did not seem like anything he'd like.  And he's often explained cut scenes that he liked as being \\"too much of a good thing.\\" <br /> <br />My first exposure to Dune was on TV way back.  When I later rented the theatrical version I was let down because it seemed everything was rushed from the time Paul meets the Fremen and trains them and they attack, but the two main things I remember missing was the scene where they extract water from the dead man and the water of life from a baby worm.  Funny the stuff you remember.  But the most powerful scene missing from BOTH versions is when Paul weeps after killing the Fremen he fought (I can't remember why he was challenged to do so - honor or something).  Now that I see it I can't help thinking it was familiar and originally in the TV version. <br /> <br />The crew talk about Lynch and he is scene in many photos, but Lynch himself gives no interviews, as he did so extensively forhis early short films and Eraserhead, so it seems he is still avoiding this film and wanted no part in its rerelease.  I would have liked to hear him reminisce about this one, his most hollywood-cast-of-a-thousand of films, his \\"Spartacus.\\"  Oh well.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This movie has several layers, not all of which were apparent to me at first viewing. <br /> <br />On a surface level, it's an outstanding romantic comedy, where Bill Murray's cynical character has to live the same day over and over.  It's time travel back to the same day.  It's all done very humorously.  Yet as you peel away the layers, and look deeper there is a profound message to be discovered.   <br /> <br />Have you ever felt stuck in your life, and no matter what you do, it does not seem to make any difference. You get frustrated, desperate, even depressed.  Then you make a decision to solve the problem no matter what.  This movie is a metaphor for self improvement.   Phil's journey is our journey. <br /> <br />So, we see the journey this character takes from cynical, sarcastic and negative, and self absorbed, and not likable.  Then he is presented with the same situations over and over and is forced to adapt, or be forever stuck. <br /> <br />Some of the lessons here include: you create your own experiences, so when you change your perceptions you change your reality, the transforming power of true love, all change comes from within.  When you change your view of the world from being cynical selfish, and exploitive to truly loving and compassionate, the world responds to that change, and so do people. <br /> <br />The character does play with the day on a surface level at first, and eventually improves how the day goes, although he has certain aspects under control, other issues such as how to seduce the Andie McDowell character remain elusive, because his motives are transparent.  The movie keeps going in interesting and amusing ways.   <br /> <br />In the latter part of the movie he is saving the same person's life every day, he has gone from not playing piano to a professional standard piano player. Of Course, he has also kidnapped a groundhog, but that was just a phase.  In the end, he masters his reality, and is ready to move on. <br /> <br />You will think about it for a long time afterwards.  I consider this to be Bill Murray's best movie, and I highly recommend it. <br />  <br />If you were to find this review helpful, please click yes. <br />
