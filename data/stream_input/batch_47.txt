B001V7UXG2|5|I have read this book three times and still laugh. I am a fan of the TV series so I can \\"hear\\" Bertie or Jeeves in the voices of Hugh Laurie and Stephen Frye. PG Wodehouse is a wonderful writer. His skill in turning a phrase or drawing a verbal comparison is fabulous and always witty. If you aren't familiar with his writing pick anything he's written and you will be hooked. There are also DVD versions of these stories and it adds to the fun to see them acted out.
B000FC2L1Y|5|Good sense of family
B009ZQC7MY|5|Enthralling show. The last episode was totally unexpected. I wish there were more episodes per season. Looking forward to season 4!

B0058UXHHK|5|I really enjoyed this novel it had a reality blended with some mysteries and close to heart messages at times. I would recommend readers to enjoy this as I have.
B002MQYOFW|5|I resisted reading this book because of all the hype surrounding it. The eternal pessimist that I am, I told myself that a teen novel can't be that good. Well, there a first time for everything. I was wrong. This is an amazing book! The writing, the imagery, the emotion that the two invoke caught me off guard. I literally could not put it down.
B0089LOG02|5|Really enjoyed this book
B0058YPGSY|5|Ron Pearlman, Katie Segal, Charlie Hunnam and more twists and turns than a sidewinders' trail.  It doesn't get any better than this for a recent series, period!
B008XG1X18|5|I really like this App
014028009X|4|Enter the world of Bridget Jones. Shes is a 30 year old singleton whose life is a whirlpool of dates with men, late nights out with friends, and endless dinner parties with the smug marrieds. The book takes place over the time span of one year, and throughout the year you see the changes that Bridget slowly goes through. The book takes you into her mind, and you get to see why she does the things she does. Bridget Jones's Diary is a very entertaining and funny book that gives you a fresh look of the life of Bridget. It is very real and honest. I really enjoyed reading this book and I found myself laughing out loud and staying up late to find out what would happen next.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I love how things are discovered as the trial progresses.  Jake was the attorney we had met in Time to Kill!  The fact that everyone won in the end was a good resolution!
B00000JGHM|5|One of my favorite movies of all time!  Very well written with a surprise ending.
0345535529|5|Absolutely amazing, George R.R. Martin successfully tells the stories of many characters with little confusion involved.
B00MB6IYHW|5|Probably the best, in my opinion, marvel movie! A combination of action and comedy that combines perfectly! A must see! It's the type of movie to watch over and over again!

B00005OCMR|5|Flynn is a programmer, and runs an arcade. He should be a rich games developer, but a man at his old company, Dillenger, stole all his programming and sold the rights himself. Since then, Flynn's been trying to hack into Dillenger's system, to prove that he wrote the games. Dillenger's also written over an old chess program, turning it into a security system that can think for itself and absorb other programs into itself, growing smarter. While hacking after hours for a friend down at his old company, the system catches Flynn and transforms him into data, sending him into the computer. Inside the computer, there is a society, with programs as people, graphics as landscapes, sprites as vehicles and  games are duels to the death. Will Flynn make it out? <br /> <br />It's a special film, Tron. The way it was animated, the design and the \\"landscapes\\". Jeff Bridges handles himself pretty well as Flynn, too. Special features on the second disc of this edition include a whole series of documentaries and animation demos, which were interesting context, I thought. <br /> <br />Recommended for fans of unique animation.
B008OOYALE|5|Its free and the dragons are so cute! The hard part for me though was expanding and clearing of the trees. But all n's all its a great game.
B0047WJ12K|4|This was a really good movie. I liked the part when the inception happened. It was really mind blowing and cool.

B00EMXBDMA|5|Science fiction with a smart character,  great story, and hard science. You can't beat that.
B007IXWKUK|5|good story line
B008JGSM6G|2|This looked like a really fun game, but the formatting is such that i can't see the far left row in the smallest puzzles. Combined with the fact that it is very hard to connect that row as well made the game unplayable.
B007PTJOV0|5|This game is so much fun. Like other reviewers ststed its like Mario. This is the best arcade game I have doenloaded on my Kindle by far. And you can't go wrong with the price. The ads are not bothersome like some free games I have tried.
0525478817|5|This is the best book I've read in a long time. If i had the time i would have finished it in one day, although i didn't want it to end! I'm 25 and I haven't read a 'young adult' book since maybe middle/high school and i loved it. I was immersed in the story since the first chapter. John Green is an amazing writer. I found myself re-reading some sentences and dialogue because they were absolutely brilliant. The bad reviews on here don't really make any sense. Sure they don't talk like normal 16 year olds and if they did..what would the book be? It wouldn't be anything. It's different and that's what I LOVED about it. It wasn't meant to be realistic. I can agree with some people on the Peter Van Holten plot (especially towards the end) and the fake cigarette thing but still a great book that I will definitely read again.
B00B2JSRAS|5|Easy read. Love the excercises
B0063IH60K|5|great gameplay and graphics . I could play this game again and again and again ana again and again an one more thing this game is.awesome

B008Y212PI|5|A great way to pass the time.  The puzzles are not hard but are entertaining.  Also enjoyed the colorful graphics.
B001Q9J4PG|4|Typical Clancy book. A little shallow on the characters but a great action read. Lots of info for military techies. Interesting take on crazy environmental terrorists.
B00AEJM6H2|5|I absolutely love this game! I am definitely hooked! The arcade part is very fun, and I'm really liking the mineral one right now too. I haven't gotten to the rest of them yet but I'm sure they're great.
B0071XO8RA|5|I wish there was more detail about who made the silos etc. I will read more of Hugh's books for sure!
B007ZGO7EM|4|Plain easy to see and daughter likes it
B009UX2YAC|5|Here is another game that our children have enjoyed. They tell me that this is a lot of fun and they enjoy their time playing this Subway Surfers game.
B004XVN1T4|4|This was a good read. A fast-paced yarn that held this reader's interest to the last page.
1416563156|5|This is a great book if you are an Indiana Jones fan. The imitation leather is of good quality and the illustrations are really cool, the book overall is awesome. I would recommend this to everyone.
B002T9H2LK|4|This review is for; [[ASIN:B002T9H2LK Inglourious Basterds (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />It seems every time we hear of an upcoming Quentin Tarantino movie we are expecting a  Kill Bill or Planet Terror type film filled with mindless violence and gruesome, grotesque scenes. It seems Inglouirus Basterds might follow suit after seeing the trailers, but somehow I felt pleasantly surprised after watching it and satisfied. Perhaps other viewers expecting much more action may hate it or get impatient with it. About half or more of the film is in French or German with English subtitles while the remaining parts are spoken with some English language.<br /><br />Set in fictionally France during the German Nazi occupation, a Jewish woman named Shosanna Drefus (Melanie Laurent) flees after her family is massacred by Nazis led by Colonel Landa who is a Nazi SS Officer nicknamed the \\"Jewish Hunter\\" (played brilliantly by actor Christopher Waltz). She would later come to ownership of a small theater under a different identity were she quietly befriends a German soldier named private Fredrick Zoller (Daneil Bruhl) who turns out to be a German hero because of his antics as a skilled sniper. A Nazi sniper who  single handedly fought off an Allied onslaught on his own. The German hero has a film made about him called \\"Nation's Pride\\" exploiting his heroics that will be privately viewed by some of the most high ranking Nazis including the Furer Adolf Hitler himself. The film will be shown at Shosanna's theater at the personal request of Private Zoller. Shosanna sees this as an opportunity to lock the building with everybody inside during the film viewing and kill them all as a great act of revenge for her slain family.<br /><br />At the same time we are introduced to Lieutenant Aldo (an offering of comic relief by Brad Pitt) who assembles a band of Jewish Americans soldiers bent out on wrecking havoc behind German lines killing Nazis disguised as civilians. His protocol, take no prisoners and collect 100 Nazi scalps (literally)! Eventually a double agent posing as a German actress meets up with Aldo's private commando basterds and learns of the Nazi gathering at the theater also. They plan to infiltrate and set off explosives at the theater unaware of Shoshanna's intent to burn the theater down.<br /><br />The title of the movie and the theatrical trailers I felt were very misleading because the commando Basterds were not really the main element of the movie which may turn out to disappoint a lot of people. Brad Pitt's character Lt. Aldo is not even the main character as I felt he was more of a third leading character behind the Jewish woman Shosanna & Colonel Landa. I have to admit, I laughed every time Brad Pitt spoke with his heavy, Tennesee Southern accent speaking lines like \\"We are in the Nazi killing business and cousin, business is booming!\\" Be prepared for a lot of dialogue which I felt was excessive at times like other reviewers have complained about given the almost 2.5 hour run time, but it all comes together in the end with a flourish. The fate of Adolf Hitler reminded me that this film was again fiction. I enjoyed IB for what it was and appreciated as a somewhat ambitious effort for Tarantino compared to his previous efforts in the action packed Kill Bills. I enjoyed it more in a Jackie Brown sort of way. Recommended, but I'm just not sure everybody can appreciate it the same way!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES.<br /><br />Extended and alternate scenes \\"Lunch with Goebbels\\", \\"La Louisiana Card Game\\" & \\"Nation's Pride Begins\\".<br />Nation's Pride (6 minutes 11 seconds); The complete propaganda film.<br />Four trailers including the American version & 3 international.<br />Roundtable Discussion with Tarantino, Brad Pitt & Elvis Mitchell (30 minutes 44 seconds).<br />The Making of Nation's Pride (4 minutes).<br />The Original Inglourious Basterds (7 minutes 39 seconds) notes about the original 1978 version.<br />A conversationwith Rod Taylor (6 minutes 44 seconds).<br />Rod Taylor on Victoria Bitter ( 3 minutes 20 seconds).<br />Quentin Tarantino's Camera Angel (2 minutes 42 seconds).<br />Hi Sallys (2 minutes 10 seconds).<br />Film Poster Gallery Tour with Elvis Mitchell (11 minutes).<br />Poster Gallery (37 still images).<br /><br />Also, Best Buy is offering a third bonus disc featuring a 60-minute interview with Quentin Taratino if you purchase either the two disc DVD or Blue Ray set.

B002LFPAUC|5|Ken Burns sets a new standard for historical documentaries that has influenced the genre to match his craft.  The use of professional actors to provide voice to the actual letters written by participants brings to life poingancy of the war that still shapes our nation.  His artristic movement of the camera over still photos brings realism to a war without th benefit of motion photography footage.  The research for the presentation is exhaustive and comprehensive.  This documentary should be required viewing for everyone wanting an understanding of the scope and magnitude of this civil war that was in no way civil in preserving the4 United States.  I recommend it for anyone whether middle school student, ordinaary citizen, or academic scholar.
B00EEDJHXA|4|This is the new favorite challenge. Fun for a wide range of ages. Sometimes the scissors don't cut when I want them to.
B009POCG2C|5|This movie was a great family movie for our Sunday Night Movie Night. It appealed to all ages and was highly entertaining.
B009KS4XRO|5|Fun addictive game. Enjoyable for adults. Would not recommend for children. Variety of choices to play for adults. Love it.
B004T4LUPW|5|I received my Kindle Fire HD 4G LTE on November 26, 2012 and just love it. It is amazing, especially with the 4G LTE and GPS Features. I was working on my Google calendar and after input, I checked my Calengoo App on my Kindle Fire and everything was there, and surprise, surprise, the map that appears at the Where box (for the event) shows up, along with a voice navigation selection. And the lady's voice is very nice too. You can be in your car and have your Kindle Fire beside you and she will talk you through the directions. See Cynthia Marr's book [[ASIN:B006JH3VXG Using Amazon Cloud, Kindle Fire's Gallery & Google Calendar With WiFi Connection Only]] for more information in using your Google Calendar with the Calengoo app.<br /><br />Previously with the Calengoo app, my legacy Kindle Fire had all the same features of syncing with my Google calendar; however, there is no voice navigation selection. A map is provided for the Where (location of the event) which has always been pretty neat.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|This is absolutely one of the best novels I've ever read. I loved everything about this book. The amazing tale itself - I think it's genius to have come up with it. The characters - I felt I truly knew each and every one. The suspense. And I always love a tale that takes place in another country. After the first few chapters, I almost wrote down the name of each character with little reminders as to who each were - I could not imagine keeping them all straight, could not fathom how their lives could possibly be intertwined. Suddenly, though, they all clicked into place. You will find yourself grappling with how the secret was ultimately handled - i.e. accountability for a terrible action. I found the author's Epilogue absolutely astounding - just when I didn't think the book could end any better. Talk about a book that will stay with you long after you've finished it.
B003H4I4JU|4|It was a little confusing to read at times.  I had to read it slower than I normal would have.  It wasn't as interesting as the first book.  But all in all it was a good book.
B0054JZC6E|3|in my opinion some of the games are fun but they require way too many points to unlock. takes way too much time to get going
B00I6IKSZ0|5|It has mincraft people with shooting its just so fun to me and my whole family and my friends.<br />Play the game
B001EN71DG|5|This was given as a gift.  I have not heard if it works or the quality of the DVD's.  I was however, pleased with the way it arrived in a timely fashion.  I was able to give it as a Christmas  gift.
B004SIIBGU|1|I am very disappointed, buy the Amazon Fire phone and the camera stops working in a few days. Besides they do not have good apps in their store, and if I do not buy the music you can download, not even my own computer !! Failure phone, I hate it.
0061537969|2|#1.A 12 year old should NOT have read this book.  #2 This book drained me, too many emotional upheavals.  #3.Forced myself to read it because a book club member picked it.  #4.Too easy to predict the end.  #5.I have a dog who is 12 years old and I love her, but seriously she's a DOG.
B0094ZJK4O|5|Richie did not disappoint with his new cd. If you like his solo music you will generally like this new album. It is a little different than some of his earlier works but there is such a range in this cd of his own unique styles that it is hard for anyone not to love it. Alternatively, you can get a free single from his website as a preview of what his music is like on the album. That is what I did before purchasing. I love it and i'm glad I purchased his music.
B00RFHUSN0|5|Excellent movie for either adults or children. Meryl Street is a very good actress.
B001OGWY1W|5|This Movie is a master piece.
B00FRQ32N4|5|I CAN'T GET IT but it is super
B008Y78AO4|4|The final installment is not beyond the first but nonetheless a classic that is awesome.
B0058YPGSY|5|its as great as season 1,2,&3. we can sit and watch it over and over and never get tired of it. my better half could watch it all the time if i let him ,exspecially when theres nothing easle good on tv
B004132HZS|5|When the backlogged bobbies of 21st-Century London call out for someone to put crime to rights, they call who they always have: Sherlock Holmes.  This series packs the emotional heft, intellectual challenge, and derring-do that Doyle invested in his original characters, but resets it amid current technological chaos, social upheaval, and sexual politics.  Purists might balk (they always do), but Moffett and Gattis present us worthy addition to Holmes' mythology.<br /><br />The stories upend Doyle's original, sometimes reversing what we expect, sometimes taking Doyle's Victorian conceits into our web age.  Three feature-length episodes take us through changes more intense than a one-hour drama could approach, including the ambiguities inherent in characters like Sherlock, played with chilling incisiveness by Benedict Cumberbatch, and Watson, a character that coaxes unexpected depth from comic actor Martin Freeman.<br /><br />Beyond the mysteries, this makes for good character drama, with extremes of human behavior and trust put on the rack.  This elicits moments of unexpected but grim humor, touched with a certain gloom that doesn't quite lapse into abject pessimism.  Too infrequently do we see as complex and multi-layered a story as we have presented to us here, and since we have only three episodes, we still have it in short supply.
B005DJREGQ|4|It's an entertaining and funny show. Especially if you like teen comedy and some minor drama.
B00EMXBDMA|5|The story is compelling, the characters feel real, and you can learn something while being entertained. What's not to like?
B00003CXE7|4|I read these reviews and see people talking about the gore factor. I was impressed by this movie that with the title it had and hollywood's obsession with gore just for the sake of gore that there wasn't more then there was.The big difference here to me was that they didn't mull over the bloody scenes and glorify them. But what really surprised me about this movie was the way it pulled me in and made me feel,mainly due to the very crafty way in which the scenes were composed, and of course, the talent of the main actor.Anyone remember how the first &quot;Mad Max&quot; movie made them feel? Small budget, big on emotion. Next came Road Warrior- bigger budget, less emotion, then they plopped down that feeble excuse Beyond Thunderdome- biggest budget, flat on emotion. What I'm trying to say here is that Gladiator and it's Director deserve a standing ovation just for being able to pull off a big budget film that still packs a heavy payload of emotion rather then just &quot;wowing&quot; you with a glossy package of special effects. It is well worth the 3 hours it takes to watch this movie.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I was searching for vids to watch. I found that DanTDM had made a new vid. To my surprise it was entertaining and seemed addicting to play. Than about a year later, the guy I used to be subbed to was made a cross road vid. I finally decided to download the app. I was right, it was entertaining and addicting. I love the simple commands and I can play it for hours and not get board. So you people out there, deciding if to download this app I recommend you do.
B003PFWX0W|5|This was a Christmas gift for my son. He loves listening to the songs and is really enjoying the vinyl record experience. For me, a walk down memory lane.
B004MC8CA2|4|It works much better now. Most of the bugs have been fixed...it's the only Bible I use now.
B00HXYKYIE|5|great book, surprise ending
B00LU0P9L4|4|Enjoying the suspense of searching a ghost ship and interacting with the inhabitants. Also like the fact that there are voices with the involvement with the ghosts. Thanks
B00IXF85CY|3|A good story, great acting and creative design.<br />But, stories of fate without hope leave me disappointed yet inspired to raise the question again and again, &#34;what if we do live forever?&#34;
B00N35P5MW|4|Spatial relations made fun. Yeehaw!
B008BUK0XI|5|Love Tom Cruise and all the Mission Impossible movies. This one will not disappoint the viewer. If you love action, you will love this movie.
6305090564|5|Delived as promised - A movie about stupid rich people, crazed pirate psychos and a Lovecraft looking sea beast.  What's not to like? Make more.
B008FYZIVY|5|Unbelievably great, I never enjoyed anything so much as this. It is truly a Masterpiece, great actors, great characters and beautiful settings, Mossy
B005K0HDGE|5|Like all his books this one is very descriptive.<br />It really takes you to the time.<br />Enjoyed the book and I learned some history
0345803485|5|I bought this product for a friend. I really can't rate it as I am not the one reading it. My friend was happy with it.
0452295548|5|Don't let my avatar name confuse you. I seldom bother to write about the good stuff, but, this book is really something special. As the wife and caregiver of a 57 year old who suffered a \\"dreaded\\" stroke in his pons, a very small, but vital part of the brain stem with many critical functions, this book taught me things that were invaluable to my becoming the best caregiver possible. For those of us lucky enough not have had a stroke, we can all expect in some time in our lives to know, be related to, or be the caregiver to someone who has had to go through it. And this goes for any and all brain injuries, not just strokes. It includes the thousands of soldiers, sailors and marines who have come home with traumatic brain injuries, diagnosed and not.  It includes victims of senseless gun violence, like Gabby Giffords, and unfortunately, many more like her. Being able to understand just a little bit better what they are going through, can really help us with cultivating the overwhelming patience necessary to be the best friends and caregivers available. If you feel frustrated, just try to imagine how frustrated they are. Don't finish that sentence for them. Bite your tongue off first. Give them the time and encouragement to regain and relearn, and don't be afraid of that different person that they may become.<br />We did start therapy to help his recovery, long before the medical profession. For the first 3 days, he was confined to his bed, but, I constantly rubbed and massaged his right side to send messages to his brain from those stricken muscles, so the brain would be reminded that they were still there.  We started occupational therapy by me drawing spirals and other shapes that he attempted to trace.  We are almost to a point where I might frame one and hang it on the wall. Not too painful to look at anymore. I am also a poetry freak. I love it and memorize many very long poems. So, I picked out Edgar Allen Poe's \\"The Raven\\". I would recite a line and he would recite it back to me. Several days later, when he was transferred to an in-hospital rehab unit, I printed several copies, in large print, and several of the speech therapists used it with several other patience. It's a good poem for that as it's language is fairly modern, and it seems to have most of the different sounds made in the English language. We were very lucky, and it helps that my husband has always been a driven personality type.  The first day home, even though he still had severe balance problems and needed his walker, he started \\"running\\", well shuffling really, down our narrow hallway. he could steady himself with hands on the walls, but, he kept at it. Several days later, he was doing the same shuffling, sort of run, with the walker, up to and around the cul-de-sac, across from our house. The neighbors thought he was crazy, but, he was just retraining his partially paralyzed right side, that it could still run.<br />It's now seven years since his stroke and he constantly floors the medical profession, that he survived and made so much of a recovery (I estimate 98%). One thing to absolutely remember about any brain injury, when the brain needs to rest, you should not, you can not fight it. Sleep and rest are as essential as air and water.<br />Thank you, Jill Bolte Taylor. I hope your newer right/left brain collaboration continues to bring you much new joy and experience, and I will forever be grateful for your amazing sharing of your most inner self and the story you had to tell.
0783217048|5|This movie is one of those rare perfect films. Casting is brilliant (especially Stockard Channing, who only gets better and better as the years go by--and she was always totally incapable of less than a fantastic  performance). The general plotline of the movie is congenial, and the  themes are fulfilling.<br />In essence, the movie deals with the healing of  &quot;broken people.&quot; (For other such films, see such gems as  &quot;Batteries Not Included&quot; and &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes.&quot;)  The unlikely angels? Three drag queens from New York City. The vehicle?  Their car breaks down in a red-neck hamlet. Unlikely hijinks and dangerous  confrontations lead to a thoroughly satisfying finale.<br />And Julie Newmar  was never better!
B00KFG156C|5|I love this book. It has many twists and turns which leads to a great experience. This is a book I would definitely read many times without getting bored of it.
B003L77G10|5|This is a suprise series and even if you have had the chance to see it in broadcast buy the DVDs, spend the time watching the micro and the macro, something new to delight everytime.
B007SOQBCM|5|It closes randomly sometimes,other thAn that.  Good stuff.
B007J4T2G8|5|Love it!!! Can not put this book down!!! I'm such a fan of this trilogy, I recommend it to all the ladies a must read:-)
B00FGEOA9M|5|Very tense and exciting can't wait for the next Season.
B007B5EDEG|5|Definitely hard to put down, worthy of rereading and I look forward to the next two books
B000GIXLO8|5|Very pleased with my purchase of The Two Towers extended edition. I can't get over how many important details were revealed in this edtion. I really thought the Ent's battle with Saruman at Isengard was awesome,along with the burial scene in Rohan of Theodon's son and what happened to the retreating orcs at the battle of Helms deep. I could spend all day going over every detail but I think you get my point. i just finshed reading the LOTR's and I think the film version of The Two Towers in particular this extended edition was better than the literary version. A few years ago I was kinda ho hum about this trilogy but now I'm really a fan. I would say anyone interested in the LOTR'S should buy this edition.
0694013013|5|I purchased this as a gift for my friend's son. He loves it, and the nice thing about is that it is super durable. Board books like this one is the only way to go! And Eric Carle is the BEST children's author!
B003TSEEDY|5|This book is a very moving emotional experience.  The scenarios and experiences that are conveyed are very intense and unsettling.  However, there is an almost childlike naive, but clear, view of serious adult themes and emotional issues that is refreshing.  Not for people who cant deal with complex issues, but is very insightful for those who want to look into some heavy topics.
B00B2PHSIY|5|I bought this filter for my honeymoon in St Lucia where I had the opportunity to scuba dive several times.  I am completely amazed with how well this filter corrected the missing red light at 40ft below.  When combined with ProTune setting & a manual adjustment for White color balance (eye dropper tool in Cineform) I was able to quickly bring my underwater footage to its full HD beauty. Definitely worth the $. Also, very easy to correct the ample red from the filter for any footage taken at the surface as well.<br /><br />TIP: For best performance you should attach the filter while both camera housing and filter are dry.  It makes a tight seal and will trap any moisture between the two if applied while damp or when submerged during a dive.
B00BLF9FOK|5|I really loved this movie. My 22 year old son said it didn't do very well at the box office; maybe it was because Arnold had been out of the movies for eight years. This movie must have been one of the first movies; he did after being California Governor. Personally, I voted for him. Maybe it was his divorce; who cares! No one is perfect in this world; we all sin. That said: Arnold plays a sheriff, like no other. Luis Guzm&aacute;n, plays a latin deputy. Forest Whitaker plays agent, trying to capture a criminal. There was a character, who stocked up all kinds of weapons; he was funny and he named his guns. I thought their was enough action, to kept me going through the entire movie. I liked the car race between the two cars. I didn't like the FBI female Agent in the car with the wanted criminal. PLEASE! What happen to average-looking or plain authority women on the job? I liked the scene in the diner with those old people. Old people can be so funny! We like the funny lines that Arnold Schwarzenegger says, in his movies.<br />No sex, no nudity - is a big plus. I would definitely recommend this movie and Escape Plan (movie). If you are a true fan, like me, you will love this movie, too. I seen it several times!
1451675046|3|All the same great content as the illustrated version, without all the pretty pictures. I accidentally bought this instead of the illustrated one... I ended up gifting it. It's still a good book, but my kids like pictures... and so do I.
B006LSZECO|5|Amy is a cold & calculating murderous. She knew it & like it. The ways she sought revenge was diabolical. Smart & cold girl. Flynn is a fine writer who keeps you turning pages. Will now start &#34;Sharp Objects&#34;, & can't wait.
1451627289|3|I admit to buying whatever the NY Times tells me to buy, and so I accept the blame when something goes terribly wrong.  However, if just one person is saved from making the same mistake with 11/22/63, this review will have been worth writing.  According to King, borrowing from Norman Mailer, the most appalling aspect of the Kennedy assassination is the apparent randomness in the universe that allowed an insignificant man to accomplish an unthinkably powerful, destructive act.  So far, so good.  However, the problem for me in 11/22/63 (and King's other books) stems from King's reliance on mysticism, hunches, harmonies, coincidences, fate, etc., to not only advance the plot, but as the premise for the plot, as the source of various conflicts and obstacles, and then as the resolution to those same issues.  This is the definition of arbitrary.  For example, if the Past is \\"obdurate\\" enough to shatter the wheel of the hero's car en route to prevent the assassination, why would the Past provide another conveniently parked car with the keys practically hanging from the mirror?  King's answer is that the past \\"harmonizes.\\"  My thinking is that the Past could save a lot of trouble by not shattering the wheel in the first place.  A much simpler answer that has the benefit of making sense is that the Past operates in this contradictory manner for the purpose of contriving a moderately entertaining action sequence at the end of a novel.  The randomness of the Kennedy assassination accounts for its fascination, but the same meaninglessness in 11/22/63 is silly.  The difference is that we absolutely know that the first story took place, but it's King's job to convince us that the second story did.  If you already like Stephen King, 11/22/63 will probably not disappoint.  But, that doesn't mean that the NY Times should recommend it as one of the top five books of 2011!
0385486804|4|A very intering read.
B009PK9SB8|4|Snaps right in, comes with its own case door, and a spare.  Decent enough color and clarity to show off what I've been up up.  it does burn through some battery though, and the touch input isn't as good as my phone or tablet, but passable.
B00B2JSRAS|2|There are nine 'experiments'. The first involves putting a wish 'out there' to the FP (you'll find out what FP is when you read the book) and one should get a response within 48hrs.<br />I did and I'm still waiting, 3 weeks later. First experiment failed, is it even worth doing the rest!<br />The author knows/has read/has been told a bit about quantum mechanics and tries to use QM to justify an all encompassing &#34;force'. Physics terms like 'force' and 'fields' are used completely out of context, I tried ignoring these obvious errors and read on but in the end I concluded that the book had little substance.<br />Anyway, book has some (a few) good titbits but the overall theme leaves much to be desired.
B009AYVNEY|2|Kinda boring in spots. Not easy to follow.
B00632HWOG|1|Since the 12/2012 update, my yahoo mail app is unusable. It doesn't load half the time and when it does it freezes as soon as I do anything on it. If I try to delete emails, it says they're gone then crashes and my inbox is full again. This update is crap! Please fix it!
B00DJFIMW6|5|I love this game and have it on my kindle. I recently bought my son his own kindle but this is unavailable now?? My son loves this game too....so, will it become available again anytime soon and is there a way to be notified?
B00000FYIL|4|Like the film, the soundtrack tells a deeply emotional story with wit and charm.  Rather than leaving you humming a pop tune (leave that for the vast majority of other soundtracks), it succeeds in creating a complex  multi-level mood; both romantic and triumphant.  This is subtle music,  which manages to get under your skin amidst all the loud cacophany we are  subjected to by the usual entertainment fare.  One could almost catagorize  this as a bridge between the sugary sentimentality of the familiar, and the  sometimes cold intellectual approach of artists such as Philip Glass. Don't  look for period music, here.  Although there are certainly touches  throughout, they are sprinkled in delicately with the occassional  instrument or two joining the wider orchestra.  This soundtrack succeeds,  as does the film, in bridging the centuries.
B001R1PZ9M|4|Our grandchildren really like this; for me it is okay. The action is good and there is comedy, which is always a plus.
0767805712|5|Excellent movie!  Spoiler Alert!  The best scene is near the end when the brothers confront each one final time.  They go for their final competitive swim and the main character states: &#34;I never saved anything for the swim back.&#34;
B008EEB4TA|5|Marina and the diamonds is beautifully catchy and amazing!
B006OOHYIC|5|I love this game.  Even after you solve levels you can still challenge yourself to improve your score.  I also like the hints so you don't get stuck and give up.
B00BP4Z8XY|5|The premise of this movie caught my eye and I couldn't wait to see the film. It was definitely worth the wait. Every aspect of this movie is well done - colors, game like graphics, animation, plot, humor, etc...
B00WSD2BGS|5|Great movie for the kids! No nasty words and only one questionable scene (a man dressed as a women is liked by another man) and one moderately tight fitting dress. My children watched it over an over agin until the rental expired and now want to buy it.
B002VPE1XY|4|When it first arrived I was afraid it was not going to fit my camera... surprise surprise... fits like a glove.<br />Very soft to the touch, smooth.  Little hole on top for the strap... cool.  Not sure how safe the velcro beltstrap is, but camera does not weight much so, I see no problems there.
B0058VW36U|5|I'd been waiting ever since it came out on IOS! I've plowed through all of the levels so far. I can't wait for an update!
B000YMQI6E|5|I liked this movie very much so i bought a bluray for my movie theater at a very good price.Great acting,suspense,and a great story.I would highly recommend it.
B000HBKCDC|5|I really like the renditions Sarah McLachlan does of traditional Christmas carols and her original song is beautiful.  I played it during a holiday party and many of my guests liked and asked about the music and wanted to get one for themselves.  If you like her music you will not be disappointed by this new collection.
B006VRDZ44|4|Good show
B007GCY8FS|3|I've read the whole series, and felt like I'd already read this one when I started it.  Was it a continuation of the book where he wanders around the frozen Nebraska plains and finds a secret bunker complex, or the other book where he wanders around frozen farmland looking for another bunker complex.  I dunno, they are all starting to blend.....
B00338QENI|5|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is the detailed account of one of medicine's greatest achievements and most awkward dilemmas: the growth of the first &#34;immortal&#34; line of human cells and the acquisition of those cells from a poor black woman without her consent.  More than that, however, the book is an examination of the vast, complex history of conflict between African Americans and the medical system, an exploration of uncomfortable ethics and the effect of uninformed consent on research and the patients.  Finally, the book is an intensely human narrative, the story of mother who unknowingly left her children a massive legacy of medical miracles and a pervading sense of violation and injustice, and the story of an inquisitive and eloquent reporter who was determined to ferret out the truth and ended up gaining a new understanding of race, religion, and friendship.<br /><br />Fascinating, well-written, informative, and personal, this book raises important questions and presents a new take on old issues while giving credit to a long-forgotten medical legend.  I couldn't put it down.
B000ICLRIE|5|Simply put this film is one of the best.  The acting, the filming, the music is incredible.  I highly suggest that you see it if you have not already.  I agree with several others here in that I am amazed that it did not do much better when it was in the theaters.
B001EAWMGA|5|I first started noticing information on the film Outlander about a year ago on various Science Fiction sites and began to track it until it's recent DVD release on Amazon.   Apparently something happened causing theatre display that was extremely limited in both Europe and the United States crippling the commercial release of this excellent product. This film has a well written unique plot that works--Aliens---swords---Vikings!! The photography, locations, plot line and Computer Generation are all first rate. James Caviezel displays a particular alien quality which is very,very believable...I believe that the very few flat spots in the film could easily be fixed by a directors cut edition---I would have enjoyed seeing more of Caviezel's retractable body armor and more of the most excellent Ron Pearlman in the film but you cannot have everything....Outlander as it stands is one of the best SF movies I have seen in a long time..I enjoy hunting quality, relatively unknown SF dvd releases such as Outlander, the french SF film Chrysalis, and the upcoming Hunter Prey...Outlander however has been the best, unknown SF film, in recent memory.
1439199388|3|Not particularly well written but interesting account of fist hand experience. Quick read (4-6 hours) and worth the time invested.
B0087WZ436|5|Exceptional journalism by John Hersey and well written too! August 6th, 1945, the bomb dropped and changed the world we live in forever. The gut wrenching ordeal of the common folk in Hiroshima is documented with care. John strikes a balance between being too gory and conveying the gravity of the pain inflicted.<br /><br />The book follows a set of different everyday folks from differing economic and social constructs as they lived life in Hiroshima. It starts on the day the bomb dropped and follows them loosely through for an year. The aftermath of the bomb, its destructive power and its effects are horrifying. The change in the lives of the people, the delay in governmental support and the tenacity of the human spirit to live through is quite touching.  This account was published in the New Yorker magazine in 1946.<br /><br />The author went back after 40 years and added another chapter to his book. Its very interesting how the events of this day shaped the lives of the folks that John Hersey followed. Its a quick read but the content is sobering. Like the cover says - Read it!
B002SSUQFG|2|I've never had a self-winding watch and this one doesn't  fit my needs. I had it for 3 days before sending it back, and it had stopped overnight each of the days I had it. I shook the heck out of it before going to bed each night, but I don't wear it all the time, or every day, so the prospect of reseting the time each day doesn't work for me. Also from reviews I read after the purchase, it sounds like this ain't your father's Seiko:  looses considerable time each day, NOT Japanese made (Malasia), not the best scratch-proof crystal.
B004Q7CIFI|5|Engrossing book! Loved it from beginning to end.
B00688628M|5|Beautiful and realistically done.
B00F031WB8|5|If you are a Jimi Hendrix fan, you should have this DVD. It is simply a wonderful view into Jimi Hendrix and his various bands.
B002UWH8P6|5|The actors, script, sets, are all very good. With 20 episodes per season of great entertainment hard to beat. Try a few episodes you wont be disappointed.
8867322532|5|Perfect!
B007IXWL2C|5|Could not read this fast enough.  Was sad when I finished, it was like I lost touch with a good friend.
B007IXWKUK|5|Some of the scenes become kinda boring,<br /> but besides that some crazy things happen to make up for it! Had me hooked from the beginning.
B0068853O6|3|I found this depiction of the war in Iraq somewhat shallow and the filming is not that great. If this is a true depiction of the modern American soldier then I am not impressed.
B007W8S2MG|5|I'll start off by saying I love the Persona games. Persona 4 for the PS2 was one of my favorite RPG games with turn based fighting. Having the game remade with extras on the PS Vita, where I can play it anywhere at any time, is the best.<br /><br />The story for this game is wonderful and full of mystery (and some death). The characters are great and even comical.<br /><br />Plenty of dungeon crawling and monster battles, some harder than others, to keep you going. :)
B00FG1Q5J8|5|I'm a little bias because this game is completely up my alley. However the system management and fun mini-games for combat really makes this a skillful game. Probably one of the more indepth ones I've played on a mobile platform that isn't over cluttered with everything you don't want in a game of this nature. Get it... for $2 if you like Sci-Fi and are a fan of FTL or any games like it (heck if your just a star-trek fan) this is totally for you. I don't see how anyone can go wrong with this unless you hate micromanagement.
0783231032|4|Since 1941 is one of my all-time favorite movies,it was with great anticipation that I purchased the DVD.  The supplemental material is exhaustive and fascinating, well worth the price of the DVD alone, but I  was extremely disappointed in the sound and picture quality.   Having seen  1941 in it's previous incarnations on VHS and laserdisc, I was eagerly  looking forward to seeing how it looked on DVD.  While the picture quality  is somewhat improved over the laserdisc (slightly sharper picture and  brighter colors) the overall look of the film is still hazy and washed-out  (although, having viewed the 'making of' documentary, I discovered that  Spielberg and his cinematographer may have intentionally been going for  that look, since they used a lot of smoke throughout filming, to give it a  feeling of having stepped back in time to another era.)   As for the sound  quality, this is where I was most disappointed.  The laserdisc was THX  certified, and the sound effects and music score had a nice, expansive  quality to them to which the DVD cannot hold a candle.  As for the movie  itself, what can I say that hasn't already been beaten into the ground over  the past 21 years?   I agree that the movie really isn't that funny.  What  I enjoy so much about this movie, and I think most people who like this  movie will agree with me, is how brilliantly crafted the movie is.   Everything---the sets, the costumes, the special effects, the editing, the  score---is first-rate.  The film is consistently dazzling to look at.  And  to see most of Los Angeles get demolished in such a spectacular way---well,  call me crazy, but I get a vicarious thrill out of it it all.  Best scenes:   the dogfight over Hollywood Blvd.; the jitterbug contest that turns into a  riot; Lorraine Gary staring in helpless disbelief as husband Ned Beatty  destroys their home with an anti-aircraft gun; Treat Williams and Wendi Jo  Sperber in a runaway motorcycle side-car; the list goes on and on.   The  disc rates five stars for content, but I'm knocking it down to four stars  due to the poor sound/picture quality.
B00IG2DOKM|5|This game is so detailed and complex. I love how you have to feed and population and collect materials from trains.
B00BHHIWQO|4|I bought the game because it was a good distraction for my boyfriend's nieces and nephew.....Then eventually once they left the game became very interesting to myself and I play it every once in a while!
B00FGEAGRM|3|It's ok
B00FAX6XQC|4|This is a very good game. not to hard and not to easy. very good time waster. and i like that it don't  take forever  to refill your energy to play. the biggest issue I'm having is that it keeps freezing on me so it gets frustrating.  fix this then it will be a 5 star app. ~kindle fire~
031606792X|2|Even though I don't really like the writing in the Twilight saga, I do like the story.  It is addicting.  Reading it makes you sigh in frustration and wish it were written with a little more skill.      Breaking Dawn was the worse of the lot.  Bella getting pregnant the very first time might seem a bit overdone (as in another review), but it does happen.  Happened to me the first time after the all clear from the doctor after my first baby, and I got pregnant with twins, when my baby was just 3 months old!  So the \\"didn't want to get married, didn't want kids\\" girl getting knocked up with a honeymoon baby I can believe.  I can also understand her sudden desire to be a mother, thinking about having a child and finding out you're having one are two different things. But if his sperm was venomous and produced a half breed child, why didn't it turn Bella right then?      And then we go into her horribly uncomfortable and dangerous pregnancy.  She's so perfect she doesn't complain or cry, but continues to worry about everyone else.  What a sweet martyr.  More realistic would have Bella crying and complaing at least a little, what pregnant woman doesn't at some point?      And then there is the baby.  Never has there been such a perfect and beautiful child.  She does everything right, sleeps through the night, blah, blah, blah.  Let's see some flaws, some tantrums, some whining.  Even though she's a half breed that has accelrated growth and all that, make her seem a little real.      And Bella, she is the perfect vampire, the most beautiful, graceful, gentle, talented, and controlled there ever was.      I would have enjoyed this more, if the characters had some flaws, if everything wasn't perfect and lovely.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is so addicting that I waste all my battery life playing it. You need to buy this game.
B000ID37RM|5|Outstanding performances of an iconic American novel! Perfect in black and white. Missed a few key scenes in the book.
B00W6XM002|5|Love this game.
B00E8KLWB4|3|Entertaining game. I enjoy the way it's set up. It challenging without being overly so but still fun
B00DJFIMW6|5|It is a great game but it freezes a lot, other than that I like this game. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B001KVZ6HK|5|Please dear God, do not overanalyze the movie.  You know its good.  Just buy it if you find it for the right price.
B00005JKCF|5|Spider-Man is by far the best super-hero movie to be released in quite a while, the last truly good one being the ORIGINAL Batman, starring Michael Keaton.  Just as Keaton did in Batman, Tobey Maguire brings a refreshingly human aspect to his character.  Yes, he is Spider-Man, but he is also Peter Parker, your average, every-day teen, and he faces the same problems that real teenagers do.  And while Maguire brings emotion to the role, the movie would be nothing without the spectacular performances of Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe.  Dunst, as Mary Jane, augments the emotional side of Maguire's Parker.  Dafoe gives a truly evil aspect to the Green Goblin that not many actors could pull off and still make it convincing.  All in all; Spider-Man is a good movie with a great story behind it, and it has enough action to keep even the most difficult-to-please viewer happy.
B004ZGI1V0|4|Love Liam..Truly did justice for his role...Full of suspence and action without being too visually vicious.  Great happy ending too.
B001GQ2TGA|4|ok
B00B19DW0E|1|The worst plot (oh, there might have been one....), worst acting (and that's saying that there might have been a microsecond of acting) , I almost retched but I fell asleep first.
B002BWP49M|5|gooood  thanks
B000KIPT30|1|The sound is not clear.
B001TOD92C|5|I'm very happy with my purchase, the DVD, the wrestler. It plays well, with no problems. I highly recomend purchasing any items here.
B006MW3V6U|5|From the costumes to the characters to the history to the plot I l cannot wait to watch Season 3!
B0000060NA|5|I just bought this CD a few weeks ago.  It sounds like it was recorded then too.  This music is fresh and alive.  Music to make your spirit sing too -- Songs in The Key Of Life indeed.
0977326403|5|I used this book for a class I was teaching and really enjoyed how he presented the materials and the issues he addressed regarding complacency within the Non-Profit world.  My students also said they valued having this book in their professional library.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This is fun.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love this app so much that I could die and stay dead it's so awesome and everything cost money but if you win a free prize it doesn't cost money
B00B7Y0206|5|Works grt on my tablets n with my TV devices to view n I luv it...highly recommend it n it's a grt appl
B002PA8Q1S|2|I heard good things about it randomly on the internet so decided to give it a watch.<br /><br />The way the main character acts is very.. interesting to say the least. I recently finished watching movies with the Hannibal Lector character who is also psycho. That character in that movie was great and spooky. This character is extremely random and constantly energetic. It's actually kind of boring for me to see someone so jumpy that is psycho because it almost makes the mood seem happy even though it should feel somewhat suspenseful.. It's not eerie at all.. not scary in the slightest. It does make you want to finish it to see what the hell is going on, but in the end, nothing is answered. It's so open and unsatisfying that it's just.. sad realizing that I watched the whole thing.
B00DP8XSQ2|5|Such an awesome app!  My friends and family all are amazed when they see this app.<br />Guess you don't need to be a space geek to enjoy it.
B0087IT8FK|5|This true story is so amazing.  I enjoyed the movie in every way...great humor, great acting, wonderful music and an all-around excellent story.  It's so neat to know it's true, although as always in films, there is some fictionalization to add to the drama.  (Of course, it would be far better if no one had to be a quadriplegic in the first place, but so neat both men found such friendship).
B004DI7HZ6|3|I can't believe I'm actually writing a review for another vampire love story. This is a genre that I swore I wasn't going to get sucked into; I blame Stacy. That being said, I really enjoyed the beginning of the story, but the middle of the book started to unravel. The main problem is the book should have been about 100 pages shorter. Then we could have skipped some of the extremely painful conversations and arguments. Why don't the editors of these novels catch that? The book had lots of references to classic art, literature, and great figures from history, which helped me feel like I wasn't just mindlessly reading another novel about vampires.<br /><br />I didn't plan on reading the sequel, but the book redeemed itself in the last 30 pages, and now I'm intrigued again with where the story is headed. Many have compared this novel to Twilight, and I guess in some ways it is, but there are enough differences that the novel can secure it's own place.<br /><br />This is not a novel for your YA reader. There are some adult scenes; nothing too horrible, but they were enough to make me skim through them very quickly.
B0061PEAUY|5|One of her best books yet.  Up to the suspense of her early books.  Good flow to the characters and plot.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and didn't want to put it down to find out what would happen next.
0670022411|5|A Discovery of Witches combines the darkness of the early Vampire Chronicles and the spellbinding storytelling of Anne Rice's witch stories with the mystery, pace and suspense of The Da Vinci Code while throwing in a measure of magical mysticism from JK Rowling. With the foreshadowing of inter-species warfare and unholy alliances, there's a bit of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight mixed in too. All this and it's grounded in a fascinating historical context and set against stunningly alive places. The characters will pull you in as the novel weaves its spell and keep you in its grip from the first chapter to long after you read the last page; it will leave you yearning for the immediate satisfaction of book two and book three.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|This game is great I'm just so happy that it's on here so I don't need to bother getting it on the pc or xbox
B001UV4XHY|5|Deathly Hallows more than blew me way...Rupert Grint and Emma Watson completely stole the show-their chemistry with each other as the bickering, falling completely in love with each other Ron and Hermione was funny, sweet, and at one time sad to watch (because you see how much Ron and Hermione love each other but are afraid to show it yet). Their performances really blew me away-watch Emma's performance when Ron gets splinched or her torture scene; watch Rupert's performance when he is all jealous of Harry and Hermione or his \\"speech\\". But the best is when Ron returns and Hermione is not exactly \\"welcoming back with open arms\\" ;) Their relationship was just fun to watch throughout the entire film and will be even more incredible to watch in part 2 as their relationship evolves further :) As for Dan Radcliffe-his highlighted moment was def 7 Potters!!! He was AMAZING there. Dan also does a great job of showing the emotional rollercoaster he is feeling about putting his best friends' lives in danger. As for the movie itself-the scenery was breathtaking, the writing incredible (*very true to the book), the acting superb-the trio, the older adult actors. I saw DH 8 times and would pay to see it another 8 times. I even have friends who dont see movies over again and they have even seen it more than once now! Buy DH!! Wont be disappointed. Also, Part 2 is only months away!!!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5|My 2 1/2 year old grandson absolutely LOVED watching this. I have to admit that I also liked it very much.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I heard a lot of things going into reading this book; some true some not. I never get this into books, but TFIOS was one that I would read over and over.
B007FG9LIE|4|I read the trilogy in a few days.  Very suspenseful and a page turner.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Many twists and turns I can't wait for the next season.
B00B4FU6KE|5|Very different. Couldn't put it down!
B007PT3QOQ|3|Game is fun but they are asking for too much access. They're asking for access to credit card information, contacts, etc. And they also plan on giving the information to third parties! Not acceptable!
B00NQKWAIQ|5|This was worth the wait. Great job!
B008T4HHWS|1|there was only 15 mins left in the movie and it jsut shut off. tired several times and it shut off . i have seen this movie several times and could not see the best part of the movie.  I should get a refund.
B0019CSXAM|5|love it!
B004HW7JH4|5|Great series to watch.
B0000509C3|4|Children of the Corn, I shall freely admit, will not win any oscars.<br />But like all Grade-B films, it is not meant to.  It is designed for people who like to sit back, munch on chicken wings, and enjoy themselves.<br />With that in mind, I openly admit liking the movie.  Yes, its missing footage should be added back in, and yes, its &quot;climatic&quot; confrontation scene involves one of the most corniest (get it, corniest?  Corny?  Children of the Corn?  I gotta million of 'em!) speeches imaginable, but who cares.<br />It's fun!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5|What a compelling story. You can not wait till the next free time you get continue connecting with all the characters. No more Lizbeth story...sadness there with the death of the author. But don't let that from keeping you from reading the entire trilogy. Without a doubt one of my favorites.
B007J4T2G8|5|great book
B00EOARZ4G|4|I really like the Jack Ryan character and the development of the plot.  It seemed so current with the unrest in the Ukraine.  Always enjoy reading about places I have visited. The skipping back and forth in time can be a little confusing at times, keeping Jack Ryan Jr and his father's previous life before becoming president straight.
B0087GJ8KM|3|Interesting read. Thought Drive was a bit better, similar kind of book. Found a few really good ideas that I made note of. Went on a bit about convincing us that most of us were in sales. I'm sure that is true, didn't really need hard data to convince me. Stories of the (last) Fuller Brush salesman quite touching.
B005S9EJ14|3|I lobed the local and the actors...story was a little weak...except, it is building for other episodes.
B0084670FU|5|I love the way this movie showed that one incident can connect and affect so many other people and most of the time we do not even know anything about the other connections and never will
B00EGMQIJ0|4|An intriguing story with some unusual twists.  The characters are developed nicely and they take some unexpected turns.  Are we heading this way in the future?
B000OZ0NXA|2|I saw the movie and thought I would like the books. I was wrong. Some parts were disgusting and unnecessary. Others were boring and simple. I'll stick with John Sandford and Michael Connelly.
B009NNMB70|5|excelente
B001NLKWLW|3|I'm not crazy about books that keep &#34;flashing&#34; back and forth.  There were a lot of characters to keep track of throughout the years..  It did come together in the end, but by then I felt I lost it.<br /><br />It was a good book for our Book club and led to much discussion.
B00BEK6Z7M|5|Very riveting, it holds your interest to the last page with no letup. and the twists at the end you will not see coming.
0312305060|4|The Hours is a novel about three women whose lives share a common thread. That thread is the novel Mrs. Dalloway. One women is Virginia Woolf, the author of Mrs. Dalloway. Her story seems very loosely based (with much literary license) on the facts of Virginia Woolf's life. Then there is Clarissa Vaughan, a modern version of Mrs. Dalloway, who is nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by a friend of hers at a young age. Like the Woolf character of Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa Vaughan is also preparing to give a party. The third woman is Mrs. Brown, who is coping with her life as best she can, as she reads the novel, Mrs. Dalloway in her spare and stolen moments. This is a story that seems to dance between these three women, with the novel as the dance partner they all share at different moments. I read this two years ago and totally disliked it. This time I read Mrs. Dalloway first (although I feel that a novel should preferably stand on it's own feet)to try to gain an understanding of the style and meaning of this connecting link. I really gained a new appreciation for this novel and the gentle intertwining of the lives of these three women that Michael Cunningham has crafted in the intricate style of Virginia Woolf's writings. The delicate link between these women is more than just depression and a novel named Mrs. Dalloway. This is a novel crafted of intricate layers that, in the final chapters, gently unwrap themselves to reveal the real person that intimately joins these three women together.

B000B5MI3Q|5|Classic design and beautiful watch. Resistant robust and lovely. It demands constant maintenance hence that is analog. At times, it needs time adjustment too. But all and all it is a great piece.
B003FSTN5C|1|There were scratches on the first and fifth disk. The scratches were so deep they could not be played.
B00164EAC8|5|What's with all the bad reviews?  I would have seen it in its theatrical run if not for all the tepid reviews by the \\"professionals\\".  Saw it first on VHS, then DVD (which I bought).  The fakes in the Japanese movies, well, let's just say, not my cup of tea.  Roland Emmerich does nice work and this one is real fun, complete with a dynamite sound track!  Oh well, to each his own, I have pre-ordered by BD copy, and look forward to more fun!
B000KKPN5C|5|I've always avoided using a flash on my digital cameras because the built-in flashes were so tiny that they were virtually useless and the shoe-mounted flashes were  heavy and bulky to pack around. I was always uncomfortable mounting them on my camera's hot shoe  because I felt as if they put a lot of strain on the shoe. I recently bought a Nikon D90 and wanted to take indoor photos of my grandkids. I looked around and found the Nikon SB-400. I was hesitant to buy it because it was spendy and I didn't know if I'd use it enough. I'm glad that I did and am finding that I now use a flash quite frequently.    This unit is small and streamlined and it doesn't feel as if it's going to rip the hot shoe off the camera. It has an amazing amount of power for such a small unit and battery life is excellent. It's extremely easy to use with the D90 - take it out of its pouch, mount it, and turn it on. The D90's TTL metering system does the rest. If you want to modify the output of the flash just use the D90's built-in flash exposure compensation adjustment.    I also purchased the Flip-it! 400 bounce card produced by Demb Flash Products. This small and compact bounce card is designed to work well with the SB-400. It mounts and can be removed easily with an elastic strap that has a  Velcro tab. It looks very small but it works great.

B00B2V66VS|5|Sometimes the game might glitch and you'll fall into a gap that you jumped over. But it is definitely five star worthy.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|Flappy wings (definitely not flappy bird...)  is fun, addicting, and a good challenge. Why anyone would create a game like this beats me, but it sure is a good time waster.
B008Y2X78S|5|Great show.
B00F35B8F8|5|This was a fresh take on a classic. They did Gene Roddenberry justice. I may just have to seek out the previous movie and give it a try.
B0013K1ALE|5|Whether you're a Led-Head like me or just a casual Zeppelin fan, this is mandatory viewing material.  It's undoubtedly one of the finest guitar performances ever caught on film.  Ever.  The things Jimmy pulls off are amazing.  With this DVD you get to see Led Zeppelin all at the height of their creativity, talent and ability.  I was a little surprised when I first realized that the newly included songs that were left off the original motion picture were placed on a separate disk and not inserted into their respective places in the concert film.  But then I read that due to legal reasons, they weren't allowed to alter the original format of the film...only remaster the sound and images, but not mess around with the order of songs.  So they had to put those other songs from the NY concerts on a separate disk.  No biggie, at least you now have them all.  The Ocean, Celebration Day and others!  Some cool extras that I hadn't seen before.             Some people who don't understand Led Zeppelin have complained that the live versions don't sound like the studio versions.  However, Led never tried to reproduce that sound.  They played these songs differently every night.  Another complaint is that some say Zep live is self-indulgent.  It's not.  Per Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin live allows for all four members to take their turn in \\"steering the ship.\\"  In this manner, it's actually very generous to the other members and not selfish. What else can be said that hasn't already been said by thousands (millions?) of other Zep fans.  This concert is tremendous and the level of musicianship is awe-inspiring.  And why wouldn't you want to see Jimmy at his height, playing his double-neck Gibson plus his famous Les Pauls!  If you like rock music, you've got to have it.
B00BD99JMW|1|Worse ending to a series ever!  I am so disappointed with the author and her betrayal towards her readers! I will never read a book written by her again. She changed the characters and ruined an incredible plot.  I wish I had not read the final book.  It was deeply depressing and not well written.  The story had too many deaths and too many unanswered issues.  It is as if she rushed to get the final book published without concern for her readers.  Very disappointing!
B004H4XDBI|3|Wasn't as good as If I Stay but I still enjoyed it
B002XWXPC8|5|A good laugh and enjoyable entertainment to be had.  Just a good relaxing comedy for a night of unwinding and settle down.

0307408868|3|On July 7, 2002, I read Diana Preston's book on the sinking of the Lusitania and felt it was probably the definitive book on that event, so i  did not intend to read this book, especially since I felt Larson's Isaac's Storm (read 9 Dec 1998) and his book The Devil in the White City (read 2 Aug 2004) constructed inferiorly, with much extraneous matter having little to do with the subject.  But when a book club I attend picked it I had to read it.  I found it really does insert much material only tangentily related to the subject or mere trivia, but the chapters on the actual sinking I found were riveting and emotion-packed.  So the book was better than I expected, . But don't expect much insight in regard to the political or diplomatic significance of the event.
B000059XUP|1|The first Crow was an excellent film....and it's so tragic how the entire plot of the movie circles around death and in the process of making it Brandon Lee's life came to an end....he in the process though made one of the best movies i've ever seen. The best action movie ever, unquestionably......the plot was great, the acting was brilliant, the script had meaning, heart, soul........there is not one bad word you can say about the first Crow. Rest In Peace Brandon.<br />As far as Crow 2: City Of Angels<br />GRRRRR!!!!!! BAD BAD BAD BAD SHAMEFUL BAD<br />This movie is terrible. Brandon has been replaced with a fat balding english man hopping around yelling stupid stuff to the extent of &quot;I'm going to get you&quot;...the witty repartee has been replaced with terrible drivel. Iggy Pop isn't even a threatening villain...but maybe it's because Iggy Pop is so cool.<br />Even Iggy Pop and The Deftones couldn't save this one. Dont waste your money.....go buy The Crow and marvel at it's greatness.
B003VR5PPY|5|All I have to say is that this is one of my favorite games for the DS of all time. Here are some things to note:    1. The heart of this game lies in the story, not the gameplay.    2. If you enjoyed Battle Royale, you'll LOVE this.    3. The gameplay is very similar to the Phoenix Wright games.    4. The story is really really good!
B00CWY76CC|5|Fun and challenging. Make you really think. If you love puzzles than I would really recommend this app for you.
B0066WJLU6|5|it works very well, the light is bright enough to write by. there is a color change option. I haven't experienced any problems with this product.
B007PZADLO|5|Train continues to amaze me.  The music they are making today, is music I love as much as their stuff from 15 years ago.  That's rare.  The vinyl pressing is good, and as usual, lends depth to the listening experience not found in other media.

So far very pleased with this charger.
B0089LOG02|5|one of the best books I've ever read and I read a lot!  I have recommended it to all of my friends.
B009WUAK2M|5|If you love the cheezy action flicks of the 1980's then you've alreayd seen the Expendables 2 and loved it. If you havn't seen it yet, give it a chance. It's bad guys are downright evil. The good guys are downright awesome and the dialogue is as cheeze as can be. Add on good production values and a great widescreen presentation and it's way better than searching for that old Delta Force VHS in the back of your crawlspace!
B008KNUKVI|5|I first saw this group on \\"The Sing Off\\" and was blown away that five people could produce such a fantastic sound. The rhythm and bass, the tight vocals, the arrangements--the entire package is unbelievable. I agree with another reviewer that the only problem is that once you listen to their music you want to play it over and over and you can't get it out of your head! No doubt this group is destined for great things.
B00E8KLWB4|4|So far I like it.  Need to learn how to navigate through the game and make some friends.  Wish the energy would add up faster.

006135323X|4|As human beings, we want to see ourselves as rational creatures, possessed of an intelligence that trumps our emotional impulses. Au contraire, asserts Dan Ariely, the Alfred P. Sloan, Professor of Behavioral Economics at MIT. Not only are we irrational, he says, but predictably so. More often than not, our highly touted reason is trumped by passion and rationalization. We make the same foolish mistakes over and over again.    Ariely offers data from the emerging field of behavioral economics, which studies judgment and decision-making. Amassing data from numerous empirical tests, this academic discipline investigates what it is about life that motivates people and causes us to think and behave as we do.    Written in a highly accessible style, Predictably irrational possesses more scientific substance than most pop psychology books. Ariely delivers intriguing insights into phenomena such as the placebo effect, and he peppers the pages with arresting and amusing anecdotes.    Predictably Irrational is both instructive and fun to read.
B004J4WNL2|5|As a creative development advisor who works with profoundly original and highly introverted artists, writers, directors and innovators, and as born introvert, I was delighted to come across, Quiet, Susan Cain's excellent book.  As a self-professed introvert, Cain explores the lives, challenges and contributions of introverts living in an extroverted society with candor and color, wisely blending research findings, personal anecdotes, and in the latter part of the book micro-scenarios that explore problems and solutions with which introverts and their extroverted partners must contend.  Her even tone, careful explication of research findings, and her analysis of the inner world and expressive challenges faced by introverts, mirror her illustrations of the means by which introverts can speak up with confidence and power in negotiations, sales situations and public fora.  In this important sense, she demonstrates subtly, as she puts it, \\"The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking\\"<br /><br />As the author of [[ASIN:B008MQANA6 Intentional Practice & The Art of Finding Natural Audience: A Framework for Artists and Professionals (Intentional Practice in the Arts and the Professions)]], a short book  that helps introverted artists and professionals negotiate the waters between the Scylla of dysfunctional diffidence and the Charybdis of shameless self-promotion, I much appreciated the pitch and tone of Cain's discussion of how introverts can find ways to express their ideas in public, and build the relationships they need in order to thrive in their work.  Her thoughts on these matters and the basic framework she provides offer sensible means by which introverts can engage the world without burning out.<br /><br />The value of Cain's simple and practical advice cannot be overestimated.  Introverts struggle mightily with identity issues, and a capable author who validates their struggle, and encourages them neither to hide, nor to ape extrovert values, but totake practical steps to meet the world in a way that is sensible and rewarding to them, is terribly important.  That said, the author does not acknowledge or explore the profound pain and difficulty that comes with the choice to venture out, to be seen, and to be heard, nor does she speak to the means by which introverts can come to grips with and surmount the challenges of meeting the tasks she has set for them.  I see this less as a defect of the book and more as an opportunity to open a dialogue about the means by which introverts can confidently come to engage, enlighten and enjoy those around them.  Cain beautifully illustrates what it is like for a gifted introvert to arrive at this place with her closing story about her grandfather, the Rabbi in Brooklyn, and her family life gathering to read together.  In many ways, I wish the she had begun the book with this warm and loving tale.  Well done and well worth reading.

B004QKNXIQ|4|This movie was wholesome, funny, and enjoyable.  Even though one scene had digital pixelation for a couple seconds, the rest of the movie played well.
B008XKSW7M|4|Watching this movie brought back memories of trying to get pregnant, being pregnant, bringing the baby home, and dealing with a husband who was reluctant to be a father. It definitely hit a good balanced between comedy and reality. A surprising number of laugh-out-loud moments. I was worried that it would be a bit too serious.

B00JSCZ34Y|5|This album is fantastic. The band creates lush and vibrant soundscapes encompassing a wide range of musical styles - and Chris Robinson's songwriting skills and singing voice are aging like fine wine - it gets better and better with time.
B00006RAKP|1|Elton John comes out with a new greatest hits CD every other year it seems but the song Funeral for a Friend never makes it on the CD. Until it does the greatest hits CD's from Elton John will always be considered partial greatest hits to me.<br />Sorry you old Queen but that's the way it is.

B000002AVF|4|This was my first Mariah Carey album, I bought it because I couldn't get enough of &quot;Fanstasy&quot; the only upbeat track of the album, that introduce us to the mind of someone who's love hasn't come true, great beats!, great lyrics!, the rest of the album is well produced, but is a little to slow, it should have include at least one more upbeat song, cuz the daydream inturlude it's just wrong!, the best tracks for my taste are:<BR>&quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; a little corny but it's okay, &quot;Long Ago&quot; great meaning and beat, this song was the predecessor of Butterfly's tracks, &quot;Underneath The Stars&quot; so sweet, &quot;Forever&quot;, my second favorite, timeless love lyrics, sound like a 50's song, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; I hated this song so much back in the day, but now I learned to rejoice the lyrics and the meaning of it. The Other songs are too much alike(When I Saw You, I Am Free, Melt Away), I feel like their are filler, except for &quot;Looking In&quot; wich I consider a teaser, to taste a different Mariah.  This album deserves the 4 stars because of the killer tracks that are include here and for the classic status of the album selling over 10 million copies.  But to tell you the truth, in the middle of the album you will be SLEEPING!, so if you want to listen to Forever or Long Ago skip the filler tracks!
B0000004V2|5|The Stone Roses.  It's difficult to know where to start.  If you've listened to Garage Flowers and Second Coming, you'll appreciate that the band had talent and possibly the charisma that is essential for true  greatness, but you might have concluded: never quite made it.  If you've  listened to The Stone Roses you will think no such thing (unless you're  insane or Bob Geldof). The progression from dodgy goth/rock band to the  greatest band this planet has ever seen started with Sally Cinnamon, but  the Stone Roses  really flexed their muscles with Elephant Stone, the  single released directly before their eponymous debut (which is an extra  track on the US import version). Elephant Stone is a fantastic song, as out  of place in 1988 as Fool's Gold sounded in 1989.  All shimmering guitar,  gorgeous harmonies and those Reni-patented fluid drum beats, the song stuck  out a mile, though not to the record-buying public, since it made not a  dent in the charts. When Made of Stone, a darkly gorgeous Roses classic  (with the best guitar solo this side of Stairway to Heaven), also flopped,  things looked bleak, but by the time She Bangs the Drums broke the band  into the top 40, the Stone Roses bandwagon was rumbling along nicely, the  biggest underground music movement seen in this country for many a year.   The revolution had started, and Oasis, among many, had The Stone Roses to  thank for reintroducing British guitar music to a public that had been  force fed acid house and Jive Bunny.  <br />The album starts with a distant  rumble of thunder, which gradually morphs into feedback and then that  bassline.  By the time Ian Brown's voice enters the fray, the other three  have already entranced you.  A mesmerising opener, which you could be  forgiven for assuming is by far the best track on the album.  Until She  Bangs the Drums kicks in - another irresistible bassline, guitar wizardry  of the highest order, beautiful harmonies - the sun shining on a decade of  gloom.  Waterfall completes an incredible triumvirate of opening tracks, a  Simon and Garfunkel soaked tale of a girl on acid. Thereafter, Don't Stop  (Waterfall backwards) and Bye Bye Badman are the closest the album gets to  fillers, though pretty damn good fillers. Elizabeth My Dear introduces  Sugar Spun Sister, another gorgeous song with the most uplifting chorus  you're likely to hear.  Then Made of Stone, dark, delicious, John Squire at  his peak. Shoot You Down is a good song (faint praise indeed...). This is  the One and I am the Resurrection defy description really, utterly  fantastic, innovative (yet drawing on the best traditions), addictive - you  cannot get bored of them, and indeed the album in its entirety (and I'm not  even going to mention Fools Gold).  This record changed my life, if you  hadn't guessed already, and however little they actually produced compared  to The Beatles, The Stones, whoever, you cannot convince me that for a  single moment in the history of rock music, a band has shone brighter than  The Stone Roses at their glorious peak. This is the proof.
B00BUCXVPI|5|Not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but really enjoyed this movie. Downloaded the book and it's even better! Lots of action and mystery.
B002BSHWUU|5|No mention of the famous HEY JUDE album ?  Has everyone lost it ?  Probably only me.  I was so excited to find this set that I immediately looked for my favorite album but didn't find it.  At the time, I didn't realize all the songs from that album are in this boxed set.  It caught me by surprise because Hey Jude has always been my favorite Beatles album and still is.  Sorry for the incorrect previous posting. 5 stars for sure !
0385341008|5|Not being previously aware of Guernsey, (it is one of the Channel Islands off of Britian) and not knowing it was occupied by the Nazis during the war, this book was a delightful surprise.  Cleverly crafted as letters to reveal the story, it was a perfect light summer read.  It was easy to put down and pick up as each letter is a stand-alone part of the story as a whole.
B005LLX582|5|Thought provoking movie that makes you dig deeper into the recesses of the soul and mind. I consider it a masterpiece.

B000002MTU|5|this is an amazing cd, bought one for my fella 10 years ago and he lent it to someone and never got it back, Eric Clapton does an outstanding job of re-doing all those old blues songs, a must for any blues lover!
B000059R8Y|5|Seems that most people either love this album or hate it, and I have to put myself firmly on the side of the lovers.  Yes, this album is a mixture of styles that Clapton has come out with in the last ten years (and some faithful fans of the &quot;old&quot; Clapton won't like that) but if you loved From the Cradle, and still have Unplugged on your list of best albums, you are going to enjoy Reptile.  Riding with the King was easily the best album of 2000, and this may not be up to those standards, but put this album in, turn it up, and get ready for a great time.  I highly recommend.
0765316978|5|While this is the last of the trilogy that includes \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades,\\" it is not necessary to have read the others to follow and enjoy \\"The Last Colony.\\"<br /><br />Scalzi seamlessly supplies the background as protagonist and narrator John Perry describes the bucolic retirement he and his wife, Jane Sagan, and adopted daughter, Zoe, are about to leave behind.<br /><br />Perry and Sagan are both retired soldiers who gave up their highly modified bodies for ordinary human ones. Or so they believe until the Colonial Union offers them a challenging post establishing up a new planetary colony, Roanoke. New colonies are always a challenge since the heavens are filled with carbon-based species who covet each other's finds.<br /><br />And that is about the only true thing the Colonial Union has told them. Even the planet they're sent to is not the one they prepped for. And Sagan soon realizes she is still very much Special Forces enhanced. And it's not just any rag-tag alien army that's after them. Instead, they are pawns in an interstellar battle of empires.<br /><br />With wry humor and plenty of twists and turns that rely more on mental agility than military might - though there's a sufficiency of battles - Scalzi explores the pitfalls of government duplicity on a grand scale, censorship, ego, xenophobia and more. Never heavy handed, Scalzi provides well-written entertainment that can be enjoyed beyond the boundaries of the genre.
B007J4T2G8|5|I haven't read a book in 15 years...and this one got me hooked. Thrilling, don't want to so reading action! I loved it
B00BEIYN3M|4|Haven't seen a real funny movie since &#34;Office Space&#34;  This movie has some clever, funny and smart dialogues with comical situations that totally appear natural and out-of-this-world at the same time.  Who would ever thought about this?  What an adventure.<br /><br />Great character developments, genius of a movie script, beautifully shot especially the night scenes, the color just appears very pleasing.  I don't recall this movie being talked about when it was in the theatre but it's a joy - Never laughed out loud so hard for a long time.  Definitely a comedy for the whole family - A Family movie.  A family of one, that is  ;)
B002JXK5VU|1|I watched two episodes and was lost.  Since this ran back in 2009 (or so), I must have missed it then, for good reason.  Too many twists and turns with multiple characters involved.
0345451325|4|When I first saw the series of 3 Halo books, I took a pass.  They had all the hallmarks of the chronically bad \\"novelizations\\" of popular movies, especially science fiction movies.  Microsoft even owns the copyright, which seemed like a harbinger of doom.<br /><br />Anyhow, I played my way through Halo 1 and got hooked, so I picked up the three volume set.  While Nylund isn't exactly John Grisham, or even David Weber, the book was a surprisingly good read--the pacing was pretty quick, considering how many years are covered in the book, and I found myself feeling like I understood the characters in the game (particularly the Master Chief and Cortana) better.  The plot is plausible, as far as science fiction stories go, and the characters are pretty well-defined.<br /><br />In fact, it was the departures from the game's storyline that left me a bit puzzled, although the differences are subtle enough that you really can't call them contradictions.  For one thing, it's pretty clear in both games that the Master Chief is the last of the Spartan-II supersoldiers.  That gets fudged more than a bit in this and the subsequent two novels.  Other minor details were annoying but not really hazardous to the book's health.  For example, in the book, Cortana spends time inside the Master Chief's suit, and was intended to go there.  The first game, however, implies pretty strongly that Cortana's never been inside the Chief's \\"head\\" before, and that the transfer of the AI to the Master Chief is an emergency measure only.<br /><br />That said, it's probably too much to expect a novel that's a prequel to a video game to be 100% consistent with the video game's story line (and it's a testament to Bungie, the makers of Halo, that there was so much story line to work with and work around).  If you haven't played the game, you're unlikely to buy this book (or to have read this far in my review, for that matter).  If you do have the game, you'll enjoy this book and the two that follow--just make sure you finish Halo I before you read the second two books.low--just make sure you finish Halo I before you read the second two books.

B000HEWEE4|4|Most of the questions that came to me during a recent screening of THE LAKE HOUSE had nothing to do with the \\"time travel\\" aspect of the movie which I knew going in would be over my head.  But like everyone else, I respond viscerally to any movie that pairs Keanu Reeves with Sandra Bullock.  The two of them should star in all movies, in any year--2004, 2006, or now.  Think of how many films would have been much improved if only Reeves and Bullock had been available to take the title parts.  I'm thinking of MULHOLLAND DR, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, THE ICE AGE, even something like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN could have used Sandra Bullock playing the part Anne Hathaway did and tempting Keanu Reeves with her knowledge of rodeo driving.<br /><br />But my questions were more about, what is with the strange brother of Keanu Reeves, Henry, and his leonine hairline which looks as though hair grows out of his head backwards and gets crimped there?  Where did they find this actor, or the woman who plays Sandra's mother?  For her part, the producers might have been turned down by Marsha Mason so they decided to get the \\"foreign\\" Marsha Mason, with her odd Dutch or Malaysian accent but all of Marsha Mason's botox plumping out her face like a pin cushion.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD.)<br /><br />It made me uncomfortable all the time she was around, even discounting the fact that I believe the mother (played by Willeke van Ammelrooy) made that bus run over Keanu Reeves as she sat with her daughter at Dealey Plaza and realized, when she lifted her gaze and saw Alex Wyler begin to approach, that this was the man who would once and for all take Sandra away from her at last.  Did anyone else get this, or am I just reading into things?  Notice that once Keane and Sandra get together, you never see the mother again.<br /><br />(END OF SPOILERS.)<br /><br />I believe that the movie calls out for a sequel in which Keanu's character, Alex Wyler, and his architect brother, Henry (played by Ebon Moss-Bachrach) would use their newfound time travel powers to go back and save the life of their mother, the woman who broke Christopher Plummer's heart and who condemned her two boys to live lives of meaningless hedonism and avant-garde architecture.

B0088P2A7A|5|I use this app a lot on my computer and was glad to find that it was available for my Kindle Fire.  It works great.
B00G4Q3KOC|5|I had read the book and had a hard time staying with it. The format is more narrative and I found I could not stay focused. So I decided to watch the movie. I was so glad that I did. The movie was great and I do recommend it. I like stories about the past and this one taught me about an aspect of slavery that I did not know about. Very good!
B0064X7FVE|5|I really like this app, especially at work.  I can check the weather and the radar before I go outside.  I work in a basement with no windows.  We literally have to go outside to check the weather.  This makes it much more convenient.
B00D7Z4GQY|4|Confusing to read because the stories went back and forth, etc.  However, it was a fascinating read and what one will do to protect family.
630018403X|5|After this movie many have tried to copy it or make a better film about teen angst and they have failed. This movie is a instant classic and will be continued to be watched for years to come. The lines in this film are  the best. Like does Barry Manilow know you raided his wardrobe? watch this  movie you won't be sorry.
B00275EHJG|5|My two year old doesn't watch tv, but he loves toy story 3 he watches it when he wakes up and goes to bed great movie.
B001W79MB8|5|No big plot. Great animation and fights. The animation is not stuning when it cames to details, but the action scenes are very fluid. You will want to to see the fight scenes several times. Very enjoyable.
B00BESKTMG|2|Bad acting.
B003TSEL7S|5|The moment I read this book, I was like so excited, since I read about Roman Gods. I was like, &#34;OH MY GOD, DID RICK JUST COMBINED GREEK AND ROMAN GODS TOGETHER!?&#34; And he even made them into the same gods, albeit different personalities. HAHA I've been waiting to spaz to someone, anyone about that fact, but nuuu, people around me do not know the concept of books HEHE. Anyway, yes, this is the first time I'm reading the continuation of the Percy Jackson series. And then I realised that Percy Jackson won't be in this book. :( But it's okay, he'll be in the next book  :) In the meantime, there's a new cutie named Jason, and oh boy, he is so damn cute. His past will surprise you though HAHA. And then there's his supposed girlfriend, Piper. Though, I think in the end, she will confirm be his girlfriend. Piper (I'm so dying to tell you which god's daughter she belonged to, but hahaha I shall not spoil it.) is actually quite cool, especially when you realise that she's the kind who doesn't even realise that she's prettyyyy. I prefer her over Annabeth honestly (don't kill me, shippers of Percabeth.) So yeah, OMG I really can't wait to read the next book! I'm sure this series will be as awesome as the original Percy Jackson series, especially once Percy himself is in the story. ;)
067960085X|5|The short novel, Breakfast at Tiffany's is wonderful.  You could not ask for a more interesting character than Holly Golightly.  She is a complete child has little regard for anyone but herself, and runs around New York like some play girl.  You instantly fall in love with the mysteriousness that surrounds her life and the crazy events that pile on top of each other.  From the way she finds cloths in her disheveled apartment to the nameless tabby cat that prowls during her eclectic get-together.  The slow piecing together of Holly to the climatic ending is truly a ride.<br /><br />The three short stores that are included in this version where surprisingly good.  They made me think of Raymond Carver and Richard Yeats.  I think Capote was before both of them so he could very well have been an influence.  A Christmas Memory was one of the best short stories that I have ever read.<br /><br />I have In Cold Blood now on order and am looking forward to reading it.
B00BB8RKH6|5|Love Denzel, great actor, great role for him.
B005JE7XW0|5|Hilarious, creative, smart and thoroughly enjoyable- this movie delivers if you're looking for some comedy in your horror collection. The main characters are flawlessly enjoyable.
B0070NSPCU|5|About as interesting and complex a main character as you can have, within a rich world with rich supporting characters.  Ryan brings to life the cast with simple yet purposeful writing totally engrossing you from beginning to end.
6303014100|5|This is the best civil war movie yet except for the LONG talking scenes. Hey Mr. Maxwell, if you by chance see this I have one suggestion for your upcoming Gods and Generals filming--A lot more ACTION and less talking.  What really stands out to me in the movie are the musical scores that go  along perfectly with the different scenes, especially Pickett's Charge.It  really sets the mood. Great job Mr. Turner/Maxwell.
B0082RHRHC|5|This is truly a classic read. A story of really life but of rare love between two people and well a true ending
B006ID6NDQ|5|Fascinating account of life as a  non-religious Jew dealing with incredibly horrific situations under Hitler's reign. Well-written, always interesting. Learned very sad things.
B00P42WROG|5|Awesome!!
B0063IH60K|5|I love. this. game. I'm addicted. to it love. it so fun u need to get it or are u to chicken.
B00AHSLU2C|5|Great movie for kids and adults.
B00932A4XE|4|Overall it had a phenomenal cast and was very funny.  If you have children or are expecting it's a must watch
B00L9B7IKE|5|Scarey and kept me entranced until the end.  A dark story, reminded me of Gone Girl but a very different story!
B001NLKXK2|5|MY MOM HAS THIS HORRIBLE DISEASE AS DID MY PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER. ITS ON BOTH SIDES OF MY FAMILY SO THIS IS ON MY MIND A LOT. THIS STORY IS VERY TRUE TO LIFE. IT BROUGHT UP A LOT OF EMOTION.
B00FAPF5U0|1|Can't see the rhyme or reason for this game.
0930289234|5|This makes about the 10th time I've been through this series.  It really was an amazing turning point for comics.  I caught it a few years late, but the impact was no less effective.  The shifts between current and flashback, the relationship of the side stories to events in the characters lives  - and particularly the dark, adult subject matter explaining the motivations of the various flawed characters made it so real - a little too real at my first exposure.<br /><br />Although it's not the most clever story in the whole, my favorite character to analyze has always been Dr. Manhattan.  As kids we played superheroes and the inevitable escalation of powers always led to the taunt \\"well, Superguy (or whatever) can do anything\\".  As an adult, Watchmen explored the idea of exactly what could happen to a person that can basically do anything - how it affects his mental shift, values and relationships.  It remains the most intriguing mindplay from the series, at least for me.<br /><br />I don't have to extol the values of the series; they're well documented. This series and the Dark Knight Returns series was what brought my attention back to comic books from my grade school days with Jack Kirby and Stan Lee.
B009XIXVU6|5|A personal look into the lives of Afghans in a way I would never have known or experience. A wonderful and enjoyable book. I highly recommend it.
B0064MGU98|5|I love how the personal story lines are woven through the weekly episodes of legal cases. This cast has chemistry. I love the characters, some I love and some I love to hate.
B00AI3UP54|5|I chose this rate because is a wonderfull edition of this wonderfull movie , and have portuguese subtitles. Recomend this product
B00AEFXEZE|5|Very good.
B00664AM5C|4|Really good to show how things get spread.
B006PHD0RW|5|Had a problem at first, then the dev helped me out and now things are running smoothly.  Great game. I love it.
B00H6T36QS|4|This is a marvelous piece of writing. The world Abercrombie has created is captivating and pulls one in. The book practically reads itself as one struggles to put it down. Well worth the read
0679422714|5|I was first introduced to the life of Mao by Edgar Snow's book 'Red Star Over China'  I was greatly impressed with Mao.  Then came the 1960's with the Cultural Revolution.  I could not believe some of the crazy things initiated by Mao.  This has been perplexing me ever since.  This book is certainly a rude awakening for me.  I can see that Snow's book was one-sided and highly biased.  Here is finally a book written by a Chinese (I mean Chang) who grew up in China, lived through those turbulent times and did a fair amount of research in producing this book. While no one can prove the correctness and authenticities of all instances mentioned in this book, it certainly has been able to explain a lot of things that happened.  Snow was genuine but he spent only a short time in Yenan and interviewed only Mao and Mao's men. Other books such as those by Ross Terill and Jerome Chen were far less detailed and authentic.  I highly recommend this book
B004SJ3BCI|5|Never had played this before but love it.  Would recommend this for anyone with some idle time looking for a good game.
B00AMBK0X4|3|A few laughs, emphisis on few.  Sam Jones was funny, the bear had a few te he's here and there, but that was about it.
B0083ZRAJS|5|I checked this book out as I was curious. I ended up enjoying it more than I would enjoy watching the movie. A good read for anyone.
1250012570|4|By now, you've probably read about Eleanor & Park or at least heard about the book. It's made waves all across the blogosphere... So my friend and I decided to read this one together, and I decided I would share my email to her with you all because... hell, maybe you're still curious or debating whether to read this one. But debate no more: read it! Love it! Enjoy :).<br /><br />\\"That book.<br /><br />This book.<br /><br />Now I know why everyone was saying it broke their hearts.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />I know you don't like spoilers, so I'm really hoping you're only reading this if you've finished...<br /><br />...but the plot twist?<br /><br />Wow. So unexpected. And so powerful. And so *insert spoiler here*<br /><br />Okay, so originally I thought, hmm, this book feels a bit long. I'm not overly fond of the high school narrative and while I liked that Park / Eleanor had complicated school dynamics and that they didn't really like each other at the start - which lent a lot to the realism - I thought the book was slow. But it didn't matter that it was slow, because the writing, while simplistic, is so beautiful. I love that she switched from their perspectives, even for small lines to cement whether Eleanor / Park did X and X, falling in line with our expectation. And I counted. 15 pages have been ear-marked. So many quotes. So many beautiful descriptions. You know what it really reminds me of? Gayle Forman's work, which makes sense because she blurbed the front. But there's this underlying truth in the narrative that I've felt mostly with Forman's work. John Green has a bit of that, but his seems much more explicit with all the metaphors he throws around.<br /><br />Such a simple premise but so well executed.<br /><br />I loved that both of their families had both happy and terrible moments, because then it was less of type-casting, you know? Although I am a bit undecided as to how I feel on some of the characters... Some stereotypes were explored but disowned(i.e. cultural portrayal of Asian men as asexual) while others were just kind of left there (i.e. Eleanor's friends; my friends would probably not be pleased with DeNice and Beebi's portrayals).<br /><br />On a different but related note, I loved that Eleanor is big. That sounds strange to say, but I've noticed that a lot of the girls with larger bodies either seem to be useless sidekick or a bully. It's a prevalent stereotype in middle-grade fiction, for sure. Percy Jackson -> Clarice. In Bridge to Terabithia, I forgot what her name was... Janice? Those two examples come immediately to mind, but there's a lot more... And anyway, I think that being slim is considered a part of the \\"default.\\" (White, Christian protag. unless otherwise specified.) And I think that having someone like Eleanor contributes to diversity in a different way than is usually discussed.<br /><br />I also don't usually love full-out descriptions of the characters, but I loved them here... They were so Eleanor, so Park. And they were so integral to that feeling. As John Green wrote, what it's like to be young and in love. And so without the usual cynicism. There is some cynicism, but mostly there is hope. And goodness.<br /><br />This book.<br /><br />Okay, I will stop now.\\"
B007IXWKUK|5|Can't to read book 3.  I love watching the relationship evolve.  Fewer shades of Mr. Grey, while Mrs. Grey grows some of her own.
B00KFDO44A|5|Beautiful album. Exceeded my expectations. Perfect for a sad night inside with hot cocoa and a notepad. Quality of the LP was great, perfectly brand new.
B006HL9G10|5|I really enjoyed the free version  of this app, so I stepped up to the paid version, and it is even better. Well designed, good sounds, and never a problem.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|It is a lot of fun but after a person finishes a task , they can no longer get special items from harvesting to help friends out.
B00B89WXYS|4|But I'm really enjoying the rest of the CD.  That doesn't happen very often for me.  This album is of consistent quality, though.  Preacher is a great track.  Probably my second favorite.
B00VRYCGLO|3|Timed games are almost impossible.
B007N8RULO|4|Addictive!!
B000SW2F80|5|It's a great horror /comedy from a. Great writer steven king. The thoughts of this man is something most people have dreamed about or had in thought I know as a child, I grew up this way with stories or Friday night fright night. I want to thank him for his great works!!!! Classic!!!!
B007SZ0E1K|5|Some of my software and even task manager showed 2 cores in use. With some research I found that EASY BCD allowed you to force Windows 7 to change from 2 to 4 cores. The difference was night and day. Like others this was added after I installed Windows 7 Home Premium, and a Z77 Motherboard. I went from a 3D Mark 11 Benchmark of about 7,000+ to 9,700+. and boosted games FRAPS 30 to 40%.<br />  Can you overclock this thing? Hell ya! 4.5 or higher is very possible
1439102813|5|Still Alice is a book that everyone should read. Alice comes across as so real, so poignant, in a condition that could impact anyone. This possibility really hits home upon reading this book. It will tenderize your heart toward those experiencing dementia of their own or of their loved ones.
B004MC8CA2|5|The amount of effort that has gone into building this app shows why it is a top pick among all of the Bible apps.  Take some time to scroll through the numerous translations, study tools, and reading plans. This is a true blessing for the sons and daughters of God. We have his word right here at our fingertips at any time of the day!
B00KMX5V8G|5|Love, love, love this game!
B0093AV8IQ|5|great movie… I remember going to the cinema many moons  ago to see this movie an how it impressed me. When the recent release was shown, the trailers didn't do well for me so I was prompt to search this original… very happy to have found it.
0439813786|5|This is an unusual and delightful book. Ostensibly for children, I enjoyed it more than my daughter! The magic is not so much the tale as how it is told. The book alternates between passages of text and pictures that run like a film's storyboard. The result is the closest I have ever seen a book come to simulating multimedia.<br /><br />It is worth noting that I come to the book having seen the film. As with all book/film scenarios, there are differences between the two. I found the film warmer than the book and, surprisingly, the film filled out the characters a lot more than the book.<br /><br />Why read this? Because it is magical.  It also makes superb bedtime reading with the children due to the pictures and the simple, straight language.
1250038820|5|My daughter and I both read this book and loved it!
B004SJ3BCI|5|awesome but it is a little hard for beginners.  the more hard levels take millions of tries but if you persevere through it is fun.
B00ESY827C|5|I had no interest in watching this movie (I thought it was about the mob, like the Godfather, a movie theme I hate), until I caught it in HBO. I have to say it completely engaged me, the tragic love story is compelling, the cinematography is superb, the acting (specially from DiCaprio and Mulligan) moves you. I liked it so much I have watched it four times this past week. I haven't read the novel or seen the original movie, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I loved this remake.
B003U0AHBO|5|I almost passed on watching this movie as I've never been all that interested in the Robin Hood story, which has become more or less of a parody.  I've never thought of this story as historical or epic, this is probably due to how it's been portrayed by Hollywood.<br /><br />I decided to give this a chance because of Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott.  The two of them have been involved in more movies that I've found to me outstanding than I can think of right now.<br /><br />From the start I was drawn into the story, and struck by the historical and political aspects of this film.  All the care and little details that went into making this film really made the viewer connect with it, in its historical context.<br /><br />I had no idea what the Robin Hood story was really all about, but have a greater sense of that now, and have been reading up on 12th century English history as a result.<br /><br />It's about time a film like this was made about Robin Hood, and the real story presented.<br /><br />Well done!
B00FEMJF6O|2|Stupendous game, but the money needed for land in the end and teasing with unopened lands has been a total let down. A crushing and bitter end ha (it just stops with obviously much more to the story.)
B00I6JOBTI|5|Great for kids and adults. Seen it a dozen times and I still laugh.
B0021L8V1Q|5|Director Jon Favreau continues to excel with Marvel's new superhero franchise in the exciting blockbuster sequel \\"Iron Man 2\\". With the world now aware of his secret, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is determined to ensure that his Iron Man technology doesn't fall into the wrong hands, despite the countless pressures from the US government to turn over his technology for military application. If knowing that his personal arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body wasn't bad enough, Stark must also deal with the vengeful scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and the greedy industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). \\"Iron Man 2\\" delivers everything that one would expect for a big Summer blockbuster sequel. Though it does fall short of the original, many of the key elements are still present in the sequel, and it definitely offers a very good dose of exciting action and impressive special effects. Robert Downey Jr. continues to dominate the role of Tony Stark. The cast also includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man 2\\" is one of this year's biggest movies, and Paramount certainly delivers a standout fully-loaded 3-disc presentation that ranks as one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year. The blockbuster sequel is presented in a 2.35:1 HD format. The picture quality is excellent and its DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio sound is certainly amazing. Among special features, it includes a commentary track by director Jon Favreau, the four-part documentary \\"Ultimate Iron Man: The Making of Iron Man 2\\", 6 behind-the-scenes featurettes (Creating Stark Expo, Practical Meets Digital, Illustrated Origin: Nick Fury, Illustrated Origin: Black Widow, Illustrated Origin: War Machine & Working With DJ AM), picture galleries, trailers and 8 deleted scenes. Overall, \\"Iron Man 2\\" scores an \\"A-\\".
B00AN0KBJC|5|Great characters, dialogue, storyline and visual effects. One of the best shows available right now. It's addicting so don't say you haven't been warned.
B008YKGQR4|4|Really nice to see the full facebook page.  I can share to other people.  Sometimes it won't open and the screen is just dark, but when you click it back it usually starts off.  Overall I highly recommend.
B009SQR28A|5|It was a true Christmas surprise to see this movie with the family.  None of us had ever heard of it and yet everybody walked away with a smile. Full of British humor and feel good moments -- it is a great option for children, teens, and adults. Merry Christmas!
B00003CY0V|4|This is a high action movie with the some really good scenes that will capture your interest.  It has some faults but for the most part it is entertaining.  The movie starts in the middle of a massive standoff at a bank that is being robbed.  All of the bank's workers and customers are wired with vests of 20 pounds of C4 high explosives and containing large ball bearings weighing 15 pounds that are extremely dangerous.  One of the hostages is grabbed by the police and when they get her out of radio range the bomb explodes and it is a horrific scene.<br /><br />Meanwhile a flashback takes you to a scene where a key member of the criminal team is stopped at the airport as he is a known international hacker of computers.  They now need a replacement and they go after an unwilling man named Staley Jobson (Hugh Jackman).  They send Ginger (Halle Berry) to go pick him up. He refuses because if he even touches a computer he goes back to Leavenworth as he is on probation for hacking into the FBI computer systems......<br /><br />I liked this movie for entertainment as it is full of action and it has a twisting and intelligent plot.  The objective is not to rob the bank but to steal billions from the government.  I liked the flow of the movie and the film has a lot of top notch cast members that do a great job in playing their roles.  If you like action films then you should watch this movie.
B000JCSPG0|5|Stargate is a very decent sci-fi movie. &#34;What if&#34; there was an apparatus that would allow a person to move from one location to another by walking forward? &#34;What if&#34; the Ancient Egyptians really were alien lifeforms who had come to Earth?<br /><br />Stargate has a great cast starting with Kurt Russell in an oh, so comfortable role of soldier. Russell has played so many soldiers over the years that this is no stretch. It's as if he was sliding into his afternoon, &#34;I'm done with work&#34; clothes. Jaye Davidson's performance as Ra was splendid. Coming off the superb portrayal of Dil in Crying Game, Davidson was definitely in the mood to work.<br /><br />As a movie, this was intriguing. Don't get caught up in the costuming and make up, although for the most part, that was very good as well. The concept of the movie, the very thought that thousands of years ago these people were on Earth, that's mind boggling.<br /><br />Stargate is a watch and watch again movie.
B00000JPH6|2|Here's the elephant in the room about  this movie: It's boring. It's technically masterful and wonderfully-crafted, but part of the reason why nobody really remembers it is that for all of that work, it just isn't all that interesting. And as an adult, I find much of it to be a bit silly: lots of effort coming up with a ton of goofy species, both in name and in design. Ridiculous fake languages. It's hard for me to fathom that scores of children would take an interest in it because it is so dry (and dark). A somber child might. But this movie tries awfully hard to be philosophical and misses a chance to be thrilling, endearing, or captivating. The only character who you really care anything about is Fizzgig, the furry dog-like creature. And he can't even talk.<br /><br />I LOVE the Muppets and I LOVE Jim Henson, but to me this  just misses the mark.
B006X415GK|5|This was my daughter's first Monster High doll, but I'm sure it won't be her last. After seeing many of her friends playing with them she decided it was time to get one of her own. She spent some of her birthday money to buy this one and seems to be happy with it.
B00I2TV3NO|4|Very good and held me spellbound the entire movie. I only gave it 4.5 stars because the first movie stood on its own, whereas, Catching Fire will leave non-Hunger Games readers or movie goers in the dark as to what brought Katniss and clan to this point.

B0018RFLQ2|5|If you are in the mood for a Hollywood feel-good movie, with an appealing protagonist who overcomes adversity and triumphs by \\"just being himself\\", you can do a lot worse than \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\".  In this case the appealing protagonist is young chess prodigy Joel Waitzkin, well-played by child actor Max Pomeranc. Once Joel demonstrates an unexpected talent for chess, he faces a variety of pressures from adults and other kids and ultimately has to figure out his own path forward.  Many of the adults want him to be the next Bobby Fischer and a world-class chess champion (hence the name of the movie), but the tradeoffs involved in doing so may not be what Joel wants to do.<br /><br />Pomeranc turns in a surprisingly good performance for a child actor, delivering his lines well and portraying Joel's emotions through appropriate facial expressions.  Ben Kingsley's performance as Joel's chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini is the other noteworthy one.  The filmmakers sprinkle in archival footage of the real Bobby Fischer, and provide an interesting look inside the New York City chess scene.  They also convey the emotion and drama of intense chess matches, which can't be too easy to do on the big screen.  All this, coupled with an engrossing storyline and an appropriate ending, combine to make a feel good family movie that is appropriate for pretty much all ages.<br /><br />There are some flaws, but they are generally minor ones.  A few of the scenes, such as the confrontation between Joel's father and Joel's teacher, seem a bit contrived and perhaps over the top.  In movies such as this one, which are \\"based on a true story\\", I always assume that the filmmakers are taking dramatic license to stretch or twist the truth in order to make a better movie.  Who can say if the events in \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\" are 100% accurate?  Only a few people.  The rest of us should just enjoy the movie.
B009KHDT0C|4|Johnny Depp is a great actor, this was a pretty good movie but not as good as I had anticipated.
B005J0VPNC|5|This is such a fun app.  You take a picture with the Kindle and then you can change it with the functions to make it look different such as a hand drawn portrait or cartoony or psychedelic .  It is really fun and so easy to use.  My children love it.
0553805371|3|I'm not a scientist, and as some may ascertain from my other reviews, I am a theist, so I'm sure my review of Hawking's new book will be disregarded by some who read it. My current interest lies in trying to make sense of the disparity between the findings of modern science and the (often problematic) assertions of modern religion, and to that end, I make a diligent effort not to be dismissive of those who for whatever reasons don't hold my views (actually, some of my associates accuse me of giving theism's critics too much credit). It would certainly be irresponsible of me to dismiss the work of a scientist so accomplished and brilliant as Dr. Hawking simply because our worldviews disagree, and I greatly enjoy his writing, so although I 'knew the ending' going in, I read this book with great fervor.<br /><br />There are three ways to approach 'The Grand Design' in parallel: as a history primer on the subject of quantum physics and its relation to cosmology, as a snapshot on the state of the field, and as a predictive treatise on where it's headed. To those ends, the book works well. As others have pointed out, the history and the science are both pretty basic, but that should be expected- the book wasn't written for Dr. Hawking's colleagues and professional peers, but for laypeople and those with little formal understanding of a daunting and nuanced topic. The intended audience should walk away with a solid broad comprehension of how this area of science got where it is. Dr. Hawking does a marvelous job of summarizing the problems and challenges facing modern theorists in an accessible way, and the expectations and predictions he discusses follow easily from this summary. By the end, the reader should feel somewhat comfortable thinking about the subject of theoretical physics in the abstract.<br /><br />Why three stars? Well, a very basic review is by definition unspectacular, and more space COULD have been given to further flesh out some of the concepts and address some that were omitted for brevity's sake. I think Dr. H may have kept things intentionally brief so he more readers would see it through to the end of the book, but I find the explanations supporting his conclusions about the possibility of something arising from nothing to be very lacking. It's as though he develops each point of the argument very carefully (relatively so, given the book's shortness), then hits the reader with his conclusions quickly and with hardly any elaboration whatsoever. I really don't think this takes much away from its readability or usefulness, but it's noteworthy, because I was no more convinced of the universe's 'ex nihilo' origins after reading it than I was before.<br /><br />I prefaced my review by noting that I'm not a professional or academic scientist because I'm certain that if my review draws any criticisms, they will be variations on the theme that I just don't 'get it' because I don't know enough about the topic. That may be, but if Dr. Hawking's objective was to make his esoteric conclusions accessible, he failed. Nevertheless, he succeeded at something that is, to my way of thinking, more universal and more valuable: making quantum physics accessible and enjoyable for the 'unwashed masses'.omitted for brevity's sake. I think Dr. H may have kept things intentionally brief so he more readers would see it through to the end of the book, but I find the explanations supporting his conclusions about the possibility of something arising from nothing to be very lacking. It's as though he develops each point of the argument very carefully (relatively so, given the book's shortness), then hits the reader with his conclusions quickly and with hardly any elaboration whatsoever. I really don't think this takes much away from its readability or usefulness, but it's noteworthy, because I was no more convinced of the universe's 'ex nihilo' origins after reading it than I was before.    I prefaced my review by noting that I'm not a professional or academic scientist because I'm certain that if my review draws any criticisms, they will be variations on the theme that I just don't 'get it' because I don't know enough about the topic. That may be, but if Dr. Hawking's objective was to make his esoteric conclusions accessible, he failed. Nevertheless, he succeeded at something that is, to my way of thinking, more universal and more valuable: making quantum physics accessible and enjoyable for the 'unwashed masses'.
B00E8H7DKG|3|This is not a perfect book, but it is unique, and if you skim the first 400 or so pages, the last 300 (of some 700) are a pretty good attempt to apply what's known about behavior to social changes in violence and manners over time. The basic topic is: how does our genetics control and limit social change? Surprisingly he fails to describe the nature of kin selection (inclusive fitness) which explains much of animal and human social life. He also (like nearly everyone) lacks a clear framework for describing the logical structure of rationality (LSR—John Searle’s preferred term) which I prefer to call the Descriptive Psychology of Higher Order Thought (DPHOT). Mostly the criticisms given by others are nit-picking and irrelevant and, as Pinker has said, he could not write a coherent book about &#34;bad things&#34;, nor could he give every possible reference and point of view, but he should have said at least something about the many other ways of abusing and exploiting people and the planet, since these are now so much more severe as to render other forms of violence irrelevant.<br /><br />Extending the concept of violence to include the global long term consequences of replication of someone’s genes, and having a grasp of the nature of how evolution works (i.e., kin selection) will provide a very different perspective on history, current events, and how things are likely to go in the next few hundred years. One might start by noting that the decrease in physical violence over history has been matched (and made possible) by the constantly increasing merciless rape of the planet (i.e., by people's destruction of their own descendants future). Pinker (like most people most of the time) is often distracted by the superficialities of culture when it’s biology that matters. See my recent reviews of Wilson’s ‘The Social Conquest of Earth’ and Nowak and Highfield’s ‘SuperCooperators’ for a brief summary of the vacuity of altruism and the operation of kin selection and the uselessness and superficiality of describing behavior in cultural terms.<br />This is the classic nature/nurture issue and nature trumps nurture --infinitely. What really matters is the violence done to the earth by the relentless increase in population and resource destruction (due to medicine and technology and conflict suppression by police and military).  About 200,000 more people a day (another Las Vegas every 3 days, another Los Angeles every three weeks), the 12 tons or so of topsoil going into the sea/person/year etc. mean that unless some miracle happens the biosphere and civilization will largely collapse in the next two centuries and there will be starvation, misery and violence of every kind on a staggering scale. People's manners, opinions and tendencies to commit violent acts are of no relevance unless they can do something to avoid this catastrophe, and I don't see how that is going to happen. There is no space for arguments, and no point either (yes I'm a fatalist), so I'll just make a few comments as though they were facts. Don't imagine I have a personal stake in promoting one group at the expense of others. I am 73, have no descendants and no close relatives and do not identify with any political, national or religious group and regard the ones I belong to by default as just as repulsive as all the rest.<br /><br />Parents are the worst Enemies of Life on Earth and, taking the broad view of things, women are as violent as men when one considers the fact that women's violence (like most of that done by men) is largely done in slow motion, at a distance in time and space and mostly carried out by proxy -by their descendants and by men. Increasingly, women bear children regardless of whether they have a mate and the effect of stopping one woman from breeding is on average much greater than stopping one man, since they are the reproductive bottleneck.  One can take the view that people and their offspring richly deserve whatever misery comes their way and (with rare exceptions) the rich and famous are the worst offenders. Meryl Streep or Bill Gates and each of their kids may destroy 50 tons of topsoil each per year for generations into the future, while an Indian farmer and his may destroy 1 ton. If someone denies it that's fine, and to their descendants I say &#34;Welcome to Hell on Earth&#34;(WTHOE).<br /><br />The emphasis nowadays is always on Human Rights, but it is clear that if civilization is to stand a chance, Human Responsibilities must replace Human Rights. Nobody gets rights without being a responsible citizen and the first thing this means is minimal environmental destruction . The most basic responsibility is no children unless your society asks you to produce them. A society or a world that lets people breed at random will always be exploited by selfish genes until it collapses (or reaches a point where life is so horrific it's not worth living). If society continues to maintain Human Rights as primary, that's fine and to their descendants one can say with confidence &#34;WTHOE&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Helping&#34; has to be seen from a global long term perspective. Almost all &#34;help&#34; that's given by individuals, organizations or countries harms others and the world in the long run and must only be given after very careful consideration. If you want to hand out money, food, medicine, etc., you need to ask what the long term environmental consequences are. If you want to please everyone all the time, that's fine and again to your descendants I say &#34;WTHOE&#34;.<br /><br />Dysgenics: endless trillions of creatures beginning with bacteria-like forms over 3 billion years ago have died to create us and all current life and this is called eugenics, evolution by natural selection or kin selection (inclusive fitness). We all have &#34;bad genes&#34; but some are worse than others. It is estimated that up to 50% of all human conceptions end in spontaneous abortion due to &#34;bad genes&#34;. Civilization is dysgenic. This problem is currently trivial compared to overpopulation but getting worse by the day. Medicine, welfare, democracy, equality, justice, human rights and &#34;helping&#34; of all kinds have global long term dysgenic consequences which will collapse society even if population growth stops. Again if the world refuses to believe it or doesn't want to deal with it that's fine and to their (and everyone’s) descendants we can say &#34;WTHOE&#34;.<br /><br />Beware the utopian scenarios that suggest doomsday can be avoided by judicious application of technologies. As they say you can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you can't fool mother nature any of the time. I leave you with just one example. Famous scientist Raymond Kurzweil proposed nanobots as the saviors of humankind. They would make anything we needed and clean every mess. They would even make ever better versions of themselves. They would keep us as pets. But think of how many people treat their pets, and pets are overpopulating and destroying and becoming dysgenic almost as fast as humans (e.g. feral cats alone kill perhaps 100 billion wild animals a year). Pets only exist because we destroy the earth to feed them and we have spay and neuter clinics and euthanize the sick and unwanted ones. We practice rigorous population control and eugenics on them deliberately and by omission, and no form of life can evolve or exist without these two controls—not even bots. And what's to stop nanobots from evolving? Any change that facilitated reproduction would automatically be selected for and any behavior that wasted time or energy (i.e., taking care of humans) would be heavily selected against. What would stop the bots program from mutating into a homicidal form and exploiting all earth's resources causing global collapse? There is no free lunch for bots either and to them too we can confidently say &#34;WTHOE&#34;.<br />This is where any thoughts about the world and human behavior must lead an educated person but Pinker says nothing about it. So the first 400 pages of this book can be skipped and the last 300 read as a nice summary of EP (evolutionary psychology) as of 2011. However, as in his other books and nearly universally in the behavioral sciences, there is no clear broad framework for intentionality as pioneered by Wittgenstein, Searle and many others. I have presented such a framework in my many reviews of works by and about these two natural psychological geniuses and will not repeat it here.nes&#34;. Civilization is dysgenic.

B000002KLP|5|SO their I was sitting in my college radio station, and I pulled this (CD now) old record out of the back by the door row, and said to the DJ that was  , bout half my age (I am 60) \\"hey what would you do if your sister came home with him\\". He laughed, and I said \\"have you ever heard of Prince\\", he said that his older brother was into him at the tail end of his career, but I have never seen that album. I said, how about a bet; if you can play the whole CD right through without interruption. So he put in on because I told him, it was not just good, in my opinion it is in the top 100 albums of all time, if you play it right through on this Friday night on campus. So he did, and the phones exploded to find out all sorts of information. I gave him all the information I could. It could not be played on the radio. It was clearly the best party album of my youth, but you had to play it loud. He broke in and told everyone to turn up their stereos. That was it. In a matter of minutes, I went from old man, to rock god. I thanked him and went home, and dug out my vinyl. I put it on loud and I was satiated for about an hour. It bought back a lot of sex dreams, but I noticed, as did he, that if you put this CD out today, people would still say \\"this is Prince, it is so raw\\".......yup raw and classic.
B00AESN8XY|5|So much fun destroying the human race. Mwhahahahahaha!!!! It fun being an evil scientist. Really loved this game you should get it.
B0089LOG02|5|I love historical fiction and this was a good book. It was a good blend of current events and past history
B004J4WKUQ|5|Read the book now so the movie can disappoint you later. Well written, packed full of great pop culture references. I will warm you that the first few chapters start of slow but the rest of the book so speeds by.
B00DPM90C4|5|This was an outstanding book; very crisply written with excellent character development.  It was scary as it is something, I imagine, that could happen.  Don't want to spoil the story so I won't go into too much plot detail.  I seldom give a book five stars but this book kept me on edge and reading into the wee hours of the morning every night until I finished it.  It is a timely novel in that the adversaries are those we are familiar with and this makes the book even more riveting. I will most definitely recommend this to friends and family.  In fact, I ordered this on my Kindle but will order the physical book for a family member who also wants to read it. She is anti-tech and does not have a Kindle thus the ordering of the &#34;book I can hold in my hands.&#34;  Again, excellent novel.
0385006896|5|These are the best detective stories ever written.  I think that Sir Conan Doyle had defind the detective story.  I grew up on it and I still like it.
B00BVYNSLC|5|This fast paced thriller always keeps you guessing and wanting more. Tatiana is one of the most talented and versatile actresses I've ever seen. My husband and I are very particular about the shows we watch. We are both hooked on this one.
B0041VXGRS|5|This book is great for beginner in baking it has very detailed information, and all items seem fairly easy to create.
B00005JKZT|2|Absurd changes to Theoden, Grima, Gimli, Saruman, Aragorn, the Battle of Helms Deep, Treebeard, Gollum and the dynamic between Frodo and Sam, as well as some gratuitous special effects (why have the Nazgul flying scenes?  How do they further the story?), make this, as a faithful version of the book of the same name, only a one-star film.<br />What gives it two stars are the special effects generally, and the event-like nature of experiencing the film.  Once those effects are no longer the \\"newest-latest\\" and once watching the film is no longer an event, I'll probably agree with every single awards list on Earth and patently ignore the rather horrid acting (except for Miranda Otto, who is perfect as Eowyn, even if she's been driven to a silly \\"love triangle\\" role in the script), and be forced to lower the rating even further.<br />Dwarf comedy indeed...<br />If Peter Jackson wanted to make his own fantasy film, why call it The Two Towers and use characters from someone else's work?<br />It's not like Tolkien needed exposuure or anything; the literary work was valued so much that Lord of the Rings is the second-most popular book ever...behind only the Bible.<br />Second most popular EVER.<br />But instead of a faithful rendition, we get Aragorn over a cliff in a made-up Warg battle, and Faramir taking the ring to Osgiliath, in clear \\"violation\\" of who Faramir was?<br />Again, PJ should have had the courage to make his own film, and conceive his own characters.  To do much of that under the cowardice of making money off of someone else's characters and basic storyline, is rather sad.
6304510861|1|I know many people here enjoyed this movie, but, personally, I found it a let down. After hearing so many good reviews about David Lynch's work, I decided to give the movie a spin.<br />While the music was chilling and  well-composed, the cast &quot;stellar&quot;, and some scenes quite  disturbing, the over-all effect was convoluted and confusing. I had trouble  following this loopy script, and spent much of the time getting up to  refill my Coke cup.<br />If you want something dark and unusual, go with Jean  Pierre Jeunet or Terry Gilliam, or even the early Chris Carter. If you want  to annoy yourself, go with Lost Highway.<br />Note: on it's own, each aspect  of this movie was great. The acting was great, the photography was great  and the scary lipsticked dude chilled my blood. Put together, however, only  distracted from what could've been a great short story or novella. I think  Lynch has a wonderful and fascinating mind, but would probably be better  off writing novels over movie scripts.
0385352859|4|Another entry in the &#34;harrowing but beautiful&#34; literature files.  The Narrow Road is an outstanding novel, well worth the investment of time.  But go in knowing that it takes an emotional toll.  This is not a happy tale...
B000WDS04I|5|How I Met Your Mother is one of the funniest sit-coms I have ever watched. Its up there with Sienfeld
B00G5G7K7O|5|This was a great movie and my whole family loves it.
B009ZQFSRA|1|Thought if it had Christian bale in it, it had to be good.  I bet he felt like an idiot doing this movie.
B004XUMMFE|5|An amazing series. Imagine if the old westerns were still a way of life, even after we reached the depths of space. The show follows a small crew aboard the Firefly class ship &#34;Serenity&#34;. They are a simple group just trying to keep a low profile as they do shady jobs to keep the ship fueled and food on the table. Unfortunately for them, fate is not kind so everyone seems to want them dead. The mightly Alliance wants to shoot these outlaws out of the sky, the animalistic Reavers think they might make a tasty snack, and just about everyone else want to do business with them, only to betray them.<br /><br />The show is funny, action packed and thought provoking. The &#34;morals&#34; of the story are often twisted into what would better fit the reasoning of outlaws on the run, but also seem to ring true. A very different way of thinking if you've watched Star Trek.
B00H7KJRVY|5|excellent!
B00ARHAAZ6|5|As always a compelling and gripping read with all of the character and world building we expect and love from Brandon Sanderson. Very thought provoking on the human condition in accepting extraordinary power and the giving and receiving of love.
B009GXHOW4|5|Easy and simple to use, Adds in glitches items for a new experience, I love how simple it is. Perfect for a child or from an adult crafter also. Amazing from my opinion.
B006DX4PRC|5|This movie is fantastic!!! It is a great romantic comedy with an excellent cast and a great story line.  I would recommend it to anyone!!!!!
B004EPZ08O|4|I had purchased this movie because I had ordered the final destination 4 in one set(which I got a good deal on here) and wanted to complete my series. I have seen this movie before and wanted to own it. I'm glad that I bought it. the seller is one that I trust. I believe I bought it from Go Hastings. I have ordered from them a few times before and had been satisfied. The shipping on this item was fast. It always is when I buy from them.
B0002NIRIC|4|As per description does it work as said
B00110K62U|5|I have all cd/dvd/tapes etc made of 'Les Miserable' and they are all very enjoyable in their own way but, for me as a huge fan of 'Les Mis' I have to say that the 1995 10 year anniversary show from Earls Court was superbly done by all concerned from the back stage to Cameron Mackintosh....and the two lead parts inparticular (ValJean & Javert) Colm Wilkinson and Philip Quast made that show something very special backed up very admirably by all other cast members.  I was at that show and I was apsolutely taken aback with the power of the production....simply amazing.  Anyone considering buying this show edition which is definitely miles better than other versions, edited or otherwise, (Not demeaning those I have to say) I highly recommend this original version. Buy it and you will be like me watching it every opportune moment.   Finally can I add a footnote....Susan Boyle did a great job of 'I dream the dream' but once again in no way does her version compere to the rendition by Ruthie Henshall as Fantine....MAGICAL is the thing that comes to mind.    If you think you have seen Les Mis...you haven't until you watch this....sound well up for atmosphere,  good bottle of wine with some 'bites' snacks, wife or partner close by, 4 hours to spare and you will think you are heaven.  I rest my case and thank you for reading this review.  Thankyou  Showman.
B00A9T1HUO|5|Josh always seems to amaze me.  His wonderful voice has no competition in todays music field.  He is tried and true!
B0031KC8OC|5|An awesome show! Got a few recommendations from friends so I finally started watching. So addicting! Not your average high school drama crap. It's actually a pretty complex and often dark murder mystery type of show, and the acting is great. Most definitely recommend.
B00B2PHSIY|5|Made my underwater footage really look great (can't say the same for the camera work).  Looking forward to using it again soon.  Perfect product at an unbeatable price.  If you do even a tiny amount of underwater filming with your GoPro, pick this little gem up.  You can throw it in your case and forget it but when you need it, you'll be stoked you have it.
B001F12J0C|4|3 great action flicks in a series for $20 in DVD format, with extras -what's not to like???????????? Buy them!!!
B0057URWSQ|5|I love this show! It has eye candy for both genders. I love the little twists even though some are predictable.. Gimme more!
B00008PW3Q|2|I really was quite open-minded about Fleetwood Mac (sans Christine McVie) doing a reunion album. I decided not to see the Mac when the tour came to Cincinnati last year (not at $78-$128 ticket prices anyway), but when I had the chance, I picked up the album pretty cheap. I have to say I was quite surprised with what I heard.<br />As &quot;Say You Will&quot; (18 tracks, 76 min.) plays along, you can immediately pick out the songs penned by Lindsay and the ones penned by Stevie. Low and behold, as by chance, each gets to deliver 9 tracks to the album, which at 76 min. truly is 2 solo albums collated together, albeit with the great backing of John McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums. I can only imagine the tension of sequencing the tracks: after Lindsay gets the first 2 tracks, Stevie prob said, if I don't get the next one, I'm walking. So track 3 &quot;Illume&quot; is a Stevie track, as is track 4! And so on. I guess I wouldn't mind it so much if the music was first class, but the problem is that (surprisingly) there are no really great songs here. I wish I could be more positive, but it all sounds so average, so middle-of-the-road!<br />Who woulda thunk that Christine McVie would've been missed so badly? But the proof is in the pudding: her pop-savvy is missed sorely. As for &quot;Say You Will&quot;: it just doesn't feel like a Fleetwood Mac album, sorry.

B0030ZOYHC|5|This movie is the first in a series of four (though only 2 have been released in English, and the third should be coming out sometime in 2014), and is a beautiful piece of animation. I would reccomend it to fans of Evangelion, mecha anime, or animation in general. The blu-ray clarity is awesome and makes every detail visible.<br /><br />I was a bit bummed that the film didn't have an audio commentary, however, the other features and the film itself more than  make up for it.<br /><br />Check out the second film, Evangelion 2.22, as well!<br /><br />And don't forget to clean your ears!
0375842209|1|I had a very hard time getting into this book.  I tried...I really tried, but after battling my way through 1/3 of the book, i just couldn't take it anymore and gave it back to my friend.  Characters were thin, the writing and descriptions didn't make it feel like wartime or in the late 30's, and Death's narrative was disjointed and hard to follow..  All in all, it was a poorly written book that need more to it to help &#34;fill in&#34; the narrative and story holes so you could read it and actually feel something for the characters.
B0054TKAZW|5|I'm 69 years old, and didn't expect to like this series, but my daughter and grand-daughter both love it, so I gave it a try.<br />Excellent production values, good acting, and fine scripts. Give it a try, too!

B009KHDT0C|5|Dark Shadows plus Johnny Depp--what more could I ask?  I have all the DVD's of the original TV version of Dark Shadows and have loved it for many years.  I watched the originals when I was a young mother--yes, I'm that old.  When I saw that Tim Burton was reviving my favorite stories, starring Johnny Depp, I couldn't wait to see it.  I was not disappointed.  The movie stayed quite true to the original, with just enough camp to make it fun to watch. Casting was perfect, and to see Jonathan Frid make an appearance was the crowning jewel. I highly recommend this DVD, especially for anyone old enough to remember the original Dark Shadows.
B008JFUPK8|5|I think this was the best superman movie ever. Henry Cavill was great and I love Amy Adams. I would recommend this movie.

B00L9B7IKE|3|Entertaining read. Strong characterization developed through characters ' action and dialogue. Plot development dragged both in the beginning of the novel and about midway through the book. What a group of dysfunctional individuals! For me the ending was too easy to predict.
1594632383|3|Amazing book I'd give four stars, however, the &#34;like new&#34; book I purchased had large brown splotches on several pages. This would not have been a problem if it was outlined in the description, but describing the book as &#34;like new&#34; was dishonest.

B000002IJO|5|Ratt was one of my favorite bands from the 80's. Their first two full albums &quot;Out of the Cellar&quot; and &quot;Invasion of your Privacy&quot; were very good, but for me, this is where the band put it all together. Never have they sounded so smooth and tight, with razor sharp guitars and great hooks throughout. &quot;Dance&quot;, &quot;Body Talk&quot;, &quot;One good Lover&quot; etc. are all outstanding 80's hard rock. If you get one RATT album, this is the one

0765350386|5|Okay, maybe using the word brilliance was a little over the top. But Mistborn is definately a must read novel.<br /><br />Vin is a street urchin, making a living by surviving, until one day she is rescued by Kelsier. He and his companions show her what it is like to trust and be trusted, something she had been steadfastly trained was impossible. During all of this the crew works together to bring down the Lord Ruler, an evil man beyond compare. He rules with a ruthless iron fist. His whim is law.<br /><br />In the end Sanderson throws in a twist that would make any writer envy. Mistborn is not a book to be missed. It's no wonder that Robert Jordan's wife insisted that he be the one to write the final Wheel of Time book. Sanderson has a flare that can only make Jordan's series better.<br /><br />Check out my own title:[[ASIN:1434898962 Blood Forsaken (Paperback)]]

Much as the Ohio 4.0 earthquake is blamed on hydraulic pressure nearby the epicenter is rather like your kicking Mt. Everest with bare feet hoping to knock it over. Learn some physics and math and quit trying to become the next scientific charlatan after Al Gore. Even that dope of a movie by meddling lawyer Erin Brokovitch was proven statistically way off the beam regarding the norm and illnesses supposedly caused by that plant. But movies and Hollow-Wood-For-Heads just can't seem to B.S. the world enough to become the capitalists they hate and the intellectually lazy and dead of head  eat it up like chocolate chip cookies right from the oven.

B000Q6GX5Y|4|I love this movie.<br />I have the normal dvd.<br />I bought this with the idea that it would be a substantial improvement in sound and video.<br />It was not substantial.<br />BUT, neither do I have a high-end TV.<br /><br />From what I hear, Blu-Ray upgrades tend to provide greater sound upgrade then visual.<br /><br />I hope this helps.
B00000IUKQ|3|Quick and easy bridge. The archway is too narrow for track and the incline is too steep for the three battery-operated engines we have to chug up on their own. We've found that the BRIO Ascending Track, combined with some Stacking Track Supports works way better.

0812550706|5|I have read the whole ender series, but with a strange sequence which may have affected the way I view the different books in the series. The first book I have read was the Shadow of the Hegemon, thanks to a tourist that had left it in the library of a hotel in Skiathos island. This book got me hooked, but it confused me also as I didn't know if I should start reading the next books or the previous ones. <br /> <br />The general pattern in the whole series is: <br />The beginning book is Ender's Game. Then we have two subcategories, one the Shadow series (which, with the exception of the first book, take place on earth and are more within military strategy) and one the Ender series (which take place in space and are more into new sci-fi ideas). Shadow series probably can be read from everyone, while I guess that the Ender series (especially from Speaker for the Dead onwards) would be read mainly from sci-fi fans. <br />Below are my comments for the books of the series, in the order I have read them and a marking (10 is the highest mark): <br /> <br />Shadow of the Hegemon: The first book I have read, and which I could not leave from my hands. I finished it in 2 days. It was fast paced action, very smart plot and after reading it I believed that Orson Scot Card (OSC) has invented/re-invented a new genre of literature. That of military strategy and adventure combined with brilliance/mind games and hidden portions of romance. Such books always existed but this seemed to be THE book. It was like the way Dan Brown re-invented books with trivials and puzzles, together with fast paced adventure. I strongly recommend it to everybody that likes such type of books. (mark: 10) <br /> <br />Shadow puppets: The sequel to the above. I found it interesting but somehow boring as the above story developed little and the focus was on the characters (maybe too much focus so that it seemed to me that it was slightly mumbling jumbling. Strategy, brilliance and adventure seemed to be very low here. I would not recommend it for anybody to read it in isolate, unfortunately you have to read it if you want to go to the next book. I really believe that OSC made a mistake here (deliberately or not) as this book should have been told in 50-60 pages and be included in the previous or the next book. (mark: 6 but you will read it because you will want to read Shadow of the Giant) <br /> <br />Shadow of the Giant: (see below) <br /> <br />Ender's game: A really great book to read, probably the best of the series, however, as I had read its sequels first, when I reached the 80% of this book, I had predicted the end. However, it's at the highest standards of sci-fi, military strategy, adventure, brilliant mind games and very good depth in the human aspect of the characters. In comparison to the shadow series, it is more \\"space\\" sci-fi, while shadow series have much lesser sci-fi elements and are more down to earth. (mark: 10) <br /> <br />Speaker for the dead: Another great book, but different style. Less adventure, more human aspect, more maturity. Brilliance yes, but not military, sci-fi yes (some great ideas) but not spaceship style. (Mark: 9) <br /> <br />Xenocide: A good sequel of the previous novel. In certain points more brilliant, in other sections more boring, however is again a very good sci-fi book. The only flaw in these series (Speker for the dead, Xenocide, Children of the mind) is the idea behind one of the alien species described which I found outrageously extreme, however if you ignore it becomes first class reading. (Mark: 9) <br /> <br />Children of the mind: I think that OSC has wrapped up his case pretty badly in that one. It's a fair book except the fact that I felt that OSC mumbles jumbles for one third of the novel not having decided how to end it. In other critiques I have found it described as nice approach to moral dilemmas, however, moral dilemma is when you describe it once and make your choice, while here the dilemma is repeated and repeated... I felt like I was watching a movie worth 10 oscars and the end did not worth to be included even in a cheap video movie. And again, many open ends at the end (for possible sequels). (Mark: 7 but you will read it as you will be hooked from the previous ones). <br /> <br />Ender's shadow: Having read Enders Game and Shadow of the Hegemon, I found this book probably the best of the series, which of course is my subjective preference. I could characterize it as probably the best book I have read ever! Not to repeat myself, it has all that Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Game have, and even more...(Mark: the absolute 10). <br /> <br />Shadow of the Giant: When I read shadow puppets, I said, \\"that's it, OSC has lost either his talent or his appetite for good writing...\\", so I was pretty unwilling to read it. Fortunately I decided to, as it proved to be a good one, were I believe that OSC has nicely wrapped up his story, with two small flaws.  <br />* The one is described below (its end needed to be slightly more complete) and, <br />* The other is the fact that although he describes certain smart battles, he does not focus enough on them as it seems that he is in a hurry to wrap all things up. It had all elements to become a masterpiece but it ended up being a good to read book (Mark: 9) <br /> <br />In general, both series have three categories of good stuff: <br />1) Some great sci-fi ideas (battle room, battle games, fantasy game, ansible, aia, Jane, in/out travel, raman varelse etc) <br />2) Great military strategy, mind games etc combined with adventure <br />3) In certain books, depth of characters, moral dilemmas etc <br />And two main bad stuff: <br />1) Mumbling jumbling in certain books which was completely unnecessary (either OSC wanted just to produce and sell another title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how the story will continue-see last book of Ender series). <br />2) One of the alien species described in the Ender series wasso too outrageous even for sci-fi that made it look ridiculous. The idea behind it was brilliant in sci-fi terms, but he could try a different living organism... <br />Finally, OSC has left open ends in both series (probably for next sequels), however I believe that there are two things missing. a) the story of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, told in a metaphorical manner so it means much for humanity. b) In ancient theatre, a story should end in a way that brings \\"katharsis\\" to the story, and the souls of the readers. I believe that the end of the shadow of the giant may be smart for commercial purposes but it was very unfair to the reader as it did not bring full \\"katharsis\\". <br />

B000AP04FG|4|There's no shortage of screen chemistry between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in this action-filled romantic comedy from \\"Fair Game\\" director Doug Liman. In fact, the gunplay, fisticuffs and chases remain secondary to Brad and Angelina's considerable star power - a rarity in today's cineplex environment. \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" (2005) is refreshingly old-fashioned in the classic Hollywood tradition.

It has the aforementioned illegal diamond trade, civil war, mercenaries, and greedy industrialists only interested in exploiting a nation and it's people for their profits!

1423140605|4|Rick Roirdan's The Mark of Athena takes us closer towards the end of our mythical journey in the book series: The Heroes of Olympus. Through this modern take on Greek and Roman mythology, Roirdan introduces us to the seven demi-gods who are destined by a prophecy to save the world from Gaea, the earth goddess, by closing the Doors of Death. The story focuses on Annabeth, the daughter of Athena (the goddess of war and wisdom), who is given the impossible task of finding the mark of Athena, hence the name of the book. The legend started when the Romans stole a statue from the Greek goddess, which forced her to turn into her Roman form (Minerva). After this, Athena has been persuading her demi-god children to follow the \\"mark\\" and return what rightfully belongs to her.  Along the way, readers will meet many Gods and creatures like Zeus, Dionysus, Hera, centaurs, and nymphs, and experience many epic battles between the Romans and Greeks.<br /> With its epic battles, famous Gods, and ancient mythological creatures, this novel was truly a page-turner for me and I enjoyed it very much.  The author was successful in keeping the story exciting by leaving the readers with cliffhangers by the end of every chapter. As the reader, I was able to follow the development of these characters as they faced many challenges. I recommend this book to anyone who is a teen or older and is looking for adventure.
0786965614|4|I'm not a big fan of how &#34;resistance&#34; and things work now, but I have to say this book is pretty and laid out nicely.

B00866JL96|3|JK Rowling has the Harry Potter Series, Stephenie Meyer has the Twilight Series, and Nicholas Sparks has the Nicholas Sparks recipe book series. Sparks is the Sparks Author of romantic stories where the main characters usually don't experience the typical happy ending, characters questioning their Christian belief or faith, and whose stories tend to center around a tragedy.  He sells everything he writes and many of his books are readily adapted into blockbuster movies: The Lucky One, The Notebook, The Last Song, A Walk to Remember, Dear John, Message in a Bottle, and Nights in Rodanthe. Though the stories are repetitive and filled with clich&eacute; phrases such as `How do you explain something that you can't even understand yourself?' they do serve an audience hungry for these kinds of tales.  THE LUCKY ONE won't let those people down.<br /><br />Sgt. Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) is a marine serving in Iraq and we are introduced after some lugubrious footage to the actual war scenes in Iraq where Logan finds a photo of a girl with \\"keep safe\\" written on the back. He is admiring it when his unit is attacked. He survives and credits the photo for saving him. He tries to find the owner but can't, assuming he was killed. When he goes back to the States, he finds it difficult to adjust and is still haunted by what happened. Analyzing the photo, he finds in the background a landmark that tells him she is in Louisiana. He then goes there and finds her. He learns her name is Beth (Taylor Schilling), a divorced mother of a cute kid Ben (Riley Thomas Stewart) whose loathsome sheriff ex-husband Keith (Jay R. Ferguson), who happens to be the son of the small town Judge Clayton (Adam LeFevre), makes life miserable for Beth. Beth and her grandmother Ellie (Blythe Danner) still mourn the loss of Beth's brother drake who is still `missing in action' in Iraq. Logan tries to tell her what happened but can't get the words out. She assumes he's there to apply for the job they advertised looking for someone to help at her family's business, a dog kennel. He says yes but at first she gets an uneasy feeling from him but Ellie decides to give him a chance. It isn't long that he makes a connection with Ben and his music ability, has confrontations with Keith, and the rest is entirely predictable Sparks-type ending.<br /><br />Will Fetters adapted this one for the screen and Scott Hicks directs with a rather heavy hand on the organ tremolo. Of the cast Blythe Danner gives her usual excellent professionalism. The rest of the cast is according to the tastes of the viewers. Efron apparently beefed up his physique for the role but forgot to beef up the acting. The film could stand a good editing to relieve the ennui.

6305897786|1|If you're considering buying this movie because you are interested in  Roman polanski, go ahead and buy it. You will get the usual slow moving  (not counting CHINATOWN) story and while watching it you'll have plenty of  time to find out what you'll say to your friends when you explain to them  this is really ART and not just a 1 hour movie plus a lot of transport  scenes.<br />If, on the other hand, your interested in a good horror story.  Rent it first ! Chances are you'll choose to buy one more copy of THE OMEN.
B0013J1WKY|2|From an older person's perspective (past age 35), this concert is all flash and mumbles, which you may thoroughly like (the Vegas-Madonna glitz); but if you're wanting only to hear Aguilera's beautiful voice, to see her before she married and seemed a bit truer to herself in both message and looks, then opt for the &#34;Stripped&#34; concert a few years earlier.  It is there that you'll find more of her singing only with a piano or even solo, directing her message of domestic violence abuse with compassion.  In this concert, her voice and singing are glossed over, a brief interlude drowned out by the music and what seems to be poor sound engineering.  Where's that beautiful voice, something that emerges in &#34;The Hurt,&#34; her one and only venture into a slow song that shows her chops...but then it's right back into the fast paced, bright lights of the show.  Was there any feeling in there?  You won't find that here, her dancing a bit more forced, her performers still stunning and now outdancing her (maybe it's the full sheep's head of blond hair that she carries).  But again, if you want just a Broadway-Vegas performance and don't really care about what she sings or even hearing her sing, then this is the concert for you...all fireworks and flash, but little else.
B00005BJ2O|3|It is a little strange that Moulin Rouge is such a great movie, with such astounding music, yet it cannot spawn a decent soundtrack CD.  In striving to find the balance between pop CD and musical soundtrack album,  it delivers neither.<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge 2&quot; includes songs I wish had been on the original soundtrack, but is still disappoints.  The fantastic &quot;Smells like Lady Marmalade&quot; is noticeable missing.  It makes me wonder if they could not get the rights from Nirvana.  &quot;The Pitch&quot; is included, but not the full film version.  There are some unneeded remixes that add no value to the CD.  I would have loved the full version of &quot;Le Tango de Roxanne.&quot;<br />I hope that a true musical soundtrack will be released, with all of the &quot;Original Film Version&quot; songs in order and with the relevant dialog included.  Baz did a great job of resurrecting the film musical.  Keep up the good work with a two-disk soundtrack CD.

B0014BY72Q|2|Saw this years ago, but forgot about all the nudity. Plot and acting is fair though now the special effects is rather cheesy.
0440180295|5|All I can say is that this is one wacked out book.  The best line came when Billy Pilgrim was in the zoo and asked for the secret to the universe.  When the Tralmafadorians replied that it is destroyed testing fuel, Billy  asks if there is anyway to stop it.  It was great, but it was twisted.   Read with caution.  This is a very difficult time period to read from and  is very often confusing.
B005IEGUDY|3|It's an ambitious concept.  When the book started I thought it was going to take me back to the Big Bang.  I stuck with it and it got better.  It got confusing at times because the story doesn't always have smooth transitions from one period or event to another.  It also skips through major events like some of the wars that shaped England.  It's a long book and I think it would have been better if it had been done in two books and it took more time to get from one thing to the other.

B002M9WW30|4|Rocky is what it is.  We all have our battles and trials to overcome.  These movies speak to that, and to the power of a great wife for a man.  The quality of transfers is good. If you like Rocky and its theme, you'll like the series. It's not the very best movie ever made, and it's not as enduring as It's A Wonderful Life or other such timeless classics; but for fans of these types of sports themed, &#34;overcoming&#34; stories, it's good!
B009NQKPUW|1|I guess the script for this movie must have taken say 10 minutes to write. It is obviously totally derivative of \\"Aliens\\",  with more special effects, less story. Same spaceship on dubious company business, same robot as key perpetrator of said company business, same deserted planet, same dormant aliens waiting for dumb earthlings, same plans to decimate Earth, same baseball cap to prepare for the ultimate heroic sacrifice. Big change this time is that the spaceship lands in a direct line to the buried spaceships/aliens via a conveniently built road.<br />The actors are a very mixed bag - Noomi Rapace is hard to reconcile as the the mesmeric,  energetic lead in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"  - her acting in \\"Prometheus\\" is wooden to the nth degree and her facial features are reminiscent of someone post root canal - the Novocaine look. And her hair?  How the remaining actors were able keep a straight face throughout is a mystery.<br />Utter drivel with sub-themes of religion and immortality - oh and the master race.  I've seen Tom and Jerry cartoons that have better and more logical dialog - and by that yardstick - Homer Simpson is a thoughtful genius.<br />This movie is yet another sign of the decline of Western culture, aided and abetted by Hollywood greed.
B005ZOBNOI|5|A love story, a cancer story, this book is many stories. Love the way it is written and could not put it down.  And when you finish you think \\"wait a minute\\", still did not get to hear the ending of the authors book!
B000001FSU|5|Not considered by most as ANTHRAX'S best , this has always been my favorite ANTHRAX cd.every song is great- no filler.From the beginning string piece into the powerful drum beat and head banging guitar cord sequence of 'Be All, End All through to such classics as 'Anti - Social'. Into heavier tracks as 'Misery Loves Company' in which once again Charlie Benate(drummer) puts an amazing beat mixed with a classic Dan Spitz(Lead Guitar) solo. Joe Belladonna's (Vocals) distinctive voice rings out, mere perfection for the band. 'Finale' is an amazing ending track to an great album. This is a must for any thrash metal fan.
B0063IH60K|5|Love it!  Addictive and a lot of fun. Really enjoy the graphics when I win. It gives you the option of taking back a move for example if I touch the card by accident coming off the deck.

B005NPRTNS|5|Acción Ejecutiva / Executive Action, 1973 film    The movie begins with a quote from President Lyndon B. Johnson. He suspected a conspiracy caused the assassination of JFK. They show various industrial scenes as the credits roll. It is June 1963. A voice talks about the Kennedy Brothers and warns about their powers. JFK's actions are criticized. A Test Ban Treaty! Withdrawal from Vietnam! The men talk about an \\"executive action\\". We see a speech by JFK about progress for the people. They talk about presidential assassinations by fanatics. One man explains how this will work. Practice makes perfect. We hear the analysis of JFK' protection. This conspiracy will use a victim as a \\"lone gunman\\" to take the blame. We see men shooting at a target in a moving open car.    Newsreels from June 1963 tell about a Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Jim Farrington meets one leader and explains the deal. \\"You just told me who we are going to hit.\\" JFK speaks about Civil Rights. The conspirators have a \\"sponsor\\" for their plot. They review his history. They will use him. One plotter speaks about the need for population control of people in other countries. \\"Somebody must be behind him.\\" A speech in Washington is seen by the top man. Oswald is arrested for handing out leaflets, this is photographed [advance planning]. JFK signs the Test Ban Treaty in August 1963. Men with telescopic camera lens take pictures of a parade. We see the plot taking place for Dealey Plaza. The report of a future withdrawal from Vietnam makes Ferguson give the \\"go ahead\\". They send a coded message to a team leader. They got the job. They use a double to impersonate the \\"sponsor\\" and leave a false trail. Men break into a garage to steal a rifle. They create an incriminating photograph. [Easier today with digital photography.]    Was there a plot to demonstrate against Adlai Stevenson? The assassins reconnoiter the locations. Exact planning assures success. The President and Vice-President will be in Dallas together. \\"Oswald has his telephone number?\\" Oswald's mail and telephone are monitored by government agencies. [Like most other people?] JFK is greeted in Fort Worth, then flies to Dallas. The people cheer him. The assassins move into their positions. We see actual news photographs mixed in with this movie. [Just like \\"Twelve O'Clock High\\".] People watch this live on television. The assassins fire. The police search the Texas School Book Depository building. The telephone lines go dead in Washington. [Too many calls at once.] The assassins flee Dallas separately. Oswald asks for legal assistance. On Sunday Jack Ruby goes to the police station. Oswald is shot! \\"He was the killer.\\" There are photographs of the 18 material witnesses who died in the next three years. The odd against this randomly happening are exceedingly high.    While an assassination could be the work of a \\"lone gunman\\" (as `TIME' said about Lincoln's assassination), the killing of Oswald two days later suggests a conspiracy to many people. \\"The Assassination Tapes\\" book used a voice-stress analyzer to measure the recorded conversations and found that Oswald spoke the truth (or was insane). The removal of JFK resulted in only one change in policy. Executive Order 11,110 was reversed. This ordered the US Treasury to print $100 bills instead of using the more expensive Federal Reserve Notes. The US government has to pay the Fed for its own money!    Why is Oswald \\"not guilty\\"? He was never convicted or even indicted! Why was he rubbed out two days later? To prevent him from proving his innocence! Lunch time is usually around noon. If Oswald went to lunch at noon and then washed down his meal with a bottle of soda from a machine when that policeman came by. Alive, he could have named the other people who were also in the lunchroom at that time (and they could have confirmed his alibi). Then the conspiracy would be obvious. Being in the second floor lunchroom solves the problem of hiding that rifle then runningdown four flights of stairs. Yes, this is my assumption, but it best explains the problem of Oswald's movements from the sixth to the second floor.    Another argument for Oswald's innocence is his denial of shooting the President. The killers of Presidents in the 19th century all boasted of their deed. So too those in the 20th century who attempted and failed. All used a pistol. Was Oswald lying about this? George O'Toole's book \\"The Assassination Tapes\\" explains why Oswald was telling the truth (or was crazy). The idea of a conspiracy also explains the differences in wounds seen in Parkland Hospital and those on the body in Bethesda. I think the conspirators simply sacrificed JFK's double to create a body whose wounds would fit the \\"lone gunman\\" theory. Why did the Establishment bump him off? JFK's use of drugs affected his judgment and risked a Nuclear War in October 1962. The book \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" explains JFK's health problems. Doesn't this theory best fit the known facts?

B007HUD6OS|4|I chose this book due to the fact I have read every book written by John Graham. I was a little disappointed with the ending. I feel it could have had a few more chapters to make it more exciting, however I am waiting for his next book to be announced.  John Grisham is an amazing and very interesting writer.
B0031YJFCQ|5|My experience with trilogies is that at least one of the three is pretty weak (often the second), but all the books in Larsson's series are really good books. Not only are the characters unique without being too quirky, but the plots are interesting and not at all formulaic. Best of all, the writing is a cut or two above most of what is found in the genre. They are not quick reads and they do require thinking a bit to keep the wide cast of characters straight, but they are well written and a pleasure to read. Also, while the primary characters are the same in each of the novels, the plot of each is its own type of animal—each brings its own intrigue to the table without leaning too hard on the others. I think The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest may be the best of the three, but I liked them all so much, it may be just because it is the one I have read most recently. I heartily recommend them all.
B00005JKGZ|5|One of the best of the classic MGM musicals, Meet Me In St. Louis brings that America we all wish existed to life in more ways than one.  Judy Garland is at her best and it shows.  Better than Royal Wedding not as good as Singing in the Rain, MMISL is well worth owning.  Do yourself a favor, experience this great film at least once a year, you'll be glad you did.
158234082X|5|Tony Bourdain is a smart, witty, funny, and deeply twisted individual, and is also a first-rate writer whose non-fiction is as entertaining and expressive as any novel I have ever read. I first became aware of Tony through his cable television show \\"No Reservations\\" (which is the only television show that I go out of my way to see each week.) I immediately bought this book after seeing the episode on Icelandic cuisine, as I thought he was intelligent yet not another insufferable food snob. He is a man who wants to try everything and has absolutely no fear or prejudices about food and excels at telling it like it is.<br /><br />This book recounts his life and career rising to the top of the pack in the culinary world. It is a deeply personal and unvarnished look at the world of big-league professional food, and is full of insights on both food and the restaurant business. When I was younger I worked as a line cook in a relatively nice restaurant. Although my experience was somewhat less frenetic and more sanitary than the scene in New York, I can certainly attest that the cast of characters (and their flaws) revealed in this book is right on the money.<br /><br />One thing I like about Bourdain and this book is that he tells the truth even when it's ugly. He explains why, for instance, not to order meat well done or why not to even think about ordering fish on Monday. (He's right on both accounts.) He doesn't dodge his own past when others would fail to mention diversionary activities such as a heroin addiction, and even though he comes across as cantankerous, he is a guy you can take at his word.<br /><br />Some of this book is pure gold, not just for cooks and would be chefs, but for everyone. His writing (\\"Rules to Live By,\\" page 64, and \\"A Commencement Address,\\" page 293 in particular) is excellent and applies to any profession. He also shares many inside secrets of Les Halles (and other restaurants he has worked at), of winning \\"mise-en-place\\" (or just \\"meez;\\" people who really want to cook professionally should take this to heart), and technical opinions (why and how to use an offset serrated knife.)<br /><br />This book is coarse and not for the faint of heart, but if you really want to know about cooking or cooks, it is the best (and funniest) single volume ever written. I highly recommend this bookeople who really want to cook professionally should take this to heart), and technical opinions (why and how to use an offset serrated knife.)<br /><br />This book is coarse and not for the faint of heart, but if you really want to know about cooking or cooks, it is the best (and funniest) single volume ever written. I highly recommend this book
B00DUGCLY4|5|This is so great. I have really enjoyed playing it. I would recommend it to all ages. My granddaughter got me started.
B00MFDPI0M|2|Rather flavorless and unimportant take on dystopian future. It falls short in terms of pretty much everything, story, character development, world development, motivation... Nothing in this world has more than 1 dimension, and it's overly simplified. Rather sad attempt in the genre, that skims over several interesting issues and questions that make a blink-and-you've-missed-it cameos.<br />I am especially sorry to see Kate Winslet here, considering that she is one of the most capable and versatile actress out there, but not even her can save this script with its laughable  dialogs.
B002UBRFDC|5|Third reading.  Learn more each reading.  Went to Kindle to save the cost replacing paperbacks. The history is so accurate.
B00BD99JMW|5|This was an awesome series. A fast read that did not leave u waiting on the next bit of excitement. Loved all three books. Would recommend them to adults because of some language.
B007PTJOV0|5|awesome... souled recommend to anyone with a kindle fire..once you get used to the controls you cant put it down
B00QW8TYWO|5|😊 this game is awesome sause. U should get it
B00JRCB3HQ|4|Good
B00BD99JMW|4|I was thrown off a bit by the change in writing style, but I like it. I like having more than just Tris's prospective. Good trilogy.
B00BAXFJ5M|5|Another great read! Ready for the next book. When does it come out? Seven more words needed now three more.
B00000JLWW|2|i agree with another user's comments about this dvd: i love the movie (for me it's one of the best movies of the last decade), but i think this dvd edition is really really bad... it's not only that it doesn't have any extras at all: to add pain to injury, the video it's not anamorphic but letterboxed, so if you've a widescreen tv you'll have to zoom in the picture, losing quality. of course it's better than a vhs, but that's not the point with this kind of film... it's one of the worst dvd editions i've ever seen, period. but the movie is so good that you'll forget about this details when you start to see it!
B00CATSONE|5|Very interesting i especially liked the beginning. Where the book contrasted IQ vs imagination, and effort. Short book can be read at lunch time.
B00B2V66VS|5|Temple Run 2 is 1 of the coolest games I have ever played!!!!!!!!!!<br />Imangi Studios should definitely keep working on this game and never stop updating it!!!
B003C1LGY8|5|Always enjoyed listening to Alice in Chains. Facelift, Dirt, Jar of Flies. Dirt is one of my favorite metal albums.<br /><br />I believe this dvd contains all of their videos up until Layne Staley's passing. Personally I like Man in the Box, Again, No Excuses, & The Rooster.. \\"Again\\" is one of my favorite songs from the band.. whenever I listen to it, the volume goes up to 11. All the videos are there with the obvious exception of their latest releases.. Straight-forward, video compilation is what your getting.. Well worth the money.<br /><br />I've had the dvd for over a year. Cannot remember what I paid, (10 bucks maybe), but well worth it. I know I could just watch them on You Tube but the quality is sooo much better on disc.<br /><br />Sidenote: Enjoyed several songs (and videos) from their last album: \\"Black Gives Way to Blue (2009)\\".. Lesson Learned, Your Decision, Check My Brain to name a few. Hope the band keeps writing and releasing music and videos. They still sound great!
B0066W1AZK|5|Its been a long time since last played. Going to take a while to get my play back. I would recommend this app to anyone be it a beginner or experienced player.  Big John
B000JMKNZQ|5|Here is a book full of small bite sized bits of wisdom. Chew on them when you need to and you may be surprised at how well they can sustain you.
B00AIUUXHC|4|Another game to pass the time. It is very easy to understand and a great time waster! I usually delete within a week to keep my mind fresh
B008F9E306|3|When I first heard \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\" a while back I eagerly awaited yet another T.I. album. I've loved all his stuff, being a fan since I first heard \\"Trap Muzik\\" and then all the way through \\"Paper Trail\\" which although I enjoyed, was definitely more of a step towards pop music. And Trouble Man continues that trend in my opinion.<br /><br />Thats not to say there isnt some good music here, and you still get some of the old T.I we all knew on songs like \\"G Season\\" I really dig the Introduction as well. But I can't say I'm really feeling the songs with R. Kelley, Pink, and Lil Wayne. Too much pop for my taste. Plus the album just didnt quite have the energy I've come to expect from T.I. A lot of the songs are just kind of mellow.<br /><br />Not terrible overall, I'll still remain a T.I. fan! This album's probably still worth picking up, especially if you liked Paper Trail
B000000WG4|3|I challenge anyone to sit alone in your house, turn off the lights, and listen to the opening five minutes of Tubular Bells. If you survive that, then, uh, you're pretty brave. I've heard this was used as background music  for an exhibit at the Boston Museum of Science. I can't imagine listening  to this while pondering some rotating balls or something. I'd be looking  over my shoulder, expecting to see some grinning weirdo ducking around a  corner. Or maybe something CRAWLING around the corner. Never mind. Buy this  one for the kaleidoscopic first half. I love the way Oldfield paints with  his guitar, instead of strangling it in the usual rock fashion. The second  half is the same broth, but with half the meat.
B006LSZECO|4|I thouroughly enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing the whole way through. Just when you think you have the plot figured out...no, you're wrong. I had a hard time putting it down. Even when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I thought the ending was strange. Maybe it fit the story, but still didn't seem right.
B00005QZWI|5|I am amazed that Howard Shore could just create a masterpiece such as this! The FOTR soundtrack is a wonderful introduction to all 3 soundtacks! Enya has a beautiful, enchanting voice! This is a good buy if you love the Lord of the Rings and Howard Shore! Happy Listening!
B000OPPBEQ|5|In my opinion, this movie franchise set the standard for sci-fi and action movies. The concept is acceptable, the acting is tight, the direction is spot on and the technical production values exceed expectations of this film's genre.
0307454568|2|Having read the first two books and also having seen the first two films, I wanted to read the third book in the series.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I just couldn't get through it. I almost put it down after about 150 pages, but tried to persevere. After about half way, (Roughly 300 pgs) I finally gave up.<br /><br />It just didn't keep my attention and my mind kept wandering. It just seemed boring, too wordy, too all over the place.<br /><br />Not being able to finish it, I watched the film instead. Quite frankly, I found that boring as well and fell asleep. I guess the third one in the trilogy just didn't do it for me. The first one was the best.
B00DFFHUUA|5|Good action show.
B00F88GRSS|4|Very good acting. It held my interest throughout.
B00000DHRX|5|I have been a fan of George Michael's since &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot;.  Since then, I have grown up, and so has George's music.  He has never given his fans anything less than perfect pop music.  He is one  of the few artists whose new albums (alas, with George, they are too few  and far between) I will buy without hearing a single song.<br />For the  uninitiated, &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentleman&quot; provides a great  introduction to Michael's music.  I disagree with those who call Disc 1  tiresome--I love &quot;Father Figure&quot;, &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;,  &quot;A Different Corner&quot; and (especially) &quot;Cowboys and  Angels&quot;.  Disc 2 is lots of fun--I dare you not to dance when it's on!   One day a co-worker and I cranked up this disc when no one else was in the  office...I've never had such fun at work.  (I paid the extra cash for the  import version, which is worth every penny for the wonderful &quot;As&quot;  duet with Mary J. Blige.  It's a pity this was taken off the U.S.  version.)<br />The album provides a good overview of &quot;Faith&quot;,  &quot;Listen Without Prejudice&quot; (a highly underrated work), and  &quot;Older&quot;.  Hopefully listeners of &quot;Ladies &amp;  Gentleman&quot; will be inspired to pick up some (or all) of these  albums.<br />Everyone I know that has or has listened to this album loves it.   George, you still have a lot of true fans over here in America.  Please  come back and see us sometime!
B004XQYBA2|5|you can choose the level that's right for you. If I'm in the middle of a game and have to leave it for some reason, I can just pause it. I love that if I get stuck and just can't figure out why I can have it analyze it and show the wrong digits. It has thousands of different games. the layout is great. If you love Sudoku I guarantee you will love this game!
B005MLOKXA|5|Great show very well writen.
B00FN5Z8UY|5|Other then the delay in shipping (very popular item), great price and love the Walking Dead.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I play it all the time,  I get a little frustrated, but I stick to it as it makes me think of each move I am going to do next.
B00FAPF5U0|3|Definitely a racket. You can play and win without buying boosters. Be patient and try to enjoy it. Spending your money won't make it much easier or more fun.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|Perfect! Best game ever! I want more!<br />1234567... and now 8! Gameloft makes perfect, terrific, amazing, games!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Could not be better! Gameloft should be a Gunissie<br />World Record!!!
B00C8S9W0G|5|I have no idea if there are more books to come. But as a person that just read all 8 books back to back in the course of 8 months, this seems like a very nice way to end the series. I loved all the books and this was a perfect way to see the end of the VERY long story. An amazing series.
B001KVZ6G6|5|As the name implied, the story goes up from the moment it begins, well crafted, beautiful scenery, characters fully develop, almost perfect. In Blue-Ray, it is divine, everything is sharp, well defined, sound is top notch, maybe too good. As for the story, it can be sum up in three words, circle of life. An aging man who lost his wife of so many years, is now on a journey of completing his wife life long dream, but in the process, it becomes his journey as well. Helping a small child, bird and dog, he recharged his life to start all over again. Highest possible recommendation, it's one of Pixar/Disney best movies in the last couple of years, pick it up and enjoy it.
B001EN71CW|5|When people ask about my favorite TV shows this is always my first mention. Firefly succeeds on so may levels that it is hard to define why it's great. I believe much of it has to do with the fact that the entire cast has talked about how much they loved doing this show together and it really shows.        Firefly was a true ensemble piece that was driven by amazing characters and brilliant writing. They were characters, and settings that almost felt familiar but were unique enough to make you pay attention. It was Sci-fi for everyone not just \\"geeks\\" and \\"nerds\\". It was Sci-fi about people trying to survive and stay together, humans with flaws and potential and baggage trying to leave their past and work together to survive in a universe they don't quite fit into. No aliens, no time travel, just people, and still a deal of action.         Most people know the story of how Fox TV screwed with this show in every way possible before finding an excuse to cancel it, and for this and other reasons Fox has vilified itself to a great many people. Despite Fox's shortsightedness Firefly has a fan base that is still growing as new people discover it. In just 14 episodes Firefly managed to do what most shows will never do, grab you and never let go. The true reason to mourn it's loss is potential. You have to wonder if in just 14 episodes it could be this great what could have happened if it had built a mythology and its character's had followed their natural growth.        Their are groups still trying to get it back on the air or even a sequel to it's big screen finale \\"Serenity\\" made but sadly this will probably never happen but if anyone out there in the verse can ask Joss Whedon one thing, just one favor, ask him to at least let the universe be continued in novels, it has great potential to be a hit in the literary world especially since Firefly and Serenity's demographic is definitely one that reads.        Stay Shiny
B0032UYFA6|5|This show is amazing. The acting is incredible and the story gets better and better.  Watched all 4 seasons in 2 weeks:)
B000HKW7E0|5|Best christmas ever!
B003M6FGTE|5|IT proves that we are all in this together. Great for ages 12-100.  Not as many complicated situations as later seasons.
B00CBRADU2|4|Great entertainment with a pretty weak plot. If you don't insist on a plot being logical and dialogue with deeper meaning and if you love action and Arnold - this movie is for you. I just sat back and enjoyed and that gives it 4 stars.
B0056CUZRA|1|From someone who has written a number of books that I have enjoyed this tale read as though written by a novice with no idea of grammar and a trite predictable plot. If you like clunky text and obvious outcomes then this is for you. Otherwise, save your money.
0345803493|1|It was a mistake for me to order this book.  People had  raved about it; so, I bought it for curiosity.  It was not my kind of book.  I read a little  of it, then dumped it in the trash.
B002NZK5TG|5|I have a weak spot for musicals.  Sure, they're often campy and over-the-top, but they're fun and often come with the bonus of great (or at least catchy) songs.  That's one of the main reasons I like so many of the classic Disney films, and am sort of disappointed that their later films seem to be veering away from the musical format.  In fact, musicals in general seem to have fallen out of favor with the general public, and it's rare anymore to see a movie musical in theaters.  Luckily, most of the good musicals out there are already available in DVD format, so they can be still be enjoyed even if the musical is becoming a dying art form in Hollywood.<br /><br />\\"Little Shop of Horrors,\\" while not a classic, is still a fun camp musical, and this movie version is one of the better transitions of a musical from stage to screen, helped by a strong cast, good special effects, and a macabre sense of humor.<br /><br />Seymour is a shy and nerdy employee at a failing flower shop, chafing under the reign of his tyrannical boss and longing for his lovely but equally meek co-worker Audrey, who herself is trapped in a loveless relationship with a sadistic dentist.  When Seymour happens upon an unusual plant and brings it into the shop, business picks up and the shop becomes a success... but only Seymour knows the truth about the plant -- that it requires human blood to thrive.  Eventually the planet reveals that it's not only sentient, but sassy and every bit as domineering as his old boss.  When the plant begins demanding flesh instead of blood, at first it seems to be the solution to Seymour and Audrey's problems... but the planet has its own terrible agenda, and Seymour and Audrey may not live to warn the world about the threat it poses.<br /><br />The special effects in this movie have held up well over time, and while some might claim the plant looks too \\"puppety,\\" I find I prefer physical puppetry over CGI.  Somehow the puppet plant looks more realistic than CGI could have been, and it doesn't jar the viewer out of the story.  That and it's quite hilarious seeing the actors interact with the plant, treating it as just another actor instead of a special effect.<br /><br />The acting itself is pretty good, and helps carry the film.  Rick Moranis does a wonderful job of playing an awkward but lovable nerd as Seymour, and Ellen Greene is adorable as Audrey.  Steve Martin seems to be enjoying himself way too much as the evil dentist, his every move exaggerated and every line belted out with lip-smacking maliciousness.  Bill Murray has a memorable cameo as a masochist who finds his way into Martin's office, and the singing trio who plays the Greek Chorus in this film slips into the film from time to time as nurses, employees, and street kids, delivering their own humorous commentary.<br /><br />While the singing itself isn't exactly a masterpiece (Rick Moranis and Steve Martin sure try but aren't exactly the next Josh Groban, though Ellen Greene has quite a set of pipes on her), the songs themselves are incredibly catchy and full of dark humor.  Steve Martin and the plant get two of the best numbers of the film in \\"Dentist\\" and \\"Feed Me,\\" though the plant's other number, \\"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space,\\" is somewhat annoying in my opinion.  (Oddly enough, this number wasn't in the original musical and was added in for the movie -- coincidence?)<br /><br />Sadly, the version of the film I watched doesn't include the alternate ending -- a much darker ending was filmed but cut out and replaced when it bombed with test audiences.  I'm rather curious about how the original ending played out, and will have to look for another version of the film to see how it went.<br /><br />Dark, campy, and a ton of fun, this is a definite must-have for musical fans and fans of '50s-style schlock horror movies.  Especially good for fans of \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show,\\" with the added bonus that this one can be watched with kids in the room (though I'd use caution playing it for any kid under 8 or 9).e caution playing it for any kid under 8 or 9).
B00B7NPRY8|5|A gripping story, with a lot of unexpected political intrigue, in a profoundly well-conceived universe. I'd recommend to anyone, whether or not a sci-fi fan.
1572814748|5|The Universal Waite deck is my favorite of all the flavors of Rider-Waite Tarot Decks on the market. The original drawings have been re-colored by Mary Hanson-Roberts and they are beautiful to look at as well as inspiring to use for readings.<br /><br />This deck is smaller than a normal tarot deck but not as small as mini tarot card decks.  They measure ~3.5\\" x 2.25\\" in size.  They come in a heavy duty box with a lift off lid.  It measures ~3.5\\" x 2.75\\" x 1.5\\" in size.  The top comes off without much effort, so I keep the deck in a travel case that is used for soap.<br /><br />My only issue with this deck is that the language in the LWB is somewhat archaic, flowery and hard to follow at times.  It reminds me of Victorian English using terms like hoodwinked for blindfolded.  It is not really a problem since this deck is easy to read without any help.<br /><br />One more thing I was happy with about my deck is that the drawings are very fine with more detail visible on this deck than on my Albino-Waite deck which uses the same line work; and this deck is smaller.<br /><br />This deck I would recommend if you want a deck of tarot cards to travel with or carry with you. I am very glad I bought this deck.

B000DWMYQ8|3|Dinsey needs to come up with better films like Beuty and the beast, Aladian, Lion King becouse in the direction it's going it's going down hill. I have to say the movie did not suck and it was not bad but it wasent really good. The movie aims more at he young audience which movies cant really do now becouse adults enjoy animated films more then kids for example Shrek 1 and 2, Incrediables, Finding Nemo and more too name. The film's story is ok it's like the classic story but thsi time it shows what happend next. The animation is cute and the whole time you watch it your thinking ah cute or the animation is good but what's the story. There is not much of a story to this film and it's very short as soon as I got into it it was over. Overall it's an enjoyable film for kids but adults may get board with it but it's fun to watch for the animation and the odd funny moments.
B006ZOGM2A|5|Got from our great &#34;cousins&#34; in the UK. On time as advertised

B00C7KYXHW|5|A new and exciting series for a great change of pace. I really enjoyed the pilot and the next 2 episodes (I am just now getting started on the series). I would highly recommend it!
B00HOGGUZW|5|Very fun to play and great, challenging puzzles.  It is highly addictive - I only went to try it out and was hooked for hours.

1449389627|5|I have read some of Scott's other writing and know he usually has a worthwhile point of view. I was not disappointed. He does a great job of demystifying the aura of fate/luck/accident/karma our culture gives to innovation. He has a clear and compelling call to action to \\"just do it\\". It is packed with good information and good advice. He verges on cynicism without being negative. It can serve as a useful kick in the rear to get you going again.
B00PMRRTS2|3|Very informative of Alzheimer's disease and the slow progressive affects it has to change the life of the patient and their love ones
B00KNWYDU8|5|I absolutely love Dragon City almost my whole family has it! The kids are always asking me, &amp;#34;mom can we please play Dragon City? &amp;#34; 5 stars for sure!!!!
B003B02O14|5|Wow! Master class from Sir Grisham. Great reading, no words left to describe about how the author revealed details at the right time and with a fine twist at the end. Just master class.
B001AQT0RC|5|good story
B00CW6DAKC|3|I enjoy this game, but some items require way too much RC to get. I play for fun. Not spending real money on a free game.
074401493X|5|This guide is absolutely amazing ha everything u need to know about the game! Definitely worth the buy! Also brings an awesome key chain that I haven't taken off my keys !!!!!
B00005JMJ4|5|A lot of films have an elaborate, complex storyline where not much really happens.  This film has a seemingly simple plot where a great deal happens.  Put simply, it's a funny, sweet and endearing film which is beautifully directed.  I can't really understand why so many people found this boring.  This is one of the few films I've found truly enthralling.  One quote which stays with me is when Charlotte says &quot;Let's never come back here again... because it will never be this much fun&quot;.
0385523912|5|The stark reality of an oppressive regime that is stifling all economic activity.  Growth is negative.  They are the classic night shot photo of failure vs S Korea where the north is all dark and the south is all lit up at night.  These are the real tales of the consequences of the intersection of politics and economics.
B000ATQYT2|4|They took out one of the songs that I feel is critical to the plot. Other than that it was great. I just watch it with youtube handy to replace the missing piece.
B00J3AW23G|5|Addictive. Which is what I want in a game.
B00ANAC32U|5|I had bought one previously from an online seller and although it looks the same as this one, did not fit the same. This item fit my phone perfectly, so much that some people think that it is part of the phone.<br /><br />Great product!
B00062IVKI|5|really enjoy the dvd as something different.  recommend it for everyone to see at least once.  well done, interesting to see the stars in such a different piece
1401322786|3|This book was a bit strange at first, but I liked the ending.  I guess that I expected it to be more like &#34;Tuesdays with Maury&#34;
0670026603|5|At 26 years old, Louisa Clark is a friendly, sensible, ordinary girl with a flair for unconventional fashion and a desire for something more. She is still living at home, plodding through a dull relationship when she unexpectedly finds herself unemployed. With few skills, fewer job opportunities and her family's desperate need for her financial contribution, Lou reluctantly interviews for a position as a well paid day time care giver for a quadriplegic man.<br /><br />Will Traynor is a wealthy 35 year old man on top of the world until a freak accident leaves him with severe spinal injury. This once independent, active man is now humiliated and embittered to be dependent on others for his most basic of needs. Will struggles with continuing to just exist when he can no longer participate in life the way he so desires. He has decided a plan for himself but what he doesn't anticipate is the girl hired to keep him company giving him a reason to love. Lou bursts into Will's life and forever leaves everyone involved changed.<br /><br />I LOVED this page turner of a story. It completely caught me off guard. There were moments I laughed out loud and times where I wept relentlessly. Me Before You has an entertainingly dysfunctional ensemble cast that reminds us love can be difficult and complex, but we are always better because of it. This story made me remember the old saying, \\"Never judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes\\". It is a wise story of love that captured heart and left me feeling powerfully moved.  - Wendy
145162607X|1|This book is extremely similar to The Virgin Widow by Anne O'Brien which was published two years prior to The Kingmakers Daughter.  Having read The Virgin Widow, I was able to predict every move in this book.  I expected more from Phillipe Gregory.  Very dissapointing.
0307341577|4|Dark Places by Gillian Flynn revolves around the violent massacre at a Kansas farm house and the fallout from that horrific event as exhibited twenty years later in the lives of those involved. Libby Day is the sole survivor, and is a compelling picture of entitlement and brokenness, as if she has earned people’s pity and grief, but she’s far from weak. When Libby turns to exploiting her minor celebrity for money, she manages to get pulled into a strange subculture obsessed with her family’s killing, and is subsequently recruited to investigate certain things that cast doubt on the testimony she gave as a child which placed guilt on her own brother. With chapters alternating between the present day and the hours leading up to the massacre, Flynn’s pacing is perfection. Her prose shines a little less brightly here, but it still has a freshness and zip to it. Flynn provides some sly comments on our culture’s obsession with macabre cases such as the mass killing of a family, as well as some devastating insights into how something that awful infects everyone it touches. The narrative will keep you interested and off balance—never quite knowing who’s lying, who’s telling the truth, and what really happened in that farmhouse on that cold January night.
B00004RF97|5|The Philadelphia Story is one of my all time favorites.  The casting of the 3 leads is wonderful.The role of Tracy Lord was tailor-made for Katharine Hepburn.  She plays the part with the perfect balance of haughty arrogance and vulnerability.  Cary Grant is snappy and sexy andJames Stewart is charming and loveable.  This has been remade several times but has never been improved upon.

The songs are terrific, and the detail in the movie is great (even the clouds move!) Keep up the good work, disney, and I'm hoping to see a Lion Ling 3 soon!!!
B00IX9UTLU|5|Very good story, both characters have a very attractive profile. A little similar to FSG, yet the story behing each character is what I like about this book.
B00J3AW23G|3|Played with it for a few days but ended up removing it from my phone. Very nostalgic, reminded me of an old PC version I played in secondary school but didn't capture my attention for the long haul.
B002W6Z0UK|4|I like the Lady. She has a beautiful voice and her avant garde style is rather appealing. Still, there is nothing new or innovative here. I immediately sensed that I'd heard it all before whether it was the delivery, the beat, or the inflection. She is very reminiscent of a young Madonna and even the nasal quality of her voice evokes comparison. Alejandro could be packaged as La Isla Bonita Part II. It's not altogether a bad thing and I imagine GaGa is well aware of it. With that said, I enjoy The Fame Monster tremendously and play it often. The formula may be 25 years old but it's still a winning one.

B0038AUY96|1|Some reviews suggested that it was as good or better than 'the millennium' trilogy which i thought was fabulous, so i picked it up<br />Though it started like a stephen king novel, it showed some potential in the first few chapters, and then the first few chapters never ended,<br />they repeated themselves until a fourth of the book was done.<br /><br />I considered dropping the book several times, but out of habit, finished it anyway. I;m sure there are better books out there.<br /><br />Very boring indeed. Not even close to a Steig Larsson book!
B00COGXGNQ|5|Love Julianne Hough and Josh Dummel!!! I watched this movie in theaters and bought the album and I rented it on Amazon to watch with my good friend and it was awesome watching a second time and my friend loved it! Thinking about buying it!
B00DR0PDNE|5|I have a blue ray in the living room that allows us to stream Netflix and other video apps but I didn't want to buy a blue ray for every room. Well this is the best solution for that. I can stream netflix, youtube and my movies off of vudu on this very inexpensive device plus I can move it from room to room if I want to. I love it and it's easy to use.
B000286S8S|2|I have been fortunate enough to obtain numerous live bootlegs of VH from the early years and can compare them to the post 1984 era.  All I can say is that this band was probably the best in the World.  Perhaps they should re-name this album 'Best in the World until 1984'?  DLR was 50% of VH's persona, no doubts.  I have listened and watched all their Hagar material, and as far as cliche rock goes, one era was influenced by a genious and the next era was influenced by a has-been.  I have also watched the DVD 'VH the early days' and in my mind it demonstrates how the band relied on DLR for their stardom.  This compilation is alright, but there are a hell of alot of raw VH missing.  I thought they would have included more from 'Van Halen 2' and Women and Children First'.  Seeing as Eddie is free again and DLR is doing nothing, maybe it's time for a proper reunion so that the old VH magic can be rekindled, because it ain't too late!  I say this because the Hagar tracks on this comp are as limp as f***!
0316010669|4|Always inciteful there is still no quick fix for expertise.  Just that once you have earned it you can evaluate in the blink of an eye.  Also, that the non expert is more likely to judge well in short exposure with limited information rather than with longer exposure and additional information.
B000007U4U|5|This is the first of two by this incredible band that plays some great and indulgent 70's progressive rock, but without any pomposity. The music is much more jazz influenced (using keyboards, guitar) than other prog bands,  and it has a beautiful wistful quality that isn't often heard...<br /><br />The CD  also contains the two bonus tracks: the A&B sides of their 45. Even the  cover art is beautiful.<br /><br />If you long ago outgrew bands like  \\"Yes,\\" \\"ELP,\\" and \\"Genesis,\\" and have crossed  over to jazz but secretly still like progressive rock, then by all means  give \\"Hatfield & the North\\" a try - for my money, they remain  one of the greatest bands of all time...and that is something I don't  espouse lightly...
B00IUBXPEY|5|GREAT MOVIE
B00CO52NLI|3|Some reason i can never be able to return the birds or hamster food and cleaning away even if i try to put them at the exact place very annoying. Other than that it's fun but i cant even play even if i want to without putting them away.
B005LAIHY0|1|The problems of Prometheus begin with Ridley Scott's unparalleled ride as one of the finest filmmakers on the planet. It's extremely rare when he makes a bad film. Not that Prometheus is a bad film...per se...but definitely a disappointment...okay, it was bad. Even A Good Year wasn't...well, all that bad. It had the frivolous charm of a thin Provence rosé. Amusing. Light. As it was meant to be and a divertissement for Ridley who no doubt needed a sillier romp after such darker, more intense and bloody films as Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of Heaven or Body of Lies. So, I, like many were looking for Scott's return to space (the final frontier), the future and figuring out how that metallic-looking, elongated, insect-looking, acid-salivating alien, Alien, got to be such an adorable, durable boffo star of the silver screen.<br /><br />Prometheus begins with a bald, rather sun-starved, eyebrow-ridged, hulky future prospect for the Cincinnati Bengals (they could use a lot of these guys) standing in the shadow of a disc shaped flying saucer hovering over a presumably primordial waterfall where bounced-around molecules in the churning waves below have not been able to cluster into the self-replicating RNA or DNA molecules, the necessary building blocks of life.<br /><br />Never mind that just before we closed in on this seminal moment, that the camera (or virtual CGI camera) passed over a hillside that looked suspiciously green - perhaps from some sort of plant with some sort of very ruggedized RNA strands or non-DNA but remarkably similar DNA-like agent that helped the green planty life replicate itself hither and thither over said hillside. Hmm.<br /><br />No, no...there is no DNA (or even RNA) at this stage in Earth's younger days. Forget the hillside. The brutish muscled-bound alien will open some sort of urn, drink its contents and disintegrate before our eyes so his \\"human-like\\" DNA will mingle and mate with heretofore random socially inept molecules, nucleotides and proteins that have been haplessly bumping into, but unable to get stuck on, one another. This alien future nose tackle will kindly give us our much needed sticky self-replicating molecule as his gift so that all life on Earth could begin -- and stunningly hundreds of millions of years later, the DNA for humans will match identically with the DNA of the aforementioned aliens. WHAT?!!<br /><br />Okay, the mathematical improbabilities and the complete dismissal of genetic evolutionary processes over hundreds of millions of years aside, it was awfully nice of the big fella. On behalf of my fellow humans, thanks ya big pasty-faced lug, ya!<br /><br />The obvious parallel to Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrik's 2001: A Space Odyssey is evident even though Clarke/Kubrik's unseen aliens in their story really only gave our early primate ancestors a telepathic evolutionary nudge to become more intelligent and hone their survivalist skills by thumping rivals and other critters over their noggins with large bones that instantly changed into orbiting satellites. And despite that radical jump cut, 2001 still plodded along unmercifully as though prehistory and the modern age had not been left on the editing room floor at all.<br /><br />Scott's Prometheus one-ups 2001 by going back even further than the Dawn of Man (or even the Dawn of Woman...chicken...egg...chicken...egg) to the Dawn of Life (sounds like a dishwashing soap, doesn't it?) to suggest that all life, even green leafy life on hillsides, are courtesy of big-boned, presumably non-primate derived ancestors reverently referred to in the film as \\"The Engineers\\".<br /><br />Prometheus attempts even more profundity, when Dr. (of some scientific discipline) Elizabeth Shaw asks in response to a rare on-board skeptic not fully on-board with this non-evolutionary theory being taken as gospel, \\"Yes but who made them?\\" The `them' of course being The Engineers. My mind was reeling. No, really. Of course, it could have been a reaction to my $100, 25-gallon drum of cherry-vanilla spiked Coke Zero and the large case of Milk Duds that reclined in the seats on either side of me in the empty theater. I think they may have enjoyed the film more than I did. They're gone now.<br /><br />Where was I? Oh, yes...in the film, newly discovered cave paintings along with Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphics and an animation cell from The Flintstones  serve as the catalyst to this epic Riddlyian quest. Two scientists, and I use that term loosely, via a little metallic Rubik's cube project holograms to a witless Prometheus crew (that would be the crew of the starship Prometheus not necessarily the crew of the film) to explain why they've signed up for this fiasco.<br /><br />The holograms superimpose themselves on one another to startlingly reveal that all the ancient images are telling the cast and theatergoers the same thing -- that we could have gotten this same poppycock by watching Ancient Aliens on the History Channel and that we were all made by slender NBA super-sized aliens not the beefier NFL-looking brute seen earlier. One must assume that later in prehistory Engineers who have held their corporeal selves together palled around with our primitive ancestors but must have been dieting because of some proto-Bloombergian tyrant's edict about transfats, salts and sugars.<br /><br />Apparently this amazing discovery, not repeated episodes of Ancient Aliens or Stargate, was enough to convince a dying, wrinkly trillionaire Peter Weyland (who is not necessarily Richard Branson) to spend a trillion dollars or so (chump change in Obama's America, so a pittance really in the year 2089) for a two-year voyage (and that's pretty quick really) across the expanse of intergalactic space to meet The Engineers and to ask them about the secret of eternal life. (Was there even a science advisor on this film? If so, did he change his name on the credits?)<br /><br />Here's a nit, though. Why spend so much time making otherwise scrawny, sunken-cheeked Aussie actor Guy Pearce into a heavier, wrinkled nonagenarian Peter Weyland if we haven't seen his more youthful countenance earlier in the film? Why not just cast a heavier, wrinkled nonagenarian? Helen Thomas was available, wasn't she? I hear she's got quite the range. Casting Thomas might have better explained Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers' frosty, sullen...let's face it, bitchy behavior a lot better than the revelation that for some elusive reason, she is the estranged daughter of that more likeable older guy...uh, Guy.<br /><br />Another nit...while I'm at it. I personally have a problem with certain movie references in other movies. It seems to me that some movies should almost exist in a universe of their own making. Scott's Blade Runner is such a movie. In Prometheus, Michael Fassbinder's David- superbly acted by the way, is referred to as a replicant, a term, popularized in Blade Runner. Essentially, Scott's not so subtle nod to his earlier work and himself, almost as if to say, \\"Remember me? I'm the bloke that made Blade Runner. I loved that word replicant so much, I decided to use it again in Prometheus. You noticed it, didn't you?\\"<br /><br />By the way, for all the pre-movie hype about Prometheus not necessarily being a prequel to Scott's amazingly directed and edited moody taught thriller, Alien; it is after all the swirling and silicon debris dust clouds settle...the, uh...prequel to Alien. Not that that's a bad thing, because as a prequel, Prometheus is a tad more coherent than anything more cosmologically complex it attempts to explain.<br /><br />Visual, action and character references to Alien also abound. The character of David not only is a prequel prototype of Ash, Ian Holm's unfeeling, smug and snarky robot (not replicant) who was just one consonant away being a real as_ but both are decapitated and continue to speak after decapitation...because they have really good agents.<br /><br />After Prometheus lands on the planet where The Engineers have beckoned them across space and time and space-time, in no time at all the crew is happily gallivanting like giddy schoolchildren into what appears as an abandoned dome-shaped building with curved arms much like Bernini's curved colonnade around Vatican square but that we all know is the alien spacecraft we saw a few decades ago in Alien. Please gasp here.<br /><br />I'll spare you the ponderous details over much of the preposterous narrative suffice to say that David, the soulless, seemingly amoral replicant finds some organic goo and a little black ladybug-like nub that he later not so amorally and deviously drops into Logan Marshall-Green's martini so the hyphenated actor would become infected and be used as a host for some sort of nasty, alien life form because that's what actors do to other actors so they can have larger roles. Happens all the time.<br /><br />Marshall-Green's Charlie Holloway who is a doctor of some scientific discipline and love interest of the aforementioned Dr. (of some scientific discipline) Elizabeth Shaw, proceeds to make love to Dr. Shaw instantly impregnating her with the alien life form which gestates faster than you can say, \\"That was some spicy meatball.\\" Once she is informed that she's with tentacle-tucked alien life form and amazingly the equivalent of three months along, Dr. Shaw assertively makes her way to an automated, self-contained Mr. Operation machine where she punches a few buttons and has the offending alien fetus extracted and later killed while she has her abdomen stapled up. She is a doctor, after all.<br /><br />See how convenient the future is? DIY births and abortions. Take your pick, even if you use a Mr. Operation for Men. I had the nagging feeling that there was some sort of underlying message about unwanted pregnancies and a woman's right to choose...not that tentacled alien life forms are what nature or the Creator may have intended no matter how adorable and clingy they might turn out to be.<br /><br />Convinced that the newborn squid-thingy is dead Dr. Shaw seals up the operating room to find out if anyone on board the Prometheus is up for a little backgammon but is not terribly surprised to find that the old geezer, Weyland has come along for this two-year star trek. But you know and I know and Sigourney Weaver (who's not in this film at all) knows that the icky-many-rubbery-legged-thingy left in the O.R. ain't dead because we've seen Alien and Fatal Attraction and the career of Pauly Shore--and we all know that Mr. Squid is going to get bigger and nastier and more tentaclier and jump out in a very predictable and anti-climactic sort of way.<br /><br />Meanwhile back inside the Alien craft structure, two doltish, goofball, comic relief scientists who can't seem to find their way out of the film fast enough, Fifield and Milburn find themselves in a worm-infested, muddy, soppy alien nursery suddenly being observed by a nasty, slithery, hissing cobra-like creature. Milburn, the biologist in the party, attempts to play with and fawningly coo to the alien cobra because he apparently mistakes the obviously threatening and hissing reptile for a golden retriever puppy. He and his Scottish geologist sidekick (who is perpetually angry - those Scots - at having signed up for such an awful assignment...one supposes the mission...not necessarily the film...but then again...) are gruesomely rewarded for Millburn's stupidity which, for the theater audience, comes as no surprise and actually a good deal of relief, since they were both more annoying than humorous and deserved to die a lot sooner. Three cheers for alien cobra creature!<br /><br />Much mayhem soon ensues and I'll skip a whole lot of the not-terribly suspenseful action and the tedious ending, suffice to say that Dr. Shaw's refrain of \\"We were SO wrong!\\" begged SO many comments and questions, like, \\"We were SO wrong about the science in this script!\\" Like how is it exactly that humans can evolve miraculously from alien DNA hundreds of millions of years ago, with all the random environmental factors that affected life on earth over time including pandemic viruses, being eaten as prey, oh and the occasional Earth-colliding asteroid that destroyed most of the life on the planet - AND STILL BE AN IDENTICAL DNA MATCH WITH OTHERWORLDLY ALIENS?!!! Let's take a closer look at that alien DNA and see if it includes the chromosomal fusion evident in humans that indicates that humans and chimpanzees and bonobos have a common genetically-linked primate ancestor. (If you feel like challenging me on that last point, please take it up with biologist Ken Miller, he's the expert on this.)<br /><br />I know, I know. It's a movie. It's only a movie. How could I have been SO wrong to expect something better from Ridley Scott? Perhaps little things have big beginnings to paraphrase the replicant and Lawrence of Arabia - now that was a film!<br /><br />But the special effects were cool.

B00AREIAI8|5|This is the best game ever!It's so fun. If you are a horse lover,then this game is for you! I have tried other games and they stink! Do try it,it's so fun. Plus free,but there is in app purchasing.
B00846F1YW|4|Bought for and downloaded to a Kindle Fire original - no glitches, worked well.  Also need to say that I bought both of these when they were on sale.  These are not difficult to do - but they're fun!! and if you're a newbie to these types of games - these are great to start with.  The story line is hokey as all get out - plus it's written in this sort of broken English? - but it adds to the overall fun.  Of course it could be just my own off the wall brain that found this a hoot and a half - but hey, theres bound to be a few more eccentric oldies out there like me.
B00003CXDZ|1|What amazes me most about this film was that it did so much right. <br />Was it visually stunning? Indeed.<br />Was the acting good? It was great. I didn't believe Nicole Kidman could give such a performance. I still think a stunt-double must have done the acting parts for her.<br />Unfortunately, no amount of polish can make up for the fact that the framework of this film is rotten. The story is completely uninspired. And the songs, well... let's just say I was expecting to hear the cast break out into a Boz Scaggs tune at any time (that's NOT a compliment).<br />It amazes me that anyone could find this film enjoyable, and that is not sarcasm.
B0054JZC6E|5|I love it but even though it looks easy its not. some of the games are very challenging.  its fun though
0446310786|4|Harper Lee's to Kill A Mockinbird is a wonderful book. The characters are well portrayed, and the setting is described in a very intreging way. Harper Lee sets the story in a small town like the one she grew up in and this helps us relate more the characters and what is going on in the story. She also creates a significance in the story from the setting by relating it to something we have all seen or heard of. The novel has a very interesting plot that ingulps you into it the second you start reading the book. The meaning of the book is very significant in itself. Harper Lee uses a lot of metaphors in this story but one can always understand what she means by these metaphorical phrases. With this book Harper Lee has portrayed examples of our historical past. This novel is one of the best of all times and you will not just read it once but rather over and over again.
B00LP9EE1G|4|pretty good
B0002XVQNU|4|My first impression of Daredevil in the theater was that of a confused, poorly edited yet energetic and moody look at the Daredevil character. I didn't like it much but I have liked the character since I was a kid and enjoyed enough of it to avoid  seeing the whole experience in a poor light.<br /><br />The director's cut of the film fixed a good 50% of the problems I had with the theatrical release. There is around 30 minutes of extra footage involving a subplot that showcases the character of Matt Murdock. This cut also retells the relationship between Elektra and Daredevil and makes it a lot more involving and a lot less gratuitous. The action scenes are extended and more violent and there are even a few more snipets of things you may have missed in the theatrical cut as a fan of the character (like Matt's mom).<br /><br />I still won't give it a perfect score as the scenes that didn't work for me still don't but the director's cut moves the film from an average yet faulty attempt to a legitimate vision of the character.
B0070Y46UY|4|I chose 4 stars for this book instead of 5 because the first half of the book is slow and quite boring.
0399160450|5|Another great read by Clancy
1439127700|2|The Kindle version is $4 more than the paperback version, which should never be the case. The Kindle version should always be cheaper than any new copy of a paperback, and the only way this will happen is for people (like me) to vote with their wallets. I want to read this book, but will seek it out at the library rather than overpay for the Kindle version.
B00ILHW6AG|4|IMO, classic King...a little freaky, a little sappy, and a good read.  Couldn't wait to see what the future held for the characters.
B000002H6C|5|After the death of bassist Cliff Burton, Metallica releases an album that retains their classic thrash-headbanger style but with longer and more technical songs full of message and emotion that ties &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; as their best album. The songs are darker, heavier, longer, and the lyrics focus more on dying than killing. I've heard it said that the procuction is bad and that the drums sound bad, but I totally disagree. In fact, these are the best-sounding drum tracks I've ever heard. Also, LONG SONGS ARE AWESOME!<BR>The album starts with the coolest introduction to any CD I've ever heard. &quot;Blackened&quot; is a fast song with environmentally-oriented lyrics (I think). The next song, &quot;And Justice for All,&quot; targets corruption in justice. It's slower and kind of keeps on jamming forever. &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; crunches out as one of Metallica's best. &quot;ONE&quot; IS THE GREATEST SONG EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Exploring the feelings of a wounded soldier who longs for death, this song is so perfectly written it cannot be described in words. It has the best melodic riff and the song changes into a double-bass drum thrash at about 4:30, and then the guitar joins. If you don't know what I'm talking about buy the CD and listen to it at the highest volume possible. The video for this song is by far the most powerful music video ever-if you don't get chills, check your pulse! They should have left a few minutes of silence after &quot;One&quot; so you can catch you're breath and kind of reflect back on the song in awe, but unfortunately they didn't. The next three songs are all as good as any (the introduction to &quot;The Frayed Ends of Sanity&quot; is pretty tight). &quot;To Live is to Die&quot; would be an incredible instumental by itself, but it isn't an instrumental because there are eight lines of spoken lyrics near the end. What makes this song even better is that the lyrics were written by the late Cliff Burton (he helped write the song itself too). The solos and drum fills inserted all over the place also help this song one of their best. The final song &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; has a cool title which has nothing to do with the lyrics, but it is the best song after &quot;One.&quot; If you're not chanting &quot;DEAR MOTHER, DEAR FATHER!&quot; by the end of the song, you're deaf. Fast, tight, and angry, it's impossible not to be impressed. What a great CD.

B005HED11Y|5|I watched this show with my 12 year old son. I got him hooked on the original series, and we have watched all the movies in chronological order. It's great to share something from your childhood with your children. I have watched the episodes a hundred times, but to watch one of them again, with someone who has never seen it before, is &#34;PRICELESS&#34;... I recommend the original TV series to everyone. Especially the re-mastered version. So sit back and watch these with your children. You will see them become fans and learn something in the process......

This is because egotistical people only care about the personal reward and not how their actions contribute to others.<br /><br />-The best leaders are WILLING and not bashful to fire their family members, because they only want the people that will be the best for the company.<br /><br />-The essential strategy in maintaining a great company is like being a bus driver. You must know how to select the best people and get them on the bus, but also how to get the wrong people off of the bus and replace them with someone who is a performer. People who are not right for the company are a sickness that will infect the top performers and restrict their growth. If everyone on the bus is absolutely right for the company and believes in what they are doing then the company will soar.<br /><br />-Short term thinking: having top performing employees taking slack of poor employees. Long term thinking: firing poor employees and replacing them with new and better performers. This saves money and allows more production and won't cause your top performers to get fatigued so they can blossom.<br /><br />-Good is the nemesis of Great. You should never settle for mediocrity or else the company will never be competitive and will fail to keep up with growing demands and trends. Mediocrity causes people to become lazy and to stop trying and forget what got them success in the first place. When they become complacent they will fail.<br /><br />-Great companies always hire outstanding people and will create positions around them. This is how they prepare for the future.<br /><br />-BAD companies live by the theory that key people should never hire anyone smarter than them because they want to remain secure in their position. The best companies hire the smartest and best and work together to build something great. They recognize that if they hire mediocre employees then the competition will beat their company anyway and their company will fail and they will be out of a job, so why not work with the best people and have the best company that causes other companies to fail? It is the difference between short term and long term thinking.<br /><br />-Hard workers don't stay with your company because of the money: they stay because they cannot settle for less. If you expect the best and set the standard of quality high for the company and the people working there, the best employees will want to work their instead, because of the experience working with the best people and also knowing that they are creating something that they can be proud of. I am sure the best companies still pay their employees well, but this argument is saying that the company doesn't have to worry about the employee leaving just because they got a higher offer at another company. This is how Zappos became great (If you read \\"Delivering Happiness\\" by Tony Hsieh): they actually offered to pay people to leave their company if they were considering joining another company that would pay more. NOW THAT is how you know you have the right people on your team: because they can see the potential in your brand rather than the temporary dollar signs.<br />-\\"When in doubt, don't hire--keep looking\\"<br /><br />-Never quit serving top quality, or customers will start noticing and then lose trust in your company. If you start \\"watering-down\\" your product in order to earn more revenue, you are are short-term thinker and will lose more in the long run.<br /><br />-Walgreens became one of the top USA companies solely because they used a model of creating tight clustersand building a branch close to another one. This is obvious with other franchises such as McDonald's: Even though I personally think that it is annoying to have the same store a few blocks away, the results are staggering.<br /><br />-The best teams are those where the members hold themselves accountable. If you have the best people, they won't settle for a poor performer to do shoddy work. The team polices itself and doesn't wait for a manager to intervene. They create their own punishment and expect the best from each other. They understand that the team is only as strong as its weakest member.<br /><br />I have had the line stick with me forever when Jim Collins' wife said that if she quit her job and dedicated herself fully to competing in triathlons that she would be the best in the world. He then goes on to say that if you are going to do anything then you might as well make sure that you are going to be the best at it--if not, then what is the point in trying and failing? This is a different take on the common phrase: \\"Go big or go home\\" but makes the statement a lot more concrete with a real-world example.<br /><br />I am not sure why I decided to read this book at the young age of 23. I knew that it would be a good book from the review online, but I didn't know that it would be so LIFE CHANGING and relate to me as a person and not just basic corporate mumbo-jumbo. I have yet to open my own business but this book is the main reason why I think that owning a business is the only way to go in America. I am proud that teachings such as this exist and I am grateful for Jim Collins in providing readers with such powerful and inspirational material.

B006TJXZ30|5|want to get right into your email from your Tablet. This app is it. It gets right into the hotmail screen without any problems. I really like it. I wish some things were just as easy.
B00VFTA70I|3|Great movie but I feel that the movie only focuses on the sexual orientation of the character more than the accomplishments that were achieved by the main character and the team.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Downton Abbey is the best TV show I have ever watched!  Keep up the great work!  It is so refreshing to be able to watch what I consider to be a &#34;wholesome&#34; show.
0312330529|5|Robert's novel, Shantaram, is an exceptional work. It will touch you deeply. This book sparked weeks worth of conversation in my home on subjects as diverse as herion withdraw, cultural diversity, \\"The wrong thing for the right reason,\\" and the strength of the human spirit. It is a must read and I highly recomend the title be first on your summer reading list.
B001J710Y8|5|Best pagan horror movie ever
B004Q7CIFI|5|One question...how do I access the video on my kindle fire?  As for a review...I loved this book.  It was detailed and expertly woven in a way I doubt anyone but King could do.  If you loved or even just LIKED his books you'll love this one.    I love that King finds a way to tie in other books that he's written like he's created a community you'd expect to find in your own real life.  I found two ties at least.  See if you can find them.  One will be very obvious if you're a fan and the other is subtle enough that you'll miss it if you're not looking for it.  A MUST READ'!!  :)

6305971099|2|Director:  Dominique Othenin-Girard<br />Cast:  Donald Pleasence, Ellie Cornell, Matthew Walker, Danielle Harris, Wendy Kaplan, Beau Starr, Tamara Glenn.<br />Running Time:  96 minutes<br />Rated R for violence, gore, language, and brief sexual situations.<br /><br />\\"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\\" begins just moments after the previous sequel departed, with the police looking for Myers after they shot him down the mineshaft. Myers escapes and is nursed back to health by an unlucky farmer. After a year, Jaime (Danielle Harris) is living at a children's hospital and is rendered mute by the previous year's ordeal. Occasionally, stepsister Rachel (Ellie Cornel) and her friend Tina (Wendy Caplan) visit, but as Halloween approaches, they get word of a party not far out of town. Tina's friend Samantha (Tamara Glynn) and their boyfriends, Michael (Jonathan Chapin) and Spitz (Mathew Walker), respectively, decide to join in. however, Jaime begins having day-mares that Myers is still alive, something Dr. Loomis knows too well. After Rachael has been killed, Loomis is convinced they are real, and he and Police Chief Meeker (Beau Starr) decide to play it safe and keep an eye on the party. After some practical jokes, Myers strikes, killing Samantha, Spitz, and nearly killing Tina, using a disguise borrowed from a newly killed Michael. Snapping out of her mute state, Jaime and Loomis attempt to bring Myers back to his old house for a last showdown.<br /><br />Horror veteran Pleasance, who has been in an inexhaustive list of horror films , is exceptionally eerie once again as Loomis. Throughout \\"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\\", Pleasance appears quite fatigued which adds weight to his portrayal of Loomis, a man who has suffered a lot. It is odd that anyone would let Loomis near a children's hospital, he is as obsessive and as freaky as Myers. The only person he can relate to is his former patient, his worldview narrowed(cf. the `mad' scientist of most horror). His relationship is quite paternal, note the softness (love) in his voice as he talks to Myers.  While Pleasence is solid in one of his final screen roles, the rest of the lackluster cast seems to be going through the motions.  The direction by Dominique Othenin-Girard is mediocre, bracing the audience with only moderately scary murder scenes and only a formidable climax.  What began as one of the most celebrated horror series has been sliced down to exactly what the horror genre became in the early to mid 1980's:  a chip off the old block that wasn't nearly as effective as its predecessors.paternal, note the softness (love) in his voice as he talks to Myers.

B000MNP2KI|5|Daniel Craig is truly the finest Bond to grace the screen, even counting the illustrious Connery and misunderstood Dalton-yes, Timothy was excellent!-into the mix.  His performance is most certainly Oscar worthy here.  Hopefully, the future will bring him his Best Actor Oscar.
0553805371|5|I have read few pages of this, but is amazing.    just one comment about the package, the cardboard is a little heavy, it adds almost 100 grams to the package, I think that it can be wrapped with something more flexible and less heavy    About the product I have no complains, it is great! :)
B000003N7Y|5|For whatever reason Mingus decides to revisit these tunes, all recorded earlier (Celia being the one new tune) and available elsewhere though under different titles, and does the definitive versions. This is Mingus without restraint and at the height of his arranging powers. Every song is better than the original version. Really. And that's the reason to own this collection. If ever someone questions Mingus' brilliance, play this album.

B008JGSM6G|5|I was just planning on playing for a few minutes, but it turned into an hour! if I were u I would get it. plus, its free! I would still pay 99&cent; if I had to:)
B00RGQ4674|5|Loved the book series. I have been reading the series since the books came out. My entire family has passed them around to be read and reread. The dvd set is beautifully done. I am impressed by how truly accurate everything is. No fluff at all. So real; you can almost smell the filth of the time. I pre ordered the next round, which I watched on tv. Quite gritty indeed. If you truly love the books and respect the writer, trust that the dvd series will match in quality. Not for the faint of heart.
B00G1TOJ7Y|5|One of the most beautifully written books I have read. Am on the third book by Anthony Doerr – a storyteller who makes every word count.

067003830X|5|This book contains all kinds of fascinating theoretical information about the human brain, and how it works and can change itself. But its greatest value for me lies in all the practical ideas it offers on how to learn and teach better. It also extends hope and motivation to anybody who is trying to recover from a loss of body function due to brain damage caused by illness or injury. We have so much more potential for self-healing than we realize, if only we go about it in the right way, and persist, against all odds.
B00GAVJ77K|5|So far so good! Nice to be protected for free ( •̀∀•́ )

B005IQZB14|4|Book is reading like a novel. Enjoying it so far. She isn't using the best of common sense, but then that is probably what made it a best seller and why it was chosen for a movie!
B00AB12TEI|4|A phenomenal guidebook that allows one to structurally understand one's strengths and weaknesses during plans for career change! There may be other books in this area, but this book's makes the process of self discovery quite easy.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Well...I was not expecting a boring title for the game to be sooo amazing!!!😀😀😀
B000068QY7|1|i absolutely love definitely maybe and morning glory.  be here now and standing on the shoulders of giants were ok.  but this album doesn't do it for me at all.  force of nature and hindu times are decent tracks, but even the best tracks on the album are only good to me because they are vestiges of what i love about listening to older oasis albums....maybe noel should start doing [something different] if it will help him and his band regarner some respect and most importantly, musical inspiration.
B000B8L6LI|5|I purchased this set in addition to a course and sapphire stones the system as a whole is great, especially for people who have the patience but not necessarily a guru handy to teach you the ancient arts of wet stone sharpening. Others on here can attest to just how sharp you can get even a cheap, dull knife with a little time and diligence.<br /><br />The point of my review is to highlight how superb Lansky's customer service is. I've had my stones for about a year now and recently noticed some of them had developed hairline cracks in the plastic where the screw tightens. Not a big deal, but one was starting to grow to the point where I could no longer tighten it all the way. I emailed Lansky, they said no prob; just send them in and they'd happily replace them. Well, I didn't mention it the first time but I'm in Canada, and the postage to send my set to NY was nearly the cost of replacing the stones. I mentioned this and asked if I could send photos instead. She said absolutely (I spoke with the same person through the entire process,) I emailed the photos right there and my new stones are on their way. Took less than a day for all those emails and she genuinely came across as pleased that they could make things right. For an item as affordable as this, one can't expect too much grief when something breaks, but they blew me away with their commitment (lifetime warranty) to their product. If my set wears again I will be happily buying a new one, just to support a good thing.

When I realized I wanted to borrow it from the library again, I decided to buy a copy of it for myself!  It is very easy to follow along with the instructions and really can get your creative juices going. I highly recommend it!
B002IYEQR4|5|truely excellent, i owned the game and that came with a blue ray copy of the movie but this has soo much more and im very very pleased. friends are jelouse when they come over
B004XJRQUQ|5|This would have to now be one of my favorite books ever. This book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster! I will refund defiantly have to read it again and again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|At first, i thought this was just a game where you're stuck in a room with a box, but this actually proved me wrong! U have to use ur brains to figure out the puzzles, and it's awesome!!! U really gotta try this out!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5|Great book... Riveting. The complexities of the characters and the suspense kept me obsessed with the story. Anybody who has an interest in political fiction, science fiction, apocalyptic fiction, realistic fiction... Any or all of the above, this is the book for you. I cannot wait to get into book two!
B00BE97ONM|4|This book kept my attention through out. It had it's surprise ending and well worth the read.  I think you will enjoy it too.
B00008PC2O|1|Being a huge Terminator fan, I was disappointed to buy this DVD and find out that many of the features such as the two other versions of the film (theatrical and special extended version) are only available on DVD ROM.  If you are playing this DVD in your \\"home\\" DVD player like I am, all you get is one version of the film - the \\"Special Edition\\" which includes 16 added minutes.  Some of those added 16 minutes are good, but some of it (Sarah's dream sequences with Kyle) were rightly cut in the first place.  I definitely think the theatrical version should be available for play on a \\"regular\\" DVD player, such as with the \\"Independence Day\\" DVD.  If you are playing this T2 Extreme DVD on your home DVD player (no DVD ROM), all you get are two documentaries, one version of the film, filmmaker commentary, and an interactive mode (and the regulars: subtitles, etc.)  All of those extras are fine, but nothing more than recent DVDs I have purchased and not really worth all the hype.  I suppose most people watch their DVDs on their PCs, but for those of us who don't, this DVD might be a disappointment.
B0091REZMW|3|Only gave three stars because it has promise. I've only been playing for five minutes when they guide you to give them a review. Sorry but for me it takes longer to get a true take on it. Should put your prompt in much later. It makes me wonder why they have it so early in your intro?
B000ZN8036|4|This is an amazing movie, but I'm very disappointed with the features included in the 'Into the Wild' (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition) DVD:<br /><br />- Two documentaries<br />- Theatrical trailer<br /><br />That's it.<br /><br />And why no Eddie Vedder on the DVD features? I would've expected that great Charlie Rose interview with Sean Penn and Eddie Vedder... Or at least the \\"Guaranteed\\" music video.
B00866H7SS|5|Despite the fact that this book is rather different from the books I usually read, with its explicit and sexually charged descriptions, there is no doubting the fact that it is well written. The plot is interesting, the language choice interesting and one cannot help but fall in love with the characters. True, some of these characters seem to be larger than life, but that only serves to add to their attraction, making them all the more delicious. There is never a dull moment and the book continues to grasp your interest to the point where you find it hard to put it down.<br />If you are after an extremely gripping book, which heightens your sense of romance and completely takes your mind off mundane, ordinary matters - then this is the book for you.
B002ZG98UA|4|This film is way more cool to watch on the big screen. There's tons of great action and slow-mo parts as well. It has a good opening with tons of action. It gets slow and drags from when the main group of survivors meet so i skipped that part and went to when the big guy with the oversized ax came into play. From there to the end, the film kept up. I loved all the action and characters. I liked alice, clair and chris redfield as well the people who portrayed them. The zombies and dogs were cool with there new transformations. Albert Wesker was very cool to. This film takes many ideas from Resident Evil 5 but it's every fun and cool to watch.

B00L9B7IKE|5|Wonderful, exciting book. Hard to put down.
B00BEZTMWW|3|Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy leaves one feeling the cinematic equivalent of over-eating Thanksgiving dinner. It just feels like too much, especially in relation to the light-hearted feelings one remembers from the book. I'm a huge fan of Peter Jackson's LOTR, and appreciate how well he adapted the trilogy to film. Yet, I believe he could have developed the Hobbit's storyline much more effectively in two films without all the filler (not everything has to be a trilogy). Whereas I never seem to tire of re-watching the LOTR trilogy, I have little appetite for more of the Hobbit.
B006VR65OQ|4|I was pleased with this movie.  It was based on overall computer rating and impressed me.  I use this method when I coach so I was already a believer in it.  By the way,  I did real well in coaching.  Do not knock this method until you try it awhile.
B000003S5H|5|i must say, that this is the type of album that grows on you indefinitely.  after first listening to this album, i set it neatly on my shelf along with other albums that i felt were average.  after two or three days apart  from the album, i couldn't stop thinking about it, yet i could not recall  one song.  that was nearly two years ago, and to this day, not a week goes  by where i don't at least listen to &quot;la femme d'argent&quot; or  &quot;tailsman&quot;.  i purchase four to eight albums a week to evaluate,  and this one always manages to creep in.  what else can i say?  acquire  this album, have patience with its sublety, and get ready to associate a  sense of nostalgia with this album evry time you listen to it, as if this  album has always been a part of your life.
B00009R6J7|4|Wanted a bubble level and the Manfrotto 337 seemed like a good one.  So far the level has worked well.  I have Canon 5d Mk2, level fits OK, but is not very tight.  It has not come off,but seems like a couple of good bumps if you were holding the camera lens up and it could fall off.  Only time will tell.  It has helped me to level the camera even when hand holding using livemode, so I'm happy.

B00008OLYN|5|Opeth and the D1/D2 projects, Deliverance and Damnation are a must have for any fans of death metal and progressive rock. Of the two albums, Damnation is by far the best! Deliverance is a great, solid Opeth album. However, Damnation tears it apart, but in a very different way. This album is great for all the wrong reasons most people have grown to expect from Opeth. This project was done with the intent of being a melodic, progressive rock album without distorted guitars and vocals. So, I was expecting to hear something in the neighborhood of Harvest, Face of Melinda or Credence style. Surprisingly, Damnation is nothing like any of their softer songs off of a full-length record.<br />Damnation starts of with a catchy tune right off the bat. Windowpane is an amazing song with some really cool jazzy/bluesy guitar solos. The track is about 8 minutes long, and is the longest on the album. I really love how this song flows and really is one of the best songs on the record. \\"In My Time of Need\\" is the second track, featuring the coolest vocal melodies I have heard Mikael do in a while. I really like how the verses are sung in syllables. Something about \\"In My Time of Need\\" that makes this song one of the songs I will throw the CD in to listen to. \\"Death Whispered a Lullaby\\" is a good song, but no real big highlights to mention. \\"Closure\\", is another phenomenal Opeth track with a very cool, but unusual outro that ends abruptly into \\"Hope Leaves\\". \\"Hope Leaves\\" is probably the oddball song on the album; at least it was for me. This song really took a while for it to grow on me. What really takes me now with this song are the lyrics. For some reason I really love the opening line \\"In the corner, beside my window, there hangs a lonely photograph\\". I swear this song probably took about two months of growing time for me to truly appreciate the track! \\"To Rid the Disease\\" is the next track on the record. This is another exceptional song. I really like how they did the opening music on this track. \\"To Rid the Disease\\" starts out with a guitar intro and vocals without much going on from the rest of the band. Then at about 45 seconds into the track the drums kick in with a punchy bass line from Martin Menendez. This truly catches what my buddy likes to call the \\"Martin to Marin connection\\"! \\"Ending Credits\\" is the instrumental on the album. Not a lot to say... The song is good, and that's about it! Finally we get to \\"Weakness\\". Ok, if I wrote this review the day the album released, I'd tear this song apart. I had a lot of patience with \\"Weakness\\". The track is just, well, weird. I don't know if it is that the song grew on me, or whether I have just grown in musical tastes, but I'm really partial to this song now. I really can't give a great description of the song. It is more or less vocals sung through a tube microphone and tube preamp (at least that's my guess) to get a really clean yet distorted sound on the vocals. Then the vocals are sung over some keyboards with some guitar leads here and there. Unless you have heard the song, that probably doesn't make any sense. You really have to hear \\"Weakness\\" to understand it. <br />Damnation is a must have for Opeth fans, but more so for music lovers. This album is truly a masterpiece and I was shocked to see Opeth attempt to pull something like this off. I really think they have advanced musically as a band, and have put forth a groundbreaking effort at expanding their abilities and talents. I had the chance to talk with Mikael Akerfeldt a few months ago at a concert. He said that Damnation is probably going to be the one and only album like this for a while. The next album will be a mixture of the heavy and progressive stuff as we usually see from the band. I would really like a follow up to Damnation, but on the other hand this album would have never attracted me to the band in the first place. I really like the direction Opeth took on this record and I can say without a shadow of doubt this is one of the best pieces of work the band has done. I won't say it is my favorite album by Opeth, \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" holds that spot. I would even say \\"Still Life\\" probably follows as my second favorite album. But, Damnation is my close third. I think what I really like about this album is that it is catchy. It has great guitar work, appealing vocals and the stories are vast. I also appreciate the fact that Opeth is more or less a death metal band, and went against all odds and released a clean tone, progressive rock album. I cannot praise Opeth enough for releasing Damnation, and I highly recommend this album to anyone that is willing to give it an open minded chance.

B000000H3Z|5|Sepultura, NOW, is seen as such: \\"Oh yea that horrible mallcore band with the black singer!\\" Yea I know thats horrible, but its the opinion Ive gathered lately. Rarely do the younguns think of classics like this and Schizophrenia which is what they should be. This is pretty much where Sepultura hit there peak. And it all went downhill from here. Arise was a hardly noticable dip, then a plunge from there on out. Its pretty hard to fully describe this album but if I could it would be Progressive-Death-Thrash metal. ...or something like that. <br /> <br />Sepultura is pretty underrated as musicians. (as clearly noted by other reviewers) I know Kisser doesnt have the most virtuoso solos on the planet but I mean come on him and Max were just pouring with riffs by this point. The whole CD is one big rythem guitar solo with riffs in songs like Beneath the Remains, Stronger than Hate, Lobotomy, and so on. Not to mention the percussion on this is spectacular. Its not as interesting as in later releases but there isnt much room for that crap in gut busting thrash metal. Bass... nonexistant as typical. <br /> <br />The run through of the CD is an experiance in itself. It starts with the interesting 'metallica copycat' intro that leads into Part 1 of an unstopable One-Two punch. Then a pretty underrated song Stronger Than Hate. 0:38 into the song is the coolest section of the whole CD. Its full of time changes, like the whole album is, and ends with an awesome outro. I cant figure if thats bass or guitar. Then a bit of dissonance with Mass Hypnosis smacks your face with another thrash monster. Then we have a short drum breather that lasts all of 20 seconds. Then your in for a ride. 4 amazing songs right after the other with an ending Primitive Future. The bonus tracks are nothing special. <br /> <br />So left breathless after the album I cant do anything more but to go back and bang my head through it again and again. Best tracks on the album are: Beneath the Remains, Innerself, Slaves of Pain, and Lobotomy but seriously the entire album is flawless. IF I had to throw one out it would probably be Hungry just because nothing jumps and grabs my throught about it. Please do yourself a favor, pick this one up.
B00BAXFECK|4|The subject matter is very much different but it conjured up similar feelings in me. At times it was difficult to read as BB was difficult to watch. You care so much for the lead character that it hurts when they undergo destructive behavior. The book is very good and I can't wait until it comes out in movie form.
0446677450|3|this is intended for people just starting to show an interest in personal finance and wealth management.  as such if you are just begining, you shouldnt be buying any books.  instead get a library card and consume as many as you can.  all of these introductory finance books are small and light reading, at less than 300 pages i burn through them, one book every two days. <br /> <br />this is much more of a motivational book than an informative guide.  if you are intellectually sedentary, and looking for a better way to look at things, a better perspective on life and wealth in general this may light a fire under your ass.  but it may not.  if you are looking to change your point of view i would reccomend some philosophy in addition to whatever financial research you are doing.  besides the established masters i would recommend James P. Carse's \\"Finite and Inifite Games\\".  it really does frame life in general in a very pragmatic and objective way.   <br /> <br /> <br />so why the 3 stars?  it does have some good things in there, and if you didnt know them before you should learn them.  learn the difference between assets and liabilities.  i agree with his idea that owning your own home is a liability.  i agree that investment property is a great way to get to financial independance, infact i have several relatives that did just that.  BUT, it is really contingent on hitting the right market.  my relatives hit north jersey back in the 60s and 70s, kiyosaki hit phoenix when it was hot.  i agree that the education system is sorely lacking in this area and that it should be taught (along with philosophy) in elementary on up. <br /> <br />my one contention is that most people should have already come to this conclusion on their own.  my other is that the book does nothing to elaborate any further on the subject.  it stays vague, maybe to encourage you to buy more books in the series, maybe to not pin itself down to one thing.  a much better primer would be Andrew Tobias's\\"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need\\".  Of course it wont be the only investment guide you'll need but it clearly explains the myriad of different investment opions, which will allow you to make informed decisions on what you may want to invest in and research in depth next.

0385534639|5|This was a beautiful story and it was written brilliantly.  I've read books before that I like the plot or story, but the editing, layout, or just the WAY the story is written is sub-par.  This book delivered above and beyond my expectations.
0316666343|4|This book is really good but it was really hard to read. Usually I can sit down and read a book in a few hours but with this book it took me a few months. I would start it and have to put it down. It just brings so much emotion with it. But, I would reccomend it.

B000002J1Y|5|I'm a 15 year old boy. I own =all= Yes albums on cd an most on Vinyl. I do have a record player in my room, and if it were not for the fact that they have car cd players, I  prefer Vinyls over cd's. This is a great album, all the best of Yes, and personally you don't get the raw live energy of an audience through a digitally recorded live album such as Keys. As Chris Squire said \\"It's not the band that makes a live album, but rather the energy of the audience and unless you can fit a crowd in the studio, it won't happen.\\" I write this not so much as to review the album, but to complain to a man from texas that said something to the effect of \\"Music nowadays is followed by people with 3-minute attention spans and like bands for their haido's?!!\\" Give me a freakin' break!! I'm not an anti social nerd, I have spikey hair, I look like a normal modern kid and I love Yes. Also my other favorite band tied for first with Yes is The Beatles with Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Stones, and The Doors   following. My point to all you adults is that age has nothing to it! I might be 15, but I side with you adults in saying that kids my age don't know good music from a hole in the wall because all they know is [junk], so I've done my best to turn people on the the classics and I've mad over 10 Beatles fanatics and about 7 Yes heads. Please don't be stereotypical.By the way, I play guitar bass and drums. I can play the fragile album on bass. I can play the following on guitar: Yours is no disgrace, Starship Trooper. Perpetual Change, Roundabout, South Side, Long Distance, Mood for a day, Heart Of The Sunrise, bit of CTTE, And You And I, Siberian Khatru, Turn Of The Century, Wondorous Stories, Release Release Owner and more. Write in a review if you want to be in my band, if you play bass or drums, and youre 15 or 16 :)  You'll read many other of my Beatles and Yes reviews. Peace.

1400079179|1|Bottom line: If you have ever read any other Dan Brown novel then you're going to get through the first few chapters and suddenly feel an overwhelming sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. This is dime-store literature at it's best, or worst, depending on your preference. Definitely not worth all the hype.<br /><br />On the bright side, if you happen to love dime-store novels, and have never read any of his previous \\"works,\\" then you should be content curling up with this one. (I used the term \\"works\\" loosely, thus the quotes.)<br /><br />Brown novels are different settings, the same predictable \\"surprise\\" villains, and fashionable Hollywood thrills. Ad nauseam. Amazing that this book has garnered so much attention, but religion + conspiracy = controversy, which amounts to a \\"bestseller\\" even if the writing is sub par and clich&eacute;.

B001KVZ6FC|5|I wouldn't know how to start in heaping more and more praise on a movie like this. This was the sort of movie that cinema is made for. Even being a hard R-rated dramatic character study, it manages to be not just lightly humorous, but outright laugh-out-loud hilarious in almost every scene, without ever disrupting the tone of the movie or the mood.<br /><br />The film is indeed about Walt Kowalski, which Clint Eastwood plays in a way not far from the movie personas that made him famous, and yet easily encompassing how someone would imagine someone like Dirty Harry as an 80+ year old man. He seems as though he's not \\"Clint Eastwood playing a crusty old racist\\" but rather \\"A crusty old racist playing himself\\". No matter how many racist terms he tosses out, it's always in a way that doesn't seem in any way out of the ordinary or like too much of a step for Eastwood to draw out in his acting.<br /><br />And so many of the scenes from the snarling stares given to his family and friends during his wife's funeral, to chewing out priest Janovich, sparring with Sue back and forth, there's always hilarity to be had when he starts growling or mumbling something in a voice close to Batman in \\"The Dark Knight\\".<br /><br />Yet despite his cantankerousness, racism, and stubborn need to be self-sufficient, he never ventures into the realm of disgusting or (overly)violent; he seems just as ready to string out a racist rant against ghetto-looking street thugs as he is against sheet-wearing hillbillies.<br /><br />The burgeoning friendship that builds between Walt and Thao is sweet without stepping into being saccharine, and the climax of the film is intense, causing a great change in Walt that would seem fully unexpected in a movie character, yet in this context is not only done brilliantly, but Clint Eastwood develops his character so thoroughly, that he becomes the character as deeply and richly as Daniel Day-Lewis did Daniel Plainview in \\"There Will Be Blood\\": You fully believe Walt Kowalski could be a real person. He is in no way a hero or a villain, but just a normal person.<br /><br />To the end of the film, Walt remains an unrepentant racist and bitter, cantankerous old man hateful of almost anything, but where his own family is alienated from his life, he seems to gain a new one in the form of Thao and his family.person. He is in no way a hero or a villain, but just a normal person.

1592400876|4|In this day and age of IM text, increasing reliance on word processing program spell checkers instead of live editors that cost money, and generally poor education in which children aren't even taught what a semicolon is or does, this book was a delight to see.<br /><br />Yes, the author is British; yes, some American readers might be confused by her colloquialisms and word usage.  That isn't the point.  Contrary to a previous reviewer, who must be even more of a punctuation and grammar freak than I am, the author does set out to do what she intended.  She points out just how far our skills in written English have fallen, and why.<br /><br />Granted, most of us don't have the leisure afforded to intellectuals to debate the use of single quotes vs double quotes.  We just need to know the proper usage for either.<br /><br />In this day and age where I can pick out at least three typos per every issue of TIME magazine and the Wall St Journal - grammatical, spelling, and/or punctuation - which would have been unheard of before someone decided that MS Word's grammar checker didn't have to be paid a salary and would suffice in place of human editors, books like this are necessary.  They should be mandatory reading for high-school English classes.
0913866156|5|Crowley broke ties with his former compatriots at the Golden Dawn and set out to turn the world on its collective ear. Along the way he created this breathtaking deck, with the gracious assistance of Lady Frieda Harris. This is an occult masterpiece of mythic proportions. It is his greatest work, and one of his few not riddled with lies and deceptions. It has been the tool of many a gifted reader and scores of magicians, prognosticators, charlatans, and even a few nefarious scoundrels of magic. It is alpha and omega - for it is both an extension of, and the counterpart to Waite's tarot.<br /><br />The feel is dark elegance, with heavy usage of blues and gold/yellows, with grays and greens finding their way into the backgrounds. It is not that there is ANY lack of other colors contained herein. The notation is a hint at Crowley's disposition affecting the implied symbolism of such usage in that it guided the direction of creation of this deck. this deck reeks energy, even before you pick it up - but it has a life of its own and you must fit the deck, or it will not 'behave.' Until you experience the bond (or aggravated agitation) possible with this deck, you simply have to guess at how dominant a force this can (and will) be in your readings and ritual use.<br /><br />This deck was specifically designed for ritual more than simple divination. Each card is a magical statement of human will over nature's wild (untamed) energies. In this way it clashed head on with Waite's vision of the magician in harmony. Just as there are many paths to your destination (whatever that may be) this deck is one of many. It either fits you, or it does not. But s to divinatory quality, none EXISTING [as of this writing] surpass this most excellent tool. I would not suggest this to anyone as a starter deck, as there is far too much occult (hidden) symbolism to learn of The Tarot that the novice cannot grasp from viewing these cards.<br /><br />Note: This card draws far more heavily on astrological influences than others (Waite for instance) but it is not at all an astrological construct. A great ritual tool that is also a quality divination device if you have a solid foundation of knowledge in the Tarot AND Astrology (and other sciences here unmentioned, should you be so inclined).

B00D7Z4GQY|5|I loved this book! The characters came to life and the story line draws you into a place we have all been. The reader will be able to relate to this book. Reading it was like sitting down with your best friend and sharing the towns gossip; thanking God that it is not your life, but enjoying each and every juicy detail.
B0001MDP3G|5|GREAT!
B007BVOEPI|5|Yep, heard about it.  Heard about the books too.  Never thought much about checking them out because most of the time with big cinema stuff like this they get it all wrong.  Nope, not this time.  I was enthralled from the very first episode.

0446580848|5|I absolutely loved this book. Nelson DeMille did it again with John Corey and his wife Kate Mayfield. What I loved even more is the fact that he brought back another great character (about time too) and that would be Paul Brenner. I won't go into what the book is about because if you are reading this review you already know. Let me say that the story moves at a good pace and the interaction between Corey and Brenner is classic. I'm hoping that because of the ending we may be seeing another joint effort of the two. You won't want to miss this addition to the John Corey series, you won't be disappointed.
B000001Y5D|4|I got this record after I heard What's up, not really for it, just hoping it was going to be interesting and I got lucky. The album is really good, a lot harder than I would have thought. It starts in force with Train, it's quite unexpected really, and then it goes in the same vein with Superfly. Things cool down a little after that, but they don't really get pensive. There is sheer force throughout the album and not only due to the impressive vocals (but largely thanks to it all the same). Very good drum work and guitars are up to it as well. I was impressed with the variety of themes as well, it's not the kind of thing that goes on with the same kind of songs, changing the tune a bit from one to the next. No, every song has its well defined personality, no way to mix them up. The other thing about it is the actual recording, it sounds absolutely briliant, one of the best sounding records I've got, even if it goes back all that time. Sounds a lot better than a lot of remastered albums if you asked me. Too bad it was the one and only, but there you go. Better than five so and so albums, that's for sure.

B009EBLCK8|5|My wife and I started watching this show a couple weeks ago. We're hooked. Well written and interesting. Would definitely recommend it.
630025111X|5|I rank it as one of the all-time best movies ever made--- for those who love the American West and that way of life. If you like &quot;Shane&quot;, Jerm. Johnson, and similar--- you will like this movie. Mama Cass's  rendition of &quot;The Good Times are Coming&quot; is perfect. It has been  30 yrs-- and I still love the atmosphere and story of this GEM!
B001RTSPVY|3|Okay, I am going to go against the grain of other reviewers here and (without spoilers) give you the true scoop on Season 2.  As we all recall, Season 1 was more than riveting, it was groundbreaking storytelling at its finest.  Season 2 starts off this way and then takes a sharp decline.  It is almost as if the first three episodes and the last three episodes of Season 2 were written by someone else.  The middle episodes (while still better than most other schlock on television) seemed to drag on forever.  I cannot help it, I find Walt's wife to be the least likable, least interesting, and the character I would most love to see killed off in the entire series (with Hank a close second, but he gets better developed in Season 3).  Season 2 spends a lot of time focusing on Skyler, her pregnancy and Walt's medical condition.  Yeah, I am aware that these are central to the series, but enough already, we get it, can we move on to the more interesting aspects of this series?  Maybe it was just me, but I found the finale to be less than climactic and could see it coming from the second to last episode.  Maybe I am just jaded by how great Season 1 was and Season 3 is (which I am watching now - hint: Much more like Season 1 - AMAZING).  Again, I am not bashing this show, I find the entire series to be superior to most all others I have watched, however once you set such a high standard, it is imperative to live up to it with each episode and not throw fillers in mid-season just to drag the story out longer.  Tell your story clearly and concisely.  No, this is not a short-attention span thing, it is a classic storytelling rule that should be adhered to.  Admittedly, I watched the entire season in about 3 days, so maybe I was just overwhelmed by everything that was going on, but you would think that (given that short span of time) I would not have felt that the show was moving along too slow. Now, the haters can hate and bash this review, but if you are a true fan of this series, you must admit that I am right on at least a few points.  And for those comparing this series to THE SHIELD...come on!!!  THE SHIELD jumped the shark the minute they killed Lem.  The rest of that show was a jumbled mess.  THE SHIELD does not even deserve to stand in Breaking Bad's shadow.  Final thought: Breaking Bad is still one of the finest series ever. Period, full stop, end of discussion.

B000001DTM|5|Should be required listening for anyone trying to deepen his or her enjoyment of music.  Seriously, it is that good.  This album does not play like it is over 10 years old; in fact, it embarrasses most of the bands out there today, indicting them with compelling lyrics and heart-piercing instrumentation.  Time to grow up and add this to your collection.

B00IFMHZ58|5|I loved this movie- if you were a fan of the original TV series, this movie feels like an extended TV series episode in a great way--sharp witty dialogue, familiar faces, who dun it mystery...it was so great that so many of the original actors came back!! ( i love you enrico colantoni...you always play my favorite characters...from VM to flashpoint to POI)<br /><br />From its kickstarter beginnings to its presence on social media (it won MTV's most anticipated movie--beating out hunger games and divergent and the maze...how's that for  fan loyalty!!??)  this movie really did feel like it was fan driven.  If you were lucky enough (and smart enough) to be a kick starter backer, you received updates as the movie was filmed and edited and that just made it feel more OURS.<br /><br />Great job,marshmallows!!  oh..and the ending leaves it open for a sequel!!  (woohoo! runs to kickstarter to start funding  VM2...pretty please??)<br /><br />oh..and TEAM LOGAN!
B00280LYHS|5|The book was action packed. I love the resolution of the story. I feel like it went full circle. I am glad that the Heroes paid a big tribute to the classics like the Iliad, The Odyssey, and the Chronicles of Perseus. Maybe, just maybe it will breed new fans for the world of antiquity.

B00005JLEX|1|The show is not funny. There are too many reasons I could list here to explain, but I don't have 5 or 6 hours to list them all here.<br /><br />The number one reason for me, though, is that even though it carries itself off as a comedy, all it has EVER been was a bunch of people smashed up through odd circumstances, arriving at impossibly unusual, uncomfortable endings which we are expected to \\"laugh\\" while squirming, all set up by the sheer ugliness and meanspiritedness of the writers' intent. They succeed in making you feel bad, then make you feel smug - why? - because it's not happening to you.<br /><br />I expected better from them, and received NOTHING in return for it.<br /><br />Now I know why everyone says \\"it's a show about nothing.\\"<br /><br />It truly is nothing.<br /><br />Buy yourself a copy of any of the seasons of \\"The West Wing\\" or even \\"E.R.\\" if you had to, but please - don't waste your time here.<br /><br />AND put another shiny coin into Jerry's already well-documented and well-bloated pockets.<br /><br />Oy!

B00005NRNB|5|I love the new superbit collection dvds.  Criterion collection a vista are both doing a great job in creating movie viewing pleasure Through extras, picture and sound but superbit is coming back with some strong DVD's.  The sound is so strong and tight.  Utilization of every field of sound leds to an experience you will not forget.  I've watched this movie ten or more times before the superbit.  Now I haved added to this number greatly.  Wolfgang Peterson has made one of those few movies that make you happy for watching it.  Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman did a fantasic job with each character.  All I can say is watch it on the superbit and you can thank me later.
B004UPALT6|2|If you liked ED1 then you will probably like ED2 because it's basically the same movie with minor script changes.
B00004WG2F|5|According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness.  Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy.  They become legend.  And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect.  \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" directed by Edward Zwick, is the story of Tristan (Brad Pitt) and his brothers, Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (Henry Thomas); a tragic story of the life they shared and the wounds they suffered, many of which were never to heal.  And it's their father's story, as well, for it was he who raised his boys with only the help of his loyal friend, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis), after his wife, Isabel (Christina Pickles), unable to withstand the harsh Montana winters, had left her family for the more civilized East Coast, never to return.<br /> Colonel Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) had served his country during the Indian Wars, after which, disheartened by the government's treatment of those they had suppressed, the proud people of the Indian Nations, he turned his back on the \\"civilized\\" ways of his own people and carved out a niche for himself and his family in Montana.  And it was there, on their ranch, that the boys learned the ways of the West and the ways of the Indian, under the tutelage of their father and One Stab.  But of the three, only Tristan eventually heard that inner voice with such clarity that he could neither deny nor ignore it, and it awakened a passion within him that he embraced, and which set him upon the path he was seemingly destined to follow; a path that would ultimately affect the lives of everyone he had ever loved.<br /> By 1914, Europe was at war, and the very tenets of truth and justice that had driven Colonel Ludlow away from society now compelled his sons to take a stand according to their own beliefs.  Despite his recent engagement, Samuel decides to go to Canada and enlist in the army in order to fight for England.  Alfred and Tristan refuse to let him go alone, and enlist with him.  And in the desolate, muddy trenches of France, they soon learn the harsh truth and the reality of war-- just as their father had before them-- and by the time the war has ended for them, their lives have changed forever; Tristan's most especially.  Back home, Tristan tries to settle down to life on the ranch, but the restlessness of his soul speaks to him of things he must do and places he must go, and the voices are too strong to resist.  So despite the ties that bind him to the home and the people he loves, he sets out on a journey of self-discovery that eventually takes him, physically and emotionally, into places he never knew existed-- and away from the woman who loves him the most.<br /> Director Edward Zwick delivers a sweeping saga of life and love with this film that is every bit as big and grand as the country in which it is set.  He presents his story through the recollections of One Stab, the one who saw it all unfold, first hand.  And it gives the film a narrative quality that is storytelling at it's best.  Zwick had a vision of how to bring this tale to the screen, and he realized it magnificently, aided by John Toll's breathtakingly beautiful cinematography (for which he received an Oscar), Lilly Kilvert's superb set designs and James Horner's compelling, dramatic score.  And most importantly, through the tremendous performances of Hopkins, Pitt, Quinn, Thomas and the lovely Julia Ormond.  <br /> Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses.  And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life.  Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers.  Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care.  It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.<br /> The supporting cast includes Karina Lombard (Isabel Two), Paul Desmond (Decker), Tantoo Cardinal (Pet) and Robert Wisden (John T. O'Banion).  A visually stunning film that will touch you emotionally and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark, \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" perpetuates the tradition of classics like \\"The Big Country\\" and \\"Giant.\\"  Engaging and memorable, it's a transporting experience, courtesy of the magic of the movies.
B002K0WBXW|4|Falling in love with the one person you never thought you might like is a refreshing story, especially when played by Bullock and Reynolds. Silly and entertaining with the bonus of Betty White being as silly and cute as ever.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I really enjoy this game even though it can be frustrating.  I play it all the time on two different machines.
B00IK1J9QM|4|Great read
B008NW67E0|3|I don't really enjoy their music, but the daughter does.  I imagine that if I were her age I might find it new and exciting instead of derivative.
B002ZG99TA|4|Usually when I think about trains I think of my childhood (and on) love affair with that then vanishing way of getting around. Simple enough when  the local commuter train, then soon to be abandoned in the 1950s golden age of the automobile, the highway and the Howrad Johnson's (and subsequently McDonald's) pit stop night, came tooting its lonesome whistle in the high North Adamsville night. Or that same fascination held up later when I took my first baby steps on the endless search for the great blue-pink American West night and wound up a few time travelling in some desolate empty  box car pushing the Southern Pacific high desert night. And no question, even now I have very strong memories of what Tom Waits called in one of his mule variation day dreams- \\"living on train smoke and dreams.\\"<br /><br />But enough of nostalgia, earned or not. For the film under review, Unstoppable,  is a very different cinematic look at the modern day train experience on the American tracks. Trains and disaster, or the threat of disaster,  are no strangers today, and have not been since the beginning of the railroads. The runaway train that stars in this film, the old 777 running highly dangerous cargo through rural Pennsylvania in this case, is just a continuation of the danger associated with tangling with the train smoke (from whatever fossil fuel used). And this saga is based on a real incident too boot.<br /><br />Through carelessness (and corporate speed-up policies) a railroad man makes a series of wrong decisions about how to fix a problem on his long-line freight train. And the thing takes off-ummanned. Naturally all hell breaks loose as everyone from the yard master to corporate headquarters tries to figure out how to stop the thing short of shooting it (although that thought I am sure crossed somebody's mind). No problem though because old railroad man Denzel Washington, ready to be tossed on the washed-out heap and training his \\"new boy replacement,\\"  just happens to be on that same track coming the other way. Now once Denzel Washington is on the case, any cinematic case, from cop to Malcolm X to washed-out train engineer, one can rest easy. Sure there will be a couple of close calls, quite a few actually, in the hour and one half of the film but at the end of the day no highly explosive cargo is going to harm urban areas. No way. Now we can all go back to thinking about train smoke and dreams.
B000060P79|3|Simple Plan is not Blink 182. They are way too Pop to be called Blink.  None of their tracks hard enough to please true punk rock fans.  All of Simple Plans tracks kinda sound the same but that isn't always a bad thing.  I think this album would apeal more to teenage girls who watch MTV all day than 18 guys who are looking for harder beats.  It is a good album at first but the POP soon takes over and it makes put away the CD for good.
B00002N9ER|5|I installed these on the side of my drivers seat. Looks awesome, plus maglites make a great billy club right inside the door.
B004RJMUJO|3|I am really nervous about what people are saying and I sort of agree with most of them like needing internet to play the game maybe they can HACK us and get into our personal information so I am just going to tell the truth when I read some of the comments I got really nervous and deleted the game from my device quickly. Just incase they could find out where I live. DO NOT GET THIS FREAKISH APP DO NOT I TELL YOU THEY COULD FIND OUT YOUR PHONE NUMBER OR WHERE YOU LIVE. So I am deleting this freakish piece of crap off my kindle. Listen to me like I am your mother and do not get the app, understand ?  If you do good if you don't...well let's say it's your doom not mine.
B000A0GYD2|5|If you've ever had even an inkling of interest about the decision and enormous undertaking to go to the moon, you will love this mini-series.  It's practically a documentary, but with great actors.  Every episode is edge-of-your-seat-interesting.  I rarely guarentee that you'll love it, but I've recommended this one to so many people who have that I'm pretty confident in this recommendation.
B00DDTQE1Y|5|One of the most powerful and attractive photo editors I have ever use. Heaps of tools and features wrapped up in an intuitive and user friendly interface. I'm going to uninstall all my other photo editors now.

B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved the book - written with compassion and understanding
B00SH04286|4|it was pretty good 4star
B00AZRBLHO|5|First of all, I loved the book!  With The Phoenix Project, Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford has written one of the most thought-provoking IT books I've read in recent years.<br /><br />The Phoenix Project is actually a novelization of DevOps principles rather than a strict how-to book on transforming IT Operations.  It is written in the tradition of IT Novels such as the Stealing The Network series, which I read voraciously when I was learning about Information Security.  I find the idea of using the genre of fiction to teach IT theory to be extremely effective, especially the concepts of DevOps, which are foreign to so many who are in the \\"traditional\\" IT space.  The Phoenix Project provides a vivid use case that describes the dysfunctional relationship which exists, not only between traditional IT and the Lines of Business, but between different groups within IT itself.  But not only does the book describe the problem, it offer a path to follow in order to transform IT into a true partner to the Business.<br /><br />The protagonist in The Phoenix Project is Bill Palmer, newly promoted to VP of IT Operations for Parts Unlimited, a leading automotive parts manufacturer and retailer.  The problem is that Palmer has been promoted because his managers were fired due to the failures of the IT department, particularly in completing a software initiative, called The Phoenix Project.  This Phoenix Project is a software suite, developed in-house, designed to integrate manufacturing and retail while allowing Parts Unlimited to be more agile and nimble in accommodating to changes in market conditions.  The project is intended to save the company, which has missed earning consistently and has fallen behind its main competitor; unfortunately, the project is millions of dollars over-budget and years late in delivery.  Palmer is thrown on to the proverbial sinking ship and quickly caught up in one emergency after another and soon realizes that unless something quickly changes, The Phoenix Project is doomed to failure and along with it, Parts Unlimited.  However, Palmer finds himself ill-equipped to understand and to implement the necessary changes to right the ship, especially when there is so much distrust and infighting within the IT organization and with the Lines of Business.<br /><br />Then Palmer meets the enigmatic Erik Reid, a potential board member with some very unusual ideas for how to run IT Operations.  Palmer is understandably skeptical but is soon drawn in as Reid takes him down the rabbit hole; through a series of encounters and events, Reid enlightens Palmer as to what is the true mission of IT and what must be done to make IT work as a partner to the Business.  The truths that are discovered not only change Palmer but the entire culture of IT at Parts Unlimited.<br /><br />I had two different reactions as I was reading The Phoenix Project.  The first half of the book often made me reflexively reach for the Maalox as I found myself standing in Palmer's shoes, reliving outages caused by buggy code and miscommunication between IT departments.  The second half of the book reads like the script from The Karate Kid, as we see Erik Reid, Aka. Mr. Miyagi, guide Bill Palmer, Aka. young Daniel, down the path to enlightenment about not only the methodology of DevOps but the cultural shift that is required for change.  Sometimes the lessons involve seeing tasks that seem to have little value to sound IT Operations, but Reid is able to masterfully walk Palmer through the process until he sees the proper connections between Manufacturing Plant operations and IT Operations.<br /><br />That relationship between Manufacturing Plants and IT was, for me, the key insight provided by the book.  As Erik Reid succinctly states to Bill Palmer, \\"If you think IT Operations has nothing to learn from Plant Operations, you're wrong. Dead wrong.  Your job as VP of IT Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service.\\"  This is one of the best definition of IT Operations and also one of the most insightful statements on resource management that I've read to date.  After all, what can be more basic to resource management, rather it be a data center, software development team, Cloud, or people, than ensuring they deliver value through the completion of planned work?  Yet I would argue that because this is not the ultimate goal of many IT shops, they are easily sidetracked by the urgent and prevented from doing what is important.<br /><br />The rest of the book shows how Palmer, with help from Reid, is able to inculcate a new culture in the IT department at Parts Unlimited so they can focus on the mission of saving the company by enabling the business of the company.  Along the way, they learn about the four categories of work (business projects, internal IT projects, changes, and unplanned work), the Three ways, and the importance of Kanban.  Each new discovery by Palmer and team is a call to action for IT departments that know they cannot maintain the status quo and must transform themselves to meet the demands of the current business environment.<br /><br />I  look forward to learning more and applying the principles from books such as the Phoenix Project.  Now if only I could find a portable version of a Kanban Board!
1400052181|5|I had to read this book for class, and the way that it was introduced to us I thought it would be primarily a research methods book. When I opened it and started reading I had to make myself put it down because it is so much more! I finished this book in two days. I found myself so engrossed in it that I had forgotten to eat & had to make myself sleep. It is so good. It's informative, and makes me think about life and history in a new way. I'm hoping that someone picks this book up and make it a movie ;-)
B001DJLCRC|5|Life is fragile and uncertain.  How does an intellectual deal with this,  create a narrative for his life ?<br />PhDs, especially in the hard sciences from big name universities are often saddled with the life-long burden of needing to live the life of the mind- the intellectual, to have unique insights that no one else in the world has had, to see the big picture of humanity as only a feeble part of the great wonder of Nature.<br />But then we are forced to live in this world, where most other people are incurious about what we seem to care about, instead mostly concerned about making money, maneuvering  for power - all to head to Costco at the end of the day, only to buy that 2 gallons of virgin olive oil or that 100 inch Flat TV newly on sale there.<br />How do we get through this meaninglessness? How do we decide on the 'noble' course of action?<br />And how do you get through, if you have just been diagnosed with terminal cancer at age 50, there is an unplanned pregnancy, and you are a very overqualified high school chemistry teacher?<br />Walter Hartwell White does work that eventually leads to a Nobel Prize at CalTech. he founds a company but then drops out to teach high school, unappreciated by his students, and washing cars to make ends meet, for his family, especially his wife who doesnt seem to get him either.<br />of course, we all know that he puts his knowledge of science of chemistry to cooking the best crystal meth -<br />This setting seems unlikely, but results in the greatest TV show I have ever seen, combining great drama, social insight, suspense and even comedy.<br />And even as the captivating end comes, we agree with him that he didnt do it 'for his family' but for himself ' he enjoyed it, he was good at it, and it 'made me feel alive'.
B000HL2J0G|4|Creative plots, although unrealistic, very entertaining, family friendly.
0143119680|4|When I first picked up this book to read it, I couldn't get in to it. So I put it aside, read other books, and then came back to it. I have to chalk up my first experience to exhaustion, or a short burst of insanity. The second time was the charm. I listened to this book on audio as well as read through it. If you like audio books I definitely would recommend this one. Jennifer Ikeda narrates and does a fantastic job. Very enjoyable.<br />The story itself is epic. It's full of vivid details and imagery that blew me away. There are quite a few supernatural characters in this book. Don't worry, keeping track of them doesn't get confusing. I love all their distinct personalities. The story sucks you in from the beginning. Mathew and Diana are mesmerizing characters. They have great chemistry together. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens between them. The story line is built around a missing manuscript.Diana has been doing research and retrieves a manuscript that has been missing for years and years. She puts the book back, but not before gathering the attention of some very powerful supernaturals.  All the supernaturals are waiting for Diana to retrieve the book from the library, including Matthew and her fellow witches and wizards. Diana is the only one who is not interested in retrieving the book. She's not sure if she can fully trust Matthew or understand why he's helping her. He's a vampire after all. And vampires and witches don't mix. However he might be her only chance to survive.  Diana discovers that there is a dark side to witchcraft. She's been running away from  her true self.  Diana must either embrace who she is, or continue on her current path of blindness unprepared for what lies ahead. There is so much intrigue it kept me reading late into the night. This book has it all: great characters, interesting story line, a bit a romance, and lots of mystery.You can tell the author did a lot of research for A Discovery of Witches, from thehistory to the geography. This is definitely a book I'd recommend to the paranormal lovers out there. I can't wait to delve into the second book, Shadow of Night.
B004JZBGWI|5|In one ear and out the other. Early Alzheimer's I suppose. Either way, this app allows me to keep track of everything from work tasks, grocery lists, even doctor appointments. You can split up and label lists however you need to organize them. This app has been so helpful for a busy, working mom like me!

0307742997|3|It was pretty obvious who the killer was from the moment he was introduced to the reader.  Hello, he was the one who could dispose of the bodies.  I enjoyed the characters, the writing, the twists, but how on earth could police not look into a locked freezer in a victim's cabin. They dragged the lake, but didn't open a door?  What???  So, ten years later our hero discovers a body of a missing policeman.  No, No, No.
B001XRLWPQ|5|Funny, campy, clever, with appealing characters and character-driven plots. This series is a lot of fun and the price was good because this season has been out for a long time.
030788743X|1|If this author isn't a commentary on the dangers of immersing oneself in pop culture and nothing else, I don't what is. This book is cosmetically pleasing but has little to no substance. The reading level of this novel, at most, is middle school equivalent. This book is a moderate attempt at flexing the author's muscular 80's pop culture knowledge and wrapping it in a so-so plot line.
B001AQTWF2|5|Whitney Houston is one of my favorite singers. I brought this because I wanted to have a cd of her music. I had no recent cd of her music.

0307588335|5|Don't let the topic scare you off.  This was a user-friendly read regardless of your background.  McDonald takes the financial crisis,  a bewildering mystery for most of us, and breaks it down to easily understood components:  greed, ignorance and a colossal failure of responsibility as well as common sense.
0060873027|1|As no stars is not an option, one star it is. This is amateurish at best, written as though by a struggling student for an assignment. Perhaps the plot was original to Crichton but that has to be all. It is incredibly repetitive, redundant, the same words are used over and over and over. Annoying? Yup, that's my point. Rick said, Karen said, Amar said, Jenn said. Please! At the very least use a thesaurus. Perhaps try changing your sentence structure. Anything. It is a shame that Crichton's name is on this product and an embarrassment for Richard Preston. James Rollins providing such a laudatory review is astonishing. Ugh.
B008TRUDAS|5|Colleen Hoover does a fabulous job of addressing the toughest life issues with insight, pathos and humor. It's a roller coaster ride of laughing and crying with characters you can relate to from the get go.
B008Y6MKSW|4|A classic film.  Bill Murray as Phil, the self-centered jerk who is forced to live the worst day in his life over and over until he gets it right, is spot on.  Andie MacDowell is great as the co-worker who helps Phil finally get out of his instant karma.
B009EEOQIU|4|I wasn't blown away, nor was I bored. It was a really decent movie, even if it was corny at times. Being more of a historical drama, thriller fan. I did say &#34;this is no princess bride&#34;... but it was close enough to keep me entertained.
B002E0JL86|5|Great movie!!!
B00005QW5X|5|Outstanding! One of my top ten favorite movies of all time.....soundtrack is awesome too.
B000GCFG7E|5|Another good Jack Reacher Book by Lee Child. I'm reading all the series, and am waiting for the 18th book in the series
630587493X|5|I rented this DVD with the expectation that it would be the  &quot;typical&quot; Robin Williams movie. I knew that the movie had been  panned by some critics and did poorly at the box office, so I wasn't  expecting much. Half way through the movie I actually paused it and turned  to my wife and asked her: &quot;were the critics watching the same  movie?&quot; This ended up being an incredibly thoughtful film, deep on  many levels. In my opinion this was a film that suffered from poor  marketing. The TV trailers implied a comedy, when in fact it is a thought  provoking film. Transfer is excellent.
B00EHMFC78|5|Great series. A MUST read for everyone, can't put the series down twist and turn keeps you reading on and on.  Don't start at night or you will be up all night reading.g
B00AN0KGWE|5|Excellent, maybe not quite season 1 but I burned through the whole season in about 3 days. Can't wait for third
6305428042|5|I'm a 16 yr old who still watches Disney(So sue me, I hate MTV and the Pop rage). I never knew this movie was in theatres until I read these reviews! I just finished watching Hocus Pocus on TV tonight and thought I'd look it up on Amazon to see if it were on DVD/VHS. This movie is a classic, and I watch it every time it comes on. I have the soundtrack, which consists of like 2 songs, on Kazaa Media. It's the greatest halloween movie of the 90s for kids, and even teenagers, because I know alot of kids at school like it as well. Hope this review will help someone out! I would recommend this movie to anyone-my dad says it's one of the few things SJP did that was decent acting, lol!
B004IPPINW|5|I really enjoy Mohsin Hamid's writing style.  This is the second book of his I've read.  He really draws you along in the story, and writes clearly and concisely.  No extraneous words to get in the way of enjoying the story line.

B003MC5N28|5|After reading some of the one-star reviews, I felt that I needed to write a review explaining how wonderful and how essential this book is for everyone.  Many people have loads of complaints, asking for explanations for silly unimportant stuff like why can't they see color or how did they remove hills, how did they mange climate control, etc.  Well here is your answer... IT DOES NOT MATTER!!!  You are supposed to read this book and wonder, but not so much that it causes you to hate the book.
B007J4T2G8|3|While this book may not be for everyone, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be reading the next one to find out what happens between Ana and Mr Grey story
B0063GORYU|4|I love this game. Not only is it fun, but challenging as well. I look forward to updates. Hopefully, some new backgrounds or backs of the cards. Thank you to the makers and design.
B006E4QCXU|5|When I read the reviews about getting lost in watching the app and losing track of time I thought it was a slight exaggeration. But being an adult with ADHD I can vouch for the mesmerisingness off playing with the app. BUT something happened that made it even better! I was listening to Democracy Today on my Kindle Fire and the had a break and they were playing &quot;Radiation&quot; by Kraftwork (sp) and man that really added to the enjoyment of the playing of the app so I highly recommend you check out that song, find something similar (it's electronic type music - dunno what they call that these days :) that you like that fits and go with it. you'll find it brings out the best of the app
B003K1EYM6|1|It does not recognize any image files on my SD card.
B00H8AXJR6|1|I'd like to paint a picture about the kind of person I am. I love romantic movies. Love them. I even really enjoy coming-of-age- romantic movies about teenagers. They make me feel hopeful. I preorder romantic movies on Amazon on my way home from seeing the movie in the theatre. That's how much I love them. This movie is neither of those things - it's not romantic and it's barely a coming-of-age story because Sutter doesn't learn anything, not really. This movie idealizes alcoholism and proves that you can have whatever you want if you just cry a little and play thoughtful songs in the background. Seriously, that alcoholism is painted as cute and endearing and very simple to get over is truly offensive. Also, I was completely shocked by how totally misogynistic &#34;The Spectacular Now&#34; is. It completely undoes all the strong female characters Shailene Woodley has played to date. Amy is the exact opposite from Tris. She is the weakest female character that I've seen portrayed in a long, long time.  I think Woodley is great, but this movie flies in the face of all the work teachers and parents (and hopefully all people, come on) do to help girls be confident, independent, thoughtful women. Please, please look beyond the pretty faces in this movie, and if you're a teenage girl and you watch it, learn nothing from it other than to NEVER be like any of the characters ever. EVER. As a romantic and as an educator of teenage women, I am offended by this movie and I urge you to watch &#34;A Walk to Remember&#34; instead of this. It's the same movie except better. So, so much better.

B000002NG7|5|I did see quite a few negative reviews of this album, but the bottom line: THIS ALBUM, like all Faith No More albums, IS INCREDIBLE. All four studio albums with Patton are absolutely incredible. Out of all the FNM CDs with Patton, this is probably the one I listen to the MOST, because it's such an interesting album, and much different from the other FNM albums (however, every FNM album is different). With every listen, you appreciate this album more. In some ways, it was Faith No More's most normal-sounding rock album. <BR>&quot;Album of the Year&quot; is a fantastic album, and probably the most underrated FNM album with Patton (though all of FNM's albums are underrated).
B00F91RYL8|4|Was not bad but was too much like i am legend. (Lots of main actor, little bit of zombies)  wish they had stuck with max brooks' format in novel. The ensemble cast of walking dead works better. But then brad would have had to share screen time & that's a &#34;no go&#34; when he is the producer.
B004ADH1RI|5|Great classic. Be careful how old your kids are watching.<br />It taught my son some colorful language!
B0077ATSSQ|2|It doesn't happen often but I decided to quit watching this movie halfway through it maybe one day I'll revisit it but I doubt it.(I stopped immediately after the scene at the lock manufacture which was suppose to be a very powerful moment).  The young actor, Thomas Horn is excruciatingly terrible, yes I understand what he was attempting to capture, but it failed miserably and just destroyed any credibility of realism I have in this character.  Sorry Thomas, and I think you know this already by the lack of work you had since 2010, acting is not your strong suit.
6302424739|5|Funny, intelligent, and ultimately rather sad.  It is the only movie that successfully brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it.
B005LAIIN0|4|Zombies are dead so they aren't very clever and they aren't very fast and therefore aren't very scary.  The Walking Dead used shear numbers to up the spook factor of the zombie, but still.  28 Days Later introduced the fast zombie - now that's scary.  World War Z takes the fast zombie and adds the numbers and now we've got a real problem.  Not to spoil too much, but just imagine if you of these got on an airplane!<br /><br />This is a good old fashioned monster movie with better than average acting and much better than average special effects.  It will make you jump more than a few times and a couple of scenes will have you on the edge of your seat.  It's a fun film, and a good excuse to kill a bucket of popcorn.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Full of unexpected twists and turns. Enjoyed! Definitely a fun  read. Thought it was a really good book to read
B000JBWWBK|5|One of my favorite movies!!!!!
B00IG2DOKM|5|I love this one.  Great little game and best of all it's free.  Playing is fun and you can do it in your spare time and nothing spoils so I don't have to worry about checking on things when I'm busy.  Again great little game.
B00DU761TY|1|Today's Free Ap of the Day reminded me of this little gem. Too bad this has now become a free app infested with ads. Gameplay is still fun but not worth the intrusion.
B002NZTZ8S|5|It is magical.  Not just the first time you watch it, but every time!
B00AGOGOLE|3|I wish that it was a rear facing camera. I used it only once, seems a little awkward. However, at least there is a camera.
B0063IH60K|5|It is a simple easy card game for beginners or seasoned card players. I love it because it is quick and easy.
B000063DHL|4|Originally released in fall, 1986 as 'Somewhere In Time' looks to be Maiden's sixth studio lp. In my humble opinion, it's about as potent as their previous efforts like 'Number Of The Beast', 'Piece Of Mind' or 'Powerslave'. But these British merchants of metal mayhem seem to have put out SO many releases now, I've sort of lost track. Best thing about 'Somewhere' is they'd decided to now employ a synthesizer in their sound, very wise move. Tracks I remember the most off this CD reissue are the album's single \\"Wasted Years\\", \\"Sea Of Madness\\", \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" (love the old MTV video) and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\". Cut to the chase, if you were a fan of '80's metal (like I was / still am), then you should check out this catalog title.
B008XG1X18|1|It won't let me log in to pinterest with my Facebook account but I have it on my iPhone and it works just fine will give 5 stars when fixed
B0099RFVXQ|5|The special effects in this movie were amazing.  The non stop action kept you completely engrossed through out the movie.
B00ET0PZDO|5|I have to say that I really enjoyed playing this game. The only problem was that it was too short. Wish there were more levels. Totally fun to figure out the levels provided though.
B00MIA0KGY|5|My mom loves this gift! Not only the wonderful Barbra but great duet!<br /><br />Did arrive a day late, not two-day per Amazon Prime, though.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Loved it especially I used it for youtube videos, like a usb, convenient to carry to anywhere, worked with my iphone 5 really well, prompt delivery and good quality. Thank you!
B003G8Y4QO|5|For those of you who have never seen Dr. Who...  You owe it to yourself to at least give it a try.  Each episode is like a thriller movie from start to finish.  Great story writing!
B00BUCW54Q|4|Not quite as good as the book. Tom Cruise just did not seem like a Kack Reacher type.
B00FAPF5U0|3|Way too fustrating!  But I do it anyway!
B003XF1XOQ|5|Loved the continuation of a series that I could hardly put down until it was finished. Tense, exciting, and well developed.

B000005JA8|1|In Detroit, there's a self-proclaimed &quot;artist&quot; that spent over a decade collecting old, ratty shoes and attaching them to the outer walls and roof of his house.  Called simply &quot;The Shoe House,&quot; the  massive eyesore represents the diversity of humanity and the journey  through life in which we all must walk.  Or something like that.<br />Trout  Mask Replica reminds me of The Shoe House.  Here's a guy that wastes more  than a year painstakingly teaching his band how to play the weirdest, most  fatally warped, unlistenable music imaginable.  The Shoe House is, to any  reasonable person, a big eyesore.  Even after repeated listenings, Trout  Mask Replica has the same effect on the ears.
B00756GRUE|5|I'm happy with my Seiko SSC017 solar dive watch.  I've had some other cheaper watches with a rotating bezel that either were too difficult to turn, or turned too easily making it easy to bump off of the setting.  This one works great, is nicely damped, easy to set but doesn't get bumped off of the setting too easily.  I use the bezel for timing things like food cooking on the BBQ or smoker, since the chronograph feature is more fiddley - you have to unscrew the buttons to use them then remember to screw them back down to maintain their water resistance, and can be pretty obscured if you are timing something for example at 5:30, so the hour and minute hands cover up the minute dial.<br /><br />I was able to adjust the watch strap myself, having already read reviews I knew to watch out for the tiny &#34;tube&#34; piece.  At first I didn't even see it, but fortunately had the watch over a clean surface to be able to find it.<br /><br />I've had a cheaper solar watch before, which the battery died on after only a couple of years so it wouldn't hold a charge, making it worthless, I hope this battery lasts longer than that.
B00K9V2OPE|5|A deep, emotional read that I would recommend for all those romantics out there. Will definitely be reading more stories by this author!
B000FC12C8|4|This is a good book for investors, but personally expected more from the author. In my opinion this book is good for newbies.
B00F8F3J2S|5|Outstanding read and Secretary Gates provides some very interesting insight to the inner workings of the Bush and Obama administrations.  Based on Secretary Gate's descriptions of the Obama administration's decision making, they are clearly amateurs with regard to military and foreign policy...and that's scary.
1416905014|5|Ordered this product for my 2 yr. old great-niece. Eventhough it wasn't seen in hand and bought online, recipients GrandMom, Mom and daughter loved it, were thrilled with it! Arrived on time and in great condition. Thrilled that they were thrilled! :) Very happy the delightful pop-up book brought them so much pleasure. I certainly would recommend it to my friends with children!
0316666343|5|I loved this book...It was beautifully written. I could imagine everything without any trouble and felt that it came from such an interesting perspective (from Susy in Heaven).  I heard about this book from a few people, all rating it very high, according to their standards.  Usually I will not read books that have gotten a lot of hype, that isn't how I work.  Although, I loved the concept, so I read it anyway. <BR>Suprisingly, I finished the book in one day, savoring every last word, hoping that her killer would get what I thought he deserved.  The ending was very good, but I had hoped for a different justice for Harvey. She had an opportunity to tell where her body was and where her killer was, But instead decided to selfishly choose love.  I was a little thrown off at the ending, thinking that she had the chance to put her family at ease at last and getting justice, but I guess that is just what I would have done in her position.  I loved the book nonetheless.  After having read a lot of different types of books, I feel that this is a great original work of fiction and am very upset that I might not get the chance to read something of this type again.  <BR>Wonderful!  The Lovely Bones is original and beautifully written by Alice Sebold.  I highly recommend it to anyone with an appreciation for original and well written work, and anyone with an imagination and open mind.  Don't listen to the hype, listen to your heart.
0374533571|5|I know, I went backwards from the norm and saw the movie before reading the book. I liked both, personally. However, as you read the book, you realize just how much the movie changed parts of the story. I think the book portrays the characters in a more serious, dark manner than the movie, but I think the movie succeeded in making the characters more likeable (probably for the sake of better reviews). The best thing to do is accept both as two different products, and hopefully enjoy them both.
B00IK1NTCW|5|Easy to use!! Appealing to the eyes!
B00PT3AUYO|1|bad
B0058FW1X6|4|Yea!
B000B5XOY8|5|There is no better Batman, yet, than the 1989 Tim Burton version with Michael Keaton. Yes, many objected to Keaton as being used for the Dark Knight role, but he plays it perfectly. He really looks like a believable Bruce Wayne. This 2 set DVD is great for any Batman fan. I love all the extras that are included in the 2nd DVD. It took me about 3 hours to watch them all. My only regret is that there isn't any more behind the scenes info.
B004V9MU86|5|A beautifully written, gentle story about normal everyday German people caught in the violence of WW2. I found it interesting reading about Germans and how living during that time was just as difficult for them as the rest of the world.
B007FG9LIE|4|A very good read with many mysteries to be solved. I will read the next two installments for sure. Great action and stories keeps a good pace.
B000002JSN|5|Excellent from start to finish. Zeppelin's best, and one of the greatest albums of all time.
B00BEIYMIS|5|O my, this is one awesome movie... its was even better than the pre views... but really not for young children.. or those who are afraid of the dark...
B00B7Y0206|1|Why when I try to sign in does everything come up in German. And some of the songs I want to download have German comments I guess telling me I can't get the song. What's up with this? Do I have to uninstall AGAIN and REINSTALL AGAIN?
145162610X|5|Really enjoyed this book.  I had watched  The White Queen on Starz as well as having read the book so this one was a great follow up.
B008UZ7MUI|1|The 3D is not much better than using your TV to convert a 2D. I had this in blue ray 2D and bought the 3D expecting it be be same quality as part 2, it is not. Also picture quality is poor and grainy.<br />If you have this in 2D don't upgrade.
B004SBS8LA|1|This app does not seem to install on droid 2 android 2.2.  Amazon's market app either does not check for compatibility or does a poor job of it.
0307455920|5|Chimamanda is certainly as talented as an ethnologist and anthropologist as she is a brilliant author. Her vision of society and relationships are accurate and written with humor and a unique point of view. And her description of Nigeria is as if you had buy a ticket to Lagos. This is definitely one of her best novel.
B004MC8CA2|5|It is convenient for me to read Bible any time, any where without bringing a paper Bible with me. Thanks!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Absolutely loved it! Satirical yet serious, with an unexpected ending. If you're on the fence about buying it I suggest that you do, it is worth the money!
B000024C7W|5|Love it!
B000JMKQX0|5|Great read. And yes, if you're a fan if zombies then you'll probably enjoy it. But I thought the author did a great job of showing a world devastated by war, pollution, and the depths of humanity. But also the strength of the human spirit to conquer through adversity. The book really makes you consider saving the world we have now. Lest it be ripped from us by shortsightedness and greed.
B000HC2PCM|3|the hag was supposed to have jesus take a hold i couldnt see songs listed i feel like i was mislead
0147515025|4|Bought it for my wife, she is halfway through the first book and she says it is a good read.
B009WO7NQO|5|i'm a big Star Wars fan & this is just a fun!  The main characters as Birds are just funny!
B00005MCWZ|3|Early Hawkwind. Okay if you're of a mind for some classic contemplative Hawkwind dirge-groove but mostly it falls short to my ear. However, the opening track \\"Hurry on Sundown\\" is simply one of their best and for me that alone is worth the price of the CD. There's a bonus version of that same song later in the album but it's only so-so.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I THINK THIS GAME ROCK'S IT'S SO MUCH FUN AND YES WE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR IT TO COME ON THE KINDLE FIRE HD HOPE U GUYS INJOY THE GAME IT'S SO EASY I COULD PLAY ALL NIGHT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN
B005IQZB14|5|I loved this movie. Very interesting.
B007IXWL2C|5|Loved it wish another one would come out. There could be a lot more to this story!!! Great series everyone should read.
B006MW3V6U|5|its taken a good part of the week to get this order filled and shipped;  i use to be able to count on faster service which was one of the reasons i preferred Amazon.<br /><br />This DVD series is wonderful.  Great characters that are beautifully portrayed by talented actors.  And my teenage daughter loves the British accent so we get to spend lots of good family time together watching. Best thing about having the DVD set is we can watch multiple episodes at once and really get a fix!
B0051ANPZQ|5|My 11 year old son recommended this book to me. I first read it through his eyes, but very soon I could not put it down as I was utterly captured by the story. Interestingly, the author uses exactly that approach: from the view of different characters who are all children, allowing the reader to feel that he gets a complete and rounded understanding of all important incidents. Highly recommended, for all ages!!
B005EYP8PO|5|Another album of great songs great Album of songs some of their best recordings that will live with our generation for many years.to come, wish they were still making recordings.
B00M856DSS|5|Love this guy.<br />Love his voice.<br />Crazy lyrics; wish I knew what his message was in some songs, but love it anyway.

1451695195|5|Happened to read this just before my mother unexpectedly died and it helped prepare me in a good way.
B00DPM7TIG|5|A captivating story that winds back and forth through time.  Told with love and grace. Magically written with rich characters.
B00BP0NI1M|5|clear, concise and factual. Ms. Moyo documents her examples well....and makes convincing arguments. Recommended fr  all involved with sub-Saharan Africa.
B00932HEX2|5|One of the most politically accurate thrillers to make it on television. Wonderfully written and acted, and it raised difficult ethical and political issues. Therefore: It got canned.
B000X1Z0BU|5|When you reach a certain age, romantic comedies have no ring of truth to them.  This movie is different.  It is about shared passion - musical passion - shared loss, shared friendship - and unrealized love...because adults cannot usually indulge in love.    This movie acknowledges the pain of love - and still makes you want to go for it.  It is real - and really - what more can you ask of a movie?
0143118420|5|This is an amazing book, I would suggest it to anyone who loves to read.  Also, I would suggest seeing the Movie.  In my case I watched the Movie first then decided to read the book!
B008ZOHCKE|5|I never get to write my own books... now I can! Get it for free. Or get the full version. You can do anything on notebooks.
1401937519|5|The book is meaningful on so many different levels; I really enjoyed reading it.  I applaud Ania Moorjani for writing this book and sharing her experiences and what she has learned.  The world needs to &#34;hear&#34; it.
B00005JOA0|5|Anne Bronte is an early proponent of women's rights.  Although least known of the Bronte sisters Anne seems to be the most intelligent of the three.  This is a wonderful story of a young woman who finds herself locked into a marriage with a very rich abusive husband, her struggles to escape his control & begin again in life as an independent woman.  I would highly recommend 'The Tennant Of Wildfell Hall' to any Bronte/period piece enthusiast
B0025KVLRY|5|The Beatles!
B005RERB92|5|Excellent for children.
B00E9A656K|3|its not what I expected but I kinda liked it. (ten yr old comments)
0307454541|4|Dry at first, but the introduction of the Lisbeth character hooked me. The book is well written with plot points that conclude in an a-typical and therefore refreshing way. The violence is both creepy and cold - suspenseful, but detached and journalistic. This speaks to Larsson's background as a journalist, I suppose. I enjoyed the book, read it very quickly, and will pick up the second in the series.
B0010SKUYM|4|I thought it was quite different from what I expected.  It was different in that I wasn't sure where it was located, what century it was in, if it was of this or an other world.  Some of it appeared to be up to date with modern earth but mostly not sure where and when it took place.  Certainly an interesting read.
B006SAR6P8|5|Amazing suspense- it kept us on the edge. I can't wait for the volume 3. Wonderful cast - enjoy ;-)
B004W2UBYW|5|Walter Isaacson spent more time with Steve Jobs in writing this book than perhaps Steve's own children.  He interviewed many people in Steve's life and tells an honest and fascinating story of what motivates someone like Steve Jobs to imagine and create in ways that change the world.
0452289963|5|I too have not read this book, but was reading through the reviews and came across Corina's review of the previous \\"God\\" review. I am so happy that we are are a point where we can be a part of a spiritual awakening or cleansing (whatever you chose to call it), and not have to have it be a Biblical idea.  There are wonderful people that care about themselves and others that may not live their lives by the Holy Bible.  I intend to buy this book and hope it has the impact on me that it has on so many others.
B00005JM02|5|I really loved Finding Nemo. I see there is a lot of fun extra stuff on the DVD so I'm totally convinced that every kid should see this and I'm sure that the parents will enjoy it also. It is a very good present not only for Christmas but for every occasion - it has humor, heart and a lot of excellent computer graphics which alone is a good reason for viewing this animation. And the vivid colourful underwater world was just breathtaking!
0312370849|3|First, I, like I imagine most readers, had never heard of the Vel' d'Hiv', in which some 4,000 Jews were rounded up in 1942 by the French police and shipped off to the gas chambers.  So, if for no other reason than it highlighted a horrible event, I think the book certainly serves a purpose. The book involves two stories intertwined, one about Sarah a young Jewish girl who was caught up in the Vel' d'Hiv and a contemporaty Julia who is trying to figure out all that happenned. The connection between the two is an apartment in Paris that harbors a terrible secret. I found the story told in Sarah's voice much more compelling and interesting than the one told in Julia's. Julia's story was sort of like The Guiding Light. One of the blurbs on the jacket said that the reader would not forget the story.  I agree. It is a very moving story. However, I was disappointed in the ending after such powerful writing in the body of the book about both Sarah and Julia. Now I'll go read the other reviews to see what other readers thought.
B000QRIGLC|5|A MUST READ  Thank you Marcus for telling this story.  It made me laugh and it made me cry but most of all it filled me with pride.  Oorah Marcus.
0446547654|5|Great book
B001GA1RFA|5|A quirky but wonderful novel that left me thinking about friendship, teen perceptions of society, acceptance and emotional safety, for days.  Mr.Green 's capacity to develop rich characters is one again evident in a story with an abundance of themes that can be simply enjoyed before moving on to the next book on your wishlist, or serve as great material for book groups.
B00NEQRNVG|4|It could use more details. Everything happens so fast with little to no details to back the story up. The struggle between Eva and Cross seems complex but no real substance to define the dynamics of the relationship. Overall a good book, just for me personally I would like more details.
B00GDT5T9Y|5|This is great , I have enjoyed every minute of it. with my grand daughter, I remember watching as a young child.

B00O5HX3ZS|4|The man's output is very interesting. A double cd Psychedelic Pill, single cd A Letter Home, and now another double cd. I'm a fan who has everything--yes even the Geffen stuff and I really enjoyed (5 stars) A letter Home. That said, I liked the solo cd much better than the orchestra cd. I also found this to be true with the Living with War, as I liked the In the Beginning version much better.<br />Look I can appreciate that Neil Young does what ever the hell he wants, as any true fan does, but his excursions into electronica, big band jazz, rockabilly, etc. get away from the natural sound of Neil that I enjoy so much. In other words, the man with a piano or guitar either folkie or fuzzy (with Crazy Horse).
B00AZMFJYA|4|I am a big Star Trek fan and have been since the original series. I did not like the storyline for this movie as much as the first one. It lacked the suspense and excitement of the first one. The special effects were still amazing, though. I was also disappointed that this specific edition lacked any extras. I always enjoy seeing &#34;the making of the movie&#34;, &#34;funny out takes&#34;, and &#34;deleted scenes&#34;.
B004J2TPSI|5|Kokkia A9 bluetooth transmitter is a wonderful product. If your like me you have an MP3 player with thousands of songs. The seamless setup in my car was a welcome change to all of the other products out there that require more work than it's worth, to get them to perform as they advertise. Easy directions to follow, Charge unit, Plug into MP3 player, Wait seconds for linking up, Play music. The next step is to see how easy it will be to link up to my portable bluetooth speaker that i ordered from amazon. I am willing to bet just as easy. Would i tell a friend, Hell yes. I would even go as far is to call them stupid if they didn't buy this product. If they faced the same &#34;I want to play my music in my car, but don't want the wiring all over my car&#34; problem.. The best under $50 bucks i ever spent. HANDS DOWN

B000002LOE|2|It's shameful but not surprising that the album that sent R.E.M. into the  pop stratosphere was their weakest effort to date.  &quot;Radio Song&quot;  is an inept, embarrassing attempt to slow the band's suddenly plummeting  hipster credibility by teaming up with a hip-hop artist.  &quot;Losing My  Religion&quot; is one of the most overplayed and overrated singles ever  (and it's STILL overplayed in 1998 - I can only hope I still won't be  hearing Matchbox 20's &quot;3 AM&quot; ad nauseum in 2005).  The rest of  the songs are similarly mediocre, especially the bland  &quot;Texarkana,&quot; sung by Mike Mills in his flat, nasal voice.   &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; was probably palmed off as a satire of gooey  bubblegum pop tunes, but the result is anything but satirical or clever -  it's just cloying and irritating.  The only high point is &quot;Me In  Honey,&quot; on which Michael Stipe duets with Kate Pierson to wonderful  effect.  R.E.M. would rebound a year later with &quot;Automatic For The  People,&quot; one of their finest records, but &quot;Out Of Time&quot;  marks the beginning of an overall downward slide in the quality of their  work.  Now that Bill Berry has left the band, I've pretty much lost  interest entirely.  His departure should have been an indication to the  rest of the band members that it is time to go do something else.

B00516ZWRE|4|Not that they would ever release anything that would even come close to disappointing their loyal fanbase, but Saxon's nineteenth full-length, 2011's \\"Call To Arms\\" is easily one of their best efforts of the past few years. It is a quintessential Saxon record, showing off the English band's no frills, meat-and-potatoes approach to writing heavy yet always somewhat tuneful hard rock/traditional heavy metal. It has excellent guitar work, catchy vocals, and a very solid rhythm section. And what about strong hooks? Check. And ample variety? Yep. Everything is in place, here, to make this another promising Saxon album, and probably one of the top ten hard rock releases of 2011.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Afterburner\\" and the opening \\"Hammer Of The Gods\\" are blistering cuts bolstered by propulsive, proto-speed metal tempos, muscular, belligerent riffing, and excellent soloing. (The latter also features a strong, grumbling bass line, and memorably big, Iron Maiden-like choruses.) \\"Back In 79\\" takes on a concertedly more mid-tempo approach with hard rock guitar licks, a soaring, shredding solo, and memorable vocal patterns in its anthemic choruses. \\"Surviving Against The Odds,\\" which sounds like AC-DC covering Judas Priest, returns the album to its up-tempo roots; but the next two tracks are more restrained and melodic hard rockers. \\"Mists Of Avalon\\" boasts epic, skyscraper harmonies, crunchy guitar hooks, and deliciously melodic, air-guitar-worthy soloing; and \\"Call To Arms\\" (the song), with its clean guitar strumming, power metal-esque vocals, and wailing melodic solo, is 50% hard rock and 50% power ballad. Next, the very catchy \\"Chasing The Bullet\\"'s rhythmically galloping beat, propulsive, groovy, slapped bass line, and more amazing soloing and memorable, concert-ready choruses, sounds as if it could have been ripped straight out of some long lost AC-DC notepad.<br /><br />\\"When Doomsday Comes (Hybrid Theory)\\" is a catchy mid-tempo march that has nice backing guitar harmonies, ripping, trade-off solos, and irresistible, Judas Priest-y choruses. But the main standout part in \\"Doomsday\\" has got to be its excellent keyboard solo! The Ozzy Osbourne-esque entitled \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\" brings back the familiarly hooky gallop of \\"Chasing The Bullet,\\" but does so in a crunchier, more riff-oriented fashion (it is filled with tough, serrated riffing), and also tucks in a brief bit of acoustic strumming in the outro. \\"Ballad Of The Working Man\\" is highlighted by a steady, grumbling bass bottom, a catchy, swinging groove, and Angus Young-ish vocals -- but it's the guitars that take over again, here, and do so with an impressive array of Thin Lizzy-styled twin guitar leads and piercing, ripping, epically high-flying solos. And the record's second title track, \\"Call To Arms (Orchestral Version),\\" sports orchestral backing flourishes, warm acoustic guitars, supple, Motorhead-inspired crooning, and noteworthy lyrics, thus making it an excellent set closer.<br /><br />Saxon do not disappoint on \\"Call To Arms.\\" This is a very good, extremely solid, eminently memorable, and immensely enjoyable album, even if it is not one that offers many surprises.es, ripping, trade-off solos, and irresistible, Judas Priest-y choruses.

B00004BZ16|5|the clash overreach with this album that shows them moving way beyond the stark punk of their first album, but who cares! way more hits than misses with songs like crooked beats, charlie don't surf, guns of brixton, lost in the supermarket and on and on. few bands could play so many genres (punk, rockabilly, reggae) with such genuine passion and authority. <br /> <br />classic!
B00AE2J5HI|2|Wanted this movie to be better than it was.  Relies on violence to make it compelling.  Fails.  Could have been a good one, just missed the boat.
B007J4T2G8|5|From the moment I began reading this book I couldn't stop.  I never read I don't really like to but I had to see what everyone else was talking about.  I read the entire trilogy in 4 days.  I found myself totally in love with Christian by the end of it.  I would love to read more.  I wasn't ready for it to end....I want more
B005LAIHY0|5|Not a fast pace movie but great tie-in to the Alien's movies.
B00BAXFECK|2|Way too long.  Needed an editor to remove at least 200 pages of carpentry, name dropping, and excessive drug usage.
B002H1J2AO|5|What else can be said, a classic
B00AAL6288|4|Perfect book for beginners.
B00846REIS|1|I´m having doubts about actually finishing this book. The \\"relationship\\" between Gideon and Eva is seriously creepy and messed up. It´s really freaking me out. I liked FSoG and even though I found Christian Grey a bit much at times, Gideon takes the cake.<br />All they do is fight, have sex, fight, have sex. They know each other for like a day before deciding to go to couples therapy, suggested by Eva, who is the embodiment of emotional psycho bitch.<br /><br />This is not a romance novel, at all.
B000I0GGSW|2|Not for those with sensitive ears to profanity. Old movie.  Language a little racy for me.  Enjoyed the plot and acting though.
B000VSAEYI|4|Great kiddy pool i have a 1 and 1/2 year old that just loved it he was runnin up and down the slide it is very durable.
B00CM6ZLG8|1|It was an accident but now I own it. Maybe the grand kids can use to scare the cats so it won't be a total loss.
B00BQ1D91E|5|Not only is the vinyl edition of Infestissumam a throwback to when buying albums gave you large cover art, and lyrics you could actually read...but this baby is pressed on red vinyl. Excellent artwork and typography all around...Ghost made sure this was done right! Then, you get to the music....just a blast to listen to. Reminiscent of 70s Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult. This is an amazing band, both musically and visually. Ghost is the real deal.
B00BVYNSLC|5|So addicting!  Cant wait for the rest of the season
B005ZOBNOI|5|I love this book so much! I've read it so many times and every time I fall more in love with the story of the two star-crossed lovers fight OMG their battle.
0812548094|5|I have ordered the second book in the series.  I was impressed and had a hard time putting the story down.
B0006AAS5G|5|I purchased this watch on a whim as I recently shattered the mechanics of my Tag(I could really be more careful), and wanted a cheap metal link watch replacement. And honestly, for the price point, this watch shines. When i purchased this at $69, I was surprised by the sheer weight of it. It feels solid. The metal links were polished to a high sheen and it looks great, although the middle accent is prone to scratches.<br />Do not expect too much from the glass face as it may not be as clear as more expensive timepieces, but what do you expect for the price? The face is easy to read, and I have to admit, the design is brilliant (being a Rolex homage and all)<br /><br />If you're looking for a cheap dress watch that you are not afraid to bump into tables and doors, this will be great for you.
B00PJ5AUCO|1|It's not downloading on my kindle
1582701709|5|I am japanese.<br />I purchased for studying  english.<br />I think it is good for studying english very well.<br />If there is Japanese translation, I am still good.
B009UX2YAC|5|Very addicting game. Once u start playing u can't put it down. A Good game for all ages to play.
B0089LOG02|4|The story line grabbed my attention and held it to the end. Vivian and Molly's intersection pulls history forward to today. At the same time nothing and everything have changed over a century.
B00EB6F1TY|3|Not bad, same old stuff. But what do you want from action movie? Sit back and watch the action. Did like effects.
B00687PWQG|5|I like this very much ( I am still watching)  The casting and the authentic scenery is wonderful.  Please continue to provide anything regarding history.
B009T9P7OC|1|If I buy it in Amazon, why the hell is checking Google Play for a  licence?<br />After that the adds apear again... Last versi&oacute;n is really bad...
B005ISZRES|4|This book is an old favorite love the old movie and loved re reading about simpler times comforting and enjoyable easy reading with some funny times Happy sad and is good to get lost in am sight impaired and have not long had my Kindle It is fantastic amozon have been great and easy to use This book was one of my first and I am really enjoying the story of The March Family their ups and down and will look forward to reading the next in the series
B00AF6B22E|5|Excellent movie! It made a great gift at a good price!
B00H8C4HZ2|3|The movie itself was good, I am not much of an Oprah fan, well not a fan at all. It was truly a good story line up until the end.  I didn't much care for the Obama theme at the end, it was good up until then. It said to me that the only reason this man and his family voted for Obama was because of his color. That is not how we should chose a leader for our country, but it's their vote.
B003F3FJQO|5|I really enjoyed this book although it is kind of slow in the beginning I still loved it!!
B007MB5OCE|5|That was such an odd, interesting, unusual book! I really enjoyed it - and it in ways reminded me of 'Oh, the places you can go' by Dr. Seuss...! Just keep calm, be open to change & opportunity, and look what might happen! Hilarious in its own way! I loved it!
B00BR4QNJ0|3|WOW. . . this is one of the best apps i have ever gotten. . . i LOVE this app my nehpew loves it i love it and its free you dont have to upgrade a lot of things barely anything i should say i absolutely recommend this app for anyone and any age i suggest you get this app
B006885LZM|5|Well made....
B003NWS5AO|2|I've tried to listen to this numerous times. Quit trying to reinvent the wheel and do what you do best! ROCK!!!
B00GTCECVG|1|Okay, so recently my kindle broke, I had spent over 12 months and 50$ + and when I get my kindle I come to see my account gone I had all lvl 90 legends frustrated I'm. ever playing this app again.
B00DUGCLY4|3|GREAT!&eth;&frac14;&eth;&eth;&eth;
B006G3CFU8|5|An under rated movie. Very entertaining!
B00DPM7TIG|5|I really loved this book.  It was nostalgic, thoughtful, hopeful and beautifully written.  I would recommend to anyone.
B003UPPO2G|3|It would be better if Blueray is available. Audio is acceptable. Packaging not to my expectation. It could have been better.
B0089LOG02|4|I didnt know what to expect when I bought this.  I almost didn't because of the subject.  But oh boy, am I glad I did.  I had no idea of the history of this practice.  It was quite an educational experience.  Even though I found parts sad, I also felt angry on behalf of so many of those poor children.  The only consolation was knowing many were probably better off than if they had been left to try to live on the streets.
B00K03VZ1K|5|Just what I expect from Linkin Park!
B00BUCXVPI|5|Very intriguing, kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen next. Very well portrayed good story.
B000002KE2|5|Black Sabbath:  Vol. 4 is yet another legendary album from the original line-up of Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill.  After the dark, headbanging metal of their third album, Master of Reality, Vol. 4 sees Sabbath return to a more laid-back, groovy vibe, sounding in style, guitar tone, and vocals more like their debut album than either of its two predecessors.  It has more of a rock vibe than Paranoid or Master of Reality, with stronger blues influences.  It's definitely nowhere near as dark in tone as Master of Reality.  Although Vol. 4 contains many throwback elements to their debut, it also introduces some new ideas.  Wheels of Confusion has a tambourine-fueled hippie jam at the end, and Changes was the most ambitious balladry Sabbath had attempted up to that point.  Besides these great songs, Vol. 4 includes several classics, like Tomorrow's Dream, album highlight Supernaut, longtime live staple Snowblind, Cornucopia, the instrumental Laguna Sunrise, and frequently covered album closer Under the Sun.  Without question, Vol. 4 is a must-have for any fan of Black Sabbath or Ozzy.  The fourth release from the most important band in heavy metal history is a keeper.
B002VPE1B6|5|The Plot is great,  a little predictable but that is okay because it is a lot of fun.  The acting is quite good its a long movie but dosent feel so becuase your so drawn into it you dont even notice. Get this Movie. Its the best movie I think of All of 2009 and 2010 to date. If your a Huge Sci-Fi Fan then this movie is a must. If you dont care alot for CG like me, Then this Movie probably will turn the table around for you like me becuase it's the best Most life like CG to date and I mean it looks great.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I love hidden object games, and this one has not disappointed me. I enjoy all the different variations of hidden object puzzles they have, as well as other games, like the blocks and the pipes.
B000001EXR|4|What a shame that at some point someone penned the term \\"grunge\\" to describe this album, and then so many others could find no way to describe it other than using the term.  To me this album is indescribable, but certainly not grunge.  I have been a fan of KISS since the early years, and my musical tastes changed along with the 80's and 90's, I listened to every type of heavy music imaginable, and somehow I cannot see the relation of this album to any Seattle sound.  Definitely a departure from the norm for KISS.  Definitely darker and heavier than Revenge, but I think KISS was at a point when they knew their current lineup was about to disband (Gene and Paul had the reunion planned for years- don't kid yourself if you think otherwise) and they had nothing to lose.  This is purely a stripped down, bare-bones metal album, very introspective and creative, and believe me, it takes alot to impress me musically, but I believe KISS fans of the future will look back on this album as a lost classic, much the way a hardcore group of fans clamor for Music from the Elder today.  I agree that Mr. Simmons rarely does anything without seeing dollar signs behind it, but i think just this once KISS let everything loose and just jammed.  After all, the reunion was a carefully calculated business move to reap more bucks before the band goes out with a bang for good, KISS knew the reunion tours would be successful, and they weren't hurt at all if Carnival of Souls was not a commercial success- as evidenced by shelving it for two years. Just my opinion.
B00008WT49|4|I have to agree with the others - the SACD analog mix in 5.1 was a blunder(4 stars).  I borrowed this from a friend for a test run.  I have the same content on DVD/video - Very nice... - When I choose to listen only - I just turn off the TV and listen to a very good 5.1 DD/EX version.  I admit it is not quite the quality of SACD but very good nonetheless.  Spyro Gyra has 2 SACD's available and they are the standard for SACD comparison - absolutely flawless...  Waiting for 2 of my all-time favorites on SACD - Eat a Peach and Live at the Fillmore from the ABB...  SACD is just a small notch above DVD-Audio - although with DVD-Audio you can also listen on most any DVD player that supports DTS, DD-5.1 and DD-Stereo.  SACD's are more dicriminating - I bought the Onkyo DVSP-800 specifically because of the SACD and DVD-Audio discrete analog and outstanding DVD-progressive scan video capabilities...
0312330537|3|I give this book 3 stars because the first part of the book was good.  The second half of the book started to border on the ridiculous.  The main character is basically a super hero.  He can do everything, everybody loves him, he's just the most awesome person around.<br /><br />If the events in the book were in fact true as the author keeps hinting, it would be an incredible book.  However, since they are not true and he has invented most of the characters, then it just reads like the silly fantasies of a young boy.<br /><br />I bet that a lot of the five star reviews on here are because people thought that the book is true.  In fact, the person who recommended it to me raved about how incredible the story was given that most of it had happened.  Once the storyline started to get ridiculous and the main character basically became a superhero. I started researching the book and found out that the author has admitted that most of the story was simply made up.  The true parts are that he escaped from a prison in Australia and ended up in India.  That's about it.  Even the character of Prabaker is made up!  As soon as I found out the story is almost entirely fiction, I stopped reading. I have no interest in reading how awesome this author wishes he were! There is simply one word for the second half of this book: silly.<br /><br />If the author had reigned in the ego a bit and used some good editors, it would have been a good book. If the story were true as many readers believe it to be, it would have been a good book.  As it is though, I can honestly say that three stars is a gift!
B004VMVTNU|5|I highly recommend this application.<br />I used to get up late. But now, I can get up early.<br />Thanks this app very much.
B00005JNEW|5|This movie is really great if you have never read the book. I would highly suggest watching this first, as the book makes this seem like just another good football movie. Of course that doesn't seem like much of a bad thing, but if you decide to step foot into the realm of true realistic ridiculousness (depression, racism, abuse, love/hate, oil, vicariousness, small town bs, etc), the book will tell a whole different story. Maybe I should just write a review on the dang book! :D<br /><br />This movie really is a good one and a very very true story... down to nearly every word spoken. Buy it, read it, live it, love it, and welcome to the soul and heart of small town Texas... Friday night football.<br /><br />If you do not find this review helpful, please comment as to why. Thank you!
B0055SWM08|5|great game. Challenging, fun, good graphics. Works great on Toshiba Thrive (Go Thrive!) Lots of levels, cool obstacles, easy controls.  no real downside. Just a great game!
B0006AAS5G|5|This was for my husband and he just loves it. Especially since it was much cheaper than on Shop NBC. All that extra money just pays for the fancy box, which we don't need or use.
B008JGSM6G|4|This game has a variety of levels to enjoy. It is not my favorite game, but it is entertaining enough every now and again especially since it was free..
B0012EM5D8|5|I ordered this movie to share with my boyfriend's 25 yr old daughter because she had never seen it.  Bees are crucial to our eco-system and so many people are oblivious to this fact.  These creatures are not to be feared, but worshiped!
B004QX07G4|5|you have to read this book. this has great humor. this is also great for all ages.. this was so worth my money!!
B004ZMWUCU|2|Too simple, too obvious, very sentimental. I do not see which audience can benefit form it. Maybe only the readers of &#34;romance&#34; novels. It is slightly better than these books.
B0001ZXM54|5|All ZZ Top's best songs.Great listening.
B0040IAZVM|5|You must have it! Clara Haskil is absolutely divine! Decca  could have been more careful with the quality of packing the c.d.-s, but the music makes you forget about this problem.
B00HY7VU60|4|Loved it
B00009KM7U|5|This CD is a collaboration of Artists from DNTEL and Death Cab For a Cutie... and together they created some of the best music this era has seen.  If you are a fan of the 80's, emo, or indie or you are open to any kind of good music, one sampling of the album will catapult you into an addiction of these masterfully engineered tracks.  The lyrics pull you into the broken heart of a man and the music will keep you coming back for more.  The tracks contained in this CD are better than 98% of anything that the Mainstream VJ's and DJ's currently expose you too. Don't pass up this marvelous work of art. Its simply amazing
B00DJ735KI|5|An inspiring and optimistic voice in the wilderness of scientific materialism.
B00785P2QC|5|Great game
B00992CF6W|5|You need to get this app
B003O86FMW|5|Loved the book favourite one from the series it will keep you on the edge of you seat the whole time
B00DJFIMW6|4|Love the graphic in the game the games looks wonderful and is very fun to play better then temple run in my opinion but gives it a 4 stars because I had to press menus every time I die to restart the level.
B00992CF6W|5|best game ever!!!!!!! just only wish it had better updates but what can I say mojang does what they do best!  ( I have no clue what that ment)  just get the dang game!
B0027Z9C2I|5|It is one of my favorite all time movies.<br />Would watch it again.<br />Love the music and it is a great love story.
B000002GVO|5|great sound I have the lp and still enjoy that
B00009R6H2|5|Good quality product and works like a champ :)<br />Buy it with comfidence. Wish the shipping cost would be less....
B00GWU65W4|5|I recently added this movie to my library on Amazon.com. Incredible special effects. A very good movie. I've watched this for the 3rd time and see scenes I missed on the previous viewing. I have enjoyed this movie more with every viewing. I very much enjoy Science Fiction as well as action films. This scores very high in both genres. As they say, this one is a keeper :)
0761119752|5|Since he was 2 or 3 months old, my baby has loved to hear us chant this catchy rhyme. Keep a good, steady rhythm when you read it aloud, dance with it or pound the crib mattress to keep time, and it's magic. \\"Pajammy to the left! Pajammy to the right! Jamma jamma jamma jamma P!J!\\" seldom fails to get a baby grin. The pictures of happy dancing animals, like most of Boynton's illustrations, just radiate good feeling. This is too good to save for bedtime (in fact, it's so rousing, parents might prefer to use it earlier in the day).
B007AL48UK|3|dont comment on apps
B00CXLQG0M|4|DISCLAIMER!!  I bought This with the plan to paint it and have my wife use it in a post apocalyptic LARP. this review centers on that.  after checking it out I may get another for me. this is the literal sister toy to the zombie strike nerf gun. now that its in hand I like it more than the z strike version<br />lets start with the good<br />1-the paint scheme is nice! its good looking toy. as opposed to most nerf products, the &#34;nerf&#34; logo is rather small and not raised. for a lot of games / costumes this might work without completely repainting it! and if you do you don't have to sand down any raised logos / nonsense. a big time saver!<br />2- it fires smoothly and good distance, accuracy is ok,<br />3- it has a low profile!, again unlike most nerf pistols its not too big. actually just a little larger/wider than a real gun. so when its in the holster on your hip its not catching on everything, and doesn't have the too big to be real/ goofy look. they literally trimmed off anything that wasn't needed! look at pics of the z strike version and you will see what I mean<br />4- its cheaper than the z strike version....and you get more in the set....like the holster and glasses. its only a few dollars...but for basically the same product im all for less expensive.<br />5- you really can use this one handed without a motor<br /><br />the con side<br />1- the cocking mechanism is awkward, it takes practice to hold the gun right to work it smoothly. if you have small hands this could be a deal breaker. you also have to keep your finger clear of the trigger while cocking the hammer. its  got a hair trigger so when your drawing the hammer down if you hit the trigger it wont lock and you misfire and start the process all over , or shot the dart wild<br />2- the holster is a nice attempt, but its flimsy plastic and wont hold up to running around. with some TLC its got potential.<br />3- its slow....compared the fire rate of the other nerf guns which are all used 2 handed or battery operated motors. in a &#34;fire fight&#34; your at a disadvantage vs the other nerf guns.<br /><br />conclusion- if your looking for a nerf battle gun this isn't it, its too slow to be a contender compared to the other nerf offerings. if your looking for costume accessory, or for a back up gun for a LARP/ game of some kind this is a solid addition! it looks great and can be used with 1 hand.<br /><br />I give it  3 stars for function and an extra 1 for style/looks
B0094K20FK|3|Great to see these actors as I first saw them in the &#34;good old days&#34;.  Good film with more story than explosion special effects.
B004HWYTP4|5|This movie has so many great actors that you just can't go wrong!  I watched it because Red 2 is being advertised.  I want to go see it - but haven't seen the first one yet.  It was action-packed, funny, and had a great story-line as well.  I can't wait to go see the new one!
1603429999|5|I am using this book as a reference, it is comprehensive, well written- an important addition to my knitting library
B007JZGIMS|5|purchasing this extra app is great.  The sound EQ is great!  It has a few surprises like swiping album image to play next song.  Seeing the album image much bigger is awesome.  It’s like going back to vinyl record/jacket days where you can enjoy the artwork of the cover.
B00002E233|1|Many Steven Spielberg's JAWS fanatics may have had a BIG dissapointment with this movie. Why?<br />1)Lame special effects<br />2)Really bad acting....I mean...real bad.<br />3)The plot is amazingly....dumb.<br />DO NOT waste your  time watching this movie. Nevertheless, I'm sure that if you haven't seen  it yet you'll watch it anyway...(I know I did) so by when the movie is over  please remember this review saying: &quot;I told you so&quot;
B00FB13Y74|2|with out a controller this version isnt  easy to do. I have it on my kindle so maybe on a laptop etc., it might be better
B004SBQGHS|5|I love this apt. It makes me angry and happy all in one.  The piggies are funny but the birds make you love this game.
6305428042|4|By now, most people have seen this movie at least once - and likely several times on TV.  I give it four stars only because it was toned down in the scare factor department.  But, then, it's supposed to be fun for kids and adults, so, it's a Thackery Binx whisker away from a five. The movie is imaginative, very good lines and can be seen all throughout the year and not grow tiresome.  Bette Middler does a great job as Winnie, the eldest sister.  A black cat, magic spells and witches riding broomsticks a mop and a vacuum cleaner add to the fun of this yarn set in Salem.  So, enjoy this film over and over - and don't let a virgin light that Black Flame Candle!
B008FYZIVY|5|Downtown Abbey has provided many hours of pure enjoyment and excellent acting.  Looking forward to the next series in the fall.
B005XRUPSC|5|Florence + the Machine can do no wrong. I can't think of one bad thing to say. This is a great album.
B0067RQYNW|5|If I could assign it more stars, I would. Works seamlessly on the Kindle Fire HD. I downloaded it expecting a decent product, but it far exceeded my expectations! Works just as well as Microsoft Office or Open Office, but is also tailored for easy tablet use. Highly recommend getting a Bluetooth keyboard if you will be doing much typing (I use and recommend Bear Motion's kindle case/keyboard).
B004GHBQCE|5|This is just a great CD. Maybe because it was his last one, but there is a real sence of connection between the listener and the singer with this album.
0500516766|1|Was a gift for my husband, he did not like it.  Returned
B00AAW1322|5|As advertised
1250037751|5|What kind of person walks into an apparently deserted, but open, bookstore at 3am? After reading this novel I still can’t answer that. But every new character in this book who walks in and walks back out 15 minutes or so later, leaves you wanting to cry out, “Wait! Come back! I want to know more about you!”<br /><br />If I was teaching a course on novel writing and I wanted a book to show my students the most effective way of producing dazzling characters that grab readers, I would use this one. But first I would have to figure out how Sloan is doing it. He does it so simply, and the result is so readable and magical.<br /><br />As for the plot - Imagine that you’re trying to put together a complex jigsaw puzzle, but with no idea what the final picture is going to be. But the pieces go together so remarkably fast that you can barely keep up. The things you see in the portion you’ve put together are so intriguing that your interest in the final outcome keeps building. The story is like that.<br /><br />One possible explanation for this remarkable book – maybe Robin Sloan is a genius.
B008QTVNUI|5|After listening about this show for several years I finally broke down and ordered it. I was addicted from that moment on. It deserves every award it has received. The cast is superb, story line intelligent.. Can't say anything bad about it!
B00FAPF5U0|5|like it
B00FAI2IUM|5|This was an amazing app. It had amazing cars like the Lamborghini. It was so awesome!!!!This actually looks really realistic.
B00H71PBQ8|5|I have become hooked on Downton Abbey. It is great
B00004TWZK|5|-If you were to take these four boys, modernize them, animate them, and stick them in a small, snow covered town in the mountains, what would you have?-<br />-Stand by Me is the ultimate reflection of the adventures that I would have loved to experience when I was young. I have many tales now from when I was a child, but looking back none would have been able to hold a candle to this.-<br />-Going on a journey through the unknown, with your parent's believing you are somewhere else, to find the body of a young boy your age? Bliss.-<br />-Atleast at that age. Now, as an adult we must ignore our childlike instinct of exploration. How unfortunate for us.-<br />-While hiding under his front porch, digging for pennies that he had lost nine month's earlier, one of the boys named Vern overhears a conversation about a body. THE body. The body of a boy his own age that had mysteriously disappeared!-<br />-His feet can't move fast enough as he runs to tell his friends of what he had just heard. Facing everything in their lives, they gather their stuff and head off into the unknown. Perhaps it was Corey Feldman, but Stand by Me reminds me of Goonies without the skeletons and booby traps.-<br />-During the journey it is soon obvious that what they are after isn't the body, but an answer to mend the fragmented pieces of their past's. If you have had to deal with these problem's you will definately be able to relate.-<br />(All of these four boys grew to be men in many films. River Pheonix and Corey Feldman both worked for Spielberg on Indiana Jones and the Last Cruisade, and Goonies. Whil Wheaton went on to do the popular Star Trek: The Next Generation. Jerry O' Connell has done film's such as Mission to Mars, and Scream 2.)<br />-Stand By Me paint's a picture of childhood in all of it's horror's and triumph's, capturing  the uncertain time before girl's and becoming men. It show's the one last adventure that we all experienced, and makes me remember the days I had.- S.A.O.S.<br />&quot;We may never have friend's like we did in those days.&quot;br />&quot;We may never have friend's like we did in those days.&quot;
B00BRUQ7ZY|5|The fact that so many Christian evangelical/fundamentalist types hate Zealot, despite not having read it, motivated me to buy it.  I figured if it could send them into fits of rage, then there had to be something redeeming in it.  And apparently their disdain for the book is driving its sales higher.  I love the irony!  Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.
B002ZG99TK|5|This has to be one of the best if not the very best railroad movie in many years. The action starts at the beginning and never stops. It is one you will want to see over and over. The first time I saw it I found myself on the edge of my seat and very tense just wondering what unbelievable thing would happen next. The acting is great from all actors and the special effects will blow your mind.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|British TV at its finest
0525951652|5|Excellent read would encourage everyone to read.<br />Starting Winter of the World now.  Looking forward to the 3rd book when released.
B0064MPXFA|4|The cast chemistry is amazing. I find myself craving the next episode. A little bit of something for everyone's taste.
B009IF8CH6|5|For those of us who can relate to this odd group of Nerds, this is the best show on T.V.  I love it, and recommend it to everyone.
B000W7JWUA|5|Okay, the hype is true. I used to think that this game sounded like something D&Ders would play ... but WAS I WRONG! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game! I'm also really good at it, so that helps my love of it. I can't wait to get more expansions and play in different ways.<br /><br />It's all about claiming tiles with roads and towns/cities and gaining commodities to trade to buy/build those roads and towns/cities. It's so easy to set up and learn it's not even funny. I even bought the app on my i-Phone to play alone I love this game so much.
B00ENBS4GO|5|I cannot recommend this enough. If you're not squeamish about blood, and love a good epic, there is none better. The acting is superb and the story is almost obsessively compelling. The breakout star of this is Dan Feuerriegel, who has become my current favorite actor. I cannot wait to see what he does next.  He's just amazing, along with Liam McIntyre, Dustin clare, Peter mensah Pana Hema Taylot and Manu bennet. I discovered this a bit late, but now own the entire series, I can't get enough!!
0694003611|5|Best children's book ever and the board book is great because it's super durable and the pages are easy to turn for little fingers. Highly recommend.
B001NPDCFQ|5|love this movie one of my all time favorites
B000UD08HW|5|When you are a Floyd lover this is a item to set on your wish list.  This kind of music is the classic music for the future.  On Blue ray the pictures and the music are perfect.  The Royal Albert Hall is a perfect place for a party like this.  And when you look at these Blue ray you are a bit there, to join them.  Buy it and enjoy.    A Floyd fan
B001V7UXG2|2|There are no sub-titles or special features, so keep that in mind as you shop!
B001KOFH2G|5|still watching, them  after all these years!<br /><br />recently bought the series in bluray, ... wow!<br /><br />why on earth did the powers that be, cancel this gem after only one season!!<br /><br />buy it.... go on a marathon, watch them all one rainy saturday!
B001IBIHQ4|4|Much has been said about the difference between BoB & The Pacific mini-series'. Obviously BoB had the perfect start up where the series began with training. This allowed the viewer to 'get-to-meet' the cast of real life characters close up. This is essential in any series - the viewers have to connect with the characters. The Pacific writers obviously chose not to do that this time and introduced us to the cast in a drip feed method in between battles. This put the series on the back foot as we didn't really know who we were losing - due to little heart connection.<br /><br />As for the battles themselves - The Pacific theatre was unique. Unlike Europe, where Patton could attack, meet resistance, shift direction, force a hole, outflank, breakthrough and fan out - in the Pacific, most of these battle tactics counted for zip. There were few lulls in the battle, precious little cover and an intensely humid tropical environment - it was no holds barred kill or be killed until every enemy was eliminated. Where US Forces retreated and regrouped in the Battle of the Bulge, the US Marines & Army could only retreat into the sea.<br /><br />And the enemy was vastly different. Where the German soldier was exceptionally tactical & clinical...the Japanese trooper was fanatical. There has been plenty written about their battle code so I won't repeat it here. The Clint Eastwood film \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" best describes the Japanese experience from a personal level.<br /><br />I recommend you watch this series without all the distracting ads and see it as a good visual history lesson. Hopefully it'll be our last World War!
B00C0W08XK|5|I have played many versions of sudoku on my phone. This one is the best so far. The user interface is intuitive and easy to learn. You can set it for helps or not.
B00AEBB9SM|4|Been a long time since I had seen it. Was fun to see again.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5|Asphalt 8 a is the best racing game I<br />have ever played. Even though it takes a while to load it's worth the wait. It's also very addicting to play. I just can't stop!
B00IX9UTLU|5|This trilogy is addicting. It was written quite well. If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey you will love this trilogy. Great trilogy!
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Exciting, suspenseful, wonderfully written. All the loose ends are neatly tied up by the ending.  Nothing leaves you wondering..what happened to the?
B003K15IF8|4|Beautifully crafted elegy to what was only ever an ordinary life....some of the prose so well wrought it bounded on the poetic.
B004WKOCP8|1|Dear Incubus:  I really wanted to like this album with every ounce of energy in my body. I even listened to it 10 times today and still don't get it. You were supposed to resist and multiply...
B0000084J7|5|This is an incredible album, and gets better with repeated listenings.  Personally, I make quiet time in the dark and watch out windows while listening to this - so, it takes patience to adapt your ear to it, even as a fan, but it's well worth it in spades when you settle in to it.  Great piece of work - we need more like this from Hollis.  He's a genius.
B00H3NPER6|4|Great movie..just a bit on the silly side but great nonetheless
B00079ZACM|5|Excellent choice for my husband!  He lives this film with the original cast...the best!!  I would recommend it over some of the newer versions.
B001DUGOWY|5|Excellent story telling - as I would expect.
B004289ZW0|5|Extremely easy to use, accuracy as advertised, unit locked on quickly and paired in seconds. It's tiny, well made, and has universal mini usb charging. What's not to like?
B0096DZKZC|3|Fun game, but the controls are very difficult on a phone. Maybe if they recommended a controller or worked on the controls I would give it 5-stars. Bravo continuing classic Sonic style games.
B00JMI3KSU|1|What a horribly boring movie.
B00HGJ18C2|4|This game is really really good except for all the pop up ads between each game. Very annoying.
B005PYZG6E|3|I would say invest a little bit more money on a glidecam or slidecam if you have a dslr. This stability gadget is probably only good for compact cameras. Shipment came very quickly, that's the 3 stars are for =)
B008JGSM6G|5|i luv this game but i hate the updates they take 4ever so b4 u get this think about the updates otherwise this game is awesome peeps of da world!!!!;)
B000817YF0|5|Awesome awesome great great sweet intense ambient progressive perfect soul shaking kick ass muka lukin bad ass album!!!! Love it
038073186X|4|I don't want to give away anthing about how this book plays out. But I do want to add my accolades to the many others already here. Lehane is a brilliant writer, and this is a gripping thriller. It's also a risky endevour. It's not a traditional crime novel, and it certainly doesn't hinge on the regular sort of bad guy, good guy stuff. As I got near the end of this and watched the main character struggle for truth I was totally with him. I was struggling too. That's the thing - Lehane manages to create his main character so well that you end up just as conflicted and troubled as he is. But then when it's all revealed it all makes sense and you can see the threads that Lehane wove in all the way through, right back to the first scenes. This book is that good, that carefully written.<br /><br />It would be a lot easier to write this review if I could say more about the plot revelations toward the end. I can't though. But do believe me, this book is worth your time.
B00008DDSC|5|Enjoyable movie. Well acted, I recommend this video
B008MEM24S|5|Free game that my children/children downloaded thanks for keeping them busy on car trips and during downtime thank you so much...
B004LOMB2Q|5|I love evernote, the problem is that I forget to use it :) Every I need to jot down a quick note it's my favorite tool, mostly because I like to record an audio note that I can reference later.
B005LAJ212|4|Love the Hamptons.  what's not to love?
B000JMKQX0|4|This book is highly entertaining and was cleverly written. Multiple stories come together to form a compelling, complex plot. I recommend it for all fans of zombie literature.
B009K0OL06|5|My Family loves this show.  We rented it so other members of the family could get caught up do date with the series.
