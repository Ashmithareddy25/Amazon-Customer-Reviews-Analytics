B0072ONV3K|5|They fit perfectly on my 2002 Shorelandr Boat Trailer with 2 inch X 3 Inch Rectangular Tube trailer.  If you did not know differently you would think they were the original ones.  I am very satisfied.
B00LUS2PUE|4|Arrived exactly as described.  Well finished.  Required only minor trimming around the base.
B001EGT3I4|5|Make these things last forever.  Remove the ABS  sensor and pump it full of grease. Mobile 1 Syn. Do this and the will be the last hubs you buy.  Once a year. Just dont blow out the seals. New one will take a lot of grease because they don't put to much in there at factory.
B009G5ERVS|5|The price was great and they were what I needed. Shipping was fast.
B004W0QISM|1|misleading ad does not stick to all upohlstery
B00KGT9IUS|3|Can't see it good in day light, night time is real nice.
B0066QTZEE|1|This is part does not work according to the mercedes dealership.
B00EHIPQ1E|5|So far they re working great i ve order 8000K and they look excellent and operate fine..no issues!
B00M1HUL9K|4|Pricey, and a bear to put on my Honda Ridgeline truck wheel, but once it's on, very comfortable,. especially with the puffy cloth sides.
B000N56KLA|5|Very quick delivery, product as described
B00K0QCKDO|5|great price and the OEM ones only last a couple of years anyway. This one is working so far
B00K7X92BI|5|Fit my 2011 Honda Civic perfect!
B000HUOKH2|5|As Always, FelPro gaskets are just dandy.
B002PCFYN4|5|works great
B007SWVA2U|5|Very durable. Did not curl.
B007USE1M8|5|good product
B00KAVGUFS|5|They work great but the directions to sync them are horrible almost impossible!
B0039Z5TYU|5|Product functions as advertised.  Reduced temperatures where applied and adhesive was adequate
B002R0QS6G|5|The products fits prefect and good quality.
B00155237W|5|Item was as described and shipped timely
B005SFXPKO|1|Will open the door, but not actuate the ignition. Wasted dollars.Ended up paying the dealer an outrageous fee for a replacement key plus the cutting charged by a locksmith.
B00657SFPE|5|There's not a whole lot to say about this. I was looking for a quality applicator and this exactly what I needed. Works great with wet application and flexed just enough to get into contours.
B00VRQ79SC|4|the part was easy to install and had no problems since
B002Q1LIV6|5|These are amazing. Just had a bbq yesterday and everyone wanted to know where these were from. The set is a good size and combo of shapes. I would buy these again for sure.
B00TR94696|5|They look great, and are simple to install.
B004ZBD69M|1|does not fit properly tried to return them but missed the return day by 1 day<br /><br />They also go shipped late from Amazon
B00NP41YB2|5|Fit perfect
B000BL10WU|5|Just what I needed. Fast shipping
B000BN858K|5|Thank you so much for making my order right this time . Now we're some of that goodies you could provide for free for all my purchases :)
B00CZCY5SE|5|LED light for 12 volt system use it in my camper and it works very well
B0001L0DFA|4|Very nice nozzle.  I am surprised how well I like it.
B00JIEX722|2|I've installed these lights in my HONDA Accord 2015 lx, for some strange reason one of the bulbs short circuit the rear park lights... but they are super bright...
B00NI9JQTQ|4|Very good product, good fit work well.
B0040CVV4I|1|Plastic is too brittle!!!! Have to make sure that you put the two pieces together just right so the clip will not break. Poor design or wrong plastic used!!!
B000BWCFT6|5|Quality Teflon tape.
B00HCPI03A|5|very good like the picture
B006BDWM4C|3|They don't always work, but it worked just fine for me. Thanks!!
B000CSOI2G|5|yeah, so its a condenser.
B00HXC40SG|5|While a bit time-consuming to install, they work great!
B0052SF0LO|5|everything seems good
B00PKJ7FGI|5|Just what I wanted :)
B000VAQLXE|5|Worked great on my 2001 Honda civic
B00CFBV7L8|5|perfect fit
B00873J0YY|5|We'd only been using 2 cross bars and the kayaks never fit right, moved around and we're very noisy. The first trip with the J-bars was fantastic, now we don't have to constantly check if the kayaks are moving and everything is very quiet. 5 stars, 0 complaints.
B00V5OTZL0|1|has crackly sound unit wouldn't work properly
B004MDW9C8|5|Love it, thanks!
B00157TGXY|5|I Love this item. I have lived in my 5th wheel for 6 years and use it every time the tank is emptied. We do have a small crack in the top of tank due to extreme cold weather, so when it gets to full, it can smell horrible. This takes that away fast. I have even used it when there has been clogs and backups, gotta love when the grandbabies come over and load the toilet with a roll of toilet paper. A few really tough clogs, I just put one down the toilet and waited several hours, BOOM, cleared it and saved a fortune on a plumber. I highly recommend.
B00MEVO5U4|4|They look super cute but you can tell they are of cheap quality!!plastic!!!
B002OUMVWY|5|It's the part of rving nobody likes! But with the Rhino Flex hose I feel better doing the dirty work. It locks securely into place and if I'm to far away it usually can extend to the hook up.
B00AKW24BG|5|Great!
B000IYE35Q|3|I replaced the front struts on my 2007 Saturn Aura XE and decided to replace the rear shocks at the same time since I was going to do the front. These shocks are surprisingly spongy compared to the OEMs i took out. What a difference and not in a good way. Feels like the rearend is going to bounce off the ground on bumps. It's a little unsettling taking curves in the hills. Should of stuck with OEM replacements. Wish they felt safer.
B00B9FEBSW|4|Worked perfectly! Would recommend anytime!
B009FUF6DM|5|Ok towels
B001BK6HFU|5|Some one side swiped me.  This was a great oem replacement for half the cost of the part at the auto store.
B0058WXNOK|4|I did mine a little different from the instructions with good results. My kit came with a extra empty container to mix paint. I first trimmed up the torn area on my Toyota Tundra leather gray seat with a razor blade. I took the glue and filled in the hole. I used a hair dryer to dry the glue quickly. I didn't have time to wait 4 hours for the glue to dry. I then would press the glue in with my finger. I would add more glue to make the whole level with the rest of the leather. Next I mixed my paint. I kept adding black to the white until I was satisfied of the color. Instead of heating up the tool that was supplied , I used the hair dyer on the paint too. Just before it was dry , I pressed in the grain paper to give it texture. I then finished drying it with the hair dryer. To finish , I dipped my finger in the paint and rubbed it around the hole to blend the repair area with the rest of the seat. You can barely see the repair in the grey seat photo that I uploaded. It is on the bottom right side. Be patient and have a wet rag handy in case of a mistake.
B001UL4ALS|2|On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being outstanding I would give this tool a 3.<br />This is advertised as not only being able to install a PEX crimp clamp, but remove them also.<br />The jaws are just too soft to use this tool for removal.<br />It will install a clamp just fine, but do not count on it to remove a clamp.<br />I tried and the jaws are so soft that I now have notch in the jaws.<br />Use another tool with hardened jaws to remove a PEX crimp clamp.
B00NGZ5SLM|5|Perfect fit on my 2010 Ram 1500.
B00K2G5I40|5|Fits great in my Rav 4! I get a ton of compliments, and it keeps the car noticeably cooler.
B00FJ0TP4S|4|Worked great for what I needed it for, the hooks on it can be moved to make securing your items an easier task, and it stretches real good around larger cargo,  it was raining the day I loaded up, so I used this to secure the tap in place to keep my cargo dry,  it was perfection. .....very good buy for the price. ...
B002C7DSIK|5|works as expected
B004RCQT98|5|Have only used the tow bar once. No complaints. Order was delivered on time. Satisfied with product and service.
B00IY277AW|5|great price & factory fit
B005NJON74|5|This looks so very great on my car. And my doxies think me for buying things that they can relate with.
B00O86R6C2|5|just what I had expected.
B00D2QL0DU|5|Works awesome
B008H3YKL2|3|We bought this for a custom golf cart. Although I really do like the design  and look with the protection cover.  Ours was a challenge. It was installed and wired in and we experienced severe power drain and short circuits. During dis-mantle of entire electrical routing, we noticed there was power on both sides of terminals even with no fuse.  We ended up cutting the LED circuit board out of the device to make it functional.  From this point forward it has been great.  Glitch in manufacturing I guess or I got a Friday one.  LOL&#62;
B00RM327NG|5|Such a simple idea. I love that my phone is in my view and stays but with out having to mount to windshield or put adhesive strip on my dashboard. Another plus the A/C blows on battery to keep cool.
B004ADUN00|3|Nice lights but I got the wrong ones first order... had to reorder the correct ones, and they're exactly right! Nice to be able to see driving at night :)
B00OB59CU4|5|:) super awesome
B004UM6DLE|5|This stuff is awesome! I freaked out after getting my SUV detailed when I realized that I had tiny little rust spots on top of the paint all over the car since I'm trying to sell it! I thought that was the end of it until I did a little bit of research and found Iron X! This stuff is like magic. Took two or three coats to get it all off but it doesn't take very long at all. Then when you are finished just wash it off with water and comes off like soap. One minor caveat...the stuff does stink like death like others have said. Especially when you take a big wiff of it out of curiosity. Other than that I highly recommend this product!
B00E1TNZUS|5|I have a '92 Vmax with a stock carb setup.  The slip-ons are as pictured and sound great.  Everything required for the installation was included and I was finished within an hour upon removal of the stock cans.  I've had the bike for about 8 years now and have put close to 40K miles on it.  These slip-ons do not in any way exhibit a reduction in performance and the carb setup is still stock.  If you're looking for a fantastic sounding muffler, I recommend these 100%.
B00FPJKO66|3|good
B000E5W9P0|5|Great filter.
B000S2U6QI|4|This antenna base has a male M7 X 1.0-7H stud that accepts AC Delco antenna mast 22876544.  AC Delco antenna mast 15087886 WILL NOT FIT. As far as replacing the base on a 2005 Silverado, the base is easy to get to and to unfasten the screws, but the antenna wire enters the passenger compartment from the engine compartment from a very small space.  In the passenger compartment the wire enters up above the blower motor and you cannot get your hand up in there to route the wire through or secure the grommet. You can access the antenna wire to radio connection next to the blower motor. I found it easier to buy AC Delco extension 25706701 and run it through a hole I have in the firewall for accessory wires and connect it to the radio that way.
B004K7F91O|5|love it
B00R1FXNGA|5|I placed this alternator into a 2003 Chevy Silverado in about 8 minutes.  It was very easy and fit perfectly.  The higher amp output than OEM alternator is great.
B001KQD7RQ|5|Got it quick, easy install and works great. Great product and service. Thanks
B00R07F8PS|5|Avoided the whole recall issue. Works great
B00MB0D9G4|5|Color march with my 1998 MB C230 interior including wood trim.Great looking product.<br /><br />Tony<br />Virginia Beach,VA
B00138FAMQ|5|Great license frame. Been on my car in South Florida for more than a year with no signs of pitting or corrosion yet. I can see how that could be an issue in the Northern climates when exposed to road salt, but down here we have no such problems. I especially like the fact that all the screw holes are covered. Why look at ugly screws when you have a nice chrome frame. And those little round covers don't do the trick. The integrated covers with this frame are a nice touch.
B00CFXJYNE|4|hasn't faded, been 3 weeks. heavy steel with chrome plating. Cute on my truck.
B004BHZR1A|2|Cheap-looking and feeling.  Whatever.
B00TZ5Y67O|4|Installed these on my 6 X 10 Utility Trailer, very easy to install being surface mount type. They are bright.<br />Mine the White is Ground, Red is Signal and Black is Tail lights. You have to figure your wires out as they come with no code for the wires. Otherwise they would received 5 Stars. Make sure you have a good Ground, if not it may cause your Tail lights no to come on, This is what I ran into, once I made sure I had a really good ground, all my lights worked just fine.
B00ZGUDTXE|5|Very nice..
B004RCRS9I|4|Great brush and with the side brushes I don't have to worry about banging the hard plastic bracket into the trailer.
B005N53C9I|4|looks cool
B0002STR22|5|These worked good while paint a room with a paint sprayer.
B00ZZO0448|4|Arrived on time. Seem to be same brightness as 1003 bulbs but burn much cooler
B0002U2V1Y|4|Although it does make the paint look amazing and feel super smooth, it will not remove tree sap. Instead it spreads  it around and makes it look far worse than before.
B000NOQTQC|5|woerks great fantastic price!
B00XK772MO|4|Good cover that matched the interior of my Colorado pretty well.  It was a struggle to put on though as it fits VERY snugly.  Once I got it on though I was confident it wasn't going anywhere.  It's a good way to protect my console from getting scratched up though so I'm happy with it so far.
B0012TZ04E|5|Nice balaclava. A year ago, i bought an Under Armor balaclava, with all of their marketing things adviced, it was about 25 bucks, and i can assure you this works as good as the expensive one. Really nice to use on the winter bike rides!
B007XBANOW|5|perect.. exactly like stock.
B00VNPOH1E|1|Rinestones already missing. Yellow not gold.
B00AX03E2I|5|Really nice
B005O0ZEG6|4|Great product to protect your car and items at the same time...just not the best price.
B00NDCIPVI|4|Great tool
B001C6Q8PM|4|I was missing one light on my license plate and bought this to replace it. This is not the same quality as OEM, but it's just a license plate light so i think it is sufficient.
B000EVWDU0|5|Before trying this device for it's intended use I compared it's reading against precision bench DMMs and found the measurement within +/- 1 least significant digit of the precision meters. For automotive or RV use the error is essentially of no consequence. I am using this to check the charge condition of my camping trailer and the output state of the solar array connected to the camper's battery. As a tech type person I don't care what the color LEDs are doing because the actual readout is far more useful, there aren't enough stages of LEDs to be terribly useful as condition indicators anyway, batteries and their charging systems have far more subtle variability than a simple 3 light green/yellow/red indicator can indicate.
B00Y5HHX1S|5|very good like the picture
B000GV4TIW|5|This regulator is more than I expected.  Combined with the 22 amp cycle electric stator it keeps my battery charged to the max.  I am very satisfied with this product..  Kudos
B000C9OEHO|2|This fan belt failed within 6 months. And by failed, I mean 2 of the 5 bands tore off and ripped in half.  Some permanent damage to the fan shroud and fan itself.  Never had this happen before.  Very concerning.
B001O074JU|5|good power and mileage
B000Q6SL2W|5|Worked excellent once I figured it out.
B00MOQXJ9C|4|Yes, finely a Solid Bad @** quality Ratchet!
B00BEKR27E|5|As described and fit well. However being a different chrome then the rest of the car the standard chrome one may have been a better option. Installed on 2012 Genesis sedan Rspec
B00G1Y2ZRU|5|Good quality for the price.  Arrived in a shorter time than was stated.  You will need the brass bushing from your original clutch lever for it to work properly without any slop.
B00QNUO7FK|5|great product
B00KWLD4RS|5|Great
B0031HQW9M|5|Perfect!
B004AY3NHE|3|Two of the three packs I bought seemed old...and not sticky.  The last one was great.  Of the two &#34;old&#34; ones, one has already started falling off.  Possibly Something I did wrong, but I followed the instructions.  Just seemed like it didn't have enough resin.
B00B7QENXQ|5|Perfect.
B007HRVQ8O|5|It fits and it works.  Now I hope I will never have to use it.
B000C2ACOA|5|ITS SIMPLE  ITS FEL PRO , I HAVEN'T MET A MECHANIC YET THAT WONT USE A FEL PRO
B00HJB532I|5|Perfect fit
B00DLMNWB8|5|Great lights came well packaged
B001G7TV38|5|Perfect!  Great product, great price.
B0063CU6GM|5|Beautiful protection and easy to install!
B000C55SVE|1|Eyelet snapped off on a trip to Kentucky. Bad weld maybe
B0031IBS4A|5|Worked great on my 2008 GMC yukon
B00FDOQ3D6|5|Perfect fit, comfortable and very easy self install!! Shipped quick and great price!!
B00R7JJ7RE|5|I orderhrome olated for Jeep Patriot limited and not for Toyota RAV
B001JK0Z28|5|First time I used this product. It was simple to use and made a great new threads.
B007MNUAXU|2|Only works about half the time
B00068XCQU|5|works perfect
B00I4CLY6A|4|This is a very nice piece of plastic with a straight edge
B0130J3KSQ|5|VERY heavy duty. Great product. I placed it on my headlight control arm. Easy and universal install.
B00JM5ZC70|4|Great product<br />Would order again<br />Only gave 4 stars cause the instructions<br />Were garbage. Thank you youtube.
B004SL8568|5|Works perfect for my Lexus. Always use Toyota Genuine.
B000C541D0|5|Fits my 97 accord just right! Built looks and feel sturdy! First time I run into problem with amazon, they sent me 2 passenger side of item, got to return one and re-order.  The re-ordered item came on time while I'm doing the change out.
B0002KNZL4|5|works great for the money
B00PTPT62Y|5|works as it should
B00COXVNNO|5|Works 100% good with... Chevrolet spark 2014, Hyundai accent 1996, Volkswagen Jetta 2000, Audi A4 2003, Mitsubishi eclipse 2003, highly recommended. Using my Amazon kindle fire.
B00FBKUK22|1|Do not purchase!<br /><br />I had issues with connectivity from the moment of installation and a complete ballast failure within 24 hours. It's cheap for a reason.
B00CHDGMJQ|4|It fit perfectly. Wasn't painted, so I brought the matching spray color with the clear coat included. Sprayed and waited 48 hrs to install. Now, the fasteners weren't included but I brought a ok from the local auto supply store for 3$. But it's a good buy all in all.
B000OQIGA6|5|Never get your  hands dirty again.<br />Ideal for lawnmowers and snow blowers.<br /><br />Order the larger version for car and large<br />tractor oil changes. Works great!!!
B000E7WLJW|4|Took it for 1500 miles, and works GREAT.  Can store so much stuff in this, and didn't have any moisture inside.  It expands another few inches for even more storage if needed.
B00F4HU0FO|5|just what was needed...fits perfectly...packaged and delivered very good
B00496VHF8|5|Very professional,won't be disappointed.
B000HAXLZO|5|covers well, dries quickly, and makes adhesion a quick task.  Not much else to say, this is a great primer/surfacer. In a can, SEM is my go-to.
B00MMQRIHI|3|I had to return it due to a small dent that kept the tip from fitting properly.  Also, unless you know what you are doing already and can attach it yourself, the instructions were grossly inadequate.
B00GRSOJSS|4|I'd would give it another star if it game in a flat container or something that would allow you to just drop the tools in. This would be helpful because you can reuse the product a few times. The product itself did an Amazing job, took off all the rust and didn't hurt the tool. I will probably use this for years to come.
B001INN5MI|5|Perfect size for back or side window, showing how much your a true fan. A must for all fans of the foos!
B00M6RNQNI|3|Awesome when they work.  I mounted them in the bottom of my hard saddlebags.  Lots of compliments but one was defective right out of the package.  The other one went bad a day after installation.  I'm working on getting a replacement from the company.  We'll see what happens now.
B00OQ1F7PM|4|I just mounted these in my boat one for the trolling motor and one for the boat battery, they are small and compact as well as waterproof, we will see how they do with charging the batteries. that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. Had I known earlier they had a 6 amp version I would have went that way.<br /><br />Just purchased my third unit, these work very well and I not only have them in my boat but also mounted in a couple of my cars. I have a few cars and only drive them on occasion so I just plug them in and have no issues with dead batteries when I have not used a car for a couple of weeks. I was having battery issues because with all the thief stuff on the cars it remains on while your car is sitting and will in time drain the battery, so now I just plug them in and have no more issues, I really like these trickle chargers.
B008Y5AO40|5|This is the best bag you'll ever find to put on your trunk. With lot of room and convenient zipper pockets.I just did a 3000 mile trip with it and it performed flawlessly. With that being said, it fits a standard luggage rack, it will work with the Harley air wing but I chose to change out my air wing to a standard rack for my trip.
B0046DQTQQ|1|The pink rhinestones faded now I have one line of pink and the bottom all yellow
B000CKR1SW|5|This Condenser is the updated version that is offered by Chrysler/Jeep as a replacement. It came very well packaged, fit like a glove. The new design improves the performance of the A/C substantially, and at less than half the price of the dealer price, it was a great purchase. By the way, SPECTRA makes condensers and evaporators for a number of car companies including Chrysler.
B003S6IDP2|5|Great
B003U4O414|5|helps to quiet a noisy motor. Cheaper here than your local parts store. Recommend for a high mileage vehicle or to extend life in new motor.
B00JEQLHF8|2|The sizing is a bit small, compared to other brands. The head shape also seems to be different than many others I have tried. My wife and I have owned at least 20 helmets between us and we both found these uncomfortable.<br /><br />The bluetooth is not easy (or intuitive) to sync up, but once linked, it does have good range. I can talk with my wife when I go in to pay for gas. One drawback is, you cannot talk (intercom) and listen to music (alt. BT source) at the same time. You have to switch back and forth by pushing the button on the helmet.
B0049ZIUQI|5|Perfect fit.  Just what I needed.  The price was right too. The dealer quoted me a price five times that which I paid.
B00247K7FK|4|[[VIDEOID:848d44445ed7db908ee33c276d424bb0]] Let wind in a little much above 55mph, but much better than sunglasses. would buy again.
B000CQDKFE|5|I liked the way it looked but didn't use it.
B00IIWJLO8|5|Item as described, fit perfect on my 2007 Lincoln Mark LT
B004HII1G6|5|Very pleased with this product
B007A3TYI4|5|MY HUSBAND WAS VERY HAPPY TO GET THIS.  GREAT SERVICE.
B00513G82U|5|I LOVE IT THANKS AMAZON but next time dont grapped when yes painted little marks on outside but no big deal i polished and come out a littlebit
B00EI8I7SC|5|Perfect fit for my 04 Mazdaspeed Miata
B00YNKDTWO|5|These plates frames are quite attractive. I needed something that would replace my dealership plate frames since I am moving to a new state....I didn't want to keep advertising their name and number. My car is silver so I was looking for something that would add a nice accent and not be too over the top. The plate frames are easy enough to install...I didn't even need directions for this one. They also come in a nice box capable of storing your old or an alternative set of plate frames. Very sleek and classy....I would say simple elegance describes these.  DISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discount in exchange for honest and unbiased feedback.
B00H8DFKS4|1|Installed them on 2012 Ford Raptor. They didn't even work!  WASTE OF FRICKIN MONEY!!!!!!!!
B001EJRGYE|5|It works. It doesn't leak. It fits in the space. And all movable parts are replaceable. Good for girls to sit on but hard for guys to use standing
B00RNI79AQ|5|This a Good Product, with good customer service. I had the keys cut at my local key shop.  I use these guys a lot and I would not take these blanks to some place you do not know. You cut them, you own them. You can buy on line the 16pin scanner cable and software to program them.
B002G38WLI|5|great
B009CHQF3I|5|great!
B000A8FJ12|5|great stuff for a 40 year engine
B008YFTB4E|2|Don't waste your money on these lights. . Unless there was something wrong with the ones I received.  Wouldn't stay on for more than 4-5 minutes.  Even bought the harness for them but still no luck.
B00030DLEE|5|perfect gift for my trucker son.  He can now eat actual meals without the cost of restaurants.  Works like a dream, heats up cans nicely in about 30 minutes, meals you can cook while driving (though once the smell hits you, you're going to be hungry!)
B00KLIWMCU|1|Piece of s***. Better off using a piece of foil.  The side flaps are loose. Don't buy it you'll regret it dude.
B00FV1MMT0|4|Easy to install and fit pretty well.
B00IDHUQWY|5|A GREAT TOOL! Now I can do two struts in a quarter of the time! And I feel safer!!
B000LG5ZM6|5|Works wonderful
B0056JC02Q|5|Made of high quality material.  I would buy from this company again!
B0067EEZPE|1|These pads are garbage.  Miss shaken and squeal like crazy.  The pads come from poor quality control as the ends were not tapered correctly.  1 pad wasn't tapered at all on one end.  Would not recommend purchasing as the seller did not warranty the pads with less than 200 miles on them.
B00BDVM8P0|4|received on time.  Had to trim nylon leader to fit
B00K87V0T0|5|GREAT PRODUCT - GOOD FAST SHIPPING - GREAT AFTER I MOVED THE METERING ROD ADJUSTMENT E CLIP DOW 2 NOTCHES -  SELLER NEEDS TO PROVIDE A PARTS DIAGRAM TO INDICATE THAT THE THROTTLE METERING ROD IS ADJUSTABLE - MY CARB HAD A &#34;FLAT SPOT&#34; JUST ABOVE IDLE SO I MOVED METERING ROD NEED DOWN 2 NOTCHES FROM FACTORY SETTING OF 1 NOTCH DOWN FROM TOP - IT WAS TOO LEAN JUST ABOVE IDLE FOR MY YFM250 - HAD TO MOVE IT DOWN 2 NOTCHES - PROBABLY ONLY NEEDED 1 NOTCH - BUT IT IS SUCH A PAIN TO TAKE TANK OFF - I MOVED IT 2 - WILL PROBABLY MOVE IT BACK UP 1 NOTCH
B00YHY10XQ|5|Look and works Great thanks
B000EDOSNI|5|Works like a charm. Worth the money
B00JV7RBPA|5|Love it but wish it were bigger
B00JRFMKBG|5|Received on time and looks exactly the same as it does on the website. Completely satisfied.

B009RC2HVC|5|great fix
B00ZZO0448|5|Easy plugin product works great.
B000HUQACU|4|Great product
B000CMHVG2|5|Only used it a couple times but works as described and seems to be well made. The illumination is definitely helpful.  I'm happy I made this purchase and would recommend it to others - best of all, you can't beat the price.
B00MYHE13Y|5|It is just the right size and price
B00HIVHG6K|3|They looked like they are good but they didn't fit my Jeep Grand Cherokee. When you are ordering them make sure that your stock/current  front rotor is 13 3/4&#34; in diameter and not 13&#34; (like mine) and make sure your rear rotors are slotted not solid. If they are 13&#34; and solid then order kit # K5952 instead. Don't make the mistake I made.
B00UKSG3JO|5|I had to modify the sockets on my factory lamps, as the new sockets ( larger hole) seem to be for newer vehicles, mine's a 95 Astro, not a problem, and the panel looks so sharp.
B00139YMUQ|5|Excellent tire pressure gauge. I have used it for two years now, and I have bought others, but I keep coming back to this. Well made, feels like high quality materials are used, and super accurate. The gauge seals well when you push it into the valve, unlike many other gauges.<br /><br />For those who complain about the psi/bar settings being changed, here is how (and it could not be easier).<br /><br />-Press and hold the ON/PROG button for a few seconds, then use the up or down button to select if you would like psi or bar. Press ON/PROG to confirm selection.
B000EQ83I6|5|Worked great
B0009H50VS|5|Great quality.
B00MJDXC24|1|Not a great fit on the windows and the sunroof piece not at all. I bought the five piece package for the price was equal or less than other four piece buys , so the no-fit is not is not a great loss.
B000S2Q3J2|5|perfect fit.
B004BRJZWC|5|1 st class
B00J4D518U|5|Outstanding Product.
B00O3GS3QK|4|Exactly as advertised. These are incredibly strong so even after 100 closes it still takes some strength to close the back door.
B00XOIU18G|5|Excellent quality for the money, this is fairly heavy duty.
B0002Z9KE0|5|Perfect makes really easy to reach in the bed of your truck when you have a goose neck trailer. Worth the price and more.
B00HD9X2YM|5|Fit like a glove, no issues, flawless install, was able to recycle my colored outer shell
B00HDQDYSE|4|light is not bright enough to be seen easily.  otherwise works very well
B00K8VQE7Y|1|*UPDATE* I bought this July 21st, and it is completely falling apart now, only a month and a half later (by early Sept) Literally crumbling to pieces of flaky, crisp plastic. I am very displeased. The return window has now passed, but you need to know: THIS DOES NOT LAST! It has made a huge mess all over my newly cleaned car. So disappointed!  (Original 2 star review: I wanted to love this sun shield, but I can't. I'm only vaguely fond of it. The picture is great, clearly printed, and fun to see when I search for my car in a parking lot. That is literally the only thing it has going for it. The material it's made out of is not up to the Texas sun at all. The whole shade is already deformed from where it bumps against the edges of my car. It does worse at blocking light and heat than my 10 year old snap shade that I was trying to replace. This product is a decoration. Think of it like that, and you'll probably be much happier.)
B0013IPSGO|5|Been out of town.  Prompt delivery.  Love the seat.  Well made and so comfortable I can now sit on my wooden bench my brother in laws made for my Mom.
B00GJZ38E0|5|was birthday gift for my niece.  just what she wanted.
B00KXAK6J2|3|The decal seems to be alright, but I have a 3 window back window and the decal curls and doesn't adhere to the part which is not glass.  I had the decal professionally installed so some cutting was done.  The US Army, and the Veteran are not on glass and I'm afraid it won't be long before I loose those portions of the decal.
B00348B6TY|5|Nice sticker
B0040CZ608|5|This was a good product.
B001FANR54|4|The directions are annoying. After three adults tossed them aside and went with common sense we were able to install them relatively easy. It's possible to do even if you're too mechanically UN-inclined to figure out a cell phone, but if you're familiar with metric wrenches and know your way around hex bolts and lock washers, then you're golden! Look better than expected. Heavier-duty and nicer than expected too.
B000TYSBYY|5|Excellent
B004M6Q2G4|5|I love S&B products. Needed a new filter so that I can have one on standby while I clean the other.<br /><br />2006 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9L S&B cold air intake with scoop

B004A2D4N4|5|Perfect fit to replace the roof/floor blend door actuator in 2006 Expedition.  Of course it is, it's an OEM replacement part!<br /><br />Save yourself some headache, you don't need to pull the whole side off.  Pop out the cupholder and the tray and you can reach all the bolts.  10 minute fix.
B00JRE38EA|5|Way better than the original lights the car came with, brighter but burns a lot  cooler than the filament bulbs which if left on long enough warps the plastic casings or coverings as in the case of my previous car.

B009AQS5JS|5|So cute on my black car
B00JJZ26UO|2|Bought these for my wifes cruiser, and one blew out last week.  Ive had them 1.5 months.  They were easy to install and worked great untill it broke.  Like the other people said not as heavy duty as factory.
B0000UZ528|5|this works fine, does what i want it to do
B00OIIRAQM|4|Had to drill a small hole for a small rubber stop but other than that great product fit perfectly.
B00T4TEWBQ|5|great little trash can. i like the removable liner which u can clean easily. beats having to put empty grocery bags to line the trash bag. just started using it. so cant comment on durability. but looks sturdy.
B007ZGDEO6|5|Looks good. Sounds good. One of the best cai systems that I ever bought. *** The instructions tell you you have to take off the bumper cover. That is FALSE. Just remove the fender liner...... Done.***
B00CSCYHI4|5|Chinese made but still fit and work well
B00B1WMNZG|5|Totally eliminated neck pain on my FJR1300. I would buy it again.
B0031BH1KM|5|Awesome price and very good quality.
B007KFMHSG|5|Fast shipping, match vehicle perfect. No problems with parts. instructions helped.
B00MXBZS74|5|Great kit for doing a NP246 rebuild!  Seemed to come with every thing I needed (Except snap rings, which it doesn't list it as having the snap rings) and then a few extra items which I could only assume were from different variations of the 246.  Made the job quick and easy and fixed all my transfer case noises.  Just make sure and do your research on what else you will need like a case guard and the various bearing pullers in order to facilitate the rebuild.  I really wish that someone would put out a kit that has both the bearings and the snap rings in one.  I would highly suggest replacing the snap rings for the extra piece of mind.
B005Z8HAUK|5|Others are jealous of my double pump action.
B000R4QXF0|5|Not much to go wrong with cleats!
B00JA3BMDW|5|Nice for checking pool temp and AC output temps. Had to hide it from the kids because they liked the laser. But you can turn the laser off and still kids lost interest. Great tool.
B00M0CQD9S|5|Good looks OEM!! Good choice for the price !
B0016IT3X0|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado!
B009GIUB2Y|5|Fit perfectly and was a breeze to self install.
B000BQQMSC|5|Heavy Duty.... yet very flexible. They fit my 94 Ranger perfectly. They clean very nicely with the garden hose. The smell was that of a new car, not a toxic smell like some I've had. You can't go wrong with these mats.
B00ID7EDRI|5|Easy and simple to install.  Done in 5 min.
B008KX06RQ|5|Im travel very much At night.... Its perfectly
B00YI3IGA6|5|I LOVE these. Very durable. These are way better than the cheap pull down shades. I really like being able to roll the windows down and get a nice breeze. These are dark enough to allow my kids to sleep in the back without the sun being in there eyes which is great. All in all a 5 star product.
B0002MB80C|5|Feels great. Just make sure you use a hairdryer on high heat to get it loosened up so that installation is much easier.
B00G6188EM|5|Was really easy to apply and looks great!  I have a red Yamaha FJ-09 (MT-09 Tracer) and while the reds are not identical, the complement each other well.
B00CMB6U3G|4|As expected
B009GIPEYE|1|This is quite possibly the worst piece of auto equipment I've ever seen. Packed  loose in a box, with no packing support. Removed and inspected, found the two wires in the motor connector pushed back too far, won't make connections. Fixed that and started to install. Guess what? One of the hub bolt holes in the wrong location from stock. Get out the drill and drill into my door(2000 Dodge Durango), and get the motor mounted, and check it moves. Now align the window regulator arms, and the metal braces are thin pot metal. The first brand new 10mm head screw I put in is not running smooth. I look at the back of the brace and there is no nutplate, or welded nut! They just punched the metal back, and ran a tap through it! Has about 2 turns of screw threads to catch the bolt. What crap. Now, I line up the top, and the bottom two screws won't line up in my door. I check the old one from factory and hmmmm, they are a perfect fit. New one is off about 6-8mm. Get out the drill again. Finally got the regulator lined up and surprise! Now the bolts for the window catch won't align. This think is way, way off. My door has never been hit, it's a bone stock Durango, and I've been working on cars for 35 years. Never, ever have I seen such poor quality. I'm going to leave it in for a few months until I'm sure it's going to come apart, then I get to do the job all over again with a factory piece and send this crap junk back to the seller.
B005KOZ25Y|5|Everybody should own one of these. So easy to use and already have saved a few hundred dollars. The service was great and actually received the unit a couple of days early.
B00BKWTGHK|2|worked great at first, but the swicth quit working so it will not turn off.  Love how easy it was to install.  hoping i can get them to replace it.  only had it for 2 months.
B001BDPGB8|2|wires were way to long for the vehicle and did not have the proper angle for the plugs.  the coil wire was 12'' to long.  had to use because i had no more wires but will never use again.  quality of the wire seemed ok but beware of pictures of wires as they do not always represent what you will actually get
B0040D0QAW|5|These worked great to get the rear hatch panel on my GFs Element to stop falling off. Perfect item is that is what's happening to you. I'm sure they work on other panels, but I didn't need to use them for anything else.
B000E7YP7I|5|Really nice and sturdy product.
B000ABCHMS|5|Will extend life and performance of belts.
B004R4QSTC|5|Nice hitch. Best looking I've ever seen. I love the stow away feature.
B00029XEEI|5|makes hooking up jumper cables or winch a breeze
B0002BC0T6|4|its solid as a rock and a tad on the heavy side, lends to it being heavy duty.  the mechanism to retract it is a little quirky.
B00NJ0MUGA|5|nice.
B00J40468E|4|I got this blaster bout a year ago and it was awesome, but I always felt like it needed something. I realized it needed accessories and more ammo. I recommend this to anyone who wants a realistic WW1 era blaster but just don't shoot it when you don't need to... It's really loud
B00I4NPZK0|5|Looks great on my laptop and was easy to put on
B00AF67MSC|3|It is really bright. But it wasn't weather proof as I expected. I ordered twice on this product.
B00BDPFPNI|5|Genuine part. Can't beat the price.
B000GZL29M|5|heen using this batter charger/tender nonstop for three years now and it hasn't failed.  Don't let its small size fool you.
B00OLC8PUA|4|Haven't installed as yet, but looks fine.
B0054RGHVU|1|Sticks out about 3&#34; to 4&#34;  too far.  Have to be careful walking around the car so you don't get caught on it.  Some what dangerous.  Wrong length for sure. Maybe they send me one for a different car?  Had to take it off. looked good from the front but from the side it looked like my car was getting ready to joust.  Not a great design at all. Sticks way, way to far out.
B00EKKJG4C|5|Work great. Bright and warm.
B00JUQFVX6|5|I surprised my grandson with this on the seat of his mom's car. I filled it with small gifts. He loved it and all of his gifts. It is nicely made and the straps fit snugly on the seat without the passenger feeling them.
B004C0XKGK|5|After hooking up an OBD reader (diagnostic reader and app you can get for your smartphone at the Android Playstore) to my Lexus es300, I found the coolant sensor was jumping from a 90 degree reading to 32 degrees within seconds. The sensor was obviously malfunctioning so I ordered this as a replacement ($20).  Once replaced, it fixed ALL my starting and fluctuating idle problems and no more engine light. Super happy! The diagnosis and work at a dealer would have easily cost $500 for replacement of this $20 problem. Hope this helps.
B000C9ACZW|5|Works perfect and good price.
B0036GG1FI|5|Love this oil.  I've ordered it twice for use in my 2 stroke mopeds.  I particularly like the dispensing tube that comes out of the top and the lack of the green most 2stroke oils are treated with.  Low smoke, great performance, this is my go to 2 stroke oil.
B0024ECBCA|5|works great
B00HW58R92|5|Just as expected
B004RCRS9I|5|Very High Quality<br />Very Convenient<br />Works like a charm<br />No problems at all<br />Love the bristles on the sides, this really makes cleaning easy

B00HR26X6O|5|Worked great fit perfectly looks just like the pictures could not be happier arrived on time just a perfect experience all around 100% A+. I installed them on my wife 13 Tahoe looks great!!
B0101BNDSS|3|Was not in channel like I had expected. Issue was resolved by the seller
B000GTUEL0|4|These baffles are 2&#34; dia. x 10.25&#34; long.  I bought them for my Cobra Drag Pipes.  They fit perfectly.  I recently bought my 2008 Suzuki Boulevard C50.  The previous owner installed these Cobra Drag pipes but I guess he removed the baffles from them. As far as &#34;quiet&#34; baffles go, these V&H baffles got the best reviews.  Although they didn't necessarily reduce the noise, they did change the note to a much lower growl and they GREATLY reduced the cracking and popping when backing off the throttle or down shifting.  The cracking and popping noise was just awful. Really made the bike sound un-tuned.  They are a tight fit.  I did have to wrap thin wire around the fiberglass packing to get them into my pipes.  Once I got them started I was able to stick a broom stick in them and tap them the rest of the way in as these baffles have a plate welded to the end.  The problem is lining up the screw hole.  I couldn't.  I missed the hole on both pipes just by a hair and couldn't get the screw in.  Like I said, they are a tight fit.  Getting them back out and trying again will be a nightmare so I just didn't bother screwing them in.  So far, 50 miles later, they are still exactly in the same spot.  They haven't backed out at all and I can't imagine they will back out.
B00B17E0SE|1|Poor repacement for oem parts, hit a bump and the fender ended up coming off while on the highway, Glad I still kept some original ones I carefully took off, I put them on in the main areas and havent had that incident happen since
B0038BBJH6|5|5 stars so far. They fit and look good. I will update if I have issues in the future, such as leaking or fogging, since I've only had them one day so far
B0012PJRRY|5|Saved money and its a name brand also. Don't shop at a parts store. Buy it here.
B00OT8NZVU|3|When the spoiler got to me he had damage
B00P9OF04I|5|First product that actually worked! I used a drill and kept going over and they look new!
B006QH552E|5|Arrived in a sturdy box, was a bit too tall for my 2005 Mustang battery tray, so had to buy a custom tray from UPR.<br />I found out that you can take your old battery to (your local auto parts shop that has the same Irish last name as that host on FoxNews whose first name is Bill) for a $5 gift card!  Works great, but since I only drive the car once in awhile, I still keep it on a battery tender as a safety precaution.
B00BFZZVUS|5|Adorable snoopy product and great seller!
B00PQZLH2O|3|I bought the bench and front seat covers, hoping to save my new car's interior from wear and tear and Texas heat. The pictures look nicer than the actual product because the pictures do not have headrests, seat belt straps, or seat belt clips showing. You have to cut holes for all of those after installation. I was tempted to give only 2 stars because I really do not like the product. I would have taken it off and returned it if we had not already cut holes in everything. The fabric feels icky. It feels like a cheap Walgreens Halloween costume, that weird, stretchy, not breathable stuff. I figure that I will use them for about 6 months until the heat calms down here and take them off in the winter. They really cheap-ify my new car :(
B000Z0HVHA|5|Nice
B00J52R33Q|1|disappointed because on direct tv it will not pick up local channels

B00JH74C88|3|Love the lights but controller doesn't work right, turns lights on at any time and won't shut off with the remote and have to b unplugged to reset
B00HNMLQAG|4|Cheap, but did the job!
B00U2C33DM|5|Awesome quality very lightweight!
B00IUE5S5U|5|Great product! smells like new leather, softens and cleans....... would definitely recommend this product.
B00CFXW1AM|3|I got these installed a few days ago.  As expected, HID is significantly brighter than the halogen lights that these replaced.  Of course, the reason most people buy these projector housings is so that we don't blind others.  As another reviewer mentioned, these are equivalent to the Morimoto Mini H1 5.0, and I agree...though I do wonder if these are actually Morimoto factory rejects or B-stocks (or old stocks given Morimoto's are now in its 6th generation).<br /><br />The reason I think this is due to the quality.  On my particular set, I had to file some parts of the projectors to get the shrouds to fit (manufacturing tolerances not that good).  The cut-off shields were also not aligned properly, though I just realigned them when I took the projectors apart to clean the reflector bulbs and lenses.  Speaking of cleaning, the chrome plating on the shrouds are not that good.  In the process of fitting and cleaning to try to fit it into my headlights, I perhaps wiped the shrouds down 4 or 5 times with a clean microfiber towel.  On one of the shrouds, I notice that the chrome is already coming off (beginning to see the plastic).  On the other shroud, there was a spot at the front that's not really chromed.  Also, one reviewer said that the shrouds come with screws to mount them, but mine didn't come with any screws for the shrouds.  When I contacted the seller, he seems to imply that they do not.  That's not a big deal, because I found that my old floppy disk drive screws fit perfectly.<br /><br />I was mounting these into headlights with 9007 bulbs, so I wasn't able to use either of the metal washers for the horizontal beam alignment, so it's a bit more work for me to make sure they were horizontal before I fully tighten the nuts.  Of course I still have to use the smaller washers to properly mount the projectors (which requires a bit of cutting and milling on my 9007 lights).  I didn't want to paint my reflectors black, because for me that seems to cheapen the look of the car...not to mention that the reflective surfaces make the headlights look crystal-like (like a jewel).  Anyway, as the shrouds leave gaps on the back, you should be prepared to buy some aluminum tape to prevent light from leaking to the back and end up reflecting onto your reflectors, thereby causing errant light and somewhat defeating the purpose of having projectors.  I think an additional benefit of using aluminum tape is that it keeps the light inside, so that there's more light going out toward the front (not that the aluminum tape is that reflective).<br /><br />Even though for some cars, the installation of these will be somewhat plug-and-play, on mine I had to cut the reflectors at the bottom because I couldn't &#34;center&#34; the projectors with the shrouds on.  On mine, it turned out to be a lot more work than I had initially thought.  I could have retrofitted the higher-end Morimoto models and it would still be about the same amount of work...  Of course these are just $30, so even despite its shortcomings, I still find these projectors to be a good value.<br /><br />With that said, there are a couple of things that concern me.  As these use the H1 HID bulbs, and there are no seals around the base of the H1 bulbs, I wonder if moisture will get inside.  I have modified mine so that the solenoid wires are protected by the dust covers, so the only place it's going to get moisture in is through the bulbs (well, unless I didn't seal my lenses back to the headlights very well...)  The other concern is the longevity of the solenoid for the high beams.  These are very small compared to some of the OEM solenoids.  But I guess the good news is that if they do fail, they default to low beam.
B001KPNBBY|5|Replaced the arm on a Chrysler 2007 T&C. Works as expected. No issues after 6 months.
B00A2C2W70|3|Not bad product but the quality is a little flimsy.  I wish it was more rigid and the cost was way to high for this product, the floor mats do fit as expected with no issues there.  Just wish they lowered the price and they were a little misleading on the packaging that stated &#34;Made In USA&#34; when i actuality it states &#34; Made with american tooling&#34;
B00IX4CMM4|5|Very good.
B00ZI6Z3B2|5|Awesome belt!!!
B002BHRXJ6|2|Poor quality. Apparently the manufacturer's standards for quality control was not evident. It's pretty much a &#34;one-time&#34; use device.
B00BF1FTIQ|5|These are just cool. And they are bigger then they look too but yet are still smallish.
B00Q6CSXPK|5|Excellent product
B00EE56UAG|5|It's perfect!<br /><br />My saddlebags aren't wide enough for a full face helmet and, unlike my last bike, I no longer have a touring trunk.  I was in search for a helmet lock.  But I did not like the idea of carrying another key.  One of the reasons I spent so much more on a full-dresser motorcycle was that the saddlebags would use the same key as the ignition, instead of using aftermarket hard saddlebags.  So this is GREAT!<br /><br />No, it's not extraordinarily robust.  A determined thief will access my helmet with relative ease.  If a determined thief wants my helmet, I am insured, and I can buy another helmet.  What this really does, is stops the opportunist walking through a parking lot seeing something they can easily pluck up off of my seat, and make a few bucks at a pawn shop.  I stick my camera and bluetooth headset unit in a saddlebag, and lock with Carabiner onto my rear crash guards, with the optional cable (also available on Amazon) through the chin bar.  Being a combination lock, there is no key.  Sweet!
B00429NKWK|5|I applied two months ago and the box says it only takes half an hour to do, it took over an hour but the results were great. I have gone through the car wash several times, my headlights are still clear and look new. I would recommend this product.
B00H1I5WGQ|5|DPAccessories  D3111-ht-2305/20 20 premium is great lug nut
B00J1CUXS2|5|They accidently shipped the wrong part at first and called me before I opened the box.  They had the right part to me very quickly.  Part worked great and what I expected.
B00N23V5LU|1|I liked the look, but upon installation, the plastic ring that tightens the mirror in place broke without making the mirror secure, at all.  This happened on both mirrors. A gentle breeze is all it takes to move the mirrors out of place.<br /><br />I hope they will honor the return policy.
B0046VN8JO|3|Works good.  Wear gloves when applying as it's not too good for your skin.  You get a tiny amount per package so if you're filling a long crack or, in my case, creating a composite bumper with seams over a ft long, buy several packages.
B0017OALKM|5|great!
B00BEN3CYS|5|Just what I was looking for
B000S2SRXC|5|Worked great on my truck.
B0002U1TX0|5|The manufacturer of our newly purchased bronze oil-rubbed faucets and fixtures, recommended protecting them with non-abrasive carnauba wax, a product that proved to be unavailable where I live. I could find carnauba wax, but nothing labeled non-abrasive, and a local auto dealership said there was a difference.<br /><br />I applied the product liberally and wiped it off with a soft cloth. Water now bounces off the faucets and the other accessories to which I applied it. Hopefully this treatment will prevent soaps and other products from discoloring the bronze oil-rubbed finish. I also makes it easier to dust the free-standing items, i.e. a toilet tissue holder and a toilet brush holder.  I gave the wax five stars because, after several months of occasional applications, it seems to protect the items to which it was applied.
B001F0GZZ8|3|Works great on vinyl and OK on Rubber
B0055XHBHC|5|Had a different mattress but purchased this one to see if it helped.  My husband and I were both having back and sleep issues.  We did not have our hope too high...but we slept on it for a very short time (a couple days) and we both noticed our backs were doing better and we were sleeping.  I highly recommend this mattress.  We are long term RVers a mattress is an investment and this one has worked great for us and we did not spend a fortune.
B0087NB0ZQ|5|Works very well. It's easy to operate. The sound is clear and the battery life was very good. Very pleased.
B00PC5TJ5A|1|Not too happy no manual had to guess everything. Maf sensor hole was not big enough  and bolt holes were not placed where they shoud of been. Over all not too happy im a mecanic for living and it took me 2 hours to set it up. Pay a bit more and get somthing better
B000G76ORK|4|Used as a flower vase as a gift for someone that had replacement surgery, went over extremely well. In fact, it has become a permanent part of the decor on her desk.
B00US77EZ4|4|Great sticker, once I got it!!  The folks responded very kindly when I contacted them to find out what was taking so long.  Love the sticker!!
B0000CBIK5|5|works great, not too hard to use
B00J52R3AE|5|Worked great am getting ready to place on top of motor home
B00P67GT7K|5|Outstanding at removing swirls and light damage from improper washing and other light paint defects. Try to use these 2 as a pair and not one or the other, the results will blow you away. the V36 is aggressive enough the take away any holograms, marring, and swirls that occur from compounding. However when the V38 is introduced afterwards two things happen. 1. the paint section your working on will be jeweled to an incredible shine and 2. there will be next to 0 smaller swirls or holograms all provided if you used the correct pad and working time. V32/34 dust considerably and honestly i would just stick to other name brand compounds ( Meguiars and Menzerna to name a few). If your looking for a relatively affordable polishing combo then i'd definitively stick to these two polishes. V36 can dust and as well i've found that it can also get pretty oily on foam pads so just ensure you clean your pad after a few passes.<br />First photo is after the passenger side was done with V36/V38 with an orange Hexlogic pad for the 36 and a white Hexlogic pad for the V38. Machine used was a Rupes LHR15ES<br />Second Photo: completely done with Chemical guys glossworkz glaze, jetseal, and Blacklight hybrid radiant finish in that order.
B001IX2J9I|5|Excellent
B000CO7DIQ|5|works great
B0009XXNRK|5|Very good!
B000C57YMK|5|Perfect fit,  great price!
B003U4O414|1|I purchased a bottle of this additive to put in New remanufactured engine that I had bought for my trailblazer. The particles suspended in the additive completely blocked a set of very fine screens in the exhaust cam timing solenoid and ended up starving the head for oil. I lost countless hours in labor removing the engine so that I could check the pickup tube/screen and oil pump.
B001G97YKI|3|i was going to get them installed today but the mechanic said it would be 250$ in labor (3 hours) to install them.  the product is in great quality and straight forward design.  I will put up another review  after i get them install.
B000IMG6O4|5|ITS A GREAT TOOL TO REALISE MEASURENMET WHEN YOU CAN´T INTRODUCE THE PIN CONECTOR
B000VLF89Q|3|Still not a one person job with it. Holds top well, not what I was hoping for as in ease to remove top. Good storage option
B00275A6JG|5|Thanks for all ,fine
B001DRJN4I|5|The price was right. Fit like a glove. Quality filter.
B00T5DJZ4K|1|Did not fit my in my Jeep. Was refunded with no questions asked.
B000E4LONE|5|Tailgate handle fit perfect.  Easy to install and now my tailgate is working great.  Also, purchased the clips.  They worked great also.  Did not know that the Tailgate handle came with clips.  Should advertise better.  Thanks
B000AURZ08|5|I've used this exclusively in my 911 to handle the rigors of track use and it works flawlessly.  No issues with boiling and lasts easily for 2-3 track days without issue.  Performs equally as well on the street too.
B003676LXE|5|Gets five stars for three pairs at a reasonable price.  These gloves are not for daily heavy duty work.  If you use them for light duty occasional work around the house, etc. then this is a good deal.  If you use them daily for rough work buy a thicker glove designed for that reason.
B00LCTE30Q|2|Mats look great, but do not fit the retention posts on my 2012 SRX. Adam at Yates Performance was very helpful, but after weeks of sending emails  and photos I still did not get a return, reimbursement  or replacement.  The mats do not stay securely in place, and in my opinion are not worth the money paid for &#34; custom fit &#34; mats.
B004IA5BQQ|5|great fit and look
B007FFNXPC|5|It came fast and right on time fit perfectly and fixed the problem. Unfortunately a tree fell on the car two weeks later
B008G22G1A|4|The fit wasn't perfect, there is an 1/2 inch cap along the bottom but at least I can see to drive now.  (Not a flush fit) shipping and customer service was excellent.
B000I21KJA|5|A must have for anyone removing shift linkages on a Honda/Acura.  Removal or installation of the roll pin in the linkage takes less than 30 seconds with a hammer, or less than 10 seconds with an air hammer.  I used an &#34;alternative&#34; method for many years, and I can't believe I waited so many years before investing in one of these.  Worth every penny!!!
B00JVHLS3G|1|Fake, fades out in a few months.  The OEM roundel is not chrome in the back and the date stamp on this one is just nonsense to look like OEM.
B008OJ5HGG|3|when stretched out it gets pretty flimsy.  also allows the drain hose to fall to the ground sometimes
B000JYWVEA|5|Fast shipping great water pump works great
B006NQUE5Q|5|My door handle  works really good,I'm happy with my purchase.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Easy to use,  easy to store, works perfect in my SUV, buying one for my Sedan.
B004WGNIZM|1|you look very cheap, the photo is embroidery and I received is stamped and looks very cheap, I do not like it seems that is not original
B007KTINWQ|5|Excellent product. Just mist on and wipe off. Take care to apply this on a cold paint or you will see streaks. Keeps my car nice and shiny for the next 2/3 weeks with ease (just use a California Duster to wipe off the dust every couple of days).
B00RCBERJK|5|These switchback LED bulbs were installed in my 2004 F150 XLT SCAB today, I had already replaced the factory signal relay with an LED rated relay so hyper-flashing, or LED error were not an issue. You have a 50/50 shot when you stick them in the socket, if they don't light flip them around, I hit 500 installing mine. They seem like a great choice and should work for the 04-08 F150's as long as you replace your relay (I reviewed the correct relay as well). Well made, nice heavy feel to them not flimsy feeling or being afraid to touch them and they fall apart. The white is very bright as is the orange and easily seen during summer daylight hours. The switchback function preformed flawlessly with an instant change from white to orange when the signals or hazard lights are switched on. I would buy them again but hopefully given their lifespan I wont have to, highly recommended!
B00JGG0W0C|5|Lived up to expectations.
B000FP8HFK|5|It's tape.
B00DUL8BSO|3|It's a little on the cheep side. Material is fairly thin. The grommets are plastic. The front draw string it mostly just for show if there is more than an occasional breeze where you live. I've got it held on with bungee cords. I have an 09 Mustang.
B006QH55YW|5|Got 2 for my 2004 dodge ram diesel they work great, vary fast starting. came with extra brackets to mount them properly. nice fit
B0002UHVTQ|5|I purchased these were all power outlets in my camper and installed them and they work very nicely
B0055AZZ9G|5|Used the floor mount in our '06 F350, bent it perfectly to rest on the Center console.  Bouncy work truck,  impressively stable.  Holds S10.5 in a Griffin all terrain case perfectly.  Seems stout and sturdy.  Toss the cheap screws it comes with and get some self tapers and you're golden.. Don't hesitate to buy,  you won't regret it!  Excellent price,  fast delivery,  AWESOME PRODUCT! !
B00E5OUOCQ|1|Not jumbo at all. Did not fit the car
B005FNKSMW|4|This brought the $5 rummage sale Barbie Jeep back to life! The charger and battery work just fine and were the best price I could find after searching many vendors.
B004LX3AS6|5|Real handy.+++++
B000EQQPN6|1|I don't recommend this product. Yes, it appears to be a good deal but every cheap deal isn't good. The bearing started to make a roaring noise after two months. The bearing AcDelco is using is not good quality.
B00BITLC9A|5|EXCELLENT
B0071HE2DG|5|Every rider needs this
B00BITLD8A|5|EXCELLENT
B000VT0JBU|5|Great look.
B000EQS1CE|5|Worked perfectly, purchased at a fraction of the price if purchased locally.
B0057FUEYK|5|not a problem
B00062YCPQ|3|reduces sun exposure
B00W97YXH8|5|Fits perfectly and as advertised!
B000CIRU6W|5|Very good Thank you.
B000EQQOSW|5|is a little longer than original
B001JT7DDI|5|Great product great price.
B00DP68GTS|5|Bought this HID kit to upgrade my stock headlights on my 2015 Mazda 3.  I've always hated when driving and having my headlights drowned or flooded out by street lights or other headlights.  Problem solved!  Street markings and signs and now well illuminated and reflect.  This kit was very easy to install - 20 mins for each headlight, and that was just for having to replace through the wheel well.  If your unsure on how to replace or easiest way to replace - either consult your owners manual or search youtube.  I would highly recommend this kit to anyone - all connector wires are included as very simple to install.  Color output is as stated - I ordered the 6000k.  My only complaint would be that the light pattern doesn't seem to throw out as much (distance).  I'm sure I could try and adjust the beam/angle of my projector headlights, but don't want to blind oncoming traffic as well.  The difference is night and day - literally.  I've attached photos to compare the yellow halogen look (before) and the HID 6000K look (after)
B0049Z8X4C|5|Great
B005FM0RLK|5|Great price, fast shipping, perfect fit!
B004J6MFKY|1|Terrible product.
B005H2SHS8|5|Good deal
B00IAB94EO|5|The cheapest brand that I found anywhere. These are perfect! I have a 2012 F-150 Crew Cab 4x4 xlt. Fit and look great. Pretty easy to put on. Its 2 bolts each side. Some reviews said longer bolts where needed. Have no idea why. The bolts on my truck fit perfect. The liners fit snug, so yes a little elbow grease is needed! But they have just enough flex to get them right. Make sure, and the instructions say this also, make sure you do a good cleaning job in the wheel well. My mechanic recommended I get these to prevent rust and corrosion. Don't know why ford doesn't put them on? But for the price its okay. Makes the truck look nice too!
B00R6S0MEI|5|This is even better than the ultimate nozzle! We love it and we love supporting our Veterans!!!
B000CLXKPY|4|Seems to be at least as good as the local auto store brands. Time will tell, but the price was good so I have high hopes.
B007CLNIJK|5|I purchased this to replace a replacement mirror I had installed about 6 months ago. This was less money and much better quality. It barely vibrates, I'd say no more than the original factory unit, the other replacement had a ton of vibration and fell apart after 1 car wash. I won't be taking this one thru the car wash, just in case, but so far I'm very pleased.
B00CP8XXU4|5|Great product! Fit perfectly!
B0000AY4YX|4|Just used it to remove the oxidation on the front of my 27 ft RV.  Worked very well.  I used it with the Shurhold random orbital buffer which made the process much easier and faster.
B007RXI4JW|5|Perfect for my cars dome light much brighter than OEM looks great to... Instead of the yellow looking halogens.
B005EKY1EM|5|Been using for awhile now. Really light the features on this. Haven't had any problems with any of my 3 units now.
B001EAWOE0|3|Didn't work for me and it wasn't until after the fact that I found out that your factory CD player has to work in order for this to work.  When it is installed you have to be able to put a CD In to the factory CD player (The remote single disc unit installed with the factory head units that had a tape deck), this then interrupts the sound coming from the deck to allow you to listen to one of two inputs.  A great idea, but the majority of the factory CD players out there that support this are dead by now and not worth spending the money on it to fix it.  I replaced this with the iSimple unit that replaces the factory CD player and gives you iPod control and it worked great for the 3 weeks I used it before I finally gave up trying to make the factory GM stereo do what I want and just went with a Kenwood.<br /><br />If you are wanting to keep the factory deck and your CD player works this may be a great alternative, but it acts like a dummy input and I think there are easier ways of installed one of those on a GM stereo.  If your CD player doesn't work definitely go with the iSimple interface that replaces the CD player, controlling your iPod from the factory stereo is a nice ability.
B000BYB7RU|3|they work.
B00DI3D9TU|3|These do not fit very well but look OK.  Made of plastic and stuck on with double sided tape.  What would you expect at the price!
B00546A92E|5|Exactly what I ordered and perfect fit.
B007P73O90|4|Gasket kit is decent. Do not pay for air shipping as this is waaayyyyy overcharged.
B00852684M|1|I ordered several of these, 3 sets in total, and not a single light worked.  I had some very sad kids at our block party bike parade.
B000CQTT7M|3|Brakes are Ok good job
B00GSAUHB8|2|I do notice that the temperature in my car is less using this sun protector. 2 stars are for the non-intuitive way to fold the protector. 4 weeks later and I still get flap on the face trying to figure out how to fold it right. It is not as easy as it seems.
B00T4TEWBQ|5|Good product. Seems sturdy. Extra pockets are handy.
B00BXH566W|5|Came with two!
B000C5SGCC|5|Perfect replacement in my 2000 Civic EX
B000CIJLOG|5|Fantastic replacement for the plastic OEM handle that will break on you if you give it longer enough.
B00CFALFXY|5|Way better than I ever expected. They are almost addictive.  Once you find out how well they work, you start dusting, polishing, wiping smudges, cleaning countertops....you can't stop. I keep one in each car, one by the computer, one in the kitchen.  Just the right size, too.
B00HQEWR2W|5|Good quality and nice size!!!
B000C5A058|5|Great quality and got it quickly. Could not be more pleased.
B00BITICRA|5|Fast delivery...great product
B002M3WFRO|5|Super fast delivery and item exactly as described!
B000E4LONE|5|Very pleased
B0040R13IC|5|Had to get these because when my windshield was being replaced they broke mine! These do exactly as they say they do and are a great price. I was excited about that!
B00ECWFHHI|4|Product is well made. The instructions could not have been worse !!
B0007IN98K|5|Nice book and fast service !!
B00JGQJ64A|1|installation was easy. took about 5 minutes.  the left side reverse lights were already burnt out once I plugged them in.  Amazon has accepted my return, & I will try these out one more time.  Hopefully this time they will work & my review will change.
B000B8Y016|4|Works as designed ... shape is great for leverage ... time will tell how long the construction will last ...
B00Z7KIZPA|5|just like picture shows
B003VLBPJA|5|Quality materials. Have had this net for a little while-- I use it often and it has held up well.
B007NNH122|1|txks,looks great,but have to make adjustments,as this car is 57 pont. price and shipping perfect, will return to amiazon for future purchases.
B000GTJ5I8|5|This works excellent, used it for my 90 Mustang.  This was well worth the money.
B004OE34LK|5|Very nice. Love it
B003U56R68|5|Excelent quality inserts, just clean very well before install
B001JT1CEE|4|Worked good for a lighting project i was doing.
B003R7HTT8|4|professional
B00M0D4FU6|5|Easy to install and very bright!  Love them!  Great added protection for others to see you!
B009B9NGTS|3|It doesnt fit perfectly, it is too short
B00G91CJ9Y|5|gr8
B00OZP9V3S|5|As stated.
B000JFJMFK|5|Works well and fits.
B00KTHYCEO|5|It works ! Thank you!
B00BWT353C|1|Don't buy I bought two sets of them plugged them all in and they all lit up red not blue I specifically ordered blue ones I got red they are also really dim and not bright for dome lights don't buy I will be throwing them in the trash a whole 15 bucks later
B002MQCY7C|3|It was fairly easy to install, and definitely stays locked when in use, but I wish the edges were smoother.  The corners rub against my chin from time to time.  It doesn't hurt, but it's annoying, especially since the collar of my current jacket is a little taller and pushes the strap up against my chin.  I also don't feel like it's super easy to lock -- it's easy to misalign the connecting pieces.  Overall, I'm a little disappointed.  I'll almost certainly end up try a different brand.
B00GFDAAF6|5|Excelente seller
B0012INT98|4|I had never used a &#34;soft&#34; roof top carrier before buying this one.  I wanted something that doesn't take up much space to store since I need to use it infrequently.  This really did the job.  It was easy to secure to the roof, and it kept everything in place and dry.  It was not as easy to load as a hard carrier, but the reward is that it easily folded back into its medium sized storage bag.  It is a real bargain for the money, and it works very well. I would recommend buying the roof pad, as well.
B00NWRKXZA|5|Very sharp looking.
B00E0JLS2G|5|just as described worked well no complaints
B00G0OL4Y6|5|Perfect fit and function.  No extra rigging or reworking to make it fit.
B0010DZZQ0|5|now the car doesnt smell like an old car any more
B003177UIE|3|Is not long enough for a Spyder.  Need to be able to purchase a another piece of Velcro.  Other wise a great a idea.
B000C5HZBK|5|fixed my 1965 ford galaxie heater problem
B00VQL0UW0|5|Great price. Great fitment. Great results.
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Very please .use on my ultra. Very bright white. Will replace all my bulbs with JDM atar
B00C7XX4AQ|5|Fit perfectly and at 1/3 the dealers price.  my mechanic commented that this seemed to be more flexible than the Nissan product and may be less prone to getting damaged.  We'll see!
B001JL23FY|5|a
B0006HLQNW|3|This is okay, but only if you're able to install a adjustable fuel regulator. Otherwise it has a hard time keeping your fuel delivery smooth. Also puts the idle way too low for my cam, 600 rpm idle
B00KV7FMNC|1|does not stop heat
B003S6IDP2|4|part arrived in a timely manner and seemed well packaged.  install instructions were pathetic for a novice such as myself.  thanks to u tube and a few hours time i was able get it installed.  it fit and worked perfectly which made it all worth while.  if it continues to work, i will be very happy with this purchase.
B0031XULF2|5|It was for my gusban, he is very pleased with it
B00A6AS6LY|5|Great product.  I wish I had known about this many years ago.  Good quality.  Received on time.
B00ED9WMNC|5|Excellent fit.
B00UHD4HJA|2|The stickers i received were the kind of stickers i would give a 5 year old. They were not the stickers in the pickers at all. Not close even. I wish i had gotten cool stickers like i thought i was going to get.
B000JKFZFG|5|Good item.Thanks
B00VKU08P6|5|This works great! It was placed on floor of new garage cement pad so it has stuck very well and has kept me from plowing thru the garage back wall.
B00FQ0P1U8|5|Purchased this when the seat in my Murano broke (OEM bracket is a total piece of junk).<br />Way cheaper than the dealer and had my local mechanic install for me.  Saved me about $500 vs dealer in total (labor/parts).
B001TK7CYM|5|I loved these goggles. I used them daily on hour long rides and they were very comfortable. Unfortunately they were stolen from my saddlebags one day and instead of ordering another pair I opted for normal riding glasses. They work fine but I'm hoping they get stolen so I can order these again.
B000221M94|1|You must reschedule assembly date. I cannot reach anyone. Saturday we are not home. Monday would be good. Please respond.<br />Albert@jacobsgroup.co
B00652G4TS|5|Purchased this to troubleshoot my wife's 2011 Hyundai Tucson Check engine light.  No problems installing the app, connecting the device, and reading the codes.  But when I tried to reset the codes (after doing appropriate repair) it didn't seem to work.  And checking the MIL status screen showed that the codes were in fact, not reset.  Contacted BlueDriver support and they responded within an hour or so that some cars do not allow codes to be reset while engine is running and to try the reset function when ignition was in on position but with the car not running.  This worked fine; the codes reset and the MIL went off.  BlueDriver is very easy to use and the real time displays are both cool and helpful.  Kudos to BlueDriver support for really fast and helpful response to my question.
B00BR0KP1Q|5|Fits perfectly
B00PXMANCA|5|Bought this for someone else. She LOVES it.
B00Q3CQ0YE|5|Fit my '89 Camry great, I have received many compliments on the style of the seat covers. Strong durable material.
B005CWU290|5|Great floor matts.  Fit like a glove in my C class.  Snaps down on the floor button on driver side.  Would recommend to others.
B00X04JRMU|5|Love this stuff. I am on my second gallon bottle in 2 years. I use it on my Harley Low Rider, Jeep Wrangler, and a 36' motor home. It is easy enough to use that while traveling in motor home I use it, people can not believe that it was not just washed and waxed. 1/2 hour to do bike, 1 hour to do Jeep, and about 2 hours for the motor home.
B005VNWCSO|4|Not as good looking as say an Asin water pump, but, it does the job.
B003RAZLMM|1|No it didn't work. It couldn't be programmed. Wasted money
B00030BFQA|2|don't like it and wouldn't recommend it.
B003E1GLSM|5|Trimax TWL100 Ultra-Max Adjustable Wheel Lock is just what I was looking for.
B00EBQJA78|5|Great product
B0033WNIM4|1|This hitch has too much flex in it. Tech support said that I need to use a strap with my bike rack to transfer some of the weight to the trunk lid. How about making a hitch that is stronger? I've been transporting bikes with a hitch for 20+ years and I've never seen a hitch that twists so easily. Hitches should not flex like this one does. My other two cars have Curt hitches and they are great. Curt needs to redesign this hitch.
B00U8RP7T4|5|I ordered the Panel Removal Tool cut for my husband. At first I was going to save it and put it in his stocking because finding stocking stuffers for guys can be somewhat hard.  My husband loves to work on cars in his spare time and is always doing something to one or restoring one.  We have also had to remove the panel to fix the window motor on more than one car and this would have been a huge help if we would have had them when doing that.  Anyway when they came in the mail I was to excited to wait so I went ahead and gave them to him.<br /><br />He was really impressed with assortment in the box.  They are made of some sort of plastic but it is or seems very durable.  There are several tools that will do different jobs and that is my only complaint is that a sheet in the box would descriptions would have been nice but like most garage mechanics my husband didn't seemed phased by it and is willing to try different ones to see which ones work best.  They aren't very long but I assume that is because sometimes you have to get in little spaces.  Overall my husband liked the set and thinks it will work out great.  I was given the chance to review this panel removal kit at a discount price in exchange for my honest opinion. I liked them enough I am thinking about giving them to a few other men that I know work on cars!
B001U6DMSK|2|Not really a right fit but it works
B005H12UGO|4|not exactly OEM factory copy. Blind spot mirror is different than what my 2014 Traverse had,  Missing casket that goes against the door (had to  cut off the old one) and fastners that came with mirror of low quality (reused ones from damaged mirror).  Still a great savings over what the dealership wanted for the part and would re-order if needed
B00080QHMM|5|good tire gauge, easy to use
B004R35VSW|4|Fit was decent, the installation was simple and straightforward. I took a star off because I had to grind about a 1/4&#34; off the upper passenger side above the most rearward bolt because the hitch didn't clear a bracket on the truck there. Once that was done, I hit it up with some spray paint and had no further issues.
B00A326P7M|5|good price. promptly received..
B006O74SSI|5|Fabulous brake pads for the best price!  Installed these on my 2009 Honda CBR Repsol.  Work great!
B000C16XKI|5|Part fits perfectly. I needed to replace the regulator for my 2004 Pontiac Grand Am. The Dorman is cheaper than the original part. It takes about an hour to change this mostly because I had not done this before. If anyone is looking for a how-to guide, this video is very helpful. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFJS6qBaQx8<br /><br />Cheers!
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Great all-purpose towels for cleaning.
B00WGT2PHO|5|The package arrived just a couple of days after I placed the order!  It fit my hitch perfectly and was the exact height I needed for my trailer.  It is constructed from quality materials and the price was great.  Couldn't be more satisfied with it.
B000CO7N3Q|5|Bright and white.... better than I expected it to be.
B00IPS3Y2A|3|Installed quickly and easily.  Package came with multiple adaptors.  However the one for my vehicle was a sloppy fit.  Worried it will pop off easily with little effort.  So far it hasn't but I also don't want to force it!
B009JC8BR4|5|works great for the money
B005VWYP2Q|5|Worked perfectly.
B00LSCOK7I|2|Got the part late<br />Didn't know I won the bid<br />Looks good I hope it works and last a while
B0009XQUKC|1|had to return 2 of this tester that are inaccurate and leaked fuel at the pressure relief valve. Took my car to a shop,thinking my fuel pump was bad and found out it was a false reading from this tester.A big waste of time and had to make 2 trips to the ups store to return. This tester is obviously not tested or certified in any way, by this (china) seller. Seller offered me nothing for my trouble. I advise you dont trust this tool and buy american.
B00FYX2FQK|5|Fit perfect!! Love them!!
B004Y0BZOM|5|Good quality.  Shipped right away.
B00FEX9QIA|2|Apply like it says an I drive over it cuz it can't handle 60 mph waste of another 53 bucks
B00AECX6EQ|5|teriffic product and very easy to install.  Hard to understand why it isn't an option from Chrysler
B00Q4DEINC|1|cute top, but runs VERY small.....says 2x but felt like a small.....
B00YNS1VU8|5|Perfect and excellent in many ways! I have been testing a number of these lately, and this is my number 2-ish choice in the field. My first is the 529V, but the 670V is perhaps the cream of the crop. It is getting tough to distinguish the top gunners and very best ones. The Sony 450 is right there with them. It's very nice, and a positive and unique, top of the line choice. Most outstanding feature is the incredible volume and sound strength for a voice recorder this size, and for a microcassette. I never knew I could have so much fun playing around with a Voice Recorder. It's the highest out of any I have tested. You can turn it all the way up and hear it across a a large size living room - no kidding. I just tried for the second time and couldnt believe it, a machine that small could produce such strong volume. I thought some other ones were good, but this is impressive. I have not yet directly compared it with the 670V volume wise, but it should be an interesting test sometime. Perhaps I should report back on my findings. Voice wise, I was literally just testing mine - and I held mine a good 1-2 feet from my face and it picked up every piece of my commentary.<br /><br />To continue... Additional and desirable dynamics are that a) it's a Sony, b) it looks super sharp, c) has Clear Voice technology, d) is a recent model, e) has extended battery life and endurance, and f) comes across or appears very professional, hip and even modern. So it's basically a sweet Sony! lol : ) I also like the structure on this one a tad more, and is similar to the 529V. It also fits like a &#34;gun&#34; in your hand, with a special grip and feel. I also like the small LED light, tells me it's working and all systems are go. It's a slightly more masculine model, so something to take into consideration for professional woman looking at this option. This is not one of the more slightly feminine Voice Recorders, or color choices - however please note, this is just my opinion.<br /><br />Itlooks great though and functions well, and is definitely not an oversized, complete piece of junk. I cant see anyone being disappointed in one, as long as they get a good one. This is not a $100 Voice Recorder out of the box. This is no Dimestore stuff, regardless if it uses microcassettes or not. The technology is surprisingly still there. Back in the old school days, you would be hot stuff if you had one of these on the job. Obviously the new price of $400 plus says something. The recording quality/capability is very high. Overall, it is up there with the top 5, out of a large field. Panasonic RN305's and a few other Sony models are the only other ones that can truly compare or hang. It's nice, without a doubt. Good stuff! I absolutely like and recommend it : ) 4 - 5 Stars!
B003KI44LK|5|Filters oil, includes required gasket
B009B8UYIK|5|Fits perfect
B00KLKWAUW|4|Put on easy and work great.
B00KFMHAH4|5|This is a quality product. I use it to haul around my kayak's and canoe and have complete confidence in it. It comes mostly assembled and the little that you put together is easy. It's very solid on my truck, does not rattle or make noise. I'd buy this product again, no complaints.
B000CRMNME|5|Perfect fit on my 2014 Sonata Hybrid Limited!
B00N2ERB9O|3|Product as advertised, just didn't get rid of the three amigos as hoped for. I should of benched tested the part, especially with all the work you have to do to replace it. My bad, so I really don't know if it was a good part or not.
B006DS4J6Y|5|As expected, product and delivery.
B00CRQSYY4|5|very good tool wish there were more enhanced instructions
B0002FRWXQ|5|Works great. Had a hard time finding this one. Just what we needed.
B0039LDF4A|5|My 09 Ducati monsters was leaking from the front fork so I took it in to the Ducati dealer l where I got an estimate of over $600 to replace the &#34;broken seal&#34;. Searching online I came across this amazing tool that fixed the leak in less than 5 min!!! Have been riding for over 250 miles and no seal/fork leak in sight. Best $10 I have spent in a very long time!!!
B005NLQAHS|1|Have tried 2 of these and first one worked for a while then quit connecting and second worked a couple of times after unplugging and plugging in multiple times. Last time I tried to use it it worked and after shutting car off and trying again I never got it to go. Looking for a better unit. Not something used every day so quite some time in between. Want something I can count on
B004QHICJO|5|Installed with no issues. Saved over $100 per bearing.
B0066SLFT0|5|2000 volvo s70 glt 2.4L 5 speed automatic tranny. PCV valve was clogged. Caused all kinds of downstream choking and smoking. Repalced with this bad boy and it runs smooth as silk. Not an easy job, but if you have time and lot of patience, this is a much better buy as a DIY than running the car to the dealer or repair shop. Used APA crankcase vent hose and APA vent hose connector. still hanging on and doing its thing.
B009S9RURU|5|Easy to put on, hard to get off.
B0055QOKC8|5|Genius and simple design is easy to use and has worked very well on two 3000 mile trips.
B000GOG3P6|5|This fan was a perfect match for my 2000 Chrysler T&C (3.8l) and at a considerably better price than i could get from the local parts house. I have found so many Great TYC products for my van.
B000ENOPPO|5|Awesome.
B00BE5IKUM|5|Exact fit! works well and locks match each other with spare keys.. Love it.
B00EDZD5EQ|5|2007 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE 4.7. I'VE RAN IT FOR OVER 2,000 MILES NOW AND I'M VERY PLEASED. ENGINE TEMP STAYS LOW EVEN ON 110 DEGREE DAYS I SPENT IN ARIZONA THIS MONTH. I HAVE A HYPERTECH POWER PROGRAMMER THAT WAS CAUSING THE CAR TO RUN HOT AND OCCASIONALLY OVER HEAT EVEN ON THE LOWEST TUNE SETTING. I HAD TO GO BACK TO STOCK UNTIL ADDING THIS THERMOSTAT WHICH FIXED THE OVERHEATING PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY AND NOW I CAN USE THE HIGHEST TUNE SETTING WITHOUT THE GAUGE EVER EVEN TOUCHING THE HALF WAY MARK ON THE TEMP GAUGE. EVEN IN STOCK TUNE THE MOTOR SEEMED TO PULL A LITTLE HARDER AND RUN BETTER. AND YES IT DOES COME WITH THE REQUIRED SEAL EVEN THOUGH THE DESCRIPTION SAYS IT DOESN'T COME WITH THE GASKET. THAT IS BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A HOUSING GASKET ON THESE CARS LIKE OLDER CARS HAD. THE RUBBER AROUND THE THERMOSTAT DOES THE SEALING. VERY SIMPLE MODICATION THAT I RECOMMEND ANYONE PEFORM EVEN ON A STOCK ENGINE.
B000Q6MGXM|5|Love these deflectors! I have put them on all my SUV's, trucks and vans for the past 20 years. This particular pair is on my new Lincoln MKX. It's nice to be able to crack the windows to let hot air out of the vehicle when it's parked but not have to opening exposed to the elements, nor can anyone tell that the windows are down an inch or so when observing the vehicle. Here in South Florida it gets beastly hot in the summer with the sunshine and being able to vent the windows really helps prevent the heat and pressure build up inside the car when it's parked outside. Since we also get a lot of heavy rain in the summer, with these installed you won't get any rain inside the vehicle when you do leave your windows vented and the skies open up before you get back to your car. They are also nice because you can vent your windows while driving and you don't get all the wind noise from an open window. These are a great invention and I especially like the fact that they are an interference fit and they are not installed with that nasty 2 sided tape. Should you ever damage one of these it's easily removed and you're not prying it off and then getting rid of leftover adhesive and foam tape. These are the best on the market, BAR NONE!
B009OEMJL6|5|door fit fine and works good
B00NQ198LC|5|Perfect fit for Thule Aeroblade bars. The locks work great and having spare keys is always a plus.
B00BSD9W2U|4|When the package arrived I noticed it said something like &#34;Tightest fit available&#34;. They were not kidding......I had to pound the sleeve into my hitch with a piece of wood and 3 pound hammer. Works great once I got done sweating my butt off hammering it in. The hitch slid in without any issues. Good product. I would buy it again.
B001RLOE08|4|tthank you
B00IO4EYMY|5|Great buy on quality refrigerant when you need more than just 1 0r 2 cans.  I am very pleased....and it was delivered quickly.
B00CBI1Y3G|5|Excellent seller, delivered as promised. Product awesome as manufacturer states. Have it on a bicycle down tube and stuck on with no issues for about a year now.
B000C7YQ24|5|Works great on my 2006 Tacoma. Push the cap in and twist 3 clicks.
B002W2R700|5|Its lasting
B003Z9T33I|5|Fits perfect. Very easy to take off and put back on. Just seems a lot more practical over a hard top cover!
B0065UN0K6|5|They were the same plugs as O.E. and improved the gas mileage over the originals that had 95,000 miles.
B00VS7PUTK|1|The Battle flag in the Canton is upside down.... I had to liberate it, and just use the battle flag on my tailgate
B00V5QDISO|5|I like this product very much.
B00UGGF8S2|2|POORLY MADE.  I should probably just return it.  Not impressed at all.
B006G2JMX2|5|Good
B00B301KOQ|5|good quality tool
B00Y5KPSTY|5|very good like the picture
B00684TAYY|5|Easy peasy setup and looks like the original.
B004043M7U|5|Excellent!!!!! Will purchase and recommend in future...thank you!!!!
B0016KBS3Q|1|Not what I was wanting. How do I send them back.
B00KTHWXYU|1|Wasted my time going to the locksmith and trying to program these worthless fobs.<br /><br />Don't make the same mistake!
B0053GJZJI|2|Arrived GREASY,DIRTY AND UPPER PORTION OF TOOL WAS BENT. Looks like it has been used. I cleaned and bent back and am hoping it does not bend when I go to use it. If it does I will change review to 1 star. IT SEEMS PRETTY CHEAPLY MADE.
B00AFBXQNC|5|great product!!!!!!!!!  love the way it smells and clean
B001J7GBL0|4|Makes the car look much better.
B001LNLM8E|5|nice
B00HXC908Q|5|well engineered, quality workmanship
B00E5NO07W|5|thank you so much thank you
B00498YJL0|1|was supposed to be a locking gas cap; locked it and it came right off with a twist
B00DSD57DG|4|I misjudged the size of this sticker. It is a nice sticker and would of got the 6' had I realized the size. Just big enough for a tablet or phone, not a car.
B00RV83UUG|5|WOW this thing is bright! Put it on top of my Subaru and light the way!! wired it up to a toggle switch by my e-brake so it is easily switched on and off while driving. Havent had any condensation issues like others have said, and the bar i a perfect size when mounting inside the rack cage atop the subie. I rarely use high beams anymore...only time I use the highs is when i beam someone to go or if someone does something stupid. Don't want to use the bar for that because it'll give them immediate Lasik :)
B00G2TV7OG|5|these have been working fine for a few months now. much brighter than the stock halogens, and were direct replacements.
B004964AM0|1|Terrible product.
B001FAIAJ2|5|Great fit! Adds more air to my cab through the vent! It does have a slant on the top tho water can come straight down but provides more cover than a normal vent
B00LBVV7AO|2|I purchased these bulbs to replace my interior RV lights.  The bulbs arrived quickly, and when installed worked fine - at first.  The light is rather blue, as another reviewer mentioned, not a warm white.  I was willing to live with that for the ability to lower my electrical usage, but I started noticing after a few days that the bathroom seemed darker, then the kitchen seemed darker.  After a week, my husband and I both were like....it's really dark in here....  When we began to investigate and pulled the covers off of our light fixtures, we discovered that every single light had stopped working on the sides, and that only the end LED's were lit.  Several had become rather loose, as well, so that when we removed the lights by pushing and twisting, the LED part itself was all sloppy and moving in its base.  I'm returning them.
B0013FTZUC|5|Exact fit no problems installing
B00F2OARPM|5|Good price. Great quality!
B000LUBQ4I|5|so far so good
B00UMQ5P8O|3|Mounting screws rusted
B000CI6YIC|1|The pressure plate is weak and caused me to have to take my clutch adjustments to their limits to make up for the weak clutch fingers of the pressure-plate.  If you own a Nissan Frontier,...buy the Exedy clutch which is OEM. It's a little bit more money than the LUK junk...but it will give you a nice firm high clutch pedal instead of the low-height spongy pedal from the LUK clutch system...I replaced my clutch master and slave cylinder when I installed this clutch kit..both were bled properly, but the pedal is way too soft and doesn't travel as far as it should....Trust me,...buy another brand!
B0007LZK9I|5|Nice quality hitch pin came in a timely manner
B0097X6730|4|We purchased this mattress for our camper to replace the thin, no support mattress that came with it. My husband and I aren't small people and this supports us well.  Some of the other reviews say that people sink to the bottom of the mattress and that is not the case with ours.  It gives quite a bit of support and is actually quite comfortable once we got used to it. My husband loved it from the first night and I have gotten used to it and love it also. It's an adjustment going from a sleep number bed at home to this mattress for the first night but after that, it's just as comfy.  Husband loaded it into the camper himself ( but he did say it was quite heavy) and we let it expand overnight. There weren't any smells with off gassing. We do not use any sort of a box spring, it's just on a piece of plywood and it's still very comfortable. I would recommend  this mattress for anyone looking to replace the generic flat mattress  included in campers. You will not regret your decision.
B00WW885DM|5|I ordered these because the stock hood struts wore out. I received the products within two days and in a padded envelope with no damage. Removal of the old and installation of the new only took the use of a flat head screwdriver, very simple. They work great, I would highly recommend this product, company, and sellers to anyone looking.
B0015DMNIS|5|This is a great puller set.  Very well made.  I am never disappointed with OTC
B003YLH942|5|Perfect fit and it does the job for a fraction of the OEM price. Been working just fine for over two years, I'm very happy with it.
B006C52KLE|5|Very pleased :)
B005PPU5U0|5|FAST SHIPPING... PERFECT FIT FOR MY APPLICATION&#62;&#62; GREAT PRICE FOR THIS QUALITY PRODUCT !!!!
B000AA4RWM|2|One was cracked in package.
B006WKQZUQ|5|very nice cover for the price
B009NQ8JGO|5|Fit my car perfectly so if you have a 2012 nissan sentra this is the part. Very good rubber material.
B00180FIV2|5|Everything went well.
B00NICVEE8|5|worked perfectly
B005VKVD8C|5|Could not be more pleased
B002305A1E|4|cheap, decent made but vibrate really bad
B009S9RURU|5|This is the second time I have ordered this for a car and it still makes me smile every time I see it! its a great way to establish safety for your car with precious cargo while keeping your goofy integrity.
B00LC1MH0M|1|Not much light from these  supposed to be running lights..<br />Would not well even on a bicycle ..<br />Very sad  Hard to see  in sun light,,,<br />Very low light even at night..
B004OK77L2|5|Fit and finish was spot on. Seems very strong. I am using it to lift about 3K pounds. A bit faster than others I have had in the past. The lights are a huge plus in the dark.
B004L035UW|5|good item
B00RV83UUG|5|Impressed with this light bar, very bright. I took the end caps off and sealed them with silicone before i even mounted it, and i haven't had any trouble with water or condensation.  I wouldn't consider it a 24 inch light bar though because the the lens is only 20 inches, it is 24 inches bracket to bracket. Overall I am happy with the bar and I would buy it again!
B004ZF4930|1|I'm mechanically inclined and took me about 90 minutes to install, no problem, but both lights quit working after nine days.  Checked all fuses & connections, still no lights.  This put me in a bad situation since I travel at night.  Luckily, I had the original factory bulbs in my glove box and was able to install those in a rest area so I had lights.
B008XLPP9E|3|I try to park close to the curb to avoid getting my mirror taking off and now I'm looking at these kits. These only work on alloy wheels so make sure the rims aren't chrome. The whole process took about an hour. The reading took a bit becaue i wanted to get it right. Long story short it did a pretty good job on some medium curb marks. I did it by hand and imagine it would be better if you attach it to the drill, but you can do it either way. For the time and effort the results are decent. I thought the last stage bonding would stick alittle better. Though suprisingly the sanders worked really well.  Anyway, next time I'm spending the dough and taking it to the shop to save time and to have it look professional.
B0081ZVBDQ|5|It does what it claims to do.
B002VF0H5A|5|Fit perfectly working just fine no problems
B000A6Z950|5|fit like a glove
B0051TLE14|4|Love it but looks used I mean some scratch on it:(<br />But I'm put it on anyway.
B00WIZZL0O|3|Very brught, but contacts are way too thin. had to move and bend to make contact.
B00DQJ9GWU|3|One of the plastic adapters that came with the product broke first time I installed it on my 15 Tacoma.  Luckily, the antenna still looks good without the spacer so I didn't bother to return it.  Reception does go bad with this antenna.  I live near a large city so I still get good channels, but for someone who is not, I do not recommend this product.  It stand up great to car washed and seems to withstand weather conditions fairly well.
B000HE6BYS|4|Product worked well, but was a bit difficult to use.  Had hoped to use again, but was not able to.
B005ER6Q5C|4|As with most of Curt hitches this is a good quality product. I bought this hitch for my 2012 Sienna mainly for bike racks & to keep it low profile which in part does the job but in retrospect I should have gotten the class 3 as it would have saved me money in not having to buy adapters & other things that make it more complicated w/ 1 1/4&#34; size hitch. Also, it would give me better peace of mind not having to think about the lesser capacity of only 250 lbs tongue weight. Overall, I'm satisfied as it is lower profile & not quite as noticeable. Also, because the minivan is pretty low, this may be better suited as it probably gives a slight better clearance so less scrape or drag.
B0065LTR98|1|Worthless piece of plastic
B000CRFKTM|5|Always  great product.
B005RF6G4M|2|It's way too big in its collapsed state. You have to roll the thing up like a yoga mat and it ends up being very cumbersome to store somewhere. The shade is decently thick, providing some pretty good insulation - but that makes it so huge to store. We don't even use this anymore. We got one of those ones that fold up very small.
B00KAWR7S6|5|Received very quickly and it was exactly what we needed!!
B00DP100HY|4|Didn't realize I would be seeing red through them, very cool glasses though.
B004ZVZNPM|4|Good brightness but as any LED, very directional.
B001GC2LVM|4|Saves having to stack wood to get level.  Still need someone to observe as it will roll off other end, if not careful.
B0012V11SQ|5|They arrived on time. They were easy to install and fit great.
B0086OE2FQ|5|Excellent quality shoulder pads.  Look great and perform their function well.
B00076FM3W|1|To hard of an inside hurts crown of you head!!!
B001P281UI|5|They pop against the Gold Bullion wheels. Well worth the price, would purchase another set if ever needed.
B001P6GONU|4|Exactly what my husband needed for his new job
B0009JKI5Y|5|Fits perfectly on my 2013 Nissan Altima. Easy to install.
B0006IX85K|5|Good quality, perfect link to my garden drip hose.
B000C9O7R6|4|Replacement parts for F350. Good quality went in with no issues. Like the grease-able feature.
B0083H5RDM|5|Worked as described.
B00AXRRF26|5|Was able to pop it right in and have had it for about a year and it hasn't fallen off and still is good as new!
B000IYR452|5|Product works as advertised and performs as it should.
B00CRT8EGO|1|They are super skinny<br />The pix are not good<br />Fits a child
B008Y9E05U|5|Fit my 07 perfectly exactly what i needed
B001FMCWCQ|4|Good quality, cheaper than OEM and looks like the bushings will last.
B0031HE0BY|5|Awesome part. Great OEM replacement. No complaints!
B00AJZFI44|5|German made, quality filters.  Just installed them this morning.  Fit perfectly.
B00BUARVM4|5|Fast Delivery! Great product!
B009F5NN96|3|Received, thank you. Passenger side had more scratches then expected but the main thing is that they work for noW.
B00FDHY0RO|2|Does not fit 2008 chevy cobalt
B000V2SVFS|5|Nice price !!  +++
B004A0ZLSC|5|Fits like a glove.
B005ET4D0K|5|love them... fast shipping thank you
B004DEBBPM|4|It's realy strong.
B0074JO6CI|5|Perfect part! Felt good seeing a mopar dealer sticker on the box
B004BTJG9M|5|So far, so good!
B00IMCCP3S|1|Piece of s***
B00BHQ5URO|5|delivered on time  ...every thing went into place perfectly
B00480J4KA|5|Works great saved me $40
B006R7AW6M|5|awesome i wish i knew about this item before two years ago
B00N3P2BHY|4|It works good..
B006EGAIJ2|5|Already used several times, works great with my Mustang
B00H3J6A5U|5|You can really feel the difference this air cleaner made from the first time I put in on my Corvette.
B001TI5IIQ|5|This stuff is pretty amazing.<br /><br />After hitting a deer, I had one 15-year-old headlight and one brand new one. After about 30 minutes of elbow grease, it was difficult to tell them apart. I wish I had taken before and after photos. It's that good. And cheap.
B00CAYBLJI|2|Not able to use. The kuryakyn parts are great but I'm unable to mount them in a way that does not interfere with the brake or gear shift. The problem is  the suzuki factory highway bars.
B00LBAC5S8|4|Installation was not easy. I eventually sorted it out. You do have to unclip the front corners in order to close the soft top (there is no way around that). I have not yet tried it with the hard top, but it appears the back clips should come off (they don't have to if you leave the screws out, which I do) as well as the front two. I love the shade itself once installed. If done correctly, it remains taut and does well at blocking enough sun but still leaving you with an &#34;open air&#34; feeling. They should come up with a better clipping mechanism that allows it to remain fully on with the hard/soft top connected, or make it much easier to install/remove.
B0041TOOHQ|4|Just as expected.
B0001CMUV4|5|These work very well to stabilize the different extensions I use on my hitch.  On my truck receiver I have mud flaps to protect my 5th wheel. The hitch tightener works well to stabilize the mud flaps. On my 5th wheel I use the hitch tightener to stabilize my bike rack.  So far so good! Love the product and would recommend it to everyone.
B001810SHA|5|Totally worked, my A/C was cycling on and hot air was coming out.  A quick reading with this gauge confirmed that low freon was the culprit.  This fixed everything.
B00IBORY7Y|5|Awesome! I love these. The coverage is great and the material is much better than any other I'm seen.
B004ZIV9GW|5|Worked as intended.
B00XINZ8TO|5|Fits nicely on my Toyota Camry. The mirrors are very clear and easy to install. Definitely does the job of seeing your blind spots. Also it was nice that you can rotate it to get the right angle. Probably only need to adjust it once but nice feature.  Would recommend.
B004OHOC0Y|5|Excellent buy!  Holes lined up perfectly on my 89 wrangler.  Very solid and well made light mount.
B000X21WRU|4|Seem thinner than previous years but still a good fit.
B00CODHZ4U|2|Low Quality.. hooks snapped when trying to attach. The underwire was visible and they looked as if they would fall off easily. I returned them. Spend extra and get the kind that are attached via the lugnuts if your car has that option.
B000E4NKE0|5|fit like a glove, so easy to open now
B00429NKWK|1|It only lasted the summer. After winter the headlights were cloudy again.
B007Z8VG30|3|Smaller than you'd think but I made use of it...
B003C01FHW|5|This is the switch you are looking for.
B002GO784Y|5|Great product. Fit perfectly on my 2014 ram 1500. It literally only took like 15 minutes to put on.
B00ELHNM3K|4|Lubricates Engines!
B0007OWD2M|5|No streaks
B005IFCFPK|5|Nice to have for easy storage.
B005EPLJ9W|5|It fit in like a glove. It works amazing. Such an improvement over the old window switches that didn't work.
B0009IQZH0|5|Outstanding Product.
B009EXEYJC|5|Great product , well pleased
B008988S4K|3|FYI, this is NOT the carbeurator that comes stock with Zenoah G23LH. That being said, it still fits.
B004VGAJOG|4|This is the second time I needed to change the door handles. Although they work well once changed, they are prone to wear and ultimately break. This is an engineering problem and components in the door handle could be of higher quality.
B00JYMZ8HK|3|Pretty good for price but will melt plug on camper, very poor design on female plug very loose connection which causes low voltage and amp input to camper, plug will overheat and melt.
B00IB4LT20|5|It was wat I was looking for thxs
B00CWNVAPW|5|perfect
B00252JBP6|5|Perfect fit just like OEM
B003XZQQZM|1|I used this on my sofa set about a year ago. Originally I was very pleased with the results. As time has gone by the product has sort of slid on the leather. On the large sofa we use the most, just the seat, the product has moved and bunched and gathered in spots. It's thick and I can almost scratch it off. It truly looks worse now than it did a year ago. Now it looks like I spilled something all over the sofa. The chair that we rarely sit in had a few scratch marks on the arm and that still looks great, but I think it's b/c we don't use it at all. I have the leftover that I had saved in a cabinet and I'm going to throw it out ASAP. I wouldn't recommend this at all.
B00SB34YIW|5|Great Product...
B00GSAUHB8|5|I live in Miami FL and find the leather interior of the car cooler than before. Not 100% cool, but I can drive without scorching my hands when placed on steering wheel. Easy to fold and store in the pouch Well worth the cost. Costumer service is excellent, as the company has contacted me to ensure item was received and I am 100% satisfied.
B0012TRNTY|5|Good Stuff
B0016OKKJK|5|looks like factory installed
B005DBN5BC|2|Its cute but mine had a stain on hello kitty and the cds easily fall out!
B007FTV9Q8|5|excellent
B009CMNFHM|5|Work just fine.
B00CIJPU74|5|My brother loved it.
B00MH4663C|4|Bolt Power G06 Portable 600 AMP....<br />I normally wait about 30 days to do a review. However, I was quite impressed with the Bolt Power G06 right out of the box.  It arrived from Amazon in a timely manner.  It was well packaged/boxed via priority mail.  It was at least 75% charged right out of the box.<br /><br />My 2003 Audi Allroad, for whatever reason, will periodically not start due to the battery being mysteriously drained.  I had purchased a new battery from Auto Zone; and it appeared to happen more often than not.  I had the AZ battery recharged by AZ a couple of times; to no avail – same results.  I tried a battery from Sears; and it performed better than the Auto Zone battery – in the sense, the car battery didn’t seem to deplete, or die on me as often.  In any event, the car battery had eventually died again.  I left it for 3 days this time.  The Bolt Power G06 arrived.  I follow the instructions (very simple).  I hooked the cables to the battery terminals; attached the device to the other end of cables; pressed the power button on device.  I got in my Allroad; put the key in, the lights on dash displayed immediately (unlike before due to dead battery).  I started the key; and vehicle started up right away after sitting for 3 days ‘dead as a door knob’.  Of course, I will try to pin point why this happens with the battery – but, for now, I am quite pleased with this purchase.  It’s a good feeling to know, when my battery dies, I do not have to ask anyone for a jump.  It worked like a charm.  I would highly recommend.  kp
B00D8RYGOI|5|For the price it's great
B0091OE6II|5|A small about to pay for comfort while driving. Easy to use.
B007PBPI68|5|Thanks, item is as described and is working very well
B003X9TLUK|5|Excellent replacement quick shipment
B000CGKMKK|5|Fit perfect work just oem
B000BUQODG|5|Bought two and liked them so much just bought two more so all the rv vents will have a cover. Easy to install. Tools required: drill, drill bit, phillips screwdriver, and a pair of pliers. To install two of them took me approximately 1/2 hour. You will need someone inside the trailer to raise and lower your vent to make it easy to line up.
B00FW66ATW|5|Excellent product, great price, fast shipping.
B011AE5JW8|4|Received it soon after ordering. Look well made for the price. It looks very similar to other lithium battery jump starters all over the web--maybe most of them are from the some town in China.<br />I haven't tried it to start a car (hopefully not!). It came in half-charged and was charged full within 2 hours with the AC-DC adaptor, and the flashlight is quite bright. So far pretty good.
B001AJH1HK|5|they work, they fit, easy to install, 5 minutes and you are ready to go
B0031I2MMM|5|Fits perfectly.
B00GT2FUB2|5|Very nice product. I had the misfortune of using it to start 1800cc Victory Vision (thanks to the stupid trunk light staying on for who-knows-how-long).  Pulled this out, bike started immediately.  Also charges cell phones in a bind!  Definitely worth the price, if it saves one tow, it's paid for....I have no idea how many years the battery will really last, but when it comes time to replace I will definitely be buying a new one.
B007S0LDME|5|Have used this product for over six months and it works, is economical and easy to use. Would recommend this product as an answer to any fellow RVer's toilet/black tank maintainance regime.
B0029TQDLA|5|great item
B00U6IGW6W|5|Looks awesome! Came quickly! I love it! Any true geek will!
B00H4JKLCM|4|Needed to bend the bracket to fit. Otherwise did the job.
B0047DGVTK|5|Good affordable product.  Great improvement to my ride.  Easy install for a first timer!
B00S2U6BM6|4|good deal
B00H9KHA4S|5|really keeps car cooler.  Learning curve is steep for installation but quickly gets easier.
B004LF6KUE|5|Good product fast shipping
B00ECHY33C|5|Great
B00WA1U7MS|5|This tool is handy and compact.  The emergency features are a must have in any vehicle.  The illuminated gauge is a bonus.  Well worth the price.
B00KX1109Q|5|Excellent light for the money.  It surely lights up the trails for my RZR 1000 4.  I feel that the 30 degree LEDs could project the beam further out beyond my high beams, however, the light is more than adequate in totally lighting up the trail, both up front, as well as on both sides.  It is a great buy, with good quality parts, mounts are very steady and strong, and does the job very well.  I would recommend this to anyone who needs to have much more light on the trail than is offered by the manufacturer's LED headlights, which incidentally do a good job by themselves.
B00042LC9M|5|good price. promptly received..
B00DNX92TQ|5|It's a small bag but that is what I was looking for. It will hold a couple of cans of soda and some candy bars, glasses, etc. The magnets are strong, like other reviews I cut off the straps, I use it on a CBR250. I checked out other sites and this is a good deal, couldn't find anything for less than $50.
B00X8J7VUW|4|Put these in my 01 Qx4 with factory hids. I was tired of messing with bulbs and ballasts/igniters. I had to bypass my stock ballast and hardwire these in. They fit in the housing great with a little finesse,  the only problem is the led lights have a female harness. I knew my factory plug wouldn't fit into this female harness but it should of came with a male plug to go into there and give you two wires coming out. Luckily I am a car audio installer so I cut the plug off and verified the polarity of both led and factory wires. They work great so far 2 days old well see how they hold up. Not as bright as my hids but very close these I believe are 3000lms per bulb and hids produce 3200-3400lms. Overall seems legit I was very skeptical at first.
B0007KQY3K|5|Product was as advertised, works great fast shipping AAAA  ++++
B00T36U31I|4|The AB Catalytic 41417 was easy to put on. It fit right up to every thing. No leaks at all. I was happy with it, and the price was right.It only took about 15 min. to put it on after I got the old one off.
B000GS354E|5|Looks great sounds great easy install
B0086RQ5BM|1|The one I got was defective. Returned it last week and waiting for the refund to try again. Guess we will see what happens
B000MDZLQ8|4|Perfect replacement!
B003FG4SKE|1|both bulbs burned out in 1 month!....and they were installed properly without touching the glass.
B004HCOE72|5|Worked great on my headlights... Mine just happened to have round edges so I wasn't able to remove the yellowing completely on the edges.
B004HE1YSW|4|While these are not of the highest quality, they work well on the rear of my truck.  I understand that these are made in Asia and sold under the GM label to compete with the other aftermarket brake pads.  I saw mixed reports on these pads, but like any other review, I always discount the top and bottom statements as providers or competitors and look for the most common report.  They're good.<br />I plan to use a better quality pad on the front where most of the braking is done, but plan to buy another set of these pads to fit my suburban which has the same brakes.
B000CB42I8|5|Fixed all my problems.
B00PJ9BTF2|3|The wrap was packaged in a very tight roll (the 2'×5' roll had the diameter of a dime) making it necessary to unroll and smooth using a heat gun and an another person before installing. In my opinion the vinyl can't be streched to wrap anything that isn't for the most part flat.
B0024E71BQ|5|It worked out great exactly what I needed
B000FAKNM0|1|Terrible product. Came broken and bent. I was able to fix it but the quality is very poor. I would give it a negative star if it was possible.
B000COX0MY|4|as described.  convenient
B0041TRSHY|5|it's filtering air!
B00008RW9U|5|dusts car, not by itself, I have to hold it.
B00EY2PJ4M|2|Long term the plating no good, Short term the bolt was too short
B000C9WL6A|5|Great fit and function
B00P1LALI4|3|Good product but they put the adhesive on the wrong side if I put it on the way they said it would rip off the first time on the free way
B0013FFPX8|3|It serves the purpose but I was incredibly surprised that the white line was not the same width of the existing knobs on the radio...and the black was a little duller...it is more noticable than the existing knobs on the radio....(there were others that posted similar comments)...especially since this was an OEM part and cost more than $10.
B004EASEQE|1|i'm returing them. i have a 3/8&#34; gap to the fender
B00TQ07IOQ|3|They are as wide or heavy duty as described.
B00KTHSJBQ|4|Beware that if your fob's battery is in the middle, you will have to cut the battery slot on the back lid out so the circuit board can go in there.  Apparently, so GM fobs have it so you insert the battery in the lid, then close it up.  I thought they were all the same.  Oh well.  It works.
B003VCCUJI|5|Use this and you will never strip an oil pan, and far less likely to get dirty or burned changing oil. I put these on all my cars for years - never an issue/problem. Highly recommended.
B00F2OM8LI|5|Saved a ton over a factory part and it's working fine.
B003Z9UUUS|3|Would be a five star if the stitching would have lasted as long as the rest of it. Still a great product and would recommend to anyone.
B00R77L02Q|2|This is NOT an exact replacement radiator for a 1995 Dodge Dakota Sport with a 3.9 V6!!!  The inlet and outlets are smaller than the OEM.  Also, the inlet (top) is situated towards the middle and the shroud cannot be used unless modified because the new inlet location interferes with it. Another thing is the automatic cooling ports are 1/4 inch not 3/8th inches,  It took me two and a half days to install instead of 1/2 a day.  I do like the build but the application in terrible!
B001P2DTY6|5|On my 2008 Honda Element LX, this thing was EASY. The product looks a little different from the image on here, but it works great.
B00LPSOAX4|4|I purchased for my hubbie to do minor repairs on my car... mission accomplished.
B00NLM3SOO|5|Professional
B0096062K2|4|its not the color in the picture but it work, ill let you guys know how long!
B0006JO0XI|3|I think it is charging? Not sure I like the design.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|These are pretty darn good rags
B00TA5ECJQ|5|First off, you can tell this thing is made well as soon as you pick it up.  The hoses feel very supple and substantial and the bulb feels like heavy quality rubber.  There is nothing about this product that says &#34;Cheap China Junk&#34;  I used it to pump old oil out of a mower, pressure washer, & a pump & it worked great.  It was not a super fast process, you have to squeeze the bulb and let it re-expand and I kind of had to work the bulb with my fingers to get it to re-expand to some degree, I would imagine because of the vacuum pressure.  But definitely this thing creates a very strong suction and gets the old oil out.  Ran some dish soap through it for clean up.  I am very pleased with the quality and function of this item.
B00BFE5ZRS|3|Nissan should admit fault on this original never worked right and made us almost crash on several occasions due to improper electrical management with original ipdm.<br />This new one has remedied a lot of issues with the vehicle, it would be great if Cheapsan would right me a check for all the trouble caused by the faulty original equipment. Car manufacturer's seem to not care anymore. Sucks it took me 10 years to figure out what this huge problem was finally on blog titan talk.<br />Anyway very happy with new IPDM old one was always junk even when brand new.
B008Y8Q8HE|5|THANK YOU
B00IV66SF6|5|It fits perfectly.
B0121KHQIK|1|The antenna is not contoured, so it did not fit properly on roof.  It is flat, my roof is not. I was very disappointed!!!
B007P740IE|1|Excellent!!! If you want wrong parts... Not worth 0.01 cent crappy made gasket set..
B001JDE6ZW|5|Got these mirrors so I would be legal. Easy install and removal. I try to keep the top off the Jeep as much as possible. Got them in just a day or two.
B001LHVOVK|5|This is a must have for all cars. Buy one for each of your cars and you're set.
B004ZF43Y0|5|I've installed dozens of HID kits and this is one of the better ones at this price point. I've been running the bulbs and ballasts for over 5,000 miles without incident.
B007IW5K3U|5|Damn....this thing is really strong.....I love it.....the original blower never blew this hard
B00BTL6FRG|2|Okay for the 1st 6-10 months, but as mentioned in other posts, once they start flickering...done! They get really hot and it's not long after that before they burn out. Bummer...Thought I finally found a nicely priced product.
B0009OMY9C|5|Good
B00BN453DG|5|A nice Fob to go with my keyless starter. This is a quality GM product.
B00BOFTOP2|5|Works as advertised.  No noticeable signal AM/FM.  Looks much better that factory.  Simple install.
B003NQVDXQ|4|painted to match candy apple look great, keep the rain out in Florida while I smoke.
B010C7UGK4|5|As described, looks great.
B00WFHWYZU|5|works great
B0017LUZII|5|I am glad I ordered right one.<br />Nice fit for my 2001 Honda Accord Cat.<br />(But you will need Walker 31383 Gasket too because front and back are different shape)
B00U37G6IA|2|**** update ****<br />unfortunately, quality at that price just doesn't happen. decided to put down my higher priced riding pants for these, and they proved to be too good to be true.<br />for some reason a portion on the shin melted, on the heat shield, and now i have a mess of burnt polyester or plastic that is killing me in cleaning.<br />they are useless and now will be thrown... not really up for modifying them..<br />*****************<br /><br />I was afraid that this would be an over-pant as the description is not really complete, tried to look for descriptions on other sites but didn’t really find any solid info.<br /><br />The quality is good, at that price I’m happy, other pants I have that run in the high $200 to $300-hundreds are in a totally deferent class. So don’t expect that kind of quality.<br /><br />So, it’s not an over pant which was exactly what I was looking for a summer riding pant. At the temperatures I ride in, naked would be the way to go,,, but that has social and other implications. The armor on the knees and sides are a nice addition, knee protection and thickness of the shin portion is great protection from small stones.<br /><br />The legs have zippers inside and Velcro on the bottom legs and waist, reviewers have mentioned issues with snaps on the waist and true they don’t hold very well. The waist Velcro is the only way to adjust and hold up these pants, you can’t run a belt around these unfortunately. I guess if you intend to modify anything it would be the snaps and belt, an extra cost for a good tailor.<br /><br />All in all I would ****not**** recommend this product.<br /><br />I am a fat 38 tall, the XXL fit nicely and comfortably would have loved the tall. Not sure if it was a mistake or that what but when received these are labeled as short, so make sure of your measurements before as the XXL (that are not described as short in Amazon) are actually short (and labeled so inside the pants).
B0057Y5EFK|5|So a few years ago I cut down a cheap Chinese made 12 point socket to do IPR's and it served me well. This one has just the right height so it is easier to squeeze in those cramped Ford engine bays. The size isn't really beneficial on International's DT series engines since there's plenty of room *cough cough* except on some of the newer Work Star series trucks. In that case there's no easy way in there and this socket becomes even more valuable as it fits in those tight spots.
B001DKOXSQ|1|Doesn't adhere well
B009OONK46|2|Okay, this thing will get you out of a jam but only worked for a couple months. It just runs a small hydraulic pump and had plenty of voltage. I checked power, ground, voltage drops, etc. All were great. A replacement motor that cost me a few hundred more from the original manufacturer is what it took to finally get things going again. Given my issues the seller was prompt in sending out a replacement motor but that replacement is still in the box.
B00MOKMTLW|5|fit on my 2000 Tundra like a glove and it  made the  truck look nice
B002807VWU|1|wrong one
B00AZJYDQI|5|I bought this to air up my 125 psi trailer tires, as I like a little distance between me and the tire when going to that pressure.  This puppy works like a charm.  I attach it to the valve stem, back away to fill the tire (to the compressor controls), then when completed, detach it.  Makes it very easy to attach and detach to & from valve stem.  There is essentially no air loss when connecting or disconnecting.  Very happy with this device.
B00X7HS5LY|5|The Car Sunshade Grande Jumbo 11 was big. (As the name suggests)  I didnt get down and take any exact measurements. But i was worried it would be to big to fit in my vehicle. Thanks to the way its made  I was able to shape it to where I needed it. The shade is made of a black and gray shiny material.  It fully covers the whole front of the vehicle. I was happy  to be offered  this product for free for sharing my honest unbiased opinion.
B004MXN71U|5|Better than original
B008ZCGZUY|5|had to change a broken handle on the inside of car door. these came in quite handy! made it much easier to remove the inside door panel! highly recommended!
B00L9VWAUC|5|Perfect fit for 2003 Mustang GT
B002E40ZFA|5|Works awesome!
B00FBPWO0S|5|Just what we were looking for. This carpet is huge!
B00CLQZ63M|1|junk did not fit seller charge aloot to return buyer beware
B001898WRA|4|Pros: So much easier in the summer to toss these guys on when it appears its going to rain. I use just the lower door for wheeling to keep brush from slapping me. Gives a really great look when on.<br />Cons: Loud on the highway, but I expected that. Pain in the but to get the passenger door to fit right. If the weather stripping isn't placed just right it will leak.<br /><br />Overall this is just what I needed for spring thru fall, to quickly adapt to the weather in my two door jeep jk.
B000X23Y5S|5|Super easy install and it looks great!
B0007VANHC|5|went in just like they said . was done in 45 min. would have been faster if i had a hand . was cumbersome by myself and i had to drop the spare tire down . sticks out a bit farther than i like but it was made to work with the spare and mine is right at the edge of the bumper
B000COS06A|5|Have matching locks on both my pickup and the trailer it pulls. Also put their lug nuts on the pickup. A nice upgrade. Have used McGards for years and these are even better than before.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Simple to use and worked great.  Great service from Amazon. (I do not care what the New York Times said).
B0006O2S8M|5|Was dubious about these but a year after installation they hold pressure and make checking &#34;remote&#34; spares, ie: under chassis pickup tires, immeasurably easier. Work perfectly.
B000CITK8S|5|Great value for the money.  Works perfectly in keeping the battery on my classic car charged.
B0015KTWJE|5|great fit, no problems
B00BMU98AK|5|These hubcaps are lightweight plastic, but are pretty easy to install and look very good!  Just be careful when installing them because they snap onto your rim very tightly.  I found an extra pair of hands helped because we could hold the hubcap in place and apply steady pressure to keep it from moving around while tapping the hubcap gently with a rubber mallet to snap it in place.
B005HJMX4U|1|Don't buy this. It fell off my car in a week and I no longer have a spare key.
B00BUIEWYQ|5|great products. Thanks
B00LCMAWEY|5|Fits good easy to install
B00Z7KIZPA|1|Hate it. Doesn't have flexibility. Too far away to put purse in before I get in. Wanted to do that because of neck issues
B005JUX1S4|5|It's a good complete package, but you will either need a modicum of mechanical aptitude to figure out the air line and wire routing or you'll be far better off to just pay someone else to do it. They suggest that the compressor and manifold can be mounted outside of the vehicle but then they say to protect them from water and dust. I found a spot under the rear seat that is out of the way.
B001DKRKGS|1|Made of thin plastic, will not hold my 32oz big buddy cup....first time I used cup holder,  water went all over my truck....product is useless.
B000O5EZLQ|3|the straps could be better
B0000AYYU1|5|It was a great kit and was installed without any issue.  Time will tell how long it last and I will update three years from now.
B00AYZB6Z4|4|Good for the price
B00D9W0IYE|5|Subdued, not garish, which I very much appreciate. Snap to install with several form of connectors.
B00063WM1Q|5|Works right out the box. Light is brite. No extra wires in the way.
B000CPC5OW|5|prime my engine like 3 times it cover really well
B00HKG80Z4|4|Good looking and servers the purpose.  Great size.  Only reason it is not 5 starts is the lighter metal than used on a lot of truck boxes, but the price is pretty good.  I've had mine for about a month now and it gets stepped on sat on, etc with no real damage
B001AHI1U8|1|This thing will not stick to any surface in my classroom.  Some reviewers have stated it could be screwed to wall for permanent display but that would require buying additional hardware.
B0042KL8BY|5|This is the best detail spray on the market!! I've tried them all and Griots is hands down the best!!
B002DPHDF0|5|great replacement on my pontoon trailer
B00UZUL360|4|This decal is very cute and I'm in love with it. I ordered it for my 11in macbook air and put it on my hard shell. Pay attention to the sellers details because if you want a different size and color, then you have to contact the seller (like what I did). Otherwise you will just get the 13&#34; decal.<br />It's difficult to get the mop hair part of her costume to stay on the surface when you try to take the transfer tape off. It's not a press and peel type of decal, you have to be patient and slow with peeling off the transfer tape.
B000CQOO9K|5|Made in japan as promised.
B00RDYOFD4|5|Nice. I have no complaints
B00JU65OP6|5|Perfect!
B00EDN49KM|5|Amazing. Fantastic quality, put it on my front bumper. :) matches my car well, too. I have a yellow cobalt.
B00E6M2F6K|4|fit well, everything works as it should, but i now have a problem with the puddle light staying on for a long time, might be a programming issue. good product for the price
B000UVGK5I|5|Fits perfectly and has enough structure and thickness to stand up with barely any help from the visors.  It makes a big difference in interior temperature and keeps the steering wheel and dash nice and cool to touch.  Wish I had purchased this one YEARS ago!  It replaced a shade that was make-do and was so floppy that I had to fight with it every time I placed it.  Yes, this sunshade takes a few seconds to roll up and secure properly but it is well worth those extra seconds.  The shade arrived in a nice long box that protected it well during shipment.
B009SDC46S|2|Received incorrect bulb for the trunk/ cargo area that would not fit so could not install. Installation was easy for the map light and a little trickier for the step/ courtesy lights, but both were plug and play. The LED door courtesy lights look much cleaner than the halogen ones; however, both the map and courtesy lights aren't especially bright. The map light doesn't add more brightness than the original halogen one and at night it is pretty dim. The most it does is add a blueish white hue to your car at night, but don't expect it to help when you're looking for something in the dark.<br /><br />Amazon has a great return policy and I would've sent the lights back had I known I received the wrong one, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of uninstalling all the LEDs. Be sure to check all the bulbs you receive before installation to make sure they fit. Personally I'd go for brighter LEDs if I decide to swap them out in the future.
B00PGH5UZC|5|Great item at a reasonable price.  A perfect fit for my CX-5 keyless fob.  Nice leather and several different attachment options.  Fast delivery.
B00Q5JRHP6|5|Works anywhere!!
B00AC6XR0W|5|I bought these because my previous ones were creating excessive noise. These pads are quiet as a whisper and provide perfectly adequate braking power.
B00D8I5VSM|5|Great item! Thank you! It fit perfectly and works excellent!
B000C9Q3AU|5|Fit my 2003 Honda Odyssey EXL good and is working fine so far after 200 miles of city pot hole filled driving.  I would recommend on an Odyssey to replace these and the front strut units every 80k miles.  The Odyssey is very abusive on front end components and tires.
B00KTJ7IGQ|5|A+++++ exceeded my expectations
B002U6ELS4|5|Nice quality.  Metal as thick as the factory GM one and was stamped well, no ripples, bolt holes true.  Didn't really like that the inside of the pan was painted (ok- powder coated, but powder coating is paint, people), but I guess it'll be ok.  Drain plug and gasket don't leak for me.
B00ARZZ0DU|5|Awesome!
B00IS930BQ|3|Happy with the whole transaction. The bumper didn't fit right. Had to do some major realignment of the mounting holes. They didn't line up right. Not your fault.
B00I6MOKNC|5|Nice product,  fast shipping,  exact fit.
B00466V9AY|5|Excellent value, setup was a breeze. Very happy to have a replacement key fob at such a low price!
B00F9IZ6ES|5|very good
B009Q0YPA6|5|Arrived in one piece.Part was exactly what i needed.Went on without a hitch.Great job. Keep up the good work.
B00NRDRF78|1|They are not dark at all.. they are more of a clear piece of vinyl
B0002BC0PA|5|Works great.
B002WRRNFO|5|Great for college kids heading to the dorm. I've bought two of these for them to keep their valuable personal papers, etc. Work just fine.
B000HUQACU|5|This is an all metal gasket no plastic, uses higher toque setting so I'm  hoping I'll never going to have to replace this again. I have used all the others that are plastic they fail at around 50000 miles
B00FZQ1A76|5|this fixed my sprayiers,wasnt cheap,cheaper then taking it to be fixed!
B00THMNYAU|5|Great
B0057VWU1E|5|Works like a charm on my shiny black SUV.  Highly recommended
B0009IQZEI|5|It's an oil Filter. It works.  I like the grip to take off the old one, makes it easier.
B007V2ECJA|5|This sunshade fits my 2013 FJ perfectly and effectively blocks the sun. The only thing I wish it had is a strap with Velcro to wrap around it while it's not in use.
B00ZLPABGC|4|Mirrors have a low profile and look good with the aluminum housing.
B00X6WBWGK|1|The keys were not the same depth as the original. I had two different places try too duplicate the key, both were unsuccessful. End result is the keys did not work. I didn't try to contact the vendor.
B00CQ8EBAO|5|Fits like a glove
B000143LHY|5|This is a great product to cover up smoke and leaves your car smelling clean without any odors. I've also used this in a room and there's no odor left behind! This spray is awesome and would recommend! If you need to cover up any odor. I would def get this.
B0002JMIEK|5|Fantastic Stuff My Honda SI looks Great
B005XRQ9W8|5|Almost as good as OEM Honda headlights. I love the look of the black bezel in the headlights. Extremely good quality.
B006NZTZLQ|4|This device works as advertised. I had no problems with the download or uplink. Just remember to read the instructions carefully.<br />I gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons, first is the fact that instructions are very limited, and second is after I  installed the software I upgraded<br />to windows 10 and found it is not compatible. Through  registration with the software site, I have learned that they are aware of this<br />problem and are addressing it. I will be without my scan tool until then.<br />PC based software directed me to a web site to help me correct a problem that the service tech could not, It was very encouraging<br />know that it sometimes links to sources that can offer repair information rather than just reading a code and clearing it. That extra<br />information can be a life saver. Also being able to download more advanced software is an added to having a pc based program.<br />I highly recommend this, just remember it does not work with windows 10 yet.
B00OI101D8|5|These are wonderful!! I couldn't find nail brushes with the small side to get underneath your fingernails. These are strong, and you have to be careful not to put too much pressure or you could hurt the area under the fingernail because these are very strong. This is a great deal, I hope they continue to sell them. I shared some of these with other family members because we do a lot of vegetable gardening so we need them quite often.
B00IGG071M|5|Just as described. Keeps my new car clean
B00K8VQNE8|2|Cute, but smells like vomit. Luckily, the smell only lasts less than a week.
B00075XCCG|5|I purchased this for my Honda Pilot.  What sold me were the reviews saying how this is a perfect match for the Pilot.  Once installed, it looks like my Pilot came with the hitch.<br /><br />The hitch is well made, all the welds look excellent.  The hitch lines up perfectly with the threads on the Pilot.  Installation was a breeze, except for one incident.<br /><br />Like many others, I had a real hard time with the rusty threads on the right side and bumper.  I tried a pipe cleaner with liquid wrench.  No luck.  Pipe cleaner with WD 40 rust remover...worse!  Spent $80 on a tap and die set.  Could barely get the tap going.  Finally I found others who had the same problem and recommended a thread chaser set.  I purchased this set:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AEX8DW?ref_=cm_rdp_product  and it really saved the day!  All but one thread was able to be saved.<br /><br />At first, I was a little worried about not using the one thread, but decided it was negligible since I had all the other bolts torqued to spec.  If you do not have a pipe to put on the end of your torque wrench, you are going to have problems getting it to spec.<br /><br />If this seems like too much for you, Amazon offers a service for around $100 to have it installed.<br /><br />Although the rusted threads were not the fault of this receiver, it is definitely a factor in deciding on installing this yourself.  I would definitely buy and recommend this product to anyone in need of a receiver.
B001447TLO|4|Eh, its okay.  I add to my boat wash and it seems to do a good job at breaking down bird droppings, etc.  It is hard to find really good marine products, and this does work, and a little bit goes a long way.  My only disappointment is it DID NOT remove my black streaks.
B000S2P74E|2|Missing flange or ring to complete install
B00HU6N3LK|3|Not that great. Sticky and really didn't seem to clean that great.
B00EA0ZB7I|3|It's ok
B002807SF0|1|These say the work on a 08 Tundra they do not i now have to to get a new wheel to replace the one that these bored out cause they do not fit a 08 tundra the do not use the acorn hat they use a different if i could get my money back i would
B00V9HPH9C|5|Easy plug and play replacement, just be sure to have some outdoor rated double sided tape to mount the drivers somewhere near the lights. Lights are VERY bright -- adds to safety in an otherwise dimly lit 2000 Mustang.
B000ICNR78|3|I needed something to carry school mail back and forth that was durable.  This briefcase is cheap, the interior is cheap, if you make heavy use of the pockets, they will probably break.  However, if you are like me and need a box with a handle that you can carry a bunch of papers and folders in so they do not get damaged, this product will fill the bill nicely.  Its aluminum, and even I've only managed to dent it in a few places.  The clasps have functioned well.  I do not used the combination locks, but I did set them, which was not hard.  The handle is good quality.<br /><br />If you need to impress your boss with a briefcase, please look elsewhere.  If you need to carry a calculator, tablet and a bunch of pens around, you may want to look elsewhere.  If you need an inexpensive aluminum box, your in luck!  This is indeed an inexpensive aluminum box.
B00GBQYZFI|5|product ,price , perfect match . fit & worked as advertised. perfectly . would & will recommend amazon products to everyone. great job.
B009OHH4FO|5|Different level of quality than cheap import junk at HF.<br /><br />MADE here in the USA.<br /><br />I love this brand. Great build.
B004W6ET50|5|Great - exactly as ordered and prompt delivery - there was no photo but the SKU was correct and fitted as OEM.
B000C7XVY8|5|I was very happy with the part thanks
B007Y5G13O|4|Perfect fit for the 2012 Volvo S60 windshield. The only knock is the shade can be a little cumbersome to handle for those with smaller hands. My wife drives the car, and she mentions the shade being a little tough to roll or un-roll when pulling it out.
B00AZ4S49K|4|These wind visors are OK. They will do the job and they look OK on my truck. The fitment is just a little off. They don't seat well by the mirrors, how long they will last... We will see. I have purchased these for every vehicle I have owned (not these exact ones)  and these are quite different from the others. I'm not too sure I like how they stick to the paint but its too late now. Most I have had before were in-channel or stick to the rubber that goes around the window. I gave 4 stars because I thought 3 would be a little unfair because they are what I purchased.
B000C11PYW|5|Worked great . Sealed both tractor tires perfectly
B000JFJLP6|5|Works great.
B00E1SL70E|5|Great
B00XPTJBJO|5|Great buy.
B00B2IEXYI|5|Haven't received the tank from Amazon as of yet, any day now but I like what I've seen and read along with the 3 year warrantee. However, after reading all 14 reviews I think I'll be filling my tank with pure water from the garden hose and check for leaks prior to it's first use at a state campground. That should make things a whole lot easier if it develops a leak. Plus, it will give me a chance to play around with it and get an idea on how to use it with the clean water BEFORE I'm dealing with camper waste.<br />  I will write another review after I've received it had a chance to use it at a camp site. should be sometime in early Oct. of 2015.
B0000AY2Z6|5|Love it
B000CGV7UY|5|Fits well into w211 &#62;2006y with Sport package!
B001F22FDC|1|I received them today. I opened the shipping box and the product box was already opened.... They have rust on them in several places... They also look used !!!!!
B002H3B5IE|5|Worked as expected on 1999 ek3 civic<br />Honda power
B000E9QF06|5|Had a coffee spot for two months on my middle truck (cloth) seat. A light spray with this magic and a little rubbing with a clean white cloth transferred the coffee from seat to rag! No sign of a spot now and no stain left by the product. I like this one a lot!
B003CSH7RG|5|Got both front and rear guards. Great fit, easy install.
B00P8AM7K8|5|Cool looking , and slight pickup in reception. Very easy to install.
B005F38PTK|5|Works great in our camper. Was easy to install. Our previous DVD player died. Highly recommend as replacement.
B003UM9GDM|2|I have a 2015 Kawasaki Vulcan Voyager 1700 ABS and this jack is a little short as far as the base of it. The 2 arms that lift the bike are not long enough to reach all the way across from left to right. It picks it up fine, but not as stable as I would like it to be. The 2 swivel wheels do NOT swivel when the bike is up on the jack. The 2 reasons I got this jack was because it said it was for a bike like mine and the swivel wheels would make it much easier to turn the bike around in my garage, and either 1 of the 2 reasons I got it works.
B00TPVI2TQ|1|What a disapointment after all the reviews I have read on Evans waterless coolant. Even Jay Leno has recommeded this coolant.<br />I have a 64 Ford Ranchero with a 289 and C4 trans. I have tried every trick in the book and this engine, which is mechanically sound, still runs very hot on any day over 100 deg. And here in this part of Arizona 110-115 deg days are the norm. With standard coolant my engine didn't start to have heating problems until air temp of 100 deg. However with Evans my engine temp started to to rise on an 80 deg day and continue to climb to 225 and higher. The only benefit with Evans was no pressure in the cooling system so a blown hose wasn't a worry. With Evans engine operating temps will be higher, but nowhere could I find any data as to how much higher. Then I found an article that stated the head temps can be +190 deg over normal using the Evans, which leads to over heating. So I have switched back to water with a wetting/anti-corrosion additive and my engine is operating in the 190 to 210 range, which I can live with. A friend also switched to Evans, but is back to a 50/50 coolant mix, because his engine started running hot. So I do not recommend using Evans at all.
B000J19XSA|4|Good
B00092893O|5|recommended by BMW.  Have always used it.  Never had a dirty fuel injector on 5 different BMWs over 29 years
B00JFPK58S|4|breaks after a few months.
B00XVZYTLM|5|You cannot find the that easy and cheap at any retail Depot or RV Store Just the right luminous  and cooler will not melt Lenses.better light out side to, not bright.
B008EXHNZA|5|Works perfectly.
B000CIV4LY|5|GREAT PRICE VERY FAST SHIPPING FIT PREFECT
B00CDAFT6K|5|These are awesome and the only shades that actually stick to the windows of our car. They never fall off!
B0094E00NA|5|It fits. I had to enlarge the holes to make it fit but that was only minor.<br />Nice look, finished really well.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Honestly, I was quite skeptical at first.  I thought &#34;Solar light, could it really put out the light I need to illuminate the area I need.&#34;  I can say, without a doubt, yes it does.  I have an area on the side of my house where we keep our trash cans, and my son who moves them to the front would always have to bring a flash light with him.  After getting this light installed and charged, flashlight needed no more.  It even helps when I'm outside grilling after dark during the summer.  80 LED is very bright and if you are on the fence about buying it, trust me, this is the light you want to buy.
B001FJTAGK|2|Came with way more rust than a packaged new shock should.
B001BNCM8I|5|Look great in my car. Now I need to get the back ones.
B00M4K4KWI|4|fits great, but heavy! sags a little  after getting hot , hopefully will do the job to protect interior
B00LND67PA|5|It's a no brainer. Between never buying a filter again and improved MPG, K&N's eventually pay for themselves.
B000CPI6VI|5|I lost the original I had and this is the replacement. Works great.
B00BU99X2G|1|I had a very hard time installing this on my Chevy Volt and I am no stranger to working on cars. I wish I had never bought it.
B009Q0XN8G|5|fits perfect
B00JGJGCWQ|4|nice cable but overpriced.
B001F0IE7A|4|Hinge works well,  but it was one heck of a task to install.  Drilling all the holes was a real pain. Would have been much easier to weld.
B000VKTUE6|4|this is cheap replacement for my 2003 civic car.
B006GJYKWI|5|This is the very best for cleaning vinyl..gets out the most ground in dirt!
B0043WQ43I|5|worked
B00393ND6S|5|In my daytime running lights now and look great.
B0068ERNNE|1|So it is really cheap and will met if close to the engine or exhaust. It will keep out rain and the jacket is great. the pants just melt easy.
B0062IJYUG|5|Fits perfectly on my 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 5.9L Diesel, matches with my black out scheme and no problems with anything coming off due to car washing or normal wear. Still looks amazing and have almost had it for a year now!<br /><br />You just apply the 3M tape that comes with the package and stick it on the old door and its that simple!
B00R6RPXHU|5|The glue for my original/stock  mirror came off and the mirror flew off on the highway. ..and the dealer wanted like  $80 to replace it. This replacement mirror was so easy to install for  $20! It didn't come with instructions.  I just cleaned the surfaces with alcohol.  Attached the sicker to the mirror,  stuck it to the bracket.  Took less than 5 min. Great quality!
B00MKWC83S|5|These lights are cool.very easy install high quality product with true plug /play no wiring,splicing etc
B0002SA5GY|5|I've tried other brands and they don't compare to Bestop.  Spend the extra money so you wont be disappointed. This is my second set I've replace on my 25 year old jeep.
B00GRZ69R0|5|flys off hood at 55+ MPH do not buy
B005U30IJ0|5|Nice accent for my 2011 Chevy Silvarado
B0002JM69W|1|Not worth the money. Fell apart within 3 weeks.
B00393NDHW|2|does not seem as brite as they claim to be
B003CX94FE|4|Perfect fit and quick delivery
B007OW6LSC|5|Genuine toyota product and it does its job correctly.
B00BGAS2Y4|5|works good built good
B00C8EA4GG|3|I'm updating my ratings ...  as this actuator has failed as of April 2017.  It is no better than the originals unfortunately.  Original comment with 5 stars:  ***** Perfect replacement. I hope it's better than the defective parts Toyota used as original equipment!
B004BSNNY2|5|This is a great product if the only thing wrong with your A/C is lack Freon.  I had to go on YouTube to figure out how to locate the low pressure line on my A/C, but once I located the line, everything was as per the directions on the can.  My A/C works just fine, with lots of cool air, and the whole thing took just twenty minutes.  There are instructions on YouTube that provide better step-by-step guidance than what is on the can itself.
B004ZF39T0|2|The first one I received failed and the company sent another. Even though this kit is wired correctly, sometimes they turn on sometimes not. The price is OK but I'd recommend another brand due to reliability issues. I'm now searching for a different brand.  Update 12/7/15 - I must commend Kensun's customer service, they have been great but I am now on my second entirely new kit and I continue to experience the same issue. My car is a 2008 Toyota Corolla S with the automatic DRLs. The DRLs operate at a lower, dimmer voltage than when the headlights are turned on. Due to this reason, a relay harness is required. Without it, the headlights flicker and most times won't turn on. Even with the harness installed I still had frequent occurrences where the headlights would not turn on - sometimes one or the other, sometimes both! Because I need reliable headlights, I removed the HID lit and went with the standard Sylvania halogen bulbs. Based on the other reviews I read, it seems that my case is an exception.
B003554TB8|2|The bag itself seems durable enough but the straps broke as we were packing to leave, which is a problem because the bag was only half full. We had to tie the straps together to secure the bag and hope for the best since we had to leave that day.
B004GCCKUQ|5|This part for my Pontiac vibe fit perfectly. It was ordered &#34;Prime&#34; and arrived as usual, on time.
B00Y1HT0RW|5|Worked perfect for my 07 Escalade. Easy to program.
B000CGD1IA|5|Arrived as expected. I ordered the upper and lower hose with both fitting my car like the original.
B007W5DQRK|5|Awesome! 😃
B000IYZGNY|5|Item as described, Works Great. Thank You
B0116NZJ1O|1|Item didn't fit correctly
B002QGVW3K|5|Replacement for air mattress pump. Wouldn't you know it? The air mattress valve ripped, rendering the air mattress unusable, the day I replaced the battery in the pump. It was a Coleman air mattress that was a eight months out of warranty. The did give us a discount on a replacement but based on the way the valve just tore, I was hoping they would back up their warranty with a full replacement.
B00IEKNUL4|4|Once you install these, make REALLY sure you grease the pins from the caliper. If not, your new rotors WILL overheat. Also, 11.8&#34; does not fit 05 Honda Accord LX without a caliper upgrade. Only the 11.1&#34; fits right on. But, hella stopping power.
B004P1YLQE|3|Works good but not as low profile as many others out there.
B002CCF9QO|3|Had to modify holes to adapt to winch.
B008S9CJTU|5|Fast shipping, very happy with my first helmet. It's durable, well made, has air vents on top and very sleek looking.
B00AQJYF2E|5|Worked great on my 08' 3500. Had to cut first at a key shop and then Programm at my local dodge dealer. Worked great. Great price over what a dealership wanted. Had 2 keys done for less than half of the cost from a dealer.
B007IQ539C|5|Product works great.  It gets every bit out of the tubes and allows you to control how much you want out
B00L883AIC|5|Worked fine. My old buttons wore off.  This worked out great. For $$$ I have new remote
B00VZH418O|3|Based on initial use can see how it can be a useful tool to augment others methods.<br />Quality is well, the large tab broke during 1st use.
B00JRE38EA|4|Been using these for a few months now and they have held up well...but I only give four stars because  on one bulb one of the led's has begun to flicker
B000M5Y720|5|cheap, good, and prompt delivery. Does the job.<br />not too flashy, not too dull.<br />easy to install.
B001PNCNG0|5|Work as advertised. Most of the time spent on the vehicle (2004 Chrysler Town&Country) was to get the old part out of the way. The new one fit perfectly. My V6 T&C needed two of these and once they were installed it took care of the CEL (check engine light).
B0085FOFXU|2|They look good but I've had them on for 3 days and they are already fogging up, the blinker lights don't fit proporly. It came 2 days after it said it was coming. Over all fairly disappointed.
B007KD1N9W|5|love it
B00E7WEFQ2|5|Love these. They are made well. The 3m tape sticks well. Now you can look at her and know that she's a lady.
B0062IJOJ2|5|AT 220lbs and 6'2&#34;, I was skeptical of this being strong enough. After 6 weeks still solid.
B0035DEJQ0|4|Package came as expected
B00BD4YPEY|4|Design of the covers did not fit the front seats but they fit on the second row seats.
B001MODCJO|3|2010 F150...Not at all what they look like in the picture, doesn't fit 50&#34;, fits 52&#34;. Mounting hardware doesn't look strong but does hold tight. Drill slow, start small, and work your way up in bit size.
B004H78NQ0|5|Fit good
B009T4OC3Y|5|worked perectly on my 2008 Tahoe
B00KVWEFNA|5|Perfect fit. Great price fast shipping. Even came with new bulbs
B00LI5QGC2|5|What a great cover.  It's so comfortable but had to have my car agency hook it up underneath the seat.  I'm 70 and really don't bend very well anymore.
B00PB4GPL8|5|Super fast ship, would buy again, very pleased!
B000V2W0GE|5|Fit perfectly, awesome delivery!
B002GQEZH0|1|This item is practically useless.  The lever is too short for adequate leverage and the mechanism is so tightly assembled that it makes it virtually unusable.
B009613RT0|1|Didnt fit proprly
B0068MZJT6|5|Good Product at a good price
B00EPDLB74|5|Good
B0081N1OS0|1|not much blue blocking. they didn't last 2 weeks. they scratch very easily. the frame was ok.  frames are small. better suited for a female user
B008AN47IK|4|Very pleased with order got in 2 days
B000I04Z7Q|5|Did everything I expected and install was easy. Perfect brightness.
B000SANNTW|5|Fine
B000ALG8LO|5|Tremendous value, price and size. Considering a 1oz size costs about half the price, I'd recommend to anyone.
B00KVPO21C|4|Works fine for rising my black car.  No water spots when rinsed thoroughly.
B001CEG90I|5|Perfect fit
B00J6VF1RG|4|they look cool - strange shipment - comes directly from China in a non marked package …
B00JIIZCM6|5|This product did a very nice job cleaning my leather furniture. Would highly recommend it!
B000OL3K48|4|Neons worked great. Screws could have been a little better. Buy overall good value
B003VZLJFG|5|I'm very impressed with this product, I would suggest going to a YouTube instructional video rather than just reading the directions. They give a few more helpful tips.
B0044FQSY4|5|Purchased 2 of these. I replaced one but it didn't correct the problem,or so I thought...well the Chevy impala has 3 of these acuators..Once I replaced the other one it were perfect. So I replaced 2 and so far so good.
B00404WDUC|5|Great tire pressure gauge!  Dial also glows for a little while in the dark.  I checked the pressure against other gauges and it seems to be very accurate.
B000CHKIVW|4|I fit correctly on my car.
B00CXAPT6A|2|when the sun light hits, your eyes will be screwed. Make sure to get at least 35% window tint before attempting to buy this product. Also, easily scratched so keep it clean
B008G2236S|2|EXTREMELY dissatisfied with this product. They did fit perfectly and looked great, but after the first wash with them installed, only 3 days after installation mind you, they have already let moisture in and fogged on both sides. I also purchased the matching Eagle Eye headlights and they too are beginning to fog up. Stay away from the Eagle Eye brand, they are obviously not reliable in this use.
B007FKUDXC|5|Love it
B007WISFC8|5|Perfect for my Veloster Turbo
B00EEG8BV6|5|Worked as expected on 1999 ek3 civic<br />Honda power
B0009JKGII|2|Did not work on removing sap from my trucks exterior.
B000EDSSMA|5|It fits very well.  My husband was able to attach it so it remains in place. It definately gives us more prep space.
B0068FV6YU|5|Cheaper than OEM and is cleanable
B0093CFTIO|5|Worked
B00J5DW9XY|5|Great product, was on back order from the dealer. Got a much better price too !
B008L4SXI8|5|Replaced it with my broken blue latch.. Now my tailgates got bling bling.. Every scion XB owner will know the reason why because there's only two option primer black or chrome! Unless you care to pay full dealership price! LOL. Great replacement.
B00IKYPLW0|5|Good match!
B001UFRUWU|5|It worked great !!!!!!!! It worked great !!!!!!!! It worked great !!!!!!!! It worked great !!!!!!!!
B0083YDM00|5|Front grill was perfect.  Only needed a screw driver to replace part.  Took less than 10 minutes to replace. A very satisfied customer.
B0075PXKBO|5|AAA
B007NPLW4S|5|can go shopping now without worrying about what's in the back
B006B7YUCA|5|Excellent product and great quality. Excellent part for your car. Gave bit of power and aggressive with a HKS Hi Power Exhaust
B009AA8IHI|5|Good simple easy to use
B00FFU70SU|2|These do not fit 2013 Turbo as stated,  I had to modify the lower one on each side to fit flush,  Did that because it was not worth mailing back
B00LOS9DZA|5|went on easy and fixed the problem. The price was also good.
B00LKF69O0|5|works like a champ
B00272GPTO|5|It worked just like it was suppose to work.  Good product.
B005QE7EPY|5|Fits perfectly.  Much nicer to use than universal models.
B00BOEN6DY|1|Very flimsy and cheap for factory  Quality
B000CPAFJO|5|Good quality
B00HUG0JB2|5|They work great like all other Weather Tech products.
B00DQQ8PWK|5|custom fit, great looking
B005SZKGVU|5|Great spray bottle head!! I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this. So many hardly work, or don't work at all.  I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised when I put it to use. If you're like me,  we have spray bottles long after the spray heads have ceased to work. Why purchase an entire spray bottle, when you only need the spray head? I love the foaming action in the bathroom and kitchen.
B0093RRSXS|5|Clipped right in on my '02 Nissan Altima, not too much more to say, all is well.
B004IM28GA|5|Worked great so far no issues
B000GV6G7Y|5|Perfect spring just what I needed to get proper sag
B003721C0U|5|Made installation of my Curt Brake Controller too easy. Clean install as well!
B009SIO9Q6|5|worked great
B00S1G5AJG|3|I got an older model that was complete garbage. The customer service was EXCELLENT. The quickly refunded my items and sent me their new and improved product. The new product didn't far well either though.The bolt popped into the gasket it was meant to expand, letting the flag fall off machine. I did fix it in a way. I removed the gasket, replaced it with a washer and just clamped it down that way.
B003WDDLTO|5|as expectedc
B0009JB7GI|5|My old car only had the cigarette lighter outlet. This allows me to charge my cell and a flashlight.
B005DUUK2U|1|Cheap thin plastic bag. Zipper broke first time I tried to use it. Dont waste your money. Much better avalible.
B000L7QZ0Q|5|Works well. Does the job. I used this kit to flare my brake lines. I used Cu-Ni lines (Soft) so the flares were super easy. Die block is serrated for grip. Made in China but is of decent quality.
B0002NIKGQ|5|Would buy again with no hesitation. Came quickly and fits my truck exactly as expected, very durable.
B00HVI7426|5|Easy
B00HNHW61O|5|Excelent, it fits just perfect on my car
B002MQAWOY|5|Excellent
B008CH9JAA|5|Works perfectly.
B013LHUPRG|4|Appears to be a very good part for the price.  I bought it for a Honda XR/CRF 100 in the hopes that it would fit.  The measurements were very close and I thought that for the price, I'd give a shot.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fit without some mods to the bike.  I'm currently in the process of cutting off the captured nuts on the bike and will try it then.  Once that's all done and I have the opportunity to install this, I'll be able to add some info on the longevity of the part.<br /><br />To make sure we're all on the same page, this part was not advertised for the XR/CRF100.  I bought it in the hopes that I could make it fit.  Additionally, the fitment issues are with the bike, not this item.
B00DMOSGH0|5|Perfect fit and cheaper than I could get here
B000C7XVOI|5|Exactly what I needed excellent transaction
B00KMM6A6Y|5|Seriously the coolest thing I've ever put on any motorcycle. Serious head turner.
B006FRONT6|1|Piece of crap. Didn't fit.
B00JIEX722|1|Bought these 2 weeks ago for my '12 G37. They looked good when 1st installed & the brighteness was just right to my liking. However, only 1 bulb works now while the other has burned out. Will be returning these and looking for another brand...
B007929NAK|4|Did find cheaper deal after I had ordered, worked great though.
B001FCB4JS|5|great
B008G1WI4G|4|Installed and working well.
B001NAUAQU|5|Showed up fast works great
B00UXO1OTO|5|Easy to program!! Great buying experience!
B00EG84RFQ|2|Wasn't as big as I wanted
B0015U6VLQ|2|Not what it said it was
B00X9R5DTO|2|Easy to install with a few separately purchased items. All good except it sounds like a clown horn. My stock horn was louder too.
B00HJG0QUC|5|Never used one before this. The price was right. These things are miraculous. You don't know what's on your car until you run one of these over it!
B000IYT16M|5|They work Great.!
B00GUA7CBY|5|These just get brittle after being in the sun.  This nozzle was OEM and fit perfectly.
B00PJPHEBO|1|-5 Stars!!!!<br />I just got it in the mail today and it doesn't work at all!!! I plugged it in my car, started it up and i turned on my bluetooth and it couldn't find it... I tried it with my phone Alcatel Fierce 2 and my Nexus 7 neither one of them could find it on Bluetooth. I was so excited to get it in the mail and very disappointed that it didn't work.
B00EHA5C8O|4|The lid works great for protecting the fire pit when not in use and the handle is very useful for carrying it from place to place.  The handle is just made of straps with metal hooks at the end, so it can't stay on all the time, it can only be used when you actually want to move the firepit.
B00JX70NOY|5|Hooked right up

B000MDZLR2|4|Fits perfectly and looks great
B00RGNCV1U|5|WHY did I not think of this? It works
B003R8D60I|4|The fit is pretty good.  Also, helps catch anything from rolling out of your 4Runner when you open up the liftgate.<br /><br />However the thing I don't like about this is that the edges just won't unravel properly.  It just looks crushed and folded still.
B00AWYC32M|4|Matched car but faded after 6 months
