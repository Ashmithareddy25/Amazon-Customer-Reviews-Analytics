0143038419|1.0|I want my money back. I stayed up late reading this book so I could finish it as quickly as possible. This book is about Elizabeth Gilbert, an average American woman in her mid-thirties, who \\"claims\\" to have suffered a devastating divorce and cannot stop talking about herself. Reading this book makes you envy your shrink, who at least gets paid to hear people yap about themselves.     First of all, I couldn't believe how touristy and shallow her experiences were, considering how long she had stayed in each location. She claims to be an open-minded person, who can befriend anybody, even the dead. However, she fails to make genuine connections with locals, opting instead to hang out with expats and the few locals who cater to foreigners. My hopes went up everytime she met someone interesting, but Gilbert stubbornly keeps the attention on herself or her problems, making the book as dull as watching paint dry.     She did slightly better in the Indonesia section (though you have to get through Italy and India before that), where she finally allows some interesting locals to share the spotlight. However, the colorful stories these personalities bring to the book are always cut short by Gilbert's ramblings about her new Brazilian boyfriend. Reading pages upon pages of this woman's trivial thoughts and feelings was pure agony!

Don't think you'll get step-by-step answers on \\"what to do next\\". But, if you are really interested in understanding yourself, and putting some effort forth to make changes for the better, then these are the books for you. I say books, because I read both the original \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" and \\"Strengths Finder 2.0\\". I'm glad I did - \\"Now, Discover..\\" provides more information on the subject.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Very loosely based on Mark Millar and JG Jones' gritty comic book mini-series, WANTED tells of Wesley Gibson's transformation from pathetic cubicle rat to astounding super-assassin. Angelina Jolie (looking predictably sexylicious) plays the mysterious Fox, who helps recruit Wesley into the Fraternity, a one-thousand-year-old, very select brotherhood of assassins.<br /><br />It seems that Wesley, prone to crippling anxiety attacks, is the son of a master assassin and that he has inherited his father's supernormal aptitude for killing. Wesley's attacks aren't really caused by anxiety. Rather, those are the moments when his senses go into overdrive, when his heart pulsates to an excess of four hundred beats per minute and his perception and reflexes are boosted to extraordinary levels. In such a state, Wesley can accomplish wondrous things, not the least of which is shooting the wings off a fly. This, he demonstrates (very much to his surprise) at the behest of Sloan, the Fraternity leader.<br /><br />Gone over to the dark side (but he prefers to think of it as freeing himself from the shackles of mediocrity), Wesley quickly enough signs on with the Fraternity (where each member shares his talents). A key incentive is that the secretive group numbered his father as a member. And learning that his father was murdered by a rogue Fraternity agent, Wesley is determined to avenge him. But, first things first. Wesley is subjected to a brutal training regimen; then he has to prove himself. So he's assigned a target. And then another...<br /><br />WANTED may have ended up veering off the original source by a ways, but it does stay true in one sense: this film is just about the opposite of a superhero flick. Going against the superhero grain was a goal which Mark Millar and JG Jones successfully pulled off in their comic book series. This movie is nasty and pessimistic and dark, and plenty of things are unbelievable about it. But so what? It's also damn entertaining, right from the adrenalin-pumping opening sequence. The protagonists (Wesley and Fox) aren't really \\"good guys.\\" The Fraternity to which they belong does come up with a reason-to-be for its existence (some mumbo-jumbo about these folks being \\"necessity's assassins,\\" eliminating targets presented by Fate to balance the world). It's a fairly nebulous reason, and the Loom of Fate does come off as a silly contrivance (\\"Do you make sweaters or do you kill people?\\").<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to call the violence visceral, but there are some pretty brutal scenes here, as when Wesley is being \\"instructed\\" by the Butcher and the Repairman. I would call the action sequences breathtaking and spectacular and stylized. And is there anything cooler than a curving bullet?<br /><br />The cast is top-notch. Angelina Jolie is an actress who can really act, but who truly shines in these action roles. She just brings that attitude and charisma. As Fox, Jolie is mean and vicious and glorious. The girl simply does her thing with style. And, oh, that wicked smile. James McAvoy displays a flawless American accent and is pretty good. I've always thought there's a realness to this guy, from the moment I saw him in a supporting role in WIMBLEDON, and this grounding quality of his comes in handy when portraying Wesley's remarkable transformation. Then there's Morgan Freeman, lending calm gravitas to the screen even as he embarks into a more sinister realm with his character Sloan. I don't think I've ever heard Morgan Freeman cussing before.<br /><br />I did like the first half slightly better than the second. It fascinated me, watching Wesley develop from a bullied weakling to a confident smiter of dudes. I guess I got off on the little revenge moments, as when he gets his back from his cheating girlfriend and his erstwhile best friend. Wesley's rant against his fat supervisor, though, may have been too mean.<br /><br />So the cool premise gets to you. The very implausible story draws you in. But WANTED, above all else, is a wicked visual treat, an ideal, over-the-top summer flick. Me, I soaked in the attitude, marveled at the sheer audacity of it all. And, damn, if I'm not in love with Angelina Jolie, all over again. I wouldn't say no to a sequel.ut WANTED, above all else, is a wicked visual treat, an ideal, over-the-top summer flick.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have several of these Sony earphones.  I use them with my iPod Shuffle because I don't like the iPod ear buds very much.  I also use the earphones with my Walkman.  They are light and comfortable and the sound quality is surprisingly good.  Since I wear the earphones while jogging, their lifespan on hot summer days is limited--usually about 90 days in the summer, longer in cooler weather--but the price is so reasonable, I figure the headphones are still a good value.
B00168OINK|5.0|I took my 7 year old daughter to the theater to see this movie and we both loved it. She left the theater kung-fu kicking her way out...really! I generally haven't cared for Jack Black or his movies, but he voiced Po the panda pretty well, I must say. Dustin Hoffman was excellent as the voice of Shifu. My only question was why were Jackie Chan and Lucy Liu even in this movie since their characters were completely overlooked? Each had only a handful of lines, if that. Kind of like having Steve Irwin's voice in Happy Feet, blink and you'll miss them. Angelina Jolie's tigress did most of the talking for the 5 warriors. Overall the movie was entertaining, fast-paced and lots of fun. It even delivers a great message for kids and adults too for that matter...you really CAN aspire to be whatever it is you WANT to be. If you want it bad enough, the power is within you. I will be purchasing this movie in blu-ray for sure. Have some fun with your kids and go see it!
B000PC0S5K|1.0|I never ceased to be saddened by how many people are taken in by self-help authors who rake in millions of dollars telling people all they have to do is \\"unleash the inner you\\" and \\"command the power of Now\\" and \\"Just Do It!\\" and \\"you deserve a break today\\" [OK, that last one slipped :)]. So many people are really hurting, questioning, seeking a purpose for their lives. Increasingly, especially in America, we either have too little, or more often perhaps, too much as we chase \\"IT\\" [houses, cars, boats, spouses], thinking that when we get \\"IT\\" we'll be happy. The inevitable result: you finally get \\"IT\\" and after a while, the newness fades and you're chasing something else.<br /><br />Contentment in life is not about getting rich (the American dream), having toys, or the perfect body. Fulfillment in life is found in a relationship with God, through Jesus Christ. God created you and you can't find your purpose in life apart from Him. If you want real wisdom, read the book of Proverbs in the Bible, not this pseudo-Zen nonsense. I pray you will find Truth.

1594489505|5.0|Afghanistan under the Taliban, says Eve Ensler in The Vagina Monologues, is a place where hating women is fully codified. Under the Taliban, women could not leave the house without a man, and even then they had to be covered from head to toe in a burqa; women couldn't work; they couldn't get medical treatment--the Taliban took over all the hospitals for the exclusive care of men. If a woman ran away from a brutal husband she was brought back home for his punishment. Any defiance brought beatings and sometimes death. These things, and more, happen to Mariam and Laila, the two main characters in A Thousand Splendid Suns.<br /><br />The story begins during the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, and follows the rebel Mujahadeen movement that overthrew the communists. Welcomed at first as heroes by the people, the rebels quickly splintered into fighting factions (using weapons supplied by the U.S. for fighting the Russians), and the brutal Taliban emerged victorious. Within two weeks after occupying Kabul, the country's capital, they instituted Shari'a, a system of Muslim law under which women are treated worse than cattle.<br /><br />It is in Kabul that the lives of Laila and Mariam, two very different women with very different histories, intersect.  Theirs is the story behind the history, the truth behind the above mentioned facts, the daily lives behind the daily headlines. This is the part of history they don't teach in school: the details of exactly how wars and movements affect real people. Knowing their stories makes the reader genuinely concerned about Afghanistan, more inclined to follow news reports as we worry about women like Mariam and Laila and their children. A Thousand Splendid Suns has made me feel for the Afghan people on a level deeper than newspaper facts ever can.<br /><br />Hosseini manages to inject hope, even redemption, into this tale of brutality and misery; the problem is that, in real life, there've been reports of a Taliban resurgence. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, the Afghan Taliban is better organized today than it was in 2001, and they're recruiting new members all the time. Thus, I'm more worried than ever about the millions of Lailas and Mariams whose lives may again be imperiled. Rather than regret having gotten to know them, though, I wish everyone would read A Thousand Splendid Suns and get to know these women like I did. Maybe if we all worried a little bit more, we'd do something to change the terrible situation of women in Afghanistan.Foreign Relations, the Afghan Taliban is better organized today than it was in 2001, and they're recruiting new members all the time.

0778321606|1.0|I honestly don't remember if I read something that trite ever. From the very first pages, I had the feeling I was before a \\"packaged\\" product, whether the agent of that packaging is some \\"writer's software\\", or some other assembly-line system of writing that spits out one formula after the other.<br /><br />And, as if that were not enough, the content itself is a series of cliches strung mercilessly one after the other.<br /><br />The women in this book are mostly the \\"wait-for-your-man-and-cater-to-him\\" type, with nauseating cliches about their magic works in the kitchen, women who say things like \\"a man I could lean on\\", women who \\"make meals to please their husbands\\", women who are distraught they \\"disappointed their husbands\\" because they couldn't bear them babies.. etc..etc.<br /><br />So, the author seems to believe it is just that type of woman who would be into knitting, repeating the old (and ignorant) stereotype about knitters as a species.<br /><br />Then, the author keeps repeating writing about events she'd stated, over and over again like she'd forgotten she already mentioned them, and my question is: did she not revise even once? Where was the editor??<br /><br />As if that were not enough, she over-explains everything like she's writing to dimwits who have to have everything explained and re-explained to them in order for them to \\"get it\\"!<br /><br />As for her dialogues, I found myself constantly wondering, \\"WHO ON EARTH SPEAKS LIKE THAT???\\"<br /><br />Cliched words, cliched situations, cliched men and women, cliched stories and cliched endings... Smacks of some \\"machine-writing\\" to me... maybe a new \\"writing wiz\\" that you feed a few keywords the way you put in a search engine and it vomits a story out to you? But then again, I could be wrong, and this story could be solely the product of the author's imagination... which would be infinitely worse...<br /><br />There is but one redeeming feature in this book, however, aspiring writers could use it as a way to learn how NOT to write, its merit lies in its instructive value as a perfect specimen of dreadful writing.tructive value as a perfect specimen of dreadful writing.
B000UR366S|4.0|Joni Mitchell's latest collection sports a sticker saying \\"The Radiant Return of One of the Greatest Singer/Songwriters of Our Time.\\" Return? I hadn't noticed she'd gone away. Turbulent Indigo was released in 1994, and since then she's released a whole bunch of remakes with a new song or two thrown in on each. Not to mention Both Sides Now, in which she covered old standards like Comes Love and Stormy Weather backed by a full orchestra. At 65, I'd say Joni Mitchell's working pretty darn hard! Besides, Mitchell doesn't need these kinds of promotional gimmicks: her fans buy every jewel she quietly slips out, and we're so passionate that word-of-mouth always brings new buyers.<br /><br />Shine could be touted thematically, under that latest popular tropism, \\"Green\\": almost every song on Shine is about \\"this unfolding tragedy,\\" environmental destruction. She doesn't bang our heads against the wall, but sings about the situation with deep and gentle pathos. I hate to break Shine into pieces, though, with lyrics here and music there: as Ann Powers pointed out in the L.A. Times, the genius behind Mitchell's work is that each and every aspect--lyrics,  melody, phrasing, intonation, even cover art--is executed with enormous care and consideration for the whole. Thus it would be misguided to tear her work apart, even to quote lyrics out of context.<br /><br />With the exception of one or two, the songs on Shine are typical Joni Mitchell--although, with her eclectic explorations, there really is no such thing as a typical Joni Mitchell song. Their effect on me, however, is typical. \\"This Place\\", for instance, a melodic elegy for the planet, is hauntingly addictive: every minute I'm not listening to it I want to be. While the lyrics could break your heart, you could choreograph a beautiful ballet to the melody. (The Alberta Ballet has in fact set a ballet, The Fiddle and The Drum, to Mitchell's music. It debuted in February 2007, and a new full-length adaptation will open in February 2009.)<br /><br />My only sort-of quibble with Shine is the inclusion of yet another remake of \\"Big Yellow Taxi.\\" Though the arrangement differs slightly from the original, with an almost Cajun sound, I for one don't need another version of one of the most overplayed songs in FM radio history. Granted, the song does fit in perfectly with the theme, reminding us that Joni Mitchell was issuing environmental alerts all those years ago.<br /><br />Just one more thing: as a smoker, I have to say something about Joni Mitchell's enthusiasm for cigarettes. Some critics say she's ruined her voice with them, but I happen to like her husky smoker's voice at least as much as the bell tones of her youth. Sometimes I even prefer it: Mitchell used to do a lot of high-pitched woo-woo-ing that could break glass; the Ladies of the Canyon album is so full of woo-woo's I've been tempted on occasion to smash it.

It has some of the best CGI of any movie I have ever watched.  You will have a hard time believing the animals and birds that accompany the characters in the movie are not real.  The bonus DVD that accompanies the movie is almost as entertaining as the movie and if you are curious as to how such movies are made, maybe more interesting!

0739366416|5.0|We recently did a 4,000+ mile road trip, and this was one of the audiobooks purchased to get us through that trip.  My husband was already an Obamaite [what I've come to call those almost-fanatical supporters who believe in Senator Obama resides all hope for the future]. I am definitely less sure of Mr. Obama, wondering about his relative inexperience, and always hearing a little voice in the back of my head saying if it looks too good to be true....you know the rest.  Neither one of us had read either of Obama's books.    Mr. Obama's the voice for this audiobook, and it's a pleasant listening experience, unlike some of the other audiobooks we took with us and stopped listening to before the end of the first cd.    It does give you what seems to be a fairly honest look into Mr. Obama's life, letting you know his basic philosphy, beliefs, hopes.  Just as you begin to enter the eyes glazed over, too boring, too much grand political view, up pops a personal anecdote that's interesting.    As an audiobook, we both give it two thumbs up.  It's easy to listen to, keeps your interest throughout and, perhaps more importantly, gives some insight into the man who may be our next president.

B0014XCMVM|4.0|I've been a fan of Alanis Morissette since the Undeniably Genius work that was Jagged Little Pill. One thing that has changed for me is that I loved to sing along with each of the songs on JLP. Since then, Alanis's work has become so personal that many times I feel like a voyeur when I listen to the lyrics. I'm still trying to get used to the way she has of exposing everything she has to give in her songs. When I'm listening in my car I often feel that I'd like to be at home with the song lyrics, reading and analyzing and trying to figure out just what she was feeling when she wrote them. . This is a very nice album, and I'm finding that I get more from it with each listen.  It's a keeper!
0375507256|4.0|David Mitchell's _Cloud Atlas_ is a sprawling work, with six separate narratives, five of which are interrupted only to appear in their successors.  That is, the first half of the first story becomes a part of the first half of the second story, and so on, till they revolve around the sixth story before we hear the second halves of each of the stories in turn.  The effect of this was that the second half of my read felt like it kept ending and each set of characters got wrapped up, one set at a time.  For all the aspiration and pretension of this central structural device, its parts generally come across as very accessible.  Some will appeal more than others (I grew tired of the post-apocolyptic pidgin dialect of the sixth story pretty quickly), but which ones strike the deepest chords will vary from reader to reader.  If there is a larger theme, I would say it is each character's awakening to the casualness with which humans enslave one another (literally and figuratively) and the forms that their struggles to overcome this take.    One thing I would say about the shifting styles and the grand structure at its heart is that for all that craft and design, the whole ends up feeling like a grabbag.  I don't mean to suggest that's a bad thing.  When you read some things, from detective novels to Dante's Inferno, you're left with a sense that every event, even every word is there for some express structural purpose and that none of this will make sense without the greater whole.  Cloud Atlas doesn't quite feel that way.  These characters and their various narratives are bumping into each other in the grand scheme of things, rather than embodying some greater logic.  To its credit, each of these stories gets a character of its own and each one's relation to the others is a particular, distinct thing.  It reminded me of the feeling I get traveling, a bit out of place and wandering into other people's lives as I overhear their stories, recognize a little something and float on to the next.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Cloverfield the monster movie: The Cloverfield monster (Clover) is never really explained. It's just a big thing with no origin that trashes a major metropolitan area for no apparent reason. Granted, this is a formula that's worked before. But, since our perspective as the movie viewer is tied to a group of civilians who's only interest is in getting the people they care about to a safe distance, the entire film is spent running away from any and all action that they encounter. This makes sense from the point of view of the character, but from the viewer's point of view it means that there really isn't any plot surrounding the monster. It simply is there and it's trashing things without motivation. Even B-grand monster movies like Godzilla have SOME sort of motivation for the monster to be doing what it's doing.    So, since the monster has no motivation, no plot, and few appearances, it's existence as a character ranks just bellow the pressurized oxygen tank in Jaws. With that in mind, I can't really classify this as a monster movie.    Cloverfield the Romance: Cloverfield has three distinct romances. There's the reliable couple, the couple that slept together once but never became a couple in spite of both their feelings, and the couple that isn't ever really a couple because it's just a guy who has a crush on a girl who happens to be tagging along. The first one ends right after the attack with death and the third one ends with the girl exploding because apparently that's what happens to you when you're bitten by the little monsters that fall off the big monsters, which happens before anything happens between the two. So, we must assume that the primary romance is the second romance. Over half of the movie is spent with the male or the romance trying to find the female and saver her from the destruction. When she is eventually saved, she's injured very badly and not really coherent for the remainder of the film. Eventually, the two almost reconcile their difference and become an item, but they get blown up before they really get a chance.    So, three romances, all of which end in death. The only one that survives to the end of the film never really happens anyway. Clearly, not a romance film.    Cloverfield the Disaster Movie: Disaster movies are great. Everything comes crashing down and the world (or at least the portion we're concerned with) is leveled. And with a giant thing decapitating the Statue of Liberty, this is a very promising possibility. But, we never find out what's been destroyed, though we can assume that a big chunk of New York has been bombed at the end.    So, some portion of New York has been destroyed, we think. Not enough to go on to be a disaster movie.    Cloverfield the Movie: Every movie has a story. Stories consist of a beginning, a middle, and an end. There's a beginning, though it seems only loosely tied in to the film. And it has a middle. That's where everyone is running around for some reason. But, it doesn't really have an end, it just sort of stops. Not only that, but in all of the film, nothing really happens. The characters just run from A to B to C to D. Everything they do is eventually negated. There is no character growth, and no real change to the status quo once the monster attacks. Cloverfield has all the plot of a bowl of cereal.    So, without any sort of story line, I personally can't even qualify this as a movie.    Cloverfield the preview: Cloverfield has a lot of hints as to what the plot could be, clips showing that there's a monster doing something, and an unresolved conclusion that suggests that everything we hold dear could be threatened. But, previews are pretty carefully made. They only use the best clips and they leave you wanting more. Cloverfield is mostly shots that could have been cut and within 15 minutes of the action cutting in I just wanted it all to be over so I could do something better with my time like organizing my sock drawer.    Cloverfield even fails tobe a preview.    Cloverfield the classified military film: Cloverfield starts out with white type on a black screen telling us that this is a video found at the location that used to be Central Park. This suggests that this is a film the government has found and has analyzed in order to better understand what happened. Kind of a cool concept for a film; kind of voyeuristic. But the government, having already processed the film and put a title in, would have cut the first chunk and just used the part of the film that takes place while the monster is attacking. Not only that, but the military would probably have abandoned this film anyway as there is no tactical advantage to analyzing this film. There are no clear shots of the monster to analyze, nothing in the film shows the movement of the monster across the city, in fact there is absolute nothing in this film that says anything about what went wrong, why it went wrong, and how we can avoid it in the future. So, rather than use this film, the government would have most likely destroyed it or declassified it and given it to the press.    My conclusion is that Cloverfield is a mess. They had a monster that could have been really cool, that had plenty of time they could have built a plot, and they had roles which could have been filled by characters with depth that we cared about. But, the monster was lame, there was no plot, and I never really cared if the characters lived or died.

B000HIVQK8|4.0|I can understand your disappointment to learn that a different guitarist \\"imitated\\" George's signature slide guitar style, but I wanted to bring a few things you may not know to light:    In one interview, he stated that, prior to the Japan tour, he \\"had not picked up the guitar in awhile\\", had been mostly playing the ukelele.  He was pretty forthcoming in admitting that he had gotten \\"a bit rusty\\". He may have also been (unbeknowst to us all) somewhat ill,even at that point in time.    The Japan tour was probably mostly a financial/monetary endeavor.  He stated that Eric Clapton had talked him into it, maybe for that reason.  The choice of Japan (as opposed to the U.S., for one)might likely have had to do with the poor reception he received when touring the U.S. in the '70s;  he felt the audience at that time was expecting \\"The Beatles\\". He probably had more confidence that he would be accepted/respected on his own merits.    The reason I say \\"financial/monetary reasons\\" is because, when I trace back to the first rumors of his health problems, they surface prior to the tour.  He may have received the first hints of a grave diagnosis, even at that time, and in spite of what would turn out to be a temporary recovery. George was strengthening his family's financial future.    That, as you know, is George.

B000OQF6N6|2.0|Ok First off let's get this out of the way: The vocals are terrible. There's little to appreciate on this album, but when you do find something you like in the music, you'll undoubtedly be quickly disappointed with whatever song you were listening to once Billy's odd sounding vocals kick back in.     The strange unemotional tone of Billy Corgan's voice coupled with odd layering techniques will bother you. There's no doubt about this. They are a distraction and a nuisance through out, and this is something new for a Pumpkins album. I've always felt the emotion that Billy Corgan carried in his voice added something inherently accessible for your average listener to appreciate in every genre of music that he's attempted. But in every song on Zeitgeist his vocals are way too thin and never approach anything that might be considered \\"emotional\\" in any sense of the word.     The first single, Tarantula left me and a lot of other fans feeling very excited for this release. After listening to the album I have to say that while it's not a perfect song, I still think it's one of the most complete songs on the album and definitely one of the most satisfying.     Surprisingly, United States, the \\"epic\\" song on the album fails to deliver and might be the biggest disappointment overall. It feels like I'm listening to an unfinished version of this song every time I hear it. It seriously feels like there are missing guitar tracks on this song or something.  United States finally starts to build promise around 8:10, but then it breaks down into something that sounds way too much like Jackboot and it all just comes off as lazy in the end. Also, the \\"whoo\\" that Billy does at 6:99 in this song may be the single strangest choice on an album full of strange choices.     (Come on) Let's Go feels to me like a bastardization of Zero. (Remember Zero, kids?) Not a terrible song through and through though. It is kind of catchy, and would probably serve as a better single than That's The Way (My Love Is) too, but this song (just like every other song on this album) has its problems. The vocals actually wouldn't be so bad on this song if it weren't for the fact that they sound flat at certain times. Also, Jimmy's cymbals sound way too splashy and don't mix into the song at all. If you had told me that a song on this album would sound somewhat like a mixture of White Spider, Zero, and Transformer I would have hugged you. But, somehow we wind up with something that sounds a little too \\"pop rock\\" for my taste when this song is done.     That's another problem with this album. With every track the listener is subjected to one of two things; you either get a misguided \\"pop rock\\" sound out of these songs or you get a watered down cliche rock tune. Take your pick because that's about all you have to choose from here, and either choice comes with the added bonus of strange production choices to boot.     The album doesn't even end on a good note. The last two tunes on this album strike me as throw away songs and their delivery is just boring. For God and Country should be acoustic and Pomp and Circumstance should just never ever be played again. These two songs don't really leave you wanting more or feeling like you've had a really great experience after sitting down and listening to this album. Overall not a great note to end the album on, and not really a great album to base your band's comeback on either.    My suggestion to you is that if you're a fan of the mid 90s Smashing Pumpkins music and are looking for a more updated modern rock sound, you should buy Machina I. Then download Machina II off the internet and mix all your favorites off the two albums together. In the end you'll have a modern rock album that no other band out there today can touch; not even Smashing Pumpkins.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|\\"WALL·E\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Set in a galaxy not so very far away, WALL·E is the new Disney/Pixar comedy about one determined robot. After hundreds of lonely years doing what he was built for, WALL·E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE (Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). When EVE comes to realize that WALL·E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, she races back to space to report her findings. And while she sets off to tell the waiting humans that it's safe to return home, WALL·E chases EVE across the galaxy on his own unique adventure. The voice cast led by Ben Burtt (who also did the film editing and sound design to Episodes I-III of the Star Wars franchise (1999, 2002, & 2005), also did the sound design to Episodes IV-VI of the Star Wars franchise (1977, 1980, & 1983), and also did the sound design to the Indiana Jones movies (1981, 1984, 1989, & 2008) (as the voice of WALL·E / M - O, he also did the sound design to the film) and Elissa Knight (as the voice of Eve) is brilliant! The directing and screenplay by Andrew Stanton (who also did the screenplays and the storys to \\"Finding Nemo\\" (2003), \\"Toy Story 1 & 2\\" (1995 & 1999), \\"A Bug's Life\\" (1998) & the screenplay to \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" (2001) is brilliant! The music by Thomas Newman (who also did the music to \\"Finding Nemo\\" (2003), and Sam Mendes' films ever since \\"American Beauty\\" (1999) is beautiful and brilliant! The film editing by Stephen Schaffer (who also did the film editing to \\"The Incredibles\\" (2004) is excellent! The production design by Ralph Eggleston (who also did the production design to \\"Finding Nemo\\", was an art director on \\"Toy Story\\" & \\"The Incredibles\\", and also wrote the story to \\"Monsters, Inc.\\") is brilliant! This is a cinematic and animated masterpiece. This is also a beautiful, brilliant, and heartwarming film that will tug at your heartstrings. This is the best film of the year, if not the best animated film of the decade, so far. This is just as brilliant, if not, better than, Pixar's last film, last year's \\"Ratatouille\\" (2007). This is definitely going to win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars next year.

0684833395|5.0|This book is so good, my weak attempt at a review is not going to do it justice. But I'll try.     I knew before I was half-way through that this is going to be a favorite and I plan to re-read it immediately. The writing is so fresh, the character studies so sharp, and the satire so relevant in today's increasingly bureaucratic (corporate) society, no wonder it was so hard for me to find a used copy. It's definitely a book I plan to hold onto and enjoy re-reading every year.    Anyone who's ever worked for a big corporation (like myself) can identify with Heller's hilarious and angry take on bureaucracy. Gen. Peckem's quote reads like a line from Dilbert or Office Space:    \\"Just pass the work I assign you along to somebody else and trust to luck. We call that delegation of responsibility. Somewhere down near the lowest level of this coordinated organization I run are people who do get the work done when it reaches them, and everything manages to run along smoothly without too much effort on my part.\\"    It's sad how true that is in real life.    But this book is not all satire. It has a big heart. I often found myself laughing and crying at the same time. I can tell Heller cares deeply for his characters, even when he makes high comedy out of their sad fates (such as what happens to poor Doc Daneeka). He's brutally honest about the horrors of war, and laces them with enough humanity to really break your heart. It all makes the climatic \\"miracle\\" that much more satisfying. It's a satire that ends with a message of hope. And I like that.    Many people call this book ant-war, but I don't think it is. It really comes down to the last conversation btw. Yossarian and Danby. The ideals of war can be good - who can argue against rescuing Western Europe from Nazi domination. But it's the method of war - and all the evils that go with it - that makes no sense. Are these evils worth the ideals? It's a catch-22. And it's a dilemma that applies to life in general, not just towar.
0838577016|3.0|This is a great book for an all questions answered guide to neuroscience.  It has a chapter for what seems like every possible topic that could be speculated on with some certainty.  However, as a consequence of it's thoroughness, it is not the kind of text book you can just pick up and read.  In my opinion, you need to get turned on to a topic by some other source (a lecture, another text book, Wikipedia surfing) and then get the detail from this gigantic text book.<br /><br />A testament to how thick it is, because it has had a couple of trips in my backpack, its binding is starting to sag from the hard cover.<br /><br />Definitely not for the faint of heart.
B00122QC9S|5.0|It's so passe to give favorite reviews glowing reviews - it seems that if an album is beloved, it deserves some kind of classic status.     With Rocket to Russia, the Ramones  earn this album's classic status from the first groove. This captures the humor of their first LP and melds it with punk cum Beach Boys feel. Their sound is completely original, but warmly familiar, and all of the tunes are written rightly and cleverly. This isn't hardcore, but it certainly seemed hardcore when it was released (not even Saturday Night Live would touch them), and it's completely unpretentious. Even people who weren't initially fond of the Ramones have slowly come to appreciate their special genius - and Rocket to Russia captures that genius as well as any of their records. My signed copy is a prized possession.
076781326X|3.0|There certainly wasn't much care taken in restoring this movie for DVD. There are no bonus features or extras included and the picture and sound quality are nothing great.  One would expect better since it says on the case \\"remastered for high definition\\". It looks like the film was transferred from an old VHS tape, and if you have an old VHS copy of this film you might just as well keep it since it may be of better quality than this DVD.    I love the movie \\"Oliver!\\" like many other people here.  It's one of the best musicals with memorable songs, great acting, and beautiful photography.  But those who created this DVD could have given us something so much better, considering the technology that is available for restoring old films today.  I didn't pay much for this product since its price was greatly reduced here at Amazon, but it wasn't anything outstanding in quality, either.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|I was not a Sigur Ros fan before I heard their latest album.  I've listened to a few of their previous stuff, but none really caught my eye.  Until I heard Gobbledigook randomly on myspace, it just blew me away.  I heard the clips of the rest of the songs on Amazon, and ordered it.  Upon my first listen, I was completely floored.  Listening to them was a completely new experience for me.  Although I don't understand the words, their music brought tears to my eyes.  They stirred something inside my soul and brought out all kinds of emotions.  I am more likely to check out more of their previous releases because of this album.
0393327655|3.0|I wanted to like this book, and while I did agree with some of what Harris has to day, it seems superficial in many ways, particularly where he says:<br /><br />\\"It seems that if our species ever eradicates itself through war, it will not be because it was written in the stars but because it was written in our books; it is what we do with words like 'God' and 'paradise' and 'sin' in the present that will determine our future\\"<br /><br />In the not too distant past, I can cite the Vietnam War as one that had nothing to do with religion or god...and there are other examples to be had...perhaps if he had phrased this to mean it this has been the case in the past (but not exclusively) and will likely be the case in the future, especially given they myriad of conflict we are now enmeshed in.  I think Harris book would have been much more effective had he stuck to the negative effect that religion can have/is having on our government (or any democratic government for that matter), which was, I feel founded on reason and logic.  I also can't get 100% behind the idea that if we just got rid of those particular books and God that there would be no more terrorism or war in the world, I think it's in human nature (religion aside) to be warlike, selfish and cruel at times.  I agree with him that it seems unbelievably foolish to think that any book contains the literal word of God, but that has been written by men.  The idea that after 2000+ years they are in no way in need of updating and revising to take into account advances in knowledge and human understanding, is simply ridiculous.  Overall it was an interesting read, but I don't think I'd recommend this or want it for my permanent library.  I give it 3 stars.
1423367995|5.0|On the first audio disk of this series (I bought the audiobook)  there is a story about a woman whose vestibular apparatus in her  inner ear was destroyed by a destructive antibiotic.  The woman  could not even stand up she was so affected by not having any  sense of balance.  With a very simple (conceptually anyway)  electronic device that fed back accelerometer signals to an  area on her tongue she was able, not only to link her brain  into this machine outside her body speaking in mechanical  codes to her own brain, but eventually the feedback allowed  her inner neurons to silence the noise she was hearing inside  and cure herself altogether.  She no longer needs the external  device.    This is just one of the many different examples in different  dimensions that illuminates many newly discovered aspects of the  human brain.  This book is full of them.  Not only that but reading  between the lines gives one many ideas of how this kind of information  will change the world and an idea of the magnitude of the tragedy  that has been caused by human ignorance and dogma about the brain.    This story is one of many that completely turns around the ideas  most of the world has had for centuries about the nature of the  human being.  In my mind that makes this book one of the most  important and most eye opening books I have ever or will ever  read.    This book ought to be required reading for every human being,  because it is only in redefining what we are for ourselves  that the human mental world will change for the better to enable  us to meet the challenges of the future for all life on planet  Earth.    Bravo ... 5/5 stars!!!
B00005IC2H|3.0|I see from many other reviews here that the \\"pretentious\\" part of the discussion has been covered in (occasionally cutthroat) detail. I'll skip it and go straight to the album.    I freely admit that I'm a music nerd.  Obscure languages don't put me off.  Long tracks with no discernible structure?  No problem.  And yet I _still_ had to work in earnest to figure out anything on this album other than \\"Staralfur.\\"  This is thick, opaque, inscrutable stuff.  It doesn't stand up well at all to casual listening.    If you can give the album several close listens, however -- and if the unsettling edge to the preteen-sounding, sunlight-deprived vocals doesn't put you off completely -- it's worth investing the time to get to know the music better.  While the tracks divide up the album in traditional rock style, _Agaetis Byrjun_ more closely resembles a classical symphony.  There are some gorgeous passages buried in the second half of the album (sometimes several minutes into single tracks).  Once these spots become recognizable, the rest of the album will begin to fall into place.  It's not a small effort on the listener's part, but the reward is considerable.    My three-star rating would be much higher on the music's quality alone.  I wish that the artists had shared even a sliver of information about the album's lyrics, though.  They're sung with such sincerity and feeling that it's a shame to be shut out of their poetry due to a language gap.  While I respect the artists' desire to make a statement through their choice of language (and through their creativity in making up their own), the vocal lines are too structurally important to be ignored in the liner notes.  Come on, Sigur Ros.  Won't you give us non-Hopelandic speakers just a few hints?    Other than that, this is a dense and satisfying album that's worth the study time.  Great way to find out what Sigur Ros is all about.
B0018SRV3W|3.0|The good guys start off as good hunters but crappy fighters and end up as unbelievably good fighters with no interim/explanation; it doesn't seem consistent.

B0013FSL3E|3.0|WALL-E is visually stunning.  The folks at Pixar have elevated computer animation by several very large notches, and created a world that is simultaneously hyper-realistic and stylish.  The result is immersive and beautiful.  That, in my opinion, is the towering achievement of WALL-E.  As for the rest, including the story and characterizations, it's a good film, but not great, and much more a film for children than adults.  And that's disappointing, since the really great animated films have worked on two levels, and brought a degree of sophistication that could please any adult.  Not so WALL-E.<br /><br />As an aside, it is worth noting that WALL-E stands head and shoulders above the lousy computer animated movies churned out by its competitors. In fact, compared to most of the popular movies this summer, it is far more intelligent and original. So, comparatively speaking, WALL-E is well worth the price of admission and sending a signal to Hollywood that there is an audience for intelligent films and solid storytelling.<br /><br />WALL-E suffers most from dragging on.  It felt bloated and unnecessarily long, particularly given the straightforward story.  The result is that much of the movie after WALL-E departs his home is repetitive both in beats and tone.  I kept wanting the movie to get to the point, which was, unfortunately, completely predictable.  Now, I don't expect children's movies to be entirely unpredictable.  After all, we're talking about an audience that probably needs as much of the familiar as the unfamiliar.  But, I kept waiting for WALL-E to get to the clearly telegraphed point.  It, eventually, did.<br /><br />There were some truly tender moments between WALL-E and Eve.  And, unlike some other Pixar efforts, like Finding Nemo, human beings, while generally disgusting, are given a glimmer of character and decency.

Delightful, unpredictable, and vastly more satisfying that WALL-E.<br /><br />Given the amount of gushing over this movie, you'd think folks were starved for decent movies.  Truth is, they are.

0679746323|4.0|I enjoyed the book in the sense that it provided an enormous amount of detail and precise anecdotes to back up it's thesis. It provided a well written and interesting account of Mao's rule. I read the book rather briskly as I found some of the detail to be ecessive or tedious. Much of the book was not comprised of things that were unheard about the story of Mao sofar as the invasion of by Japan etc.   What was original and rather interesting about the book was the connection made with Soviet Russia. The authors used the relatively recently released Soviet (92 i believe) archives to the best of their abilities and provided an interesting connection between Moscow's communism and Mao's. While I found the book to be longwinded at times it presents new information as well as old in an interesting and engaging manner. It is definetly not a quick read by any means but can definitely be worth it for those interested in the origins of Chinese communism and are willing to sift through 700 (ish) pages of matierial.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I had no idea how this song was born.  This is a great movie of a great songs real meaning.  This movie took me to a whole other learning experience reading books that come from this era.  We should all be so strong in moral beliefs & it would be a much better world.  This one is  one the family can sit down and watch.  Teach the children how important matters should never be forgotten.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie was just a stunning package of everything - heartbreaking music, touching characters, and a storyline that teeters between children and adult.    The movie starts off in a horribly depressing post-apocalyptic-looking wasteland, which sadly, is Earth, after having been abandoned by humans for 700 years and is still covered in garbage. Wall-E, the roving garbage compacting robot, has been performing his task ever since the humans left Earth. In all the time alone, he has developed a curious and lovable personality, and he has created countless sky-scraper tall towers out of little compacted trash cubes. While we see the depressing images of the skeletons of Wall-E's kind broken among trash heaps, Wall-E moves among abandoned highways, with his little cockroach pal and a lunch cooler in which he collects his favorite trinkets.    I knew this movie was supposed to be about a lonely robot, but I almost think that Wall-E doesn't even feel nearly as lonely as the viewer when they see the barren landscapes on Earth's surface. They did an incredibly job portraying the tragedy that befell the Earth and Wall-E's loneliness.    I'm sure most people reading this know that Wall-E has a sleek, high-tech girlfriend named Eve. It's not love at first sight for the two, however. Eve arrives on the Earth's surface with the task of finding and retrieving and forms of vegetation. Her mission is hopeless until Wall-E shows her a little plant seedling he found and saved in an old boot. She is taken back into space, as Wall-E clings desperately to the side of the ship to follow Eve wherever she may go - to the new home of the humans, a ship called the Axiom.    Wall-E struggles to win Eve's heart and protect his little seedling, as the captain tries to navigate the ship back to Earth, Eve realizes what Wall-E goes through for her, and the ship's computer Auto refuses to let that happen.    You will also meet an adorable team of misfit robots including a vacuum bot with allergies,a boxing massage bot, and the not-so-misfit OCD cleaning bot, Mo.    Aside from a couple adorable robotic sound effects, Eve and Wall-E's small vocabulary, a few old holographic videos still playing on Earth, and a few conversations between Auto and the captain, this movie really communicates without dialogue. Wall-E and Eve have a surprising array of emotional expressions, and you can't help but feel like these little robots have more human-like emotions than the actual humans themselves.    I've never really been a Pixar fan because I was afraid that 3D is killing 2D animation, but Wall-E entirely restored my faith. This is definitely a movie I could watch over and over.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout dvd was highly recommended by friends and now I recommend it too.  I LOVE that the workout is under 30 minutes, including warm-up and cool-down.  It is hard to make time for exercising, but with this workout, I am making good use of my time.  It is thorough, hard, and to-the-point.  I really like the 3-2-1 (weights, cardio, abs) because it keeps you pushing hard and makes the time go by fast.  But don't get fooled- this will make you sweat and you will feel it the next day.  The first level started off intense with push-ups, but the cardio didn't quite push me to the edge.  Then I tried level 2- the cardio is very intense and I sometimes have to stop and drink some water because my throat will get so dry from breathing so hard.  I use 3 pound weights the first time I try a new level, then use 5.  Level 2 is still very challenging for me, so I have not even attempted level 3 yet.  I am intermediate but can push myself to advanced usually.  This video has it all.  I always feel very good after, and my muscles thank me.  If you are looking for a thorough 30-min workout to transform your body, this will do the trick!  You just have to stick with it and be consistant.  Now stop reading and buy it already!  You will be glad you did.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|Remember this movie?  Pretty damn cool, isn't it?  Whether or not you believe the story being told, it still made for an entertaining movie.  And admittedly, having the \\"Based On A True Story\\" line attached does tend to add a bit more creepiness to an often told Hollywood tale.<br />I remember this being marketed more as a science fiction film, but other than the premise and the sequence near the end of the film that shows Walton's experience aboard the ship, this is really more of a mystery/drama.<br />The film tells the tale of Travis Walton and his logger buddies who witness a UFO in the mountains one night in 1975 while driving back to town.  Travis leaves the truck, is shot by a light from the ship and disappears.  His buddies return to town to tell the story, but soon find themselves suspects in Walton's disappearance.  But no matter how hard they try to convince friends, family and law officials of what they saw, they find the town turning against them and the whole thing turning into a media circus that nearly ruins their lives.  When Travis is found alive five days later, it opens a whole new can of worms.  Now no one is suspected of murder, but are now accused of trying to pull a huge hoax(ya just can't win when you get abducted, can ya?).<br />It's a fascinating movie that could have come off as corny, but ends up being rather effective.  Good performances all around by a cast of mostly character and lesser known actors including Peter Berg(writer/director of Very Bad Things and star of Wes Craven's Shocker), Craig Sheffer(Nightbreed), Henry Thomas(E.T of course!!), D.B. Sweeney(The Cutting Edge and Spawn) and Robert Patrick(everyone's favorite liquid metal robot assassin).  Sweeney may be the figure which the film revolves around, but a good chunk of the film belongs to Robert Patrick, who does a damn good job in a dramatic role.  Sweeney does a fantastic job of showing sheer terror in the spacecraft scenes, as well as his post-traumatic state.  I've always felt that both Sweeney and Patrick are  horribly underused actors.  The star power here is James Garner as the detective working on the case.  He doesn't believe a damn word of their story-even when a polygraph test shows they are all telling the truth-and is hellbent on discrediting and exposing them as fakes.<br />The alien sequence at the end of the film is very effective and creepy.  This sequence could have sunk the movie if handled wrong, but thankfully it works damn well.  Granted it's been Hollywood-ized and differs from Walton's actual account of what happened to him, but movies have to be sensationalized, right?<br />If you didn't catch this one the first time around(I don't remember it making a huge splash at the box office), I'd highly suggest seeing it.  Hell, I'd highly suggest seeing it even if you have seen it before.  It just might make a believer out of ya.t both Sweeney and Patrick are  horribly underused actors.

It was unrealistic, but not in like an enslaved co-operative mammoths kond of way kind of way, like a a tiger would never live nearly drowning in a pit full of giant man-eating birds for god knows how long kind of way. And the story line was horrible and in some parts you were left wondering if there was a storyline because you had lost track. Then when it ended you had so many questions and were left hungry for more. the one thing i will say about this is that the action scenes were good a fairly well directed. But other than that this movie sucked it is a waste of time.
B00004SA8A|4.0|To my uneducated ear this set is excellent.  But beware, the first CD of the first set sent to me, when viewed on iTunes was totally in an oriental language.  I sent the set back and the second set had the very same thing.  The first CD seems to have come from a foreign edition.  All other CDs were fine.  The paperwork was in English.
B00006IRJU|5.0|I was very pleased with how quick I received my order! I was so pleased to have found the CD on Amazon since the CD came out in the eighties!
B000SO7OL6|5.0|The BEST music to listen to any time, especially on a rainy day. Her voice and piano completely calms me, and if things seem a bit gloomy, she brings me to the bright side of things. This album has songs with lively jazz, and other songs that are slow and soothing, the base just playing the night away.<br /><br />The perfect collection of melodies, wiht the perfect deep voice of Diana Krall; this is a must have.
B00132D808|3.0|Pretty. Odd. is stark contrast to the previous album. I will hand it to the band, this album is the \\"film score\\" they were going for. The music has an entirely different mood, and almost a separate genre from what Panic at the Disco became known for. The songs are composed of melodies that seem out of place, and previously unheard at the same time.     I give it a 3. I'd give it a 2.5 if I could, simply because they did a decent job with the album, yet I'd like to give them the benefit of rounding up.
B0014KD46W|5.0|On NINE LIVES, Steve Winwood pulls together every style that he's used since he began his career in 1963, from old-school R&B to hard rock and jazzy progressive rock to progressive pop-rock to blue-eyed soul- and succeeds with every stylistic turn. He even reunites with Eric Clapton, his old mate from Blind Faith, on \\"Dirty City\\", and the result is a song with more emotion and grit than Winwood has mustered up since ARC OF A DIVER and Clapton since ANOTHER TICKET. Overall, this album successfully surveys Winwood's past even as it moves him into the future.
B000OZ2CZW|1.0|Im sorry but Rihanna has to be one of the most OVERRATED ARTIST out there today...  Her vocals, live and on record, are horrible!  This CD is just filled with annoying songs that surprisingly make hits?!?!<br /><br />Year after year Rihanna chooses to put out crap.. She has about one or two hits from each CD and then puts out a new one... for example<br /><br />1. Music of the Sun - Pon De Replay -<br />less than a year later here comes<br /><br />2. A Girl Like me - SOS [it sounds like a record on repeat..SOS please somone help me over and over again.. TRASH]<br />  -Unfaithful: Stop the crying.. a song that i have to turn off to stop my ears from bleeding<br />  -We Ride:  Should have been called we flop... this track could have been a banger if someone with stronger vocals sang it..<br /><br />3. Good Girl Gone Bad - HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST ALBUMS OF 07-08<br />  -Lead Single:  Umbrella - Umbrella is one of those songs that just made is because she had on it, at the time hot rapper JAY-Z, even with out him on it the track still sounded like she was in pain.<br />  -Don't Stop The Music:  Where do i begin with this HOMO-loving song?!?!  There is nothing good about this song.. this song is just trash<br />  -Shut & Drive:  Like DONT STOP THE MUSIC is trash.<br />  -Hate That I Love You:  NEYO sounds great on this album [he should have gave this song to a person with better vocals as well] Rihanna sounds like she is hurting.. not to mention the video was wack..<br /><br />Then she went on to Re-Release GOOD GIRL GONE BAD for some reason to add a few tracks...Nothing to excited<br /><br />  - Take A Bow: Has to be one of her better works... she DOES NOT by any means sound amazing on it but it is decent.<br /><br />IN ALL THIS ALBUM IS NOT WORTH THE HYPE... RIHANNA IS NOT TALENTED AT ALL... ITS REALLY SAD THAT FEMALE ARTIST WHO CAN REALLY SING LACK BACK UP FROM THEIR RECORD LABELS BUT FEMALE ARTIST WHO LACK IN THE SINGING DEPARTMENT ARE HYPED ABOUT ALL THE TIME
0805079831|4.0|The author and a number of the reviewers here on Amazon seem to have discovered that government uses crises to rush through legislation that it has been trying unsuccessfully to pass in prior attempts. I urge readers to check out professor Robert Higgs brilliant work [[ASIN:019505900X Crisis and Leviathan: Critical Episodes in the Growth of American Government (A Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy Book)]]. The reader will learn that this kind of opportunism knows no party and no particular ideology. In the end it's all about the accretion of power to the State for the benefit of The Governing Class at the expense of the individual. From Shay's Rebellion to the Civil War, the World Wars, the War on Drugs and the current War on Terrorism it's all the same program.    When one thinks of capitalism in a modern context one must remember that what is commonly thought of as capitalism is really fascistic state socialism. Corporations are privileged licensees, beholding to the State for their existence, and the current \\"free trade\\" initiatives are really managed trade, managed for the interests of The Governing Class who, most likely, own you.    For a revisionist view of Shay's Rebellion that bolsters this perspective read professor (University of Massachusetts) Leonard Richards' book, [[ASIN:0812218701 Shays's Rebellion: The American Revolution's Final Battle]], which is based on new documentary evidence unearthed in the University of Massachusetts archives that shows that The Governing Class have been with us all along and working diligently and consistently to undermine the American experiment in democracy.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|SEX AND THE CITY was originally designed as an un-censored sitcom which single 30-something women could relate to.  While it succeeded in that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly the show reached out to a far broader audience.  It centers around 4 middle-aged single female friends, so it's best to start out by meeting our friends.<br /><br />***Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) is the main character in the show, and the title of the show is based on a column by the same name that she writes for a NYC newspaper.  She is a bit flighty and her favorite words are \\"fabulous\\" and \\"fantastic.\\"  Her favorite drink is the Cosmopolitan and she is addicted to buying high heel shoes (she has maxed out many a credit card on shoe shopping trips!).  She discusses the issues of each episode in her column.  While a bit flakey and impulsive, her heart is in the right place in spite of some ethical lapses that she has from time to time.<br /><br />While she has  sundry short-term flings, Carrie has three major boyfriends during the show.  One of them is Aiden Shaw (John Corbett) who is just about the best fellow any girl could ask for.  Of course, Corbett is one of my favorite actors, so I'm a bit biased towards his characters.<br /><br />Carrie and Aleksander Petrovsky (Mikhail Baryshnikov) make an odd couple as they live in different worlds.  He is cultured and sophisticated, while her idea of culture is wearing $400 high heel shoes.  He is a Russian artist who is a bit over-bearing and self absorbed.  The biggest single problem is that he never seems to have any time for poor Carrie.<br /><br />The most important male figure in the show is Mr. Big (Chris Noth).  From the pilot episode on, the lives of Carrie & Mr. Big weave in & out of each other.  He is a wealthy playboy who looks like he is just stepped out of GQ magazine.  Unfortunately for Carrie, he is commitment-phobic.<br /><br />Carrie strikes out on the skin-o-meter as we only see her in sexy lingerie and occasionally a sheer blouse.<br /><br />***Miranda Hobbs (Cynthia Nixon) is a graduate of Harvard Law & is by far the most cerebral of our friends.  She is out to prove that she can make it in a man's world.  She and Carrie have a special connection.  She is the most cynical character on the show, and she complains the most about not being able to find Mr. Right.  Strange as it is, she eventually discovers that Mr. Right was right in front of her nose in the character of a bartender named Steve (David Eigenberg).<br /><br />On the skin-o-meter, Miranda takes her top off occasionally.<br /><br />***Charlotte York (Kristen Davis) is my favorite character, and I doubt that I'm alone in that.  She is a true Romantic and a dreamer.  She imagines her knight in shining armor rescuing her from being single and providing her life with a fairy-tale ending.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Charlotte, the knight who rescues her (Trey, played by Kyle MacLachlan)  ends up being a decent fellow who has serious intimacy problems.  He is also from a rather arrogant family with an especially annoying mother.<br /><br />Charlotte eventually trades in Trey for a regular-Joe lawyer named Harry (Evan Handler).  Like Miranda, she finds that her soul-mate fits very few of her pre-conceived notions of what he would be like.  She isn't even physically attracted to him, but falls in love with his big generous heart.<br /><br />On the skin-o-meter, Charlotte is briefly topless & 1/2 topless in the episodes FRENEMIES and ANCHORS AWAY.  We see her lovely posterior for a few seconds on WOULDA, COULDA, SHOULDA.<br /><br />****Samantha Jones (Kim Catrall) is the most promiscuous of our 4 friends.  She is anti-relationship, and prides herself on being thus.  For her, the only use men have is to fulfill her carnal desires.  As such, Samantha and Charlotte are antipodes.<br /><br />In spite of her cynical outlook, a young stud named Smith Jarrod (Jason Lewis) eventually changes her mind about the futility of having genuine human relations with the male gender.<br /><br />While the 4 characters are all very different, they all share a love for fashion;  they literally never wear the same outfit twice.  {Alas, a jeans & T-shirt fellow like myself would be apt to be out-of-place trying to date any of them}.  Some of the stuff they wear is a bit outrageous & over-the-top;  particularly some of the dresses that Carrie dons.<br /><br />While the show on a superficial level is a light-hearted comedy, it tackles some very serious issues such as:  surviving cancer, fertility problems / wanting to have a baby, unexpected pregnancies, deciding whether or not to get married and also caring for elderly relatives afflicted with Alzheimers.<br /><br />Ultimately, the #1 reason I love the show so much is due to the fact that each of the 4 central characters share a zest for life.  They show us (both men & women) that being single is supposed to be fun as opposed to seeming hopeless.  While the constant tributes to New York City occasionally gets old for a midwesterner like myself, it is also pretty honest as to how New Yorkers think of themselves & their city.  In any case, each & every time I watch SEX AND THE CITY I always feel like I'm having lunch with 4 of my favorite friends.  I feel as though their struggles and triumphs are my own, given that I can vicariously relate to so many things they go through.  Kind of odd for a single heterosexual male to admit that, eh?ery different, they all share a love for fashion;  they literally never wear the same outfit twice.  {Alas, a jeans & T-shirt fellow like myself would be apt to be out-of-place trying to date any of them}.

B00005JPNZ|2.0|I absolutely love the Indy movies, however this one does not compair to the first three.  Bad CGI, bored/poor acting, too much action-not enough story line, the whole thing felt very, very forced.  The should have gone with the script written in 2003 Indiana Jones and the City of The Gods...a better script.  I would have much prefered to see that on the big screen than what they did make.<br /><br />As much as I love the series I'll buy the Director's Cut (If they put one out) I want to see if there is something that I missed, or something that is missing.  But this was NOT their best work and I've loved a lot of Lucas, Spielberg and Ford movies.<br /><br />If they dare take on Indy V, I'll see that one too, but I think they need to really consider the storyline...I don't think they have the balls to make an Indy V...so if they should ever read this post (which I doubt) but I'll dare them to make another one...and this time impress me.  Lucas, Spielberg and Ford make some WONDERFUL movies, use that incredible movie making genius next time and stop just making stuff for another paycheck!<br /><br />I'll give it a 2 star because Ford is still Indiana Jones.

B00008CLOA|5.0|Well this is what Quadrophonic was promising in the late 60's, however with a quality that we could never have dreamed of then. The full effect of the project as only they heard it when they recorded originally can be heard in your listening room. The better your system and the better the set up brings you as close as you will ever get to \\"being there.\\" That's because this remix will never be the weakest link. It is outstanding.    Old and new at the same time. There is nothing else like it for this reason.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|The Jack Reacher series is great. Some of the best parts are snippets of his past history as an MP major. This book has more of his history than any other.
B0012Q732O|4.0|The movie starts out with a great depiction of what life might have been like 12,000 years ago.  Great mammoth hunt scenes, use of tools, shelter, depiction of tundra...if you teach 5th grade or up and cover the stone age and the beginning of agriculture these aspects of the movie are great.  Unfortunately, the movie depicts pyramids being built some 7,000 years before they actually were and other historical inaccuracies.  However, again, if you teach units on Stone Age, Mesopotamia, Egypt, etc., this movie can serve as a great critical thinking text as students analyze the events in the movie for historical accuracy.  On top of this it is exciting and has NO \\"inappropriate\\" parts - no sex, swearing, etc.
0375842381|3.0|I read this series solely because of all the anti-religious hype created by Christians surrounding the movie \\"The Golden Compass.\\" I'm a Christian myself and believe that Christians are a fickle bunch of people who get excited about the littlest of things, so I thought I'd read this series for myself and decide if it was truly anti-religious or not.    The conclusion I came to was: yes and no. The first two books barely touch religion at all. Sure, we mention the church and some of the weird and evil things the church is dabbling in. But the church scenes are few and far in between. The Golden Compass is more the story of Lyra traveling all over creation with a ton of different characters. Some people praise the first book as being very exciting and whatnot, but I find it absurd in many cases all the things Lyra does. I frankly don't care about her adventure or what she is doing at all. And the first three or four chapters of the book--entirely boring. Some people write that they were hooked within the first few pages--I don't see how that's possible. The first chapter was the worst chapter of the entire series. I would've put the book down right then and there but I kept reading, hoping to find what all the controversy was about.    And I couldn't find much controversial in the first two books. Many people write that these books aren't for children. Perhaps you could argue that the violence is too much, or some of the weirder parts are too much (like the group of people that drill holes in their skulls. What's that all about?). But from a religious standpoint, there's nothing in these first two books that's going to derail a child's faith and make him or her into an atheist.    The thing that bothered me the most about the first book (and all the books really) was the concept of daemons. What's the point of them? They serve no purpose at all! Pan rarely talks to Lyra, and when he does, he has nothing interesting to say. Why? Because he is Lyra! He's just an outwardextention of her. Daemons rarely contribute anything in the fight scenes, they rarely do anything practical. They are simply there for cute purposes. In The Golden Compass, the kids think it's SO HORRIBLE that daemons are separated from their partners, but as a reader, I could care less. And that's bad that I don't care about daemons, because the Golden Compass is largely focused on them.    [...]    The second book wasn't much better than the first. Other reviewers point out Will's stoic nature and the cliched plot of sick mother, father gone left him. I must admit, though, that the subtle knife and the altheithometer are two very cool fantasy items. The amber spyglass, however, was introduced way too late in the third book and isn't that impressive at all. I could've done without it.    The third book is where everybody has problems with, in a literary and religious sense. First literary. The book has too much going on at once. The angels. The intention craft. Mary's spill into another world with wheeled creatures. None of this is needed. Metatron? As somebody else said, Metatron feels more appropriate in a Japanese mecha anime.     The most exciting part of the book was the land of the dead scene, which I felt was a satisfying explanation of death, but the scene was way too long. I was waiting for the church stuff to explode wide open, but it never did. Throughout the whole series we are told how bad the church is, but we never really see them taken on and attacked. Instead Pullman's church does not in any way reflect the real church of today, so it's hard to take any of his criticisms seriously.    And then we get to the confrontation with the Authority. Completely anticlimatic. And it comes roughly 2/3 through the book? This is the first book I've ever read where somebody kills God, and the scene with God was only a few pages and not what I was expecting.     And what happens after God dies? The story drags on and brings up unnecessary details. Daemons being separated. Will getting a daemon. Another convoluted explanation of Dust. And windows needing to be closed up. It goes on and on past the point of caring for this reader.    In the end: I'm glad to have read the series, I won't sell it but I probably won't read it again. The criticism of Christianity didn't bother me because the Christianity of Pullman in no way correlates with the real Christianity of our world. If the church really was like the church in the book, then I too would become an atheist. But it's not. Parents have nothing to fear from this book. I suspect most kids will have a hard time really following the criticism of religion. In all, a substandard fantasy work that will only be remembered for being the first major fantasy work by an atheist targeted at children. I think people who praise this series are more in love with the IDEA of an atheist fantasy story than they are with the actual execution of the story.
B00140PK6O|5.0|What a marvelous mini series featuring so many top Brit performers, and introducing some younger stars of the very near future. Judi Dench is always a force of nature. In \\"Cranford\\" her comic ability combines with a vulnerability she seldom uses.    Technically this DVD set manages to capture marvelous picture and sound.    I consider this set a great value. I know I will enjoy watching it many more times over the years, especially as its younger performers become very famous.
B000QQH4YS|4.0|I was really looking forward to getting this DVD and it didn't disappoint.  The video quality was crisp and clean and the audio was excellent.  The extra features were a little thin and very recycled, but otherwise this was a great addition to my library.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|a stirring, inspiring and emotionally powerful album that brings unexpected acoustic elements to their sound. The songs are well-written and composed snapshots of epic, visionary ideas and themes that take the listener into other realms from diverse times and places. Eno's touch is evident in delightful ways; and who is not amused by the playful borrowings from such bands as The Cure and U2? Coldplay wears their admirable influences on their multicolored sleeves better and more uniquely than all the other Radiohead devotees.<br /><br />Music for the Masses by a lead singer (and band) who evolved into something surely beyond his greatest expectations. VLV, indeed!

1416914293|4.0|I was surprised by the number of negative reviews because I found this to be an original and exciting series.  Despite some of the dialogue trying too hard to be \\"kewl\\" at times, I thought the plot was excellent, the world well developed and intriguing, and the writing to be first rate.  Clare's descriptions of places and characters are terrific and sometimes beautiful, particularly in this installment (it was more uneven in the first).  I really like all the characters, I care about them, despite some of them occasionally being annoying - but that's like real people.  And I'm impressed with the chance she has taken with the main love story (I don't want to put a spoiler here) - it takes some courage to promote a love story like that.  I like the chances that Clare takes and can't wait to read City of Glass!
B000W4KT6E|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal ensemble cast!  Nikki Blonsky as our heroine Tracy Turnblad is fresh and delightful with star power to spare!  John Travolta's Edna Turnblad is endearing and unlike any gender bending performance I've ever seen.  It's not a \\"man\\" playing a \\"woman\\" - he embodies Edna and you can easily forget that she's being played by a man!  Christopher Walken as Edna's husband, Wilbur, is just (as Edna defines him) the shiniest white knight ever!  During his big dance number with Travolta, you can see he is genuinely enjoying his \\"wife!\\"  Amanda Bynes could be my favorite!  She delivers her one liners with perfection and I believe she could be the next generation Lucille Ball - just watch this girl's facial expressions!  Her comedic timing is flawless.  James Marsden is always easy on the eyes and is perfectly cast.  Queen Latifah, Zac Efron, and Brittany Snow - they are all superb!  Michelle Pfeiffer is delightfully cruel and watching her chew up the scenery as well as the other cast members is great fun.  This is one to watch over and over again!  Integration is the new frontier!  :)
B000VD5I94|3.0|Unfortunately I have to say that the benefits from High Definition are not to be found in this BluRay edition, video quality is grainy and essentially not worth as an upgrade for the already great Criterion Collection edition.

B00003CY5J|4.0|The Score is a good film with great performances.    Overall, I enjoyed the film. The caper to steal the sceptre was complex because of the high tech security, yet it was met with an ingenious theif that used low-tech equipment to combat their systems.  The jazz theme of NYC's represented improvisational way that many thieves worked in this film.  DeNiro, also, (uncredited) directs Brando in many of the scenes here. Brando's character is flashier (as a fence) because he has to convince DeNiro's character to break his own rules to steal the scepter.  Seeing the legendary Marlon Brando in a role where he didn't have much screentime, but giving you a performance where you could laugh with his character and feel empathy for the character by the end of the film shows his genious.  I, also, loved Edward Norton in his dual role as the younger theif and as the night custodian Brian.  Norton didn't phone in his acting here.  He had me convinced at his first appearance that he was this mentally challenged guy on the streets of Montreal.  I was just as taken aback as Nick (DeNiro's character) to find out that this guy was a hustler.  Deniro's character, Nick, played a low-key smooth operator in this film. As a jazz club owner of NYC's (Nick's - get it?) he enjoyed that lifestyle.  Who wouldn't with the cool jazz artists that he had coming through performing there?  The set was a place that made you want to visit NYC's. It was, also, indicative of this man's personality.  On the other hand, he was ready to retire from the life of being a jewel thief; plans to settle with Diane (Angela Bassett) and own his club outright made him think it was worth the stretch.    Angela Bassett did a great job for the few times she was onscreen.  The chemistry between her and DeNiro was great and credible although brief.  She did show a reason why this guy would go for the final heist although other elements that he normally didn't take risk for kept coming into play.  I think his acting withoutsaying a word after he buzzed her in indicated just how much he anticipated her visit with him, and shows his affection for this woman. Plus, he cooks a nice meal for her. How often do you see DeNiro's characters being so tender, romantic and subtle like that in a film?
0743289692|5.0|Submission and degradation of women in the Muslim faith is certainly not a new or unrevealed topic, but this personal account by Hirsi Ali brings insight and understanding that one can not achieve through news articles and other written factual documentation. I applaud Ms. Ali for her courage to come forth and expose the errors of her former religion (which is no easy task) with the hope that the atrocities against Muslim women will eventually come to an end. Women of all faiths and nationalities should read this book and more like it to remind us that we still have a long way to go to accomplish true equality with men.
B000LXISE6|4.0|I am a die-hard Josh Groban fan and own every DVD and CD he has produced.  This CD, while enjoyable, is not his best.  (My sister describes it as \\"Josh Groban Light.\\")  It is very much \\"pop\\" music and doesn't really showcase his incredible vocal technique.  Lots of falsetto.  But, all artists are entitled to experiment with their art, and all patrons are entitled to experience it.  So, it was a good experiment, but I hope he goes back to doing more of what he did with his first two albums.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I loved watching this on HBO and couldn't wait to get a copy for myself.  I would recommend this to any history buff.
6305428352|5.0|I must confess that before writing this review, I read some of the lower-rated reviews first.  It seems that the common complaint is that it's over-sentimental, over-dramatic, etc.  I even read one in which the reviewer said it \\"glosses over\\" the tragedy of the music program being cut, and shouldn't have been a happy ending.    Okay, well, I am a music teacher.  I can honestly say that the threat of budget cuts and loss of arts programs is a very real fear that we live with from year to year.  We have more work than any other teacher and, in many cases, less respect.  Mr. Holland's plight is not terribly exaggerated.  Furthermore, his effect on his students is not exaggerated either.  I haven't been teaching long enough to have that much impact on my students (one semester of student teaching doesn't really change lives), but I have watched enough music teachers to know that they have a profound influence on students.  The concepts in this movie are certainly not made up.    This movie is beautiful, and shows not only Mr. Holland's virtues, but his flaws as well -- and how he overcomes them.  No one likes the idea of a teacher falling for his beautiful student.  No one likes the idea of a father avoiding his son simply because he is deaf.  But he overcomes these things, and that is what matters!  Throughout his career, he grows as a person and touches many lives.  That is what makes this movie beautiful.
B00004R9A4|5.0|I remember when I was a little kid moving from Germany to the States.  I loved this movie very much.  I grew up watching this movie all the time.  I just recently started searching for all the old movies that I grew up on and this is the first one I looked up.  I want my kids to be able to see all the movies that I got to watch when I grew up.  Even at 30 years old and having been in the army for 10 and a half years I still am kid at heart.  Thank you amazon.com for having all these great movies.
B00133KFGW|4.0|The first half hour of this movie is ridiculously slow.  I must admit that the first time I saw this movie, I was very bored at first.  And, the love story cliché is nothing original.  \\"Oh noes, my rockstar boyfriend is gone!!\\"  Seen it all before.    But, honestly, I got something much different out of this movie than most people seem to have gotten.  While other people seem to be focused on the love story, or that August is a musical prodigy, or that he is bound and determined to find his parents, or what have you, all of that seemed secondary to me.  To me, the real story is how music affects us all, no matter who we are or what kind of music we make.  August's dad is a guitarist and a rock singer who quits his music only to return later, because his life is incomplete without it.  His mother is a classically trained cellist who becomes a music teacher as well as a performer.  Wizard turns to music as a means to an end (teaching the children to play so they can make money for him) and as a source of comfort (playing the harmonica when he loses his best student).  All of the professors at Julliard are moved by the music that August creates.  Is music not the real star of this movie?  Freddie Highmore's character is just a facilitator.  Music the true star here.  Thus, I give this movie 4 stars.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought the Nikon SB 800 flash for my Nikon D50 after the built in flash stopped working.  I quickly realized that it was a wonderful flash, and very powerful, but much too large.  I started shopping around for other options, and bought the SB 400 not long after.  It is less than half the size of the 800, but just as powerful as far as the flash goes.  There are more features and gizmos on the 800, but I found that I never used those anyway.  I just wanted a flash that would work!  And this does that and still has perks:    -The tilt-up head of the flash is wonderful.  You can aim the flash at different angles so that you arent hitting the subject head on.  This reduces red eye and harsh shadows.    -It mounts easily and securely, and lights up a whole room without being heavy and in the way.      -It is very quick, you hardly have to wait at all for the flash to recharge after shooting.  I rarely even notice a lag.      I would reccomend this flash to anyone!
0061150142|3.0|If you are a new reader of Picoult I don't think this will be the book that hooks you.  If you are searching to buy a Picoult book I would strongly suggest My Sister's Keeper.  While The Pact was interesting at time I felt some aspects were a bit slow moving.  Hope this helps.
0767812387|5.0|As a heavy-duty ballroom dance fan, I found this the best of all the ballroom dance films -  for sheer talent. I had no idea Vanessa Williams was that good a ballroom dancer, let alone such a fine actress and a stunning woman. Chayenne, not the best actor around, is nevertheless somewhat sweet and charming but he cannot hold a candle to the firepower of the professional ballroom dancers. The scenes where the competitions take place are fabulous, using real ballroom dance champions, doing real, not bastardized, ballroom dancing.    The story-line behind the dancing (and it *is* behind the dancing) is a nice one but predictable. Chayenne is a Cuban immigrant on a trip to meet his American father (Chris Christofferson), who doesn't know Chayenne is his son, fathered by him in an old love affair aboard a cruise ship. Chayenne arrives to do handyman work at Christofferson's dance studio and the latter soon realizes Chayenne is his son, which creates tension between them. To me, that aspect of the film was padding and could easily have been omitted in favor of more dancing.     The better parts have to do with a clash in dance style between Vanessa Williams' character and Chayenne's but they work it out and it becomes great fun to watch the two free-form dancing together, and dancing with others at small night clubs.    Truth to tell, I wish there were far more ballroom dance movies of high quality like this one. The other ballroom dance movies are built more around love stories, such as \\"Strictly Ballroom\\". \\"Shall We Dance\\", with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez is also good but doesn't have the professional spark that \\"Dance With Me\\" reveals.    (Not that this has much to do with ballroom dance, but I am still waiting for some hugely talented person to release a high-quality DVD of just Fred Astaire's dances. JUST the dances with dates, partners, name of film; no interviews, no talking, just his dances, with and without partners. If anyone knows of such a DVD, I'd sacrifice my firstborn for it!)
B0000257U0|5.0|Even with the absence of Bobby Kimball, Steve Lukather's vocal's are brilliant.  This album has to be one of Toto's best studio recordings along with their latest Falling in Between.  Toto's blueprint for musical perfection as a progressive rock band is hard to beat.  The band just keep getting better & better.
B00030590I|5.0|This one of the most truly beautiful movies I have laid my eyes on. And not just from a visual feast, but the musical score by Tan Dun and epic storyline all together makes for a remarkable, unique combination. The clever use of different colours with the martial arts in different moods of the movie was breathtaking. Its one of those rare gems that can be watched many times and gives a cleansing effect to the soul.
6305090564|1.0|The studios make lots of trash that gets buried in unmarked graves, showing up on local channels with lots of commercial interruptions (but showing the same couple of commercials over and over), leading us to wonder, \\"was this movie ever in theatres?\\" This movie is just bad. It is very suspicious that this unremarkable bad movie should attract so many reviews, and that they are overwhelmingly positive. There are a few inexpensive special effects created with care (the ocean liner model that gets blown up, the computer graphic tentacle monster). The monster is an extremely slithery version of the alien in Alien, you know, it opens an orifice in what is supposed to be its head and then there's another head (or whatever). Every time the creature bursts into a room, it looks the same. The riding around on the jet ski in the boat at the end is some terrible low budget movie making. Not a classic bad movie, but bad enough to regret wasting time watching it.
B00000AFWW|4.0|This is the first Courtney Love led band album I have purchased and I shall be coming back for more. Album begins with rock anthem Celebrity Skin, and varies between melodic rhythms such as Heaven Tonight and rocking beats. The lyrics sway between strong emotions such as anger and relief at survival, it gives one hope that no matter how bad a situation is things will always improve eventually. Its contagious. Highly recommend it.
0452289963|5.0|Start with this one and then read \\"The Power of Now\\"  (both versions short and long)  read 'Stillness Speaks' last.  It's the best way to get the whole message.  It will change your life
B000XTLUW0|5.0|This is the second live album Muse have produced and it is EXCELLENT. The sound quality is superb, the recording work is beautiful and the band as always never disappoint during their live performances.   The only complaint I have is that they omitted the songs Bliss and Citizen Erased however I imagine including those songs in an already blistering 2.5 hour set would have been a bit too much for the band. Highly recommend it.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I don't think I realized how much was put into the concert until I watched how many songs were included.   It's basically just the songs, with a little bit of the \\"between-song\\" stuff included. I would love to have seen more of the between stuff, since I didn't actually attend the concert, but, perhaps next time.  Overall, sound and picture seem good quality - at least on my little 19inch t.v. :)
0553583182|1.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a co-worker. She said, \\"My uncle swears by this book. It's like his bible.\\" Then she went on about how important it was to maintain positive thoughts.     Soon, another co-worker joined in and she began talking about \\"The Secret.\\" It's another book with basically the same philosophy, just modernized with examples for today's generation.     There are dozens of books in print like \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,\\" the first of which is probably your favorite religious text. Given that, Subconscious Mind is a good book, but it requires a great deal of unwavering, unquestioning faith, even in the midst of obstacles, to believe. On one hand, the book makes no claims about the existance of God. On the other hand, if you have faith in nothing, the book forces you to believe in \\"something\\" because it's impossible to get something when \\"nothing\\" is involved.     Which brings me to my point. If you believe that reading this book will change your life, you can be almost certain that it will. For some, it will give them cause to renew their faith. And for others, it will reinforce their belief that the only way to get something done is not by sitting on the sidelines and hoping, but by getting out there and doing something about it.    Your best bet is to save your money and tap into the power you already have. You don't need to pay a publisher your hard earned money to tell you things you already know. Reading a free copy of a trusted religious text will basically give you the same results.
B0013V33DG|5.0|As another reviewer has noted, this Covent Garden production was recently (spring 2008) performed at the Met in New York.  I had the pleasure of seeing that production via the Met's closed circuit HD broadcasts.      While I am on that subject, I congratulate and thank the Met for those broadcasts.  While not quite the same as being in Lincoln Center for the live performance, it is the next best thing.  Those of you who are opera lovers and have not yet discovered or attended those broadcasts should buy your tickets for the 2008-09 season.      Natalie Dessay is a petit French soprano whose acting ability, especially in this comic opera, and whose energy level, matches her excellent musicianship and beautiful voice.  Juan Diego Florez, a Peruvian tenor with a light lyric yet powerful voice, matches her perfectly.  Alessandro Corbelli is superb as the Sergeant protector.  A special treat is the speaking role of Felicity Palmer.      Unfortunately I have not yet seen the Teatro Carlo Felice production reviewer Toni Bernhard referred to in an excellent write-up.  But I have seen Natalie Dessay live in Lucia di Lammermoor at the Met and can tell you that she is an outstanding actress and made the famous \\"mad scene\\" totally convincing.      Florez is well launched on a successful career in comic opera that I believe will see him grow into true stardom in the years to come.      All in all a very worthy opera DVD.
B00000GAIW|5.0|When people talk about progressive rock being dull and dated and pretentious, they surely can't be thinking of Aqualung. Jethro Tull's gospel-weary opus may be full of flute solos and lyrics about man's relationship to God, but it still rocks more righteously than anything Guns `N' Roses ever did. There's not a Moog synthesizer or an extended suite to be found (except for the title track, and it's not really all that extended), and pyrotechnical displays of instrumental prowess are kept to a tasteful minimum. Classical influences share space with strains of blues, folk, and a bit of gospel. The lyrics, even when they become abstract, make sense more often than not, and they're almost always poignant. The band even insists that it isn't a concept album, and sometimes it seems that they might actually be telling the truth! So, if it makes you feel uncomfortable, don't consider Aqualung a prog rock album. Just think of it as a blistering rock `n' roll record that happens to be, well, smart.     And then listen to it. Let that ludicrously good title track smash you in the gut. Listen to Ian Anderson's grizzled sneer, to that insistent guitar riff, to the sudden (and totally cool) tempo changes, to those fantastic lyrics. It's one of the greatest album openers ever, and it isn't even the best song here. That honor probably goes to \\"Hymn 43,\\" a barnstorming surge of mutant gospel that burns with Biblical fury and melodic intensity. The lyrics are sheer bombastic brilliance, a scathing indictment of opportunistic religious leaders and human selfishness. My personal favorite line on the album has to be \\"and the unsung Western hero/ he killed an Indian or three/ then he made his name in Hollywood/ to set the white man free/ ah, Jesus save me!\\" Either that or \\"if Jesus saves/ well he'd better save himself.\\" Other brilliant songs about organized religions and their failure to bring man closer to God (hey, maybe it really is a concept album!) include \\"My God\\" and \\"Wind Up,\\" andboth of them drip with dark genius. \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" ain't so bad either. I also love \\"Mother Goose,\\" with its poetic childhood imagery and vaguely Medieval melody (okay, I guess it really is a prog rock album), and \\"Locomotive Breath,\\" which rules on every level. Just like the rest of the album.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|A few years ago when Disney announced they would no longer produce the traditional 2-D animation, I feared that we might lose the classic Disney films that touched both parents and children.  Thankfully, Pixar's amazing animation, combined with good storylines and endearing characters, have put that fear to rest.<br /><br />  \\"Wall-E\\", Disney/Pixar's latest offering is a charming tale of a little garbage-compacting robot left on Earth after its inhabitants escape the planet's damaged environment, poisoned by years of pollution and excessive refuse.  Wall-E goes about his daily routine, condensing trash and collecting little artifacts that amuse him.  His one companion is a cockroach (because we all know they can survive anything!) but he yearns for a friend and partner.  When a huge ship arrives and leaves a sleek and fetching robot, whom we later learn is named Eve, Wall-E is blinded by love.<br /><br />  When Eve completes her mission on Earth and leaves, Wall-E becomes a stowaway and travels to the AXIOM, the ship holding the escaped citizens of Earth.  After hundreds of years of being coddled and pampered by robots for all their needs, humanity has become overweight, mindless and helpless.  Wall-E and Eve, with a group of misfit robots, are determined to return the people to their home planet, which again shows the capacity for nuturing and sustaining life.<br /><br />  Disney has managed to make a touching and comical tale that will appeal instantly to people of all ages.  Adults will love the sophisticated humor as well as the movie references peppered throughout the film and kids will enjoy Wall-e's clumsy and humorous ways.  While some people may worry about the lack of dialogue, I believe they will find that this enchanting little fella will steal their hearts with only a handful of words.  Wall-E's expressions easily convey his emotions and are bound to tug at your heartstrings.  The movie also offers good messages about love and friendship as well as the danger of over polluting our home, a message that can't be stressed enough.  And, as usual, the animation is beautiful and captivating.<br /><br />  \\"Wall-E\\" is bound to become one of Disney/Pixar's classic animated films.  This little gem is a treat for the entire family.  Highly recommended for all!!!!r of over polluting our home, a message that can't be stressed enough.

B000NY133G|4.0|I'm not sure that it matters if you believe or don't believe totally in The Secret.  The book is filled with some thought provoking ideas and concepts.  It is one of those books that makes you think in a slightly different way.  You begin to think about things from a point of control.  It's very powerful to take control over your thoughts and feelings.  That was the biggest thing that I got from the book.<br /><br />I don't necessarily believe in all the concepts within The Secret.  I do however believe in some of them.  The power of the law of attraction is amazing.  I've found that applying, if only just a little, in my life has made a difference.  It brings me more confidence and I feel more empowered to take risks.<br /><br />You don't have to feel as it you are joining a cult to enjoy this book. Just go into with an open, but discriminating mind and you will find a few things that you can apply to your everyday life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1582701881 The Science of Getting Rich]][[ASIN:B001AO16WG Hemp Eco Friendly Dog Bone Toy: Pink (Large)]][[ASIN:B001A4BF36 Robbie Dawg Organic Dog Biscuits: Turkey Sausage & Romano Cheese]][[ASIN:B001AOEC1S Organic Quilted Car Seat Cover: Silver]][[ASIN:B001BC0ZLU Organic Catnip Leaf (Small)]][[ASIN:B001BSQBLM Eco Friendly Pet Shammy]][[ASIN:B0019MT9VY Hurley Dog Chew Toy: Aqua Blue (Large)]]
0380973650|5.0|I read this before his Sandman books (Comics/Vertigo) and I was hooked.<br />It is a great read in the sci/fi fantasy genre, with old Mythical creatures, Norse Gods, Greek Gods, New Gods and others Gaiman dips into nearly every mythology to create a masterpiece of modern fantasy filled with Humor and wit.
0156030209|1.0|The book started out very well with describing a zoo in India and the different animals. But the rest was awful. It has so many loose points and the whole story of the boy and the tiger in the lifeboat is just ridiculous. I think if one wants to argue of faith in God vs atheism should pick a better more realistic story.

0739476475|3.0|It goes without saying that Stephen King is perhaps the most popular and prolific writer in modern history. And dedicated King readers will have noticed the evolution that his writing has gone through. It started with well-crafted horror stories, whether they were short stories or epic novels. Epic either in their scale or epic in their length, as he has often described himself as having diarrhea of the word processor. Over the past 10 or so years, his writing has ventured out of the standard horror fare to more personal and character driven stories. Lisey's Story certainly falls into that category. So for those readers who prefer his in-your-face horror stories, this book might be disappointing. But if you have enjoyed his more recent works such as The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon or even Delores Claiborne, then you should truly enjoy this book. As a matter of preference, I do not describe the plots of the books I review, because even a well written synopsis can mislead a potential reader and set up expectations that may not be realized. But I do recommend this book and hope that it finds the audience it deserves.

B0013J30W2|4.0|I'm not a big Angelina Jolie fan.  She's given some fine performances in the past, true (GIRL, INTERRUPTED)...but mostly she has become a persona and not a real person.  But I have to admit, her persona is perfectly suited to play a highly-skilled assassin who really enjoys her work.  Jolie holds a gun quite convincingly.  She kills with great conviction.  And of course, she wears all the clothes of her trade with great panache.  She's come a long way since taking on Laura Kroft in TOMB RAIDER (and coming across as a bit silly).  MR. AND MRS. SMITH helped to cement her style, and in WANTED, she's perfected it.  It's not a demonstration of great acting talent...but she DOES give a performance.    WANTED tells the ridiculous story of a millennium -old \\"Fraternity of Assassins,\\" who are the most remarkably skilled killers in the world.  Apparently, a small portion of the population has an innate ability to do physics-defying things like curve the trajectory of bullets so they can fire around obstacles.  (This is the coolest thing to happen to bullets since \\"Bullet Time\\" in THE MATRIX.)  But this Fraternity, headed by Morgan Freeman, is under attack from a \\"rogue\\" assassin...one of their own.      James McAvoy is a cubicle-dwelling loser who is recruited into this group...and it is through his eyes that we see this film.  At first, we get to meet him taking grief from his boss and reluctantly accepting the fact that  his personal life is a joke as well.  He's a nerd full of pent-up rage.  But one night, Jolie whisks him away from a threat to his life in a chase scene that truly gets the blood pumping.  When she shoots out her own windshield and then climbs through the opening to fire at her pursuer over the roof of her car, and still managing to steer with her legs...the movie instantly is transported into a realm of marvelous silliness.  It's a totally cool moment that leaves you almost giddy because it dares you to say \\"no, that can't happen.\\"  If you DO say that, you'll be depriving yourself of a good time.    WANTED is a movie with a few stellar action sequences, punctuated with montages of McAvoy training and a few brief glimpses into the ways of The Fraternity.   Frankly, the story is hardly the point...it's the action.  And WANTED delivers on this score.  So let's be perfectly clear here...if you want to see a film that stimulates the mind or the heart..stay away from WANTED.  If you want the heart to get pumping and the adrenalin to flow...this film will fit the bill.    This is not to say that the film is perfect, even on this modest level.  I've now officially decided that I have very little use for James McAvoy.  I hated him in THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE and barely tolerated him in ATONEMENT (a movie I barely tolerated).  In WANTED, he plays the goofy loser convincingly, but when he's transformed into the skilled murderer...it's almost laughable how unbelievable he is.  The forward momentum of the movie, and Jolie's steely presence deflect us away from McAvoy's shortcomings...but I frequently found myself wondering what he was doing in this film.  Morgan Freeman is completely coasting in the film.  There's no doubt he has one of the silkiest voices in history, and I can always listen to him...but I can also tell he wasn't terribly engaged in all this.  A paycheck role.    Yet, I still recommend it...as long as you understand what you're getting into.  If you do accept it, then this movie might be some of the best fun you've had at the movies this summer.
0786838655|5.0|The Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan is a favorite of most of my 6th grade students.  They are so involved in enjoying the realism of the characters that they do not even realize that they are learning about Greek mythology at the same time!  I, too, have thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel (and the 3 that follow) as well as using it with my Literature classes.
6305511055|5.0|This is the second time I've simply purchased a DVD that's 'out of circulation' or not carried by any rentals like Blockbuster. Lord only knows why reruns of TV shows are easy to get but actual movies are not. Oh well, anyway it came on time, was undamaged and operated fine. Kudos.
B000QFCD5O|5.0|I have been an Asia original lineup fan for several years and both of their new recordings were quite a surprise. Songs are somewhat slower than original versions. 'Video Killed the Radio Star' has little resemblance with the Buggles version. Steve does a splendid job, guitar in 'Roundabout' sounds as in Yes several years ago. Carl is more audible than he used to be. Geoff doesn't seem affected by time. John's singing is fine but his voice denotes he may be somewhat tired. Wonderful Roger Dean artwork. Recording and sound, good.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Aliens is the best of the Alien series of films, it is one of the greatest action films ever made, and it is, along with The Terminator and The Abyss, one of the defining films of James Cameron's early career.    This DVD presents both the adrenaline pumping, oppressive, upsetting, and exciting theatrical cut, and the longer, better developed director's cut.  Both are excellent films, and for the picture to be truly appreciated, both are essential.  If one is better, it is the theatrical cut: the filmmakers were forced to jettison all but the essential pieces of the story and action, making for a brutal, exhilarating ride.    The special features are equally worthwhile, most especially the commentary and introduction by Cameron.  The film speaks for itself, however, and we should each feel individually privileged to have both versions presented to us in such excellent sound and picture quality.
B00154GEFU|5.0|Must admit I've been and Asia original lineup hardcore fan for so many years and there were few chances I'd be disappointed with Phoenix. Putting it mildly, Roger's artwork is astounding and for me this issue is as important as the music is. Recording and sound are very good. Don't see why track 3 was included in the CD.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is a beautiful movie.  Why can't we make good movies in America anymore?   Probably because we think that the more expensive they come the better they'll be. The Lives of Others proves the opposite. The budget of this movie must have been 1 percent of a Hollywood Blockbuster but the result is  a hundred times better. It's time we learnt that lesson in this country.  This movie is about how human beings can be redeemed. Without preeching and always very subtly we witness the transformation of a servant of a cruel, tyrannical state into a modern day saint and that transformation is so moving that it had me in tears by the end.  I recommend this as a masterpiece.

0385751532|5.0|My wife borrowed this book from a friend who had just finished it while we were out at the beach for the weekend.  He didn't tell her what it was about except to say that it was a must read.  When I went to bed last night I picked it up and started reading it.  I woke up the next morning and finished it about an hour later...I couldn't put it down.  What a powerful story written in such a simple way about a very complex subject.  I have just finished writing my recently Bar Mitzvahed older son who is away at camp that I am going to send him this book and I am crying because the story really got to me.  I am Jewish and lost over 100 relatives to the Camps during the war.  It is sometime very hard to explain what happened during the war and especially hard to get kids to understand what happened to the Jews and others in the Camps.  This is a must read for kids and their parents.  It is very simply written so it is very easy for kids to read and understand.  Yet it is so compelling that even adult readers will appreciate it.  Most books of this genre are/were written by Camp survivors and never from the other side.  While this story does not make any effort at rationalizing or appolgizing for what the Germans did it does tell the story from that side of the fence.  This is a story that you can discuss with your kids at many levels, there are even some thought provoking questions provided in the back of the book that will make for some very interesting discussions.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I just love this album.  Damien Rice brings storytelling back to the alternative music scene.  His warm and sultry voice is reminiscent of Indian singer Tanita Tikarum, only with a slightly more positive bent to the lyrics.  The songs have a degree of continuity which makes whole album listening a pleasure.  It is filled with unexpected and delightful interjections from female vocalists.  The ample use of strings makes O both easy listening and the triumph of a contempory balladeir.

Dr. Nevel(smith) attempts to find a cure but ends up losing his best friend. if you love movies of extinction and the will power of man this movie is great! I loved it, and blue ray makes it even better than expected
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I bought this on a whim without having seen a single episode and it's so great. My husband and I watched the first disc together and we were laughing the whole time at the obvious differences between then and now - constant smoking by everyone (even a pregnant mother), constant drinking by everyone (even a pregnant mother), young kids climbing around the car without a seatbelt and of course the sexual harassment and unapologetic low opinion of women. If you've got the sense of humor to laugh at how reckless we used to be and how safe and sanitized we've become you have to pick this show up.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Take a base of alternative quirkiness.  Add a slight techno beat.  Then some high pitched vocals.  Next mix with a dash of funk.  And top it off with some power pop, and viola!  You have MGMT.  I cannot reccomend this album highly enough.  This New York based indie rock band is set to hit the big time.<br />The cd starts off with a bang hiting hard with the great track \\"Time to Pretend.\\"  And this is could be argued for as the highlight of the disc.  But if you stop there, you are selling yourself short.  \\"Electric Feel\\" almost reminds of you of a 70s disco.  And \\"Pieces of What\\" is a perfect merge of radio hooks and rock n roll.  Also not to be overlooked would be \\"The Handshake\\" and \\"Kids.\\"<br />Some people compare them to Muse, and you can see the influence there.  But the more you listen you realize MGMT are striking out into a style all their own.  Great, great cd.  Do yourself a favor.  Pick it up.  You'll be glad you did.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|My husband got me this for my birthday and I love it. I already had seasons 1-4 on DVD but I donated them to a friend and immediatley had a marathon with this box set. It's beautifully put together and so worth it if you're a die hard fan of the show like I am.
0440237688|5.0|The first time I read this book I was 10 years old, sitting in a library in my elementary school.  I can honestly say, this book has the same impact on me today, as it did thirteen years ago.  This beautifully written dark narrative on a Utopian society only becomes more relevant with time.  It lacks the seriousness of \\"Brave New World\\" but somehow manages to be taken more seriously.  Perhaps because the future described, could easily happen with today's technology.  You will love it if you are 10 or 50, highly recommended.
0316143472|2.0|When You Are Engulfed in Flames isn't very funny, and Sedaris doesn't really want it to be.  Certainly, I laughed a few times, but the quality of Sedaris' humor has changed; he relies heavily on scatological jokes and much less on wit and child-like observation.  But when the theme of your book is death and dying, scatological humor rings the truest.  After all, When You Are Engulfed in Flames is Sedaris' midlife crisis, on paper, and available for purchase at most bookstores.<br /><br />Of course, then, this alters the focus of the book.  Indeed, all of Sedaris' books are essentially about him, but When You Are Engulfed in Flames is much, much more about him.  In Naked, Sedaris fleshes out the character and human qualities of his mother.  In Me Talk Pretty One Day, Sedaris successfully creates characters for his father, his boyfriend, his grandmother, his brother, and at least two of his sisters.  As magnanimous as Sedaris is in those two books, his writing could still be read as self-centered.  But it's only in When You Are Engulfed in Flames when he populates too many essays with random, undeveloped characters, which forces the focus on him, and he makes that peculiar turn into selfishness and forgets the reader.  This is most evident in the last 80+ pages of the book when Sedaris subjects the reader to his diary as he tries to quit smoking.<br /><br />The only stories I really liked were \\"Keeping Up\\" and \\"That's Amore,\\" the latter of which is a wonderful blend of the mournful midlife crisis tone that Sedaris wants to explore, and it's also touching and funny.  The rest of the essays do not have such careful crafting.  I recommend all of Sedaris' other books, but I would pass on When You Are Engulfed in Flames.

B0013J30W2|2.0|This is a terrible movie. Even if you accept that the movie is completely fake, the story line still leaves you wondering why you just payed for this movie.     I just can't stand the rediculous, fake, over the top movies like this (shoot 'em up, etc). I was literally sitting there halfway through the movie thinking about getting up and leaving my friends.      I gave it two stars: one for decent special effects, one for morgan freeman at the end (if you've seen it you know what i'm talking about)      do not pay for this garbage
0060245867|5.0|If You Give a Mouse a Cookie is a modern classic, beloved by children everywhere.  It is also a book that teaches about sequential action and consequence.  For example, if you give a mouse a cookie, he is going to ask for a glass of milk.  If you give him a glass of milk, he will probably ask for straw.  As the book continues, the drink leads to a napkin, which leads to a mirror (to check for a milk mustache), which leads to a haircut, which leads to cleaning up, etc., and so forth.  The tale eventually comes full circle, with thirst leading to a glass of milk, which leads back to giving a mouse a cookie.  And of course, if you give a mouse a cookie...<br /><br />My three year old and I love reading this together at bedtime.  I start the sentence on each page (\\"If you give a mouse an xxxx...), and she shouts out the end of the sentence (\\",...he is going to xxxx.\\").  The result is lots of giggles which are very nice right before bedtime.<br /><br />This fun, entertaining book is beautifully illustrated with rich, detailed, colorful drawings. I highly recommend this book for small children and beginning readers, and I guarantee that it will quickly become a family favorite.
0316143472|2.0|This isn't as funny as most people claim. There was some racial undertones. Like when the drug dealer's wife called the remote control the N word. In his fallacy, David wanted to explain the difference between African Americans and a remote control to her. She never called black people the N word. She called the remote control that. Also black people just aren't people in this book. they are 'black' people. I can't understand why American writers tend to make that dinstinction. you can't just be human. you have to be black. Other than that, I still didn't find it very funny. maybe he's just old. I prefer Augusten Burroughs.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|I went in to this movie thinking I was going to see another serial-killer-as-evil-genius story. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Fincher had put together a fascinating tale of determination / obsessive dedication in the face of mounting terror. ZODIAC starts off w/ a bang, showing us the maniac in action. The murders themselves are dealt with in quick succession, leaving the majority of the film to decyphering Zodiac's codes, gathering evidence, and interviewing suspects. I love police procedurals (Forensic Files is one of my favorite TV shows), so this movie held my interest throughout. However, ZODIAC is also about the effects of such a baffling, frustratingly drawn-out case on those who relentlessly pursue it. We watch as the characters' lives are nearly consumed by Zodiac to the point of their own ruin. Jake Gyllenhaal's cartoonist character goes from being interested in the case to being taken over by it. He will not rest or stop until Zodiac's identity is revealed. I could feel his obsession grow! Mark Ruffalo is the cop who runs down leads and ultimately gives up hope (almost) entirely. Watching these two is an amazing study in doggedness and dedication. These are the guys I want working on these types of cases! At the same time, we also get a look at the tremendous toll taken. The simple things in life that are missed. The price that is paid in mental / physical burn-out, lost opportunities, and personal relationships altered or destroyed. ZODIAC reminds us that life is precious, and that obsession, even well-placed obsession, will drain our souls. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror / thriller / mystery / real-life drama, as well as to those who love a great human story... P.S.- Robert Downey, jr. and Anthony Edwards are also excellent in their smaller roles...
B000G0O5N2|4.0|This is a very good war movie.  There isnt much to compare it to.  The Somilia thing didnt produce many movies.  The movie stayed 80% true to the movie.

0316168815|5.0|I picked up The Lovely Bones in the LAX airport on my way to New York. I didn't begin reading it until I returned home. It took all of two days. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. Alice Sebold has hit upon the underlying questions we all have when we hear stories about people disappearing, seemingly falling off the face of the earth, without anything extraordinary in their disappearance. For a moment, we think how that could have been \\"me\\" or \\"my child\\" and then murmur our own \\"Thank God\\" because that tragedy somehow passed over us. Ms. Sebold very neatly unfolds the full story of Susie Salmon and her family. There is something so tidy about the way she tells the story that you can actually feel the suffocating effect of the family's grief and denial. One often reads about families breaking up when they are traumatized, and in this case Sebold reveals through her heavenly narrator, Susie, the breakdown of each member individually and collectively. Her treatment of the Mother, Ocean Eyes Abigail, was particulary beautiful. What seems heartless in Abigail was simply her way of dealing with her loss making it private and hidden. Then there is Sebold's interpretation of heaven that is quite fascinating. The idea that souls or one's personal energy surrounds those left behind is brilliant. Although fiction, it is comforting and disconcerting all the same. Can the dead truly watch us make love, grieve, and write in our journals? See what I mean? I highly recommend this book. It was so much more than I expected with a few twists and turns I didn't see coming.[[ASIN:0976519224 Waiting for Odysseus]]
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I can't remember the last time a movie made me want to bang my head against a wall. That's what I felt like doing when I got to the ending of this movie, perhaps the most absurd ending I've ever seen. It's a real shame. I've been reading everything I can about the Tudors (Anne especially) for about 10 years and of course, I read the book. While the book is very inaccurate and is pretty unfair to Anne, it's an overall enjoyable read. Despite the heavy material the book covered, there was still a light, fluffy, romantic feeling to it. The movie was shot dark and dreary, losing a great deal of the entertainment value of the book. There was ZERO character and romantic development in this film. The actors couldn't seem to decide whether or not to do English accents. The production felt comparable to a TV movie. I think the only thing anyone really worked on for this film was the costume design. I've seen lots of period pieces but these costumes were absolutely stunning. But the whole movie felt like it was slapped together. It just jumped from time period to time period leaving out major events and people. (WHERE'S WOLSEY???!!) It was even more inaccurate than the book. It was almost like the screenwriters just decided to rewrite history. Let me put it this way....I was actually thinking that Anne was going to survive and live happily ever after with Henry.
B0013V33DG|5.0|For singers, especially, this is a spectacular and exciting event.  Seen on the Giant Cinemark screen it was excellent, but scrutiny at one's leisure of the quality and talent of these two artists was breathtaking.  Actually, it wasn't just these two artists.  The Orchestra was spectacular with not a weak spot in the entire opera, crisp, clean execution, and magnificent musicality.  The support singers were also better than you can imagine.  I was unfamiliar with this opera until I saw this production, and can't for the life of me imagine anything more thrilling!  Staging and comedy were not forced, but naturally good humored and beautifully timed.  I bought this and have watched it several times.  It is one of the most inspiring performances I've ever scene.  You'll LOVE it!

0321146530|3.0|The book's scope is well-defined and its methodology (including a running \\"task list\\" that is updated at the end of each chapter with strikeouts and new items) is innovative. But it falls sadly short in execution.    The text is overloaded with cutesy digressions that only serve to obscure the topic at hand and irritate the reader. No \\"Head First\\" title, this. To read this book is to wish over and over that its author had had the humility to submit it to another editor's series rather than launching it under his own.    Still, there is no other book quite like it on this subject, and I can certainly recommend it for extended bookstore browsing. You may find you are less sensitive than me to Beck's assaults on clarity, in which case by all means go forth and buy.
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|This was lame!  Something lost from book to movie. I never read the book but watching the movie alone seemed like something was missing.  On the \\"extra stuff\\" on the DVD they admit that the plan to make a 3 part movie and the author of the book admits that it is far from the original idea of the book.  The special effects are great but the plot is unfinished and leaves you saying \\"WHAT? That's the ending!\\"  Not worth the money.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|There is a great feel of exploration throughout this album... a sense of breaking free. Sigur Ros tries so many things on this album that its hard to assign it an identity. Unlike, say, \\"Takk...\\" which I always summed up as being like the first rays of the morning sun, or a sudden flash of light.    To say that this is Sigur Ros' \\"White Album\\" might be a stretch, but each song here does seem to have its own identity. They each have features that can't be spotted in any of the other tunes. Whether it is the acoustic \\"Illgressi\\" or the escalating \\"Ara batur\\" or the extremely quiet \\"All Alright\\", you're getting a bag of variably colored marbles here.    The downside of this is that this album takes a while to really digest. It's hard to swallow so many styles in one package at first. I've been hearing this album for about 5 days and I still haven't quite been able to piece everything together.     But what counts here is that every track on the CD is either good, really good, or excellent. My favorite track here is \\"Godan daginn\\", which is probably the closest that any of the songs come to being definitive as far as the album goes.    As Sigur Ros has explored when recording this album, I am also exploring their creation. I find something new that I like about it every time that I listen to it. And that goes for the rest of their albums as well, and it's one of the reasons that they are one of my favorite bands.
B000UJ48VI|5.0|Brilliant 2 1/2 hours of character portrayal by Mason, Sellers, Winters and the lovely Lolita.<br />Kubrick's depiction of Freudian sexuality,murder,possesiveness,insecurity, a world without purpose but the maximization of one's pleasure within one's own private world shot and executed so carefully as to all detail makes this a remarkable tour De force.<br />This film adaption whether true to the original makes no difference since this movie is cast in the contemporary 1960's at a cusp of sociological change.<br />The drama is excellent and what comes to mind is Joan Crawford's Possessed and Edward G. Robinson's Scarlet Street but shot in the early 1960's with all themes intact.<br />The movies captures the tensions between the old and new extremely well,
0786168765|5.0|This book was fantastic.  I actually got it from the library first and dicided I needed to share it, so bought 2 books and a CD version to give as gifts.  The reader on the CD was so very clever with accents and voice control it was as if I was listening to a movie from a different room.  Both the writing and reading was so spot on and descriptive, I felt like I was in Bombay.  I will probably visit there one day.  GET IT!

0316024597|3.0|I have long been a fan of David Sedaris.  I've heard him on NPR, seen him at concerts and followed his career.  Although the stories in this book are wonderful and would normally be worthy of a five star review, I am rating this book three stars because I read some of these stories in prior collections.<br />I feel ripped off whenever this happens. Sedaris is getting extra money from his already loyal fan, when he could have supplied all new material for this publication.<br />Really bad form...
B0014I4KIK|5.0|It may be history repeating itself but it sure sounds good. Just as the first British Invasion made everyone appreciate rock'n'roll again,the Welsh warbler Duffy (and a few other female singers from across the pond) are reminding American listeners just how good soul music was before it was cast aside in favor of rap and hip-hop. This is not a case,however,of mere stylistic regurgitation,as in some retro artists like Lenny Kravitz.These songs stand on their own and offer a real breath of fresh air in a somewhat stale musical scene.Don't let the omnipresence of \\"Mercy\\" fool you into thinking you have heard all Duffy has to offer;that song is just the tip of the iceberg here.Buy the CD and I think you'll agree.

B000Q6GUW0|4.0|What I like most about this show is Dexter's efforts at (& confusion over) emotion.  Since he has none of his own, he is always observing and sometimes wondering why people do the things they do.  I feel like I can relate to that as I sometime wonder at the behavior of my fellow humans.  To be honest, I find that more intreresting than his weekly pursuit of justice.
0765348276|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Both the prose and characterizations are far above what you can normally expect from science fiction these days. Scalzi has imagined an interesting universe and there are a lot of intense action sequences balanced by thoughful, nuanced passages. The book also has a lot of clever, salty dialogue between the soldiers that is often quite funny.     This is the best science fiction book to come out since The Risen Empire/Killing of Worlds by Scott Westerfeld, in my opinion.
B000NDJOO2|3.0|This is one of those movies of which each of the ingredients makes your mouth water, yet the sum of the parts leaves a slightly flat taste.  First of all, lets say, this is a film worth watching, with an interesting message, great cinematography and terrific acting.  However, the decision to straddle two types of story weakens the stories impact, and the end result feels just a little too unfocussed to really work well.  The story follows 3 of the surviving men of the famous photo of raising the flag on Iwo Jima.  The photo becomes an iconic image of victory, and the government seizes the opportunity to use the survivors to tour the US exhorting the public to buy War Bonds.  To understand the film a little better, it is necessary to go in realizing that this is not a historical dramatization of the Battle of Iwo Jima in the traditional war movie sense, although scenes from that conflict are brutally realistically portrayed, in true post-Ryan terms.  It really only shows those war scenes as scattered flashbacks of the veterans as they are paraded around America to help sell the war.  In using the flashbacks to show the battle, we are being led to understand not what the moment of war itself is like, but how the memories of certain moments within a war can stay with you and haunt you, or in the case of Ira Hayes, drive you to drink.  It's a different way of looking at the horror of war than we usually get - however the effect of that is weakened by layering another level of flashbacks to the same events, viewed as the son of one of the men interviews his fathers friends to find out more about what happened to him.  It's an unnecessary complication which weakens the movie.  A second theme is the obvious one about the role of propaganda - how the act of allowing a lie to sell the truth becomes its own form of corruption.    And so, we go bouncing between these two central ideas as we see how the 3 survivors react differently to their new found `fame'.  The leads are allfine, and the cinematography as we have come to expect in an Eastwood movie is great - but the end result feels like it has just a little too much baggage to work efficiently - but flawed as it is, it is still worth a look.
0793518326|5.0|It is completley insane to criticize this great collection for the size of the print.

Bohm did not conduct the Ring in 1971 -- Horst Stein did, Windgassen was not singing in it in '71, the 67 was Wieland's production, the 71 was Wolfgang's. And on and on. Enjoy the CD's.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is by far the BEST movie that Pixar has ever made, hands-down.  If WALL-E is a 5-star movie, then all other Pixar movies are 4-star movies in comparison.  It is that magical.<br /><br />A big part of the magic comes from the fact that the two main characters, robots Wall-E and Eve, barely speak more than one word at a time.  Just about all their lines can be written with just one of these three words: \\"Wall-E,\\" \\"Eve,\\" and \\"Directive.\\"  Despite that, through excellent animation and wondrous voice direction, the audience is always aware of exactly what those two robots are thinking and feeling every second.<br /><br />Now, I love movies with good dialogue, and we all love witty banters between characters.  But by their very nature, language -- especially the witty sort -- requires intellectual interpretation before it can appeal to the audience's emotions.  By minimizing the role of language in portraying the relationship between the two robots, Pixar has gone straight to our emotions, and they have succeeded magnificently.<br /><br />Of course, that's not to say that the movie is only about sappy emotions.  The movie also makes a lot of satirical fun at everything from global corporation (everything is Buy n Large, and there is no sign of US government, or any government for that matter), environmentally irresponsible consumerism, cellphone- and television-addicted culture, lethargic and obese general public (and commercial billboards that portray fit models), internet generation who don't know what a book is (and think that pizza grows on trees), so on and so forth.  Plus, there is also a pretty refreshing gender role/stereotype reversal between Wall-E and Eve, especially near the end.<br /><br />Visually, the movie is breathtaking.  Particularly of note are the smoke and particle effects, like the scene early in the movie where Wall-E finds a fire extinguisher.  Jawdroppingly beautiful and realistic.  It makes you want to pull out all other movies with CG smoke effects and yell \\"FAKE!!\\" at them.  It's amazing how Pixar keeps on finding ways to push the 3D CG envelope.<br /><br />It is not often that a movie exceeds my highest of expectations, and WALL-E did with ease.  You can be sure that before the theatrical run is over, I'll be watching this movie at least one more time.  And then I'll get it when it's released on Bluray.  I do not say this often, but this movie is, without a shred of doubt, a true classic.hem.  It's amazing how Pixar keeps on finding ways to push the 3D CG envelope.

B00005JMJG|4.0|For English Lit majors and/or trivia wonks, the title of this film is taken from a line in Alexander Pope's \\"Eloisa to Abelard.\\"  Just as Eloisa prays to forget her tragic lover in Pope's poem, Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey) ask to have their memories of each other surgically removed from their minds in Mike Gondry's film.  However, during the neurological procedure to rid Joel of memories of his failed love, Joel begins to have second thoughts about letting go.  He begins to fight, albeit unsuccesfully, to hold onto his recollections of Clementine as the doctor systematically zaps away synaptic reminants of his girlfriend in Joel's brain.    Joel's struggle to hold onto these memories, which takes up a significant portion of the movie, further illuminates for the viewer a condition of human existence -- one that is often tethered not just to past experiences but our consciousness (i.e. memory) of that experience.  Despite an idea that could have easily slid into pedantic philosophical abstraction, the story ultimately works, because Gondry pulls the characters back into the real world. Clementine and Joel, despite their post surgical condition, are faced with a question that we must all face in life: whom do we fall for, regardless of what fate may have in store?

The tender love of a mother and her child.<br /><br />  When I gave this book to my mother for mothers day, she said, \\"You were never that much touble.\\"<br /><br />  I suppose if you took it literally you might think it strange, but I take this book as a symbol of un-ending love.<br /><br />  Jill Ammon Vanderwood<br />  [[ASIN:142591098X Through the Rug]]<br />  [[ASIN:0979845548 Through The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)]]
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Unbelievably great! I had an awesome time while watching this! It has intense suspense, and a \\"you are there\\" feel to it! There are some really good creepy-crawly parts, and there are some things that make you wonder what the heck-is-going-on, with a few unanswered questions that leaves you wondering! (Maybe answered in the sequel?) The effects are stunning! This one is a \\"must-see!\\"
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|Don't believe all the negative comments on this movie.  It was one of the greatest movies made. Their should be more like this type produced instead of all the dopey movies made with no plot that are being put out today.
0061148512|4.0|Reading The Bell Jar, I have uncomfortable moments where I see whispers of Esther's insanity in myself. Plath has created a character (or maybe recorded herself in a way) that is eminently believable, and begins the book with a personality that doesn't hint at what is to come later. Her apathy and distraction grow so gradually, normality and madness blend into each other so finely, that it is disconcertingly jarring to realize how hazy and meaningless the word \\"normal\\" really is. For some reason we seem to expect that we would know insanity instantly were we to see it, or experience it, ourselves. But of course the difference between a \\"normal\\" person and a person suffering from a mental disorder is a construct of our society, not an immutable distinction. This book is beautifully written, with many scenes that linger in my memory. It ends ambiguously, but the sad story of its author gives the entire work a somber feel.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Judas Priest jump into the time machine and make an album that probably would have been a five star breakthrough in....1983. Unfortunately, it's 25 years later, and the concept double album has seen better days, or even it's perfect moments (think [[ASIN:B000006TRV The Wall]]). Heck even Iced Earth, who swiped Halford replacement Ripper Owens, made a good one on [[ASIN:B0000YTOXA Glorious Burden]]. However, Priest are on their glorious third act since mounting [[ASIN:B0007MVXQG Angel of Retribution]]. \\"Nostradamus\\" is the saga they obviously wanted to make.<br /><br />More power to them. Instead of the 100'th re-write of \\"Breaking The Law\\" or \\"Living After Midnight,\\" the band stretches out on long winded passages like \\"Wind Of Change\\" or the mini-connectors between songs/chapters. If you're looking for \\"[[ASIN:B00005K9LK You've Got Another Thing Coming pt 5]]\\" it ain't coming. What you will get is Grand Guignol Theater, a 100 minute blast of mythology with plenty of KK Downing and Glenn Tipton's soaring twin lead guitars. In addition, the incomparable lead vocals of the Metal God himself whipping above it all.<br /><br />This is old school metal, fueled by demons and wizards and the mythology of Nostradamus. It teeters close to Spinal Tap on occasion (\\"Stonehenge\\" popped into my mind in a good way a few times), but that was what the best 70's and 80's was all about! It's the kind of Halloween scary that [[ASIN:B000002I99 Welcome to My Nightmare]] era Alice Cooper whipped out on a regular basis, just a couple decades behind its peak years. If you're OK with that (and in case you haven't guessed, I'm totally cool with it), Judas Priest's big bloated double CD packed to the brim with howling chariots of thud will have you painting your walls black in no time.
0553208845|3.0|Although I can understand the longing to separate oneself from the frustrations and hypocrisy of human life, it does seem like an abandonment rather than an accomplishment to me. Maybe because of this, and because I had been exposed to the tenets of both Buddhism and Hinduism prior to reading this novel, I didn't find it as life-altering and uplifting as many others find it. If you're new to eastern philosophy, this could be a good general introduction.

1400077915|3.0|Alice Munroe is widely lauded as one of the most brilliant modern short story writers. As a lover of short stories, I was expecting to really enjoy this collection. Certainly the stories are well-written and enjoyable to read. They are peopled largely with women, many of whom seem to exhibit a host of stereotypical feminine flaws (far too subservient or braggingly independent, ready to throw their lives away for randomly met men, etc). It isn't necessarily that the characters are not realistic; they seem real, but in such a way that I think I would despise or pity them if I met them out in the world. A few of the stories also employ thematic elements which struck a false note, at least with me (the main offenders - the mistaken identity of murdered adopted baby, a deaf-mute twin brother, sudden defection of a beloved child to a cult camp). That said, I did enjoy reading the stories, especially the title story (Runaway) and Passion. Worth reading, but I think I will reserve judgment concerning Monroe's status at the pinnacle of the craft.
0307277887|4.0|My day job happened to have a connection to the Dexter show - the sister of one of my coworkers worked on the set. My curiosity was already piqued by the premise of a serial killer turned vigilante, and I thought that as a show it would either be a marvelous achievement or a glorious disaster.  Since it was on Showtime, and I don't get Showtime, I didn't get the chance to find out.<br /><br />Eventually, Dexter came out on DVD and much to my relief the show was phenomenal.  Dexter is every bit as charming and cold-blooded as you might expect from a sympathetic psychopath, and his occasional narrative aside serves to add both humor and horror to the events on screen.  And those events are the political machinations of the Miami Police Department.<br /><br />Dexter was raised by his foster father and former cop, Harry, to follow a particular code. This code regulates everything Dexter does, from how he dresses to whom he kills.  Dexter's bloody murders are further complicated by his beard of a girlfriend, Rita, his half-sister Deborah, and his day job as a blood spatter analyst.  Then one day a serial killer starts committing murders with an underlying message, a message meant only for Dexter.  And then things get REALLY complicated...<br /><br />The show is surprisingly true to the book.  Every character is there just as I imagined them, except one: the main antagonist.  In the television series, Dexter's antithesis is smart, conniving, believable, and capable of far worse than Dexter himself.  In the book, he's a one-note ghoul who, in the span of five pages or so, expounds upon his entire background, his reason for killing and tempting Dexter, and their relationship.<br /><br />And therein lay the problem.  Darkly Dreaming Dexter tries to be both an ironic reflection of our fascination with serial killers and a murder mystery, but the mystery is severely lacking.  Lindsay can only come up with \\"maybe Dexter's committing the murders in his sleep.\\"  It's telling that the producers of the television series discarded that notion right away, choosing instead to introduce the villain gradually.<br /><br />The other problem is that the book escalates a conflict in Dexter's personal and professional life to such a level that it's something of a cheat; killing an antagonist off is easy, defeating them is hard.  The end of Darkly Dreaming Dexter doesn't even give us closure with the other serial killer.  He just gets away, leaving the reader with an unsatisfying conclusion and the creeping feeling that Dexter's personable façade has been completely discredited.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Dexter is a marvelous read.  As narrator, Dexter himself toys with language, using alliteration at it fancies him.  As an author, Lindsay's writing skills are above par, and some of his descriptions are almost poetic.<br /><br />Given the choice between the two though, I'll stick with television Dexter, thanks.sion series discarded that notion right away, choosing instead to introduce the villain gradually.

B00003CXB4|5.0|Lion King is a story that can be seen from many good perspectives.  It can also be alleged that it is not suitable for children, because of the violent scenes it contains. However, most of its content deals with the example of Mufaza to his son, example which lingers in his memory.  That alone is enough reason to rate the movie as excellent.  Besides, with a good review from the parents, this movie can leave much good in younger hearts about the realities of life. One of these is the sacrifice it involves to carry on anything that is of good report. All minds need direction, especially those of children. My advice is that parents, as they view certain scenes with their children, should make appropriate comments, so as to highlight the good in them.  The movie is, then, appropriate for all audiences.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is about a family trying to get the youngest daughter across country to compete in the \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" pageant. There's the dad (Greg Kinnear), who's a motivational speaker and author of a self-help book he's trying to sell; there's the gay uncle (Steve Carell), just out of the hospital after trying to kill himself; there's the teenage son (Paul Dano) who's taken a vow of silence; there's the grandfather (Alan Arkin) who's been kicked out of the retirement community; there's the daughter (Abigail Breslin) who's not quite like the other pageant contestants; and the mom (Toni Collette) who tries to hold them all together.    The trip tears them all apart and puts them back together, as a family.    If the characters were less quirky, the story would be too heartwarming for words, and would require a warning from dentists. But as it is, they're understandable and sympathetic in their quirkiness, and because they're exaggerated, it's easy to see parts of them in your own life, whether in yourself or those around you, making the movie very thought-provoking.    Little Miss Sunshine is described as a comedy, but I don't see that. There are funny parts, yes, but the story is too tragic to be a comedy, I think.
0525948023|2.0|I can see why this book is popular with the masses. In the age of instant everything Eckhard's promise that simply reading a book can be enough to engender the shift of consciousness he is talking about is appealing.    This book makes no acknowledgement of the existence of or even the differences between what can be termed vertical stages of consciousness and horizontal states of consciousness. It attempts to deal with consciousness as if the horizontal states are the only issue. And even in this attempt he oversimplifies the issue.     Now I realise that I am using jargon that may mean little to most of you so let me try and explain briefly what I mean. We all undergo vertical stages of development of consciousness. Numerous developmental psychologists, including the yogi's , have identified these and are in rough agreement with the stages and timing of their development. The \\"ego\\" stage that Eckhard rails against is one of these stages. Higher\\" stages of consciousness\\" relate to an increased cognitive capacity to deal with complexity in the world - they allow us to include more of the world and how it works into our constructed world view.     A stable \\"ego\\" is a pre-requisite for the stages of consciousness above ego stage. One does not attain these higher stages by \\"dissolving\\" or getting rid of the ego as Eckhard suggests. The ego remains and is transcended and included. These stages occur in a step wise fashion that cannot be circumvented. Each stage builds on the other and dependent on the life conditions of each person.    Horizontal states of consciousness - the primary subject of Eckhart's book - can occur at any stage of vertical stage of consciousness. In our normal waking state of consciousness we identify with our constantly changing thoughts and feelings as they arise in consciousness. When we dream or daydream we identify with those states of consciousness. When we are in deep sleep it seems like we have no consciousness that we are conscious of. Then there is another state of consciousness where we can, in a sense, stand back from what is going on mentally and emotionally and witness the whole process rather than identifying with it.     In a nutshell Eckhard is saying - if you read this book you will learn how to operate from a witnessing state and your consciousness will be transformed. Well good luck to you. If it were that simple and the benefits were as profound as Eckhard suggests we would all be doing it. The reason that so few people have achieved this in the past are a testament to this difficulty and this book does not acknowledge these difficulties or explain why they exist. And even if you do achieve this horizontal state of enlightenment you will still be at the same stage of vertical consciousness.    If you want to understand more of what I am talking about you could read Robert Kegan's - The evolving Self, The Never Ending Quest - Clare Graves, or Spiral Dynamics by Beck and Cowan. These are works of researchers. Ken Wilbur has taken these concepts and melded them into his recent work if you want to take a broad view that incorporates Buddhist and Vedantic/Yogic thinking.    Just as we don't expect babies to become fully functioning adults by giving them a book to read we should be wise enough not to expect that reading a book will transform consciousness in any meaningful way. This is Eckhards's promise - read this book and you will be transformed. It would be great if it were possible ......
B000063JZQ|5.0|Roman Polanski's screen adaptation of the Shakespeare classic was well received by some and loathed by others. On a personal level I thought the film was not only extremely well done but beautifully shot. Filmed on location in North Wales in England, Polanski not only researched his subject well but spared no cost in the production of the film. The actors costumes and the sets were lavish for its time and it provided a rich and colorful tone for the viewer. The tragedy of MACBETH, one of the Bard's greatest and toughest plays to understand and come to terms with fared remarkably well on this film version. As an English Literature major in college years ago, my professor required the we choose one of Shakespeare's plays and do a complete and thorough analysis on the work, I chose Macbeth and I found it not only challenging but quite difficult to understand the exact meaning of Shakespeare's beautiful old english language. It was a blessing that Polanski's film was available in the college library and I checked it out and saw the movie a couple of times before writing my paper on this complex character. I found the movie a lot easier to understand than the play itself and it helped me tremendously when I started to write my paper.    Although this version is quite bloody and shocking it doesn't diminish from the striking elegance and beauty that the film clearly shows. The movie has a bleak, dark and morbid feel to it and that is exactly as it should be I think. This is not a happy and sappy tearjerker or a comedy but a frightening, compelling, chilling and almost horror story of obsessive power, deceit and overbearing jealousy by Macbeth himself when he kills the King of Scotland so that he can take the crown and throne all for himself which is when his troubles begin and it consequences lead to his eventful downfall. I recommend this film adaptation not only to Literature majors but to everyone who has ever had a love of Shakespeare. The acting is splendid and the cast is first-rate and the language which Polanski adpated from the play makes it failry easy to follow and understand the plot and what each character says. That said this version of MACBETH is not for the faint of heart but then again the other versions of the play are not either. It was clearly to see that Shakespeare never intended for his Macbeth to be a subtle and forgiving character. The grotesqueness of the film is I believe an indispensable ingredient in understanding the complexity and darkened soul of this disturbing and unremorseful king. I recommend that you read the play before watching the movie just so that you have a general understanding of the plot and therefore will appreciate the film all that much more.
B000IU3XTW|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Foo Fighters. Sure, they are loud, most of the time that is. But hey, who in rock and roll can top Dave Grohl's marvelous sense of humor? Whenever I take a plane I think of the Foo's Learn To Fly video and start laughing as the crew prepares their usual take off procedures.  Everybody knows Dave Grohl as having been Nirvana's drummer. So it is to no surprise that people compare this semi acoustic live album to Nirvana's terrific Unplugged in New York.   But Dave isn't Curt - he doesn't want to be, doesn't need to. He's an amazing songwriter in his own right and the Foo Fighters are a terrific band.   In Your Honor, the album they brought out one year previous to this one, already had one disc with just acoustic songs. They were a truly amazing set of songs.   Here they play songs from all their previous albums showing that great songs can be played in a lot of different ways. They will forever be great songs.   But don't think of this as stripped down. It's perfect the way it is. Nothing is missing. It's just another take. That's what I expect when I go to a concert, to be surprised; not another album played live with every note as I already know it.  This set has 15 songs recorded in August 2006 live at Pantages Theater, Hollywood. A perfect recording with great mastering by ... Bob Ludwig (who else)   My favorites: Razor, Over and Out and Cold Day in the Sun  Apart from Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel and Chris Shiflett, you'll find Petra Haden on violin, mandolin and vocals, Drew Hester, percussion and vibes, Rami Jaffee, piano, mellotron, accordion and organ, Pat Smear, acoustic and electrical guitar, Danny Clinch, harmonica.
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins has incisively separated fact from fiction (i.e. god) in making a case that an omniscient God is very unlikely to exist and is not the source of all that is good. See the youtube presentation by Dawkins in Lynchburg VA for more information if you are interested.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Great cd, MUCH better than their last effort.  Their first cd is one of my favorites of all-time, The Sound of Madness will rival Leave a Whisper.  Hated to find out the original lineup changed, but the music speaks for itself.
B000UD08HW|5.0|I am mainly a fan of the older songs, but the atmosphere in the concert more than makes up for the unknown songs.  Beautiful and makes you remember old times.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|I watched this movie in the 1980's, and loved it. The soundtrack from Footloose and Flash Dance were part of my workout routine at the time. (When I was thinner, and more fit.)<br /><br />The story itself is perhaps a bit improbable. Imagine, a town banning dancing and rock 'n roll music?! Oh, but wait, remember how so many people in the 1950's warned against the evils of Rock 'n Roll? Maybe this story isn't so offbase.<br /><br />This movie is really a story of adolescents struggling to find themselves, struggling with the good and bad, and finding a good way to express themselves.<br /><br />I identified with Ren McCormick very easily. My adolescence was a struggle to express my identity. Unlike \\"the hero,\\" my struggle was not quite so successful. Through this movie, I can enjoy a successful struggle, vicariously.<br /><br />Over the years, I've played the CD of the soundtrack so many times that it wore out. I need to buy another CD.<br /><br />I recently purchased the Special Collector's Edition of the movie... and it still touched me, after all these years.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I saw the promos with Brandon Routh, and didn't think he'd make a good Superman. I was wrong.<br /><br />Brandon Routh made a great Superman and Clark Kent. I loved the way so many people seem to ignore Clark, or push him around. This makes the contrast between Clark and Superman more believable. You actually can see why some people wouldn't see the resemblance..<br /><br />The story was interesting, to see Superman return after an absence of 5 years.. and see that the world survived without him. Indeed, they don't need him.<br /><br />Lois has moved on, is engaged, and has a son... Hmm, do you wonder who the father really is? You see a few hints in the movie.<br /><br />It's interesting to see how three people handle a present and past relationship. I was rather pleased to see Lois apparently sticking with her fiance. It was also good to see Lois & her fiance take an active part in helping to save Superman from near certain death.<br /><br />That was another good aspect of this movie. We get to see the power of Superman, along with his vulnerability. Indeed, he almost dies at least twice.<br /><br />I liked the choice of Kevin Spacey for Luthor.. He almost reminds me of when Gene Hackman played the role. Kate Bosworth made a good Lois, in my opinion.<br /><br />This movie goes well with the first two Christoper Reeves Superman movies. (Let's forget about the rest of them.)
B000HCO840|5.0|This movie had a lot of everything, and I loved it. I hope it's not really their Last Stand.<br /><br />Briefly, we dealt with Death and Resurrection, concerning Jean Grey (Phoenix), Cyclops & Professor X.<br /><br />We see some early insights into the power of Jean Grey. We see more insights into the romantic tensions between Jean Grey and Wolverine.<br /><br />A good element of the story is the invention of a \\"cure\\" for the mutants. They will allegedly be allowed to choose whether or not they want the cure. But you just have to know the government is likely to take that choice away.<br /><br />Magneto gathers his Evil Mutants to fight the \\"normal\\" people who have created the cure. This involves moving the Golden Gate bridge to allow them to move to Alcatraz Island.<br /><br />Some of my favorite X-men return in this movie, and many new ones are introduced. One of my favorites is Kelsey Grammar (Frazer) as the Beast. It is such a great match.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is the abundance of characters, in the X-men and the Evil Mutants. So many characters get only a few moments to shine.<br /><br />Again, I think this is a result of a valiant effort to cover the wide range of characters and changes over the past 40+ years of the X-men's history.<br /><br />My biggest regret was that I didn't see this in a theater... I lost some of the dramatic impact, and missed the audience reaction.<br /><br />But I can save the DVDs for a long time.
B000066AXE|5.0|I resisted this movie for awhile. I tend to rebel against anything or anyone who appears to be over-hyped. I got tired of hearing about Russell Crowe. Finally I broke down and bought the movie.<br /><br />In a way, this is two stories in one. The beginning story is totally engrossing and believable. You watch this beautiful mind, this talented man emerge into his field, gather followers, find love, and get an intriguing, dangerous job. Then you learn The Truth.<br /><br />The remainder of the story depicts a man's struggle against his \\"emotional illness,\\" eventually without the use of drugs (because they diminished his Beautiful Mind, his brilliance).. His struggles to hold onto his beloved wife and family.. and his eventual story of humble triumph.<br /><br />This was a great movie, and made me a Russell Crowe Fan.
B0000B3B95|1.0|The Incredible Hulk has been one of my favorite Marvel Super Heros, since the 1960's.<br /><br />Yes, I lost track of him over the past few decades when I gave up comics in favor of computers. But I still love the character I remember.<br /><br />I even liked the Incredible Hulk TV show of the 1980's. Hulk wasn't as powerful as he was in the comics, but he was more believable. Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno helped tremendously in that regard.<br /><br />But this movie stank like rotten eggs on a warm July day.<br /><br />The story turned into some weird story of father and son, and their inner battles, or something like that.<br /><br />In all my years of following the Hulk, I don't recall ever reading anything about Bruce Banner's father or mother. I surely don't recall this crappy storyline.<br /><br />If you haven't yet seen this movie, rent it, don't buy it.<br /><br />I'm so glad The Incredible Hulk has gotten another chance with the new movie released in 2008.<br /><br />I haven't seen it yet, in the theaters. I'll probably buy the DVD.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Daredevil has been in the Marvel Comics Universe since 1964. In that time, he's gone through many changes. (The same can be said for just about any comic super hero.)<br /><br />It's a great challenge to create a Super Hero movie. The movie must appeal to a wide range of viewers, ranging from those of us who were there in the beginning, to those who've seen the comics in the decades since, and those who've never read the comics.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best super hero movies honor the comic book image of the character. Again, that's not easy if the character has changed over several decades.<br /><br />When I heard about this movie, I was skeptical.<br /><br />Ben Affleck as Daredevil?! Isn't he too thin?! (I remember the Johnny Romita version of Daredevil.)<br /><br />The entire cast was well-chosen. Ben Affleck & Jennifer Garner were great together as Daredevil and Elektra. Michael Clarke Duncan was great as Kingpin, and Colin Ferrell was great as Bullseye.<br /><br />I loved the movie, and so did my ex-wife... She was never a comics fan.. so that is a great recommendation!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I admit it, I'm a Baby Boomer, and have been a Spider-Man fan since he was first introduced in the 1960's.<br /><br />I confess that, like so many others growing up, I put aside comics, reluctantly, in the 1980's. Ok, so I hung onto comics till I was in my 30's.<br /><br />In the decades since, I've missed many Spider-Man stories, and many changes in Peter Parker and the Spider-Man.<br /><br />I was familiar with Green Goblin & Sandman, but not with Eddie Brock. I read something about Venom, but don't remember much.<br /><br />The recent Spider-Man movies have done a great job of portraying a very interesting super hero in the Marvel style.<br /><br />Peter Parker has finally united with Mary Jane. But he still lives in the crappy little apartment with a door that only Peter can handle. Peter is still struggling to earn a living, and Eddie Brock is there to challenge his limited progress.<br /><br />Then Spidey finds the black suit, and sees a more powerful, darker side of himself. The lives of Peter Parker and Spider-Man are threatened, as is Peter's relationship with Mary Jane.<br /><br />The movie's portrayal of the new Peter Parker is rather silly in so many ways. The silliest part is Peter's song and dance routine. But then a little comedy is good for a super hero comic or movie.<br /><br />The Venom story by itself was a challenge for a movie, but add the Sandman and the new Green Goblin... I was surprised that Spider-Man would survive.<br /><br />But then there was a certain twist of fate, or surprise alliance, wasn't there?<br /><br />Watch the movie and see.<br /><br />This is another excellent addition to my collection.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I bought this movie because I loved watching Hugh Jackman in the X-Men movie. I'm also a horror movie fan.<br /><br />This was an excellent, frightening, fast-paced movie. The special effects were fantastic.<br /><br />The extras were well-appreciated: a tour of Dracula's castle, the Legend of Van Helsing, Bringing the Monsters to life.<br /><br />I'm an amateur graphic artist, so I appreciate such insights into how such effects were created.<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to anyone with similar tastes to mine.
B000002OX5|4.0|For me this is The Who's first really good album.  They would go on to achieve even bigger things, but \\"Sell Out\\" shows a glimpse of the potential that was to come.  The album revolves around the concept of a pirate radio station complete with commercials (written and performed by The Who).  It is a really clever concept especially for 1967.  The album produced a classic Who hit in \\"I Can See For Miles\\" which to this day is the band's only top 10 hit in the U.S.  The album was ahead of it's time in many ways and includes the mini conceptual piece \\"Rael\\" which would serve as a springboard into their classic album \\"Tommy\\".  Today this album sounds very much a product of it's time, but the remastering is very well done and is chock full of 10 bonus tracks.  The Who went on to do several albums that I consider to be all time rock classics, but this one is where it all started.
1416955070|5.0|I felt it was unfortunate to see some of the poor reviews this book was recently given. I teach seventh grade English and enjoy reading YA literature for my own enjoyment. I actually picked up this novel when I was at a local store, and the cover of \\"City of Ashes\\" caught my eye. After reading a short blip about the first book, I figured I better pick it up. It took several weeks for me to get the book because they couldn't keep them on the shelves here. I read this book in one day, and then ran out and bought the second book, which I also read in one day...couldn't put them down! The only other book I have enjoyed to that extent was \\"Twilight.\\" If you enjoy books that are a little on the darker side, I would tell you to pick this one up!
B000GB775E|2.0|The technical aspects of this movie are OK, and of course New York city looks bright and inviting.  Success and failure are measured by the size of apartments and the ability to date rich guys or hot (pretty stupid) girls.  The film is simply dumb, to the point where you cannot ignore this quality even when watching in zombie mode.  Also, it tries to sell a light-pop British boy-band with too much fury.  Like a movie from the Disney Channel.  What more?, ah, Lindsey Lohan is extremely beautiful, all the time, and the deleted scenes are good and should have been included in the movie.  That's it.
B0012Q732O|4.0|Historical inaccuracies aside, I thought this was a good movie!  I enjoyed the love story, the travels and scenery, and the acting.  I had put off seeing it because of the bad reviews, and I am sorry that I waited so long.  Keeping in mind the movie is fiction, watch it and enjoy!
B00005JKC3|4.0|I suppose, had I watched this DVD thinking I was going to view the typical American action flick I would have been disappointed.  I was told by everyone I know who saw it that I would hate it (I love action flicks).  I'm glad I didn't listen, I would have missed a near masterpiece. Not an action masterpiece but definitely a film masterpiece.<br /><br />This film definitely isn't packed with the action of most Marvel films, instead it is more like an actual comic book and it would be hard for me to believe a true comic book fan could have missed this.  Aside from the shots and editing that truly make it look as if we were watching a comic book come to life, the story line is just about the same tempo.  The good guys and bad guys are pretty straight forward and the whole thing comes together nicely enough to propose a good sequel.<br /><br />In most comic books, while the character development isn't on par with a Jane Austen novel, we do get to know the heroes well enough to like the good guys and the evil doers well enough to be glad when they \\"bite the dust.\\"  In Hulk this was done very well, in traditional comic book style, unlike so many of the other Marvel movies.<br /><br />I wish more people would have seen this film for the work it was instead of just wanting more of the same smash 'em up, blast 'em up we usually get in the comic book film genre.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I will start by saying that this is a romanticized and fictionalized \\"biographical\\" movie of the life of Beatrix Potter, creator of Peter Rabbit. But however true or not true it is to her life story, it is still an excellent movie based on the culture of the end of the Victorian age. There is an amazing and real feeling of the repression of the age, where even taking a lady's hand was fraught with meaning. Both Ewan and Renee manage to portray the growing attraction between them with just a lowered eye, a slight smile, a flush of color, and a lingering glance. And the supporting cast, including Emily Watson, make this an eminently watchable movie.<br /><br />If you are a fan of movies such as \\"Finding Neverland\\", \\"Room with a View\\", and \\"Gosford Park\\" where the culture and manners are as much a character as the humans, I think you will like \\"Miss Potter\\".
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I'm a 36 year old metalhead, and I pretty much know my stuff to the tune of some 4000 songs on my Ipod spanning 40+ years. I have always respected Priest and enjoy their well-known songs but I was never a hardcore fan, nor did I hate the band. Having said that, I started listening to Nostradamus with expectations of a straight-forward metal record with a few good tracks. I was immediately blown away track after track until the end of disc 2, and that's no small feat for me who's known for being a bit on the choosy side. It's amazing that Rob Halford and company not only made a brilliant concept album, but they blended prog and metal seamlessly and with amazing confidence. There is a lot of heart in the making of this album, and boy does it deliver in spades. The musicianship is balls to the wall and experimental wrapped with vocals that sound more youthful than most of what's out today. This is a great accomplishment for Priest, and this new direction has won my admiration and my fandom.<br />....And to the few low I.Q. morons who have ignorantly panned this record please be aware the new Hanna Montana record will be out soon since that's more their speed. Don't hurt yourselves trying to figure out all of the two-syllable words in this review either!

B0013J30XG|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. I loved the speed racer series as i was growing up and this is even better! The car action in this will keep you on the edge of your seat and you actually start to believe the characters in it and sympothise with them. However the reason I gave it 4.5 stars and not 5 is for two reasons:  1. The beginning is pretty slow. Once it gets into it its very fast paced and edge of your seat though. and,  2. The fight scenes are kinda a joke. When you see these fight scenes from the creaters of The Matrix you wonder what went wrong. But they completely make up for it with the car battles.    This movie is worth seeing. I'm glad i went and saw it.
B00005JL0I|2.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" is one of those films, ala \\"Cleopatra\\" and \\"Heaven's Gate,\\" whose backstory is more interesting than anything that made it to the screen.<br /><br />Before Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli came calling on Ian Fleming in 1961 to propose the deal that would give birth to the James Bond film series that continues today, the author sold his first 007 novel, \\"Casino Royale,\\" to CBS-TV. After the network adapted the book for a 1954 episode of \\"Climax,\\" the film rights passed to Gregory Ratoff. Once the Saltzman-Broccoli films gathered box-office momentum, producer Charles K. Feldman, a former associate of Broccoli's, bought the rights from Ratoff's widow in the hope of cashing in on his friend's success. So much for loyalty. Believing he could not compete directly with the \\"official\\" Bond films, Feldman turned \\"Casino Royale\\" into a spoof. \\"Bondmania\\" which reached its peak with the 1965 release of \\"Thunderball\\" was winding down by then, but \\"Casino Royale\\" sold enough tickets to become the third biggest box-office hit of 1967 (\\"You Only Live Twice,\\" that year's real Bond film, took second place behind \\"The Dirty Dozen\\"). But the bloated budget meant it could never qualify as a success.<br /><br />The screenplay, to which \\"Catch 22\\" author Joseph Heller, Terry Southern, and Billy Wilder are said to have made contributions, shows signs of too many chefs at work in the kitchen, which was clearly the case behind the camera. No less than five directors are credited, so it's not surprising that the film has no real direction. It's a mess. But, hey, this was the `60s, baby, an era of \\"doin' your own thing,\\" transcendental meditation, surrealism in music (\\"I am the walrus, goo-goo-gagoob\\"), so there was no need to be coherent.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" has more in common with Feldman's earlier \\"What's New, Pussycat?\\" than it does with James Bond. Both films co-starred Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, and Woody Allen, and surrounded them with other stars, though \\"Casino Royale\\" has the more glittering lineup with even the likes of Deborah Kerr, William Holden, and Orson Welles joining in. Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between with Allen providing the most amusing moments. Burt Bacharach's music score is a classic, however, highlighted by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass' performance of the title tune.<br /><br />The 1954 television version of Ian Fleming's first 007 novel is included on the DVD. The live telecast survives today on kinescope, a crude pre-video technique in which the program was filmed directly off a monitor as it was transmitted into the viewers' homes. The production itself is a little crude, too, but it remains watchable.<br /><br />James Bond is an American agent in this version, and star Barry Nelson portrays him less enigmatically than any of the actors who followed in the role. One thing this Bond is not is larger than life. \\"I'm no hero,\\" he says after being roughed up by his foes, \\"I don't like pain.\\" This certainly isn't the more nonchalant Bond of the big screen, but it is a convincing one. Peter Lorre makes an effective LeChiffre, Bond's first adversary, and Linda Christian is good, too. This production isn't entirely faithful to the novel, but considering the time constraints, that couldn't be expected.<br /><br />Brian W.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|I love the show also. BUT JUST LIKE THE ONE WHO REVIEWED IT BEFORE ME. IT'S DEFECTIVE. Disc 1 & 6 doesn't have what's listed on the jacket. I have the second one here & it's defective also. So now have to send this 2nd one back also. Amazon needs to do better. This is the 2nd or third time I've dealt with Amazon & have had trouble all three times.
0316143472|5.0|Lovely monograph with plenty of images of P & G best work. Great price and totally worth the money. Also my book came slightly damaged but Amazon immediately sent out a replacement. Awesome customer service I am really pleased.
0385340567|5.0|I read a lot of mystery and thriller fiction. Child never disappoints, and Nothing to Lose is no exception.<br /><br />The bar fight was one of the best action scenes I've read in years, the pace was tight, the story compelling, and the supporting characters realistic and memorable. Reacher kicks a decent amount of butt, and the mystery element is deeper than in Child's previous novels. Also, there's an explosive twist ending.<br /><br />Is this a political book, laced with left-wing rhetoric? Hell no. It's a fact-paced thriller. It doesn't preach. It entertains.<br /><br />Reacher isn't political. He's a classic western hero. He rides into town, fixes the problem, then rides on. He never acts on any sort of political or personal agenda. He simply studies a situation, finds the cause, and deals with it.<br /><br />I read Nothing to Lose in one sitting and enjoyed every page. If you're a fan of Child, or of just damn good reads, you'll enjoy this too.
1582701709|4.0|I have very mixed feelings about The Secret. I think this book can be an amazing catalyst for change and growth for certain people. I also think it can spell huge disaster for others.<br /><br />Let's get the bad out of the way first. The book uses quotes from many famous people throughout history to say that if you want something - just BELIEVE you have it with all your heart and you will get it. Don't \\"want\\" it or dream about someday having it - instead, believe with every fiber of your being that it already is yours. If you want to go on a cruise, act as if you already have the tickets. Don't go around saying \\"I can't afford that\\" - believe in your heart that you can afford it.<br /><br />I think most of us can see the problem here. If you have an instant gratification personality, you will easily believe these things - and go max out your credit card. You will honestly believe you CAN afford these things, that you WILL have money soon to cover all your bills, then bankrupt yourself and destroy your life. I know people who have done that.<br /><br />Rhonda applies the Secret to health and weather too. So if you simply believe your cancer is going away, it will. I am ALL for positive attitude (and I'll get into that later) but what if your chosen belief is \\"I will beat this cancer completely naturally, without medicine\\"? We have seen in the news families who believed 100% with all their heart that God would heal them - and the child died. Someone who believes with all their heart \\"My ex will come back to me!\\" might waste their life away - bypassing wonderful men - because of that incorrect belief.<br /><br />So yes, this book can certainly be mis-used by people who do not apply its words wisely. But you could probably say that about anything. People out there lose lots of weight on low carb diets - and then some people think it means \\"eat only steak and nothing else\\" and do poorly. Any system can be followed properly or badly.<br /><br />What is the GOOD about this book? There is a lot of good in here. Many of the basics of other books and religions are covered. To summarize - start with a quiet mind, meditation and calmness to think about what you want. \\"You must feel good about You. This is important.\\" Really focus on what you have now and honestly enjoy it - feel gratitude for the good things already in your life. Focus on positive goals - instead of thinking \\"I have to get out of this debt\\" focus on \\"I will be financially stable.\\" Help out others around you - not as a \\"sacrifice\\" of your time and money, but because you honestly enjoy doing it. Learn to enjoy your own company, to be happy with who you are. Only you can make yourself happy - not others, not possessions. As for the past, \\"Let it all go no matter what it is. Do it for you.\\"<br /><br />You might think some of these things are cliche, but they are all SO true. There's a reason the concepts show up in book after book. They are critical to long term contentment. Maybe it takes some people 4 or 5 readings before it starts to sink in. If that's the case, The Secret does its job to help keep emphasizing these points.<br /><br />To remind people that this wisdom is ancient, Rhonda adds in quotes from many well known personalities.<br /><br />\\"Whether you think you can or think you can't, either way you are right.\\" -- Henry Ford.<br /><br />\\"All that we are is a result of what we have thought.\\" -- Buddha<br /><br />Rhonda talks about the placebo effect - something we all know about. In studies, lots of people react just as well to a sugar pill as they do to real medicine! They believe so strongly that they are going to get better that they really do. Our bodies are rather powerful healing machines. If we honestly believe a bracelet will reduce our stress, we will begin to relax - and our stress really will lessen!<br /><br />So I do believe wholeheartedly in the underlying message of this book. It is important to appreciate what you have in life, and to find contentment in it before you start reaching for your goals. It is important to have goals, and to focus and strive towards them with healthy energy. Rather than being jealous of others, realize how many others don't have what you do now. Rather than live your life full of stress  - which causes numerous health problems - find a way to lead it as relaxed and content as you can.<br /><br />The Chicken Soup author explains succinctly how this all helps. When he first wrote his book, he was stuck on what to do with it - and he was extremely poor. But he made it his focus to get the book to sell. Once he was focused, he started noticing things around him that he might otherwise have not paid attention to. Because he was actively thinking all the time about selling the book, and talking about it, he was able to make contacts and arrangements and the book became a top seller. If instead he had just sat in his house, watching TV, never thinking about his book, it's unlikely it would have gone anywhere.<br /><br />This brings up one of my concerns again. Much of the book talks about the process \\"working itself\\" without ANY input from you. The book talks about simply \\"placing an order\\" with the Universe and then waiting for it to happen. That reminds me of the Joplin song \\"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedez Benz? My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends!\\" There's also the classic joke of a devout parishioner who prays every day to win the lottery. Finally God's voice booms out, saying \\"buy a lottery ticket!!\\"<br /><br />Now, I realize WHY Rhonda wrote it this way. People really do honestly need to believe their goal is achievable. If they get stressed out and wound up in the \\"How\\"s, they might never start. They just need to believe they WILL get a better job and then start working on the task every day. They can figure it out as they go. There are one or two SMALL comments in the book about \\"Inspired action will not feel like work at all\\". The point is when you're working towards a goal you honestly love and adore, anything you do towards that path will be thrilling. Sort of like working in a Broadway Theater as an understudy - this might be a fantastically amazing experience for someone who has always dreamed of being a Broadway star. Yes, they are \\"just\\" an understudy and not the star, but this is a step on the path and inherently fantastic in and of itself.<br /><br />So I agree with her that getting people to focus on their goal is a good thing. I wish there had been more caveats of \\"you need to work on it every day, not just lounge on your couch watching TV and eating bon-bons and waiting for the world to give you millions\\". But I also understand that many people have to start slowly. They have to even acknowledge that there is a chance for them, to have the ability to dream. The Secret gets them started.<br /><br />This brings me to another point. Nowhere in The Secret does she talk at all about priorities. Deciding your priorities is SO important before you start heading towards goals. What if your goal is a big house - when really what you want is a happy family? What if you get that big house and now you never see your family members because they're all off in a different part of the house, and you're sad and miserable? Goals should *always* spring from core priorities in your life. The book almost drives home a message of \\"be a millionaire with a mansion and a yacht! Grab grab grab!\\" That concerns me a lot. Again, maybe if she \\"cluttered\\" up the message with priorities and planning a lot of people would think it was too much work and not bother. But I really wish she had a chapter on healthy priorities, all the same.<br /><br />So The Secret should be taken in conjunction with other books that DO go into priority setting and non-complaining, to help provide the tools to achieve your dreams. I do think The Secret is a valuable part of that library, though. Its core message is straightforward and completely true. Wake up eachmorning feeling grateful for what you have, and positive about your opportunities for the day. Help out others around you, and focus on your goals. Feel good about yourself. Instead of complaining about your past and problems, be enthusiastic about your dreams and future.

B00003CXA6|5.0|Being an active professor, a war film collector, and a twenty-five-year military veteran, I sometimes tend to be overly-critical of war films, mostly in terms of historical accuracy and \\"situational believability.\\"  The pains the producers took make this both an enjoyable film yet as historically accurate as they could are especially noteworthy.<br /><br />Numerous other reviewers have accomplished excellent detailed descriptions of the unfolding events that evolved into the Battle of Gettysburg, as described in the film, so I will limit my comments to those that I believe will focus on overall quality.<br /><br />The film accurately presents the evolution of events that slowly build into one of history's most important battles, one that neither side really wanted to fight on this site, despite the fact that it proved to be \\"good ground\\" for such a massive engagement.  One aspect of this \\"crescendo approach\\" that I most appreciated was the presentation of many views of the characters and personalities of the military figures from both sides of the conflict.<br /><br />One of the most important revelations was the fact that General Robert E. Lee was not the strategically infallible figure that many historians portray, and that certain decisions he made, despite the opposition of his excellent corps and division commanders, ultimately turned the battle in the Union's favor.  The film also subtly presented the effect on the battle's strategy and outcome of the untimely death of General Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, as presented in \\"Gods and Generals.\\"<br /><br />When I first saw the listings on the cast of this film, I was taken aback, since I had mentally stereotyped some actors' in previous roles that would not seem to be a \\"fit\\" for their roles in this film.  However, Martin Sheen did a fine job as Robert E. Lee, Tom Berenger was superb as General Longstreet, Stephen Lang excelled as General Pickett, and so on.  The greatest surprise was the performance of Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, whose performance is followed here and further expanded upon in \\"Gods and Generals,\\"  \\"Gettysburg's\\" prequel.  This film, and his performance in \\"The Crossing\\" clearly showed what a fine and versatile actor Daniels is.<br /><br />It would be redundant to describe some of the most fantastic battle scenes ever filmed, as this has been well-covered by other reviewers.  \\"Utterly fantastic\\" about covers it, in terms of realism and a \\"spare no expense\\" attitude on the parts of the producers who desired historical accuracy in the making of the film.<br /><br />I seriously cannot imagine any collector who would not place this film near the top of most valued films of all time.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|It seems like Peter Parker has taken a step back in personality and maturity than he finally arrived at in Spidy 1.  There's just so many screwball ideas in this Spidy that the movie would go between mega CGI action to a near stop with a couple sappy soap like back stories.  I wount point out all the disappointments, but there is a couple worth mentioning.    The alter ego Peter Parker was several degrees below being the nerd he usuall plays.  He was a down right creep show strutting and dancing down the street, but the real gem is when they had women look at him like he was a cool stud when doing that.....Ya right.     Another beef of mine is that if you're going to make a movie after a comic book, then at least keep the powers somewhat comparable.  I haven't read a Spiderman for quite a while, but I don't remember him having a super strong body that can drop several stories and not be effected.  Or take a sever beating by a super bad guy and not end up looking like road kill....He's Spiderman....Not Superman....
B0018AK9RA|2.0|The best tracks on the album are the singles that have been released. The album has the same feel as \\"Eulogy\\" and \\"Loch Ness\\" (which seems like Priest's Spinal Tap moment with its cheesy lyrics and plodding drudgery) off of Angel of Retribution. The album is well produced, but feels as though they tried to make a technically impressive piece that simply has no feeling or energy, and thus comes off feeling contrived and forced. This seems most apparent in Halford's vocals, which sound as uninspired as if he was bored and simply wanted to knock out his tracks to get out of the studio. The atmospheric pieces between each actual song also seem to detract more from the project than add to it. If you are looking for Priest, its not here. If you are looking for a metal concept album done well; it isn't here either, instead look to Ayreon, Kamelot, Stratovarius, Gamma Ray, or Iron Savior.
B000LAZDQA|3.0|I have to say this film was erotically stimulating but I am unclear as to the various story lines what the characters were trying to achieve.

B000UAE7RW|4.0|It's surprising that for all the slavish attention to period detail that Roman Polanski puts into CHINATOWN, he lets down the audience in the finale which is supposed to take place in the actual Chinatown at night. Instead, it looks (as the original review in The New York Times pointed out), more like Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn with a few neon signs flickering in the background for Oriental flavor, filmed on an artificial, improvised set. It's a letdown when the film's most crucial moments aren't given the careful period flavor that goes into the majority of the piece. It's also unworthy of the film's final line: \\"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.\\"<br /><br />Robert Towne's screenplay owes a great deal to Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, both expert writers of crime detective fiction full of sardonic humor and double entendre remarks, usually delivered in deadpan manner by whomever was playing the male detective. He uses \\"Chinatown\\" as a metaphor for a puzzle nobody can solve, sort of the way Thomas Mitchell summed up a mystery by saying \\"makes as much sense as Chinese music\\" in \\"The Dark Mirror.\\"<br /><br />In both CHINATOWN and THE MALTESE FALCON, a private eye gets involved in a messy case involving murder and other assorted mayhem, drawn into the case by a cool femme fatale who knows more than she's saying, and a cast of mostly unsavory characters living in the fringes of L.A.'s Chinatown area where crime in the 1930s is rampant.<br /><br />In this case, the cynical, hard-nosed detective is played to perfection by JACK NICHOLSON in the kind of role he excelled in, justly winning a Best Actor nomination. And likewise, the inscrutable dame is played by FAYE DUNAWAY in the sort of part Mary Astor essayed in \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\" Instead of Sydney Greenstreet, we get JOHN HUSTON in the role of her megalomaniac, corrupt father. And keeping all of this fascinating material well in hand is Roman Polanski, himself a player in the film as the hood who slashes Nicholson's nose.<br /><br />It's gritty, authentic looking (except for the above-mentioned flaw) and captures the mood of the story with its Los Angeles backgrounds and detailed attention to '30s styles. Visually, it's a masterpiece--and while the story gets a little slow once in awhile in uncovering a convoluted plot involving land rights and water control, it leads to a highly suspenseful ending.<br /><br />A stylish thriller, well worth watching, especially if you love film noir. But somehow, Bogie's image hovers over most of the dialog and it falls far short of being called a \\"masterpiece\\" as many have done here. A more concise, compact telling of the tale would have made that description more apt instead of this long, rambling story with its engineering background and slow revelations.<br /><br />Note: The widescreen DVD features a couple of insightful commentaries by the creators of \\"Chinatown\\" (Roman Polanski, Robert Towne, Bob Evans), as well as Jack Nicholson, but it's advisable to watch after seeing the film because a lot of the plot twists are given away.tty, authentic looking (except for the above-mentioned flaw) and captures the mood of the story with its Los Angeles backgrounds and detailed attention to '30s styles.

Although we eagerly awaited this year's publication, both of us felt Nothing to Lose was not up to Child's usual standards. The main weaknesses include too many plot lines wandering in too many directions, a villain who wasn't particularly villainous, and a basic underlying story concept that really isn't that interesting. A couple of really annoying  elements include a town named Despair: I can not suspend my disbelief long enough to accept such an idea. And don't get me started on the scene in which the townspeople rise up like residents of Village of the Damned. Let's hope Reacher regains some of his earlier power in the next book.

It vastly improves recycle times, doesn't cost a fortune, and is relatively light weight.  This is the answer for those of us who need more power from the flash but don't want to spend the money on turbo batteries. It is good to have at least 2 chargers for your recyclable AA's since you will be using eight in here and another four in the flash.

These cupcakes are very easy and taste wonderful. You would never know there is no egg or dairy. I have tried the vanilla, chocolate, and peanut butter ones. The peanut butter cupcakes were the best ones I have ever had, vegan or not. I highly recommend this book.
0061537934|3.0|Well, Art of Racing is a sweet enough book, and I'd have to say the description of \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" as a dog frankly nails it. I appreciated the idiosyncratic first-person-dog narrator, starting out strong revealing the saga as much through scent observation as otherwise.   Enzo is sweetly and dearly rendered throughout his life.       It was entertaining to venture into the world of auto racing, unknown terrain to me, and I feel as though more details to immerse me in the subculture would have been enjoyable.    What makes the read less than memorable is the limited character development.  Denny is essentially a perfect human being.  Call my cynical, but I appreciate a little more of the human condition.  Alright for Enzo to think him divine, but the reader should be given more a sense of a whole man.  As golden as Denny is, the \\"Evil Twins\\" (a/k/a the in-laws) are despicable beyond belief without better exposition on why they would be so callous.  The explanations given by the author feel trumped up to me.   Without being a spoiler regarding the ending, I'll simply say that the answers to all of Denny's financial problems ...  gosh durn, how heartwarming.  Would make a great Disney flick.    No, no, it's not so horrible, I did read the whole darned thing cover to cover.   Thanks to the fabulous Drake Hotel in Toronto that provides a new hardcover novel (sure beats mints on the pillow), I didn't spend a dime, and enjoyed the pleasure of a mindless read.   But did not feel compelled to take it home with me.
067101756X|4.0|A very nice book to read. As for the facts, it is up to each and everyone to decide. I don't think we are alone, and this book if true just shows us one small encounter of humanity with the rest of life in the Universe.
0156034026|4.0|I have been following some of the reviews of this book and am not entirely surprised by a few of the negative comments about it. While the book may have a couple of drawbacks in style and structure it nevertheless delivers an extraordinary insight into the modern Muslim perspective and the dilemma or challenges posed by Western society. Many reviewing the book seemed to want the book to answer the 'problems' about Islam and Muslims rather that provide an analysis of the other side (i.e. the West)so when the the book took this new refreshing angle on the issue the response was to criticize and label the work as an attack on America and also somewhat sympathetic to the Islamic terrorist - a hypocrisy that the book excellently brings out making it uncomfortable reading for many. For those who want their preconceptions and  prejudices challenged this is a wonderful read but those looking for the same stale good Muslim /bad  Muslim dichotomy are likely to come out confused after reading this book.
0618918248|4.0|If you are an atheist this is a good book for you, but Richard does not really try to convince us that there is no God, his arguments are of a different kind.<br /><br />I was an atheist and I can understand Richard, but there is a higher place from atheism which pictures \\"God\\" in a different light than the classical one (bible). The progression is like this: God (bible) -> no God (atheism) -> new God (revelation)<br /><br />The book was a page turner at some points, in average about 100 pages were the good part. Sometimes I found it rather boring.<br /><br />A good book in average, but not what I expected, his aim was more to point out the flaws in religion (good arguments) than to prove that there is no God, purpose, etc.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|The Seldom Seen Kid, Elbow's newest CD, is my first exposure to this very good band. The lyrics are sophisticated, as is the sound, helped by the lush strings (cello, violin, and viola) and brass (coronet, flugel, and e flat horn, along with the usual suspects, trumpet and trombone). Their sound has been compared to Coldplay and Sigur Ros, but yet they make it their own. But I couldn't help think as I listened to this disc that while it has great intellectual qualities, I wasn't connecting on the same visceral level as, say, I do with two of my current favs, My Morning Jacket and Arcade Fire. Nevertheless, I  highly recommend this album.
1567184855|5.0|There is not much I can say, just read it. The book will stand for itself. If you are a religious person, in the religion type of doctrines, then you might have some problems with the book. If you search for a higher meaning and spirituality then you have to read this book.<br /><br />This book can have three outcomes:<br /><br />1. It can change your life.<br />2. It can help you advance in spiritual knowledge & awareness, supposing you already experienced point one.<br />3. Nothing changes, which might suggest you are in some form of religious doctrine which is against the pursuit of knowledge = stagnation.<br /><br />Be open and see the deeper message inside the book.

B000O5AYCA|4.0|Three of the music magazines I read on a regular basis anointed Boxer as the best album of 2007. The panegyrics were so similar, I had to wonder whether the same writer was working for all three magazines. Is Boxer good? Undoubtedly. But is it the best album of 2007? Not nearly.<br />I own a couple other albums by The National and already owned this at the time of its coronation. When compared to other albums by the band, Boxer comes as quite a surprise. It is lyrically reminiscent of Tindersticks and Arab Strap, but the vocals are mostly in a droning monotone. The music itself can be  surprisingly fast-paced in comparison with the vocals, the fact of which can give an impression of dissonance. Strong percussion and spare but excellent orchestration boost its appeal.<br />I pretty much enjoy the entire album with the exception of Green Gloves, which I do not care for. The best cuts are Mistaken For Strangers, Brainy, and Slow Show. A booklet containing lyrics would have been beneficial, after all The National are as much about their lyrics as they are about their music. What you get instead is an expanded cover insert that contains a few pictures and the usual album information.<br />With Boxer, The National shows fans that at least they are willing to take musical risks and not keep rehashing the tried and true. And that's a good thing. So while I reiterate that Boxer is not the best of 2007, that doesn't mean its not worth hearing.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Let's face it, the BBC puts American TV to absolute shame. While US TV continues to crank out a potpourri of lowest common denominator claptrap, the BBC produces quality, exciting, very well written and acted productions, such as State of Play. It's worth every penny! And while you're at it, check out The State Within too. Another fantastic effort from the BBC.
B0002Y4TM4|4.0|Though I didn't get around to getting this until recently, I had heard it before and had put it on my list of music to buy. From reading the reviews, it seems like there is a large contingent of reviewers giving Marbles a five-star rating. I won't go that far, but it is a strong effort and one that every Marillion fan should be sure to acquire.  The Invisible Man, which opens the CD, is an excellent prog opus that spurs listener expectations of a masterpiece. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen but much of what follows is quite good. In addition to the opener, I like You're Gone, Angelina, Don't Hurt Yourself, Fantastic Place, and Neverland. Oddly enough, none of the four \\"sections\\" of the title cut do a lot for me.  Admittedly, Marillion's output has been haphazard in quality over the years though the good albums surely outnumber the disappointments. But Marbles is an album that showcases the best side of the band. If you are a Marillion fan and don't have Marbles yet, now is the time to add it to your collection.
0743454537|4.0|Sara was the only person whose perspective I could not understand.  I could empathize with everyone else in the book.      I'm 5/6 of the way done with this in audiobook format and every time the actress who portrays Sara comes on I cringe.  She is such a martyr and to me completley unsympathetic.  When Jesse tells Sara that she could turn a conversation about the Red Sox into a conversation about Kate, he's dead on target.  This being said I really, really like this book.        At what point do you see your child(ren) suffering and miserable with reduced quality of life with no chance of a cure and still continue with risky and invasive treatment?  Brian, Jesse and Anna all seem to understand that Kate's death is inevitable - not that they are confortable with it and not that they don't love her or anticipate missing Kate - but Sara seems to be stuck in the denial stage of grief.      I didn't \\"get\\" that she loved or understood Anna at all, and I felt that at points Sara was holding on to Kate without really understanding Kate either.  And I felt it morally reprehensible that both she and Brian had just given up on Jesse.  They treat his moving into the garage, isolation, underage drinking, and other unusual behavior etc. very cavalierly.      It seemed to be all about Sara and how much she was suffering.  I guess I just don't buy the whole \\"this hurts me more than it hurts you\\" thing.

B0012Q732O|5.0|Who cares if it isn't historically accurate.  We weren't there 10,000 years ago and can only guess what it was like based on bones of animals and humans and tools dug up.  As to their relationships other than banding together to hunt, we don't know since they didn't leave a written history.  It is a great movie of a story that might have been.  I enjoy stories.  I don't want sex for the sake of sexual exploitation and rediculuous violence for the sake of violence.  It was a love story as well as an action story making it one that my wife and I could enjoy together.  It has heros and bad guys.  It has adventure and shows family life.  It may be about early man but is still relevant to life today.  We just have more gagets in our lives.  If you didn't like the movie then that is your problem and you have a right to like sex and gore but if a movie doesn't have a story to tell it is worthless.  This one had a really good story to tell.

1591841984|1.0|It's a curious fact that, unlike previous advances in communications technology, the computer revolution has produced only one real celebrity. As movies, radio and TV came along, each spawned dozens of superstars, but with computers, electronics and the Internet, it's only Steve Jobs. Yes, we know who Bill Gates is, but he is regarded only as some fabulously wealthy tycoon -- similar to Warren Buffett or C. Montgomery Burns. But soon, there will be more celebrity profiles written about Steve Jobs than about Elvis or Marilyn Monroe combined.<br /><br />Unfortunately, such books are seldom literary masterpieces, and \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\" by Leander Kahney seems thrown together to make a quick buck. It contains little information that has not seen print many times, and it's certain that Steve Jobs, always wary of the press, provided no more cooperation to Leander Kahney than he would to \\"Tiger Beat.\\"<br /><br />Marketed as a sympathetic look at Chairman Steve, the book dishes no dirt. There's no dish at all. Instead, we get yet another history of Apple Computer, a history of Pixar, an interview with Apple's senior vice president for industrial design, Jonathan Ive, the same accounts of the releases of the iPod and the iPhone that you read in the newspaper, and a fulsome testimonial to the Apple Stores. All this may be of interest to someone who is very young or who has just returned from a long journey to a distant galaxy, but the rest of us already know what Jobs said to John Sculley to lure him away from Pepsi Cola. (Hint: something about selling sugar water.)<br /><br />In the place of any new information, Mr. Kahney relies on traditional techniques used by schoolboys who must submit a book report for a book they didn't quite read -- padding and repetition and padding and also repetition, a remarkable amount of repetition.<br /><br />For instance, on page 142 we learn that \\"When Jobs hired Ron Johnson from Target to head up Apple's retail effort, he asked him to use an alias for several months lest anyone get wind that Apple was planning to open retail stores. Johnson was listed on Apple's phone directory under a false name, which he used to check into hotels.\\"<br /><br />In case the reader has forgotten this information by page 207, we are again told, \\"At first Johnson couldn't tell anyone he was working for Apple. He used the alias John Bruce . . . and a phony title to stop competitors from getting wind of Apple's retail plans.\\"<br /><br />Readers who give serious study to this book will certainly wish to use their yellow highlighters on the amazing fact that the Apple Stores are, \\". . .  not too big and not too small.\\" Those who have been too timid to enter an Apple Store will be glad to learn on page 203 that, \\"There's no pressure to spend any money, and the staff is happy to answer any question.\\" And those who are unable to form any short-term memories will be delighted to learn on page 204 that, \\"There is no pressure to spend, and the staff is friendly and helpful.\\" A sentence later it is revealed that, \\"Apple's stores are no-pressure hangouts where the customers can play with the machines . . .\\" All of which makes one relieved that Apple has enough sense not to hire such a hack to write the copy for its ads.<br /><br />If you have been misinformed and assume that people are interested in computers as furniture, Leander Kahney provides a lightning-bolt of a revelation: \\"Customers rarely buy computers for the hardware alone; they're more interested in the software it can run.\\"  This stuff's gold, people, gold! But as for Apple's iLife suite of applications -- iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand-- \\"They haven't proven to be killer apps.\\"<br /><br />So if the book is nothing but threadbare history of Apple and a panegyric to the pressure-free marvel of Apple Stores, why is it called \\"Inside Steve's Brain\\"? Because the glory contained inside is that Leander Kahney ends each chapter with a list of \\"Lessons from Steve,\\" and theseare surely the most inspiring truisms you've ever read. Perhaps you'll want to copy these onto flash cards and carry them in your hat band:<br />* Seek out opportunities.<br />* Don't worry where the ideas come from.<br />* Don't be afraid of trial and error.<br />* Embrace the team.<br />* Don't lose sight of the customer.<br />* Concentrate on products.<br />* Seek out the highest quality.<br />* Don't force it.<br />* Find an easy way to present new ideas.<br /><br />Each of these \\"Lessons from Steve\\" (none of which were ever spoken by Steve, of course) is so inspiring that any one of them could replace the \\"Work Smarter, Not Harder\\" sign in your cubicle. If he is capable of dispensing such scintillating wisdom, surely \\"Wired\\" magazine is too lowly a station for a man of Leander Kahney's talents. I believe it's only a matter of time until he moves up to a medium most suited to his gift with words: say, the covers of matchbooks, washing instruction tags on garments, the safety warnings which begin the owner's manuals of cheap appliances.are surely the most inspiring truisms you've ever read.

B00007JMCX|5.0|Anybody who loves science fiction as much as I do should have seen this movie a long time ago and studied it closely.  Yet I only recently was introduced to [[ASIN:B00007JMCX The Man Who Fell to Earth]] and was mesmerized.<br /><br />For the time period it was made, it is visually incredible.  The story line is also excellent considering how unbelievable the premise is.  I would also state it is probably easily misunderstood because of the subtle use of cues and disjointed plot structure.  But this movie cements what I already believed to be true: David Bowie is a creative genius who deserves more acclaim than he gets.<br /><br />It's interesting that in a movie in which Bowie was cast, the music is very non-Bowie. I'm sure that was meant to not overshadow his performance, which is incredible.  I don't want to give away too much detail, but the title kind of says it all.  If I had to summarize this movie briefly, I would say it was like [[ASIN:0767812166 Starman]] meets [[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial]] and [[ASIN:B000EXDSCA Valley of the Dolls]].<br /><br />I will add this: please avoid the reviews with spoilers.  Several comments have been made which are not totally accurate.  Watch the movie yourself and watch carefully.  Then you can draw your own conclusion.<br /><br />Like I said, the special effects are very good, yet tastefully done for the time period.  They are not overly done as some other sci-fi of the late 70s and early 80s.<br /><br />We learn about Bowie's character little by little through a series of flashbacks.  These definitely highten the anticipation, but they also make the story disjointed.  When we do finally see what Bowie truly is, it's an incredible climax.<br /><br />There's also plenty of hippie-like scenes as Bowie's character is pulled out of his shell by a very unique female character.  I personally felt like her lines could have been better, but she does a good enough job.<br /><br />Rip Torn's character is perhaps the biggest enigma.  I suspect that the film-makers purposely left some ambiguity as to his role in Bowie's demise.<br /><br />I am not surprised by those who want simple explainations all laid out for them in a movie like this.  This is meant to be an unconventional story told in an artistic way.  Despite what some may say, there is a great deal of beauty and profundity in the way this story is told.<br /><br />The supporting cast is good, though there are definitely some characters who are given less dialogue than they deserved.<br /><br />The closure of this movie definitely made me feel sad for the world and mankind in general.  Draw your own conclusions, but watch carefully or you will misunderstand what is really happening.<br /><br />I would say anybody who loves sci-fi and hasn't seen this should see it soon.  I may have been the last guy to this party, but if there are any others out there like me definitely check this out.<br /><br />Enjoy.osely left some ambiguity as to his role in Bowie's demise.

006091307X|5.0|One day Mrs. Oedipa Maas discovers that she has been made executor of her ex-lover's will. As she proceeds she discovers that the legacy with which she has been entrusted draws her ever deeper into a complex web of conspiracies. Yet what she has discovered may be no more than her own paranoia, and the novel ends ambiguously with the final revelation still impending like a judgement day forever suspended.    The book walks a careful line between the comic and the tragic. It is a difficult balance and Pynchon maintains it beautifully. Unlike many literary comic novelists Pynchon is genuinely funny. Yet as Oedipa wanders around San Francisco encountering alienation and loss everywhere she turns a genuine pathos creeps into the humor.    I'm sure there are many ways to read the Crying of Lot 49. I think we may approach it as both a social satire of consumerism and as a larger statement about the breakdown of communication in all human communities.     On the whole I consider this to be one of my favorite novels.

0895260131|5.0|After spending four tours in Iraq and just getting home from the last one, I can say that what is said in this book is correct.     There is no more the rising threat, but the threat that has already risen and is here in the US.     I suggest you, the reader, understand that Islam is more a tribal/political system than it is a religion. It's about control and who can gain it. I know there will be critics saying we have done the same. But the US has evolved and surrounds itself with life - or rebirth. Islam is engulfed in death and chaos.     Buy this book and read it to your children - educate them - Islam is worst than communism could ever dream of being. I also suggest the book, Because They Hate, Islamic Invasion, and Hostage to the Devil to see - or at least read - what US military personnel are experiencing in defending your rights here in the US.

0618918248|5.0|Now in my late 40's, I grew up quite literally in the shadow of Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, OK--the epicenter of American Evangelicals.  My Mother was Roman Catholic and my father Southern Baptist.  It's taken many years and Herculean effort to escape such an auspicious orbit.  And I thought I had long escaped.  I eventually settled into a live-and-let-live, middle-of-the-road agnosticism.<br /><br />Then I read this book.  And I realized that that passive acceptance, that \\"live and let live\\" approach to American Fundamentalist Christianity I'd held, was itself dangerous.  By not openly refuting something so blatantly ignorant and destructive, I was passively contributing to it.  I now realize this to be clearly true and I thank the author for this powerful distinction.  Especially as I reflected back on my own religious indoctrination, as a very young child, I desperately needed even a wink from a wise soul, as if to say, \\"Don't worry son, the smart ones don't actually drink the kool-aid.\\"  Only after reading this book, I realized, I had to start standing up for what I believe in.  And especially, for what I don't believe in.<br /><br />Those schooled reviewers who criticize Dawkins as being too hard on religion or especially personal spirituality are still missing the point.  If you believe in anything other than a Fundamentalist, Literalistic interpretation of religious texts, you are abjectly hypocritical.  If forced to accept your own believes literally, you would abandon them.  Moreover, by accepting them as being divine but also vague, you accept that any interpretation is acceptable--it's a personal choice (and yet, a divine overarching truth).  You might then say, those choices, however, have limitations--say laws to prevent inspired apostles applying their personal interpretation as to fly planes into tall buildings.  But then you're saying religious texts are superseded by laws, composed by sober societies.  So your religious ideal is now relegated to a very vague, still divine, but not proscriptive idea, which you're entitled to because it makes you feel good.  Like smoking pot.  And yet, indulging even privately in that inebriant is illegal.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading this book in corroboration with Letters to a Christian Nation by Sam Harris and Misquoting Jesus by Epstein.<br /><br />This book is important.

B0014127BO|3.0|I have been a Bryan Adams fan for 20+ years, have purchased every one of his albums and have seen him in concert over 40 times.  His new album, 11, unfortunately, is his weakest, by far.  The songs lack that biting edge tht Bryan provided us with back in the good ole days of Reckless.  That being said, the album has a couple of decent ballads.  I am a huge BA fan, so the lowest rating I am humanly able to give \\"11\\" is 3 out of 5 stars.  Hopefully the BA of old will come back to grace us again at some point in the future!

0670020745|5.0|I was reading this book and my 11 year old asked if I would read it aloud as her grandfather (whom she was really close to) had a stoke 4 years ago and has since passed.  I had just finished the beginning portion of the book which discusses brain anatomy and was starting the authors description of what happened the day of the stroke. We found it fascinating.      We were on vacation and on one of the flights another child sat by us; he was equally enthralled by this book and wrote down the title so his mom could buy it and read it to him.    Not only does this book describe what happened to the author but gives practical advice which the reader can use to live a happier life.  This is backed up by scientific understanding of brain function and anatomy.    Also, the language in this book is quite lovely...very poetic...and was a joy to read.  The ending was awesome!    I highly recommend this book to everyone.

I deeply hope it is put into film so a wider audience knows of it.  Wherever Ishmael is now I hope he is at peace and finding joy in his life.

Throughout, Indian history, the rulers of the continent at any time didn't have the ability to recognize the \\"White Tigers\\" among them. Ehalivan from Mahabarata comes to mind and in the South, Nanthanar's story is another example of a \\"White Tiger\\". Aravind Adiga's \\"White Tiger\\" is a powerful novel and it highlights the main weakness of an otherwise creative civilization.  Well done, Mr. Aravind Adiga!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|The movie was absolutely AMAZING! It will really touch your heart to see a man (William Wilberforce) who gave everything to change the world.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Oh my gosh....my boyfriend and I discovered this show on a local tv station November 2007.  After watching the 3rd season we had to look it up and buy the first season.  This is the best show either of us have seen in long time. Watching it on dvd is like watching a 20+ hour movie.    It's full of urban legends, spooky stories and has a sense of humor.  The cast is beyond excellent - especially Jared and Jensen as Sam and Dean...wow...you guys really make me believe that you are brothers. The writing is terrific...the directors are incredible. Everyone involved with making this series deserves to win awards. I have to say that this is my favorite show of all time and we are going to buy the other seasons.  We hope this series will continue for many years to come and we wish we could give you more than 5 stars.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I bought this because there is a scene cut out of the UK version. Peter is very lucky because he can fly about all day.I tested the DVD and it works just the same as the UK one and there is an extra scene which you don't see in the UK verson of the film. It is where Hook and Peter are in the Black Castle.<br /><br />Both films are excellent,UK and the US version.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|I saw all of these episodes on TV but they didn't even begin to compare to the HD version.  They exhibited attention to detail and continuity.  The episodes were in the original order that they appeared on TV.      My only issue was with the menus.  The interface took a minute to figure out what they wanted me to do and I am normally really good at picking up anything and just going with it.    Bottom line is if you are a Trekker and you have a HD-DVD player you need this. If you don't have an HD-DVD player it is still a great collectible and the DVD side is clear and very entertaining.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Some have branded John Cameron Mitchell's \\"Shortbus\\" as pornographic.  I'm not sure what they (or any of us, for that matter) mean by \\"pornography,\\" but I suspect that people who apply the word to \\"Shortbus\\" intend it as a synonym for \\"sex.\\"  There's lots of sex in \\"Shortbus,\\" but it's sex that's celebratory, fun, funny, poignant, self-revealing, and loving.<br /><br />Humans are sexual creatures, and our sexuality is irreducibly connected to our personal identities, our ability to love (as well as our ability to hate), and our need for companionship as social animals.  In \\"Shortbus,\\" the complexity of sexuality is explored through several interrelated story lines:  Sophia's (masterfully played by Sook-Yin Lee) search for satisfaction, Jamie's (P.J. DeBoy) and James' (Paul Dawson) almost tragic but ultimately fruitful love for one another, Severin's (Lindsay Beamish) fear of intimacy, and drag performance artist Justin Bond's wonderfully exuberant celebration of human love in all its manifestations.  One particularly touching scene is an encounter between an \\"ex-mayor of NYC,\\" a gay, thinly disguised Koch, who reflects on loneliness, aging, and AIDS.<br /><br />The film's dialogue is witty at times, poignant at others.  The actors are all, without exception, quite good.  The cinematography is superb.  The presentation is uninhibited, honest, funny, and thought-provoking.  If this is pornography, hurrah for porn.
0446402389|5.0|I usually pick light reads, so I wouldn't typically read this kind of a book, but my husband read it and loved it.  He suggested that I would like it, so I dove in.  I read it in a day.  It was full of suspense.  I loved reading the details of Communist Russia.  I have visited there and it's hard to know where Russians are coming from, but this book helps me understand more.      I felt for the main character and the children in this story.  It is heartbreaking and the gore is pretty limited.  I would suggest this book to anyone.  It's great!
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|For sheer technological artistry, it's difficult to see how the Kino remastering of \\"Nosferatu\\" could be surpassed.  Visual quality is excellent and the original 1922 Hans Erdmann score is (at long last) made available.  Supplementing the digitalized film is an hour-long documentary on the making of \\"Nosferatu,\\" as well as clips from director F.W. Murnau's other films.  All in all, Ausgeseichnet!<br /><br />\\"Nosferatu\\" really is an amazing film (and I say this as someone not particularly fond of the vampire genre).  Murnau's expressionist cinematography creates an eeriness that's never been matched.  The long, lean Count Orlok (Max Schreck), his fingers unnaturally talon-like, arms stiffly at his side like a corpse's, eyes wide open but somehow dead, can frighten even modern audiences who've been trained by special effects artists to demand much from spooky movies.  The shipboard scene of Nosferatu rising from his coffin is uncanny.  Murnau also speeds up the camera when he films Nosferatu in motion, thereby suggesting that what the viewer is seeing is unnatural, other-worldly.<br /><br />For the most part, Gustav von Wangenheim's Hutter (parallel to Stoker's Jonathan Harker) is competent, although there are a few of those overdone melodramatic moments one associates with silent film.  At one point, for example, Hutter slams a book about vampires on the floor to express his amused contempt for such superstitions.  But the scene is so over-acted that it comes across as more funny than anything else.  Greta Schroeder's Ellen (Stoker's Lucy) is a flop.  Schroeder seems incapable of not overacting in the grand style of silent movie queens satirized in \\"Sunset Boulevard.\\"  Alexander Granach's Knock (Stoker's Renfield) is, in my judgment, the real star of the film.  Granach perfectly captures the creepy madness of Knock/Renfield.  His performance is stellar.<br /><br />The libidinal tension implicit in all vampire stories also comes through in \\"Nosferatu.\\"  In one scene in which Nosferatu is preying on Ellen, she cups one of her breasts and Nosferatu's shadow cups the other.  A gripping, masterful image, and one that's not been bested by the thousand and one Dracula re-makes since \\"Nosferatu.\\"ying on Ellen, she cups one of her breasts and Nosferatu's shadow cups the other.

1878424505|5.0|I've been reading through some of the reviews of this book, positive and negative.  Of course there are lots of books out there about the same thing.  Of course we've heard all this before.  But personally, this book actually broke through and made sense to me.  Like in those old cartoons where a light bulb turns on over your head.  I read this book and it all made sense; I saw what I was doing, I looked at myself honestly and made real changes.  I don't know what makes this book different from the others that tell you basically the same thing.  I think, though, that it is its simplicity.  Don't give people power over you.  Not a lot of psychological studies, case histories and boring details.  Just simple and honest advice.  Take back the power.  When people hurt you, you allow them to.  You agree to it.  Maybe this doesn't make sense to everyone.  But this book changed my entire life view and I believe that it will do the same for anyone who reads it with an open mind and an honest vision of themselves.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was at Borders today looking for some exercise DVDs when I came across \\"30 Day Shred.\\" I took out my phone and decided to google the reviews. Everyone said it was challenging, so of course I said, \\"I bet it's not that hard!\\" I bought it, and came home and did it. Boy, was I wrong! I just got finished with work out 1, and I am sweating like you wouldn't believe. It's very easy to follow, but it is extremely intense... and I love it! As much as you're body will be burning and you want to stop, the encouragement she gives you throughout the work out, and the pain you're feeling... is a good thing!   This is by far one of the best work out DVDs. I will recommend it to everyone!!
B000094HMU|5.0|I was a little reluctant to purchase such a popular title; however, I was not disappointed because the costumes and performances were wonderful.  I found myself clapping from my living room when watching.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The older Disney movie's were and are my favorites.    This version of Snow White is vibrant and beautiful - the movie has never looked better.    Like most Disney DVDs that come and go in their releases it can be sometimes hard to find, so make sure to get the DVD when you can.
B000002KN8|5.0|Except for What's Your Name, which is quite awful, this is a great record. It's simple, light, and rather comically gay-tinged, even though the lineup is all heterosexual. One can even see the leather bar look the band had on YouTube. I second the reviewer who said seek out the version that comes with the b-sides. This record shows bubble gum pop done right, unlike A Broken Frame. I'm not sure about the extended Just Can't Get Enough. Maybe that's something that was added later because I recall my tape had the regular version.
0312330863|5.0|All Things Bright and Beautiful by James Herriot is a true classic and I can see why it has been such a big seller through many decades.  Sadly, I missed seeing his books when they were made into a television series.  This autobiographical work is charming and delightful.<br /><br />Jim Herriot was a vet in Yorkshire, England.  He was pretty much a country veterinarian, servicing farm animals for most of his years.  He began his career when the practice of being a vet was pretty much in the dark ages.  Antibiotics were not yet on the horizon and many of today's vaccines weren't invented.  Each chapter is a story about a different experience--birthing a lamb, caring for injured animals, judging a favorite pet contest, tasting homemade wine, etc.  Through them all, we get to sense Jim's love for his job, his patients, and the simple but grateful folk he came in contact with every day.  Many times, being a vet was also to be a detective.  He often had to come up with a diagnosis for a mystery ailment, and he had to deal with everything from copper deficiencies to hairballs.  As in life, not all of his stories have happy endings.<br /><br />I am happy to have finally acquainted myself with James Herriot and will definitely read more of his books.  I have already started James Herriot's Dog Stories.
B000002KZA|2.0|People are People is a better choice than this one. It has the good songs from it and doesn't include the bad. The Landscape is Changing is beyond overripe. More Than A Party is... um...
0316143472|3.0|I love David Sedaris. 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' is one of the funniest books (if not the funniest) I've ever read. 'Naked' is also fantastic. I liked 'Dress Your Children in Corduroy and Denim' as well, so when I saw that Sedaris had a new book coming out, I ordered it from Amazon immediately.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I wanted to like this book. Furthermore, I expected to like it. But, while a few stories elicited a chuckle, for the most part is was not very funny. And the last section of the book was kind of all over the place and could have used more editing, I think.<br /><br />I still love David Sedaris, I will still read every book he comes out with, but this one is just not my favorite.
B000002L75|2.0|I was a huge fan of DM albums like Music for the Masses, Black Celebration, and Violator. I also enjoyed People are People, some songs on Broken Frame and much of Speak and Spell. But, most of this record never did anything for me. It is rare for me to have had a tape in the 80s that I didn't really try to like from bands I liked. But, a few songs like Lie to Me are good as I recall, but People are People is a stronger \\"early Mode\\" post Speak and Spell choice. Stick with Music for the Masses, Violator, Black Celebration, People are People, and Speak and Spell.
B000MBN7SE|5.0|I've known about Wishbone Ash for over 30 years, but never gave them much of a listen. I supposed I'd heard them several times while living in the barracks at Torrejon Air Base, in Spain, but had other bands to keep me occupied.<br /><br />I finally dug this one out of my record collection because I'd heard Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash was going to play some gigs this October (2008) with my friend Tony McPhee from The Groundhogs.<br /><br />After listening to it, I can see why so many of my guitar playing friends loved them. This is guitar music! To start with, it opened a lot mellower than the image I had of them. But when they finally kicked into the first song, about three or four minutes into it, these guys ROCKED!<br /><br />All of the songs are fairly long, five to nine minutes, with only Leaf and Stream clocking in at a little over 3 minutes. When I heard they wanted to replace Martin Turner as vocalist at one point in their long career, I thought that was a stupid idea as he is an excellent singer.<br /><br />Most of the songs start out slow, then kick into the hard driving jams. The soloing, especially on the second track, have a Lynrd Skynrd tone and feel to them, but this is not southern rock. I guess it's progressive rock, but I've come to associate keyboards as part of that mix, so I just don't know.<br /><br />Whatever the case, this is an album all guitarists can appreciate, well, except for the \\"anti-solo\\" breed. This is great stuff, good songs, good playing, and good singing. Also, the solos seem more an organic part of the songs, rather than the songs just being excuses to solo. Highly recommended.
B0013527I4|5.0|Like Muppet show 1 and 2 the 3rd season keeps up. It is very entertaining and can be enjoyed by people of all ages.
B00005JPNZ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Let's face it, nothin will ever match \\"Raiders\\" but this is a far cry better than \\"Temple of Doom\\" which I apsolutely hated.  It was fun to see Karen Allen again and I think she has aged very gracefully - doesn't look as though she's paid a dozen visits to a plastic surgeon.  I admit that I found the whole ET storyline a little far fetched but I still had a great time watching this film.  I also really enjoyed all the little bits which paid homage to the past films.

0393061310|5.0|I can't add much to the good reviews, but I wanted to suggest that if your child is taking history in school or shows an interest before that, please buy them this book.      This action will reflect the main premise of the book's theory, it will create the environment for growth.
B0017KP93U|5.0|I'm the type of fan that this compilation is meant for, to answer a prior posed question. I have OK Computer and In Rainbows, but no other Radiohead CDs. The music is great, and I heard songs that I liked from the past, but hadn't even registered in my head as being from Radiohead(such as Creep). This helps me catch up with the band.  Also...if you like this, you need to look out for Tom's brother's CD, coming out July 18. Andy Yorke fronted the band The Unbelievable Truth, and the couple of songs I've heard from the new release show that it promises to be outstanding. The solo CD will be called Simple.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan has got to be one of the best disney (or even not disney) films out there. It is full of themes such as love, courage, persistence, ambition, piety, and many others that can captivate not only a child, but an adult as well. Mulan goes through difficult stages of life, which force her her grow and learn, as this wonderful film takes you along for a journey of personal growth of your own.    I would recommend this film to people of all ages!
0811729117|3.0|I found the memoir \\"Tigers in the Mud\\" interesting, but not the best or not the most exciting of the WWII memoirs I have read. I am an avid WWII reader, but not a military historian, so perhaps this book was not intended for me.    For one, much of the book depends on the reader's understanding of the battles and combat situations. I am familiar with some of the major East Front battles, but I think this book would have benefited more from some summaries of the situations before launching into the details. For example, perhaps some more details prefacing \\"Gatschina had to be given up\\" would have helped to understand why the Panzer leaders were in the situation they were in. A few more maps might have helped the reader understand the situations.    Secondly, the translation is a bit stilted, and full of German idioms that do not survive literal translation. I see many passages that appear lifeless. \\"Not a single creature was to be seen in these dead woods.\\" I was also tired of seeing the many quoted expressions. \\"My 'hungry' and 'freezing' men sat at a table as if in peace-time.\\" Was it really needed to quote hungry and freezing? Either they were or they were not. Even the word Tiger is quoted throughout the book.    I also expected a bit more on the details of the Tiger tanks, or even his earlier experiences with the 38ts. These details are somewhat limited.    In the end, I enjoyed the book for the details and the matters-of-fact that were mentioned, but I expected a bit more of a framework or a lively drama in which the details are given.
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|I fell in love with Eurotrip the moment I saw it. Yes, it is VERY high in sexual content, but you understand, it's done to attract attention.     Eurotrip is full of hilarious moments, even aside from the sex. \\"Scotty doesn't know\\" was stuck in my head for days, and I'm singing it as I'm writing this review! =D And I gotta say, Lucy Lawless was totally awesome in her role as madame Vandersex!!    Don't let little kids, nor older people watch it. It's too inappropriate for kids and parents are likely to hate it. I'd say this movie is for teens and young(er) adults.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. it doesnt get much better than that. these guys have outstanding chemestry, which isnt surprising considering their history (Spaced. its a great British TV show, yet to become Region 1) anyway, what makes this movie so amazing you ask? its a great horror movie, and its a great comedy. most movies cant walk such a fine line so well. if it wasnt for the lead duo it would be a straigh up zombie fest, and a good one at that, but its the addition of the hilarious antics of Simon and Nick that push this movie beyond the pale of any horror/comedy to come before it.<br /><br />basically the story focuses on Shaun(Simon Pegg) and his time leading up to, during, and after the outbreak. its hilarious watching how oblivious he is during the start of the chaos (ie \\"she's so drunk!\\") haha priceless.<br /><br />the camera work, acting, gore effects, and anything else you can think of are all spot on. you couldnt ask much more of this movie. its pretty much perfect. so much care and attention when into every second of shooting this movie. you'll be finding new things to laugh about throughout the movie every time you see it. it gets better and better with repeated viewings.<br /><br />best horror-comedy ever.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This is definately a must have if you have a Blue Ray Disc Player. The videography is excellent. You can see a lot of exciting natural phenomenon rrecorded well in the video, which you would never see in nature by your own eyes..    What I did not like in the whole 4 disc coverage is the lack of depth of subject. You can say it has breadth, but no dept. In most cases, it gives a glimpse of some exciting natural beutym but you would long to see more. The authour/narrator seemed to have too many things, but very less time to put everything together.    I hope this helps your decision to buy this. In spite of the limitation as mentioned, I would still say it is a must have.    [[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]]

B00005JPNZ|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />*spoilers*<br /><br />Looking remarkably hale and fit for a man in his 60's, Harrison Ford returns as everyone's favorite archaeologist/adventurer in \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\\" the fourth installment in the series that started with \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" way back in 1981 (before Dr. Jones had sufficient notoriety to get his name placed in the title).<br /><br />It's 1957 and Indy's off on his latest adventure, hacking his way through the jungles of Peru in search of a mysterious crystal skull that may be a relic from a race of extraterrestrials who visited the area several millenia ago.  He is joined in his quest by Shia Labeouf as a cocky, motorcycle-riding teenager who may have more in common with the old codger than either of them can imagine; Karen Allen in a fun return as Jones' old flame from \\"Raiders\\" who's been kidnapped by some Russian agents; John Hurt as a fellow archaeologist who may already have fallen under the spell of the mysterious ancient artifact; and Cate Blanchett as an evil Soviet scientist intent on getting her hands on the object as a means of giving her country a strategic advantage in the escalating Cold War.<br /><br />\\"Crystal Skull\\" is not a great action flick by any means but, like its predecessors, it has a comfy old-fashioned quality that has us rooting for the good guys and against the bad guys in the best Saturday-afternoon-matinee tradition.  Director Steven Spielberg manages to get the adrenalin pumping with his exciting, if frankly preposterous, action sequences (ably enhanced by John Williams' made-to-order score) and the funny bone twitching with a series of smart-alecky one-liners, many of them aimed at Indiana's obviously advanced age, which the writer, David Koepp, in his wisdom, has chosen not to ignore but rather to make the object of some entirely good-natured joshing.<br /><br />These factors alone compensate for the over length, the occasional bog down in the action, and a finale that feels more appropriate to \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" than to the Indiana Jones franchise.<br /><br />More than anything else, perhaps, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" proves that you don't have to be in your 20's or 30's to be a robust, whip-cracking, action movie hero.  That's encouraging news for all of us regardless of age.\\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\" than to the Indiana Jones franchise.

B000PGTPE6|5.0|I enjoyed this album very much.  It is lively foot stooping music with lots of good songs and sounds.  While I like Bruce Springsteen's music, I am not a big fan.  However, this album is different;  it gets the feet moving.  I like all the songs, but I keep finding myself going back to listen to Further On (Up the Road).  Highly recommended.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|The title of track four says it all. A remarkable return to form! There are floor-fillers with 'Stamp Your Feet', 'Crayons' and 'The Queen is Back' as well as two 5-star ballads in 'Sand On My Feet' and (possibly my favourite track) 'Be Myself Again', on which Donna's real, not electronically enhanced voice really comes through, with just a piano behind it! Treat yourself to this today.
0316143472|5.0|I was introduced to David Sedaris when a relative of mine was in a coma for 5 months. I was told that someone was coming to the hospital, sitting beside the bed and reading from the \\"Chicken Soup\\" series of books.  I was horrified as I'd been told that a person in a coma can still hear and I couldn't fathom the torture my loved one must be in - unable to move or communicate and being subjected to a torture akin to mental water boarding.  Immediately I put the word out for some other essay series that could be read to him that would nullify the damage being done by this well intentioned person.  David Sedaris was suggested several times and this is how I met him (literarily speaking).<br />I have \\"Engulfed\\" in the audio version that's read by the author.  My favorites from Sedaris are always when he relates tales about his boyhood and goofy family. There's plenty to be found here.  In this compilation I found the new bike essay interesting, the crotchety lady neighbor hilarious, but the whole smoking cessation portion was so close to home that it was a bit unnerving.  He went to Japan, I went to Mexico.  It worked for him, not for me...<br />I highly recomend this book - you can never go wrong with Sedaris (even if your in a coma)...bg
B00127RAJY|4.0|By the time I started to get so tired that I couldn't do anything else, it was cool down time. I'm not big into exercise, so this video is perfect for me. I also am not terribly coordinated for things like steps and complicated moves. This video incorporates moves that I can do - jumping jacks, push ups, squats - and keeps my heart rate up enough to make a 30 minute workout all I need. It hasn't been 30 days yet, so I can't claim that I've lost a lot of weight. However, I can imagine doing this video consistently. My knees hurt a little, but they do anyway.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|If I should pick the five greatest films I have seen in my life, The Lives of Others would be one of them.  It is a story of people living in the GDR before the collapse of the Wall.  It is a study in how much people can and cannot endure.<br /><br />The performances are breathtaking - no point in selecting a few of the actors to praise, as even the actors who have no lines excel in their craft.  The music, the costumes, the settings, all are fitting and magnificent.<br /><br />Praise must be given the most for the film's creator and director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.  He spent many years of his life developing what can only be considered one of the great films of our time.  He made this film with limited funds, and even when it was completed, all but one distribution company in Germany refused to be involved with it.  Ha! Ha! Ha! on them when it finally won the Academy Award for best foreign film is all I can say.<br /><br />I found it fascinating, after watching the film without the director's comments, to re-watch it with the comments.  The director shares how the film came to birth, and the many elements which came to play in its making.  I saw the film with new eyes as the director related details of each scene's making.<br /><br />This is a very exciting film which I know I will watch again and again from here on!  And I thank the director for his stamina and persistence in making his vision a reality.

I adore Michelle Pfeiffer, and Matthew Broderick adds both the humor and endearing devotion to helping break the evil spell that will bring the lovers together again forever.  This movie is a classic that will always be enjoyed by everyone.

1595141715|1.0|THIRTEEN REASONS WHY has an interesting premise.  Given the numerous already existing reviews, I won't go into too much detail about the plot other than to say the story revolves around a set of tapes, a recorded memoir leading up to her suicide, that were sent out by a girl shortly after she committed the act. The intended audience for her tapes were the people she blamed for contributing to, nay causing, her suicide.  Like I said, an interesting premise that I had hoped had a twist to it.  Because, after all, this novel had strong reviews of readers praising its message and agreeing with it entirely.  The message is this (caution: spoiler alert!): the people in this story are entirely to blame for the character who took her own life, therefore removing all accountability for her own actions (by this, I mean committing suicide).  Now, I get what the author was trying to achieve and I think it was noble.  Mr. Asher wanted to provoke some thought about how our actions, even if we view as harmless or insignificant, can significantly impact another and that we should consider his cautionary tale with all future interactions with people in our own lives. I respect that, which is why I gave this novel one star, as opposed to none.  However, what I believe Mr. Asher missed entirely was that suicide attempts and completions are entirely selfish acts, leaving so many people destroyed in its wake.  True, the characters in this book create a miserable life for Hannah (the girl who commits suicide), but ultimately the decision to take her own life is hers, and hers alone. THIRTEEN REASONS WHY removes all accountability from Hannah and places it all on the other characters, blaming them for an action they didn't commit.  Moreover, the story also places a heavy load of guilt AND BLAME on the well-intentioned and \\"good guy\\" characters in the story for not stopping a suicide.  Again, no accountability for the character who took her life, just the ones that had to experience the aftermath.      I devoured this book, reading it in just a few hours.  I did so not because I was enjoying it, but because I was desperately hoping that my suspicion that the book was placing accountability on the wrong characters would be blown away; it was not.    To close, in life other people's actions influence our own behavior, but ultimately, the only one to blame or be accountable for our own behavior is ourself...even regarding suicide.  This was a terrible read.

B0012E6R3W|5.0|I've been listening to metal music since 1980 and followed all the trends and twists on the form that have surfaced. When it comes to trash I've listened to it and enjoyed for the last 25 years. There are few releases that I regard as among the best; Reign In Blood and Seasons In The Abyss by Slayer, Bonded By Blood by Exodus, Master Of Puppets and Ride The Lightning Metallica, Peace Sells and Rust In Peace by Megadeth among others.     I've always enjoyed Testament up to a certain degree but never felt they released an album worthy of a inclusion on a top 10 Trash Album list.     But with The Formation Of Damnation they have created a masterpiece of Trash Metal. Sticking to their roots but infusing it with elements of Death and Black Metal. It's catchy as hell, brutal and allt the instruments played with musical mastery.    This is the surely the best Metal release of 2008 and they have set the standard for modern metal that will be very hard to beat.     It will be very interesting to see what the \\"masters\\" Metallica will come up with in Death Magnetic. I surely hope Lars, Kirk, James and Robert are listening to this Testament relaese and sweating over how the hell they are going to top it.     Go out and get it!

But do not waste your time nor ingredients with her cake recipes! I decided to try her \\"heavenly chocolate cake\\" for my first effort in the book. She says it is her most requested cake, so I figured it had to be good. What a disaster! She instructs you to bake 9 inch cake pans for one hour at 350 degrees. If you do you'll end up with charcoal. It would have been nice if there had been an editor involved with a book this beautiful. What a waste. What a disappointment!
B0009MAO46|5.0|When you watch this movie the story doesn't let you care about graphics.  You get involved with the characters from the beginning.

B000068OCS|4.0|I love this film. One of the most moving works of art ever created, however the DVD transfer is underwhelming. DVD can use up to 10 MBPS. When surround sound is used up to about 9 MBPS. I work preofessionally with video (shooting/editing) and spend a fair amount of time authoring DVDs. Why they chose to stick to 3 - 5 MBPS is appalling. For those of you who do not know MBPS = Mega Bits Per Second. MBPS is similar to Megapixels (when speaking about a digital camera).  The higher the Mega Bits used per second the more information used to store thie picture and thus the higher the quality the picture will be and the better it will look. I would still recommend this DVD...only because this is as of now the best way to see the film (outside the off chance it will be shown in some art house theatre). Beware,however, it will not look great...good maybe. I can't wait until Kayaanisqatsi is remastered for Blu-ray.
B00006IU73|5.0|Simply put, PT is the greatest working band around. And it seems as if the reason is obvious: They have, over time, perfected a formula echoing the very best elements of rock music encompassing the last 30-plus years; and in the process created a joyous hybrid of Floyd, Crimson, Genesis, Rush, NIN and Tool, among others...with a trace of Fripp's solo soundscapes guitar treatment sprinkled in. By mixing this musical stew with their own unique brilliance they have filtered out the excess and effectively produced a sound that is at once excitingly original and undeniably reminiscent of the best 70's prog.     In my humble opinion \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" are the pinnacles of their work, although most all their records are great. I can't listen to one single track from the masterpiece that is \\"In Absentia\\" without automatically wanting to hear the entire CD beginning with track one, since, not only is it a concept album, but one song truly does seamlessly blend into the next; especially the first two. Anyone who loves this album knows you can't play the wonderfully-addictive \\"Blackest Eyes\\" without the gorgeous perfection that is \\"Trains\\" immediatley following it. And just TRY hitting stop after THAT. You can't do it...The tapestry and texture of this record creates nothing short of an atmospheric bliss for the ears. It is the perfect sonic balance of acoustic and electric, power and delicacy, ambience and harmony, and industrial and alternative metal. All backing the best lead-vocalist (and lyrics) in modern rock today (with the exception of Peter Gabriel, but of course SW is the best of his own generation). How this incredible band is not a house-hold name by now is beyond me. After all, they really are The Beatles of this millenium.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is by far one of the best BBC dramas I've seen.  I was disappointed when I found out it was not aired on PBS Masterpiece Theater, but I'm glad to have the DVD copy.  It's truly a classic from Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (also the author of \\"Cranford\\" and \\"Wives and Daughters\\") that shows the simple and complex dimensions of personal and societal struggle after a rural family moves from Hampshire to Milton in the north of England.      Daniela Denby-Ashe is very unwavering as the heroine, Margaret Hale.  Her performance is superb in her simplified, yet gracious manner.  Richard Armitage is also wonderful as mill owner, John Thornton.  Their on-screen chemistry is fantastic.  Most of all the series episodes are so riveting that I had to get up to put in the next DVD right away!  If you love great stories with depth and humanity, not just costume dramas, then check this one out and buy it.
141694740X|4.0|I don't go out of my way to read books about how we should and shouldn't act in the world, especially in the relationship genre because you end up either blowing it or seeing something that isn't there.  This, however, is a good self help as to why and how we end up in the messes that we tend to be in.    Unfortunately, much of who we are will not show themselves until a situation presents itself.  For example, you will not know if the person likes your friends until you introduce him to your friends.  It's a sad world we live in to know that meeting your family and friends is a true litmus test, not just of them but of the potential party before you.  Most of the time friends and family will be receptive, but I cannot tell you how many potential and even established boyfriends I have had who have broken it off after meeting my friends and family because they don't like them.  All I can say is that that's terrible.  They will disappoint you then and they will disappoint you in other situations as well.  That's why he's not that into you.    Most of this is self explanitory: If he's not that into you, he won't call or go out of his way to include your being in his world.  There is no 100% garantee that following this or any other self help guide will get the desired results.  It uses trendy language that those who watch a lot of SITC will understand.  The 90s had The Rules, then HJNTIY was the book for the 2000s.  There will be something else next decade that will start a few new catch phrases.
0316143472|4.0|By now, David Sedaris is a household name for anyone who listens to \\"This American Life\\" on NPR or reads the New Yorker religiously. I first came upon the author when my cousin read me his SantaLand Diaries. Because I do not enjoy being read to aloud, I would look over her shoulder and silently read along (which turned out to be a bit ahead), and then wait for her to get to the punchlines so that I could laugh out loud at the correct moments. The laughing out loud wasn't hard to do, but the waiting for my cousin to get there was. It was the funniest thing I had read in a good long while. I have never heard \\"This American Life,\\" but I have since read many of his essays, both in his previous works of collected essays and those that have been published in the New Yorker.<br /><br />WHILE YOU ARE ENGULFED IN FLAMES is Sedaris's sixth book, and it opens with a bang but slowly loses steam until the long essay at the end. \\"The Smoking Session\\" chronicles his quest to stop smoking after his mother dies of lung cancer. It starts off in traditional essay fashion and then concludes with diary entries --- dates and all --- for each day he is in Tokyo kicking the habit. Perhaps because addiction is such a powerful and personal topic, this is the funniest, the most intimate and the most human of the essays here.<br /><br />This is not to say that the others are devoid of humor, intimacy or humanness, for to lack such things would be completely un-Sedaris-like. But in \\"The Smoking Section,\\" where he reminisces about previously quitting drugs and alcohol, along with the present cigarettes, he is back to being Sedaris at his finest. It is almost as if this small section is the book itself and the rest of the stories are filler --- good on their own but a bit tedious side by side in book format. This may be due to the fact that many were first published elsewhere, thus they lack thematic continuity.<br /><br />These essays, however, are still worthy of merit. Those that originally appeared in the New Yorker are by far the best of that bunch, and the rest are interesting for anyone already familiar with Sedaris --- for each story is one more puzzle piece into the life of the man we feel we know. Taken as a whole, they bring comedy to everyday life and a narrative to everyday experiences. He writes of his family, his schooldays, his travels, his relationships, and all other phases of life both important and trivial --- and the trivial is made significant by its insight and irony. Sedaris kept journals before becoming a writer in the professional sense of the word, and he has truly turned his personal hobby into a unique literary endeavor that appears effortless and without fault.<br /><br />In WHEN YOU ARE ENGULFED IN FLAMES, like all previous works of his that I have read, his homosexuality doesn't come into play until the middle of the book. In this way he is a writer who just happens to be gay instead of a \\"Gay Writer.\\" As a minority writer and an advocate for gay rights, I find it refreshing that his sexuality is treated no differently than that of anyone else. Sedaris writes of his life with his boyfriend Hugh and focuses as much on their day-to-day existence as a couple as on the fact that they are two males in love. He has his coming-out stories and his in-the-closet stories, but all these are treated as no more or no less important than everything else he writes about. The result is literature that can be read by gay males but is not written specifically for gay males, and this seems to create a sense of normalcy that homosexuals of both genders often lack in this hyper homo-aware generation, which is at once friendly and phobic.<br /><br />Sedaris --- Greek, middle-class, gay, and with his own set of neuroses --- is an individual to whom we can all relate --- if not in specifics, at least in the sense of a self-conscious, second-guessing, blundering and selfish existence. He tries to be nothing other than what he is --- a human being. And for this we can't help but love him.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Shannon Luders-Manuel--- Reviewed by Shannon Luders-Manuel
B00005K3O4|5.0|As a child of the 80's, I loved this movie. Every time it came on tv, I was mesmerized. But over time I had completely forgotten about it. Then I came across it at Blockbuster and rented it just for some nostaliga. I was instantly back in love with it and my 8 yr old daughter is now obessed with it. Over the couple of days we had it, she watched it probably 20 times. She even drew pictures of scenes from the movie. The title is the plot of the movie. These very creepy clowns land on earth in their circus tent spaceship and run amok in town. Using their cotton candy ray guns to spin unspecting townspeople up in cocoons or trapping them in giant balloons. It's up to Dave, Debbie and Mike to save the town. The only actor in the movie that I recognize is the actor who plays Dave the cop, he played Hunk Golden in another great bad 80's movie \\"HUNK.\\"<br />Another thing that I like about this movie is that it's creepy, weird and funny but it's not the typcal horror movie. There almost no blood, no nudity or sex and there's no brutal violence, it's more of a comedic Beetlejuice violence which was more suitable for older children to enjoy as well.

0385340567|4.0|NOTHING TO LOSE is Lee Child's latest, and perhaps most thoughtful, Jack Reacher novel to date. In conceiving these books, Child set for himself a simple but brilliant rule: each installment in the series is effectively a stand-alone work, wholly independent of the others, with Reacher being the only unifying theme. The advantage to new readers is obvious: they can pick a book, any book, and then read the rest in any order. For longtime fans, all one has to remember is Reacher: big, capable and confident, though not unreasonably so, a wanderer who knows his own limitations.     What Child hasn't done in previous volumes --- at least explicitly --- is to reach for metaphor, which is what he does right up front in NOTHING TO LOSE. At the start of the book, Reacher is on his way to San Diego. His route takes him to Colorado, where he finds himself on a road that will lead him either to Hope or to Despair, two small towns in the middle of nowhere separated by 12 miles of empty road. Reacher chooses Despair, hoping for a meal and coffee when he gets there. What he receives is a hostile reception and an order to leave, along with his java.    Entering Hope after being summarily rejected by Despair, Reacher makes the acquaintance of Vaughn, an enigmatic female police officer who gives him the lowdown on Despair: it's a factory town, strangers are not welcome, and Reacher would be best to head out around it, or in another direction entirely. But Reacher does not like to back up and, like a tongue probing a sore tooth, begins making frequent if irregular visits to Despair --- some clandestine, some not so. It is almost as if he can't help himself, for every time he returns, he learns more --- and the more he learns, the less he knows.    Despair is owned and run by a man named Thurman, part industrialist and part preacher who just happens to control the town's only major industry, which seems to be involved in scrap metal reclamation. There is a lot, however, that does not add up. Why are the townspeople so hostile to strangers? Why does a small private plane leave town late at night after each weekday? What is really going on in that giant factory on the outskirts of Despair? And what is up with that military facility that is nearby, to no discernible purpose? Reacher gets a reluctant Officer Vaughn interested --- and not just in Despair, either --- but Vaughn has a tragic secret of her own, which gives Reacher some added impetus to see things through to an explosive end.    Child drops a couple of informative nuggets about Reacher along the way, as well as factoids about the best type of coffee cup (and why it's the best), some quick but deep philosophical dissertations (without missing a beat of the narrative) and an extremely innovative use of one of those multi-positional folding ladders. He has constructed the novel so that it's more than an adventure tale; indeed, there is a mystery at the heart of it that Reacher is able to puzzle out with equal parts logic, intuition and luck.    In a way, he also breaks tradition with what normally takes place in a Reacher story. As a general rule, there has not been much attention paid to how Reacher gets from Point A to Point B; he simply does. The opposite is true in NOTHING TO LOSE, and it may be Child's response to those who have wondered, jokingly or otherwise, how Reacher seems able to transverse distance (almost) at will during the course of a story.    Be that as it may, NOTHING TO LOSE is sure to please all Reacher fans, new and established.       --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

It's kind of like the director put a face on an earthquake, or a tidal wave, or a terrorist attack.  There was some good detail to the havoc, and when you could'nt catch a glimpse of the creature, it was like it was some kind of natural disaster--- buildings falling, people running, death, destruction, madness, and mayhem.  And then we're reminded of the creature....  I would say if you haven't seen this, give it a try-- it's worth a 3 dollar rental...

B0017I1FNK|5.0|I have been an Emmylou fan since the beginning, and I always buy her albums.  This one is amazingly gorgeous.  Usually, you get one or two uptempo footstompin' numbers, but all of these are slow beautiful dirges.  This is the perfect rainy day album.  The woman has exquisite taste in picking (or creating) her material.  The original songs are lovely, but a couple of the classics (one by Tracey Chapman, Merle Haggard's \\"Kern River\\") almost, dare I say it?, surpass the originals.  I have played the Kern River one the most and wish it had been part of the Brokeback Mountain soundtrack.  I don't think I've ever heard anything as heart-breaking as this song the way she does it.  And who else can harmonize with herself so angelically?   If one Emmylou is sublime, what can you say about three or four of them gloriously combined?   This CD is a must for anyone who likes the artistry of the classic achingly-pure Emmylou.

B0006IUDXA|4.0|One of my favorite shows, as a kid at least. It gets repetitive, but it's still fun to watch an episode or two every once in awhile. If you grew up with Macgyver as a kid, you know how great it was. It was like a 47 minute b-action movie. Sometimes nonstop action. Macgyver made a great debut in it's first season, and would go strong for years after. Season one has a few really good episodes, but my favorite by far is \\"Thief of Budapest\\". It starts out with a cold intro, meaning it doesn't have anything to do with the episode. Macgyver has to steal back a valuable horse because people may go to war over it. He has a pole vs sword duel on horses with a big mustache guy and Macgyver of course wins, and to top it off he rams his horse into a couple other guys on horses who were circling around him. Then there's something I've never seen before. A helicopter comes flying above Macgyver and has a strap attached to it which Macgyver puts on the horse and the helipcopter flies them away. Breathtaking. Then the episode actually starts. There's an amazing painful looking stunt, a bar fight, a fun car chase with a bunch of Mini Coopers going down stairs and other cool stuff, Macgyver makes out with a hot gypsy woman, he slides down a slanted roof Jackie Chan style, and they don't even use a stunt double. Such an awesome episode.<br /><br />People seem to be mad that the only way you can get the 2 TV movies is to buy the Macgyver complete series box set.  Maybe I'm just one of the few people that don't really care for the Macgyver movies.  I'm happy that I bought all of the seasons seperately.  I've seen the complete series box set and it has like 20 discs all stacked on top of eachother.  There's no way I'd pay a hundred dollars for that.

0307265730|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri's new collection of stories detail the lives of several Bengalis learning to combine their heritage with American culture. Compromise and balance are imperative when approaching the variety of issues these characters  encounter, including friendship, romantic relationships, morality, education and family values. Even seemingly minor parts of life, including dress and food, are examined, as they are very significant to the Indian identity. Generational differences are on the forefront of each story; many characters were either born in the United States or came to the country when they were young, making them identify more with the American culture they have been surrounded by.  These struggles are visible in every story, but are tailored to fit the individual characters and their lives.<br /><br />Part one of the collection is made up of five stories. My favorite was \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" in which the perspective is alternated between a newly widowed man who visits his middle-aged, pregnant daughter. She feels obligated to allow him to move in with her family (her Caucasian husband has even agreed) but is reluctant to ask. The father knows the request is coming but doesn't want to accept, content with his life of travel and new (secret) girlfriend. Over the course of his visit the two grow closer, learning more about each other in just a few days  than they had over an entire lifetime.  The other stories are also fantastic, Lahiri expertly crafting characters with depth.<br /><br />Part two consists of three stories that are connected to each other,  told by a man and a woman whose relationship goes back to childhood, when their families temporarily lived together. The three stories tell about their separate lives and how they are once again brought together as adults.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone. There's so many layers that everyone can identify with something in it, even if they're not Indian (I'm not!) Themes such as cultural identity, love and family apply to everyone. Lahiri has obviously decided to write about Bengalis; some people have a problem with this. What does it matter? The characters and their stories are fresh and insightful , and the writing is beautiful. Would we ask a surgeon to do someone's taxes? A dance instructor to run a construction crew? Probably not; let a writer write what they know, especially if they do it well!dentity, love and family apply to everyone.

They meet up with a couple of strangers that seem to be in trouble.  Gail offers to help them down the river.  But what she thought were two helpless men, turn out to be criminals and take over the family.  They have to band together to outsmart the crooks.  It is a very good movie worth watching!  It has a little of everything: humor, excitement, suspense, thrilling, and a happy ending.  Be careful having your kids watch this, though.  As the movie progresses and tensions rise, there is some minor language that makes the movie realistic.  According to kidsinmind.com, the \\"f\\" word is used only once.  All the rest are common words you would expect to hear from a regular movie.  I give it two thumbs up!!!
B0014127BO|1.0|What the heck is this anyway?  I know what it is! A boring washed up 80's singer trying to make what passes for decent music and failing miserably.  Even more bizarre, the album cover is nearly a carbon copy of Ryan Adams' worst album \\"Rock N Roll\\".  Odd.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|I didn't like reading the epic poem beowulf in school, but they adapted it into a enjoyable action flick.  All the changes they make add a lot of depth missing from the original story.  Looks great on an HDTV.
0061537934|5.0|I'm a dog lover. I'm a huge F1 racing fan. So the premise of this book was enough for me to pick it up. But this isn't a book about either. It's a story of love, loss, and triumph. I loved these people, and their story. I particularly loved Enzo. My husband (who is sooo not a reader) is currently reading it, and it may be the first fiction book he'll finish this decade, because he can't put it down. Excellent story!
0763619612|5.0|This is a great children's book.  I have read a few of this author's books and I like this one the best.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is a true phenomenon. A new musical with the potential to run for years, Wicked possesses certain qualities that distinguish itself from any other contemporary!            The biggest asset Wicked has is an amazing plot. Kudos goes to Gregory Maguire for creating the premise! Though Wicked does not follow the book, it has an intricate and enthralling plot guaranteed to bewitch you. The story of a green girl with amazing powers, Elphaba, and her very popular friend Galinda, the tale follows them through years at school and all the way until the bitter end. The most entrancing and original aspect of the plot is its novelty. Wicked takes the story we all know, and upon which many of us have been raised, and shows just how little we actually know! Before Wicked how many of us can explain the significance of the ruby slippers? Or for that matter even grant the simple kindness of giving her a name beyond \\"the witch\\"! None of us could. But Stephen Schwartz changed all that with his most remarkable musical.          Bringing me to  second point. The music. Catchy and inspiring they help craft a tone that makes Wicked both tragic and comedic. Not often can the two merge so seamlessly, and the music helps to enable this.      Third point. The lyrics. They are incredibly witty and poignant. They will reveal deep ironies and foreshadowing. I for one could spend years interpreting the lyrics and finding nuances. In the song \\"Wonderful\\" the Wizrd tells Elphaba that he really just wanted to help the people in Oz. Elphaba retaliates by accusing him of lying. In return, he tells her \\"Elphaba, where I come from people believe all sorts of things that aren't true... We call it history!\\" and then he continues on to sing about our historical hypocrisy. Though superficially light and funny, this hits on a deep and sadly true fact of life!         Fourth point. Great cast. Who doesn't love Idina and Kristin? They are both so amazing, and with beautiful voices too!     If anyone criticizes this show, they just must be unable to appreciate the nuances to it. Whether they dislike the plot, or the music, some people will always dislike every great show. I'm sure many people hate \\"South Pacific\\" too! But I think Wicked has proven it can compete and endure. In LA (near where I live) the show has cleaned out the Pantages box offices. It completely wiped out the huge record set by \\"The Producers.\\" As I write, the show runs in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Osaka, London, Melbourne, and Stuttgart. Future locations include Greensville, San Francisco, and more (Thanks to a tour!)! The show has a future that is truly \\"Unlimited\\"! With great acting, music, lyrics, and a story that could captivate any theater-lover, Wicked promises to be a major presence forever! So I will close with a selection from a Time review:  \\"If every musical had a brain, a heart, and the courage of Wicked, Broadway would really be a magical place!\\"

0312360266|4.0|This novel is targeted at teens. Maybe a little too much. Everybody looks like some movie star when they're being described. And the mind set seems to be targeting to peppy teen spirit. Personally I don't think that way, and I pity anyone who does. Heck I don't even think the most peppiest cheerleader thinks that way, but hey what do I know.     So it was safe to say when I started reading this book I was annoyed. In fact I thought about quitting. I put the book aside and walked away. Two seconds later I came back franatically searched for my spot and continued reading. Even though the it rubbed me the wrong way, like I might be reading a teen gossip book and this was a trap, I had to finish. This book just grips you, making you have to go and buy everything you can.     The book is really fun mixing those girly fantasy dreams and vampire fun in one. You know the escaping from home to some magical place, or transforming into something that can fly. Instead, of course, this is different but it reminisce those good little fantasy times. Except the world has always lived with vampires, when you are marked by vampire you go to a school and can be turned.    The process of course goes to a certain age (which I'm pretty sure isn't set? Or is it eighteen?) until they can become a real vampire, but the effects start before the turning. The vampire anarchy is really well done. Vampires who think their special and superior, the pacifists, the lowly treated vamps, and the fearing people. It's nice that the authors can build the story nicely and make it believable. Mixing history and myths together.     Though it is tiring in the story when the main character is the chosen one. And everything falls right into their laps. Great power, really no work, just have to get past the resenting teenager, and maybe a sneaky adult in the future. She has the friends which is always a plus. But she gets the boyfriend, power, station, and special sticker-star with out a blink. A little annoying but doesn't hurt the novel to much.     I think what was really well done is that the authors emphasis that not everyone can make it to being a full fledged vamp. And that if you don't you die. The weight was nicely put on so that you could believe it, but the kids could still keep going with that teenage mind set. `It could happen to me, but hey maybe not.'    **** So in the end the novel is a good read. Fast paced and gripping. Some of the material may offend readers. Sex is emphasized, but this is a vampire book, that's part of their nature. The teen targeting may annoy others, maybe even stop them from enjoying the book. But it's still a good read. A new vision in the vampire/urban fantasy genre. Surely something to look into. Hey you may even enjoy the vampire and girly-power-fantasy all in one.
B0012Q732O|3.0|A great movie will hold you as soon as it starts with its music, introduction of characters and story and will not let you go till it<br />ends.  This movie tries but did not succeed very good. It had the ideas<br />but could not exploit them sucessfully... Due to the lack of violence that<br />comes with the territory of taking slaves...it almost feels like it ready<br />to be shown on family TV...and most of them talk like they are too educated to be in 10,0000 BC.<br />Good for a view......
0345472322|5.0|I first read about Dweck and her research in a NYT article on child development. This is the dose of reality that we all need after years of \\"positive thinking\\" mantras. Without responsibility, action and growth-orientation, we block the positive path and fail to realize our potential. This book hammers the points home with detailed anecdotes from business, sports and general society.. plus the research that backs it up is solid.
B0001XALTG|2.0|There are 2 to 3 moments of humor in this film and 2 to 3 moments of brutal reality.  Otherwise, it's far too disjointed and muddled to rate any higher than two stars.  Basically shows the depressing and pathetic lives of severe heroin addicts and how difficult it is to quit using.  Unless you've been living under a rock, you essentially know heroin is dangerous, addicting, and difficult to quit. No new material here folks.  \\"Traffic\\" has nailed this plague far better.
B000W4KT64|4.0|I've put off watching this movie because I had caught snippets of the '88 version years ago was never impressed enough to watch the whole thing.  I might do so now to compare.  I found this version fresh and fun and even a little inspiring.  And even though I can respect John Travolta for being a actor's actor-a man who even over 30 years in the biz willing to take some serious risk, I pray that he will now please step away from dresses and high heels.  I easily found him to be the weakest singer of the lot and his makeup more disturbing than anything else.  That was my only gripe.  I love the music and the message.  I also think Michelle Pfeiffer is just stunning and Christopher Walken as funny as always.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|I think the problem many people have with this film is that - unlike most moralizing Hollywood movies - it doesn't take a stand for or against smoking. While I think smoking is disgusting and practically crazy and I've lost count of the people I've known who died from it, I actually found this approach refreshing. It's essentially a cynical, amoral, libertarian satire on the American nanny state, corporate shills, and posturing politicians. In essence it boils down to this message: \\"Everyone's got a selfish reason for doing what they do and all information is skewed to the interests of the person providing it. Make up your own mind based on that. If you can.\\"<br /><br />Since I'm neither amoral or libertarian I was not thrilled with the main character (His motto: \\"If you argue correctly, then you're never wrong.\\") or with the way he indoctrinated his son into believing \\"doing what you do best\\" is one's highest calling - even if it's for a damnable cause. But his blunt honesty appealed to my cynical side and was often quite amusing.
B000ZN802W|1.0|Heard so much about this movie, not that's time spent I can never get back.    I know many people consider this a great spiritual journey, and I'll get blasted for \\"not getting it.\\"  But I found the main character naive unrealistic in his views.  Unfortunately he paid the ultimate price for his lack of understanding.
0743290119|2.0|Touted by the publisher marketing department as \\"Sex and the City-eque\\", it turns out that is a very accurate description of Chasing Harry Winston, Lauren Weisberger's newest offering to the literary world and follow up novel to her major best seller The Devil Wears Prada. As someone who devoured The Devil Wears Prada the first time and then went back for second and third helpings over the years, you could definitely say I am a fan of Ms. Weisberger's work. Unfortunately Chasing Harry Winston hits a little too close to Sex and the City (SATC) for this reader. The three main characters can be drawn directly to the cast of SATC, minus Carrie Bradshaw (and who wants a SATC that's minus Carrie Bradshaw?) The result is a pretty formulaic and predictable story line. There were bright spots of banter, bonding and some downright sensible advice for the capturing and releasing of men, but overall this novel falls right into the marketing department's promotional \\"Beach Read of 2008\\" to be forgotten about come September. Overall the novel is a fast read, designer names sprinkled in here and there to give it that glamorous feel and while I do heart SATC, seeing a diluted version of it print is like drinking a watered-down cosmopolitan. However, it delivers what it promises, young Manhattanites trying to make the most of who they are and what they have to give, leaning on each other for support and learning to be happy for one another. Bonus points for a cover that couldn't be more fabulous if it tried!
B00003CXD0|5.0|Dustin Hoffman is hilarious as an actor doing what he needs to do to get the job and the girl.For a few moments you forget he's a he.Sidney Pollack doesnt miss a heart beat in this family type comedy.Definately a movie to watch over and over.Glad its now in my library of best movies.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I enjoy Coldplay generally and this record is no different in that I like it.    It is different in that it is not quite the same songwriting, which to me is a plus.  I enjoy having bands change and grow.   The songs are still strong, but not the same as earlier works.    And Eno does a great production job (some people may like his style, others may not, I enjoy how he does his job.)    If you are a fan of Coldplay and pick this up you may not intiially like it due to the differences.  If that is your initial reaction, do yourself a favor, listen a few more times but not in one sitting.  Come back now and again and then you will be able to hear the record for what it is, very good.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought both the Charming Pastel and the Darling versions for my 1 and 3 year olds.  Both love them and they've quickly become favorites.  They smell great and are a great size -- perfect for cuddling and sleeping.  We have both larger and smaller dolls, and the 12\\" seems great for carrying around.  My older daughters likes to watch the eyes move when the baby is \\"awake\\" (up) and \\"night night\\" (laying down).      The only downside is that neither doll can hold a bottle or pacifier in their mouths.  Although you can get these accessories, your child can only pretend to use them....  unlike other dolls where the pacifier \\"sticks\\" in the mouth and stays.  This doesn't seem to bother my older daughter, but my younger one really likes to put the bottle in the mouth of another baby.      The doll bed accessory is really nice and the diaper bag is perfect for carrying around the accessories.  My older daughter likes being able to pack her stuff inside it and sling it over her shoulder.      Very cute dolls.  Highly recommended.     I checked around for other pricing.  Runs about $[...] at [...] and elsewhere.  I've seen it for $[...] here on amazon -- which is just silly.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I bought this cd for my son because he loves The Wall so much. I just knew he would like it and I was right he plays it ALL the time.
B000002HMH|5.0|I've been listening to Metallica for 20 years now and have to say that Load has grown on me over the years; \\"The Bleeding of Me\\" in particular pretty much sums up a man's struggle with work and life - something that I couldn't have identified with back then. The album is mature and worth a good listen to. If you want thrash, listen to the early albums if you want to listen to a maturing band this is a great example of their work in the pre-Trujillo era.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I wanted to share this movie with my son who loves The Wall audio cd. He seems to appreciate it.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|Great premise. Great cast. Nice atmosphere, suspense and effects. Extremely cool sun. Pity they threw it all away at the end. Just when it ought to get really interesting, they shrug and turn it into a cheap, predictable horror flick. What a waste of talent!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Now I know that we all react to entertainment/art on a very emotional level, and perhaps I was just emotionally 'insync' with the writer/director (usually a really bad sign..) of this movie. It is honest, poignant, well-written, very well filmed (the surfing scenes.. on a budget of 500k?), and extremly well-acted. And Trevor Wright... he is in virtually every scene and he never disappoints. Tina Holmes is totally convincing. Yes, it's a 'gay' movie, but your mom would puddle too! Please check it out! BTW -- listen to Shane Mack's songs ('Lie to Me') in this movie (the soundtrack is a great Amazon.com download). He's a breakout artist, I predict!
B0012Q732O|4.0|Well it seems I am in the minority but I enjoyed this movie. As another reviewer said, it throws history off but so what. It was a fun movie with a rather interesting story. I thought the actors were great and the filming very well done. I think if you can take it for what it is, and just enjoy the story in the movie rather than comparing it to history then you'll enjoy it.
0440236738|5.0|I didn't think that Coben would be able to top his work from Tell No One, but he did.  The plot in this one was even more complex and you had just as much invested in the main character.  You really felt like you got to know Will and the pain he went through.  Coben used a very similar formula in this book as he did in Tell No One and The Innocent, but it's a great one.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it is certainly one of the most engrossing and thrilling books I have ever read.  Well done Sir, again.
B0013FXWX8|5.0|This has so many Asian elements that you will simply be attracted to it, whoever you are. Haven't seen a good one like this in a long time.  Amazing music and picture art. Good story. Great action scenes. Thoughtful lines. Simple fun!!!
B000053VAF|5.0|Thanks to Kevin Smith and a lot of acting talent, this movie is number 1 on my movie list: my all-time favorite. Eventually, I'm sure I'll have every movie that Smith has created. His dialogue is so far above everyone else, that alone should recommend any movie this man does.<br /><br />I fell in love with Clerks and Clerks II, but this!  First off, how much better than Alan Rickman as one of the stars can you get?  Followed by Matt Damon as \\"Loki\\"  and Ben Afflick as \\"Bartleby\\", then of course Jay & Silent Bob doing their usual schtick (not great actors, but totally amusing are Jay and partner). The little demons were a bit scary -- vicious children generally are. I love George Carlin as a stand-up commedian, but as an actor, I can do without him. Linda Fiorentino played the last Zion, or last living person related to Jesus, who is understandably reluctant to go on this crusade against the two fallen angels.  The storyline holds together, the characters are fun and the film itself a definate attention holder.<br /><br />By the way, I also really like the loyalty Kevin Smith shows to the people he works with: if you watch closely you'll see the two \\"Clerks\\" somewhere here.<br /><br />I'd recommend buying, borrowing, renting, whatever it takes for you to see this movie. If you're easily offended via religion or if you have no sense of humor about religion, perhaps this isn't the one for you. Otherwise, enjoy.
006085880X|5.0|If you're looking for a real page-turner to get lost in, this book definitely delivers.  I could not put it down!  The first Picoult book I read was My Sisters Keeper.  It was absolutely amazing, so I had high hopes for this book by the same author.  Words can't even begin to express how interesting and gripping this book was for me.  I've been obsessed with reading it since I first picked it up.  Now that I'm finished with it, I can't praise it enough.  Picoult is an excellent writer and doesn't disappoint.
B0015GDVY0|5.0|Gerard Butler is a living dream in more ways than one. While Hilary Swank wouldn't have been first choice as female romantic lead, she has some very poignant and comical moments. But this is Gerard Butler's film and he is sweet, and funny, and ideal.
B00003CXAT|5.0|When I was a kid, I watched \\"Jaws\\" with my family. Since then, i have become terrified of sharks and swimming in the ocean. I also watched \\"Jurassic Park\\" when I was little with my sister, and my sister has never gotten over her fear of dinosaurs, despite the fact that they're extinct! While the dinos didn't scare me, I couldn't help but be amazed by this movie. Stephen Spielberg created the ultimate thrill ride when he made this movie. In my opinion, almost everything about the film is perfect. Many people have said the plot was weak, but if you compare it to a lot of other blockbusters gracing the screen today it holds up pretty well. The special effects also hold up perfectly, especially when you compare it to Spielberg's recent film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (now those were bad effects). The dinosaurs still look pretty realistic. My favorite thing about Jurassic Park is the suspense throughout the movie. Without a doubt, my favorite scene is the first T-Rex scene. It starts off with the goat disappearing, then the water in the footprints start to shake and...well, you know what happens. Though other sequels followed, to me there will be nothing better than the first one: Welcome to Jurassic Park!
B00000K0EA|3.0|As much as Pierce Brosnan is a favorite actor, pairing him with Terri Hatcher was not a great choice. Watch it for Jonathon Pryce, who is brilliant as the villian, and Dame Judy Dench as the perfect M.
0786838655|5.0|I was amazed at the author's ideas in this book.  Interesting details that really fit in the book not like some other books that have boring details that don't matter and don't mean anything.  I am at a loss of how to express how great this book was.  No words that come to mind seem to be good enough.  READ THIS BOOK!  I started the 2nd book \\"The Sea of Monsters\\" the next day.  Can't wait to see the exciting twists and turns Percy goes through next.
B000TGGJKK|4.0|I previously owned the HD DVD copy of this epic but traded it when I heard that there would be a Directors Cut which would be an improvement on the previous one as far as the video. If you're a fan of this film as I was, then I would recommend this epic whole-heartedly. Some of the dialogue is a little too contemporary for a film of this type and Diane Kruger seems somewhat wooded as Helen but a great beauty nevertheless but Pitt and Eric Bana do excel as the rivals in the war and they're supported by a fine cast of veteran actors such as Brian Cox & the great Peter O'Toole.  This film doesn't quite fall in the classic status like \\"Gladiator\\" but nevertheless Wolfgang Petersen has delivered an enjoyable, entertaining epic with awesome battle scenes that DeMille would be proud of.  Definitely a must if you have a HDTV that is 50\\" or more!!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is definately a film that you will want in your collection, because it is worth watching more than once. It is much like a good book that you do not want to end because you want to see what happens next. This was a heart warming movie for me. Great acting, editing and sound. Excellent music too.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I first saw this thought-provoking film on the big screen in 70mm and believed it to be one of the best films of the 80's.  Unfortunately the film opened to disappointing business in the U.S. but did much better in Europe (It received a Golden Palm at Cannes).  DeNiro and Irons each give excellent performances of 2 men caught in conflict over the problems of church vs state in the colonization of the tribes in the Americas.  Many people thought this to be a religious film but it is far more than that. Rather to divulge a lot about the plot, I would rather imply that this film is a triumph in the sense that it is action filled spectacle that makes us think rather than just entertain us. It's too bad that director Roland Joffe has descended nowadays to doing a slasher film with an American actress (Elisha Cuthbert).  Anyway do see this film for the direction, the stars and of course, the evocative score by Ennio Morricone who should've won the Oscar that year. By the way, Warners has finally decided to release this film in Blu-Ray in October--and I will definitely order it. A footnote is that DeNiro trained extensively (fencing, dialect) for this film and was his only film in 1986!!  Well to update this a bit, I do have it in Blu-ray but am a little peeved at Warners since they've edited an action scene with DeNiro facing off the enemies--why do they do this continually like they did with another DeNiro flick--\\"Heat\\"? Though the transfer is superb, the sound is a little disappointing, it lacks the spaciousness of how it was in the theater.  Outside of these complaints, still worth owning.
B000NA28IE|1.0|If you've never read the book this movie makes an O.K fantasy at best for little kids. If you have read the book it stinks. They cut out so much from the book.They did a horrible job at developing the characters. The author writes very detailed descriptions of the characters. Could the directors at least try to stick to it?! In a hope to keep it a PG movie they cut out all the action also.Instead it looks like they threw everything together just to make a quick buck leaving out the heart of the story.I would easily watch a 2-3 hour movie! Instead you end up with a cheesy movie, bad lines, and nothing to make it original. If they make a second they'll be hard-pressed to make it work since they cut out everything essential for the next.   BOTTOM LINE:DON'T GET IT!
B000ULPFGS|3.0|This film proven to be a hit at the box office for filmmaker Spike Lee. I usually avoid his films like the plague since I've grown tired of his preaching on race and the ills of this country but for once, he has delivered a solid, entertaining movie.  The cast, for starters, is excellent. Denzil Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Plummer & Chiwetel Ejiotor really deliver the goods in this slick heist movie.  Seemingly a heist film, this film is more than that and thank god, Lee steers away from his political preaching.  If you've avoided his films in the past, do check this one out--you'll probably like it.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I wasn't planning on watching this movie.  Another animated feature film for the kiddies, a ton of good reviews, ho-hum.  Well, this past weekend, I decided to check Rottentomatoes, a movie website that tallies the average of over a hundred critical reviews and gives a percentage: Iron Man got a 93% (excellent!).  Wall-E got 97%!   Ok, so maybe I should see it.  I went with my brother, and sat in a crowded theater with more  kids than adults.  Wow, was I blown away!  Yes, the visual effects and animation were state of the art, but we've come to expect that.   What I couldn't foresee was how human the animated robotic protagonists were, and how well-told the story is.  The litmus test of a great children's movie seems to be that it is very appealing to adults, that adults leave the theater, drive home, and talk about it with their friends and family.  This movie is one grown-ups will love, quite possibly the first children's animated movie that adults will admire even more than their kids.  It is THAT good!  And the romance between the two lovable robots will set a standard that most live action movies with a romantic theme wish they can achieve.      This is a great environmental movie too, one that Al Gore \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" doesn't come close to matching.  Imagine this, a children's animated movie that's truly hilarious, sad, thoughtful and heartbreaking, mature, romantic, and with a social conscience that doesn't pander.  One of the best movies I've ever seen.  Five stars isn't enough for a film that brought tears to the eyes of a few full-grown men (mine included, ok, I admit it!)  You must see this film in a crowded theater, and watch for the applause at the end from the audience.
1932907009|5.0|After spending enormous amounts of time in the screenwriting section of many bookstores and libraries, Save the Cat was the first book I came across that I actually found helpful! Most of the books I had tried before that droned on and one about the basics of how to write a story. These other books assumed that I didn't know what an antagonist or protagonist was. I wanted a book that went beyond \\"teaching me to write\\" and instead helped make my writing better - and this is exactly what Save the Cat did!    This book takes a look at structure, but also at loglines and subject matter - things that could not be found in other books. The tone of the book is probably it's strongest point - Blake Snyder writes as if he's talking directly to you, like he really cares about helping you as a writer. The rules and structure guidlines are helpful and down to earth instead of reading like a textbook.    This is a book that I have read more than once. When I feel blocked or in need of inspiration, I read a couple of chapters in order to wake up my imagination. The chapter on loglines is a great place to start and come back to if you feel that there's something majorly flawed with your story that you just can't quite pinpoint.    While I used this book to improve my writing, it is set-up to so that beginning writers can also benefit from it. A friend of mine has a kernel of an idea for a story, but he's not sure where to go next and the first thought that came to my mind was to recommend this book to him.    So, if you're looking to write a screenplay, finish a screenplay, or even take your screenplay to that next level, Blake Snyder's Save the Cat is definitely something worth investing in!
B000641Z90|5.0|This DVD-set is awesome. Ok, Phil is slowly getting old - but the music and the recording quality (both audio and video) are top notch. Believe me. I own several Concert DVD's from other bands. The audio quality on this one is unsurpassed. The song selection will please long time fans and those who are not. I totally recommend it<br />My rating  5+
0316067601|5.0|Fabulous,fabulous book. Couldn't put it down. Truly shows how our country's Rules Of Engagement costs our dedicated warriors their lives and someday may cause our own.
0805047905|5.0|I started reading this book to my son when he was only a few months old.  He is two now and still loves it.  Great rhyming and colors.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|I know many fellow Bond fans disagree, but I always thought \\"[[ASIN:B000M53GNG Thunderball]]\\" was the weakest of Connery's Bond movies. So, it was the perfect candidate for a remake, and for copyright reasons, that's just what Never Say Never Again is. And it's a welcome return for Connery as Bond.     Being made by different producers, the movie doesn't have the classic gun barrel sequence or the Maurice Binder opening credits, but it still feels like a bona fide James Bond movie, much thanks to great locations, fun gadgets and Klaus Maria Brandauer's great villain.     My main problem with Thunderball is the sleep inducing underwater sequences. Even though this movie is just as long as Thunderball, the underwater sequences are shorter, and there's more excitement before the climactic scenes (I actually enjoyed the admittedly very dated video game scene).     So I'm going to be blasphemous and say I actually enjoy this movie more than Thunderball. It's a fun movie, and a must see for all Bond fans.
0241003008|5.0|My parents read tons of books to me when I was little, but I remember this one was my favorite.  Of course I bought it for my daughter who, hopefully, will enjoy it when she gets a little older!  I always give this one as a baby present- it's a classic.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I was really excited to hear that Shinedown had a new album coming out. I loved their first album \\"Leave a Whisper.\\" Their second out \\"Us and Them\\" was not as good as their first in my opinion, it was a good album but it seemed like they went more mainstream and were forcing the music a little bit. Then they went through line-up changes and that worried me at first but know that I have listened to this album, those worries are completely gone. I fell in love with it the first time I heard it. It is no holding back in your face rock music. Some of the songs remind me more of \\"Leave a Whisper\\" Brent's vocals are stronger than ever in my opinion. Especially on \\"Call Me,\\" that song is absolutely haunting and beautiful. The first time I heard \\"Devour\\"I was like OMG this is incredible. It sounded like a different Shinedown and I liked it. I can't tell you what my favorite song is right now because I love all of them! This album should be one fo the better albums of the year and should have  at least 4-5 big singles hit the charts in my opinion. With the exception of Devour; Crow and the Butterfly, If you only Knew, What a Shame, Breaking Inside and Call Me, I believe all have the chance of being hit songs. Great songs, great album, great band!!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is a surprisingly good film. It's touching, humorous, imaginative and quite subversive. Something you don't see too often in a children's film!<br /><br />I think this brilliant film makes three very important points. First, robots will someday become sentient (self-aware) akin to Data from  Star Trek or Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey. What makes Wall-E so interesting is that a simple maintenance robot becomes self-aware,  unlike Hal or Data, which are the most advanced technology known within their  respective worlds. Granted, Wall-E's sentience took place over a 700 year period, but it makes one think if someday this could happen in the real world!<br /><br />Another important insight is the current plague of obesity Americans and many other technologically advanced nations are facing. What I found so fascinating was how, taken to an extreme, the \\"Couch Potato\\" lifestyle would play out in human evolution. Amazingly, humans were literally losing the ability to walk! The toes were even starting to disappear! If machines do all the manual labor, nothing will be left for us to do but engage in shallow conversation over a television-like screen while  eating liquid fast food!<br /><br />What brilliant satire! The message is clear! People need to get outdoors more often and enjoy life. Get off the computer, shut off the T.V. and leave your Cell Phone in the glove compartment! Don't let technology rule your life or make you sick!<br /><br />But I save the best to last! Wall-E is first, and foremost, a cautionary tale about wrecking the environment. Through the eyes of an adult,  I found this film to be profoundly sobering.  In Wall-E's world the Consumer Culture  has literally consumed the planet making it uninhabitable. People were so focused on a throw-away economy and vapid entertainment, eventually nothing was left  except one sentient  maintenance robot struggling to find a purpose. The stupidity and ugliness  of the human race is juxtaposed by the beauty of Wall-E's determination to enjoy his existence.<br /><br />What an amazing and poignant story! My hats off to Pixar for attempting to warn us about sustainable living and protecting the environment in the process!<br /><br />If I could recommend one book, which I actually finished the day before I saw Wall-E it's:  [[ASIN:0312427905 The World Without Us]].  I consider this book to be one of  the best non-fiction books I have read in my entire life. I can't recommend it highly enough!<br /><br />For other great Science Fiction see:[[ASIN:B000059HAE Zardoz]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]] and [[ASIN:B000TZN7KQ Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]y his existence.

0375842209|5.0|The title of this book, while apt, does not convey the scope, universality, or profundity of the material.  Mr. Zukas writes in a very fluid, descriptive style, which I often found poetic and unexpected.  The Holocaust has been the subject of many novels but this one is written from a different perspective.  The humanity, bravery, selflessness and inidividualtiy,  is sharply contrasted with the cruelty, cowardice, guilt, and pack mentality on both sides.  I found this story, although fairly long, to be an engrossing, quick read, especially from the first third to the end.  Highly, highly recommended!!
B0013527I4|5.0|Wow!  What can I say.  The Muppet Show was my first favorite television program and will forever be associated with great memories of hanging out with my parents, just laughing and having a good time.  My immediate memories of the show were hazy from time, but I was really surprised at how much of this stuff I remembered and the overwhelming sense of familiarity I have with the show.  It's like seeing an old friend after years apart and not missing a beat -- there's no need to catch up because everything that was once there still is!    So funny, so creative, so groundbreaking, so great.    I highly recommend checking out these DVD sets.  If you are unfamiliar with the series, you will certainly be pleased.  And if it's been awhile since you last checked in with the Muppets, your old friends are just as great as you remember.    And to tide you over while waiting for your  order to arrive, here's a taste of what the Muppets are up to today:    [...]
0765357151|3.0|I bought this book based on the enthusiastically positive reviews here on Amazon, but I'm a bit disappointed. Some of the reviews said the book was far better than the Will Smith movie, so I was expecting something really deep and engaging. Instead, I felt the story \\"I Am Legend\\" had plot weaknesses and didn't hold my interest like I expected. There were a number of times when I thought, \\"But what if...?\\" or \\"Why didn't this happen...?\\" Some Amazon reviews even said the story's ending was far superior to the ending of the Will Smith movie, but I feel like I must have read the wrong book. The end of the story was anticlimactic and didn't seem to wrap up the meaning of the title at all for me.<br /><br />I picked up the book because I enjoy sci fi, but I didn't feel this book was sci fi. It feels more like horror, and not just because of the vampires. Nearly everything about the story made it feel more like a horror story, and I'm not a fan of horror so I didn't enjoy it much. There are also several short stories following \\"I Am Legend\\" in this book (which aren't mentioned anywhere on the covers) and they are all horror genre stories. I read most of them but they just aren't my cup of tea.<br /><br />One thing I noticed is that all the stories, including \\"I Am Legend,\\" remind me of Stephen King's works. Obviously Matheson influenced King. If you enjoy Stephen King, then you'll probably really like this collection of Matheson's stories. But if you're mostly a sci fi fan like me, you may not enjoy it so much. I suspect the glowing reviews of this book are from fans of horror who maybe would have liked the movie \\"I Am Legend\\" to more closely resemble a horror movie than a sci fi flick.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|When i decided to buy the Complete Series i read all the reviews and i got confused.  I decided to buy it anyways and it was the best thing a did. I just love it...
0446618306|5.0|First I will say that I really loved this book.  I read it in one day because I could not put it down.  It was such a touching love story and I cried a lot while reading this book.    I was impressed with this one because I find that most of Nicholas Sparks' novels seem to almost follow a pattern and can sometimes be predictable.  But this one surprised me by how good it was and how well it kept me captivated and wanting more.    I was worried as I was reading it because the author covered such a large span of time without much detail and that can sometimes ruin a book.  But not this one.  It was very well written and easy to follow a long with.    It was mentioned in other reviews how well the author pinpointed what love really is and I completely agree with that.  Both love for family and love for a significant other.  The love in this book was genuine and the relationships were relatable.  And it showed that not all love stories are happy endings and that in itself was more realistic to me than the fluffy 'happily ever after' stuff that most love stories are.     And being about a soldier especially touched me, as I am an Army wife, and have known quite a few men who have gotten the 'dear John' letter.  And it is sad.  Sad, but real.    Very good read.  I recommend this one to anyone looking for a great love story.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|Beatty was perhaps a little old to be cast as John Reed, but his empathy  for the character made up for it(and Beatty is, afterall, one of the  ageless, Dick Clark-types).    Few actors could be better suited to their respective roles than Jack  Nicholson as Eugene O'Neill, and Maureen Stapleton as Emma Goldman.    If I had one wish for the movie, it would be for a bit more on the tragic  life of Louise Bryant after Reed's death.    Much of the screenplay's depiction of Reed's thinking while in Russia was  necessarily speculative, and, indeed apocryphal, but nevertheless fairly  sound, in my opinion.    It deserved an Oscar, but was, alas, upstaged by On Golden Pond that year  (which also deserved an Oscar).
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I hate it when hollywood weirdos take a good book or movie and remake them in their own weird image.  The book by Roald Dahl and the original movie starring Gene Wilder are wonderful.  This movie does not follow the story and is scary to little kids.  Basically, Mr. Wonka is a mental case who was abused by his scary dentist father. Avoid this.
B00006AW2L|4.0|This is classic Stones before they assaulted us with garbage like Sympathy  For The Devil, and, well, virtually anything after 1970.
B000007WNN|5.0|I had bought this on Cd years ago and lent it to a friend who then dissapeared so I never got it back. Over the years I have been wanting to get it again on CD. I ordered it from Amazon, got it and have been listening to it ever since. I like to listen to it on my way to work because it is one of those CD's that makes you want to get up and MOVE!
B0012Q732O|2.0|I was very disapointed in this film. I waited until it's release to DVD to see it and was disappointed how little CGI there was. I felt it was based on the foundation of one families difficulty in daily living. I expected it to be more broad of a scope beings it's title says \\"10,000 BC\\". There were more than them around and a lot more animals, volcano's, sea life... etc.
B0018S6YOE|4.0|The real fans purchase the albums in the first few weeks of their release & 6 months down the track the casual fans get expanded (better) editions. The record companies are trying to get money out of the fans twice for just a little bit of extra content. Every one feels sorry for the record companies with all this illegal downloading going on at the moment. Why should we feel sorry for them when they are ripping off the real fans. Someone mentioned that we should purchase the 3 extra tracks on mp3. RUBBISH. It would be only fair that these extra tracks should be available free for download even if it meant somehow proving that you purchased the inferior release. I'm sure 6 months down the track there will be an expanded version of Usher's new CD like there were for his last 2 CDs. Chris Brown, Fergie etc are all releasing expanded versions. It wouldn't bother me if the record companies released both an expanded & standard version at the same time, but they don't. Anyway this CD is really good. Love the Maroon 5 duet.<br />To the CD companies. A big fat GET STUFT!
0385340567|1.0|Lee Child has ruined his hero, Jack Reacher, by using the character to express political views against our present military, our leaders and consequently our country.  I enjoyed the previous eleven books by Lee Child so very much, that this is a huge disappointment.  I don't know if Reacher's strength and patriotism can ever be recovered after this novel.
B0002I831S|5.0|I forgot how good these shows really were.      It is really enjoyable to watch the shows in the order in which they originally appeared and see the characters as they develop -- see how the actors worked their way into their roles and got comfortable with them.  The fact that I have read so many books by cast members, crew, and fans only deepens the enjoyment I get from watching these shows.    What made the original Star Trek series great were the scripts and the acting -- something you don't see done well too often on television today.  This really comes out when you can watch the shows without commercial interruption in the original sequence in which they were aired.    Long live Star Trek!
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Seasons 1 and 2 both have an underlying thread throughout the entire season, where as season 3 had two or three such threads. When I first saw this season on TV, I remember thinking this was the one thing that let it down.    However, rewatching it on DVD, I just didn't get that feeling this time round. Maybe because as I watched Veronica, her father, her friends and the cool cases she always worked on, I knew this would be the last of VM. CW really blew it cancelling VM and I'm glad I now have all three seasons on DVD.    But it would be nice to know what happened to her after season three.
0061537934|5.0|I read this book in one day.  Amazing for all dog or animal lovers.  Cried, laughed, sighed,and gasped.   The ending was very satisfying!  Would highly reccomend to anyone wanting a good, easy read
B0013J30W2|4.0|A true summertime action flick wastes no time pumping adrenaline onto the movie screen, amping the intensity until viewers are grabbing their armrests with white-knuckled anticipation.  \\"Wanted\\" is that type of film.<br /><br />  Wesley Gibson, our protagonist, is an accountant with an anxiety disorder tormented by an overbearing boss, a nagging and unfaithful girlfriend and a buddy who spends more 'recreational' time with his girlfriend that Wesley does.  Entering suddenly into his unbearable life is the mysterious and appropriately named Fox (Angelina Jolie), a woman who saves Gibson's life from a killer and explains to him that she knew his father, who is now dead.  She takes the bewildered young man to Sloan (Morgan Freeman), her superior, and her cohorts, a group of elite killers called 'the fraternity' of which Gibson's father belonged to.  With Fox as his mentor, Wesley is trained to become his father's predecessor and take out the man who murdered him.<br /><br />  Russian director, Timur Bekmambetov, revs up the intensity from the beginning of the movie and never lets up.  He has an amazing eye for action sequences and truly takes the viewers for a fun-filled rollercoaster ride.  McAvoy does a good job as the accountant-turned-killer trying to deal with the abrupt change in his life and the new role that destiny offers him.  Jolie, as usual, captivates the screen, vamping it up in the kind of role she is well suited for.  Morgan Freeman, too, delivers the goods as the mastermind behind the fraternity.  While the movie is not perfect, this kind of film really isn't meant to be.  I will say, however, that one sequence (which I won't give away) is bound to infuriate animal activists---when Wesley uses a trojan horse type of secret weapon to surprise the bad buys.  It wouldn't surprise me to hear some protests of the film because of this scene and I will admit that is one aspect of the story I could have done without.<br /><br />\\"Wanted\\" is a summer popcorn movie, intended to entertain instead of provoke thought.  So, take some friends, kick back and enjoy the sheer velocity of the film.  Recommend for those who enjoy high speed action...however, there is a good deal of blood and violence.  The film is R rated and some may find the killings and gore over the top.tended to entertain instead of provoke thought.  So, take some friends, kick back and enjoy the sheer velocity of the film.

B000006OS2|1.0|This movie is my family's favorite. I have been watching it since I was born and can practically quote it line for line. However here is a word to the wise: DO NOT BUY THE UNAUTHORIZED VERSION. It will ruin it for you if you have not seen it before, and gravely disappoint you if you have. The unauthorized version is a waste of $10, or however much you paid for it.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|What a great show! This is how it should be done.... REMEMBER, if you don't buy this, then you are saying that you don't want the producers to continue making the show......<br /><br />YOU MUST SHOW YOUR SUPPORT!!!!! I highly recommend this awesome addition to the TERMINATOR universe.... it is AWESOME!! AND most importantly, it's great fun and very entertaining.....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that others haven't?<br /><br />This show is the *BEST* television.<br />I am familiar with Joss Whedon's work from his comic books, and that got me interested in Firefly.<br />What a treat.<br /><br />The episodes are something that everyone in my vanpool has seen and occasionally someone in the van will says \\"remember that time on 'firefly' when.....\\" and we'll all nod and laugh and come up with some new scene to reminisce about.<br /><br />Really it is  THAT good.  Better than Roots, Winds of War, Shogun, 24, etc. and pretty damn close to Band of Brothers, Deadwood, etc.<br /><br />You would be doing yourself a great injustice to miss this one.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Look, all I require of Madonna is to make me wanna dance.  I go the gym fairly regularly, and I get tired of listening to the same stuff.  I need someone to make me wanna shake my booty while my feet are thump-thumping on the treadmill.<br /><br />This album does it.  I was a little weary, as \\"Confessions on a Dance Florr\\" failed to earn its money back.  \\"Confessions\\" was OK for the first day or two, but then I quickly tired of its beats.  Hard Candy has kept me rockin since the day it arrived via mail (I'd pre-ordered it).  My favorite?  \\"Incredible\\" which just has an incredibly happy beat.<br /><br />The only downers are \\"Miles Away\\" and \\"Spanish Lesson\\" which feel entirely too trite and a little too 15-year-old-talking-about-her-boyfriend.  At some point, Madonna just needs to be too old to talk about that crap.<br /><br />But she should never be too old to shake her romp, and if you're looking for an album to make you want to shake yours, this one will do it.<br /><br />Recommended.

0385340567|1.0|Child's overreached.  He's apparently confident enough in this series' success that he allows Reacher to express anti-Bush, anti-Iraq war sentiments--which of course are Child's.    I've read all the Reachers and liked them--up until this one.  If I were Child, I would have kept the main character apolitical.  I hate it when a character I've been comfortable with becomes, out of nowhere, an advocate for one side or the other.  Left or right, it doesn't matter.  I didn't want to know Reacher's politics.  Now I do, and I'm less interested in the character.    So Child got something off his chest.  Hope it was worth it to him to lose readers.
0446577391|5.0|This is by far the best of the Camel Club series.  It's a fun, fast paced action thriller.  I love the building up of the different story until the final climax.  I would highly recommended this book and hope Mr. Baldacci churns out more of Mr. Oliver Stone.

0374280967|5.0|This probably is one of the most charming books I have read in a long time and by one of the UK's greatest comic geniuses.  I have long admired Alan Bennett for his theatrical pieces and in particular the monologues, but this is something delightful in a different sense.  Bennett is following much in the footsteps of Flaubert by showing us how reading can change the life of a heroine. In the case of Flaubert, Emma Bovery is destroyed by the false expectations raised by the novels she consumes. The Queen on the other hand, the \\"Uncommon Reader\\" of the title, really comes into her own as a person with thoughts and ideas and most dangerously opinions.  This upsets any number of interested parties including the Prime Minister and various members of the royal household.  This leads to a rather unsuccessful attempt to deprive her of her literary guide, a nice young man from the kitchen named Norman, whose tastes tend to run to gay writers, much to the dismay of her secretary, a New Zealander named Kevin, the Prime Minister, and even the French President.  Having a monarch whose idea of conversation is to inquire as to one's thoughts on Jean Genet is something unsettling to that narrow clique who make up \\"the great and the good.\\"<br /><br />What Bennett does in this wonderful little book is to show how reading can really change a life if approached in the right way and how it arouses suspicious in the mediocrities who surround the monarch. However it is with reading that the Uncommon Reader discovers writing, something that at the end of the book presents its own dilemmas.<br /><br />I picked this book up because it was this summer's selection in Fairfax County Virginia's summer reading selection. I found it to be one of the most pleasant surprises provided by a work of fiction in a long time. All I can say in conclusion: \\"Long Live the Queen and Long may she read!\\"

B000TIO4Z0|5.0|Of course this is a fabulous bargain, but there is also a lot to be said against it.<br /><br />Firstly, there's the issue of presentation. The 69 cds and 1 cd-rom do come in serviceable, light cardboard sleeves (and the cds do slip out, without needing to be prized out of the sleeve), but they are identified only by number and work-title. Unlike some other sets, this one does not give a track listing on each sleeve. And that's a pain: you have to turn to the minimalist booklet, which contains the track listings and--well, that's about it. One very good thing is that the cds are arranged chronologically, so that you get to follow Callas's career. The bad news is that this arrangement makes it hard to find any individual title and, frustratingly, the booklet does not contain an index of which work is on which cd. You want to find the second recording of Norma? You gotta hunt for it. At this price, you expect the documentation to be minimal, but just a little bit of effort could have made this so much more user-friendly.<br /><br />Second, there's the boxing. The cd sleeves are housed in a fairly flimsy cardboard \\"drawer,\\" which slides into an extremely flimsy oblong cover This cover will probably have started to disintegrate in the mail by the time you get it (mine did). Because the cd sleeves are a thin cardboard rather than paper, the whole box takes up almost 9 inches of shelf-space. (Compare this with the economical and manageable 2 inches or so that the 30cds of EMI's Elgar set, with plain paper sleeves, fit into--a less showy format,  but way more serviceable.)<br /><br />Third, there's the cd-rom documentation. In a word, minimalist. A few photos, and the libretti of the operas (in the format of the booklets); nothing for the recital discs.<br /><br />Fourth, there's the remastering. Most of the remasterings are dated 1997, and therefore appear to belong to the \\"black cover\\" EMI issues. Some date from the early 2000's and therefore seem to be from GROC reissues. A very few seem to have been remastered for this set. However, not all previously released GROC remasterings are here. (Why not?) Identified below are the cds in the set that were NOT remastered in 1997 (15 in all). Note that it is especially (and sensibly) the earlier recordings that tend to be most recently remastered.<br /><br />cd 1. Early recordings (1949)--Remastered 07 (time: 24:23)<br />2-4. La Gioconda (52)--R 07<br />5-6 Lucia (53)--R 04<br />10-11--Tosca (53)--R 02<br />12-13--Traviata (w/ Santini 53)--R 07<br />14-16--Norma (54)--R 03<br />38-39--Il barbiere di Siviglia (57)--R 07<br /><br />Every time I get to compare the efforts of small companies such as Pearl with the major companies (including Naxos) I find I prefer the Pearl. And I know there are complaints on the `net about these EMI efforts. (Though I find EMI better than most of the majors at this.) So it's probably good that I don't have any comparisons for these remasterings. At times, I feel the sound has probably been smoothed out too much and deprived of life, but these are (to my ears) a vast improvement over some of the ratty old lp manifestations that are stored in my aural memories.<br /><br />Fifth, there's the number of cds. 70 sounds a lot, but be warned: some of them are very short measure. The very first cd is a massive 24 minutes. And the individual opera sets, of course, often contain one cd under 50 mins.<br /><br />Finally, there's the content. I have always admired Callas, but I've never been obsessed. So I wondered: do I really want 69 cds of that very distinctive voice? Especially since I already had a number of these performances in boxes with full documentation? After all (I told myself), it's not the most beautiful voice, and it did fray with the years. But, well, I figured this set would save space and fill in gaps and so forth, so I ordered it.<br /><br />Then I sat down to listen to all 69 of the discs, from beginning to end. I am wary of completism, but there is something to be said for this complete set: I found it is not just a convenient way to amass a lot of individual operas featuring Callas, but that it is, somehow, a whole that is greater than its parts--a massive work, an oeuvre, that provides a context and brings a talent to life. You know how it is when you decide to listen to the whole Ring over (let's say) four days. Even if you're ambivalent about Wagner (as I am), it's an extraordinary experience. The Callas experience is amazing. I found myself listening to familiar performances that I first heard decades ago, as though hearing them for the first time. I found myself thinking that I was really appreciating her for the first time--her control, her intelligence, and, yes, her beauty.<br /><br />For all the irritating inadequacies and arbitrary decisions in its presentation--and for all our frustration with EMI for finding a new way to repackage its back catalogue yet again every couple of years--this is a stunning set. So 5 stars for content, overriding (for me) the deficiencies of presentation.lot of individual operas featuring Callas, but that it is, somehow, a whole that is greater than its parts--a massive work, an oeuvre, that provides a context and brings a talent to life.

B000JLQSW4|5.0|It's been a long time since I heard this album (now a CD). It was great to hear it again. It sounds wonderful. Terrific mastering. What else would you expect of Alan Parsons. The extra bonus tracks are quite interesting as well.    Its on my iPod and is a regular go to for some laid back listening.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|Ocean's 13 is a lot better than 12. The only reason 12 isn't too good of a movie is because the plot's confusing. It's hard to follow. 12 is hard to follow because in 11, they showed you the plan, then they showed the execution of the plan. In 12, they show you the execution of the plan before they show the plan itself. Not only that, but the plan they show the execution of is a fake one. You have to watch it more than once to fully understand it. I've done this, and now I've realized it's actually a pretty good movie.     Anyway, 13 gets back on track by showing the plan as the movie's going along. This makes it much easier to follow. The first half of the movie is kind of slow and a little boring, but the 2nd half makes it all worth it. Basically, the plot of the movie is that Reuben is partnered with Willie Bank to open a new casino. Bank double-crosses him and takes it all for himself. Danny and crew get revenge on Bank by first reversing the theory that the house always wins. In order to do this, they rig a bunch of the major games in their favor. Then they steal Bank's 5 diamond awards for the final blow.  The way they show the \\"house losing\\" is awesome. It's kind of like one of those songs that builds up to a cool ending. I'm surprised that this movie is getting such mediocre reviews because it's pretty good. Also, Tess and Isabel are not in this one. Danny explains why in the beginning of the movie: \\"It's not their fight.\\" I would highly recommend this to anyone regardless of what the other reviews say.
B0010YSD7M|1.0|numerous others have already pointed out all the tired and cliche and done to death aspects of the so called \\"plot\\" of this movie, and after watching it and reading that I was not alone in my thoughts about my wasted time I have to ask: why bother? all they did was reheat an old enemy and then hit the \\"done\\" button at the end of the movie, if they were going this route why not just use the Time machine reset button? pull out the Time machine you know they still have locked away in the basement, fly back to the beginning of season 9 and take away the Ancient communication device, this way when SG1 finds the Ancient treasure trove, they don't accidentally contact the Ori and life goes on happy and prosperous. simplistic and boring to watch but then again thats what we got anyway and my idea would have only wasted at most 10 minutes of your life instead of well over an hour.
0439813786|5.0|I loved this book. The pictures were beautiful and the text was also good. I liked the way this book was mainly in picture format with some text here and there - to me it was a refreshing way to read a book.    There are also many different ways to interpret the pictures. If you take out all the text, the pictures could become a totally different story. I showed this book to one of my friends and he interpreted the story in a completely new and hilarious way.
1591396190|4.0|The theories and stories in this book should be read by anyone currently a part of running a business. Essentially, a blue ocean is a new market that reaches out to a population not contemplated by the current companies in an existing market. The authors warn companies to get out of the red oceans where daily and bloody battles for market share and new customers occur each day and encourages readers to create a new market, where untapped customers will be drawn in and competition becomes irrelevant because there are no more players in the game. This means changing the status quo, something that is hardly easy, but is critical in remaining competitive in today's global market. This book is a quick read and the ideas and strategies are worth understanding and applying.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I will not give plot details here.........if you enjoyed the first film, this sequel is even better.  Excellent.  Highly recommended.
B0018C7Q5Q|4.0|Although far from a perfect film, this was far superior to the boring Ang Lee snoozefest.  I'm so glad that the Hulk got a second chance at the big screen.  Edward Norton was a much better choice for Bruce Banner than I would have thought possible.  He has anguished and tortured down cold.<br /><br />The high point of the movie for me was all the wonderful cameos.  The tv clip from The Courtship of Eddie's Father and seeing Lou Ferrigno back on the screen made me tear up a little.  Even the theme music from the old Bill Bixby tv version was like an old friend.<br /><br />I can't wait for the video.  It will be a nice addition to my blu-ray collection.
B00007AJF9|4.0|if you like historical dramas (like I do), especially of the English variety, then this is required viewing.  I won't give plot details here, just go rent it, you'll love it.  The sequel, \\"Elizabeth:  The Golden Age\\" is even better.

0066620996|4.0|Good to Great is a great book for anyone in business. I was amazed at some of the less obvious lessons learned from the years of research as well as the simple truths that seemed obvious after they were revealed.  I am a small business owner with a professional degree but with no formal business education. It was good to read \\"research\\" that was not all stuffy and dry. A particularly strong point for me was the argument for why I should strive to be great and not just \\"good\\" or even \\"mediocre\\". I am planning on reading Jim Collins' other book, Built to Last.
B00006879E|5.0|This album is truly a great album. Released in 2005 internationally it is still rocking in 2008. All the songs are good most are great I recommend it highly I have already ordered their 2007 album can't wait to hear that I read the reviews some people say it's too commercial not as good as this one but look how much time they had to perfect this one.  They did a superb job.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I Love and truly miss the series, if you are a fan of the show then this is a must have series. It is nice to know I can pop in a DVD and have some SNTC anytime I want. My only regret is that I waited this long to purchase it. I shop amazon because the prices are always far lower then anywhere else, and the quality is great!!
B0016A2FFG|5.0|I bought this CD for my dad for Fathers Day. I knew he loved the \\"old School\\" music of Al Green. To my surpise, I eneded up liking it so much, I bought a copy for myself. This CD is a blend of old school and new school brought together in a way that only Al's spirit could facilitate.  Loved by the young,old,and the in between... bringing in new flavors like Corrine Bailey Rea and others. Enjoy this soulful multi-generational intermix.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I agree with the five-star review written by \\"Jem\\". My wife and I rarely agree completely on movies, but we were both captivated by this movie. The acting was excellent, especially by Portman. The sets, costumes, and cinematography were lush. No shortcuts were taken, and the production quality of this movie is superb. If there was a weak link in the acting, it was Bana. On the other hand, he was playing a banal and shallow person, so perhaps that is why he seemed to fade into the background when paired against the strong personalities of the female characters. This is one of the few movies that my wife and I wanted to see over again immediately after finishing our first viewing. Please read the excellent review by \\"Jem\\" to get a better understanding of the entertainment value this movie has in store for you. If you haven't rented it yet, you really should. By the way, I read the book several years before I saw the movie, and I thought the book was boring. The movie is so much more fun than the book, which is one reason I appreciate the movie so much.
0143038419|5.0|I can't believe the last three reviewers took away nothing of importance from such a wonderful book.  In fact, I'm not sure the three of them arent't the same person, considering how deeply they failed to see the value of Eat, Pray, Love.  Let me say first that I read this book before Oprah touted it, and I could care less that she did.  I don't follow her recommendations or watch her show.  I read what I like, and I LOVED this book.  I think if you pick up a book strictly based on some talk show host's recommendation, then you're probably a sheep, and not used to making reading choices based on actual research you've done yourself.  IMO, a book like this needs to be felt as much as read.  It is a journey for the senses, and not in the traditional travel-essay sort of way.  It's an emotional journey, one I was glad to take along with the author.  I feel sorry for those who spent time reading it and got no pleasure from it!  That's a bunch of time they'll never get back.

0316143472|4.0|In an interview with David Sedaris on the book's website the interviewer asks Mr. Sedaris, \\"How do you describe yourself as an author to someone who has never read your books before?\\" Mr. Sedaris answers quite simply, \\"Do you know what narcissist means?\\"<br /><br />I am one of these well-read individuals who have never read a David Sedaris book. I received When in Engulfed in Flames to review around my birthday and knew instinctively I was receiving a gift. I quickly learned two things about this gifted author's books. Number one: be careful about reading them in public because some of his essays will make you laugh out loud so hard you will embarrass yourself. Number two: you don't have to finish this book in one sitting. Savor the writing and read one every few days or simply at your own pace.<br /><br />I did have to enlist a few friends who are David Sedaris junkies and get a quick update on his family and friends. I knew Amy Sedaris was his sister but didn't know that Hugh was his partner. My friend gave me a quick rundown of his family, where David has been living and a quick analysis of his mother and father. That was all I needed to be instantly hooked and part of an elite group of David Sedaris followers.<br /><br />There were some essays I found tedious such as \\"That's Amore.\\" This essay tells the story of the love/hate relationship between David and his elderly neighbor Helen. At 27 pages long, I found myself saying out loud, \\"I've heard enough.\\" He is so quick witted you want to stop him before he gets unfunny.<br /><br />The essay in his book that literally brought me to tears was, \\"The Understudy.\\" Back in the day, parents would go out of town and leave their children with practically strangers. Nowadays we do FBI background checks before leaving a kid with a babysitter while we run to Target. Sedaris describes this experience of being left with a stranger while his parents were on vacation with such humor and absurdity you are left with the sensation of: did that really happen. Yes of course it did and that is why this book is so funny.<br /><br />Armchair Interviews says: Sly and quiet humor you expect from Sedaris.of course it did and that is why this book is so funny.

B000WZB944|1.0|I'd like to add my thoughts to those that think this product is poorly remastered.  I disagree that the original CD sounds better.  To me, the original CD sounds 'like blankets over the speakers' to quote another reviewer.  And the new one still does.  The only difference in the new version (to my ears) is an increase in the low end.  Unfortunately, I don't think this was necessary.    My preference would have been to pursure a more aggressive remaster like sound of the Joshua Tree tracks on the 18 Singles cd.  These same songs sound much better because the masterer had to make them even with later songs such as Vertigo and Beautiful Day. These versions offer much more clarity in the high end and overall eq balance.  This is what I was hoping for from this remaster version.    The album itself is 5 stars.  Updating the horrendous CD cover to be more like the vinyl is 5 stars.  The bonus tracks are 5 stars (as far as B-sides go).  But this remaster is not what I expected and hoped for.  I hope I don't have to wait another 20 years for this to be corrected.  And I hope the Boy/October/War reissues coming soon will follow the sound on U218.
0688014291|4.0|I just reread this great little primer on management and found it just as helpful as I did fifteen years ago. While its concepts are simple, they are also quite effective IF managers (including teachers, parents, and front-line supervisors) would implement them correctly. The three secrets of one-minute goal setting, one-minute praisings,and one-minute reprimands are based on sound behavioral principles and are bound to work as long as certain guidelines are met. For instance, goals should be realistic and specific, praisings should be sincere and immediate, and reprimands should end with a bit of encouragement. I love the idea of managers walking around trying to catch people doing things right. What a refreshing idea!<br /><br />Read the book and apply the principles in your home, office, or factory. While the three guidelines won't solve every human relations problem, they offer sound, practical advice that will lay the foundation for effectiveness.
0887307280|5.0|This book really makes you think. I am a small business owner, and when he explains about the technician turned business owner working himself to death, the manager dying a neat death and the entrpreneur dying an extravagant death, I almost couldn't keep reading. It hit too close to home. It is followed by great tips on how to balance the three and how to look at your business as a franchise prototype, even if you are not going to franchise. How to implement systems that requires the LOWEST possible skillset instead of the highest, and much more. Very much an imortant read for anyone new in business or someone planning to start one up.
0765350386|5.0|I cannot sing enough praises for this book.  Of course, it has its flaws, among them over-explanation.  The originality in its magic and setting more than outweigh any faults the book has.    If you like fantasy, read this book.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|If Pixar has taught me anything over the years it is to never doubt them. No matter what the story is about, Pixar always produces top-notch entertainment for all ages.  I expected nothing less from WALL-E and I'm thrilled to say I wasn't disappointed. In fact, Pixar may have just delivered their most beloved character to date.      Pixar's animation is always second to none and WALL-E is the most awe-inspiring effort yet. The animation is so good in fact, that many of the scenes make you forget you are watching an animated film. Every detail of every scene is fantastic eye candy that makes you want to pause each frame to get a better look.     The story itself is well crafted and easy enough to follow for both children and adults. There are a lot of really fun sci-fi elements that add a clever dose of creativity to the story. The first half hour of the film is almost completely dialogue free, yet the film never lags or loses steam from the opening frame. When we do enter scenes with more character interaction and action sequences it is well worth the wait.     WALL-E himself is a milestone achievement for Pixar. He is a robot of few words, but his heart and humility are what draws the audience to him. We effectively feel every emotion WALL-E feels and you can't help but love this delightful character. The romance between WALL-E and EVE is adorable and engaging bringing a human quality to both characters. The lengths both characters go to in order to be together are touching to say the least.      Throughout the film we do get somewhat heavy-handed messages about environmental protection issues and corporate conglomerates taking over the world. I personally could have done without some of these elements, but overall I feel like they were handled in just the right way to carry the story along.     In the end, WALL-E is a beautiful film about love and friendship and the priceless value of both. Once again Pixar has exceeded my expectations and I'm beginning to think they can do no wrong. WALL-E is a true gem the whole family will fall in love with.

0385736002|4.0|Let me first say that I am a reading teacher.  I often pick up books like this to see if my students might be interested in it.  I would expect my students (ages 10-14) would really enjoy this book.  It is extraordinarily fast-paced, is very explicit in the plot line and there are tons of little myths, legends and facts spend throughout the book.  The reason I don't give the book a 5-star rating is that I believe the author goes overboard with the pace and tells us things that would have been better shown or described.  Of the series picks up fans i could see it being made into a movie though.  It does have a really good plot and \\"universe\\" for the characters to run around in.
B000E1MTZE|4.0|The matrix trilogy is one of the finest and greatest sci-fi movie to come out of hollywood. The first installment was sufficient and the best among the three but I enjoyed the other two too. It is a science fiction on the surface but philosophy is bountiful and seems influenced by buddhism and hinduism (not the mythology though). The much stylized action sequence is jaw dropping. dolby true HD audio is mindblowing. It is a true cinematic experience.
B0010V4TZU|3.0|Vampire Weekend is made up of 4 Columbia University graduates that have self-produced this world music influenced debut album. Their sound is made up of clean, sparkly guitars, syncopated rhythms, canned harpsichord electronic keyboard sounds and strident vocals. The lyrics are somewhat naive and the sound is quite humorous, and instantly infectious. This band has seen a lot of success due to this album which is great since they have a lot of potential. However, I think that the band doesn't nearly live up to their potential. The songs are short, simple and predictable, all of them being structured very similarly. Many of the albums 11 cuts clock in under 3 minutes and the whole playing time of the album is just over half an hour (34 minutes to be exact). The songs that are longer than 4 minutes are really 3 minute songs with unnecessary repeats. While the band has a great sound, there is a lot of work that needs to be done with this group if they want to be really great. Step 1: Hone song-writing skills. The band will benefit from writing longer, better structured songs and expanding their musical vocabulary. Step 2: Get some experience. A few more years of life will get the band writing much better lyrics. Frankly, sometimes these guys seem like their still in college. Step 3: Write a lot more material. The next record need more volume. I get angry to have to pay 10 bucks for barely half an hour's worth of music. And Step 4: Work with a really good producer. This group needs someone who can really refine the infectious sound they've created. While this album surely won't make my top ten list for this year, but this band is headed in the right direction and if they develop like I think they will, maybe their next record will make my top ten list in a few years.

0743270754|5.0|Being occasionally an idiot, I find myself with some form of prejudice against female authors. But Doris Kerns Goodwin does a masterful work in portraying the events and characters of Abraham Lincoln's day.      This is a fascinating character study of the people surrounding the American Civil War (an oxymoron if there ever was one). It is made possible by the fact that with no telephones, radio, or TV media; people wrote. They wrote to spouses, family, friends, enemies, rivals, newspapers, dairies, in both personal and public formats. Goodwin's apparent exhaustive study of these writings is obvious from the beginning as she exposes both the true and the two faced characters revealed by their own writings.      This book was fascinating for me in several areas. Lincoln had two qualities that usually do exist in the same person. He was a warm hearted, transparently honest, relational, forthcoming person of character and integrity. And he was a masterful genius of a politician.     I would make this 'required reading' for anyone who wants to hang on to their sanity in a political environment. By political environment I mean places such as the management & supervisor professions, classroom teaching, religious ministry, and certain family situations resembling my own.     But beware, Goodwin's exhaustive character development of Lincoln's contemporaries can get tedious. I occasionally skimmed thru some of it, much to my regret later in the book. Pay attention to all she says, there is an incredible payoff mid way thru.     I saw Barak Obama on the news holding a copy Team Of Rivals and saying something to the effect that it was his favorite book. If you are a fan of Obama, you ought to read it. If you are not, even more must you read it to understand what he might be up too.     Thomas S Boswell

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I wholeheartedly enjoyed 300 because the movie works on so many levels. It has the action, stunning visuals, and most importantly a story that sticks with you long after the credits roll. Who wouldn't enjoy a movie about freedom, sacrifice, loss, honor, nation, and all the ideals that our western civilization is based on.       300 is quintessentially impassioned film making that actually has something to say about society and I highly recommend it. Watching it on Bluray only makes it even better!
0143038419|5.0|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Revised review - November 2014<br /><br />I'm leaving my initial review from 2008 up (below this one).  I have read this book probably 10 more times since then.  And I love it.  It took a while to grow on me, and I went through a bit more of life's bumpy ups and downs.  I can now relate much, MUCH better to Ms Gilbert's voice, her problems and her solutions.  It is incredibly brave to admit that something isn't working, particularly when it means you lose everything, house, possessions, money.  Even if it did come back to her quite quickly afterward.  It takes a leap of faith and confidence in one's self to make such a decision and follow it through.<br /><br />So, I stand corrected.  And excellent book, particularly for any woman who has felt the need for change in her life, even if that feeling only manifested itself in thought, rather than deed. :)<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Original review from June 2008<br /><br />I got this book used for 5 dollars from New Zealand's equivalent of Amazon...(Fishpond).  I was ordering other books, checked out their bargain area and there it was.  Having read A Thousand Days in Venice (Italy) and Holy Cow (India) among a zillion other travel books, which is a genre I obviously enjoy I was looking forward to this one.<br /><br />Good Lord!  Gilbert whinges and whines and is incredibly narcissistic and shallow - minded.  I feel for her husband and her boyfriend if this is how she acted...its hard reading it imagine listening to her go on and on and ON in real life.  Having been through a truly awful divorce myself I know how hard this is.  I also know that going on constantly to all and sundry is tiring and selfish.  It can also become a convenient place to place all of the blame for everything that goes wrong with your life.<br /><br />Nowhere does Gilbert appreciate the fact that she is being PAID to travel and write a book, four months overseas writing, OH the HARDSHIP!  Loneliness and depression, I need my Wellbutrin.  When you think what people go through every day and survive she comes across incredibly self-centred and immature.<br /><br />I realise I'm concentrating on her tone in the book but that is what dominates it, much more so than the travel.  Horrible, she should be ashamed of her behaviour quite frankly.  Yes she can write, but its overshadowed by her emotional/personal narrative in which it is set.rong with your life.

The video and audio production are outstanding.  The guys sound better than they ever have in my opinion and are entertaining to watch as well as listen to.  The other players in the performance are top-notch.  I'm a bigger Joe Walsh fan than ever before after watching this, too.  If you like the Eagles even a little, this is worth the price.
B0018QCXH8|1.0|To answer the question posed in the title of my review - BOTH!<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a powerful performance, but his character is not a person the viewer can identify with - which is fine, or would be if there were a sympathetic character in the film to offset his greedy, steely-eyed oil man.<br /><br />The movie confused me initially by leading me to believe that it was set in Texas - the landscape certainly bears no resemblance to the Southern California oil country - and its opening quarter hour with little or no dialogue was off-putting.<br /><br />Bleak, depressing, tedious - and deliberately obscure: not characteristics I look for in a film.
B001AGHC1I|4.0|You hear the exotic words uttered in a poignantly musical rhythm, feeling reborn. There was the symphony, the beat of life.
B0010358EE|5.0|This movie was amazing.  It's especially great when you see it in HD.  Although the format is pretty much done, there's no sense in getting rid of it being how you already spent the money on it.  This movie has an awesome story line and is really easy to follow.  The ending is fantastic too.  I highly recommend this one to anyone.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|I enjoyed this one very much. The plot has been already well explained by others so no need to go over it again here. (If I had to say anything about it, I'd say it's a story of obsessive love from beyond the grave). The ghost lady seemed to have been borrowed from Ju-On, (The Grudge) at times, though admittedly not as effective as that one, but the whole movie was very interesting and absorbing to follow and very well done indeed. I didn't get bored at all and loved every minute of it. No annoying laughs and attempts at humour, just a very dark story, and creepy atmosphere. There was a song featured in it, when the couple were driving along in their car, heard then only briefly, and then the whole song played out over the end credits, and featured on the dvd for the photo gallery section, and I wanted to listen to it over and over again. It did say in the credits what the song was called and who by, but as I didn't write it down and it was in a language I'm not familiar with, I can't say what it was called or who by, but it was credited with the date 1965 so maybe was a wellknown release round about that time in that part of the world. Whatever, it was a lovely song and I'd love to get a recording of it if it's available. It seemed really creepy in relation to the movie, and it was so nice to hear a theme song that shows the makers of the movie seem to have used some imagination in deciding what to use, whereas so often the music used in a movie is a bit of a disappointment. So full marks for that too. Very satisfying indeed.
B00008IHN1|3.0|Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a drum prodigy, a talent so profound he managed to receive a drum scholarship to Atlanta A&T, a school with a powerful band led by Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones), a band director who believes in the structure and beauty of old-school music.  In other words, Dr. Lee takes music seriously.  Too bad Devon doesn't.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Devon is anything but a team-player, butting heads with Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts), Section Leader of the Drumline.  Despite his unquestionable musical ability, it doesn't take long to learn that Devon is a rebellious malcontent, an arrogant show-off, and an individual amongst the team concept.  On top of that, he's a fraud and a liar - something clear because of the fact that a term of his scholarship offer was the ability to read music, something Devon can't do.  In general, his hindrance to the band exceeds his abilities, and he is rightfully put on suspension from the band's activities.  To be quite honest, I'm not sure why anyone would befriend Devon, let alone someone from the band he's so clearly trying to sabotage.<br /><br />Eventually Dr. Lee gets soft, and succumbs to the pressures of competition during the final showdown at the BET Championship against Morehouse Marching Band.  He lets Devon back on the band, thereby contradicting his own word and making a mockery of discipline.  The movie culminates in an amazing musical display that relies heavily on great epic music and beats, but also showmanship and a one-ups-manship similar to \\"You Got Served\\".  In the final battle, it's A&T versus Morehouse, a team known for slick, new sounds based upon today's top R&B and hip hop hits.<br /><br />I'm sure nobody would disagree with the notion that the true star of this movie is the music.  The underlying, predictable romance is pointless, and the entire performance by Cannon is forgettable.  This movie would have been better served if it were cut in half and just used as a showcase for the incredible bands.  From the tubas to the trumpets, and of course the dynamic drumline, the music is really the only real reason to watch this otherwise tiresome, banal waste of time.trumpets, and of course the dynamic drumline, the music is really the only real reason to watch this otherwise tiresome, banal waste of time.
1582701709|1.0|I went to a church with a friend of mine on Sunday and the pastor of the church preached about this book and how it refered to God. The Pastor said that he trust God and God alone. I agree  with him. There is only one God and he sees and knows all. Everyone who thinks that there a little God's running around here they are going to hell. How could someone write a book like this. It just makes me sick. Don't waste your money on this book......

0525950079|1.0|There was so much about this book that was implausible, one has to believe Follett was being paid by the word.  So much dialogue and so little said! I was very disappointed since I have been a fan of Follett for many years, beginning with Eye of the Needle.  Age has softened him I guess--even the rape scenes in WWE seemed like walks in the park and the victims got up and walked away with little or no physical damage!  Follett should have talked to a couple rape victims before he wrote these passages. Descriptions of the Black Death have been done much better in other books.  Could never recommend this as a good read--I was so bored I couldn't even finish it.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|Simply put, this is the culmination of everything that Priest has done over the last 30 years.  It blends harmonies and melodies from Turbo with hooks and thunder from Painkiller.  Unlike fans who simply want Priest to rehash their old work, this album is complex and thoughtful.  It's well worth your time and money.
0684865130|5.0|This is the original (at least in terms of modern relevance) satire of modern warfare and decision making. However, it achieves a level of humour very rarely achieved elsewhere. It is a very personal book, and some of the personal touch, sidesplitting jokes, and very dark serious undercurrent make this resonate more with me than some of the other great \\"political / moral\\" satires - Animal Farm and 1984 after all can leave you feeling somewhat cold.
B000002OZY|5.0|Few will deny that The Who's \\"Tommy\\" remains one of the all time great classic rock albums.  Although concept albums had been done before this one, \\"Tommy\\" was the first one to really catch a wave of public support and basically define just what a concept album was.  There was nothing like this out there when \\"Tommy\\" was released in 1969 as The Who raised the bar for rock n roll creating a work of art instead of just an album full of songs.  Of course this rock opera went on to inspire a film, all star staging's of the material, and a Broadway musical.  \\"Tommy\\" is not the best concept album ever created in fact it is not even the best by The Who (\\"Quadrophenia\\" is better), but it has stood the test of time as a great musical composition and remains a great influential album.  Songwriter and Who guitarist Pete Townshend began the run of his life as \\"Tommy\\" was the beginning of a 3 album creative spurt that is as good as any in the history of rock n roll.  \\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Quadrophenia\\" would follow \\"Tommy\\" and all three are bona fide classics without a weak track on them that would propel The Who to the top of the heap.
B00005JPNZ|3.0|Kingdom of the Crystal Skull might have been a favorite of mine if I had watched it a quarter of a century ago - before seeing the first Indiana Jones films and much of the rest of the Spielberg canon.<br /><br />Unfortunately for my enjoyment of THIS movie, I couldn't help but compare it to what came before.<br /><br />Without spoiling it for those of you who want to see the film, how can I convey to you, gentle reader, my disappointment?<br /><br />I see many \\"spoiler\\" reviews posted here, and I don't want this one to join the ranks.<br /><br />There is much to like about the film.  There is perhaps no living actor who so embodies the fictional character they portray as Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.  Indy is twenty years older, but undeniably Indy.  Seeing him gives you the same comfortable feeling as putting on a favorite pair of jeans or pouring a glass of your favorite beverage.<br /><br />But part of the appeal of the Indy of the previous films was his apparent real human fragility in the context of near super-heroics.  Near the end of \\"Raiders\\", after Indy has been beaten, dragged, shot and near exhaustion (in the time frame of the movie he's been awake for three days at least), he finally gets to lie down.  Karen Allen's Marion tries to jump his bones, but he is too tired and hurts too much to respond.  We similarly see Dr. Jones recoil realistically from beatings, draggings, etc administered in \\"Temple of Doom\\" and \\"Last Crusade\\". This AARP candidate no longer seems vulnerable to trauma because \\"Indy, Revision Four\\" takes several hits that would kill a strong person and barely flinches.  The \\"human\\" Indy is interesting - the \\"indestructable senior citizen\\" Indy is a cartoon character.<br /><br />The early plot is interesting in a movie serial kind of way - updating the convenient screen villains of circa 1940, the Nazis, with convenient screen villains circa 1957, the commie Russians.  Along the way we get to see Jim Broadbent as a surrogate for the late Denholm Elliott's Marcus Brody and Shia LaBeouf in a Brando \\"Wild One\\" homage.<br /><br />The last part of the plot is a mess, and though I'd like to say more about WHY, let's just say it felt like a blatant ripoff of at least two OTHER Spielberg movies from a five year period straddling 1980.  If you see \\"The Color Purple\\" or \\"Schindler's List\\" you have a certain expectation.  If you see an Indiana Jones movie you have a certain expectation, and the final part of the plot simply does not belong.  I felt disappointed in a \\"what a rip-off!\\" kind of way.<br /><br />Excellent stuntwork fills the frame in one thrilling set-piece after another.  If not for the \\"you've got to be kidding\\" ending and the newly indestructable nature of Dr. Henry Jones, Jr., I would have rated this movie MUCH higher.  As it is I can only recommend it for people who can't imagine missing an Indiana Jones movie - and you've probably already seen it.in a Brando \\"Wild One\\" homage.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Pulitzer Prize-winner David McCullough's excellent biography is turned into six hours of riveting television.  When I read McCullough's book three years ago I gained a new respect for the Founding Father who gets mentioned less often than the icons Washington and Franklin and Jefferson, but who had just as critical a role in American independence.  Before reading the book I didn't know that Adams was the lawyer who defended the British soldiers charged in the Boston massacre (winning their acquittal in a hostile Boston courtroom).  I also didn't know how outspoken he was at the Continental Congresses or that he pushed for Colonel Washington to be promoted to General of the Continental Army, and for Jefferson and Franklin to join him on the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence, which was polished by the eloquent Virginian Jefferson, but full of Adams' ideology. (The portion of the HBO Series detailing the Declaration of Independence seems more real and inspiring than any fictionalization of those events I had ever seen.)<br /><br />Adams was not as eloquent as Jefferson, or as natural a leader as Washington, or as globally respected as Franklin.  That he earned the second most votes in the first Presidential election (making him the first vice-president), and more votes than Jefferson in the third election(after Washington stepped down after two terms) speaks volumes for the esteem accorded him by his fellow Americans.<br /><br />He was arrogant and pompous (the series spends an appropriate amount of time on the ridicule he earned attempting to attach a vainglorious title to Washington's preferred \\"President\\".) But he was also completely devoted to justice, his country and his wife.  I read another review that said HBO had attempted to make this series \\"PC\\" by making Adams respectful of the views of his wife.  McCullough's book (and the preserved letters of John and Abigail to one another) make it clear that John Adams respected and loved none more than his wife, and I thought the series was realistic in the portrayal of their relationship.  Laura Linney does fine work as Mrs. Adams over several decades.<br /><br />This series does not take many missteps, and in many ways our Founding Fathers have seldom been portrayed as well.  Tom Wilkinson has the look and portrays the combination of old wisdom and geriatric lust of the 80 year old Franklin.  David Morse looks the part of the imposing General Washington.  Rufus Sewell nails the confrontational Alexander Hamilton.<br /><br />History buffs have little to complain about in this fine adaptation.thought the series was realistic in the portrayal of their relationship.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I was very pleased with my product. I had ordered this for my sister in-law as a gift.  It was well priced, much lower than the store costs.  It came in great condition and even had the original packaging as stated.  I appreciated that the sender also included the shipping number so I could track my item.  Overall, I was very pleased with the seller and the product.
B0002I831S|1.0|After careful of the contents list of each episode, I have noticed that one episode is missing - \\"Assignment Earth\\".  It was the story of an alien (played by Robert Lansing) who is intercepted by the Enterprise.  His assgnment:  To save earth from itself during a critical period in earth's time (the '60s no less).  The episode was to be a spin-off and, like all of Star Trek, far ahead of its time.  Appartently, too far for the corporate suits.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|Well, this is the first time that I read more than a few of the reviews. Maybe I misunderstood what a review is about. I've watched the show and enjoyed it very much, but that seems to be beside the point here. When I read a professional critic, there is never a complaint or compliment about the price. If you feel the price is too high, then don't buy the product. That should not take away from the acting, directing, writing, costumes, ect..., which I think were very good. The only complaint I have is the profanity, but that's everywhere. Yes, it is a bit like a soap opera with the telling of the stories every week, but they are compelling, informative, and even exciting. That's what kept us coming back week after week. The title of the series tells you what its about - Rome, but don't let that fool you. It's not just about Ceaser or Antony. It's about the women and men and children of that era and what their lives were like. It shows you how they lived and loved and lost. What a pity it only lasted two seasons.

B000V4UFZK|3.0|Poltergeist is my favorite movie of all time. I've been waiting for an Anniversary edition for years! This edition is very disappointing as far as extras go. I gave it 3 stars for the picture and sound quality which have never been better!    Where is the theatrical trailer? In the theatrical trailer for the movie, there is part of a deleted scene where everyone is looking at the tapes of the ghosts. They see a black shadow with red eyes and behind it the shadow of \\"the beast\\".  Diane covers Robbie's eyes and screams \\"That thing is in there with my baby!\\" Steve has to pull her away from the video monitors. I'm sure there are other deleted scenes as I know there is an outtake. The scene where Diane is forced up on the ceiling was originally shot differently. There was a spider-like stain above her bed that she ended up being dragged across and there was supposed to be more of an emphasis on a \\"ghost rape\\".  The spider-like stain was supposed to foreshadow what the children's closet ends up looking like. I've seen pictures of this scene with the spider-like stain and I have to say I like the cut in the movie much better. There are also plenty of documentaries that could've been included on this dvd. You can watch the Making Of Poltergeist on youtube. The MGM release at least had an 8 page booklet with production notes and photos! I hope Warner Bros will release a special edition of the movie in the future with a lot of the extras I've mentioned! There's been a long debate over the years of whether Steven Spielberg directed it instead of Tobe Hooper. I know Spielberg helped out as he did with other movies he produced.(The Goonies) Who cares who really directed it. Give the fans what they want!!!!

B000BGR0OM|2.0|Well, i was so thrilled to receive ULTIMATE COLLECTION a few weeks ago from U.S. (i am living here in Malaysia), to my surprise, the re-mastered sounded even WORST than the original albums. Re-mastered supposed to be better (check out the Re-mastered re-issued of PET SHOP BOYS complete titles, they really did a fantastic job there). I was so disappointed indeed. Most of the songs are edited, they should really  considered release another 2-DISC GREATEST HITS album. Great songs/hits like \\"BEETHOVEN\\" \\"DON'T ASK ME WHY\\" \\"REVIVAL\\" \\"SEX CRIME (1984)\\" are all missing here on ULTIMATE COLLECTION.<br />One star for the BEAUTIFUL cover, and other Star for I'VE GOT A LIFE.<br />That's all folks. It ain't do any good for me.<br />I already owned a EU Ultimate Collection, thought the re-mastered was bad enough, so I went ahead ordered another copy from U.S.hoping that it will sound better .... a geat disappointment.<br />Shame ... shame ... shame ....<br />P.s. Do not buy the Re-mastered album REVENGE and BE YOURSELF TONIGHT ... all sounded disappointing ... I rather listen to my old EURYTHMICS CD albums and singles ...

B000U1ZV3U|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the singular most underrated western epics ever made, if not one of the most underrated films period! WYATT EARP, with its epic scale, vast landscapes, gorgeous cinematography that captures a past era not with special effects, but natural period beauty, is truly an example of filmmaking at its finest, but at a scale no longer appreciated by today's ever-sinking standards.    And what a shame that is. Lawrence Kasdan and Kevin Costner are both obviously in love with the epic westerns of the 40's and 50's, the works of legends like John Ford and Anthony Mann, and it was that combined love they put together to create the life story of Wyatt Earp to the big screen in 1994.    It bombed theatrically, but garnered a devout cult following when it hit video and cable, and still remains one of today's most popular contemporary westerns.    Warner Brothers, if you're reading this, excellent work on the Blu-ray release and very much thankful that the featurette gem \\"Walk With A Legend\\" is included! BUT..........    When are we going to see the Expanded Edition you released on VHS years ago on Blu-ray??? I've held onto my VCR for the sole reason of having a source to watch the only version of WYATT EARP's Expanded Edition on the market - it's the only VHS tape set I still own!    For those of you not familiar with the Expanded Edition, it includes expanded scenes between Wyatt and Doc Holliday that strengthen the bond between the two legends, added footage of Wyatt's childhood, additional scenes better-explaining the reasons behind the fued between the Earp's and Clanton's, a crucial element unfortunately glossed over in the theatrical version, and several other key elements.     It's about 20 minutes longer than the theatrical version.    WARNER BROTHERS - please, please, please release the Expanded Edition on Blu-ray soon!! Maybe even include a new retrospective documentary or at least a commentary by Costner and Kasdan - I can't tell you how many times I've heard Costner asked about his love of westerns, and he always talks about this film.    WYATT EARP has fans, big time! This is what we're asking for!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|On first listen Viva La Vida has quite a different tone and sound from coldplay's previous releases. While it is different the same old recognizable coldplay is still there. Viva La Vida's sound is something of a surprise in the sense it was not what i was expecting but it blew me away nonetheless.     Although at times Martin's singing reminds me of Randy Newman(who i hate) this primarily happens in the song Cemeteries of London at the beginning but this small lapse in perfection that can be overlooked. I love that song by the way and every other song on the album for that matter. The album is rather short but then again most Coldplay albums are rather short aside from the 12 song x and y.    However, that being said Viva La Vida is a masterpiece.  Anyway if you are a Coldplay fan or fan of good rock in general pick this one up it is a great album. Every bit as good if not better than all of Coldplay's other releases.

0452289963|5.0|First, I am not an easy believer, in anything.  I work very hard and could be labeled an aggressive businessman.  After having my 2 children I started to see that what led me to the successful life I had was not what was really a successful life.  Money, cars, house, travel, all good, but not fullfillment.  I first read this book then the law of attractions.  I was locked in from the first few pages.  Yes, it makes you read slower to think and understand.  And you will only like, enjoy, learn, or get something from this book if you have even the slightest readiness in your being to be aware and present with yourself.  YES, it is a rehash of many, many, and perhaps all philosophies and religions.  Yes, this is a modern retelling and new light shining on those ideas for modern people.  If you did not like the book or get it, as Tolle states in the beginning, that is ok, you do not have to.  He also does not hide the fact that he is compiling all the worlds many philosophies into what was his own inner awakening.      Simply put, this book changed my life that by many views would not have needed to be changed.  My relationship with my wife, children, parents, and everyone...even the stranger in the store ringing up my purchases, all improved ten fold.  I do the same work, but with no stress and more success.  I live my life and embrace it.  So, read this book if you think you would like to learn something about yourself, how you think, and how you can become a better person.  A truly happy person.  If you dont, why would you want to harm the improvement of another because of your view?  It is only the view of you and even if others share it, it is still just that collective view.  Others can still enjoy it.  After learning from this book and the many others that can help with being more aware, you will smile to yourself when you see, for perhaps the first time, the negativity that holds others in their minds and life, captive.
157912688X|3.0|This is Agatha Christie's only courtroom drama, and the mystery that unfolds is bracketed by scenes in court.  She even presents evidence as if it were meant to appear in court, and Poirot is hired to help the defense prove that the one woman who could have committed the crime (or crimeS) in question didn't do it.<br /><br />The courtroom drama aspect of this novel isn't nearly as compelling as the mystery itself.  Overall, it's not one of Christie's best, but loyal readers will still be kept guessing right up until the end.  As for me, I am still guessing about what the heck the title could mean.  The book offers no hint whatsoever, so any clues to THAT lingering mystery would be most welcome.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|This album is easily my favorite of the three Shinedown releases.  I really liked Leave a Whisper, I accepted Us and Them for what it was, but THIS.....THIS is what I hoped for from Shinedown.  The musicianship, the lyrics, the passion with which they're sung....it's all here.  And, the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  If you even only partly liked Leave a Whisper, you will LOVE this album.  I've not taken it out of the player since I got it, and I get bored with music pretty easily.       I missed them when they were on tour last time....and I'm not going to make that same mistake again.
0345495004|4.0|Very interesting read pretty much from start to finish. The book doesn't concentrate primarily on Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture/design, but it does give an interesting perspective into his daily life and turmoils surrounding his work.    A little slow at parts, but nothing that terribly distracts from the book as a whole. Overall, a great read!
1400079179|5.0|This is the second Dan Brown novel I've heard, the other being \\"Digital Fortress\\". The story line is a history teaser. It makes you want to go look at DaVinci's paintings, read up on Sir Isaac Newton, and find out about the Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar. I was disappointed in one area...these so-called experts couldn't figure out the codes to open the cryptex. When they said it needed 5 letters to open it, I knew right away that it would be some name for Sophie. After all, her Grandfather made the thing. The same thing happened in Digital Fortress...the smart people took too long to figure out an obvious password and an obvious secret identity of a character.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book, but go in with an open mind. It is  work of fiction based loosely on historical fact.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Ere anyone bashes me for the title of my review, I'll state that overall, this is a great album - well worth the money. The warts on the album can in no way detract from the overall qualities - lyrically as well as musically.    However, as I listened, I couldn't help but think to myself that Shinedown is simply better at writing the slower-tempo songs. I found Devour, as previously noted by others, generic but tolerable. While I'm quite fond of Sound of Madness, I felt indifferent toward Cry for Help, and slightly hostile toward Sin With a Grin. Then there is Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide - musically facinerious and banal, the lyrics vapid at best.     Meanwhile, all of the \\"slower\\" songs are excellent. After a few cursory listens to the whole album, I found myself repeatedly listening to The Crow & The Butterfly and If Only You Knew (thereby avoiding Sin With a Grin). Breaking Inside, Second Chance, What a Shame, and Call Me are all very good as well.    As for the \\"Limited Edition\\" version of this album, I Own You is OK, but of the other two songs (The Energy and Son of Sam), the most polite thing I can say is that they make Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide seem like a pretty good song - in no way are they worth the premium paid.
1416562591|5.0|This is Balram Halwai's story written as an ongoing letter to the Premier of China to advise him about the real India; the one he probably won't see on his forthcoming visit.  In fact, it is Balram's own story of how he overcame poverty and became an `entrepreneur'.  If this sounds like a story of poor boy does well, forget it.  This is a story of dog eat dog, \\"straight and crooked, mocking and believing, sly and sincere\\".  It's very funny, yet as you laugh, you realise there is more truth than fiction although you're left wondering how much.             Called \\"Munna\\" (boy) by his parents, his father a rickshaw-puller and his mother ill and dying, he is given the name Balram on his first day of school. Learning how to fend for himself became Balram's best education; listening and eavesdropping on others taught him the rest.  Working in a tea room, and then managing to become a taxi-driver and from there chauffeur, he kept his ear to the ground, listened, learned, manipulated and schemed.  From small village to seething city of Delhi, Balram yearns to escape the yoke of `nobody'. From his nickname \\"White Tiger\\", he starts to realise just how long he and those like him have been captives of India's political system.  How will it ever be possible for him escape the cage of poverty?  All the other chauffeurs with whom he associates spend their time reading Murder Weekly; will the White Tiger have to resort to this level, or will blood be spilt and the cage doors open?  All is revealed as Balram continues writing to the Chinese Premier.  This is a book you won't forget in a hurry.
B000002P6R|4.0|I love this album.  That may have something to do with the fact that it was the first Who album I ever bought (I was 14). But I also think the songs are great.  They remind me a bit of the mid-sixties \\"Pop Who\\" as they bounce, snip and snipe.  Kenney Jones does a fine job, and it's unfortunate that he's gotten so much flack for accepting the bands offer to join.  Of course he's not Keith Moon!  No one is.    The only issue I have with this album is in the production.  If they'd taken off even just a bit of the gloss it would have made a vast improvement I think.  There's something a bit flat about the production.  Though Bill Symczek (or however you spell his name) shouldn't necessarily take the blame either.  The Who must have been familiar with his work - and for California rock such as The Eagles his production worked - but for The Who not so much.  The band chose him though, so it's on their shoulders.  Still though, I consider this a very underrated album.  Songs like Don't Let Go The Coat, Another Tricky Day, You Better You Bet, and Entwistle's The Quiet One.  There's a lot of humor to much of the material as well.  It's the Who getting back to the more Pop approach they'd had early in their career.  If the production hadn't taken the balls away from the sound then I think fans would have been more forgiving.  Anyway, great album cover too!  Enjoy!
B00005JLF5|5.0|I bought this for my fiance. He loves it. The purchase was super easy to make & we received it in a very timely manner. Pleasure doing business with you as always! Thanks!    Cherie M. Whalen
B0013FNC38|5.0|This is my third Jason Marz album and he just keeps getting better and growing more in his musical style.  Some of the outstanding numbers are \\"Details in the Fabric\\" and \\"Lucky\\" along with the radio playing \\"I'm Yours.\\"<br /><br />This album goes from slow melodic tunes, to almost boppy jazzy tunes of the 30's and back to our modern days.  I love his range of styles.<br /><br />Enjoy it yourself.
B00000K0DV|5.0|This duck don't give a f#$%!  We've got lots of blood, nudity, and a Donald Duck sounding slasher.  Just some nice trashy cinema for the fellas.  Nothing too deep, just high impact violence and sex like only Fulci can give you.<br /><br />Lots of rippin  quack quack<br />Lots of slashin  quack quack<br />Sleaze quack please quack don't hold back<br /><br />Brutality in all its shocking beauty

B000W7JWUA|5.0|We bought this game and instantly became fans.  The game takes a lot of strategy and has elements of luck.  You can change aspects of the game to make it different every time that you play.  It is a great game to involve the family and my children like it as much as any computer game.  There are little pieces and cards, so make sure to pick everything up when you finish.  It's not good for the car, though I think they make some kind of travel version, but it's fine for travelling as long as you don't leave pieces in your wake.  The game is an average length of time, aobut an hour or so.  We'd be interested in buying other games from this maker.
B001AXNGX4|5.0|They are the real deal. The guitar work in the second half of Under a Glass Moon is terrific. There is a lot of great material here, and I'm looking forward to listening to it many times before I truly form an opinion.  So far, it is certainly a 5 star album.
B00104QSOM|4.0|There Will be Blood is a movie that I wanted to see and it did not disappoint.  The movie based on the the book \\"Oil\\" by Upton Sinclair is a complex story, and kept my attention from start to finish.<br /><br />The music was great.  The mood created by the music made me feel like something was going to happen at any moment that would change the course of the whole movie.<br /><br />For me, what made the movie not just Good but Great had to be the actors and the characters they portrayed.<br />  Daniel Day Lewis was masterful and deserved the oscar.  His Character, Daniel, was my favorite.  I wanted to like him so bad.  The way he went about his life, the passion he had for his work, His unquenchable thirst for success were qualities they made me root for him.  But, and this was what made him such a rich character, his flaws were so overshadowing, I couldn't look past them and embrace him in the movie.<br />  My other favorite was the young H.W.  He played did such a masterful job in the role, that I liked him immediately and that never changed from beginning to end.<br /><br />This movie is heavy on drama and story, and light on humor, action, and anything else that hyptnotizes the masses today.  It truly is a GREAT movie, and it's one that should be seen and talked about for years to come.
B00154GEFU|3.0|For Asia fans, this is a must have, unless you are expecting any growth in the group over 25 years. This is another Asia album, and as such, brings back many fond memories of the first two Asia albums. It does not go very far in exploring new sound or building upon past successes. Still, worth having, and shows promise for the next album.
B000P2A256|2.0|I really enjoyed Maroon 5's debut and the diversity of the songs and, of course, Adam's voice is to die for.  When \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" came out, it was a very fun song and sound for them.  When I bought the release, though, I was disappointed that the diversity was thrown out the window for songs that all sounded the same to me.  Not to mention this CD is so overly produced it makes me want to barf.  Just not my cup of tea.  I find the songs to be weak, bland, over-produced, and unoriginal.  I didn't mind \\"Wake Up Call\\", but it got old to me fast.  \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" is alright, but again - very bland pop.  \\"Goodnight Goodnight\\" is alright, but the lyrics are so cheesy.  The only other song I don't mind listening to repeatedly, aside from \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is \\"If I Never See Your Face Again\\", but not the original version, I like the new Rihanna version.      Now I'll admit I don't care much for pop music, but this band really had something special with its debut, and now it's been thrown away for bland commercialism and cheesy lyrics.  Hugely disappointing CD.  And, no, I wasn't wanting \\"Something About Jane Part 2\\" either.  I just hope they bounce back with a better release next time.  The first few listens of the CD I kept thinking these were the lost tracks that were left off of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" release.  hehe... Blah!!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Donna Summer is back with a hot new album that is different than her disco days.  I loved her then and still love her new stuff.  Several of the songs you cannot help but stomp your feet to her music.  She does a great duet with Ziggy Marley that will stick in your head for hours after hearing it.  Her slow songs are just as amazing.  After turning 60 Donna still has a fantastic voice!!!
B0018CNNTY|5.0|Rather than give a step by step plot walk through, I would like to say this is the most visually stunning, memorable movie of many years.  Each scene looks like it was taken off the wall of a high end photo art gallery.  This movie was filmed in 18 countries, and we must be seeing the most beautiful, lush, intriguing sights of each country.  There is a feeling of quality craftsmanship, emotional involvement, psychic mystery through the whole movie.  You move with the power of physics, you sublimate from reality to fantasy and precipitate back to reality, ofen times quickly and at unexpectated times.  I was taked from the childs love of protected, guided heroic epic adventure to the pits of deepest depressing adult loss of body love and spirit and brought back to life again.  I saw this twice the short time it was in my area and despise the wait for the CD.
0156034026|1.0|The \\"Reluctant Fundamentalist\\" fails to deliver on its excellent title. It is brief--too brief, and I read it in a couple of sittings. The first half is good, and the second half God awful! It reads like a senior thesis where the author took a lot of care in the beginning, and then ran out of time and just dashed off the ending in order to graduate. The hatred by which the Muslim protagonist becomes consumed at the end remains glaringly unexplained,  especially because the author takes great pains in the first half to explain not just how he is treated fairly by the Americans, but how he is handed every advantage on a silver platter upon graduation from college. As far as I could tell the only motive for the protagonist's descent into a personal hell is homesickness for his country and culture. A very unsatisfying book.
1416955070|5.0|This book left me speechless and dumbified! I felt like an addict counting the hours until I could get my fix everyday!  The only downside is that now I have to wait until March 2009 for Book 3 *sniffles*  A bookseller at Border's recommended this book... and now I'm going to go to her every time I need a good suggestion!
B000002JSN|5.0|This album will indelibly be associated with one of my worst acid trips ever way back in the late 80s. There was this block party in college, and I ended up sitting in a room for four hours, listening to this repeatedly, along with Back In Black by AC/DC. Luckily, my friend had a great record collection.<br /><br />I remember Kashmir scared me, but, for some reason, In My Time of Dying, calmed me, and made me think that even if I met the Grim Reaper that day, it wouldn't be all that bad. Ten Years Gone is an epic among epics; of which this album basically consists.<br /><br />So I want to thank Zeppelin for helping through a terrifying 12 or so hours. Right now I'm on a kick where I'm listening to the aforementioned Ten Years, along with Carouselambra from their final, In Through The Out Door, a truly underrated work. It's hard to believe in an age where a band makes one good MP3, just how many truly amazing songs and albums these fellas put out. It staggers the mind.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|great book nice short tales of her trips that made me want to travel great for vacation...bit of spirituality but noted in title not overkill more eye opening
B00000342V|5.0|\\"Superfly\\" is one of the best soundtracts done in the 70s, reflecting the work of a true genius, Curtis Mayfield. It's one of those rare cases in film where the sound track is so good, it becomes an essential character in the movie. I still resent the phrase \\"blaxploitation\\" to describe all of the films involving Blacks in the 1970s. Rather than \\"exploit,\\" a number of them stood out as representations of what was going on in Black communities at the time, even if sometimes highly stylized. Films like \\"Claudine\\" (which also produced a fine soundtrack) and \\"Superfly\\" stand up as glorious timepieces of the era. And a film like \\"Shaft\\", while mostly a fantasy, reflected a different reality of the times (\\"James Bond\\" films) through a different colored prism. These films allowed many gifted people of color --actors, directors, producers, editors, camera men and others -- to work and learn their craft at a time when other opportunities were not open to them. In any case, the three films I mentioned, and some others, produced some great music that still resonates today and showcased the talents of Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes, Gladys Knight and others to a wider audience. I didn't feel exploited by these works. I felt uplifted. And the soundtracks of these works have migrated from records to CDs to MP3s because they represent the quality product of standout artists that has become timeless. There is no need to play these works off against one another in pointless arguments of which is \\"best.\\" They all are.
B0015T7Q98|5.0|I first came across this when a radio station reviewed it.  Within 30 seconds I knew I would like the album.  I bought it the next day and was not dissapointed. I did not like the bands former music and was really surprised at the extreme difference from their former work to Pretty.odd Being a huge Beatles fan I am not bothered by the obvious attempt to create a similar feel, if anything I was pleased that the album seemed so 60's influenced. The best track for that very reason is \\"Behind the Sea\\".  The lyrics are very \\"odd\\" and the album in its entirety is very melodic and you can sing along to every song.  I just really appreciated Panic at the disco's successfull attempt at doing something different that no other mainstream band (that I'm aware of) is doing. Some may feel they tried to hard, but it is a new favorite and there is not one song I skip when I listen to it.  If you like music that isn't formulaic and that every 14 has memorized you will appreciate this album.  If Miley Cyrus and Fall Out Boy rock your World, trying waiting for their next album.
0061537934|5.0|This was a great, easy read book.  Anyone who loves animals, dogs in particular, will enjoy this narrative by the pet himself.  Be prepared to shed a few tears throughout.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I saw this on the big screen at a theater where I live, and nothing beat hearing it in Dolby Digital Sound somewhere like that (except for seeing the man live in concert, which I'll be doing later this month). It was your standard rocumentary in that it contained his philosophical moments, mixed in with a lot of amazing live footage from the Nokia Theater performance. What made it one of the most impressive concert videos I've seen as of late though is the format he used for the performance. It was all his various incarnations on one stage for one night: acoustic, the blues team he assembled for Trio, and his full band. It's as if he opened up for himself all night, and it really gave you a great perspective on his incredible range as a young musician and how much he's grown since Room for Squares. At times, the guitar solos seemed clearly to be meditative moments for him, and you could really see how much this dude loves The Music. It will be very interesting to see where his talent takes him in coming years, because he has come so far already.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|As original as Pixar's `Wall-E' is, two films came to my mind.  One is a quaint science fiction movie from the seventies, '[[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]]' starring Bruce Dern, about a lone scientist who keeps the last forest safe on a vessel in outer space.  Significantly, that film had the first robots in memory with two definable personalities, even a few years before 'Star Wars'.  The other film is '[[ASIN:B00005ASUM 2001 - A Space Odyssey]],' a science fiction classic that upped the quality of science fiction on the big screen and provided the big budgets we now take for granted.  In that film there was a space station run by a computer with a mind of its own creating a real human disaster and mutiny within the wastes of space.  Unabashedly, they even use some of that soundtrack here.      Entering 'Wall-E' I was impressed by the animation and the fluid action scenes.  There are still plenty of new tricks to celebrate in this film, but the real chemistry comes from its two main characters.  This time we follow the titled character (Ben Burtt), a dirty, worn robot who works like a trash compactor at the city dump.  He gathers metal refuse and crushes it on his insides only to spit out building blocks for more city structures.  We learn quickly about his personality when he goes home to a storage room like structure where he likes to unwind his circuits and watch an old videotape of `[[ASIN:B00005JL1P Hello, Dolly! Widescreen Edition]]'.  A cockroach is his only companion, one of the few signs of life among the bleak city skyline.  Partly endearing, partly a nuisance, some heart comes to the movie as we see him follow Wall-E around like a pet dog.    Enter a space rocket.  It's a source of fear and fascination for Wall-E who's never seen such a thing.  Out of the alien craft comes a probe; one that mechanically searches the data of everything it meets and destroys anything threatening on its sensors.  As the tape gives him new meaning, he overcomes his fear and tries to meet this new robot, whom he learns to call \\"Eva\\" or \\"Eve\\".  Wall-E tries to impress her using anything from bubble wrap to egg beaters; his clumsiness showing his softer side. Love blossoms, but is not received until one day the rocket returns and picks Eve up.  Determined not to let a good thing go, Wall-E attaches his mechanical arms to the ship for dear life as he discovers a \\"brave new world\\" of comfy humans on a displaced technological \\"cruise ship\\" sent out for a five year journey.  Chaos ensues when Eve returns with a plant found in her inner workings after Wall-E gave it to her as a gift.  It doesn't fit the cruise control they're accustomed to.      Without being heavy handed or cynical, `Wall-E' charms us with its contrast.  We get all the themes implied here, but we receive it in such a glowing way, it never leaves the residue of desolation the movie so warmly, yet desperately, persuades us to leave behind.  Although the movie is received differently by children and adults, there's plenty for everyone to appreciate in this wholehearted movie offering.    (Anyone familiar with 1981's 'Heartbeeps,' starring Bernadette Peters and Andy Kaufman, knows that this movie idea has been done before.  Without the careful care of Pixar's craftmanship and imagination, 'Heartbeeps' demonstates that, in the wrong hands, these movie ideas can sometimes bring disastrous results.)      (More traditional is \\"Presto,\\" which continues Disney's admirable throwback to fine pre-feature animated entertainment.)
B00009Z576|5.0|I can't describe how rocking... how great the musicianmanship is... how infinitely PROGRESSIVE (for pete's sake) this album is!!    Every Yes fan should own this. The playing is amazing, the songs have strong melodies.    I'm at a loss for words. Amazing.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I don't subscribe to HBO and find almost everything they air offensive verbally and/or sexually.  I heard that \\"John Adams\\" was different and ordered it through Amazon.  Wow!  What an amazing miniseries.  Faithful to history both visually and verbally, Adams is portrayed as the significant American founding father that he was.  John and his wife Abigail remind us of what marriage should be and can be in an imperfect, fallen world.  They inspire us to live for greater things than ourselves, in service to God and country.
B00127RAJY|3.0|The workout is intense and packs a punch in 20 minutes.  Challenging moves and a reasonable pacing of moves.  I could see the lack of variety becoming a problem over the long term.    That said, my big problem with this video was the lack of sufficient cool down and stretching.  After 2 minutes of warm-up (not intense) and 18 minutes of intense work, the 2 minute cool-down and stretch at the end is a joke.  The result is muscles that are much sorer the next day than they need to be and a lack of flexibility.  In my opinion, better to choose a video which completes the process.
0756404746|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss's 'The Name of the Wind' is essentially a hero's tale, told from the first person perspective of the hero looking back on his life. The main character of Kvothe is extremely well written. At times I disliked him, but it was the kind of dislike bred from seeing yourself in another person's faults. The characterization across the rest of the cast is not as incredibly detailed, but it makes sense just because of the perspective from which the story is written (and does have some exceptions, as in the case of the hero's love interest).<br /><br />Much of the novel takes place after Kvothe has entered the University - think Hogwart's, except much darker. The magic system as described in the book is very well thought out, with explanations given for how magic actually works. It's a pretty detailed system, and its uses lead to some of the most action packed sequences in the story, though there is also quite a bit of humor involved.<br /><br />Kvothe's road to the university is not a happy one, and there are many truly heartbreaking sections of the story. It has been a very, very long time since I've been emotionally moved by a book, but this one seemed to do it every hundred pages or so.<br /><br />That brings me to the book's length, which clocks in at just under 800 pages. This is going to sound strange, but it's actually a very fast read, and never really feels that long. Rothfuss hasn't written any fluff into this story. You don't get explanations of the colors of the various locales and how they relate to the mood of the hero and all that crap. The book moves at a very brisk pace, and despite it's length, will leave you craving more.<br /><br />This is a serious fantasy book, and you should expect some fantasy conventions. Music, friendship, and magic all play a major role in the story (in that order). You won't find any Tolkien-type critters in the narrative, though (thank goodness!). That's right, this is fantasy without elves, dwarves, hobbits, magical rings of whozamawhatsit, etc.<br /><br />If I had to pick a criticism, it would be that I have to wait until 2009 for the sequel!ical rings of whozamawhatsit, etc.<br /><br />If I had to pick a criticism, it would be that I have to wait until 2009 for the sequel!
B0010X745K|4.0|Great movie about people. This movie got right what so many other movies based on books by Stephen King got wrong. It's about the people. His novels are so character driven that you care about the people so much that the plot fades into the background. The \\"creatures\\" in the mist were done as well as they could be. The ending was drastically different from the original novella by King. Likely done to generate more interest around the film. IMO King's ending would've worked much better, but it might not have sold as many copies. If you are a Stephen King fan this movie is must. Horror movie fan, also a must. If you are neither then avoid this movie all together.
B0017I1FO4|4.0|This album has really impressed me over the last couple of days. I have all of Shinedowns previous albums and I was really looking forward to hearing this CD. Leave a Whisper had blown me away when I first heard it. Brent's voice is a soul-ripping sonic assault. I liked some of the songs on Us and Them but for some reason that album didn't hit me the same way....now with The Sound of Madness...I am feeling the force of Shinedown all over again. The first difference I noticed is in Brent's voice. There is a new low growl heard in songs like \\"Devour\\" and \\"Cry for Help\\". Is there a note this guy can't hit? His range is insane. There are also some great slow songs on here. \\"The Crow and the Butterfly\\" and \\"Call me\\" are stunning. I cannot get enough of this CD. I definitely recommend it. I didn't like every single song on here so that is why I gave it 4 stars....but don't let that stop you from picking this up. It is well worth it.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|Great gangster movie. A nice departure from usual organized crime films about italian families or the modern day rap star gang bangers. Denzel Washington is a fabulous actor. He consumes the leading role of Frank Lucas, a man from Carolina that is tutored under a crime boss in Harlem for 15 years. After his mentor passes away, he fights to maintain the \\"kingdom\\" that was established. He revolutionizes the way that his \\"type\\" of business is conducted. Being a true story, I'm glad they didn't only glamourize the gangster lifestyle. They show the way that the drug trade affects the everyday people, including showing junkies passed out on filthy floors while Frank and his family eat Thanksgiving dinner. There's a certain morality to the story once you reach the end of the film. I've loved every movie I've seen where Washington plays the heel.
B000002O3I|5.0|It's hard to over rate the impact these early HW recordings have had on rock and roll. As is well known HW and his contemporaries were hugely influential on the 60s giants like Hendrix, Clapton, the Stones, Led Zeppelin and John Mayall but countless other lesser known lights have also sprung from HW's fertile loins. Even now, 50 or so years later, these two platters still stand up to scrutiny. HW's voice is one of the most distinctive in modern music and he uses it to great effect on every track here.  The lyrics are superb too, always lascivious, frequently laugh out loud funny. It's a stone classic in every way and anyone with even a remote interest in the evolution of rock music should own a copy. Also good for shaking your thang to... \\"We're gonna wang dang doodle ALL night long..!\\"
B000GGSMB2|5.0|Well, well, well what you thought that couldn´t get any better just did.  The greatest movie in the history of cinema has just been re-released with astonishing new features. Besides the great actings and excellent screenplay (developed by Oliver Stone) on this \\"Platinum Edition\\" you get the chance to watch \\"Scarface\\" in great sound and image. Serioulsy just to paint you a picture: if you have DTS at your home, you might wanna dogde the bullets of the shootings because they sound so real with the improved soundscore that looks like that Sosa´s guys are after you and not Tony! In a few words a compulsory item that everyone who likes good movies must have at the shelves of the living-room. As Fat Joe says on his \\"Lean Back\\" song: \\"Tony Montana Forever\\"! The Best! The number one!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I think this is one of the only albums I have liked almost every single track right out of box. This is a more mature, more refined coldplay. The style is very warm and mixing deeper. I like it a a lot, despite that there are no stand out singles. It is better listened to as a whole album, which is doable since it clocks in under 50 min. Get it.
0375842209|5.0|This is a wonderfully written book, told from a unique point-of-view.  I really enjoyed reading it, and could not put it down!
0743496736|5.0|This is the fourth book I have read by Jodi Picoult and I love how she details this story from so many different views. I always wondered what would make anyone want such revenge against other human beings. I still found it hard to sympathize with Peter but I was able to see how much he was tormented and how it put him over the edge. This book makes you open your eyes and think about your words. We never really know how our words affect other people. The relationship between Josie and Matt was particularly interesting. This is a difficult topic to read about but Picoult handled it so well and gave a glimpse into the mind of someone it can be difficult to relate to.
B0019HQIGS|4.0|I was fortunate enough to see Where the Light Is on the big screen. The only drawback was that I saw an edited version of the DVD. The DVD clocks in at 164 minutes and the version I saw was only 90 minutes.    This film shows us, what Mayer calls, his three incarnations; Introspective acoustic artist, rocking power trio guitarist and hit producing singer/songwriter. To me, they don't feel like three different people. The talent and heart of John Mayer weave through all of these, so-called, incarnations to hold them together.    Shot on film, the movie has the feel of some classic concert movies. A bunch of cameras with interesting angles and some smooth editing lend an intimacy to the viewing experience. You get to see perspectives not normally seen during a live show and seeing it on the big screen, close-up and personal added a level of excitement that you don't get while watching a DVD on your TV. But I'm sure the soul and power will still come through for the home viewer.    Acoustic artist John starts the show with some nice, jazz tinged numbers to get things warmed up and the large amount of close-ups and shots that wrap around him while he performs, invite you into a place you normally wouldn't be able to go. On Neon Mayer exhibits his nimble fingers and creative chord changes we don't normally see in a pop artist and a nicely arranged version of Tom Petty's Free Fallin' fits nicely into the set.    Johnny and the Trio play the second set and they really can rock. Like power trios of the past, such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream, these three highly talented musicians push each other to their limits and pull us along with them. At times it was like a roaring locomotive with all three frantically stoking the fire. On the exceptional slow blues number Out of My Mind there is a fire burning as Mayer wrings every note from the neck of his guitar until, it seems, there's nothing left.    The hit producing singer/songwriter closed the show and his band, astight as ever, doesn't disappoint. One of the highlights was a moving version of Gravity that featured one of Mayer's heartfelt guitar solos that never fail to impress. One nice thing, for me, was his staying away from some of the sappier pop songs that I normally skip over on my iPod.    There's some insightful commentary by Mayer that opens the film and is interspersed between numbers and these clips are short enough to keep the film moving along nicely.    If you're a John Mayer fan there is plenty here to satisfy you. If you're not familiar with Mr. Mayer's work this film is a great introduction to a young talent who, I feel, still has plenty of room to grow as an artist.
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|The music is like Kelly Clarkson and Avril Lavigne got together and had a satan child. The content is nothing but gender stereotypes and stupid clichés. If you have any taste, you will avoid this album at all costs.
B0012Q732O|1.0|All this movie needed was a  talking sloth and it could have been Ice Age3, but wait, that would´ve made it a good movie...so, i guess I´m wrong there.
B000YXMMAE|1.0|I paid absolutely nothing to download this album from the band's website, and I'm very glad I didn't give them any of my money.  This band's music is so frustratingly obtuse that it's no fun to listen to, especially with Yorke's exceptionally annoying voice.  I just don't understand what so many people like about this band.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I've loved Donna Summer since I was a teenager in the `70s.  I've watched her career jump and dip, but I only ever felt completely happy listening to her voice.  Crayons is a collection of different styles of music, but there is dance music for the \\"Classic Donna\\" fans.  I've purchased the album and I was so impressed with I'm a Fire and Stamp Your Feet that I bought the CD maxi-singles - something I haven't done in a couple years.  Each track is unique and from the heart.  Thank you Donna, we've missed you.  If you pass on this release you'll kick yourself someday when it's out of print!  I'm doing that now regarding her 1982 collaboration with Quincy Jones.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|WALL*E is a simple yet charming & enjoyable story. Truly wonderful & skilled filmmaking from the mind of director & co-writer Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo also), as shown by how much emotion and heartfelt moments can be conveyed with such little dialogue. WALL*E reminded me a lot of E.T, with his curious look at the world & his heart of gold. Along with stunning visuals (especially the large vistas), WALL*E is another more than solid Pixar film. Without a doubt, I anticipate it will bag the 2009 Academy Award for Best Animated Film.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Five stars for the whole package, though all of the movies themselves might not rate top billing. The original Dirty Harry is the best film of the lot. The quality of the picture & sound are great, as are the special features & bonuses (Dirty Harry police badge & I.D., anyone?).
B0017WI5VQ|4.0|I was suprised,because \\"Chasing Pavement\\" does not give an accurate description of what you will here. There are great songs. The CD seems short, but they do give you a bonus CD.
B000G2YD3C|5.0|I first heard about PRR through the NEARfest website- they have a real knack for picking real gems!  The artists also put up full MP3s so you can get a true sample of what the band is all about.  (It can be tricky to evaluate an entire prog album from 30 second clips.)<br /><br />The 2007 NEARfest line-up included PRR, and the 2 free songs were 'Nimos & Tambos' and 'The Intention Craft.'  The latter song really jumped out at me, with Chloe Alper's vocals being the 'secret weapon' of the song.  Before long, I was listening to these 2 songs so much that it was time to buy the full CD.  What a reward!<br /><br />I finally ended up buying it in March of 2007, and I CANNOT stop listening to it!  (16 months!)  Every time I hear it, there is something new that reveals itself.  To be honest, it took a good 10 listens through for it to totally 'click' for me.  In my book, that is a good sign- it isn't just ear candy, and although I cannot see into the future, I am betting that I will be listening to this for many years to come.<br /><br />I should also point out that I generally lean towards virtuoso type material, the kind of music that you can listen to each musician individually as a part of the greater whole.  THE DARK THIRD is actually quite the opposite: the sum of their talents team up and overwhelm my senses... I just can't say enough GREAT things about this CD.<br /><br />I just got a copy of 'LIVE AT NEARFEST 2007' in the mail yesterday- it put a huge smile on my face.  I'm obviously looking forward to their future output.  If it is even half as good as THE DARK THIRD, it'll be money well spent.

0316010669|3.0|Started out really liking it, but it suddenly started feeling suspiciously like a self-help book. I'm not crazy into that.
B0016B6ZKG|3.0|Well, friends, it's not her best, but it's certainly not her worst, by any means.    Yes, there's the techno-electronic-clubbin' aspect to the CD -- no doubt the target audience for it -- but there are some good radio-friendly numbers here that are very reminiscent of Donna's work of the past.  \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" has a great message in the lyrics -- gotta keep goin' -- and it's got a great beat!  \\"I'm a Fire\\" makes me think of \\"I Feel Love,\\" another one of Donna's masterpieces.    The \\"Hattie Mae Blanche Dubois\\" thing -- or whatever the hell it is -- is ludicrous.  I would have saved that for a show, not a record.  Hattie is a more visual, rather than auditory, type of concept.    So I rate this CD to be an 'average' Donna Summer record -- better than \\"All Systems Go,\\" but not as good as \\"Cats Without Claws.\\"  You really need to give a listen to Donna's 1991 effort, \\"Mistaken Identity\\" -- a four-star-plus effort that is highly underrated and disregarded.  I've played that CD over and over.  Get it, and you will not be disappointed.  It's Donna with a twist.    We have to realize:  Donna, as an artist, has evolved over the years.  She is not an artist who chooses to stays in one rut, though it seems as if most fans want her to live out her career in disco.  I respect Donna in that she's allowed herself to grow and to mature as an artist.  She has a conscience, and her deep-rooted, spiritual feelings are reflected in many of her songs.    On a more frivolous note:  The CD artwork is downright fun.  Kudos to the designer.  The concept of \\"Crayons\\" seems to imply that Donna uses all of the colors of the palette in her music -- not just one or two colors all the time.    From one of Donna's \\"Friends Unknown\\" --
B000OQF6N6|5.0|I assume some of the low reviewers have some sort of agenda against Smashiong Pumpkins, or have their parties in a wad because it's Billy Corgan and a new band.  Who cares???  This CD really really rocks!  The choice tracks are when they go the hardest (the majority) - great drumming and guitar work.  A few more mellow type songs, but none of the super slow stuff that the Pumpkins used to do (that I never liked much anyways).  I also dig the retro feel to some of them.  Keep up the good work.<br /><br />Side note - how funny is it that this came out the same time as Linkin Park, and this one blows LP away!!!  LP put out an emo CD and the Punpkins go hard!!!

0321356683|5.0|Effective Java, Second Edition by Joshua Bloch is certainly the best Java book I have read in a long time. As a disclaimer, I never read the first edition and I am thus unable to compare the two editions. Effective Java, Second Edition is a mostly easy and fun read providing you with many insights and best practices on how to use Java effectively. It certainly is not a book for the beginner just starting out learning Java. For that purpose you may want to take a look at Thinking in Java by Bruce Eckel instead. Nevertheless, Effective Java would serve as an excellent follow-up.    In Effective Java, Joshua Bloch does a great job describing best practices that you as developer will find useful on a daily basis. For example, I really found his description of the builder pattern (Item 2, page 11) quite interesting. Another Item that fascinated me, was Item 15 (page 73) - \\"Minimize mutability\\". Both items are part of a broader theme throughout the book that promotes creating code that is as immutable as possible. In that regard, reading the book will enable you to simply write better and safer code. The book also leads the way towards promoting functional programming techniques which will come in quite handily when developing multithreaded applications. Therefore, as a next book I may recommend reading Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz.    Even for the experienced Java developer, Effective Java contains quite a few little eye openers. I for example was previously unaware of how static factory methods can simplify the creation of parameterized type instances using \\"type inference\\". This is described on page 9 (Item 1). In the past I had always used something like this:    List<User> users = new ArrayList<User>();    But by using a static factory method you can do:    List<User> users = Helper.newArrayList();    I thought that this was a pretty nifty example that may help making code a bit cleaner. What I also very much liked about Effective Java was that Joshuapoints out certain short-comings of the Java language itself and its APIs whenever applicable. For example, page 64 describes the inconsistent behavior between BigDecimal's 'equals' method and its 'compareTo' method, and in item 41 (page 194) Joshua details the shortcomings of the List interface when using Autoboxing.    While the vast majority of the book was very easy to read and to understand, I found that the chapter about bounded wildcards using generics (item 28) was a little difficult to grasp and I wished it were a bit more extensive. On the other side, the provided mnemonic is quite helpful: PECS - Producer-extends, Consumer-super.    Overall, I highly recommend Effective Java, Second Edition which will continue to serve me, and likely you too, as an excellent reference resource.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|What a great find.  I've been playing this by the pool this summer and everybody loves it.  The CD starts off with some great numbers but it really picks up as the CD plays on, like a good CD should.  The last 3 or 4 songs are the albums strongest songs.  Great voice, great songs and more than one person has asked if we are listening to Dusty Springfield, NOW THAT IS A COMPLIMENT.  And on top of it all, we all say after listening for a while- Amy Winehouse WHO?

B0016A2FFG|5.0|WOW!  Isn't it great that Al Green is still making great music for all to hear.  We need him more now than ever.  The CD is brilliant and very moving with some great guest artist.  Corinne Bailey Rae and John Legend's songs with Al are beautiful.  Short and sweet, this is an amazing collection of song sung by the MASTER.  How could anybody be disappointed?
0312360266|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a fast read and is interlaced with some great vocabulary words. I highly recommend it, especially to female teens. Don't start it at night, though, for you won't put the book down until you are done reading.

0786948523|1.0|I've been an absolutely RABID fan of Dungeons and Dragons in all of its incarnations since about 1980.  I had all of the 1st edition and 2nd edition books, 3.0 represented a big change for me, but I grew to like it - and then 3.5 really fixed some of the bugs in 3.0 making it one of the most modular systems I'd ever seen.    When the 4th edition of D&D was announced, it seemed premature.  When the video of the presentations about 4th edition hit YouTube, I was intrigued - a lot of what I seeing sounded very promising.  I began to let myself get excited about the new edition, then I read one of the preview books - and began to get nervous, but I figured, hey, this is just a preview - they'll work out the bugs.  After all, version 3.0/3.5 had a few clunky spots, but if you worked through those, BAM, you had an amazingly well oiled machine, right?  Then I get the 4th edition rulebooks.  Wow, talking about a head shot.  We have \\"new Coke\\" in game form.    The Monster Manual is absolutely a train wreck.  Monsters read like they're simply enemies to be killed - like in a computer game.  I felt like I was reading the WOW or Diablo II strategy guide, not the Monster Manual.  There is no sense of a larger fantasy world - as that appears to have been \\"streamlined\\" away from the process.  Steve Jackson has to be doing a double take because D&D is now more Munchkin than Munchkin.  Same thing for the Dungeon Crawl guys, WotC seems to have taken the success of the Dungeon Crawl Classics modules a bit too literally.    I sincerely hope that 4th edition is improved as additional supplements are released, but I'm not holding my breath (and I AM holding my dollars until I see evidence of improvement).  At this point I see 4th Edition as an interesting game of below average depth and quality.  I fear Gary Gygax is rolling over in his grave to see the \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" name on it.
B000UPSKO8|5.0|It was a very enjoyable concert. Anna Netrebko showed her multi-talents with her beautiful voice, great showmanship, spontaneity, charisma, warm personality and had the audience in the palm of her hand. I particularly enjoyed her singing and dancing Franz Lehar's \\"Meine Lippen sie Kussen so Heiss\\" for the encore.

0393035158|4.0|I agree with most of Harris' thesis and was sympathetic to those views of which I am not in agreement up until Harris' argument regarding moral equivalency.  Of course a moral equivalency between the bombing of the pharmaceutical plant in Sudan during the Clinton administration and the events of 9/11 is an atrocious argument to make, but I think Harris betrays the intellectual justification for his entire thesis by glossing over and discounting the discussion here.<br /><br />As enlightened as contemporary Christian nations may be when compared to their predecessors in centuries past, it is impossible to ignore, as it appears Harris does, the clout the idea of heaven has for American Christians.  Harris implores his critics to simply take Muslims at their word and look at the motivations they espouse as justification for their actions, but then when it comes to Christianity and the West he ignores those same motivations.  The implicit understanding in Christian cultures is not far off from that of the Muslims.<br /><br />With the same degree of certainty as the Muslims, American Christians feel that they are justified in their transgressions against humanity so long as they can hide behind a thin veil of rationalization regarding their intentions.  \\"We weren't trying to kill thousands of people, so killing thousands of people is ok.\\"  You see this argument repeatedly advocated by our President, the one who thinks he talks to god, and other Christian politicians and pundits.  They tend to think that since our crimes are crimes of the heart rather than crimes of the mind, that we had good intentions but the result turned out bad, we should be absolved of moral responsibility.  Harris makes the same argument in this book.<br /><br />This arrogance and ethnocentrism leads us to pursue policies that we know will result in innocent death while providing our minds with a supposed moral disconnect from reality that allows us to believe that our crimes are not really crimes at all since we were well intentioned.  All of your objections to the contrary notwithstanding, it makes no difference to the mother of a child who was killed in an air raid whether or not you intended to drop the guided bomb unit on her child's school.  And then when, rather than accepting responsibility for it, you as a nation attempt to rationalize and justify this reprehensible act, you breed the hatred and contempt that is felt for the West, the United States in particular, in the Muslim world.<br /><br />Although a moral equivalency does not exist, we must realize that we cannot simultaneously preach the tenants of modern liberalism/libertarianism while arrogantly spreading that ideology through force and ignoring the negative consequences of that policy simply because we are not as morally reprehensible as the other guy.<br /><br />As much as I agree with most of Harris' arguments so far, his errors with respect to this topic have biased me against his subsequent contentions.<br /><br />Having read Dawkins, Dennett, Hitchens and Russell, Harris' conclusion regarding mysticism and spirituality devoid of dogmatic religious faith is what makes him stand out among the crowd.  What I find most frustrating about End of Faith, even more so than the problems I mention above, is that Harris concludes with that remarkable argument, but does not do it justice. Having established that dogmatic religious faith is a detriment to human happiness, his proposal of an understanding of our existence based on empirical evidence, rather than ignorant superstition, is the most valuable contribution of this book.  Compared to the extended lengths to which he goes to establish his argument against Islam, he merely glosses over the concept of Eastern mysticism and a legitimate connection to our existence that transcends petty terrestrial bickering.  He sells himself short on this front.  Hopefully once Mr. Harris completes his doctoral work on neuroscience he will release a follow-ontitle elaborating on this topic.title elaborating on this topic.

B0012Q732O|5.0|There's a Harry Chapin song about a teacher who observes a little boy in class painting flowers. He painted flowers of all colors only to be corrected by the teacher who taught him flowers are red and green and that's the only way they should be painted. The little boy moved to a new school where the students were painting flowers in a rainbow of colors but the little boy now only painted flowers green and red. I thought about this song while I read the negative reviews. 2 and a half stars? Seriously? What were you expecting? A National Geo documentary or something? History Channel maybe? The movie does not try to pass itself off as history, it's just a fantasy movie. A Romance / Quest / Adventure / Fantasy movie and that's all. Who cares if the actors had british accents or not? Maybe they could have spoken caveman and we could have read the whole movie in subtitles. Who cares if mammoths didn't live in Egypt, or at least some place that reminded one of Egypt? There are no such things as invisible goblins and stuff but I still liked the spiderwick chronicles. Was it boring? Well, it was not non stop action to be sure but it wasn't boring either. At least blood and gore wasn't relied on to carry the story line.If you like fantasy movies, and you don't mind suspending belief in reality for the duration of a movie, you will most probably like this movie. It had a good ending and I thought was well done. I am not a film critic, I'm just the common joe that likes to sit down and let myself be entertained by a good movie. It deserved better than 2 and a half stars.

0452289963|5.0|While I can respect a lot of the criticism, especially \\"Buddhism repackaged\\", I feel this book has reached many people in many walks of life. I do agree that the ideas are congruent with what I understand of Buddhism. I also agree that the teaching stories have been used before... as they have by many Buddhist (and other) teachers over the years, as they are so universal.     I do know that several people I know have been deeply moved by this book and have found great help from reading the philosophy and practicing the suggestions given here. I have several Tolle audiotapes and have benefited greatly from his books and tapes. I especially find his term \\"pain body\\" helpful in expressing how our life struggles and pains have come alive to form a complex with a life of its own.     While I am a single 60-year-old, I've fought a very heavy \\"pain body\\" as I grew up with Asperger's syndrome. The other people I know who have been helped by the teachings include many who are mothers.    I must congratulate Mr. Tolle for expressing this philosophy/spirituality in a way that has reached and helped such a wide range of people.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|This almost sounds too simple, but: Shinedown is a really good band. Seriously, from the lyrics, to the vocals, and, most of all, the sound, Shinedown is easily one of the best and most complete acts in hard rock today.    This CD has both the edgiest, and maybe the most mature rock from Shinedown so far. On most CDs, you find 2-3 \\"really good\\" songs and the rest you may not listen to again. On this album, I find SEVEN great songs (\\"If You Only Knew\\"; \\"Breaking Inside\\"; \\"Call Me\\"; \\"Devour\\"; \\"The Crow and the Butterfly\\"; \\"What a Shame\\"; \\"Second Chance\\"). Even the ones I didn't mention are definitely worth listening to again.    Lyrically, check out the words to \\"Cry for Help\\", \\"Second Chance\\", and \\"Breaking Inside\\". With so many bands cranking out good sound, but shaky or even offensive lyrics, Shinedown clearly took their time to make sure what they SAY means as much as how good they SOUND. I just hope that their peers check out the time and effort a band needs to put into making a great album.    And, it it just me, or can that Brent Smith sing?! There isn't a better vocalist in hard rock today. I think Shinedown is peaking, and still has plenty of potential to stay at this peak for years to come.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This one doesn't even need three times to listen to it.  All it took was one for me to realize how different and exhilirating this is.  I love the production and I love the musicianship and lyrics.  That last song is a masterpiece.  It does borrow from everyone but it's strangely only Coldplay. So much better then the previous album; up there with the first two.  The only reason why I am giving stars is because I want to write all this down.  This album is really above \\"critical\\" reviews.  Somewhere John Lennon is probably nodding with approval...
B00005JPTK|4.0|I must admit that I came into my viewing of \\"I Am Legend at a disadvantage. First, I haven't read the book upon which it was based (something I hope to correct soon). In addition, I'd heard much about the movie, both how brilliant Will Smith was in the role that had him alone on the screen for a significant portion of the movie, and also how the movie supposedly degrades in the last third. So when I finally got to see the movie last night, I was entirely unsure what to expect.<br /><br />Having now seen \\"I Am Legend,\\" I believe that the movie will go down as one of the classics in science fiction cinema. The cinematography is outstanding. When you see the epic shots of New York having been reclaimed by the wilderness, now the domain for the likes of lions and deer, the streets either clogged with deserted cars or choked by vegetation, you really believe that you are in the midst of the greatest tragedy of our modern times. The story is masterfully told in such a way that rather than being forced through a long expositional section providing the back story, or subjected to drawn out flashbacks that interrupt the forward momentum, the past is revealed in brief flashbacks, video clips that Smith's character, Robert Neville, constantly plays on his television, and other subtle but prevalent clues like photographs and newspaper clippings that are cleverly positioned within various scenes throughout early parts of the movie. This film, unlike many others these days, doesn't operate under the assumption that its audience is fairly clueless. It respects its audience, and I very much respect the film for that.<br /><br />Both Will Smith and his canine companion quickly become beloved friends whom you care for, which makes the twists and turns that occur later on all the more moving. When the enormity of the very fact that, in Neville's mind, he is the only living human left on the earth (besides the vampire-like creatures who used to be humans) hits you, you too begin to feel the weight of his loneliness and can then understand why he is in many ways slowly going insane. If not for the daily ritual that he's structured his life around, one gets the feeling that this man would have ended his own life long before. And there's something haunting about the base story here, that some tragic event could in fact leave a once life-filled metropolis like New York a cold, empty monument to a once mighty race of beings. Could our own quest for advancement one day be our undoing?<br /><br />While I must admit that the movie does seem to rush toward the ending, with the climatic moments seeming to come too soon after a major plot twist changes Neville's entire world view, I don't have a problem with the way the story ends. I suppose the ending is more \\"Hollywood\\" and less \\"deep\\" than I assume that the book is, but the ending in itself is very well done, and given the ordeal that this character has gone through, is one that works well for me. I just wish more time had been spent getting us to the ending because what this movie had, which far too few movies in this genre have today, is a solid plot that fed both the appetite of the action junkie and the person who prefers a great story. Another minor fault I must hold against the film is the vampire creatures, who would have been far more compelling if they were played by real people rather than CGI. The only CGI character that has yet to truly come alive within a real world setting is Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and that character was built upon the brilliant acting of Andy Serkis.<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\" isn't perfect, and the fact that it came so close is what's most frustrating to me as a fan of both Will Smith and this genre of film, but what it does provide, it does so very well. This is a fun, thought-provoking film that years from now will be one of Smith's most lauded performances. I highly recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks, author, reader, reviewerhis loneliness and can then understand why he is in many ways slowly going insane.

Another minor fault I must hold against the film is the vampire creatures, who would have been far more compelling if they were played by real people rather than CGI. The only CGI character that has yet to truly come alive within a real world setting is Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and that character was built upon the brilliant acting of Andy Serkis.    \\"I Am Legend\\" isn't perfect, and the fact that it came so close is what's most frustrating to me as a fan of both Will Smith and this genre of film, but what it does provide, it does so very well. This is a fun, thought-provoking film that years from now will be one of Smith's most lauded performances. I highly recommend it to everyone.    - Gregory Bernard Banks, author, reader, reviewer
B0015I2P0Y|3.0|My introduction to Elbow was Cast of Thousands, followed by Asleep at the back, and now the Seldom seen kid. Of the 3 I have to say I prefer Cast of Thousands.<br /><br />The seldom seen kid seems a little too much studio work, too polished and \\"busy\\" at times. The opening track has this strange calypso feel behind it, and just when you are relaxing this screeching note interrupts play and leaves you scrambling to turn the volume down. Not the first time they've done that, but this one really hit a nerve with me.<br /><br />There certainly are great tracks,Grounds for divorce is nicely up tempo, The bones of you has some clever lyrics; but I got the feeling they're borrowing musical styles from all over the place when they had a good one of their own. I'm sure plenty of people will disagree with me and find this a great album, and it is by no means bad, just not what I was anticipating.
0440234743|2.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting from this. Someone told me that anyone familiar with the law would see how poor Grisham's books were, legally speaking. I've only had a year of law school, but I didn't notice anything glaringly wrong with the legal material. All of the problems were with everything else.     The story starts out interestingly enough - an eccentric billionaire commits suicide and leaves nothing to his spoiled children. He leaves everything to an illegitimate daughter who is working as a missionary in South America, but who wants nothing to do with the 11 billion dollars. What ensues is a legal battle for the ages.    The best parts of the story are all about the legal maneuvering. There is a 20 page span concerning the depositions where Grisham hits his stride. Essentially, anything relating to law is where the book is strong. Anything relating to character depth and anything emotional is poorly done, even formulaic. He did not even need to bother with the ending since it had been telegraphed for so long.     Gone are the days where Grisham was the master of the legal thriller. This book is one of the many that have grown a part of his slow descent...

0316067598|5.0|I don't care what a persons political views are, this is a must read.  I also don't care if Marcus Luttrell is not Hemingway, that is not the point of this book.  Thank you to all the people who recognized this book for what it was instead of tearing it apart for something it wasn't even trying to be.  Thank you Mr. Luttell for writing your story.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|A mighty well done to cast and writers and the direction and production of this fine public service and rare superbly entertaining series.<br /><br />This is a wonderful compilation of one of the finest series on the American Political system that I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  The complete series viewed on a multi disk player makes the experience even more rich than it is without the interruptions of commercials or changing disk. [or turning them over over as with the original dual sided disks.]  The quick repartee, the dry wit and inside humor is delivered as sharp as it was written and equally improved by the ad libs that made there way into production.  I have bought and given away copies of this series to several and am continually please as how it repeatedly portrays that which we see in the current political arena.<br /><br />Following the birth and passing of an administration with all of it's internal crisis, personal sacrifices, daily humors and tragedies are a real insight into why men and women who enter the offices as middle aged  adults, leave gray and weathered.

B0014XCMVM|5.0|Alanis Morissette's new album \\"Flavor of Entanglement\\" has the deeply personal songs and undeniable vocal talent that we have come to expect from Alanis, but this is not the same 20 something Alanis full of rage.  This CD is very much about her personal break up with Ryan Reynolds.  But this CD is so much more that your average \\"love gone wrong\\" songs.  Alanis is older, more mature, and more introspective.  She sees how the battles of the world are really not that different than the battles we have in our personal life.  She is not only trying to find her place in relationships, she is trying to find her place in the world.  At first listen, her lyrics are so deeply personal, it gives you that moment of \\"oh I shouldn't be hearing this\\" but at the same time it resonates to the universal, familiar grief we all feel with the death of a relationship.  Gone is the in you face rage and it is replaced with longing and grief.       Not only are Alanis' lyrics reflecting her growith as a song writing, the music itself reflects Alanis growing as an artist.  She skillfully mixes folk, world beats with techno dance beats.  She so skillfully combines the two that you forget to be shocked that the two are combined.  There are few artists that can challenge you to consider your own relationships and make you want to dance at the same time.  In \\"Citizen of the Planet\\", Alanis sings of seeing herself as more than just an individual.  She sings of being unique but yet part of the bigger world.  This theme is repeated throughout the CD.  \\"Underneath\\" considers how our everyday conflicts are just microcosms of conflicts in the world today.  \\"Not As We\\" is a raw testimony to the grief of losing a relationship and part of your identiy as part of a couple.  Alanis sings, \\"Day one start over again. Step one step one. I'm barely making sense for now. I'm faking it `till I'm making it. From scratch begin again but this time I as I and not as we\\".  \\"Torch\\" is probably the most personal song about her break up.  It is a sensitive laundry list of all the things that she will miss about Ryan.  She holds nothing back as she sings, \\"I miss your neck and your gait and your sharing what you write\\".  Make no mistake, this albulm is not all morose.  \\"In Praise Of the Vunerable Man\\" is Alanis' ode to an emotionally available man.  \\"Moratorium\\" is her oath to focus on herself for awhile and take a break from her quest to find a soul mate.   All of the songs, regardless of topic reflect an artist that has experienced much growth and continues to growth through the good times and the bad.     Overall, this is a CD full of the new and of the familiar.  Alanis' unmistakable voice and painfully personal song lyrics are as familiar on this cd as on all of her albums.  This album reflects a personal and artistic growth.  She has more depth and more understanding of herself and the music reflects it.  The music itself has many more dimensions .  Like different parts of her personality, Alanis is able to skillfully mix and highlight sounds that seem like complete contradictions, but the end result is pure music to my ears.

1430300612|5.0|I have a friend who has had a stroke, and it has given me good ideas of how to help instead of hurt in my dealings with her.  It was also great information for me in how to spot a stroke.    The author unfailingly puts forth her experience so we may all learn with her expertise to make it even more impressive and insightful.  I loved the way she explains what I've been hearing about for years - left and right brain functioning.  I particularly loved hearing about the oneness and freedom when her right brain was primary.  Great book!
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is one of my alltime favorite blues albums.  It is an acoustic album and Muddy shines in this format.  The only thing I didn't care for on this version were the five bonus tracks.  They just don't fit the vibe of the original version.  On the other hand, it's some additional Muddy Waters for no extra cost!  Get this album and you won't be disappointed.
B00195BM3Y|5.0|Twenty-five years after its original release, The Chameleons' \\"Script of the Bridge\\" album is still a testament to the timeless nature of the music the lads from Madchester penned so long ago. Bands today are still name (and riff!) dropping The Chameleons. Honestly, if you played this to the uninitiated, chances are they'd think it was released recently.    To listen to this album is to take a trip down the rabbit hole. A strange and incredible journey that leads you to lands bleak and hopeless and heights dizzying and hopeful. In this package, you're offered balm for the Big Sad and hope that \\"this roaring silence won't devour us all\\".    An album most certainly for artists, by artists.    Welcome home.
0385340567|5.0|Lee Child's latest Jack Reacher novel is a sensational suspense thriller as were all the previous ones. When I picked up the first one and discovered that both Reacher and I were MP majors, with thirteen years service, I was hooked on the Reacher character.  It was more than synchronicity that drew me to the Reacher character.  It was Mr. Child's masterful storytelling.  I've read every Reacher novel, and look forward to the next.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Everything plugged in fine, but right off the bat, I couldn't get any sound to come out of my computer speakers. I kept fiddling Options>Preferences>Audio within Sound Forge Audio Studio (which comes with the turntable), changing settings, then putting them back, & somewhere along the line, there was sound & there was ripping off my old vinyl & there was the easiest sound-file editing I've seen. I've quite happy with everything now ... though Sound Forge Audio Studio doesn't always detect the gaps between tracks so it crams multiple songs into 1 file, where the easy editing really helps.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Hi, my name's Anne, I'm 17 years old. I bought this DVD because I'm overweight (my figure is on the curvier side -- a lot of my weight goes to my chest and hips). Also, I'm on my high school volleyball team and I wanted to get into some kind of shape before the season started.    Anyway, I've always wanted an inexpensive workout that would kick my butt, and this is seriously it. I'm three days in, and still really being worked out by level one (frankly, I'm scared to imagine the two higher levels!). Burning shoulders, aching legs, etc.     30 Day Shred is definitely good if you really want to feel like you've done something and don't have a lot of time (I work 40 hrs a week during the summer, and I'm in school the rest of the year). You feel it everywhere. Just don't give up! I may physically feel like crap when I'm finished, but it's a good kind of ache -- it reminds me what I've done and what I'm working for. I think anyone can do this DVD, if they're committed.    Some have written that Jillian's chitchat is annoying, but I don't think so. It makes the workout more personal. That, and she shows you modified versions of the drills, which is really good because I can't YET do regular push-ups for 30 straight seconds.    Anyway, I'm between 5'2\\" and 5'3\\", I weigh about 150 lbs, I'm hoping to lose 15-20 lbs. I'm doing this DVD and I'm also beginning to eat more organics and vegetables (I LOVE chickpeas). I'm going to follow the way another reviewer did -- I'll update via comments a few days.    If you are considering this DVD, especially if you are around my age, it has my stamp of approval! I hope my review and subsequent updates will be helpful to you!
B000YAA68W|3.0|Marjane Satrapi has indeed lived an interesting life.  Growing up in Iran and seeing a country and culture transform from the days of the Shah to all the turmoil that ensued in a revolution left her, her family, and her country devastingly reeling to find some semblance of a livable life.  Persepolis, graphically animates, Satrapi's comic book graphic novel of the same name and does it to great effect both with the story and with the art form.  Though I've rated it 3-stars, don't think it is a movie you should pass on.  Persepolis is what your friends will be talking about around the dinner table, at the local Starbucks, at Church, at your 4th of July bar-b-que.  Though the flick didn't live up to the high expectations I had for it, doesn't mean you shouldn't take the opportunity to immerse yourself in all things Persian to try to get a better understanding of a part of the world that has the single-most potential to be the next international conflict flash point.  Get to know Iran because it will be on center stage for years to come.<br /><br />The highlight of Persepolis is the animation. Though the physical depiction of the characters are somewhat one-dimensional, the animator Vincent Paronnaud uses light and color and unique shapes to enhance their emotions and the events of their lives.  There is one scene in which two older burkha wearing religious ladies acccost her on the streets for listening to punk music.  The shape of the ladies in their burkhas are almost amorphous, snake-like and the power of intimidation leaps out so much more than what it would have been if real actors played the characters.  Time and time again the animator uses the contrast of light and darkness to highlight a scene.  Many times there are the scene fade-outs where a white figure is left to the end burning itself in one's retina providing a subtle yet effective dramatic effect.<br /><br />I think of other adult animations and ones that really caught on and caught my attention did some different things either with the story or with the animation.  \\"Heavy Metal [[ASIN:B000002H4C Heavy Metal: Music From The Motion Picture]],\\" reached out to teens in the early 80's and then found a second life on the midnight movie circuit.  Though I was drawn in by the killer soundtrack featuring Sammy Hagar, Blue Oyster Cult, Devo and Sabbath; the movie tied in animation, music and story into a specifically teen targeted flick that stuck.  Or Richard Linkletter's \\"Waking Life [[ASIN:B00005YU1O Waking Life]],\\" that came out in 2003 has something so unique and creative about it that its take on philosophy stays with you years after you've watched it.  Though I enjoyed Persepolis and there has been much Oscar buzz surrounding it, I can't say it's a flick cut of the same ilk.<br /><br />Just for the fact alone that the Western world should be studying up on all things Persian, all things Iranian, is a compelling reason to run out to Amazon and grab the latest copy of \\"Persepolis.\\"  Satrapi's coming of age in a changing and seething culture is a story that stands out in these modern times.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|Aside from the language, glorification of graffiti, alcohol, cigarettes, and pot, Shelter is one of the best movies I've seen.  I watched it with my 17 year old daughter and a friend of hers. Trevor Wright did an amazing job. The music is also superb.
B0013J30W2|5.0|When I saw the previews for this I immediately thought of the Matrix.  The special effects looked like they would be just as good.      Now after seeing it, I was very impressed.  Indeed the special effects were every bit as good as the Matrix.  The story is pretty straightforward with one twist I didn't expect.  The acting was very good.  I did not know James McAvoy before this but he did a very good job.  Angelina Jolie was very good as usual, as was Morgan Freeman.      I would definitley recomment this movie to anyone who liked the Matrix and to people who didn't.  Some people told me they didn't like the Matrix because it was so hard to follow.  Wanted was much easier to follow but still had all the action, excitement, and special effects.  I was truly blown away by the movie.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I'm a classic rock and vintage metal (70's - early 80s) music freak, but I am always trying to find new music that I like.  I first heard Shinedown on my nephew's i-pod back when Leave a Whisper first came out, and of all the stuff on his i-pod, I thought they were most worth checking out.  I've been happy with the first two albums, but now with the new one, I'm REALLY impressed.  This is a really talented band.    I like a lot of the new rock sounds, but the vocals many times ruin it for me--not with Shinedown.  Brent's vocals are really impressive.  Lyrically, I like how the songs have some depth and a generally positive message.  On this CD especially, the songs all tie together well.    I think the harder songs on this album are very good, but the more radio friendly songs are also great.  This album is just very well done.  Good variety and flow of the sound and vocals from one song to the next.  Very cohesive.    In my mind, this is the album of the year.  This is a band with real talent, and I hope they get recognized for it.

I never knew this show was on until it was over, I found out about it after watching what has to be the best science fiction movie of all time \\"Serenity\\" which is taken from this show.  Get both.... Now...  My only regret is that Fox gets the procedes, I hope they choke on them.

0060007737|3.0|Good for branding basics, but once it dives into the \\"new world of the Internet\\" it stops being useful basically because every prediction they have about Internet companies and the mistakes they are making turn out to be wrong. The fact that you're looking at this review proves 1 prediction wrong, they predicted Amazon would die because it's straying from it's branding by expanding beyond books (its brand). They spend a lot of time talking how none of the old rules apply to the Internet, then they spend the rest of the book doing just that, applying the old rules to the Internet, and you can see just how wrong they were. That being said a lot of information can be learned about real world branding, and by seeing where they were wrong you can also deduce information about online branding.

0375842209|5.0|This was a wonderful book--not only for young adults, but for the general population. Characters were so well developed that you could really understand and connect to them. There was this repeating theme of \\"guilt\\" in many of the characters which reminded me of my upbringing in the 50s and early 60s--religion based and children of the \\"depression\\" generation. And, stealing--is it OK to steal if it ia for a good cause and you give back in return?   Death-as narrator--what an interesting perspective and one that gave us the sense that death has feelings too. Just thought this whole book was great. So many wonderful people who lived in \\"heaven\\".
B00132D808|5.0|I loved A Fever You Can't Sweat Out when I first heard and continued to listen to that album for a long time.  I must say that I was a little hesitant when I heard about Pretty, Odd being completely different.  I didn't rush out and get it the first day but now that I have it I absolutely love this album.  I've listened to it every day for the past month and can't really pick 1 favorite song because there are so many good ones.  If you are looking for something just like Fever then this isn't what you want but if you like Panic for the fact that they sound different then this lives up to that reputation.

B000Y7U98W|4.0|Sunshine on blu-ray blew my mind visually and as well with its fantastic audio.  I don't understand why some people say it was slow in the beginning -- this is not an action movie people, it is necessary to explain why and what is going on.  I am pretty critical and judging movies so this is why I gave it a 4 (would have been 4.5 if amazon let me).  Something I found interesting from this movie was that all of the actors were in big movies but not necessarily the top roles (excluding Cillian Murphy).  One from live free or die hard, troy, last samurai, fantastic four series, and so on...  All the actors did a great job and the cinematography was absolutely wonderful.  If you like movies you will like this one.  But just remember its not about 7 action heroes diving into the sun.

B00164KYS2|5.0|I have been a fan of Sex and the City for years now, so of course, like many fans, I eagerly awaited the movie, and stayed hopeful, even when it looked like there wouldn't be a movie after all. So naturally when the long-awaited movie was finally released, I rushed to the movie theatre to see it opening weekend, and I wasn't disappointed! The movie was fantastic, even better than I thought it was going to be. It was quite long (nearly two and a half hours) but when it ended, I wished it could have gone on longer!    The movie stays true to the show, and shows you what Carrie Bradshaw, Charlotte York, Samantha Jones, and Miranda Hobbs have been up to since the show ended. At times the movie will make you laugh, and at other times it will make you teary eyed. And best of all: you get to see what happens with Carrie and Mr. Big!    so obviously I recommend that you see the movie if your a fan of the show, and I encourage you to see the movie even if you have never seen the show, as they give you a summary of all the important aspects of the characters lives at the beginning of the movie.    I definitely wouldn't mind seeing the movie atleast once more before it leaves the theatres, and of course I can't wait to own it on DVD, so I can place it on the shelf alongside my other Sex and the City DVDs.    One more thing: I am now praying that they make a sequel!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|While the comparisons might seem unfair, it's easy to notice shades of U2 in the music and presentation that is Coldplay. With earnest vocals, soaring choruses, layered production and visually exciting shows, Coldplay has and probably are the biggest band at the moment. But as Bono himself once, \\"it's easy to be the biggest but we want to be the best\\". His trademark hyperbole and ego aside, Coldplay seems to want to take up the challenge and with a heavily anticipated album and huge iTunes sales, is Viva la Vida... a big record overshadowed by hype or is it actually good and deserving of its recognition? Well, it's kind of in the middle.    Life in Technicolor: Instead of the propulsive \\"Politik\\" or folk ditty \\"Don't Panic\\", this album opener quietly fades into a lush and gorgeous instrumental. A catchy guitar line, synth and some background vocals near the end, it sits the tone rather nicely. 9/10    Cemeteries of London: A very catchy chorus, handclaps and some rhythmic acoustic strumming; all in all it's a good song and one of the more memorable tracks on the album. Simple, but works well. 8.5/10    Lost!: More handclaps, organs and it's one of those more enjoyable sounding tracks on the record. While it's not a fun singalong, there is a certain degree of catchiness to it. I wouldn't really playlist it but I don't skip it when I have the CD on. 8/10    42: Sounds nice when it starts as you think it's another piano ballad but it sounds a bit more like \\"What If\\" from the last record where it all of a sudden picks up and it becomes a great sing along and the pace picks up. Again like the last song, it's not skippable though I probably wouldn't iPod the track. The hook stays in my head afterwards though. 8/10    Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love: The first track is one of the more upbeat tracks with what sounds like a mandolin, a steady drum beat and vocals that soar, this morphs into the 2nd track with gorgeous cascading piano arpeggios and Chris' quieter vocals. Both tracks are great and good companions. 9/10    Yes/Chinese Sleep Chant: The first half, which features Chris' lowest vocals in awhile is a decent enough song in and of itself but it's a strangely bland song. However, we're redeemed by probably my favorite track on the whole record. While the guitars sound odd, the combination of Chris' ethereal, almost entrancing vocals, the arena-rock shoegazing atmosphere and one of Jonny's best solos, I'd rate this song as a 9.5 but it's a shame I gotta suffer through Yes (7/10) to hear it.    Viva La Vida: Anthemic and worthy of a big arena showcase, combining simple chord progressions and the lyrics which speak of missionaries, kings and revolutionaries, it's a strange hit since it is a gorgeous track but on the other hand it doesn't have that mass singalong appeal of \\"Clocks\\" but people end up singing it anyway. Heh. 9/10    Violet Hill: When I first heard the track when it was released, I wasn't that big a fan of it. It's noticeably different than anything off their previous records and with some heavy guitar chords, dissonant notes and pianos, it's a curious choice since the \\"if you love me, won't you let me know\\" is a good hook but what's around it is rather uninteresting. Aww. 7.5/10    Strawberry Swing: Another strangely bland song but when you listen, there's nothing really wrong with it. Lead line's kind of catchy, and musically it's alright but there's no real hooks to latch onto and it becomes more an interesting song to listen to rather than something to blast. 7/10    Death and All His Friends/The Escapist: The first half starts out with simple piano and a nice guitar line before it picks up with a catchy guitar line, the band singing my favorite hook to sing (\\"trrrryyy\\") before it turns into another anthemic rocker like the outro to \\"Fix You\\" with the band singing in unison and another gorgeous Jonny solo. The other track is similar to \\"Life in Technicolor\\" but not as big. All and all, great closer. 9.5/10    When bands make a progression in their sound, some do it outright drastically that it's a bit jarring at first (U2's Achtung Baby, Smashing Pumpkins' Adore or Radiohead's Kid A) while other records do it a bit gradually. Viva La Vida is such a case where many will notice familiar grounds but their change so they're not just repeating themselves won't be as obvious. It's a huge selling record and undoubtedly one of 2008's biggest releases, but the best? Depending on how you see it.
1594489505|5.0|After the Kite Runner, I was optimistic yet reserved about this novel. I knew to expect a good story, yet I found it hard to believe a novel could shine brighter than the Kite Runner. A Thousand Splendid Suns did this.    The storyline follows two young girls of different generations as their lives mingle around one man during the chaotic Afghanistan of the 20th century. This novel cannot be missed at any cost. It surpasses even the Kite Runner.
0618918248|5.0|Though he has received highly virulent criticism for his books and opinions, (I think) Dawkins does a remarkably fair job of presenting his views on religion and god(s).  It is simply a result of the fact that the issue itself causes a great deal of argument and disagreement that it can be difficult to discuss.  Dawkins, however, does a wonderful job in being non-offensive in his remarks - if the evidence requires it, sometimes one cannot avoid being rather blunt in showing it.      If anyone actually takes the time to understand/read his work, one can clearly find a well-reasoned and thoroughly researched argument.  Indeed, in this book, Dawkins continues to present the case in such a way that I am constantly amazed that anyone can persist in disbelieving in evolution.    I find, more often than not, that Dawkins has the ability to present evidence, logic, and (quite simply) common sense in ways that make me say, \\"yes!  that is exactly how I feel!\\"
B0016B6ZKG|1.0|Lame songs, awful electronic distortion of her voice, the most disappointing album from someone who could and should have done alot better....and all of you uber fans of hers who would love it regardless of how it really sounds need to just shut up and let all of us have an opinon.  I love Donna Summer but I HATE this album!  She needs to do her own thing and not let producers make her try to sound like the non-singing skanks out there, she's too good to make an album like this!  BLECH!

0446401307|3.0|LAPD detective Harry Bosh has a new job in the Homicide Special division, which handles murders with political, celebrity or media connections, or those called hobby cases, which are difficult to solve and take much time. His first call out involves a doctor killed at an overlook above Mulholland Dam. Bosch and his new partner, Ignacio Ferras, are surprised when the FBI shows up at the crime scene. The dead doctor worked with radioactive materials and the FBI thinks his murder is tied to a terrorist plot to build and activate a dirty bomb in Los Angeles. When they learn that radioactive material has been stolen from the doctor, the case shifts to investigate the terrorists who took the substance instead of who killed the doctor. But Bosch thinks there's more to this murder than what's obvious.<br /><br />Harry Bosch is once more at odds with the FBI and his own police department, but this relentless detective will not back down and pursues his own investigation in his own way. Bosch is an edgy man with a rebellious streak, a detective whose skills continue to keep him in good standing with the upper echelons of the police department, although he always manages to alienate most of those around him. Although this mystery is relatively easy for the reader to solve, the plot is tight and suspenseful, and takes place within a 12-hour time span.
1401308201|5.0|Exquisite book! Quality thick pages and glossy finish. The cover is padded and antiqued. The Grimmerie details many aspects of production from casting to sound effects, with individual interviews with principles describing their character development and Wicked journeys. There is even a section on making Elphaba green!!    Although titled The Grimmerie they leave out Elphaba's spells and the script is incomplete which is disappointing. Aside from this, however, the book is fantastic and a MUST READ for any Wicked fanatic!
B00001U0DP|5.0|When this movie first came out, we went to the theatre to see it during a foreign film exhibition, and now, in an attempt to share it with the family and some friends, we acquired the DVD and saw it again, this time in the privacy of our home environment.    Life is beautiful is about love, romance, comedy, tragedy, horror, and it surfaces the best and worse of human emotions in a way that leaves us with the hope that someday we shall learn to live better lives.    Roberto Benigni starts as Guido, a young man who moves from the country to the city to work as a waiter for his uncle at a restaurant owned by the family. Guido is articulate, fun, possesses a great imagination and upon arrival falls in love with the woman of his dreams, who \\"falls from the sky into his arms.\\" Dora, played by Benigni's real life wife, actress Nicoletta Braschi, is dating and is soon to be married to a man that Guido runs into and with whom Guido has several controversial episodes which serve to add great adventure and fun to the story.    Thanks to several encounters where Guido and Dora end up in each other's arms, Guido conquers Dora's heart and they marry, forming a beautiful family. We meet their son, played by Giorgio Cantarini... and the child is simply magnificent as the stubborn, intelligent and precocious boy that struggles to live through the Holocaust.    At some point, this ideal family life is shattered by the Nazis who arrest and ship the men off to a concentration camp. Because she is Italian, Dora is not arrested but she goes to the train station and commands the Gestapo in charge to stop the train because there has been a mistake. He reviews the list and tells her that no mistake has been made, she is not Jewish and therefore, has not been selected to go, but she explains that her husband and son are on the train, therefore, she too... must go on their journey. The saga that ensues is simply heart wrenching because Guido attempts to do something that we know is impossible, make believe that the concentration camp experience is part of a game designed to determine a winner of a real tank. He does this to shield the child from the horror of what they have to endure each and every day.    What we enjoy most about owning DVD's is that we get to see the special features and bonus material provided with the films. In this DVD, the extras include interviews with many actors that had the honor of working with Benigni, who comment on his personality and charismatic human power. The interviews answer the question: would a Jew be offended by attempting to bring humor, fun, and hope into circumstances surrounding the Holocaust? They conclude that the film surfaces the horror of it all and yet, provides an endearing vision into the best of humanity; a father that risks it all to make sure his child is not traumatized by the insanity created by the most evil machine ever conceived.  Simply... a most see film... just make sure you have tissues close by.
0062513346|2.0|There are some great insights into the human condition, much like in The Alchemist, but this story is bizarre to the point where its bizarreness detracts from the message being conveyed.<br /><br />In The Alchemist the storyline served as a vehicle to convey deeper human truths, and these truths were the point of the book. In The Valkyries, the storyline itself seemed like the point. It seemed like Coelho wanted the world to know the weird magic/drugs/psychedelic jaunts he's been on; it's 187 pages ripped out of his personal journal with no real point. The deeper human truths felt like a literary afterthought.<br /><br />If you haven't read The Alchemist, read that first. This book would have spoiled me on the author. I'd give it a pass.

B0007OASII|5.0|Whenever I come across a band like Kamelot, I just want to give them all a big hug and yell \\"Thank you!\\" at the top of my lungs.  By this, I mean a band that takes a genre that consists of a LOT of mediocre to downright horrible artists, and makes it into something more enjoyable and more exquisitely crafted than you ever thought it could be.  With \\"The Black Halo\\", they have made what is far and away the best power metal I have ever heard.<br /><br />Where to even begin singing its praise?  Well, the songwriting is definitely important.  You could listen to literally dozens of power metal albums, and not not hear anything particularly memorable or distinctive about any of them.  This album, however, has stunningly crafted songs, filled with perfect musicianship, layers of instrumentation, and more diversity in any one song than most bands of this ilk have in their entire catalog.  The lyrics are actually cool too, retelling Goethe's classic \\"Faust\\" with striking diction and genuine emotion.<br /><br />And of course, the vocals here are fantastic as well.  This is evident from the beginning, with the opening track \\"March of Mephisto\\", which features the three-pronged attack of Roy Khan, the lovely Simone Simons, and the demonic growls of Shagrath from Dimmu Borgir (they even made a cool video, where you can see him in his hilarious hardcore black metal facepaint).  These three very contrasting vocal styles meld together surprisingly well.  A lot of albums have been referred to as \\"rock operas\\", but this is perhaps the only album I've heard that really felt like an actual opera to me, the way that each singer represents a character in the story, and the way the vocals are all so perfectly arranged around each other.  Again, this is truly killer songwriting.<br /><br />But obviously the real star, as always, is Roy Khan, who is hands-down the best singer in any sort of power metal band, and in my opinion one of the best singers, well...period.  His tone, range, and inhumanly beautiful intonations all make him stand out far above the herd.  Listen to \\"Moonlight\\", \\"Soul Society\\", \\"When the Lights Are Down\\", \\"The Haunting\\" (an amazing duet with Simone), the chilling ballad \\"Abandoned\\", and the hugely epic \\"Memento Mori\\", which are all carried perfectly by Khan's powerful vocals.  Oh, and another cool thing about Khan: I can't quite prove this just yet, but I am 67% sure that he is a vampire.  But that's beside the point...<br /><br />I believe I mentioned the musicianship earlier, but let's expand on that a bit.  Firstly, the guitar playing is among the best in the genre, ranging from thick and crunchy riffs, spine-tingling melodies, and brillianly crafted solos (no Yngwie wannabe crap with god-awful tone here ).  The drumming is powerful and diverse, never descending into mindless double bass onslaughts.  The keyboards are beautiful and multilayered synth melodies, and yes, Jens Johannsson (AKA the High Priest of Synth Cheese Suckitude) does contribute solos on a couple of songs, but they are surprisingly not awful (and even if you don't like them, it's only two little solos on two songs, so not a big deal).  There's also lots of great piano, most notably on the aforementioned ballad \\"Abandoned\\".  The song tempos range from fast speed metal to crunchy mid-pace stuff to grandiose melodies, and the album never gets repetitious or predictable in any way.  Again, this is just really freaking great songwriting.<br /><br />So, long story short, this is a really great album.  As Lord Chimp so eloquently put it, why do other power metal bands even exist?  I think this is pretty much better than every other power metal album I've ever heard put together (including other Kamelot albums).  Fan of the genre or not, this is something that really needs to be heard.tions all make him stand out far above the herd.

0060764899|5.0|This is one of the very few books I can truly say I will read over again.  It is very well written, never short of any details, and I couldn't wait to see what happened each time.  It kept my interest throughout the enitre book.<br /><br />It is quite easy to imagine Aslan, the four children, the beavers, the white witch, and all the characters.  And each character has a distinct personality.  You learn to adore Lucy and Susan, and you learn how brave Peter is, and you can't help but to dislike Edmund.  And I kind of wish Edmund wouldn't have gone to the witch, but every detail of the book is important.  There is a lesson to be learned about sacrifice, understanding, and love.  Aslan is the forefront of those lessons in this book.<br /><br />In my opinion, the book was written perfectly.  It got all kinds of feelings and emotions from me.  I do recommend this book for yourself and your young reader.<br /><br />And if you haven't seen the movie yet, definitely read the book first.<br /><br />Thanks.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|This version of Jane Austen's classic, is so far from a well produced drama that it doesn't merit being called drama.  Not because of the acting but because the script, directing and sequencing in an attempt to modernize and shorten results in a movie that is difficult to follow, whose characters seem shallow and within a short time, you think to yourself, why am I watching this bollix of a film in the first place.  Watch the Amanda Root version, much better, true to the story and a classic that warrants your time!
037571457X|5.0|Although this book is written like a comic book, don't take it lightly.  The story is a deep and meaningful one.  It is a pretty fast read but not as fast as you'd think...I highly recommend it!
0385340567|1.0|After reading the first one-hundred pages of Nothing to Lose, I was curious to see if others were as disappointed as I was. I discovered that virtually everyone commenting in this forum felt the same: a keen sense of disappointment combined with hope that the book is an aberration    A highlight of most Reacher novels has been his outside-the-box solutions to problems. They have invariably been both logical and entertaining. In Nothing to Lose, all that remains is the outside-the-box part. Reacher's reasoning when he calculated that the deputy outside the diner would not shoot him, when he concluded that no one was armed in the bar fight, when he told the female deputy not to call the State Police, and in too many other instances, was pathetic.     Sadly, except for the author's continuing overuse of the word \\"maybe,\\"and one of the funniest vignettes I have ever read beginning on page 334, the only thing the book will be remembered for is his use of the story to vent his anti-war views. Hear this Mr Child: even if we agree with you--and  many of us probably do, (although most real soldiers do not)--we don't read a Reacher novel to listen to your political opinions, or to even be reminded of the issues involved! On the contrary, we pay you to take us to a better world, where good--in the form of Jack Reacher--triumphs and does so in extraordinarily satisfying ways.    Like other ardent Reacher fans, I hope that Nothing to Lose will prove to be an anomaly. In any case, I look forward to the next one. Maybe.
B0017APPT8|5.0|Having watched this movie numerous times in the theater and on DVD, I am proud to own the BluRay copy now.  I must say they did a BRILLANT job on the transfer.  The color is vivid and the sound is truly top notch.  Some transfers of older movies aren't that good, but they took their time with this one.  The special effects are great but on some scenes you can tell that it is CGI.  Minus that the transfer is great.

B000Q6GUTI|3.0|I would have given this movie a 4 star rating if only Mark Walhberg could have smiled just once. The grumpy and pissed-off look was too much to take for the long duration of the film. Sure, Shooter is no teen flick or love story but even one wry smile, at some point in the film could have put the viewer at some ease. In fact Mark has been showing the same face for many movies now and it is high time we saw a change. Two hours was also too long for this movie which I thought wasn't a nice idea. The incredible hardware (rifles) were an admirable part and using them Mark is able to shoot a target from a mile away. The action is good and so is the plot and story that keeps one gripped to the movie till the end. Nice to see Danny Glover after a break though he had a negative role in this movie. Three stars for the action and story.

B000A7DVRC|5.0|This movie just gets better and better:  it is shame that the Academy overlooked Jeff Bridges and John Goodman's performances.  The \\"Dude\\" is a perfect imitation of himself, beginning with the opening scene where he writes a check for 79 cents. John Goodman's \\"Walter\\" is just too real: I KNOW guys like Walter, and Goodman does these gentlemen to a \\"tee\\"....when it comes to acting, they are both in their element in this movie.  A rich blend of good story lines, good comedy, and very earthy people bring together what should have been a smash hit and not a cult favorite.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Absolutely brilliant.  Their best album yet, and that includes the formerly-incomparable Rush Of Blood To The Head.  Every song on here is a delight, and also a slight departure from their previous albums.  Martin's normally high-pitched voice that sends dogs running from the room has toned down a bit, and the music is fantastic.  I especially liked the opening instrumental track Life In Technicolor, Cemetries Of London, Lovers In Japan and my very favorite, Chinese Sleep Chant, which is the second half of the sixth track entitled Yes.  My one very minor complaint is that both the fifth and sixth tracks should have been broken up into two separate songs each, but oh well.  As I said, this complaint is very minor, and the album is a classic in my opinion and in constant rotation in my cd player.  As for the Satriani complaint of copyright infringement...I like both artists immensely and hope for the whole thing to get resolved quickly.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|This is a great mellow, soulful album with wonderful melodies and great guests. A personal favorite is \\"Stay With Me (By The Sea)\\" featuring John Legend.
B0018CAANG|5.0|Hard Candy has finally arrived. I have been waiting impatiently for this release. I have to admit that this is one of Madonna's best albums. For those of you who are worried that this album is too Timbaland/Pharrell/Timberlake, FEAR NOT! . . . This album is very much Madonna. The songs are amazing and the overall feel of the album is amazing. 4 Minutes does not represent the album properly. There are many other tracks that are much better than the first single. Gems like Give It 2 Me & Incredible give a better insight into what Hard Candy sounds like. Don't be quick to judge and take a listen. You're in for a sweet surprise!!     Here's a track by track review:     Candy Shop: This is pretty much the same version as the one that leaked months ago. Im guessing Madonna   liked how it sounded so she didn't bother to change it. Still it is fun to listen to.   \\"My Sugar is RAW\\"     4 Minutes: You all know this one.     Give It 2 Me: Definitely one of the best tracks. It has a modern pop sound with some 80s influence. Very fun & energetic.   \\"Get Stupid, Don't Stop It\\"     Heartbeat: Love the electro-sound of this track. More of a mid-tempo song but still good enough to dance to.   \\"See My Booty Get Down\\"     Miles Away: Very Sweet. Obviously for her hubby Guy. This song features some acoustic guitars as well as some dance flavor towards the end.   \\"You always have the biggest heart when we're 6,000 miles apart\\"     She's Not Me: This song reminds me of Sorry. M letting the guy know that no one compares to her. Good sound and great lyrics.   \\"She doesn't have what's ours\\"     Incredible: Hands down the best song on the album. Love how the momentum builds up as the song progresses. Just an amazing dance song.   \\"Sex with you is . . . Incredible\\"     Beat Goes On: Looks like Madonna took her advice from the demo and tried something new. Although I liked the demo it felt like it was missing something. This version feels complete and Kanye's rap fits perfectly. Has a nice pop/urban sound to it.   \\"Don't sit there like some silly girl\\"     Dance 2night: This song is okay. I was expecting this song to be upbeat like 4 minutes. The lyrics are good though.   \\"You don't have to be beautiful to be understood\\"     Spanish Lesson: Very fun and upbeat. It's great to hear M singing some Spanish again. Although the translations aren't 100% correct it is still great to hear some \\"lessons.\\" This song really makes me want to get up and dance.   \\"Yo te quiero means I Love You\\"     Devil: Im glad that this song was finally conceived. Love the dark feel to it. Many compare it to Cry Me A River but I think that it is way better than River. Another great gem.   \\"I play right into it, who am I to criticize?\\"    Voices: Another dark track. Very haunting. Good lyrics and emotional ending. Very similar to the ending on Push.   \\"Who is the master & who is the slave?\\"     Ring My Bell: The pre-order track. This song is decent. Too bad it didn't make the final cut.     Remixes: The remixes are decent. I really like Junkie XL and the Oakenfold mix of Give it 2 me is amazing.     So here's the review.   Hope that you will enjoy the album like I am right now. Don't be quick to judge and   listen to the album. Forget the whole Timbaland & Co. and their attachment to the   album. Madonna definitely takes the wheel and the producers take the back seat. I   recommend this album to all fans, newbies, and anyone looking for a great workout   album. Remember to \\"Work up a sweat cause that's what music's for.\\"
0743455967|5.0|From rough draft to finished product, you see King's writing life develop into a fine story. King once again shows why he is a master story teller, even if the story is his own. A MUST read for writers no matter what stage in your career you are at. King does a fantastic job of showing you then telling you. This is very true for the last section of the book as he gives you an example of 1st draft \\"1408\\" and then the edited version with written notes. Several times I had to fight the urge to put the book down and get writing!<br />Another great part of this book is you truly get an appreciation of Stephan King the man; the love of his wife is very endearing.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves to read; you get a great story and a better understanding of how it's done.<br /><br />James A.

B00133KFGW|5.0|A young boy (Freddie Highmore) growing up in an orphanage dreams of being found by his parents and survives by his innate gift for and love of music. When he runs away to New York to find them, he takes up with a group of kid street musicians led by the sometimes nurturing, sometimes dangerous, and always exploitative Wizard (Robin Williams). Under Wizard's guidance, the boy takes on the name August Rush, and while in New York he hones his skills at a genius's pace in the hopes that his long lost parents will follow the music to find him. Meanwhile, only just discovering that her son did not die at birth, August's mother (Keri Russell) is already on the search with the help of a caring social worker (Terence Howard), while August's father (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is seeking to find her, the lost love he has never forgotten.     When I first saw trailers for \\"August Rush\\", I had no idea that it was based on \\"Oliver Twist\\", something that quickly became obvious when watching it. However, I also underestimated how touching it would be, and that's even though I expected it to be very good from the get-go. Regardless of the fact that its story is predictable (if you know Oliver Twist at all) and slightly sappy (not as sappy as I was afraid it might be, though), this is one heck of a movie! It'll bring you to tears a lot. In fact, it'll send you up and down throughout as you root for August and his family to finally come together. But what makes this one so different than just being a modern-day Oliver Twist is the fact that August Rush is a musical prodigy, and this is well woven into the story and a huge part of it. It's significant enough to make the film as much about the love and magic of music as it is about modernizing a classic. So, don't be put off by the fact that the tale is an old one. The brilliant cast, music, and engaging story will soon have you forgetting that you're on a journey you've been through before.     The DVD is double-sided for widescreen and fullscreen and comes with a selection of deleted scenes as the only bonus features. Definitely a must-see, and for many, a must-own.
B000068OSK|4.0|Ok... I'm that guy who shows up late to the party.<br /><br />I had been resisting the White Stripes for years due to the lavish and almost unfailing praise they have received by both press and listeners alike. On the surface it amounts to that type of nonsensical hero-worship normally associated with phonies like Coldplay. I mean, come on, how could anyone live up to such praise? Only insider connections or rabid flavor of the week/year journalism could produce such a uniform response, IMO.<br /><br />But I was wrong. And I'm happy about that.<br /><br />Anyway, what more can be said about the White Stripes that hasn't been said already? Like many of rock's greatest bands, TWS leap into the fray fulled formed and yet have plenty of room to grow. They<br />follow no formulaic pattern and at the same time recall many of rock's greatest moments. They take no prisoners... and are young enough to know everything.
0316143472|4.0|Ok, so Some people loved this book, some hated it and as a huge Sedaris fan I fall closer to the \\"loved it\\" end of the spectrum.  It has been a fun, if twisted summer read and I have laughed out loud several times.  OK, the twist?  Not as funny as some of his books (I still read Me Talk Pretty One Day anytime I need cheering up or feel like hurting myself laughing) but not quite as twisted as some of his other works, this is perhaps a slightly more mature Sedaris.  Still totally worth the read and just a light summer read for those that are not really into chick lit or testosterone driven novels.
0143038419|5.0|I usually don't feel the need to write a review, but after reading all the horrible reviews it got, I felt I had to. This book is amazing and incredibly funny! About a woman going through a divorce and trying to find herself. She does have some issues, but who doesn't? And if you think you don't, thats an issue! This book says to me that one thing that sounds good to someone else isn't so great for another. Her marriage sounded great to the average person, but being caught in something you don't want or isn't you is very destructive. It's about doing what you want and not having to justify it. Don't listen to all the bad reviews by people who probably give everything one star because they think everything is bad! I completely recommend reading this book if you want to laugh, find inspiration and yourself!
B00164DWEA|4.0|We already knew this Hulk would outdo the Ang Lee version (and how could it not?) and it does so on every level imaginable.  Edward Norton is considered a superior actor than Eric Bana, and sometimes that doesn't always make it a winner (Batman Forever anyone?) but in this case, Norton does the job right portraying Bruce Banner as he should.  Liv Tyler does the job of Betty Ross quite well (though Jennifer Connely wasn't bad either) and William Hurt's General Ross is easily more likeable than the Ross in the last film too.  In additon, we have Tim Roth as our main villain - Emil Blonsky - who in turn becomes \\"The Abomination\\" - finally, rejoice, an actual villain this time and it was a fine choice as represented by the comic books.  In addition to the change of characters, the story has a better feel this time around too, and actually takes itself quite a bit serious overall....there is little to no humor (unlike Iron Man, which I can't help compare this too either but more on that later) but there are several serious moments between Bruce and Betty, all well presented though never quite \\"moving\\".  The action and effects have all been upgraded and anyone who craves superhero battles will not be dissapointed when the Hulk goes up against the Abomination in the final scenes of the film.  And as a personal favorite, no more annoying directing giving a silly comic book feel as with Ang Lee's version - just one screen on the screen at all times - as the way it should be.<br /><br />Since Iron Man just came out about a month before Hulk and the two have some ties, I can not help but compare some.  Hulk is no Iron Man...overall Iron Man is arguably one of the finest superhero films made - probably in the top 5 in my opinion.  Hulk carried the action a little better, but everything else goes to Iron Man.  If you haven't learned already, Marvel is looking to do an Avengers film by the year 2011....connections are already being made and you'll see a little treat at the end of Hulk (just make sure you have seen Iron Man first).<br /><br />I doubted the Hulk could ever make it as a superior comic book film, since his comic book character never featured quite the depth of many of our other heroes, but I can't see any other Hullk film outdoing this one.  Marvel seems to have gotten it right again, and here's hoping that Captain America and Thor (releases around 2010) keep it up and lead us right into the Avengers film.  If you have not seen Ang Lee's version of Hulk - don't....this is the version to go by.

B0018QCXH8|2.0|I'm shocked to see that the overwhelming majority of reviewers are giving this movie a five star review.  Why?  The movie does look stunning, and the acting of Daniel Day Lewis is superb.  The movie is well done, but the ever important story is not.      Lewis' character in this film is Daniel Plainview.  He's a loner and an ambitious beyond belief (really) oil tycoon.  He is evil and somehow gets away with being evil unchallenged by anyone.  He embarasses the town's preacher multiple times, yet no one in the town seems to care.  He kills a man and no one bothers to ask what happened to him.  In the end, he is so drunk that he can hardly stand, yet once he does rise, he drinks a lot more and then is able to chase around a sober man and beat him to death.  These story flaws ruin the movie.  There is very little drama here - just one bad deed by Daniel after another.  No explanation why he is the way he is.  We know nothing of the man even after having to watch him for over 2 1/2 hours other than that he apparently loathes everyone - including himself.      The attention to detail was remarkable.  The oil rigs were authentic as were the townspeople.  This movie could have been a very good look at the heart and soul of a robber baron in the early 20th century, but instead was nothing more than a cheap shot at ambition.  Unfortunately this movie joins a growing list of movies that could have been great, but chose not to be.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Most programs by necessity or for greater profit cut corners constantly.  That's not an accusation but rather a reality of our times.  Firefly was an remarkable exception.  Costumes looked like clothes instead of fabric cut 10 minutes before shooting, actors looked rehearsed and ready, scenes were crisp and the writing was top notch.  Special effects looked dazzling, well thought out and new.<br /><br />Unfortunately those standards were also its downfall as Fox reviewed the costs of a show that didn't appear to have the immense following it would have later on.  The phrase 'before its time' is thrown around a lot but I'm going to use it again.  Many shows that put that kind of effort into quality production are gaining ground, but sadly they had to climb over the corpse of Firefly to do so.  We may never see Firefly's resurrection but I'm glad to know that those of us who have shown our love for this diamond have helped bring credibility to quality in television again.
B00133KDM8|5.0|I'd like to say...Nightwish has really taken a hold on me. Every album they have is amazing...including their newest work \\"Dark Passion Play\\". Their style of hard rock just amazes me. There is about every element in music stashed into their songs. The only difference between Nightwish's previous discography and \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is the loss of the greatest female vocalist of all time. Although Anette is a decent singer; she could never take place of the operatic styling's of Tarja. This girl is truly amazing and very gifted.    After she was forced to leave Nightwish, she decided to walk alone, under her own name, and still keep the operatic metal alive. This album may not be as catchy and riff-heavy as, say..\\"Once\\", but it still is amazing. Honestly, anything this girl sings will always be amazing. I read a few bad things about her cover of Alice Cooper's \\"Poison\\"; which in my mind, is intelligent and original. I guess people don't appreciate it because it is a little different from the classic. I would encourage this album, along with anything else she creates, onto anyone rock fan, opera fan, metal fan...anyone. Not only is Tarja possibly the prettiest girl to ever sing behind a microphone, but she definitely is one of the most talented.     This album is a lot darker than her previous work in Nightwish, but it fits her singing very well. There are other head banging songs as well though...including \\"Ciaran Swell\\", which shows she can still sing with a very heavy band behind her. After you purchase this disc, I suggest you check out Nightwish's work with her, and pick up the DVD, \\"End Of An Era\\" and watch one of the greatest singers of all time do her thing. You will not be disappointed.
0786948523|1.0|A successful company will identify what about it's product is 1) recognizable by the consumer, 2) successful and generated positive image and sales and, 3) needing improvement.      The new MM follows in the same flawed footsteps of the other core 4th books.  Instead of trying to improve on their \\"brand\\" product (which generally agreed had it's main success in the 3.5 rule set) they attempt an entire rules/style revision and become an entirely different product.  Most successful companies will tell you that will kill your \\"brand\\".     \\"Examine your company's history and figure out how it was branded in the past. Then revitalize the original message, putting your own twist on it. Reemphasizing the message that inspired and unified your firm's original customers won't alienate them.\\"  If we go by this...what WoTC is telling me is that they want to abandon it's original fanbase who made the D&D a success up to the 3.5 edition, in an attempt to strike out in an entirely new direction, hoping that an entirely redesigned brand product will tap into the MMO market's larger fanbase as potential new customers.    It seems a decision made simply to satisfy the shareholders, and not one at all made for the RPG community.  The same mindset has been carried over into the new MM.  Gone are the great descriptions, gone are the non-combat critters who used deception and trickery in favor of a big club, and gone are any other concerns other than stats/powers...it reads more like a recipe book serving up lists of ingredients that went into making the dish, but with no description as to which order to mix them, what temperature to use and how long to bake them.  People can claim \\"it's up to the GM's imagination to make the critter his own\\"....but if the critter lacks even the most basic of visual description I wonder what the GM paid for.  If the book emits the lush descriptions, reduces the critters all to basic combat obstacles and yet the books are still priced in the same manner as previous editions - then yes you guess it - you've been had.    IN regards to the MM and to the 4th edition as a whole - WoTC, get your head out of your *** and start trying to repair your brand right now.  Classic RPG fans require a game made by RPG fans, for RPG fans...not by a new generation of MMO player who has no idea what a pencil n paper RPG system should be.  The target 13 yr old audience will soon realize' as they get older, they want something more thought out and engaging than the 4th edition serves up.    I applaud the initiative of wanting to completely redfine your product brand..but when it is done with apparently no feedback taken from your current consumer base in development, then you reap what you sow.  I smell manure.
B000URDEB0|3.0|The material on this album is solid, the band plays solid, and the vocals are decent. I'm all for trying different things musically, but no one will ever be able to top Tarja's vocals on all the other Nightwish albums. After she left, they truly did lose one of the greatest singers of all time. I will admit, the vocals are not bad on this disc, and the whole album is enjoyable. I just cannot help to wonder how much better it would have sounded with Tarja on board. Check out Tarja's solo work \\"My Winter Storm\\" under her own name. It's quite amazing, and will hopefully leave you as breathless as it did to me. Also, pick up \\"End of An Era\\"; Tarja's last outgoing with the band...it is one amazing performance from some of the greatest musicians on the planet. These guys truly made a spot in my favorite band slot.
0385338082|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Emma, the main character is a responsible, thrifty person, who confronts difficult situations straight on and is not afraid to speak her mind.  (Very opposite of Becky Bloomwood from the Shopaholic series that I also loved so much.)  Emma is smart, witty and equally, if not more lovable.    The audio version is narrated by Emily Gray, one of my favorite narrators.  She makes this book even more enjoyable, if that's possible.  I found myself laughing out loud.    I know this is a \\"one off\\" book, with no plans for a series, but I really would love to see more on Emma and Jack.  I would love to see a sequal.  One of my top fun reads and will definetly read this one again.
1400082773|5.0|Barack Obama's autobiography or \\"coming of age\\" memoir of his childhood and young adulthood is a wonderful read--engrossing, inspiring--it reads like a novel in its intensity.  The influences on the maturing of this young black/white man seem to make him a man of the future: one of multi-ethnicity, multicultures, at home all over the world with all nationalities of people as well as people in every economic and social group, knowing Christian and non-Christian religions, fluent in several languages and from all this, developing a gift for communication, inspiration and leadership.  His strong values of honesty and compassion derive from direct experience while young and role modeling of strong elders.  This is a book that people can enjoy, regardless of political affiliations and Obama comes across as a man people can't help but admire for strength, commitment, perception and the one characteristic of all humans--\\"hope.\\"
0553385461|3.0|Yeah, there is some interesting things in here. It is quite accessible to the lay reader like me. By the end though it is either too simplified or it is just a bunch of gobbleligook. I was left wondering, do people really believe this stuff? P-branes and super strings. Yeah, baby.
1932907009|4.0|\\"Save the Cat\\" is essentially a guide to writing mainstream American-style movies. It provides common-sense advice, the sort of stuff you don't think of in spite of the fact that it's glaringly obvious, and this advice is presented in a conversational, easy to follow manner. I enjoyed reading this book and I think it will help me. However, as with any writing book, I will be taking the advice with a grain of salt.     My greatest reservations about this book are with regards to the chapter in which Snyder states that every (mainstream) movie ever made can be classified into one of 10 basic genres. In order to prove his point, Snyder does some pretty impressive mental gymnastics, but I'm still not convinced. I'm sorry, but I still can't manage to accept the suggestion that \\"M*A*S*H\\" and \\"American Beauty\\" are both \\"the same film\\". Furthermore, although his \\"beat sheet\\" (a basic outline that can supposedly apply to any film) is impressive, after having watched a couple of movies with this in mind, I've found that trying to align them with this outline is not as easy as Snyder would make you believe.     In answer to the question that is on your mind, yes, if you're an aspiring screenwriter (or any type of fiction writer, as I believe this advice to be universal), this book is worth buying. It's better that a lot of other writing books that I have read and Snyder has sold a number of the screenplays that he has written, making him a more qualified teacher than most of the writers of these such books. However, don't treat this book as the Bible. Take with you the advice that helps and leave the rest.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Fantastic set, great extras and wonderful transfer of film to DVD.  I would recommend this over the Blu Ray release, even if you have a Blu Ray player, as the quality isn't that much better, and it's around 50% cheaper.<br /><br />Go for it!  You deserve it!<br /><br />MC White says:  Check it out!
0452289963|5.0|I loved reading this book. I enjoyed reading a few pages a day over a period of time, to let it sink in. To some degree it is a repackaging of ancient teachings which many of us are already aware of. That being said, it is also a great reminder of those teachings, in a fresh package. I am impressed by the helpful effect it has on people, and happy to hear that Oprah is promoting it. I am a therapist in Marina del Rey, and some clients had been quoting this book. Then a copy was handed to me by a friend who was passing them out at a birthday dinner. What is interesting to me is that it seems to give men, in particular, a language for understanding their life struggles in terms of ego.It seems to pave the way for meaningful personal work. I can say that the book makes my job easier!  Kate Boswell
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I'll just start off by saying that I was fortunate enough to sit front row at this concert. It was definitely the best concert I have ever been to. This is pertinent because I witnessed it live and have now seen it in recorded form. I must say, that this film accurately and genuinely captures the magic and electricity of that night.   The film is amazing as well. I say film, because it's not just a concert video. There are also bits of commentary and insight from John Mayer. This, combined with the inspiring cinemaphotography, precise editing, and the great music itself, makes for a rediculously enjoyable experience. Even if you are not a fan of Mayer's music, you'll have to agree that this is simply a great film, based on the high production quality alone. I, like many others, am a huge live music fan and own many concerts on DVD, Blu-Ray, CD, etc., but this beautiful example of \\"pure\\" art certainly ranks at the top and anyone would be doing a disservice to themselves by not adding it to their collection.
B000YAA68C|4.0|This movie should come with a warning label-- \\"box of tissues required.\\" An amazing story of how to live and love and not waste time with those we love.
B00004R9A4|4.0|I remember watching this movie everytime it came on TV (no DVD's/videos back then)!  It's nice to share old school Disney with my kids.  You even get a little history with the make believe.  I STILL love this movie.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams is an entertaining history lesson.  It is a very well-done production with enjoyable acting.  Paul Giamatti is incredible in this role.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|This album was great.     I would suggest it for any metal music lovers. The drumming has improved alot, the speed is so much better than the last couple and the band has truly come together in the best way possible on this cd.    Welcome thrash kings, welcome real metal, welcome scream souls.    Buy it, Never regret.
0061122416|3.0|Coehlo's prose is simple and eloquent and in the first pages there is a promise of a riveting story about self-discovery. However, it turns out Coehlo's new-age message is old, almost cliche.  I kept thinking of the Alchemist as Obi-wan and Santiago as a slightly less annoying Luke Skywalker.  I felt the climactic scene was when Santiago \\"transformed\\" into the wind, but even that reminded me of a children's book.. that one where the little bunny says he'll run away from the mother bunny but she says she'll transform herself into the wind or other elements to find him?  So in that way, I found the book beautiful in its simplicity, irritating in its \\"spiritual message\\" and disappointing as its plot fell flat after Santiago left the crystal shop.  Oh well... after all, there is \\"nothing new under the sun...\\"
B0018AK9RA|1.0|Simply say that this Album stretching into two discs.The one stars are for Rob and him vocal work.    I am remembering 2 good songs in 23 songs.    All the keyboards remind me of \\"Turbo\\",but at half speed.I wish I can buyed  real Judas cd and many years to rock. NOT to hear a \\" garbage opera\\".     Sorry,real disappointed...     Be far from this cd.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|The Pixar crew seems to raise the bar every time they bring us a new animation. \\"Wall-E\\" is no exception. This time, we have a children's movie, ecofable, consumerist caution, a little engine that could (for seven hundred years at a stretch), duty and loyalty, and a lot more.<br /><br />First, of course, we have Wall-E himself. Ever since \\"Luxo Junior,\\" Pixar has led the field in bringing odd little inanimate objects to life. Here, the Wall-E character is a hard-working robot, battered and scuffed. He trundles to work every day, patiently cleaning up the millenial trash-heap left behind when people decided they had messed Earth up too much to live there anymore. In addition to the sad collection of tarnished treasures he finds in the litter, his dumpster-diving collects the hoard of spare parts that save his battered carcass from collapse.<br /><br />Then, into this Cinderella life, Princess Charming arrives, a white knight on a fiery steed, and carrying one heck of a lance. You'll just have to see the rest yourself - this really defies easy summary. Stereotypes keep coming up, like the evil grand vizier undermining the lawful ruler, but always with twists that keep them fresh. And, in the end, there are happy endings all around.<br /><br />No one will come to this movie for subtle sophistication. Still, this movie offers plenty to the grown-ups who paid for the tickets. It's a kids' movie, but not just for kids.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
0757307272|5.0|This book was perfect for my daughter who is struggling to figure out what life is all about.  Once she started reading this book, she couldn't stop talking to me about what the book said.  The book really helped her understand things that I couldn't help her with.  I am very happy that I purchased this book for my daughter.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has a teenage that is struggling to figure out life.

Chapter by chapter she takes you  in baby steps so as not to overwhelm you...as housework can tend to be  very overwhelming......not with Marla...believe me, if you will just  give this book a chance - read a chapter each day - you will be amazed.  I had tried everything!!!  I didn't even know about the book until a  friend referred me to [...] can assure you that if you  read this book, you will NEVER have to do spring housecleaning again.
0452289963|5.0|This book has totally changed and transformed my life.  I had always felt deep down differently about a lot of things and suddenly it all came together with a sudden whoosh.  I would highly recommend this book to anybody who is searching for \\"meaning\\" in their life or have issues with depression or general unhappiness with their life.

0767821769|4.0|I just rented this because I was interested in seeing more movies with Julia Roberts, one of my favorite Hollywood actresses.  i think she is beautiful and really gets into her parts.  \\"Step Mom\\" is one of her best films.  I'm not really a big Susan Sarandon fan but she was good in this movie.  It revolves around the lives of the step mother conflcting with the mother from the previous marriage.  The kids in this movie help liven up the movie and unfortunately havent been in any big name future films since.  Jackie ends up getting cancer later in the movie which will bring tears to your eyes in some scenes.  Isabel (Julia Roberts) is pretty much an artsy photographer who is considered \\"hip\\" by Jackie, the mother of the children.  They have to put up with Isabel's poor motherhood instincts like accidentally \\"losing\\" one of the children in one scene.  Later in the movie you grow to like both mothers.  Even the father Luke gets likeable later in the movie as his character becomes more real.  The cast of the movie is pretty talented.  This is one of the better films Julia Roberts has been in.  While \\"The Pelican Brief\\" is my all-time favorite of hers, \\"Stepmom\\" is still worth watching even though it's an older movie.  Warning: if you're emotional be sure to bring some tissues with you while watching it.  Definately worth the price.
0061537934|5.0|Enzo, a philosopher-dog with terrier/lab origins, has one wish: to be reincarnated as a human. Enzo's owner, Denny, is a semi-professional race car driver who talks to him like he's his equal, so Enzo is well-versed in the art of racing, particularly in the rain. Enzo and Denny watch in-car race videos of Denny's races, and the rest of Enzo's education comes from countless hours of television (some educational, some not).<br /><br />Enzo admits that he's frustrated by his lack of ability to communicate with humans, from his too-floppy tongue that fails to form words to his lack of opposable thumbs that won't allow him to open doors. He tries to conquer his animal instincts around Denny's young daughter Zoe (no biting and no chasing), and struggles to love Denny's wife Eve, whom he sees as competition. When multiple tragedies strike Denny's home, Enzo is as supportive as he can be under the circumstances. Towards the end of his life, he is reflective about his mission on earth, and looks forward to being reincarnated as a human, so he can finally talk to Denny as a man instead of barking incoherently.<br /><br />Enzo is a funny, observant narrator, who, although not book-learned (he was never able to teach himself to read), is intelligent, articulate, and has a wicked sense of humor (jalapenos plus obnoxious in-laws plus expensive Berber carpet, for example). His deep insights into human (and canine) nature ring true, especially when he is the only other witness to an incident that nearly ruins Denny's life, and Enzo plays a role in reversing Denny's rock-bottom fortunes.<br /><br />Delightfully told, The Art of Racing in the Rain is an outsider's look at what makes humans tick, as well as an ode to the art of Formula One and racing. It's a love song to the simple pleasures in life (walking in Seattle's drizzle, stretching out on a sun-warmed sidewalk) and the bonds we forge with those around us. Truthfully, most of the time I kept forgetting that Enzo was even a dog, although he does talk about his early puppyhood at a Washington farm, for Enzo is determined to shed his canine form for a human one, and this includes his thinking processes and actions (as his hips gradually deteriorate, he finds ways to mask his limp so that Denny doesn't suspect). The novel's ending may be a bit too sweet for some, but I found it to be a perfect ending to a tale that only Enzo could tell. Stein's rich, evocative language and heart-tugging storyline involving Enzo's family will be sure to delight fans of [[ASIN:0060817097 Marley & Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog]] and other dog-themed novels.lk about his early puppyhood at a Washington farm, for Enzo is determined to shed his canine form for a human one, and this includes his thinking processes and actions (as his hips gradually deteriorate, he finds ways to mask his limp so that Denny doesn't suspect).

B000002KOG|5.0|Some might find this recording archaic and dated.  I could not disagree more.  Personally, I think other words express it best--nostalgic, disillusioned, timeless.      I was a Buffalo Springfield fan during those incredible years, and because of where I lived, I found myself limited to what small record stores had to offer in the 60's. I did not have the chance to hear these songs until 1973.      The music reminds me of certain elements of Buffalo Springfield.      Combinations of keyboard and guitar achieve this on many of the recording's songs, but most importantly, the effect happens not because Neil is somehow imitating a sound like his former band, but it occurs because Neil artistically expresses key elements that were a part of that incredible band's sound.      Listening to the songs takes me back.  It reminds me of my youth.    Are there dark elements? Personally, I think all great music and poetry have to have this, because the muse sometimes lurks in shadows.  I guess I never liked music that didn't express passion, and that can not happen if a recording is a trite reproduction of any generation's \\"pop\\" inclinations.  Neil's music has never been that.  And that is why I will always be a fan.    Because the recordings on this album affect me like they do, I see it as timeless; I see it as a \\"must have\\" purchase.      There is not a single song on the CD that I would not want to hear.  It is an incredible view of an icon's emergence into solo work.
6304712499|2.0|I watched \\"Spawn\\" when it first came out, and for a 9-year-old kid in 1997, it was nothing short of epic. A recent re-viewing, however, was particularly damaging to the action spectacle that I had kept in my memory, and I'm sorry to say that I'm no longer a fan of the film. Based on comic guru Todd McFarlane's magnum opus of the same name, \\"Spawn\\" was largely a showcase of what you could achieve with special effects and CGI animation ten years ago; needless to say, the near-monthly ascension of such technology has left the film almost completely obsolete in this day and age. With no memorable acting and a storyline that was recently reworked into \\"Ghost Rider\\", I'd think that the only fans of the films were those that saw it when it first came out and continue to put up with it.<br /><br />Al Simmons (Michael Jai White, [[ASIN:B00003CXW4 Exit Wounds]]) is a deadly mercenary deceived into furthering the political agenda of evil corporation-owner Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen, [[ASIN:B000HC2LI0 The West Wing: The Complete Series Collection]]). Upon discovering all the trouble he's unknowingly been causing, Simmons wants out, but is double-crossed and murdered by Wynn, who is in cahoots with a demonic clown (John Leguizamo, [[ASIN:0790731894 Executive Decision]]) eager for Simmons' soul. Following a pact with the devil and a five-year internment in hell, Simmons returns to earth to find the life and world he knew long gone, with the clown gleefully enticing him to bring on the apocalypse. Only by regaining his humanity with the aid of a mysterious wizard (Nicol Williamson, [[ASIN:6305558167 Excalibur]]) can he foil the plans of hell and protect the family he was forced to leave behind.<br /><br />If you're going to watch \\"Spawn\\", pick up the director's cut - the theatrical release is relentless in its \\"let's-make-it-watchable-for-teens\\" homogeny: cuts and voiceovers galore, etc. However, even with the inserted cursing, sexual references, and increased violence of the unrated version, the film is in trouble: moving at a breakneck pace that allows no room for character development, the acting - especially Sheen's performance - is left looking extremely hammy, and the numerous action scenes are no more than showcases for what the SFX department can up with (i.e. the ballroom and chase scenes mainly highlight Spawn's animated cape) - in other words, there's no substance behind the shootouts, chases, and fisticuffs. Co-stars Theresa Randle ([[ASIN:0790749858 Space Jam]]), Melinda Clarke ([[ASIN:B000UJ48O0 The O.C.: The Complete Series Collection]]), and D.B. Sweeney ([[ASIN:B000053VB0 The Cutting Edge]]) aren't given all too much time to add to the story, so more or less, they're just there to fill in the roles occupied in the comic.<br /><br />If the film does have a definitive asset, it's Leguizamo's performance: with the help of a truckload of makeup and prosthetics, he brings the Clown to life with a dirty grace and soiled charm that even the comics or later animated series were unable to capture. In addition, the Violator (Clown's monstrous alter-ego) is just about the best animation in the movie: its three scenes are highlights of the film, some of which still look decent today.<br /><br />Sadly, these two fellows only make up so much of the movie, and thus, we're left with the comic book-style pacing, a rather lacklustre Spawn costume (White's makeup is cool, but without the cape, he looks rather diminutive), and the overabundance of dated CGI. The scenes in hell are particularly difficult to watch to folks who have seen \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", and previous jaw-droppers like Spawn crashing through the ceiling at the ball will now qualify as \\"ho-hum\\" in quality.<br />Since \\"Spawn\\", director Mark Dipp&eacute; has been forced into strict TV and DTV work, and Nicol Williamson has yet to appear in another film: how much this actually has to do with the contents of the movie is unsure, but it's poetic to think that \\"Spawn\\" proves the point that even the best-funded of movies cannot rely solely on technology to leave a mark in cinema history. Give it a shot if you're a fan of the likes of [[ASIN:B001AK3S4Y Hellboy]] or \\"Blade\\" - non-action fans, however, steer clear.en the best-funded of movies cannot rely solely on technology to leave a mark in cinema history.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Nobody would have expected Coldplay to be around for as long as they have. I remember even Chris Martin once declaring that Coldplay would release 2 records before calling it quits, referencing Joy Division as an influence. It's been 8 years since their debut album Parachutes propelled the band to international superstardom, and Coldplay have just released their 4th album.     Viva La Vida is a continuation of their last effort, the breathtaking 2005 release X&Y; a collection of soothing soft rock tracks with apparent influeces from U2 and Radiohead.     Viva begins with an instrumental teaser, Life in Technicolor, which I hoped would have been longer and with lyrics. What I found interesting about the first track is that it begins where the last minute or so of the final track ends, so if you listen to the entire album on a loop, you're going to hear a continuous musical pattern. What follows Technicolor is a string of incredible songs that I instantly found myself loving: the mind blowing Cemetaries of London, the potential hit single Lost!, the elusive piano driven 42, which echoes the sounds on Parachutes, the remarkable hit single and title track Viva La Vida which took me some time to get used to, and the harder edged single Violet Hill. Other tracks include the album closing epic Death and All his Friends, which starts slow before the drums and guitar kick in, but then slows down again and never really takes off. There's also Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love and Strawberry Swing which suffer the same fate; however, the former, Lovers in Japan, does feature Middle Eastern orchestration that I enjoyed a lot.     Viva La Vida, like its predecessor, sounds and looks good overall, but falls short in some tracks. It seems like Coldplay won't ever be able to rival their second and best album to date, A Rush of Blood to the Head. It also sems that Coldplay won't be giving up anytime soon. Keep expecting great things from them in the future, but for now, enjoy La Vida!B-
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I only recently watched this for the first time. I know people and critics rave about it constantly, and I was curious to see if all that praise was justified. Well, I saw it and yes, its an extremeely good film. The acting is flawless, the script hole-free and really keeps you interested throughout the whole film. The story is a simple, but engaging one and I really could find no fault with it whatsoever. That said, I'm not sure if I would call this the greatest film ever, or even in the top three, but its certainly up there. I was debating whether to give it 4 stars or 5. While I loved the film, I didn't REALLY love it, but for such a flawless film, I finally settled on the 5 star rating, which is something I don't do that often. If there is anyone who has not seen this yet(like me up til a few days ago) I would definately recommend you watch this.
0312323867|5.0|I loved this book! I think Darcy just makes you really think about yourself... at least it did with me, loL! I think everything that happened to her was for one reason only, and that was to make her turn her life around to be a better person. After reading this book, I really like Darcy... despite the fact that I hated her on Something Borrowed.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|the \\"final cut\\" wasn't that great, in my opinion.  Not really bad, but the changes were pretty minimal, the most memorable of which was a longer, more gory version of a scene that I thought worked fine in the \\"Director's Cut\\".    Of course here you get both of these versions, plus several others, in a sharp-looking HD transfer, plus loads of extras, for just over 20 bucks.  It's hard to go wrong, especially with one of the great early masterpieces of cyberpunk cimema, and probably the best film adaptation of a Philip K. Dick story to date.
0061537934|5.0|I haven't read a book in a day for years but I did with this one. I don't know if it's the fact that I'm a huge dog lover (and have an aging dog like Enzo) or just the fact that it's written so well but I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book. When I finished I literally sat there and sobbed (I get teary even writing this!) I'll never look at one of my dogs again without wondering if they're lusting for my opposible thumbs, or meeting another person and wonder who's dog they used to be. I actually bought a \\"loaner\\" copy of the book to pass out to friends so I don't have to part with my first edition signed by Mr Stein.  Like Enzo, \\"beware of the zebra\\" in your life!  ;-) Thank you, Garth Stein, for a wonderful story!!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This movie is absolute perfection. There is nothing I don't like about it. I laughed, I cried. This is one of those movies that everyone needs to see. It is filled with characters that are brilliantly acted and quickly become people we know. It moves swiftly and powerfully from comedy to drama and back again.<br /><br />If this film doesn't touch your heart, you need to check to be sure you're still breathing.
B000EXDS5M|3.0|This is a very entertaining and delightful western to watch.    If you are looking for historical value and true-to-life realism in your western, then this might not be your best option.  Other than the fact that the two main actors are called Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, and they rob trains, and they end up going to South America and rob banks, there isn't a whole lot of hardcore truth and factual events that you could point to in this movie and say with conviction that these were the true final days of BC & SK.    With that being said, let's not forget that this was made in 1969.  The movie itself looks about the same as many westerns being put out on television during that period - a bit campy and certainly more concerned with style and how well it looked, rather than telling the hardcore-gritty story of the two bandits.  The movie comes off as a very Hollywood-ish story that devotes more focus on making sure that the viewer was going to like BC & SK, (or specifically Newman & Redford) than it did on the subject of the story itself.  Watch and see if you don't think that this film is a case of Newman and Redford - playing themselves, as cowboys, then it does as them playing the cowboy characters.    As for entertainment value - this is an awesome movie.  It has plenty of cute one-liners and certainly repeatable lines (Who are these guys!?), funny and delightful moments, and plenty of time (film) devoted to making you feel all warm and fuzzy about the last pair of true western outlaws to grace the western hemisphere.    I would certainly not rate this in my top ten list of western movies, but that is because I look for more realism and reality in my movies than I do for artistic relevance and screen-appeal of the actors.  I would however rate this as being a movie that most people will really enjoy and get a kick out of seeing.  It's the type of movie that you SHOULD see, and will be happy that you did.  It will also appeal to those who want a taste of the late 60's early 70's style of making and presenting a movie - the musical score - the wide to zoom shots - the starry shots of presenting a pretty girl (Katherine Ross), etc.  All those crafts and that particular style of movie-making is now gone.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I can't believe this movie receives so many poor reviews. While it is not Scorsese's best, it is still very impressive and quite epic. Howard Hughes remains a mysterious character whose biographies are usually based on speculation rather than truth. Scorsese has done an amazing job of showing one adaptation of Hughes' life from his ambitious beginnings as a filmmaker to his later contributions to the world of aviation. Due to another impressive performance from DiCaprio, Hughes' obsessive-compulsive disorder is shown as both his biggest fault and at times his biggest asset. But the most impressive acting in the film is Cate Blanchett's role as Katherine Hepburn, one of the most famous (and yet still mysterious) actresses in movie history. Blanchett is very convincing as Hepburn, almost as if she had found some way to become possessed by Kate Hepburn's spirit as she frolicked through each of her scenes with biting wit and attractive charm that is shared by both Hepburn and Blanchett, winning her the Oscar she deserved for this role. All together a great film with some stunning visuals, outstanding performances, and a time capsule glimpse into movie history, a film you may want to watch again and again.<br /><br />I can't believe this movie receives so many poor reviews.

0307237702|5.0|I often hear folks complain that Obama is all talk and no detail.  I had thought that myself and sought some more information.  This book provides insight into Obama's thinking on issues from the political process to the economy and from religion to education.  It provides the logic behind the ideas he offers from the stump and provides a glimpse into his complex thinking that is tough to get at in today's environment where ideas have to fit into the 12-second sound clips of the evening news.  If you are on the fence about Obama or if you just want some more details about this man's thinking, this book is a must read.
B000MZHW4A|5.0|I may be alone here, but this is really one of the best films of 2006. Loads of action, bits of melodrama, and amazing performances from Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy and especially Leonardo DiCaprio as smuggler Danny Archer. This is the kind of role DiCaprio needed to prove his talent.<br /><br />As usual with Zwick films, there just isn't enough time for him to tell the tale he is supposed to tell. The film would be better if only a little longer. Instead, much of the intended plot is drowned out by the action (which is still impressive). And, in order to give the impression of how Africans were victimized, the screenwriters chose to make Solomon and his family the victims of nearly everything that befalls many African citizens: slavery, child abduction, exile. The movie does get a little preachy, but not so much that it overwhelms the viewer.<br /><br />In spite of its faults, Blood Diamond is powerful and unforgettable, a movie to watch again and again for its pulse-pounding action, unbelievably talented performances, and important look at a more recent dark part of African history.
B000002GA8|5.0|I was so excited to see this on CD.  I still have the album from the 70's.  It was just as I remembered, and so fitting to buy it now, with the movie coming out soon!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Awesome movie! If you've never watched Stargate though, don't start with this. Go back and watch the SG-1 seasons first.
B000ELJBAA|4.0|Nice to hear what the real driving force behind Pink Floyd can do solo. Gilmour's guitar work has always been exceptional, but it really shine in some of the truly \\"rocking\\" tunes from this disc. If you like \\"Floyd\\" without Waters (and that's not difficult for me), then you'll love this disc.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|The one word that probably best describes the HD recreation of the first season of TOS is: WOW! The difference between the \\"original\\" Original Series and this HD version are breathtaking.  If Gene Rodenberry were alive I believe that he would have been very pleased indeed with tremedous work and effort that went into each episode to make the improvements made possible with present day technology and yet remain faithful to orignial storyline and content. The extra detail, new effects and deeper colors are almost too good to be true.  I can not say enough good things about this restoration.  I just wish HD could have hung in there long enough to get seasons three and four finished.  One can only hope for a BluRay version.  This one is definately worth getting!
078322737X|5.0|If there is anyone who was into cars back in the early 60's, this is for you. George Lucas served up some really good memories with this one. This was cruising in \\"Anytown, USA\\". Most anyone you talk to, who was alive and kicking in this time frame, will recall some of the events shown in this movie. Simply good fun to watch, and some fairly \\"harmless\\" gags too. Just goes to show that you don't have to shoot anyone to have some fun.
B0015F1VY8|2.0|I enjoy watching Cate Blanchett usually, and enjoy historic movies and documentary type movies, but this one put me to sleep.
B000GG4Y32|5.0|I'm an undergraduate in history at Harvard, and I've studied the Russian Revolution with some degree of depth, but all the books in the world could never succeed in doing what \\"Reds\\" did for me, which was truly to give me a feeling for what it FELT like to experience those events.  The political atmosphere, the material environments, all of these are meticulously (and rather accurately) reproduced, and all of this is combined with a compelling narrative propelled by difficult personal and political choices that the main characters must make.      (Examples:  Support Woodrow Wilson or not?  Struggle for the revolution in the USA or Russia?  Concerning the Russian workers, whether going on strike will be a betrayal of their Russian soldiers and American allies, or whether that would be a comradely gesture that would set an example and ignite revolution around the whole world?  Accept the Bolshevik rationalizations for their dictatorial ways, or reject the Bolsheviks?  Etc.  The movie doesn't just pose such questions; the movie shows how ordinary people (soldiers, workers), as well as the main characters, wrestled with these questions, and the window into this history that the movie provides is simply fascinating.)    That's what truly makes the movie work:  the detail and sophistication given to the intricate political questions.  For these, the movie does not prescribe normative answers, only a view to how these particular characters responded.  I really do not understand the reviews arguing that \\"Reds\\" glorifies communism or the Soviet Union.  Reds includes plenty of hard-hitting skepticism and criticism of communism and the Soviet Union from the likes of Emma Goldman, Jack Nicholson's O'Neill, and some of the documentary-style witnesses.  It would have been much easier to make a movie that hammers a single, unified message into the viewer, but \\"Reds\\" doesn't do that.  Throughout, the movie constantly confronts the characters and viewers with tough questions:  was the revolution worth it?  Are Reed and Bryant deluding themselves, as O'Neill claims?  Which comes first, revolution or love?  Are they mutually exclusive?  What does it take for a person like Reed to balance between being an objective journalist, a creative artist, a partisan for his true political feelings, and a lover to his wife?  Questions like these (that the film never definitely tries to solve for the viewer) are what keep the viewer gripped to the movie and make every minute of the 3 and a half-hour movie worth it.  The only thing that this movie demands from the viewer is an open mind, and unfortunately it seems that that is too much to ask from some viewers.
B00164DWEA|2.0|Dear movie character Betty,  I understand that you dont want Bruce to be hurt. I also get that if it were up to you, you'll take away all his anger and put it some place very far so no one would find it. Let the man get mad and smash whatever interferes with him. Every time you're around he gets all googlie eyed and to be quite frank, I want to see some destruction not a soap opera. Listen cut it out and let this guy be the mindless hulk that he is.   Sincerely,  Movie Watcher
0385338724|4.0|I love this author, she's one of my favorites.  Reading her books is like watching a romantic comedy chic flick.  They're so funny, so witty, and so relatable.  You won't be able to put it down, making it a very fast read.
0374280967|5.0|The premise of this gorgeous novella is that the Queen, a woman previously devoid of hobbies, suddenly discovers the joy of reading. She starts seizing every opportunity to pick up a book - declaring a sick day or surreptitiously reading in the coach on the way to open Parliament. On walkabouts, instead of asking people whether they've come far, she asks them about what they're reading. This disconcerts and displeases almost everyone around her: her staff, her visitors, the Prime Minister, even her corgis (who get fewer walks).<br /><br />\\"The Uncommon Reader\\" is a deliciously funny book. (I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the Duke of Edinburgh.) The details are well researched and the premise somehow feels both totally believable and quite fantastic. It's a love letter to reading but also in a way a love letter to the Queen. Plus, the ending is perfect. It's a glorious book that only takes a couple of hours to read, but one of the best that I've read all year.
0671449028|5.0|Sandra Boynton's books are the PERFECT GIFT for baby showers....they are wonderfully rhythmic to read and babies love these! I always purchase these little board books for new parents who generally get all kinds of baby clothes etc. for showers but rarely get books to start a baby libary. You just can't go wrong with any of the books by Sandra Boynton, they beg to be read aloud!
B0012Q732O|1.0|Like most of you I'm an avid movie fan.  This is not a movie so much as it's a 2 hour nap put on film.  For the love of God watch anything, and I do mean anything, other that this garbage.  Primate looses girl to evil other primative, primate rescues girl. CAN YOU JUST FEEL THE EXCITEMENT!  Forget the fact that this film has all the historical accuracy of the Flintstones, (or Kansas public schools), the movie leaves you asking the question, \\"I spent 2 hours doing what?!\\"  Honestly, save your time and your money.  Just take a nap, same effect but you save some money and your dreams will almost certainly be FAR more entertaining.
1582701709|1.0|The secret is full of COMMON SENSE!!! It's like me writing a book saying \\"don't set your self on fire\\"  or \\"save money\\", ect.  Are we really this stupid that we NEED to read this???  You can get better advice from ready dear abby and her column is better written!!!
B000ZLFALI|1.0|Okay, I thought this might be a nice piece of film to sit back to and enjoy. I mean who doesn't like the music of The Beatles? It took me aback to see how horribly the actor's sang and how only the thinnest lines of melody where used in the instrumentation. Then there was the plot, or absence thereof... Take a bunch of Beatles songs mix them in a hat and write a script???  I shan't hurl invectives at the director or writers, but shame on those who think this is good cinema. It makes Cannibal: The Musical look dramatically deep.<br /><br />I thought it was a waste of a DVD disc. Someone could have used that disc to burn something worthwhile.<br /><br />Thoroughly disgusted and have lost two hours of my lifespan to fecal splattering.<br /><br />Only in Amerika
6305127646|1.0|Saints preserve us! Why, oh why, did they decide to butcher The Saint? The original series based on Charteris' novels and acted by a suave, debonair and above all _competent_ Roger Moore was highly enjoyable, and left us curious to see Simon Templar's most recent incarnation. You know what they say about curiosity...    Val Kilmer gives us a two-dimensional sociopath whose squinty-eyed attempts at acting leave one wishing the authorities would see through his flimsy \\"disguises\\" and lock him away to spare us the rest of this movie. The romance is cheesy, the \\"haunting past\\" borders on the absurd, the \\"evil Russian Mafia conspiracy\\" is painfully stereotypical, the script sounds like a bargain-bin reject, the plot holes are big enough to drive a truck through, the action sequences are the interminable \\"everyone is a superhero\\" variety that has become so pervasive - and at a 112-minute running time, it all plays out at excruciating length. The film could almost work as satire if it didn't take itself with such stilted seriousness.    It could have been just another forgettable generic action movie, but to attach it to a distinctive franchise and then give it NO resemblance to the original does nobody any favours. So if you like The Saint as a character or a series, do yourself one: Pass this movie by.
0143038419|1.0|Even if I overlook the fact that this book is NOT well-written, I have to agree with the previous post - the author really comes through as shallow and self-indulgent.  She made me not care about her (character) or the other people she talks about.    One of the things that bothered me the most is that though she persists in talking about her 'spiritual teacher', and meeting yogis, etc., she also on the SAME page talks about eating veal.  And she mentions veal several times in the first few chapters.  This may seems like a weird comment to some but I know many Buddhist people and non-Buddhist people who are working on their paths through yoga and meditation, and NOT one of them who is on the 'path to enlightenment' and makes trips to their Ashram eats meat, let alone makes fun of a teacher who would suggest vegetarianism as a life choice, LET ALONE eat veal, as this author does.    Sorry, she comes across as shallow and false.  Maybe she's not and maybe she did learn something.  If she did, I'd be scared to read her bio BEFORE this 'spiritual quest'.
0553573411|5.0|I agree with brannonc below when I say the book covers leave a LOT to be desired; I disagree with users like eryk and judah who view the good guys as wimps that repeatedly suffer at the hands of the bad guys in spite of having various powers like the Skill, the Wit, the King's support, etc. The one thing that really strikes me about this series is how realistic (an oxymoron for this genre I know) the protagonist's response to Regal's evil-doings is: nothing. It reminds me of stories that might take place in medieval Europe with peasants living under an unjust aristocracy. All you can do is watch and wait while bad things happen. Yes, Fitz is of royal blood, but only Shrewd's power shades him from the dangers of the court politics. This is realistic because everything is so clandestine. No matter how sweet it would be to simply throttle Regal's throat, a promise is a promise and Fitz and company need to rely on a cat and mouse game like the Cold War where everything happens backstage unseen to the general audience. If you read Le Carre spy novels or understand the CIA's proxy methods, then you will appreciate this novel and why the characters act (or don't act). However, if you don't have the patience for real character development or the intrigues/realities of the game of thrones, then skip ahead to Book 3 whose prologue sums up 1/2 of this novel in 2 pages.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|Definitely worth it. Great drama inside of course. With this price, you can't go wrong. I'll recommend to all of you.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|No, Vampire Weekend is no [[ASIN:B0002EQ7E2 Graceland]], but then what is? It's just not fair to compare the first album from an indie band with a big-budget production from a master of pop songwriting in his prime collaborating with some of the top musicians in Africa! Taken on its own terms, Vampire Weekend is a good effort that sometimes rises above the ordinary \\"indie\\" sound of the band's peers. When you average the brilliance of tracks like \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" with the same-old-stuff of tracks like \\"Walcott\\", you're left with a solid album that's still well worth a listen.<br /><br />Lyrically, Vampire Weekend might better be compared to Andrew Bird's recent work, with words chosen more for their sound than their meaning. Overall, I'm left more with the impression of a fun party album in the tradition of the B-52's than the enduring poetry of a Paul Simon masterwork. A bit disappointing, but still OK.
B000HBK3MM|3.0|The CD is just alright.  I only like a couple of the songs.  I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I found the puppets in this movie more life-like and interesting than the multi-million dollar puppets and CGI used in big blockbuster movies.  This movie isn't for children, but Trey and Matt are so childlike (not childish) in presenting the issues it really wasen't offensive at all. I found it sharp, witty, well detailed (loved the lit cigarette the puppet was holding), very original story, and pants wetting funny! Even the songs the characters sang were well written and to the point.  Keep up the good work, guys, a lot of your fans really appreciate it.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|this album Madonna's last offical one for warner brothers feels like she just went through the motions and worked with whomever was happening at the moment and said ok whatever. the combiantion of madonna with timberland and timberlake and also with pharell and others sounds like left over tracks that they did for others and madonna is just riding in the backseat for the ride and not adding anything to the table. marginal tracks and dime a dozen production along with her vocals just being there without any real feel of expression or anything standing out.
B000ZOXDG4|4.0|this is the movie I would make.    The story is oddly vacant and not really accurate, but the visuals are stunning, and you can't help but enjoy the purity of Blanchett's performance.    I rather fear that too many people will take this \\"MTV\\" account of Elizabeth's life seriously, and that's a shame. It's a bit like reading the Spark Notes to the Golden Age of England, or watching the Mel Gibson version of \\"Hamlet.\\" It's not BAD, but lord knows it's not accurate or deep. You're there for Mel in tights.    The same applies to Clive Owen. Edgy and divinely roguish in his role as Sir Walter Raleigh, he was certainly an eyeful of man candy. Again, his life was not entirely ACCURATE, but in a production such as this, I suppose that's neither here nor there: we are watching for ENTERTAINMENT.    If I really wanted ACCURACY, I'd watch the History Channel.    The costumes were beautifully done; the landscapes were gorgeous. Again, Blanchett MADE the movie worthy of attention, along with the cinematography and rich colors from artful contrasts and allusions.    I can't stop praising Blanchett's portrayal of Elizabeth. It is rich and complex, highlighting the solitude of a woman in power and trying to maintain her own against a male-dominated society and Houses. A society where her virginity is her biggest gambling chip against other countries. It was simply a brilliant portrayal!    I enjoyed this movie for what it was: \\"BASED\\" on the life of Elizabeth I. As we all know, that gives them license to \\"elaborate.\\" (Although, they just... well... snipped the tip of that time period.)    If you want accuracy, go elsewhere. For a bit of fantasy and simply breathtaking scenes, give this a go.
B00138J0KO|3.0|This album is very tough to evaluate without knowing exactly who is reading the review:  does one review it for the general music-buying public or fans of Pink Floyd/Roger Waters?  For the general public who just know Waters from Pink Floyd and only like the radio hits like \\"Money,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"Another Brick In The Wall,\\" I can honestly say there is next to nothing here for you.  Much as it pains me to admit it (because I am a big fan of Roger Waters), David Gilmour was right when he has stated that one of Roger's flaws is his willingness to simply repeat musical ideas over and over if that's what it takes to find room for all the lyrics he's written.  He's done that successfully on Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" with two versions of \\"Pigs On The Wing\\" and on \\"The Wall\\" with multiple takes on the \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\" theme, but on Animals the repeated tracks were very short (under 2:00) and on The Wall, each reprise of the lyrical \\"Brick\\" theme featured at least slightly different music.  He would do it again later on his 1992 solo album \\"Amused To Death\\" with three takes on the \\"What God Wants\\" lyrical theme, but again varied the music at least some on one of the reprises.    On Pros and Cons, this flaw of Roger's is on full display as much of the music is so repetitive and non-melodic as to make this album a pretty tough listen (Waters himself considers it flawed, calling it \\"a bit spotty\\").  On first listen, the only tracks with any potential to grab a casual listener would likely be \\"Sexual Revolution\\" (the most Pink Floyd sounding track...), the ballad \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" and perhaps the title track, which is burdened with nonsensical lyrics that make absolute no sense outside of the general concept of the album (and still don't make total sense within the framework of the concept).      The music here is expertly played by a backup band anchored by the legendary Eric Clapton on guitar and session-pro Andy Newmark on drums, but their skills are under-utilized.  Apart from the 3 songs mentioned previously, much of the rest of the music here is simply repetitive background music to the story Roger aims to tell.    Another flaw is that the concept of this album is far from immediately evident.  It centers on the dreams of our protaganist, with the time before each song representing the actual time of morning the dream occurs.  Throughout the story, \\"hitchhiking\\" is used as a metaphor for sexual freedom.  The character in the story dreams of a carefree relationship, only to settle down and have the burden of familiarity and routine intrude on his new relationship until his newfound love eventually leaves him for another.  In the end, in the \\"Moment of Clarity\\", our character awakens to find it was all a dream and that his original love is asleep next to him after all.      The themes in this are not quite diverse or universal enough to have a wide appeal which is why when given the choice, the other Pink Floyd members chose to develop and record The Wall instead of The Pros and Cons (Waters had written and done demos for both projects in 1978-79 and then gave the band the choice of which to make a Pink Floyd project). Between the weaker concept and the repetitive music, this is Waters' least appealing album with or without Pink Floyd excluding some of the pre-Dark Side of the Moon work he did with Pink Floyd, and it's a pretty safe bet that only hardcore fans will grow to like much (if any) of it.    That said, if you're willing to give this several listens, it does grow on you, particularly when the concept of the record is clear.  Waters has never been a great vocalist in the traditional sense, but here he does deliver some of his most heartfelt and angst-filled vocals with all the soul and passion anyone could possibly muster.  On Side 2 in particular as he sings of the deterioration of his relationship, one gets the sense that he's exorcising more than a few demons from the breakup of his own marriage afew years before.    In one moment he sounds genuinely sad, as in \\"For the First Time Today, Pt 1\\":    For the first time today   I feel it's really over   You were my everyday excuse   For playing deaf, dumb and blind   And who'd have ever thought   This was how it would end for you and me...      In the very next song, he's near physically ill as he ponders the man that stole his love:    With his neat feet   And his clean fingernails   With his wise but twinkling eyes   He's a rock standing out in an ocean of doubt   And compromise   I'd like to go on with this bit of a song   Describing this schmuck   I'd like to go on, but I'm gonna throw up       All told, the Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking is not for casual fans and I seriously considered giving it just 2 stars.  I gave it 3 because I'm one of the few that gave this chance after chance after chance until I grew to like it a fair amount, but it's still nowhere near the best effort musically from Roger Waters and is in fact possibly his worst.      For fans of Pink Floyd looking to explore Waters as a solo artist, I would recommend 1992's \\"Amused To Death\\" or 1987's \\"Radio KAOS\\" before this as both are nearly twice as good.  Both of those have better defined concepts and are more interesting and varied musically.  Amused To Death in particular is a strong effort on par with the best work he did with Pink Floyd.  Waters considers it one of his 3 masterworks along with Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, and I'm inclined to agree.

Would highly recommend Amazon for a professional service and satisfaction guaranteed. The album is Shirley had her best.
038073186X|4.0|This is the second Lehane I have read, following Mystic River (before the movie came out), and I wasn't at all disappointed.  The theme of this book is very different from Mystic River in that it is less realistic, but I found myself buzzing right through it.  I was always looking to figure out the next turn.  I am a person who bores with books very easily (I can't even count the number of books I have read half of), but this book really kept my attention and interest.  The end, when everything is pulled together, is pretty brilliant as well.  Looking forward to Scorcese's movie.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|I love this album, the are an amazing group,the music is phenomenal, great hooks.I saw them live at the house of Blues in Hollywood and have been looking for there album ever since I was not disappointed.
0060558121|3.0|This book started off good and ended good.  The middle was pretty terrible.  It went off into trying to develop Shadow instead of the plot.  Shadow is the dullest main character I've seen in a long while, so reading through his 'development' was something like pulling teeth.<br /><br />Also, chapter endings introduced characters that were not used again in any meaningful way.  These chapter caps felt both disconnected and wasteful.<br /><br />If only Gaiman had focused primarily on the unfolding plot, then this book would have been great all the way through.  As it is, only about 2/3 are great and remaining 1/3 is gray and pointless.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|There was a danger that this would just be a shaky and rather resentful attempt at tying up loose ends: not at all! This movie shows how much mileage there is left in the Stargate story - and, I am afraid to say, the lack of vision that lead to the series being dropped.
006135323X|5.0|This is by far my favorite book hands down. There are some bad reviews on here saying that Ariely's experiments are inaccurate, but regardless, it was still very entertaining to read. I definitely recommend this book!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|This is by far one of the best artists waiting a long time to come. Her voice brings out the raw emotion in her song. She can pull highs and lows but the country tune gives it a very home feel. It makes you feel connected to the song. Yet the pace is fast enough to keep you engrossed all the way. \\"Turpentine\\" can be a very good example of how she pulls of this amazing feat of vocals which is hard to describe. Best you hear it for yourself. Other songs are more upbeat like \\"Have you ever?\\" makes you go back to the days when you are a kid. Just close your eyes turn up the volume and ignore the world as brandi guides you through hers.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Man...    These guys keep making weaker and weaker music.    This new album sounds like an uplifting Christian rock compilation.    I hereby declare Coldplay the new Air Supply.    Weak, boring, and not as catchy as previous efforts.    But your mom might like it.
B000QXDED6|3.0|\\"300\\" is a testosterone-drenched and fanciful account of Sparta's heroic albeit doomed stand at Thermopylae against the Persian hordes.  You have here enough violence for three Sam Peckinpah movies, with buckets full of blood left over.      It's interesting that apparently the Greek warriors must have studied at Harrow or Sandhurst, as they all speak with veddy British accents.    As to how Xerxes and his minions are portrayed, let's just say you could have titled it, \\"Queer Eye for the Persian Guy.\\"    Not for the squeamish!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|It takes a little time, but wow. I give the band credit for changing their sound when they could have done the same thing over and over again.
1595141715|5.0|Wow.  What a great book.  Sad, but I didn't cry.  It was more like the kind of sad where you can't cry.  The kind of sad where you're partially in shock, like you just can't believe it even while you can.    Clay comes home from school one day to find a mysterious package waiting on the porch for him.  He opens it, and inside are seven audiotapes, each side numbered.  He places Cassette 1: Side A into the tape player and hears a voice he never thought to hear again: that of Hannah Baker, his classmate and crush, who committed suicide two weeks before.  Hannah has thirteen reasons-thirteen people who affected her-why she killed herself.  The tapes are making the rounds, heading to those people.  Clay is one of them, and if he listens to the tapes, he'll learn why.    There's like nothing to say about this book other than that you should read it.  I didn't want to stop reading it.  I loved the way that it went back and forth between Hannah and Clay: Hannah tell her story, Clay telling his and adding his comments to Hannah's story.  I loved how this book was more about the characters, more like short stories that were all connected.  There was really no plot.  It's about Hannah's struggle with herself and the people around her, but we already know that she kills herself.  Now we just have to find out why.     This is definitely one of those books that affects you, the reader.  It really changes your perspective about people and yourself.  It really shows how even the smallest action, one that seems harmless, can be driving someone else to consider killing themselves.  It's about learning to live with yourself, learning to live with your mistakes, seeing that you could have made a different choice but choose not to.  And that there may not be any going back.  You just have to face it.

0375836675|4.0|Ed Kennedy is only nineteen years old, but already he feels his life is going nowhere. He drives a cab, shares a run-down apartment with his coffee-drinking dog, the Doorman, and his social life consists of playing cards with friends who are on the same track he is. He's also in love with his best friend, Audrey, but he can't tell her, so he watches as she dates other men who are bad for her.    Then Ed happens to foil a bank robbery, and someone takes notice. His life begins to change when the ace of diamonds arrives in his mailbox along with a cryptic message. As Ed work his ways through a series of cards and tasks that continue to arrive on his doorstep, he's taken deeper into the mystery of who is sending the cards and why. Zusak's straight-forward storytelling takes the reader right into the gritty realities of Ed's life and the lives of the people he comes into contact with through the playing cards. Along the way he ponders not just what he wants to do with his life, but more importantly, what kind of person he wants to be.    This wholly original book will fascinate you to the end.
B0017ZB8M6|3.0|I was pleasantly surprized when i first listened to this cd.  There is only one song that i didn't love.  All the rest are-sing at the top of your lungs while driving-hot!  I like her honest lyrics and 80's style beats.  I normally don't listen to this kind of pop music but i am thrilled with my purchase on this one!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is a very strong cd by a group that is one of a kind.  I first heard of this cd when I was stationed in California and have been listening to it ever since.  In my opinion this cd expressed deep emotions and creativity that are in each of the members of the group in a very artistic and exciting way.  Some of the songs that I really feel are fun and grow each listen are \\"somewhere I belong\\", \\"breaking the habit\\", \\"easier to run\\",  and \\"lying from you\\".  One of my coworkers who happens to be an exciting and interesting person gave me a copy of this cd that they downloaded and I am sure grateful they did.  This is definitely an album that is worth your time and will grow on you each listen.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I guess this is one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" movies, so all I<br />can do is tell you why I love it so much. First, filming the<br />movie in Japan was not only a way to capture the two main<br />characters out of their element (which was the brilliant, central<br />point of the film), but it took ME out of MY element, which was<br />refreshing. I loved the nightlife, the colorful characters, the<br />strange looking food, the cherry blossoms in the gardens...<br />the setting for the film was magnificent.<br /><br />As for the two main leads, the acting is superb. Bill Murray<br />takes a huge leap playing an aging, burned out actor with marital<br />woes and hits the mark, dead on. Scarlett Johansson approaches<br />the youthful object of  his affection with understated sweetness<br />and grace. Neither  actor overplays or underplays their part, which<br />is rare in film. Both are spot on.<br /><br />And for the story. How refreshing to explore the complexity of<br />male/female bonding without resorting to raunchy sex scenes<br />and offensive language. Maybe the reason why so many<br />viewers are disappointed in this film is because of its quiet,<br />thoughtful, deeply tender approach to the subject matter. There's<br />no fast cars or nudity in this film; just the story of two lost souls<br />completely out of their element who find each other and reawaken<br />in each other something both of them thought they had lost.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, as the Jesus and Mary Chain song plays and<br />the two part ways, I always get teary-eyed. If someone can tell me<br />what the two whisper to each other, I'd really like to know. But then<br />again, maybe that would be giving too much away in this brilliant gem<br />of a film. Highly recommended for those in search of a lighthearted<br />and tender romance that doesn't follow traditional rules of \\"love\\"<br />constructions in cinema. Brava Sophia!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Worth the wait, a product that truly met its hype.  Tastefully refined talent, this album is bound to be iconic to its decade.  Kudos to Coldplay for bringing the art to yet new levels.
B0012Q732O|5.0|10,000 BC wasn't all that bad. All right, yes it was, but I managed to sit through the whole thing, which is more than I can say for a lot of movies these days. It was entertaining in a mindless, drooling sort of way and the effects were good enough to keep me borderline conscious from start to finish. The geography in this thing was seriously confused, to say the least. The main characters, apparently northern European mammoth hunters, cross a mountain range which appears to be the Alps, emerging in sub-Saharan Africa, at which point they head back across the desert to find themselves in Egypt, where woolly mammoths are being used to build the pyramids. Now, I'm too lazy to actually look this up, but I was under the impression that there were no mammoths in Ancient Egypt and everybody knows that shape-shifting reptilian aliens actually built the pyramids, not that it really matters. I don't want to give away the plot, so I'll just say that it's basically the same as Apocalypto, a truly great movie, proving once again that no concept is immune to recycling by midgets. The grand finale of 10,000 BC is almost as stupid as the ending of the TV version of The Stand, one of the dumbest scenes ever filmed, but the body count was high enough to keep me amused for a couple of hours, so I'll give it a five stars. What the hey.  Is it worth watching? Hell, no, but if you're determined to stare blankly at something, dribbling all over yourself, it might as well be this.    Ancient World Review
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I caught the HBO HD versions of all three movies.  I'm assuming that the HD versions are the exact same as the upcoming releases (if not better).<br /><br />The HD versions were very nice.  The first two movies were grainy in some parts, for instance, during Michael's trial before the commission.<br /><br />I think it is too difficult to perfectly transfer 35mm film to a digital format.  I think they did a tremendous job with the HBO HD versions and I hope the Blu Ray ones will be better visually.  I already know the sound tranfers will be great.<br /><br />I can hear the opening trumpet now in TrueHD.
1569242739|5.0|From the organizer of the first and second annual Santa Barbara vegan bake off:     I like to try lots of different baking books--vegan and non-vegan alike.    I was sitting down tonight with my King Arthur Baker's Companion (amazing but each recipe has at least a stick of butter in it) and even leafed through How it All Vegan (their choc chip recipe is pretty good) before I remembered I had picked up this little book.  The book is well written and fun to look through.  Perfect for those nights when you just want to make something fun after dinner without having to prepare with a ton of ingredients in advance.    I chose a red velvet cupcake recipe and a vegan cream cheese frosting.      What can I say, my boyfriend has already eaten half the batch so I must say it was a success!
B0015FHDRW|5.0|Green Day Rules !!! This just goes to show the talent these guys have to go from punk rock to garage rock and make it look so easy.  By the way AWESOME show in New Orleans.  I was front row and never saw a better show than that one.  You guys RULE!!!!
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|Dearest Coldplay,   Now that you've realized you are not radiohead, why are you so desperately trying to be U2 now?? Awww, come on!!!  Let's pretend you didn't steal the artwork, you didn't steal that song from that unknown band and you didn't like that emo band image (chemical romance)...Still, where are the great love songs, Chris?   Gwyneth's giving too much attention to the kids?
B000W0A97C|2.0|I was hoping for something new from Joni Mitchell.  \\"Shine\\" is, unfortunately, just more of Joni Mitchell's perpetually down tone point of view -- amplified with her amazing and remarkable musical and creative talents.  I had hoped she had matured to a better and more positive place and would be less indulgent of her own unique style of finding no magic in anything.  We KNOW Joni Mitchell COULD create something aesthetically and spiritually pleasing, because she's done it before.  But she did not this time.
B0000085N4|4.0|With this album, The Cult completed their transformation to a rock band. There are many strong songs on this album - Sun King, Sweet Soul Sister, Soul Asylum, Fire Woman. However, my feeling is the second half just drags. I have a certain degree of nostalgia for this given when it came out, I just don't think it had the same degree of complexity or interest as 'Love'. Having said that, you could do much worse than buy this album, which is arguably the Cult's second best.
B0006GAOBI|2.0|Someone on this board headlines their review:  \\"Remarkably original.\\"  Well, hardly.  Listening to the director's commentary, he credits a Twilight Zone episode as perhaps having inspired him.  The episode mentioned is \\"Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.\\"  While there is something to this comparison, the episode that \\"Donnie Darko\\" is virtually a twisted rip-off of is is a rather obscure episode written by Earl Hamner of \\"The Waltons\\" fame.  The episode is called \\"Ring-a-Ding Girl\\" and is, in essence, the entire story of \\"Donnie Darko\\" told under half-an-hour, in a much more touching manner.  And yes, there is even a jet crash in it and the ultimate sacrifice.  But - watch the TZ episode and see for yourself.  Just like \\"The Sixth Sense\\" was lifted from an old \\"Thriller\\" episode....alas, there is nothing new under the sun!
B000000OQY|5.0|This album has something for everyone (even racists, if you thing about \\"One in A Million\\"), but generally was partially opportunistic (releasing the EP - Live Like a Suicide) and another four acoustic tracks. How it would look to fans was very much parodied within the album cover which exploits the tabloid nature of their press at the time. The songs are all solid, even the acoustic version of \\"Your crazy\\" generally seems to work better than the electric version. 'Patience' is a fantastic song which, at the time really showed people some of the potential range and scope of the band. \\"Used to Love Her\\" is very tongue in cheek and reminds me of the feel of \\"No Expectations\\" by the Rolling Stones. Signalled the potential for the band which would be more fully explored in the (somewhat overblown but with many good songs) Use your Illusion albums.     The Live - Like A Suicide EP really reminds me of Aerosmith, Johnny Thunders and New York Dolls. If you like those bands you will probably recognise the influence here. Great tongue and cheek lyrics \\"I lead a reckless life, and yknow, its my only vice\\".
B000YABYLA|4.0|This is a great movie if you take it for what it is - a well made, fun to watch romantic comedy with very likeable characters.   As others have cautioned, though, teenage pregnancy is no way treated fairly in this movie. Such a story could have played out so nicely only in heaven. In real life, I can only imagine the nightmare that it is being pregnant at 16.
B0001I55SS|3.0|The premise for this movie is good. Even the characterisation is not bad, however, the plot seems to have large periods of meandering without purpose. Having built a fantastic set, created a wonderful villain, the crew of heroes are fairly bland and characterless. Also some of the dialogue could be tightened. Not as fun as some other films from the era (Battlestar Galactica, Flash Gordon) but with an interesting premise. Definitely recommended for fans of 2001 - a Space Odyssey, although it achieves nothing of the intensity of that movie.
0670827592|5.0|I don't know one child who doesn't love this book--a wonderful addition to your library.
0765342294|5.0|This is my favorite book! i read again in 2 days recently and i still picked up new things from it.  its a great read for people of all ages younger people will like the action while as you get older you can appreciate the fine lines of an ethical struggle between the sacrifice of one for the good of many, and who decides what the good is.  Hightly recommended!
038533348X|5.0|The 60's paranoia doesn't get more sharp, more funny and more smart than Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\". But, unfortunately, this portray is still somehow up to date than ever. Published early in that decade, this novel concerns on the fear of a chemical war and the end of the world. One of the characters is a scientist who fathered the Atomic Bomb and also developed something called `ice-nice' that is able to freeze all the water in the world. When the novel was published the world was living the edge of Cold War - hence the interesting metaphor. This is also a cautionary (and very funny) tale about too much power and too much desire of ending the workd. Vonnegut's tone transits between the regular science- fiction and black humor that add more layers to the book. If for one side the characters are plain, on the other, what remains, the fear of a nuclear war or something like it, is very relevant and contemporary.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First, let me start by saying  Iwas one of the people who saw the movie first, then went and got Firefly. This was a couple of years ago, but  I still love this show. It is honestly the best TV show I have ever watched. Now I would be lying if I said I didn't like sci-fi shows, but I am not a sci-fi junky, I don't even like Star Trek. I watch all sorts of shows, from comedy to suspense and everything in between.   Firefly takes elements from all of these genres and puts them together into an intersting, witty, funny, space-western....hybrid?    It is a sci-fi show, but it isn't only for the hard-core sci-fi people, I promise. I don't know where people on here get off comparing it to Star Wars or Star Trek. It isn't supposed to be like that. It is something new.     I highly recommend Firefly to anyone and everyone and I hope you will like it.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|The National-Boxer ****1/2<br /><br />Matt Berninger, Bryce Dessner, Aaron Dessner, Bryan and Scott Devendorf have been slowly perfecting their sound over their past few albums, and with Boxer, I truly feel The Nation have hit on what it is they were aiming to achieve. Complexity meets minimalistic vocals and instrumentation and lyrics to create a feel more than a sound, and an atmosphere may be a better term.<br /><br />Boxer is an album to get lost in, much like Miles Davis' [[ASIN:B000HBK1UQ Porgy and Bess]]. It is an album to free your mind and just let go with. The opening song 'Fake Empire' is one of the most magnificent gems ever recorded. Both socially conscious and touching. 'Mistaken For Strangers' is uniquely played. 'Squalor Victoria' aside from having, what could be the perfect title, is easily the albums focal point. 'Slow Show' brings the band into new territory, much different then all their previous work. 'Apartment Story' is without comparison.<br /><br />What may be most surprising is that the most impressive and attention grabbing thing about the album is the drumming. It's fresh, and original in a time of trite, and shopworn musicianship. It helps to push the entire album to that next level.<br /><br />The National's Boxer is among some of the best music heard since the turn of the century. Highly recommended.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|This Priest kind of goes along the lines of another visionary artist that consistently produces 2 disc sets of thematic prog, but heavy prog. He requests and receives the vocal assistance of some of the toughest vocalists in metal today- the man is Arjen Lucassen [[ASIN:B000YKOXEA 01011001 (Ltd. Edition)]]. This Priest is mature, letting down their guard perhaps to accept their place in history as a band that can produce at will of self determination, not mass appeal. I have not listened to Priest since Ram It Down, mostly because I just rode the prog wagon from then on only. It wasn't because I lost interest in Priest, just because I floated away from a lot of things after Ram It Down came out. So, back to the task at hand, Nostradamus came to my attention through the website of the album art designer Mark Wilkinson, who has done so many artists covers and album art; for such a diverse group of artists; from Priest to Marillion and Fish, that it is amazing and hypnotic. When I saw his work for Nostradamus well before the release of the album, I was charged to search it out. Having just gotten well and truly baptized by the latest Ayreon work, I was really excited when I heard bits of the tracks Visions and the title track on itunes. When the full album was released and I listened from beginning to end- I was not disappointed. I read a review by a critic who said there were some songs that could have been attributed to Spinal Tap, but that is not really constructive criticism now is it? And actually, according to Charles Caleb Colton,\\"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\\" That would indicate that Spinal Tap holds the genre of metal in high regard. And I have nothing but the highest praise for \\"Nostradamus\\".

Thanks Guys!! Talent like this is rare these days.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Let me begin by saying, I'm a huge fan of the first two movies in the series, specifically Alien. I loved the nail biting suspense of not knowing what the creature looked like or where it was, or even what it could do. Suspense... that was the first movie.<br /><br />Action... that is this movie. Almost from the beginning we have aliens and gunshots to keep us entertained and at the edge of our seat.<br /><br />Aliens takes place after Ellen Ripley (Weaver) returns to earth from the first movie. Plagued by nightmares and the loss of her child (an added scene to the DVD which gives a bit more depth to he character). Enter Paul Reiser as the token corporate schmuk who gets Ellen to return to the planet LV426 (where they answered the distress call in the first movie and picked up the Alien). Apparently there has been a colony of people living there setting up an atmosphere on the planet that are suddenly not responding.<br /><br />Somewhere in all of this There is added in footage of the terraformers (settlers) which explains how the aliens got to the colony in the first place. This scene also gives more background on Newt.<br /><br />So Ripley and a group of Marines (Bill Paxton, Michael Bienn, Lance Hendriksen and several others) set out to determine what happened to the missing colonists.<br /><br />Once they land on the planet the non-stop action begins. Instead of just one alien wreaking havoc on a ship, there are now legions of them crawling all over the settlement. It turns into a life and death game of war between the two species as the humans attempt to survive in this dangerous environment.<br /><br />One of the main differences between this film and the first one is that they have no problem showing the aliens to you. This takes some of the mystery out of them, however they are no less frightening. Also we are given a better understanding of how the aliens work in this movie, setting up for the third and fourth films in the series.<br /><br />Another difference is in the sheer action of this flick, this one is more about gun fire, grenades, flame throwers, and painful death scenes. Unlike many action movies however, the characters are interesting and we are saddened by their demise. Even Bishop (Lance Hendriksen) the android becomes a lovable character.<br /><br />There are 17 minutes of additional footage that have been added into the film since the theatrical release, I was able to find most of it, but I'm sure some is just added shots in the action sequences.<br /><br />The Special Features on the DVD include cut scenes, Trailers, a slide show and a Behind the Scenes. Honestly I was disappointed because the behind the scenes wasn't the one I expected it to be. At one time I saw on TV a behind the scenes special that was very interesting and informative, this seemed to be a chopped down and edited version of that.<br /><br />Incase you haven't seen the movie, the acting is believable, somewhat above what you would expect in an action adventure film. Some of the lines are a bit forced but nothing takes away from the viewer's enjoyment of the film. The script is interesting and easy to follow, I have to admit that the added in footage did help explain several of the questions I had in the original version of the movie.<br /><br />The special FX are awesome and totally believable except for one awful blue screen shot at the end. All of the creatures are realistic and frightening. The sets are dark, dismal, and add to the overall feel of the film. (My mom always asks why in the future everything has to be so ugly). The action scenes are fluid and exciting to watch. I have nothing negative to say about the movie.<br /><br />If you like the film buy the DVD to get the additional footage and to own a classic Action/Horror Flick. Don't buy it just for the DVD extras because they aren't all that exciting.<br /><br />Recommended:<br />Yese is more about gun fire, grenades, flame throwers, and painful death scenes.

B00003CY5J|4.0|I watched \\"The Score\\" because it was one of Brando's last movies.  That was as good a reason as any although Brando was not much of a presence in the film.  The two main characters were De Niro and Norton.  These two played very well off each other and elevated the movie (along with a great plot and script).  There were ample twists and turns that drew me more and more into \\"The Score\\".  The ending was excellent and my time was well spent.  However, the movie had a fault or two.  The main one was the romantic aspect.  It really didn't fit the film.  This is a cerebral action movie with no time for examining a tenuous relationship.  Yes, we needed to understand De Niro as a man who was after one last score and with a vision of his future and the partner to share it with.  But why give us a partner who seemed so unworthy of that supporting role?  Oh well, to each his own.  I appreciated a good fast-paced movie that kept me thinking after all the complex dramas I've been watching lately.  I liked the Montreal setting too.

B0018AK9RA|2.0|What a disappointing cd. Out of a handful of signiture Priest sounding rockin songs, this cd is boring and uneventful!!       almost every song is ballad of sorts. The 2nd cd in the set is the worst of all. The only bright spot on the cd is Halfords vocals which are amazing and probably the best he's every done(ashame it's on a pitiful cd) and the guitar work is more classical styled and melodic.      Overall I am let down. I was expecting a True metal offering from the pioneers and what I got was ballad laden, boring and sad epic piece of crap!!
0385751532|4.0|Bruno is an innocent and sheltered nine-year-old boy from Berlin. His father is an officer in the German army during WWII. After \\"The Fury\\" comes to dinner, Bruno is told that \\"The Fury\\" has great things in store for his father and they suddenly move from their family home to a not-so-nice house in \\"Out-With.\\" From his new bedroom window, Bruno can see a high fence. The dirt area inside the fence is barren except for many low huts inhabited by a large number of people, all wearing striped pajamas.     Bruno, who dreams of becoming an explorer, follows the fence until he meets a thin, sad boy named Shmuel, who is sitting on the other side of the fence. The boys discover that they have the same birthday and decide that they are destined to be best friends.     Because the story is told through the eyes of an innocent and sheltered boy who does not understand what \\"Out-With\\" is really all about, the violence and brutality is more subdued than in other Holocaust stories I have read. This actually made the ending even more disturbing, as Bruno doesn't see it coming.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|When I heard who was in this production I will admit I was hesitant to go see it on the big screen.  I was therefore wonderfully surprised at the result.  The acting, the costumes, the set designs, and the singing are great.  This is the most true to the story production I have yet to sing and my favorite off all the versions I have seen and own.  Treat yourself, this is great. Cudo's for all involved.

Marley warns Scrooge that three ghosts will visit him and give him one last chance of redemption.     The three ghosts of Christmas (Past, Present, and Yet to Come) convince Scrooge to change his ways and to rediscover the kind and generous man he was as a young man.

0810993139|5.0|First book in the Wimpy Kid series.     Greg keeps a journal to record the events of his first year in middle school. He writes about getting put into teh gifted reading group, \\" I was pretty disappointed to find out I got put in the Gifted group, because that just means a lot of extra work.\\"     Greg wonders about popularity and grades as he tries to figure out who he wants to be. His family doesn't help--his older brother is a creep and his younger brother tattles constantly. His parents, well, they are simply clueless. his best friend, Rowley, is not the sharpest crayon in the box and Greg is always trying, and failing, to explain the complicated rituals of adolescence. For instance, \\"I have told Rowley at least a billion times that now that we're in middle school, you're supposed to say 'hang out,' not 'play.' But no matter how many noogies I give him, he always forgets the next time.     The book is written on lined paper, with lots of funny little drawings, so it really feels like reading someone's journal. Greg's voice is fresh and funny.

0425220931|5.0|As a music major and literature lover, the first section (and usually only) I visit at the book store is the music section. I was actually searching for another book that was no where to be found, and decided to just browse around. I accidentally stubled upon this book that had only two copies of itself. It seemed intruguing, and then upon seeing its author I definatly had to give it a chance. While leaving the store, I was hoping my money was well spent.    The character Mr. Wooten learns from in this book would most likely call my stumble upon it a sure act of fate. I was meant to pick up this book and it has now given me a new, liberating outlook on my music and developed love for the art better than anything I had ever experienced. Any musician or music appreciator can read this book and change their ability and enjoyment for music perminantly. I have even created a method of incorporating the book with my practice routine. No, I have actually created a new routine based on this book-It is THAT life changing.     Your life and your music are a unity, the same entity, and should be treated as so. This book will teach you to do this naturally, as if you were born with this knowlege. You will connect with Music in the perfect way for the rest of your life, and if you care about her, you will read this book!

B000VWE5OY|5.0|This Doctor Who spin-off is just as ingenious as the latest incarnations of Doctor Who.  Torchwood gives us characters with depth and humanity, that battle against the odds on an almost daily basis, while being quite obviously vulnerable and fallible, as we also often see the elements of their personal lives play out amidst the \\"challenges\\" posed by the many and varied alien threats.  Torchwood is also not without its commentaries on our society today, in that sometimes the \\"threat\\" is not alien, but humans that are so twisted and evil that they are in actuality quite in-human (and thus filling the role expected of \\"hostile aliens\\").  Yes, we cannot help but reminisce about certain episodes of the X-Files, if we are also familiar with that series.      Russell T. Davies, who also brought us the latest incarnation of Doctor Who, has done an awesome job of bringing us a darker trek into the sci-fi genre, making excellent use of his talent for creative plots, character development, great special effects (on a budget), and much more!  He also provides us with a perspective that can be quite thought-provoking, as we consider the world of today (here on Earth), and the possibilities that the future may hold for human-kind.  If there is intelligent life \\"out there\\", will we really be ready for our contacts with it, when it finally does happen???  How much of the world's population today, is actually ready to live respectfully, harmoniously, and appropriately with their own \\"neighbors\\" on this tiny little planet that we all call home -- even when our neighbors might seem rather \\"alien\\" to us?  And, of course, we do LOVE Captain Jack!
1423101464|5.0|Fourth book in the Percy Jackson series.     Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson set out to find the inventor Daedalus in the mysterious labyrinth that seems to have a life of its own. Their task is to find Daedalus and talk him out of helping Kronos. Grover is also given one last chance to find Pan before his searcher's license is revoked.     Many of the elements I loved in the first book are back in this one: the humor, the mythological references, and the edge-of-your-seat excitement as Percy goes from one dangerous situation to another. The ending is very much a cliffhanger and I am looking forward to reading the last book.

0385720920|4.0|Bizarre isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.     Victor Mancini is medical school dropout and a sex addict. He raises money to pay for his crazy mother's care in a nursing home by pretending to choke in restaurants. The people who \\"save\\" him feel like heroes and also feel responsible for him.     This book is for MATURE readers who are not easily offended. It is extremely sexually explicit--perverted, dark, and oddly fascinating.
B000002OX7|5.0|After the enormous success of the band's previous album \\"Tommy\\" it was going to be very difficult for The Who to top it.  Pete Townshend started off writing another concept piece called The Lighthouse Project.  The recording sessions went on and on with the project eventually suffocating under its own weight.  The band gave up on it, and went back into the studio to pick up the pieces.  What emerged was the ultimate Who statement and probably one of the ultimate statements of rock n roll.  \\"Who's Next\\" is about as close to a perfect album as you could get.  Starting with the fist pumping anthem \\"Baba O'riley\\" and closing with what is in my opinion one of the greatest and most important songs of all time \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".  \\"Meet the new boss.....same as the old boss\\", indeed.  Words that are as relevant today as when they were written 30 plus years ago.  Roger Daltry's famous scream near the end still sends shivers up my spine.  In between these two tracks are 6 more great songs, \\"Bargain\\", \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\", John Entwistle's \\"My Wife\\", \\"The Song Is Over\\" which featured the main theme from the abandoned Lifehouse Project, \\"Getting In Tune\\", and \\"Going Mobile\\".  All just classic stuff.  This is The Who at the top of their game and solidified their place as one of the greatest rock bands of all time.  As great as this album is, in my opinion they topped it with the next one \\"Quadrophenia\\".

B0018AK9RA|5.0|Judas Priest's 14th studio album with lead preacher (I mean singer) Rob Halford entitled Nostradamus was released in June of 2008.<br />After scoring big time with their superb comeback album, 2005's masterpiece Angel of Retribution, Judas Priest (which again was lead singer Rob Halford, guitarists Glenn Tipton and KK Downing (this is his swan song with the band), bass player Ian Hill and drummer Scott Travis) decided to do something different with its followup. The band decided to record a concept album. Not just any run of the mill concept album but a double concept album (think of classics like The Who's Quadrophenia, Yes' Tales From Topographic Oceans, Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and Pink Floyd's The Wall) at a time when albums (let alone concept albums) were seen as old hat in the day and age of the single song download ala the McDonald's fast food dinner.<br />The album sees the band try new things (like real orchestras) and resurrect some older tricks (guitar synthesizers, keyboards) and write an album about the most famous prophet Nostradamus (only Al Stewart dared to write a song about the famed prophet over 35 years before Priest recorded their album). The results are one of the band's finest albums (in my Top 10 Favorite Priest Studio Albums List) as I found out on the day it came out (but became a masterpiece IMHO years on).<br />The opening &#34;Dawn of Creation&#34; is a superb overture (think &#34;I Am the Sea&#34; on Quadrophenia) before segueing into &#34;Prophecy&#34; which is a stellar track. Next is the interlude &#34;Awakening&#34; which gives was into the 7 minute &#34;Revelations&#34; which is a superb up-tempo rocker and a stellar classical guitar solo before going into superb leads by Tipton and Downing. &#34;The Four Horsemen&#34; is another interlude which goes into another great song out of &#34;War&#34;. &#34;Sand of Time&#34; is yet another stellar interlude which then goes into the rocker &#34;Pestilence and Plague&#34;. &#34;Death&#34; is next and the second 7 plus minute epic on the first disc. &#34;Peace&#34; is another stellar interlude which then gives way into another rocker &#34;Conquest&#34;. We then slow things down with &#34;Lost Love&#34;. The first disc ends with &#34;Persecution&#34; which has a unique intro with keyboards, vocoders, guitars before speeding into a full throttled rocker.<br />We begin the second disc with the piano and synth interlude &#34;Solitude&#34; which gives way to the mid tempoed melodic piece &#34;Exiled&#34;. &#34;Alone&#34; is next and the first of two near eight minute epics on the second disc starts with acoustic guitars before getting heavy into a tempo ala &#34;Beyond the Realms of Death&#34; and Rob Halford's shrieks on the chorus just are mindblowing. &#34;Shadows in the Flame&#34; is next and another stellar interlude with acoustic guitars and a relaxed Halford vocal before going into &#34;Visions&#34; which is a stellar number. &#34;Hope&#34; is next and is a nice interlude which then goes into &#34;New Beginnings&#34; which is a slower song with acoustic guitars for the bulk of the tune before the electric guitars come in for the solo but a great song. &#34;Calm Before the Storm&#34; is the final interlude for the album (and a fitting interlude) before it goes into full throttle metal on the title cut complete with double bass drumming, lightning guitars and screaming vocals. We close with the eight and a half minute epic &#34;Future of Mankind&#34; which is a great mid-tempo rocker which closes this brilliant album in style.<br />Nostradamus would become Judas Priest's highest charting album in the States when it debuted at #11 as the fans were willing to give it a chance (like myself and now listening to it in 2013, I enjoy it more now than I did in 2008 (which I did but didn't overplay it)). This album proves that Priest (like Iron Maiden) can change their sound and get away (if they did albums ala AC/DC and did Painkiller 2, Screaming For Vengeance 2, British Steel 2 they would have become boring).ng For Vengeance 2, British Steel 2 they would have become boring).
0743277708|5.0|A group of rabbits searches for a new home after Fiver, a rabbit with \\"The Sight\\" has a vision of their current home being destroyed by a land developer.     After the rabbits find a new warren on Watership Down, they realize that they have no females. They look for some females to join their group, but meet only a terrible warren called Efrafa run by the controlling General Woundwort.     Though the characters are all rabbits, the story is all about human nature. I especially loved the rabbit culture and mythology that is so simply yet beautifully expressed in the stories they tell.     An amazing read for all ages!
B00139W3NE|1.0|This movie is real dull, without much of a plot or story.  The worst thing of all is that THERE IS NO CONCLUSION.  A real ripoff.  I guess they expect us to wait with baited breath for a sequel to finish the story?  There were also some good actors totally wasted in this drivel, like Christopher Lee and Derek Jacoby.  I also wasn't expecting this to be children's movie, but that is what it is.  Oh, by the way, they ripoff Chronicles of Narnia.  They wish they were 1/100th as good as Narnia.  Even the voice of the ice bear was a ripoff of the talking lion of Narnia.
0375423877|5.0|First book in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.     Precious Ramotswe, in the face of many doubts, starts a detective agency after the death of her father. Her response to these skeptics is, \\"Haven't you ever heard of Agatha Christie?\\"     However, the true beauty of this book is not the mystery (though her cases are solved in satisfying ways). What I found most engaging is the glimpse into the culture of Botswana. Precious is a delightful character whose wisdom and humor will keep readers entranced throughout this quiet little book.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I haven't purchased a Madonna album in years.  Her recent ones just didn't interest me enough.  This one is a different story.  I think it's because most of the tracks are upbeat.  I love it.

Newly engaged Precious Ramotswe continues to solve local mysteries as she negotiates her relationship with master mechanic Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Watching them decide where to live, the matter of the engagement ring, and the surprise arrival of two foster children is gently humorous and true to life.     Absolutely wonderful. I especially recommend the audio version.
6304698623|5.0|Honestly, people need to get over themselves! I'm sorry everything can't be like the book, but it's hollywood for godsakes!! If every movie was like the book it originated from, the movie would be 6 hours long. Get real!  Anyways, I DID read the book, and while the movie did differ, i still enjoyed it. It was a great family film and to the people who have not seen it, ignore the rants about how horrible it was because those people writing that are just pissy the movie was different from the book!
6305313687|5.0|Gripping!  Edward Norton and Edward Furlong are incredible actors. The movie is an eye opener about hatred, intolerance, and environmental effects on our behavior.  The events in the story could be true to life makes it scary.  Compelling story.
0316067601|5.0|What an amazing story. An absolute must-read for anyone interested in hearing first-hand account of soldiers and their experiences in afghanistan. I think it is an important reminder of the heroism and dedication of these soldiers.    Liberals who read this book are going to take issue with the author's stance on the media, ROE, and God. I'll just tell you that upfront. If you are not opposed to hearing the authors opinion on these subjects, then I think you may even end up liking the book.    He is so passionate and opinionated on these subjects that I think it may detract from the ability of the book to raise questions about how we are handling this war and the enemies we fight.    I find that this book - the SEALs experience, the moral dilemma they faced in the battlefield, and the consequences of their decision an important read for everyone - whether you agree with his politics or not.    I'm going to give away a bit of the story now, so if you don't want anything ruined, I suggest you stop reading right now.     There comes a turning point in their mission when they encounter three unarmed goat herders. They have a decision to make. Do they kill them right then and there and face the consequences at home, or do they let them go and risk the herders telling the Taliban about their presence, their numbers and location?     Some reviewers try to wriggle their way out of making this decision by bringing out other possibilities - possibilities which were not there. They couldn't take the goat herders prisoner or take them with them. It was broad daylight - the Taliban could be anywhere, watching them at anytime. They couldn't risk it. They did try to call HQ and ask what they should do - but got no reply. They couldn't just get airlifted out of there ASAP because there is no place for the helicopter to land in the immediate vicinity. The journey to a safe location was miles away. A journey they couldn't make in the broad daylight because of the lack of cover and the fear of being spotted by the Taliban.    Anyway, so back to the dilemma. Do they kill the goat herders, a violation of the Rules of Engagement which state that you cannot kill unarmed civilians or even unarmed combatants.  Or, do they let them go, risking their mission and their lives. Their first instinct is to kill them, in fact, deep down, they know thats what they should do. However, because they were afraid of being labeled and tried as murderers back home, they made the decision to let them go. And that decision cost them their lives.    I think this is where we need to stop and think. Do we think they made the right decision? Were the lives of the goat herders worth more than the three Navy SEALS (I'm going to leave out the soldiers that were killed in the helicopter crash because I feel that their deaths were not necessarily a direct consequence of the decision to let the goat herders free)?     I'm not saying that we should give the soldiers free reign to murder, rape, and pillage. Definitely not. But, when soldiers encounter grey areas such as these SEALs encountered, should we stand up for them when they opt for their own safety over following the ROE? Or, should we follow the ROE at any cost? Obviously Lutrell has his own opinions on the subject. He is a soldier, and he saw many of his best friends killed as a result of ROE.    I think this book does bring up some important points of debate and I wish people whose politics differed from the authors would be more open minded and rather than becoming defensive or put off, they would try to understand where the author was coming from rather than immediately writing him off as brainwashed, dumb, or arrogant.
B0001FR3PE|4.0|When a woman and her friends casually make a list of the attributes of the perfect man they never believed the list would get out into the public and cause such a stir. Unfortunately, it stirs up a maniac and their lives are in danger. This is the first book I've read by Linda Howard and I really enjoyed it. There is a lot of suspense, passion and humor that made me fall in love with the writer. It's hard to put the book down because it holds your interest from beginning to end. The way the killer is revealed is exciting! I want to read it again!
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I've had this album for about a year, and I can tell you it really is one of my favorites!  The blending of musical styles and instruments, not to mention the musical expertise of all the accompaniament is quite unique!  Like many others, I am particularly fond of the Middle Eastern influence in such pieces as 'Caravanserai.'  To me, pieces like this are written in 'camel time,'which is the cadence of camels crossing the endless desert, going somewhere, but a long, long way to go.... Excellent music for driving long distances, background music, music for contemplation and many other things as well, it is at once mesmerising, soothing and illuminating as well.  While it has taken Loreena ten years to come out with something new, when you consider the work and expertise by all parties that has gone into this, it really doesn't surprise me at all; perfection takes a long time to master!  I styrongly recommend this one, and if you like it (and I am pretty sure you will!) then try the new 'Night at the Alhambra' as well......
1569242739|5.0|I am not a vegan, and am not easily excited about vegan baked goods.  However I do have a best friend who is a committed vegan and who very much is excited by vegan baked goods.  When I purchased this book for her as a birthday gift, she was beyond thrilled.  I guess she had another vegan cookbook by this same author, and had already fallen in love with her recipes.  (Who knew?)    She later made  chocolate-strawberry-something cupcakes from this book, and when I tasted them, they really weren't half bad.  If you didn't really think about it, you almost couldn't tell that they were vegan.  If all vegan baked goods tasted like these cupcakes, maybe vegan cupcakes really could take over the world.  As she told me, \\"This book is as good as it gets!\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is great.  I'm not really sure why this was so poorly marketed, but the concept is fun, and the story is also a lot of fun.  The acting is very believable.  I found myself wishing that they had made more of this series.

0060826487|5.0|C. S. Lewis gave us a timeless adventure that never grows old.  I have the book, read it many times, but wanted it in audio, to listen as I crochet. The story is fresh each time I read or listen.  This is great to take on a trip, to listen while in the car.  You are never too old to hear it again and again.  Michael York is fantastic as the reader for the audio.  He really brings the story to life in a very real way.
B0002STNQ2|3.0|Prey is set mainly in the Nevada desert. At a research lab, an experiment with limited intelligence, nano technology, has gone wrong. Some of the nano particles have escaped into the atmosphere, and are starting to learn, adapt and multiply outside of the laboratory environment. As they become more intelligent, they start to become a threat to the scientists<br />inside their facility.<br /><br />I found this book slow moving at first. We are introduced to the main character, Jack Forman, an unemployed IT expert, and his family. His wife works at the research lab, in the desert, but the first part of the book deals mainly with Jack, and the increasingly strange behaviour of his wife. I suppose this is good from the character building point of view.<br /><br />Once, he visits the research lab, however, the book starts to get going, and the suspense starts to build, as they realise the enormity of the problem that they have on their hands, and the novel becomes a race against time, to destroy the nano particles. Overall, a fairly good read, with a few twists, reasonably good characterisation, but, also, very 'technical' in places.
055358894X|2.0|This book had so much potential. It has an interesting culture, it has a few characters that could glow, and a plot  that could go places with volition. It does none of those things.    There are flashbacks galore, interludes a plenty, and language that is gaudy. There are no cases in this story where a character uses a small word where a large one, or several large ones can be used instead. Worse, it feels as if the author has tried to shove an extra-superduper-extraordinary line of description every eight or twelve pages. The language clunks. It tries to be lyrical, it tries so hard and it fails. On top of this _all_ the characters have the same fulsome vocabulary, which seems a bit off. Sure, the group the title character is a part of is explained well, and the nobles are too, but the rest of the thieves, cut throats and petty criminals?     This book is what I imagine it would be like to watch The Nutcracker be performed in plate armor and clogs.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|This movie was great in its own context. It started out with, what I'll admit, were some slightly cheesy computer imagery of a desolate downtown NYC with Will Smith chasing a herd of deer through the abandoned streets. The CGI hemocytes (vampire people), were well done, but I'll agree with a few other reviewers that they could have been done differently and it would have had a greater effect. (without spoiling anything) Robert Neville is a colonel in the army who was charged with extinguishing the great viral outbreak that destroyed Earth's population. He decides to stay at what he calls \\"ground zero\\", b/c he truly believes that he can \\"fix this\\". In its own context, this is a very good movie, and definitely worth watching.
B00000IQW3|3.0|Growing up in the 80s my dad had a copy of this movie on vhs, and my brother and I watched this movie all the time.  The plot was straight out of every boys dreams, flying a space ship against an entire army of bad guys.<br /><br />The movie was awesome, at feeding my hunger to one day fly a space ship.<br /><br />So when I saw the movie available on DVD I had to grab it, and all the old memories came back in a moment.  But to my surprise it wasn't as good as I remembered it being.  The story that I cherished as a child, seemed over played and unbelievable even by sci-fi standards.<br /><br />The acting in it is pretty good, I've seen better, but you can't expect much more than what I saw in a movie like this.  The one shining spot in the movie for me was Robert Preston, You know the guy who was the Music Man, He was great in the movie and played the part to perfection.  I read somewhere that this was the last movie he acted in before his death.<br /><br />The Computer graphics on the movie wouldn't hold up against even the video game systems from 5 years ago, but to see them in the context of the time in which they were created it is pretty remarkable.<br /><br />For me the move is a solid 2 stars, meaning it is somewhere between fair and good, your kids will like it, but for the older viewer you should find something a little better.<br /><br />I gave the movie the extra third star for nostaglia reasons only.  I am a sucker for the movies of my youth no matter how bad they are.
B000YENUI6|3.0|You've seen the description of this movie, so I'll skip that. It's dark, violent, slow-moving at times, and very predictable until the end of the movie where you're rewarding with a slight twist in the story. Gritty, gruesome, and ALOT of Russian language lessons. If you like mobster movies, this one might be for you. If not, pass...

B0011ZNAIC|3.0|The first half of this movie is great. It was clever, funny, and original. The second half, while there were shining moments, fell short. Seinfeld was great, and his humor found its way through. Nearly all of the activity inside \\"the hive\\" was very entertaining. The problem with these types of movies is that it is becoming so easy to make them quickly. Movies like Toy Story and Monster's Inc. took years to make, which also gave them plenty of time to tweak and change the plot and script to make sure that it was perfect. Now that they take less time, and money, to make you end up with movies like this one (along with Madagascar, over the hedge, etc.) Yes, they are funny. However, in the end they don't quite measure up.
0385340567|5.0|In this latest Jack Reacher thriller, the ex-military loner finds himself caught between Hope and Despair. Colorado, that is. Two rural towns named by pioneers for an optical illusion that makes the Rockies appear near from Hope and far from Despair.<br /><br />Hitchhiking west from Hope, on his meandering way to San Diego, Reacher encounters no traffic heading to Despair and walks the whole 17 miles. Only to be clapped into jail as a vagrant after refusing to leave town and smacking down a couple of menacing deputies. Despair is not a hospitable place.<br /><br />But Jack Reacher is not a biddable man. And now he's curious.<br /><br />Planning his next trip with a bit more care and the help of Hope's attractive young deputy, Vaughan, Reacher slips through the desert at night, circling the huge scrap recycling plant that gives the company town its reason for being. Not only is the place vast, it's enclosed with state-of-the-art unscalable walls and down the road is a ship-shape military police post.<br /><br />But it's on his stealthy way back through the desert that he stumbles - literally - over the emaciated corpse of a young man, ratcheting up the stakes. Teaming up with Hope's deputy, who has issues of her own, Reacher ferrets out Despair's secrets - missing young men, the plant owner's nightly flights, over-the-top security, strange illnesses - with a mixture of mayhem, slick thinking, and stealth.<br /><br />Non-stop action, dark, dry humor and a slightly prickly romance keep the pages turning. Child's prose is fast, fluid and crisp and the plot, while a bit outlandish, is no less believable for that.  Reacher, a military personality with a lot of rules for himself, amazing skills, no possessions and footloose habits, is terrific fun, as always.
0061122416|5.0|the alchemist is one of the best books i've ever read! it's simple yet has a very deep meaning.. it's also touching and inspiring. i keep thinking about this story over weeks & months after i read it. i discuss it with my friend hersanto (he wrote a review about this book, too) who happens to love this book as well.<br /><br />\\"when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.\\"
B0009ML238|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Glory to the Empire\\" I was blown away, what an amazing song. I orignally bought the album \\"Isolate\\" and loved it so i got this one and it's even better ( IMO ). Silence from the Angels, The Prophecy are simply awesome too. The whole album is great if you love Dream Theater, Fates Warning, Queensryche etc your going to love this.<br />A \\"MUST HAVE\\" for prog fans. Production is superb.

B00062IDCO|5.0|Star Trek Voyager, in my opinion, is the best Star Trek series. I fell in love with the show about a year ago, when I finally decided to explore the Star Trek phenomenon. I was checking all channels to see when Star Trek was coming on, and Voyager was the first one I saw. I set my Tivo, and that night, I couldn't beleive what I saw. By coincidence, Spike TV was beggining the cycle again that day, and I started with Caretaker. I watched every single episode since then. A few months later, Spike's three episodes per day schedule had reached season seven. I first knew that season seven was going to be good after \\"Imperfection,\\" which was the SECOND episode of the season. Actually, first if you don't count Unimatrix Zero Pt 2. That feeling of greatness returned the next day when I watched Drive. That episode told me, \\"This will be the greatest season so far.\\" I was right. Skipping ahead to Q2, Q's third and final appearance on Voyager. That was when the writing REALLY got good. Heck, they even made an episode ABOUT writing in Author, Author! Every episode past Human Error is a classic, definetly. Endgame is my favorite episode in ALL of Star Trek, not just Voyager. The brilliant writing, magnificent acting, and amazing special effects end my favorite Star Trek series with a bang!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This is a great CD, rich in content, variety and layers of sound.  It reminds me of the concept style albums of the late 1960's and 70's- not in style, but in a unifying conceptual intelligence.  Production values are very high with a beautiful quality to each instrument and vocal.  Not prissy or over done, but with a rich 'material' feel like satin and silk.    While distinctive and indiviual in sound, it is music to be immersed in and reflects a dramatic story like quality in something of the tradition of early Genesis (a weird association I know).  I am just loving it. You can't beat the mix of creative intelligence with outstanding musicianship and dramatic choice matched by artistically integrated production.  A work of art!
B000YAA68W|4.0|Forget your stereotypes of Iranians. `Persepolis' is an engagingly funny, sad, and poignant look at Merjane (Margie) (Chiara Mastrorianni) a girl who grows up in Tehran during the 1980's.  Despite our possible preconceptions, Merjane surprisingly sports addidas sneakers, eats French fries, and yearns to shave her legs.  The movie provides an absorbing history lesson, showing us the close up ramifications of people's lives behind the headlines, and tells a captivating story about a girl trying to belong and survive under dire circumstances.    Until all the world changing events, Merjane lets us know, \\"I led a peaceful, uneventful life as a child.\\"  Within the family, Merjan's uncle is kindly, yet communist.  He's probably seen enough dictatorships and knows of only one way out.  His ordeal is documented well enough.  The most supportive in the family is Merjane's grandmother (Daniell Darrieux), whose affection and wisdom go a long way.  Her parents (Catherine Deneuve and Simon Abkarian) are also good people who yearn for freedom, but know how to keep Merjane's best interests above their own.      During the time, we get a first person perspective on the Shah of Iran, his rise to power, the unrest that led to his exile, and his subsequent replacement by Ayatolla Kohmeni while Saddam Hussein rose to power in Iraq.  From the narrative and the played out scenes, we get the pedestrian view of how these events came into fruition and their implications in everyday lives.  Later, the Iran-Iraq War is particularly unsettling for her entire country.  For her safety, Merjan flees her country and settles into Austria where she develops not so close friendships with the \\"Out\\" group, seeking refuge in the punk rock/alternative scene.  With Merjane telling her story we get an intimate and often comic take on the angst of adolescence as well as what it's like to be a foreigner who's mostly misunderstood or ignored.  She returns to her own country and her family, but the changes have made her an alien in her own neighborhood.  Knowing the origin of this film, you can probably guess what happens next...    The animation is unique and interesting.  Reminded that this film garnered a nomination for Best Animated Movie Oscar*, the extras show the French artists creating the film one frame (or picture) at a time.  Done mostly in black and white, the backgrounds are stylish, but mostly stagnant with the characters remaining flowing for every scene.  Oddly, it is only during the transportation scenes (like when she's waiting at the airport) when we are given the full color treatment.  Inevitably, it must be that hope colors her consciousness every time there's a new transition in her life.  I have one objection:  I didn't like all the body fluids presented.  I thought they kept it real enough without having to show all of that.  Ironically, the blood made a difference.  We need it as evidence; it provides an unflinching detail of the ordeal(s) at hand and respects all the people involved.      Our funny bones are tickled several times as our colorful rebel resorts to splendid retorts to zealous extremists (\\"Girls who reveal themselves will burn in hell,\\" says one educator), and we are served some truly funny thoughts about her body changes during puberty and the fallout of dating.  'Persepolis' has many simple joys entailed upon its viewing:  A fascinating first-person history lesson, an absorbing story, and a splendid protagonist.    (Not since Art Spiegelman's groundbreaking 'Maus' have I seen a similar graphic novel treatment give this much of a wollop.)      *`Ratatouille' won the Oscar for Best Animated Film from 2007.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Not only is this the best movie I've seen, but it's also the best sci-fi movie and the best love story. Yes, you heard me. The best love story. This is by far Pixar's masterpiece. I don't want to say that they'll have a hard time topping this, but if anyone can, Pixar can. At first, I felt a bit funny seeing this. I've a single, adult male with no kids. And I went to see this film alone and blown away by it.     See it with kids. See it without kids. Just go see it.    I can see this movie being nominated for Best Picture not just Best Animated feature. It's that good
0440178002|5.0|I love this book.  I'm so mad that I have already read it, because I want to experience it again for the first time!  While I am not Japanese, I have heard it said from a number of Japanese sources that Clavell's writing allows you to nearly step inside the Japanese psyche that helped to form the society of today.    While it is a fictional account, the book is loosely based upon the factual journey of William \\"Miura Anjin\\" Adams.  The character Lord Torinaga is loosely based on Ieyasu Tokugawa.    Overall it is a tremendous read - I devoured the 1000+ pages of the book in under a week.  A fantastic story of adventure, intrigue, power, love, loss and hope.    If you like this book, you can go on to the other books in Clavell's Asian Epic.  In chronological order, it is:    Shogun  Tai-Pan  Gai-Jin  King Rat  Noble House    I have read Tai-Pan and Gai-Jin, with the former being as good as Shogun, and the latter not nearly as much.  I have not read the books that follow - King Rat and Noble House, though I do look forward to doing so.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|With all the talk I heard about this DVD, it seems that it might just be fans of Anikin Skywalker's just loving him being in another movie that I did not feel was as good as the hype being said about it.<br /><br />Jumper is about a boy who one day discovers he can warp/teleport. He decides to use this power to take money from a few bank vaults and live a life of luxury. However his plan backfires when he finds out that he is not the only person who can do this trick. They are called Jumpers, and can warp to wherever they want to. He could be in New York city one minute and then warp straight to the Sphinx in Egypt.<br /><br />While discovering he is not alone, he also finds out there are (some name for it) a group of people who want to kill them for having this ability to jump wherever they want to. The plot pretty much goes around him trying to stay alive while protecting his girlfriend and learning to be a jumper.<br /><br />It sounds pretty cool when you hear the plot story, but I feel this movie could have been so much better then it is. I really did not like the idea that he just figures out he can do this, like it's genetics and he accidentally discovers he can warp. I know this is just a movie for entertainment, but even in a non fiction world, you want some sort of explanation to what causes this. I'd have bought into a magic ring, or an ancient crystal that gives them these powers, but to just have him figure it out like he was born with it just did not feel like it was the right way to give him these powers.<br /><br />Also, they should have explored the fun you could have with such powers. It seems like he just decides to rob bank vaults, and uses it to warp to a few places... if you had that kind of power, the first thing that comes to mind is probably not rob a bank vault, you'd probably be testing it to see what you can do, and how much of it. There is plenty of things they could have tried to make it seem like someone who really did have this power and could do anything, there where so many possibilities they could have explored.<br /><br />The battles between the jumpers and whatever they where did not seem to be thought out as well as it should. There is no explanation as to why jumpers are being killed, apart from jealousy from a religious type of hunter group.<br /><br />So many possibilities where unexplored, and so many reasons and \\"whys\\"<br />left unanswered.<br /><br />Many people are saying this is an original concept. No it's not. This seems like they have taken ideas from \\"Click\\" and \\"TimeCop\\" and mixed it with a lot of concepts you see from b-grade horror movies and wrapped it up in a normal human being who is not from hell or has a thirst for blood.<br /><br />It's just usually you see these warp things in demons, or evil, aliens or angels or gods or something, so it's not an original concept, just the idea to put it into someone normal, but far from original, as there have been movies made where a normal person can do this kind of thing.<br /><br />Overall I think they could have done a much better job with this story wise. It came off feeling pretty average and so many questions left unanswered. And if that is a set up for a sequel, then this series has already failed for doing it on purpose before they know if the movie was a success or not... people aren't as stupid as the movie companies want them to be.<br /><br />the extras seemed pretty boring. So I expect there holding back a few months before the release a special directors cut edition, which will fail the market as people either refuse to buy it, or copy it or download it... and the movie companies wonder why piracy is running rampart these days.<br /><br />Overall, fans of Anikin will flock over this and praise it, no matter what he is in. but to the average viewer, this is a pretty average movie that could have been done so much better if it focused more on entertainment then the FX of the movie.<br /><br />2 and half stars from me.

B00004SVIK|4.0|While this might be a great collection of live songs comprising \\"The Wall\\" from Earl's Court, there is an unofficial video of one of the Earl's Court shows that is, IMHO, much more pleasing. Though imperfect, I have to believe that this show could be restored and officially released. It's clear that it was professionally filmed for some reason. Incidentally, though i don't know if they're credited on this CD, the Floyd had a complete backing band on this tour- a second guitar, bass player, drummer, and keyboard player. The power of some of the live songs is a result, in part, of the fact that there are, essentially, two bands playing the same song at the same time. Obviously, they've got the audio cleaned up well, if they would just clean up the video, we'd have a fantastic DVD release.
0452289963|5.0|I have been involved with Buddhist thought and meditation for a few years now and despite the comment of some others, I found a lot of value in Eckhart's Book.  Yes, it seemed to me that much of what Eckhart presents is basically Buddhist in nature but, reflecting back to my earlier work with Christianity, I could also say Eckhart's work presents basically Christian views as well.  Okay, perhaps not Christianity as it is taught by many churches today, but perhaps as Christ intended it in the first place.  Taking this further, if one believes there is a fundamental truth, than all honest seekers of that truth, no matter what religion they begin with, should eventually end up in the same place.  Even though my first thougths were similar to some of the reviewers (this is just Buddhism), I soon realized that was my ego trying to fool me into thoughts of superiority and that, in reality, no labels such as Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, etc. actually have any importance of meaning when searching for truth.    Another of my initial thoughts on the book was \\"Ah, this is Buddhism for Westerners.\\"  I think that still applies as Eckhart's book did very much help me better understand some Buddhist concepts that were partially escaping me.    So my advice to everyone no matter what faith you are, calm your egos. Some Buddhists are bound to say \\"Buddha is better\\", some Christains, \\"Christ was God (and Better)\\", some Jews (Moses and Abraham were better\\", so on and so forth.  But actually such thoughts make no sense as there is nothing to be compared, it isn't a contest, and the label one applies to truth is of no importance.    As far as Eckhart's ego,  I really have not sensed much ego here.  We must all remember that Eckhart is only human though.  Therefore, just as many of the apostles were far from perfect, don't expect Eckhart to be immune to human failings from time to time.  I'm not trying to put Eckhart in the class of a prophet, I assure you, and there is no need to do so.  All that is important is that you get out of it what you can, if anything.    I agree that Eckhart's teachings are in danger of becoming the next fad wherein yuppees sit around at starbucks exchanging their enlightenment stories but that is  a comment about humanity not Eckhart's teachings or ideas.  And I also agree that I don't think Oprah has actually experienced much in the way of enlightenment despite how she might act or speak.  However, she is doing us a service.  Humanity is in need of a chnage of their state of consciousness and this book can help some.  I suspect most will consume it with their egos just as humanity has largely done in the past.  Only a few will truly engage in the work necessary to change their state of consciousness.  It involves a lot of up front sacrifice for most.  I am still very much in the struggle. But I think Eckhart's book, \\"The New Earth\\" is excellent and well worth the read.  If you want to get something out of it you can.  If you let your ego say, \\"This book is an insult to Jesus, God, Buddha, Mohammed, Abraham, Moses, etc., etc., etc.,\\" you can do that to and you'll probably only be angered by the book.    Like always, it's up to you.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall - E isn't so much a movie as it is an artistic statement.  I had my hesitations about seeing this in the theater despite the critical acclaim.  I came out of the theater feeling very happy and very impressed.  The DVD version is just as good and I actually like the funky box it came it.    Pixar took some risks with this one.  To make an almost silent movie took a great deal of courage on their part, but it paid off.  I really didn't think a little robot could project so much feeling and emotion but Wall - E  and Eve are brilliant.  From the first time Wall - E  is watching tv and brings his hands together, you just can't help but fall in love with the little guy.  For those of you who are still on the fence regarding whether or not to see this movie.  Try to picture a movie about R2D2.  A lot of noise, a lot of blips and a ton of humor and personality.    Let's get the obvious out of the way first.  The FX???  It's Pixar folks, at this point the public has come to expect excellent FX. Anything less than stellar would be unacceptable.  Wall - E succeeds in every way visually, but really.....isn't this just expected by now?    Nope, Wall - E `s genius isn't behind it's visuals but behind a story that is genuinely touching.  Some people have complained that the story is too heavy handed about human's destroying the planet.  And yes..............it's a tad preachy but I didn't find it overwhelming nor did it distract me from the main story of Eve and Wall - E.    It's just a very cute, very clever movie in every way.  I want to say more but I really don't want to give that much away about the story itself.    What didn't I like about Wall - E?  It felt a tad long, maybe a half hour longer than it needed to be.  And I really can't see little children being interested in this movie.  This really is Pixar's most adult oriented animated movie yet.  Not to say that it contains any adult content, it doesn't.  But considering the movie is basically silent, I think adultswill get it more than kids.  Repeat viewings only make it that much better.    I'll sum it up like this.  Wall - E is simply the most daring, beautiful, and artistic movie to come out of Hollywood since Fantasia.  And yes, Wall - E surpasses Fantasia in every way imaginable.  Gorgeous, stunning, and epic.  Wall - E is a must see for anyone out there who still has a heart.  Highly Recommended!!!
B00006AVRK|5.0|This collection captures Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie at their best.  Splendid farce that bites at its subject matter without going overboard or losing the joy of it.  Great for all ages but it is best for those of us who have been around long enough to catch some of the more obscure references.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I have often been intrigued by the multitalented Jethro Tull since the seventies. Thick as a Brick is a nice package for the listener who wants a change of pace from the tiring pop music and the typical, overplayed, classic rock that are so often geared to specific age groups or audiences. This should be on many a magazine's list of 100 Greatest Albums of All Time.    Even attempts at cultural and musical format crossovers by many have not impressed me. What UK acts such as Donovan and The Beatles did for the 1960s, Jethro Tull did for the 1970s. Just as the prominence of the violin in the Beatles' Eleanor Rigby and the use of the harmonized guitar riffs with the harpsichord in Donovan's Sunshine Superman were groundbreaking, Ian Anderson's perpetual transition from flute to trumpet to saxophone to acoustic guitar was no less musically original.    Released in 1972, Thick as a Brick is regarded as Jethro Tull's definitive progressive rock album. Like the Beatles' Sergeant Pepper with its printed song lyrics and Dylan's Blonde on Blonde in the never-before-released packaging of two discs of exclusively new material, Thick as a Brick has its own distinctive first: a full length LP with a continuous song on both sides.    Lavishly produced for its time, Thick as a Brick was supported by a tour with a stage production that was every bit as lavish and represented what possibly might have been the pinnacle of Tull's popularity, a time when the group was also raking in the sales of the now-immortalized, U.S. certified triple platinum album from the year before, namely Aqualung.

B00006IU73|5.0|I am a relative new comer to Porcupine Tree. A longtime fan of progressive or just good music in general, I can't believe I am just now finding out about this great band. Better late than never though. Being a musician myself, I appreciate good musicianship and especially tasteful playing. I started out with In Absentia and Deadwing. Next came Fear of a Blank Planet and the newly released Nil Recurring. The first time I heard both In Absentia and Deadwing I was not real impressed. Looking back, I think this was because I had very high expectations from reading the reviews here - and the music is so different than anything I expected. After a couple of more listens to In Absentia and Deadwing, I couldn't get enough! In Absentia and Deadwing each contains enough great music to make most other artists catalogs envious. The musicianship is impeccable as is the song crafting and even the album flow. If you have not heard Porcupine Tree, set aside some money and start collecting their CD's. Start with In Absentia or Deadwing. When you get the CD's, set aside some listening time and play them all the way through. From there I would get Fear of a Blank Planet and it's follow-up CD, Nil Recurring or the excellent concert 2 DVD set, \\"Arriving Somewhere.\\"  I now have every studio album from PT except for \\"On the Sunday of Life\\". Each album is unique and pays you with its own rewards. If you like good music, you are going to like PT. Two of their slightly older CD's have been remastered and contain a bonus DVDA 5.1 DTS mix of the entire CD with bonus tracks. If you have a good surround sound system, these are must have CD's. They are \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and \\"Stupid Dream.\\" The surround mixes are excellent and are not gimmicky like some others are. It's an experience all its own. Needless to say, I am excited to find this great music that is PT and will be writing a review of each album as I have time. I just know that for music lovers, you have a hole in your life that needs to befilled with the music of Porcupine Tree. Start listening now and you will never be the same.

1594489505|5.0|Afghanistan comes vividly to life in this forceful enduring tale of the hardships in the lives of many Afghans, but mainly those of two unforgettable and resilient heroic women, Mariam and Laila.<br /><br />The bonds formed from shared struggles, sacrifices and survivals become deeply moving and  indestructible in the face of an ultimate unflinching sacrifice.<br /><br />I was not going to read this book, as I felt I had been spending too much time in this part of the world in previously read books and didn't want to struggle anymore with `patriarchal despotism' in the treatment of women. When, I found tears welling in my eyes toward the end of this book...a true testament to fortitude, family, love, and loyalties, I was so glad I had decided to spend the time!<br /><br />This story was jarring while being profoundly emotionally emphatic.... Mariam and Laila are vividly drawn and once I got to know them, I knew that I'd not soon forget them.<br /><br />I'm grateful for the journey...though not always a `sun-drenched' landscape...it certainly was a splendid odyssey into an important awareness of the plight of our Afghan sisters and the into the mindset of the Taliban and the dangerous political environment that continues to flourish in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Hats off to Khaled Hosseini for this stunning, searing epic!
630438551X|5.0|Amazing Actors, wonderful cinematography, this movie is a great update of Shakespeare.  It keeps with the original language of the play, (which may sound suprisingly modern to some at certain points).  The only thing that disapointed me was that it contains only about 1/3 of the original play, But what else can you expect in the age of A.D.D.?

B00168OINA|4.0|When you climb aboard a roller coaster, you pretty much know what you're in for. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, like all of the Indy movies, is that kind of breathless,bumpy ride. Part of the fun is seeing older Indy, who now is more willing to accept his real name. He's also more willing to allow himself to love. Part of the fun is the non-stop action. Yeah, we know Indy and company are going to get beaten up - a lot - but sometimes crazy and implausible is better. Ford is still Indy, Karen Allen is still able to match him, and Shia LeBoeuf brings a freshness to the romp. And I never recognized John Hurt, whose performance is amazing. The special effects are incredible -literally. And the ending - the one at the college, not the Mayan temple - is satisfying.<br /><br />This is all brain candy, so sit back, relax with a barrel of popcorn, and have a good time. Sometimes you just want to be entertained.

The Californian Gov's in fine form, fragging bad guys and sending them off with his trademark one liners.     One of the Arnold's brawny best puts most modern action films to shame for sheer high testosterone impact, executed with muscular style and vigour by Director John McTiernan.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I can honestly say that I was not a huge John Mayer fan in the past because his music simply turned me off with his adult contemporary/pop songs such as Your Body Is A Wonderland. As of today however, he has become an incredible artist whose guitar playing can appeal to various guitar geeks, while his songs can appeal to a wide range of audiences ranging from teenage girls who just listen to him because he is \\"hot\\" or those who have an open mind to different types of music. I can say that I first became a fan of John Mayer with the Trio album and then I listened to Continuum. I was thinking it was just going to be another acoustic pop John Mayer record but I was sorely mistaken. This is my favorite album by Mr. Mayer because you get the John Mayer Trio (the blusey side that sounds a bit like SRV, Hendrix, Buddy Guy, BB King, etc.), the sensitive songwriter personality (even that part of the album isn't that bad), and the band set (which consists of mostly Continuum cuts) all in one package. This album proves that Mr. Mayer has matured as a musician and is a force to be reckoned with. I can honestly say that I now look forward to any future projects by John Mayer.
B0010X745K|1.0|I can't believe what I just watched.    I know King is bizarre but after sitting through a B-movie like scare flick, I had to watch a father shoot his own son -to save him- only to have the military arrive minutes later???? That is just wrong.    I watched TV-like special effects, people sacrifice eachother, murder, and bloody/gross scenes only to be confronted with an unimagineal ending of killing your own son??    If you even think of buying, renting , or watching this movie you should have your head examined. How do I get back that 2 hrs of my life?

Good variety of songs and sounds that is just good to<br />get lost in..if you close your eyes and kick back and listen, it's<br />GREAT. Bravo Priest....! Keep it coming!  Atreides
0385337388|4.0|I read this book years ago, but I still use references from it today with friends and medical colleagues.  I even now have a faculty job at one of the referenced hallowed institutions.  It's hilarious, focally outrageous, and somewhat self-serving, but it did have some salient, useful insight.  Now I want to read it again.

There isn't a song  on it that I don't like.  They have most certainly changed up their sound, but not the feel of their music.

1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now is one of those rare books that can change not only your life but also your mind.  And it is precisely mind, according to author Eckhart Tolle, that causes so much of the distress that we see in the world today.  Presenting a view that is gaining popularity among New Age thinkers--even as it departs radically from traditional psychology--Tolle explains, with stunning clarity and insight, that it is human beings' excessive identification with their minds that brings them pain and suffering.  In Tolle's view, mind and ego are virtually synonymous, and it is only through detachment from the mind, or \\"watching\\" the mind at work, that we become \\"conscious\\" enough to appreciate the present moment, where true power resides.    Tolle has an uncanny ability to take great mystical insights and serve them up in language perfectly digestible to modern readers.  In some respects, what he is offering is not wholly new.  For example, continual observation of the mind is a cornerstone of Zen philosophy and meditative practice.  Western spiritual thinkers, too, such as Rudolph Steiner, have emphasized the watching of one's own mind at work as a major step toward spiritual enlightenment.      This is the type of book you come back to again and again and derive heightened insight with each rereading.  It is also one of those books that you can open to any page and find genuine nuggets of timeless wisdom.  Having enjoyed the book so much, I recently decided to purchase the audiotape version of the book.  It should come as no surprise that Tolle's mellifluous voice bespeaks the presence of one who has lived his own teaching and achieved profound serenity.  He is a great companion for the open road, just as the original book is a must-read for anyone who seeks sanity in an increasingly insane world.
0345479092|2.0|Rather boring. She says alot of what is common sense to most moms and there are no \\"secrets\\" to what mother nature gave us. I would not recommend it to friends or family. The one positive - its a really cheap book!
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Recently discovered this band and I must say this is something special!  At age 48 I have heard so much stuff and over the past years I thought I had just gotten too old (as it would be presumptuous to claim that modern music is going nowhere fast).  So for those that listened and still listen to Prefab Sprout, Joy Division and even New Order, for those that enjoyed Echo and the Bunnymen's Heaven Up Here, well, check out these kids from Canada.  It might just blow you away.  Yes, the production is not always perfect, but these issues are just dwarfed by the great lyrics and the excellent timing of each element in the compositions.  If you want to try it out with a download of a song or two, I suggest that you go for:<br />1. No cars go<br />2. Keep the car running<br />3. Antichrist television blues<br />4. Windowsill<br />Each of these songs have different elements to them and the lyrics on Windowsill just freaked me out (\\"you can't forgive what you can't forget\\")!<br />Enough already, have to get back to my iPod and this \\"urgent\\" music.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|Based on the1970s true story about a group of amateur crooks who rob a British bank and get away with a little more than some cash and jewels.  They think they have a once in a lifetime opportunity when they find out the bank's security system is temporarily out of service.  What they don't know is that they're being used by government agents to retrieve some incriminating photos of a princess caught in the act of engaging in some undiscriminating sexual behavior.  Before they know it, they are being hunted down by government agents, police and mobsters who were storing their own incriminating evidence in those very same safety deposit boxes.    \\"The Bank Job\\" is an edge of your seat heist movie.  The fact that it is based on true events make this film all that much more interesting.  Don't get the feeling that your getting an \\"Oceans\\" type heist movie.  No high tech gadgetry or disguises here.  It's shovels and jackhammers, a good ol' get your hands dirty robbery.    Jason Statham proves once and for all that he is capable of being a good actor.  He nearly goes the entire movie without hitting somebody.  Overall the entire cast was brilliant.  \\"The Bank Job\\" has enough action, plot twists and suspense to keep you entertained throughout and will leave you feeling fully satisfied when the credits roll.
0783230079|4.0|Was disappointed that the movie was sent in widescreen.  Would like regular screen CD.
0784011710|5.0|This was my first time viewing the film-even though I knew going in what Sophie's choice was. (It's not like movie goers keep secrets) and I have to say this is an excellent character study film.  Meryl Streep definitely earned her Oscar with this one.  Amazing she could sound native on just a three month emerge study.  Sophie's story is heart breaking.  An A+++ script, wonderful direction.  A definite classic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am a tv snob and hardly watch any of the crap that's on now days. That's why I missed this jewel when it was originally being aired. It's a tragedy that it's gone. It's not just a one of the best sci fi shows but one of the best all time. Joss Whedon's character development, interplay, dialogue, story lines, etc. are so well thought out and coherent that you can't just pick one strength. If more people were exposed to these shows, it would have been a hit. No doubt. I really miss these characters.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Brave New World is better than most comeback albums that bands come back with. Metal bands always say \\"we're returning to our roots!\\" or \\"we're going to really push the envelope and go all out with this!\\" Brave New World actually does a little of both. Iron Maiden shoots for a very epic sound while using the classic Maiden techniques. Some of the songs are a little slow at some points, but none are bad. These points are what brings the album down to only four stars. Maiden picked up the pace a bit in the two albums that followed though, especially in A Matter of Life and Death.    All in all, this is a great album that belongs in any Iron Maiden fan's collection.    Personal song picks:    The Wicker Man  Ghost of the Navigator  The Nomad  Out of the Silent Planet
0891419195|5.0|This book is a personal memoir of a US Marine who was a member of a front line company (Company K, 3 battalion, 5th Marine Regiment) in two World War II Pacific theater campaigns. It is not about tactics, operations, or strategy, but about what life was like for for men in front line units in the Pacific, the dangers and the depravations they faced. This book is important because of the perspective it can give the reader.<br /><br />Though its focus is almost entirely on one small band of men (the men of Company K), it provides the reader with important context for understanding the world. Most obviously it gives one a window into what it means to be solider and the \\"face of battle\\", how war brings out the best and the worst in human kind,  how disease and stress can be as deadly as bullets and shell fragments, and how dehumanizing the whole experience  can be.  Reading this first hand account makes these statements more than cliches, it makes the personal cost of war tangible in a way third person accounts can not.<br /><br />Although I suspect this wasn't the authors goal, the book also provides those of us in the post baby boom generations an important perspective that can help us make sense of the arc of history from World War I to 80's.  During the World Wars hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people had similar experiences, it must have had a profound impact on how they approached the world, which in turn must of have shaped the inter War and post War periods.  Before reading this account I wasn't able to  really appreciate how World War I lead to an increase in nihilism or the pain Vietnam War protests must have caused some veterans. Without reading this (or a similar account) one can't have a full grasp on modern history.
0156030209|4.0|Interesting book, although it drags on a little in the middle. At the end of the book I found myself trying to analyze all plausible meanings of the entire book.

0307346617|5.0|This book is not really a horror book filled with gore, but it is a fascinating page turner nonetheless. Through the multiple first person accounts of the battle for survival in a post apocalyptic zombie ruled world, Brooks is able to emerge the reader into a world that has been consumed by the living dead. His references to contemporary foreign policy and his accurate accounting of and maneuvering through the contemporary military mindset and lingo (at least American, according to this former Marine) gives his book a, \\"Wow, I could see this actually happening!\\" feel.<br /><br />And rather than exploring the \\"LaMOE\\" (Last Man on Earth) perspective commonly found in zombie media, this delves into every reasonable facet of culture. If there were a WWZ, this book goes very far into encompassing all the elements that would make up contemporary policy and life on this little blue planet.

B0013FBS20|5.0|Will Smith again proves why he is the biggest actor in Hollywood right now. His acting in Legend is the best he's done so far, and makes an already great concept better. The extra features are good, and the animated shorts especially are just great. The alternate ending, though worth it, is a little is iffy to me. I think this movie is worth the price. Oh, and it looks good too.
6305308659|4.0|Gary Ross's 1998 hit \\"Pleasantville\\" came as a, well, pleasant, surprise.  This reviewer tends to shun works whose hallmarks are teen angst and cleverness for its own sake.  Pleasantville, however, despite rolling in cleverness, manages to transcend its cleverness and its teen-angst focus, and exudes genuine charm and something of a soul.  This is due partly to the excellent performances, partly to the sharp production that includes a wonderful original score by Randy Newman (yup, another one) incorporating iconic music of the 1950s, and partly to the fact that the film's clear point of view isn't heavy-handed.    David Wagner (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high-schooler in the 1990s whose cheerless home, divorced parents, depressed mother, and contemptuous, slutty sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), have left him susceptible to the wistful charms of a 1950s black and white TV sitcom about one of those always and effortlessly Happy Families.  The show, Pleasantville, features two siblings named Bud and Mary Sue who are about David's and Jennifer's ages.  David is so addicted to this sitcom that, as the film opens, he is preparing to watch a weekend marathon of the show, and to compete in a contest among devotees to see who can remember the most details from the entire history of the program.    Just as David sits down to the beginning of the marathon, Jennifer appears and claims TV rights: she had planned to watch a rock concert that evening in the company of the school's most notorious stud, who she plans to seduce.  David and Jennifer begin to struggle over the TV remote and break it, apparently rendering the issue moot.  However, David's acute longing for the tranquillity and happiness portrayed in Pleasantville attracts the notice of a mysterious TV \\"repairman\\" (Don Knotts) who suddenly appears on the doorstep with a new \\"remote\\".  The struggle for control of the TV is reignited, but this time, as David and Jennifer tug at the remote, they push a button that drawsthem through the television set and into the world of Pleasantville, which was on as they fought.    In an eyeblink, David and Jennifer Wagner find themselves cast in the roles of Bud and Mary Sue Parker, complete with era-appropriate clothing (\\"five pounds of underwear\\" Jennifer hisses, tugging at the pointy, underwire bra, girdle, slip, and stockings under the poodle skirt, demure blouse, and sweater she finds herself wearing).  The two have been transported from the splashy, morally freewheeling, noisy technicolor world of the 1990s into the black-and-white, serene, orderly world of Pleasantville.  Mom and Dad (marvellously rendered without a trace of  irony by Joan Allen and William H. Macy) never quarrel; meals are fulsome and on time; everyone eats together at the table; the basketball team always wins its games; the weather is always perfect.     Guided by David's knowledge of the show, he and Jennifer cautiously begin navigating their new world as they try to figure out how to get home.  Inevitably, the mores of David and Jennifer begin to impact the world of Pleasantville - and vice versa.  And that last factor is the one that saves the film from predictability.  David, initially more comfortable with and accepting of the limitations of Pleasantville, wants to get home without disturbing this cultural environment, to which he at first applies a sort of hands-off Prime Directive.  Jennifer, on the other hand, initially despises her role as Mary Sue, is bored witless, and sets out to make mischief as soon as she can, starting with a heavy makeout session in Lover's Lane with the captain of the basketball team.  As Jennifer introduces the disturbance of sex into the equilibrium of Pleasantville, the effect ripples out, and the mature inhabitants of the town are startled to see their enviroment shifting into . . . color.  Of course, with the splotches of color (a red rose, a green sportscar, a tight red sweater, pink and green bathroom tiles. . .) come shiftsin behavior and outlook, mostly concentrated among the young high school crowd.    It looks as if David and Jennifer are the ones effecting change, but eventually it becomes clear that they are also being changed.  David finds himself, surprisingly, rebelling against the limitations of Pleasantville, and uncovers a decidedly non-nerdy core.  Jennifer, on the other hand, finds that the town slut role has become rather old, and in the persona of the studious Mary Sue, uncovers a surprising new direction.  By the time David and Jennifer find the way home, they have more or less switched \\"sides\\" where Pleasantville is concerned - of course, it's the new, full-color Pleasantville, but. . .    The filmmakers are not shy about their central viewpoint that it really isn't possible to repress the essential self, and that the dangers of freedom and self-expression are worth its rewards.  Nevertheless, film also points up aspects of modern culture that can make a place like Pleasantville look so attractive.  Nicely written and produced, Pleasantville works very well as pure fantasy, as well as allegory.  This reviewer has watched the film several times with great pleasure.  Tobey Maguire's endearing performance as the quirky David is the core of the film, but he is ably supported by Reese Witherspoon's wicked Jennifer, who is not nearly as dumb as she pretends, and some surprisingly moving moments from Joan Allen and William H. Macy as Mom and Dad Parker.    You will find the film's double bulls-eye most apparent in the number of people who wish David and Jennifer had left well enough alone in Pleasantville.
0195067142|5.0|Anyone who believes combat is a visceral experience similar to that seen in the movie 300 needs to read this book. Mr Sledge's book is recommended reading for every enlisted Marine at the beginning of his career.

B00004HYLF|5.0|Return to Forever's Romantic Warrior is a fantastic album. Stanley Clarke has become one of my favorite bass players after hearing this and other Return to Forever albums. He lays down a great bass line in Sorceress around 2 minutes into the song that made for a great jam. Chick Corea's solo on romantic Warrior is something special. What I think makes this album so great is how easily the band can move from one idea to the next without disrupting the flow of the music. I highly recommend this to jazz and funk fans. It might be Return to Forever's best album.
B00005JNEW|4.0|I am a woman.  I am a woman who doesn't follow sports much in real life, nor do I watch movies about sports.  The only reason I picked this up was because I have a thing for Garrett Hedlund as eye candy and I am a fan of Billy Bob Thornton.  I could care less about a football movie.  Still, this was a good movie.  Following in the footsteps of the great sports movies (The Natural, Rudy, Rocky, etc.), we are rooting for the underdog and feeling a great joy when someone triumphs over a great obsticle.      We are following the 1988 high school football season of the Panthers in a small Texas town.  We are in America's heartland, Texas, a state that practically throbs with national pride and a love of football.  Football is important, and you feel the exuberance of all the star team members as they interact with the townsfolk and media.  Each has their own struggle, Garret Hedlund's probably being the most with an abusive father (Time McGraw) and his obvious popularity with the girls (gotta love that scene where the girl gives him a Rice Krispy sculpture!).  Billy Bob is a stereotypical hard nosed coach, gruff and demanding.  He pushes them as hard as he can.  And they triumph.    A great feel good movie about overcoming.  It just happens to be a sports movie too.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|When I heard Brian Eno was working with Coldplay I made a mental note.  I've been a fan of his sound since '79. It was generous of U2 to share him, and Viva La Vida is very satisfying.  Yes, it does remind me of the mid-late 80's sound of U2, but it's been a long time, and it sounds fresh and needed. Some think this is an artsy, adventurous album. It is, but I also think it will have broad appeal and possibly even win a few awards. It feels like a trip around the world and through history.

B00065GX64|4.0|Perhaps the very first serial killer film ever made--way back in l931!    Although, as far as directors go, I preffer the works of Claude Chabrol (especially Chabrol's The Butcher, over Lang's M), Lang's M holds up pretty damn well.    What you really get here is three films in one: first third feels like a serial killer film, middle third feels like a police procedural, and the last third feels like a crime caper flick.  For me, the first and last third worked exceptionally well. Peter Lorre convincing in the title role. Middle part (with the cops doing what cops do) lagged and felt drawn out, only because we have seen so many scenes like this over the years in other films of this nature.    Friedkin interviews Lang in the two-disk package.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|During the Summer I lighten up on movies since I know some of them won't win Academy Awards. That's because they are focused towards action and fun which the Academy usually frowns upon. With the exception of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" how often have you seen them give it to fun movies? Afterall \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Anger Management\\" certainly weren't about to get one. So don't expect \\"Jumpers\\" to be anything more than it is, a fun action movie. Now I grant you I have a couple questions. Did his father survive? Who funded the Paladins? Where they really working for NSA? Why did his mother have a kid if jumping is genetic? If Paladins can jump, aren't they a jumper too? Okay I had more than a couple questions not being answered, but overall I liked the ride.<br /><br />Some will say robbing banks or Paladins killing innocent people is setting a bad precedent for kids to watch. I agree. Have you thrown out your families \\"Grand Theft Auto IV\\" yet? Yeah right, so let's not be so judgemental on this movie. The main character is none other than Hayden Christensen of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader fame. He does a decent job playing the part of a Jumper. Samuel Jackson unfortunately doesn't really get much opportunity to show his ability acting as one of the bloodthirsty Paladins. Worse yet, we barely see the lovely and talented Diane Lane.<br /><br />The movie starts us with a boy saving his own life, by jumping to a library he knew as a child, when he falls in a icy lake. As the story evolves we find out Jumpers typically start jumping at age five. For some unknown reason we find that Paladins since medieval times have killed jumpers. Sorry this is one premise I couldn't accept. Paladins have always been portrayed as good and guarding religious people from harm. Convincing me this means they would kill people for jumping into a bank and robbing  it is stretching it thin. They would have been better off to just make the government in pursuit of them, specifically Homeland Security or NSA. Even then it would need to be if captured a Jumper would face imprisonment not death if they were guilty of lesser than capital crimes. Now that I got that out of my system, I still like the movie for the most part. The story wasn't bad, the acting decent, and the effects great. Not a bad Summer movie at all. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. - C. Lusterwould need to be if captured a Jumper would face imprisonment not death if they were guilty of lesser than capital crimes.

Not only has the information made me hopeful about a possible resolution for my problems, it would be fascinating for anyone who has an interest in science and anatomy.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Of course, reviewers are going to complain about the shaky camcorder photography. Whether or not it made them dizzy or ill depends upon their own sensibilities; perhaps they are the people who become easily car sick or air sick; perhaps on the big screen in a dark theatre the moving images are magnified. I don't know; I viewed it on DVD.<br /><br />Okay. But without the camcorder perspective, what do we have? Another throwback to 1950s post-atomic fallout science-fiction with giant squids, giant octopii, scorpians, locusts, spiders, ants, and preying mantises -- all the result of man's carelessness with nuclear detonations? The story, of course, is nothing: Beth and Rob \\"had sex\\" (woooooooo -- how old are these people? young sophisticated New York Yuppies or midwestern twelve-year-olds?) No. The story is nothing, but the presentation is everything -- point of view is the central gimmick and existential premise. Versimilitude is all -- the unreal is made to look real.<br /><br />Film scholar Louis D. Giannetti reminded us years ago that each new camera set-up in a motion picture, between or even within shots, presents viewers with a new perspective from which to evaluate what they see. Films, for example, often combine omniscient narration with the first person, and the director may cut directly from first-person subjective point-of-view shots to objective camera angles, from close-ups to gauge reactions of single characters to long shots [UNDERSTAND MOVIES. 2nd ed. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1976].<br /><br />Many films have, through the years, relied heavily on the subjective camera (e.g., LADY IN THE LAKE, 1946) and those FRIDAY THE 13th blood- baths where horny teenages at Crystal Lake are murdered one by one. In Jack Arnold's 3-D film IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE, 1953), audiences are given control over the earthlings because the point of view when they confront the aliens is from the aliens' perspective, a device that allows the audience to see the earthlings as victims. The residents of the sleepy desert town of Sand Rock, Arizona, fimd themselves enveloped in the billowing fog that borders the vision of the viewers while they stalk victims from behind the bubble-eye of the aliens.<br /><br />CLOVERFIELD is part of this subjective camera sub-genre. It begins disarmingly enough with a clever, non-horror title -- quite inspired -- not what one would expect for a monster movie like those of the 1950s or the awful Godzilla imports. The tape found in the camcorder is the whole story -- from the beginning when Rob is sneaking up on Beth during the morning-after sequence to the Coney Island close-ups of Beth giggling into the lens -- to the ending when we are back at Coney Island, the part of the tape which was not inadvertently taped over by beginner videographer \\"Hud\\" (coaxed into taking on videotaping chores by the hero's brother who wants a record of the party which is celebrating the brother's departure to Japan). The ending of the tape is the ending of the film, showing Rob and Beth's idyllic time together before the mayhem -- the tape which has now, according to the beginning of the film, become part of an official government documentation of the events.<br /><br />The New York setting provides understandable echoes of 9-11 -- another terrorist attack, as some of the panicked characters speculate. Fortunately, the cinema verite plot focuses more on the fleeing citizens than on the scientists and military types that we saw in the 1950s, but with 21st century dialogue and profanity. Even one of the military officers looks like an alumnus from the TWIN PEAKS television series, but he is onscreen in only fleeting, hand-held shots. I wonder if he complained to his agent about this. We even see scenes of enterprising thieves breaking into an electronics store and looting it -- an aspect of disasters that, unfortunately, are all too real and commonplace. Even our hero, the Tom Cruise clone, steals a phone in order to call his trapped former girl friend, Beth. As they try to cross the bridge to Brooklyn, the hero's brother is wiped out, along with many others, when the tail of the gigantic creature descends on the historical structure. So much for being an iconoclast -- first the Statue of Liberty is decapitated; then the famous bridge is sawed in half. No respect.<br /><br />CLOVERFIELD may not be the overnight commercial success that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT enjoyed, but it is as least as effective, and the denouement is just as downbeat. Quit whining about the shaking camera and enjoy the experience for what it is supposed to be -- an exercise in verisimilitude.h.

B000002MTU|5.0|Anyone who appreciates the blues, especially from a guitarist's paradigm, will enjoy this recording. Clapton is always a delight. However, on this album you get to enjoy a cornacopia of Slowhand riffs and solos throughout every track.<br />If you do \\"air guitar\\", you'll want this disc.
B000003TAR|5.0|yaknow to all that use their brains can easily see why Nirvana was so great.     they embody everything a great rock band should have. amazing front man with amazing song writing abillities, an amazing drummer and a sound all their own that didnt suck!    this is a brash Cd with harsh tones with catchy songs that stick in your head with great lyrics.
B00122IYJY|5.0|Ok, I was buying the Jamie's Crying mp3 and I noticed that Van Halen 1 only got 4.5 stars with 306 reviews.  I had planned to sit back and ENJOY all of the samples but those 4.5 stars were a terrible reminder that something was seriously wrong with some people in this world.  I do not mean that maliciously as I am not a malicious person.  However, we are speaking of VAN HALEN 1 PEOPLE!!!  This is probably the absolute best album of all time.  This guys revolutionized just about everything in the business.  If they didn't they might as well have because EVERYONE loved them.      I seriously do not remember a single soul who do not at least like them.  Even the rednecks and preppies liked them and then you kinda had to force that out of them because they still wanted to make fun of the \\"freaks\\" who listed to rock and wore black clothes and smoked.  This is how friggin wonderful these guys are....I heard \\"You Really Got Me\\" on some movie about bored kids in suburbia with Matt Dillon playing his very first role, after being discovered skipping class at his school.  Anyway Matt Dillon gets killed in the end.  Sad, I like Matt Dillon.  But...THIS IS VAN HALEN PEOPLE!!!  I loved that song so very much and the credits were so messed up at the end of the movie that I could not see who the band was.  I was 14 and it was the summer before I started high school.  I went to the only record store in my town and searched through all the albums for the name of the SONG--You Really got Me.  Do you guys know how long that took me?  We are talking seriously long days, I mean the people at the store were beginning to become suspicious of me.  I could not find it.  None of my friends knew who it was either, we lived in a major \\"adult contemporary\\" town. They helped me in my search though like the loyal, loving, freak friends they were.  Imagine my thrill, my joy, my RELIEF at finally finding the words \\"You Really Got Me\\" on the back of the band Van Halen's 8 Track tape..  I finally found it at J.C. Penneys.  (Yes they sold music).  It was in the V's and it took me at least another 3 hours search to find it.      I had two friends and my sister with me.  We immediately rode our bikes back home to my house where we proceeded to skip to the \\"You Really Got Me\\" song.  We put the stereo on \\"10\\" and rocked out!!!  Thank God my mom and dad were at work!  Then the REAL surprise came when we listened to the whole 8 track.  It was unbelievable!!!  I think we just sat there with our mouths open and drooled, it was like Heaven.  Now, I have to state something I noticed about my fine friends who gave 5 stars.  I review a lot here and I read even more reviews.  I mean I read reviews for vitamins and cleaning supplies.  I really like to read reviews.  Reviews and forums, they are my facebook.      Anyway, I have NEVER, EVER, seen reviews as long as the 5 star ones for Van Halen 1.  Do you 1, 2, and 3 starers even get that?  There are about 6 each of you and over 250 5 stars.  I totally believe in individual taste.  Believe me, I was the total \\"underground music\\" and \\"pre-goth\\" movement girl.  But COME ON PEOPLE!!!  This is Van Halen.  I do not need to tell you of the musical talent, genius and charisma that this band put forth on their first album, my other reviewer companions have done so BEAUTIFULLY.  I could not state it any better than they have.  I just had to get this tension I felt from staring at those horrible 4.5 stars for too long off of my chest.      I am now 41, a wife, a mother, a college graduate, an about to be teacher, a published poet and a kitty cat lover.  When I hear anything from this album I am simply a 14 year old, skinny, innocent and shy little girl experiencing pure rock and roll for the first time in her life.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|If you are a Killers fan or a fan of music in general then you have to buy this album it is amazing! The compilation of different sounds on this album is enough to buy it just to hear their range. My suggestion is that you quit reading this review and buy it right now:) No,Seriously.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Very intriguing British mystery.  Thoroughly enjoyed it but I must admit I had to use English subtitles since some of the accents were pretty heavy.  I recommend it.
B000W4HFY8|5.0|It was a pleasant surprise to find out this CD was available.  The Twin Peaks mythos continues to grow, albiet slowly, years after the final show aired.<br /><br />Music was, of course, central to the dark theme and mood of the show, and to find additional songs in digital quality is a treat, an unexpected one at that.<br /><br />...and I gotta throw my two cents in on the song left out of the CD that should be in: when James is riding his Harley around at the beginning of that 2nd season episode, that full-reverb, clean-electric guitar rock n' roll riff.  That was one of my favorites!
0452289963|1.0|Ok, so it may not be Buddhism repackaged, but it definitely is Spiritualism repackaged.<br /><br />The basic information and the Spiritual Laws reflected are worth knowing, but the book is bland.  According the the author, if you don't derive benefit from it, it is the reader's fault.  Gee, Echkart, I'm sorry I didn't live up to your expectations.<br /><br />I wouldn't consider the book a waste of time, but it lacked a fresh perspective to separate it from the pack.
B00005614M|5.0|When you realize that these sides were cut in 1949, you can only but marvel at the sophistication of both the music and the sound.  For those of you that might think that anything recorded almost 60 years ago must sound primitive, think again.  This is modern music, timeless music, and will pay dividends on a good sound system.  How many 58 year old recording can say that?  This is great stuff, period.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This is a AWESOME CD. For those of you who are and want to be a Donna Summer fan yes the Queen is back as one of her song says. From the first song \\"Stamp your feet\\" to the last song on the CD this is a extraordinary piece of work by the Disco Queen of the late 70's and early 80's. She has mixed so many types of music in this CD. The lady can still sang and is as beautiful as ever. It's a short review I just hope you buy the CD as I did and enjoy it as much as I have.
B00127RAJY|5.0|What I love about this workout is that there's nothing that is confusing.  It's all stuff (calisthenics) you've done before- sit ups, push ups, jumping jacks, lunges.  I do have to say I consider myself in okay shape- I'm not going to run a marathon anytime soon but I can do a 5k with just a little training.  Anyway, this workout kicked my a$& all over the room.  I made it all the way through, but I have to admit I did the \\"accommodated\\" version of a few moves near the end.  I did the Level 1 workout (there are 3 Levels on this dvd) yesterday and today and I can feel it in my legs, abs and back but I'm not so sore that I couldn't get out of bed.  That's great as far as I'm concerned! I even have problems with lymphedema from surgeries in my leg and I was able to do this no pain/discomfort later. It's only a 20 minute work out with a nice 5 minute warmup with easy moves and a 5 minute good stretch/cool-down session at the end.  When you can get a great workout in 20 minutes, I consider that an accomplishment. Each workout is 3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength, and 1 minute of abs repeated over the 20 minutes. The dialog Jillian gives is very encouraging and educational, and gives tips on avoiding injury.  Even a little distracting for those times you need to be distracted.  I absolutely recommend this dvd to everyone.
B0019IB0II|3.0|excellent narrative about the event itself but I found the recovery aspect very light on fact and heavy on the resulting spirituality of her experience.
1881273156|4.0|I was introduced to this book by a woman I was dating.  Had I know how successful the book would have eventually been for her I would have left at that moment.  She was going through a divorce, and now believes this book saved her marriage.    Either way, I finished reading the book as a single man.  It did teach me a great number of things that were helpful to me.  Granted a number of things in the book are semi common-sense, but it offered a different take on many every day things most people overlook these days.    The things I learned I have applied in everyday life.  The few successful relationships I've had since reading this book have been absolutely amazing.  The vast majority of relationships I've had since reading this book have however have ended in disaster.  Most women I have dated or even had a connection with have, for the most part, shown displeasure or, in a few cases, disgust at my knowledge of my emotions and \\"love languages\\".    I do believe that one day the things I have learned may make a marriage great for me.  But, for now, as a twenty-something single man it's just wreaking havoc on my love life.    I would recommend, and do, the book to anyone who is married or in a long-term commited relationship.  To those of you like me however, that just aren't at the point in life where settling down is a top priority, I'd advise avoiding this book entirely.
B000YAA68C|5.0|this movie was so good!  you laughed, you smiled, you cried...well i more like sobbed!!  the story is beautiful and wonderful and makes you take account of all the things that you have and haven't said in your life.  a must see!

B0016A2FFG|5.0|In recent years Al Green has made some attempts at recapturing the Al Green of the 70's.  The previous two Albums I thought showed Green trying to find his way back to that time, trying to find his way back to the formula that made him what he was. Finally on \\"Lay It Down\\" Al Green has arrived. One of if not the best soul and R&B album of the year. \\"Lay It Down\\" proves that the king of soul is not Legend not yet, he is still to current and is able to reach down through the ages and vibrate your soul. On Lay it down when the chorus keeps in strong for the first time you start swaying in your car wanting to pull over and start dancing with the first person you see. I give it 5 Stars but it is worth so much.

0521673763|3.0|Útil: La cantidad de información resumida, sistematizada y esquematizada, de fácil y amena lectura.    Cuestionable: Para empezar, no tanto el grado de simplificación, como el grado de parcialización, fragmentación y reducción de los contenidos referentes al funcionamiento normal y anormal del Sistema Nervioso Central, con un sesgo explícito hacia aquellos aspectos que ayudarían a entender mejor el supuesto funcionamiento de los psicofármacos, y con un sesgo implícito hacia la altamente cuestionable premisa de que los psicofármacos que hoy conocemos actuán verdaderamente sobre los fenómenos fundamentales de la \\"fisiopatología\\" neuro-psiquiátrica (suposición cada vez más cuestionable). Stahl parece querer explicarnos por qué y cómo es que funcionan los psicofármacos (con esquematismos que a menudo llegan a ser no sólo inaceptablemente sobresimplificados, sino también francamente inverosímiles), sin la menor intención de explicarnos por qué y cómo -si todo lo que nos explica es cierto- es que funcionan tan modestamente y en un porcentaje a veces tan reducido de pacientes. Como resultado, el aprendiz se verá tentado a basar sus prescripciones en el supuesto conocimiento de por qué tal o cual fármaco DEBIERA funcionar en tal o cual paciente (o en tal o cual síntoma!), sin preguntarse más bien por la evidencia acerca de si dicho fármaco funciona o no funciona realmente, y hasta qué punto... El posible riesgo de todo esto, es una peligrosa tendencia a la sobreprescripción y a la malprescripción (el posible beneficio, el mantenido enriquecimiento de la industria farmacéutica).    También parece cuestionable el enfoque akiskaliano de los trastornos del ánimo (que conduce a una mayor prescripción de profilácticos de fase, antipsicóticos atípicos y otros), y la presunción (a la DSM) de que todos los trastornos del ánimo merecen el estatuto implícito de enfermedad (en el sentido de la medicina científica), y deben ser tratados porlo tanto con medicamentos. El resultado, nuevamente: la sobreprescripción, incluyendo aquí la indicación de fármacos para el tratamiento de crisis vitales, reacciones vivenciales, dificultades de adaptación, cuadros de estrés laboral, disfunciones conyugales y familiares, y un larguísimo etcétera; todos casos que, cumpliendo los criterios diagnósticos de un 'episodio depresivo mayor' u otros, cabrían también (o 'en vez') en la categoría de reacciones depresivas, depresiones neuróticas / neurosis depresivas, disforias histeroides, depresiones caracterológicas, cuadros de ajuste, etc. Ningún clínico honesto y experimentado puede creer que esta distinción -esfumada como por arte de magia por el DSM- haya dejado de ser fundamental en la práctica.     Por último, la cantidad de afirmaciones del tipo 'pudiera ser que', 'es probable que', 'hipotéticamente' o 'teóricamente', no hacen más que alimentar todas nuestras dudas, si bien trasuntan un loable matiz de honestidad de parte del autor (hasta el punto de que en algunos pasajes nos advierte algo así como: las cosas son mucho más complejas y bien distintas en la realidad, pero bueno, vamos a hacer como que son así como se las estoy mostrando en estas laminitas tan lindas y explicativas, para que no nos compliquemos la existencia...). No deja de ser interesante, en todo caso, que la así llamada 'psiquiatría biológica' (supuestamente, la más 'científica' de 'las psiquiatrías') termine aglutinando tantas conjeturas, supuestos y especulaciones como cualquier corriente psicológica de los últimos cien años (y quizás más...)    En suma: Un libro digno de ser leído y estudiado, PERO con el sentido crítico bien despierto...
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I am a tough guy. I am a macho, macho, man. My pores leak testosterone when I sweat. I hate chick flicks. When I read this book I bawled like a baby. As an insight into human suffering in places like Afghanistan I highy recommend this novel.
B0012Q732O|4.0|This movie was very entertaining in my opinion. It had good acting, good special effects and a solid plot. Its true that this movie its very inaccurate when it comes to history, but I honestly think that a movie its made to entertain not be accurate. Apocalypto had many inaccuracies and the public still liked. I do not know why it cannot be the same for this movie.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Simply fantastic job at converting the book. Actually I've found the program to be a great compliment to David's 1776. It is just a shame that so much detail from the book was removed to fit into the mini-series.    Laura does a far better job than Paul though in my opinion and she out shines him in every scene, not to say that his performance was bad in any way.

B000ZLFALI|3.0|After buying Across the Universe, I decided to check out Amazon and see what others had to say about it. (And yes, maybe I should have done that first.) My eyes were instantly flooded with positive reviews for this film, but since I've heard (too often actually) all the nice things to say, I sifted through some of the negative reviews. The people who didn't enjoy this film pretty much hated it for all the same reasons: lack of plot, character development, and talent; misuse of Beatles songs, pretension...    And while I do consider myself a \\"true Beatles fan\\" (opposed to a fake one?) I have to say I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't love it either (and I really, really wanted to love it).     This movie does tend to play like a super long music video. It has little to no plot and is strung together by songs and Beatle references. Some of which are downright cringe- worthy, one in particular is when Prudence suddenly appears in Sadie's apartment and its revealed that \\"she came in through the bathroom window\\". Some of the songs featured have little to no significance to the movie. And the storyline left a lot to be desired, there was little explanation of the characters choices. It sometimes felt like I was just a bystander, with no insight into the characters but merely watching events unfold around them.    With only 19 years behind and without having studied the 1960s in depth, I am unable to commit on this movie's accurate portrayal of 1960s, but I thought they did an okay job conveying the tension, the change, and the drug and sex exploration of the time.      Furthermore, their rendition of the songs were not half bad. I mean, sure the Fab Four didn't intend for their songs to be taken so literally, but that's kind of what music is all about isn't? The fact that it means something different to everybody. Hands down the best thing about the film is its cinematography. It was nothing short of breathtaking and because of that I can watch this movie again.    Overall, I think the film is worth viewing. Beatles' fans should rent it before buying, because your either going to love it or hate it.    Highlights:  \\"I want to hold your hand\\" sung by T.V. Carpio  \\"Happiness is warm gun\\" sung by Joe Anderson  \\"Across the Universe\\" sung by Jim Strugress  \\"Blackbird\\" sung by Evan Rachael Wood    Are they better than the original? Um, not no, but hell no! Still, I found the previously mentioned songs to be the most enjoyable and download-worthy.    And with all its flaws, be thankful there wasn't a character named 'Strawberry Fields' ...
B0013J30W2|4.0|WANTED is loosely based on the comic mini-series by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones which has been published by Top Cow productions. The movie is directed by Timur Bekmambetov, the filmmaker who gave us the 2 part Russian mystical action series: \\"Nightwatch\\" and \\"Daywatch\\". I wasn't a fan of those two films so I went in without any expectations. Surprise! This director seemed to have honed his directorial skills; armed with a larger budget, a great cast and a comic series that has a cult following, \\"Wanted\\" is a visually stunning action movie that redefines the term \\"Popcorn Entertainment\\".<br /><br />Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) is an accountant in a dead end job, with a cheating girlfriend and who is flat broke. One day, he encounters a woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) who after an encounter with a man named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) takes him to see the head of a secret organization of assassins called \\"The Fraternity\\". Sloan (Morgan Freeman) has revealed that Gibson's father was a member and that they want him to follow his father's footsteps. Being his father's son, Wesley has a unique ability to pump more adrenaline into his body than a normal person can. Wesley undergoes extensive training both mental and physical to go face to face with the man who supposedly killed his father; Cross. Little does he know that there is more to everything than meets the eye and truths may lead him to question everything he has come to believe.<br /><br />\\"WANTED\\" is an adrenaline-pumping, fast-paced, soda-slurping, hyper-kinetic solid action film that relies on its visual execution. The way it is shot is directed at our visual senses with outlandish action sequences that is both sexy, dynamic and nearly as groundbreaking as the original \\"Matrix\\". This is definitely the film's main draw as the director immerses you into the sequences that looks enchanting, sexy and downright COOL. Once Bekmambetov sets things up, the audience will be treated to one of the most impressive action sequences I've been privy to less than 5 minutes into the film. It was a great move in part of the director, to wake the viewer up and make sure he has your attention for its entirety with a large exclamation point. The film is not pretentious--it knows exactly what it's aiming for.<br /><br />Now, there is also more to the film that first meets the eye. The film has an effective plotline. These highly trained assassins whose skills borders on being superhuman are not simple killers who get paid to do a job. They depend on mysticism in order to decide who lives and who dies. The tapestry has a close relationship to Norse Mythology's \\"Weave of FATE\\" According to which, the three Norns were responsible for weaving the future of man and Gods alike. Well, according to Norse Mythology anyway. Some viewers may argue that this may be a little far-fetched that there should always be someone to pull the strings; well, that's where the film also becomes a morality play. The film has bits of the \\"revenge\\" formula but it doesn't really hurt its proceedings.<br /><br />Wesley Gibson is a simple guy with no ambitions so how does one train him to awaken his hidden capabilities? Simple, first beat the tar out of him. I mean beating him ala-\\"Fight Club\\". This may be a step backward to some, but for me I thought it made sense. Some Zen techniques have proven that pain can be used as a tool to chip away the useless things. Adrenaline can be a magical thing, believe it or not. The filmmakers need to be complemented that they picked an actor like McAvoy instead of an ultra-cool personality like Jason Statham. McAvoy maintained that everyday guy image and I appreciated the fact that the screenwriter took the time to develop his character. Gibson is a pitiable character and I saw how he was molded into a highly skilled assassin which was very admirable. Gibson became a different person and he doesn't look like someone intimidating that would allow him to blend in.<br /><br />It is always good to have Morgan Freeman and having Angelina Jolie around doesn't hurt either. Freeman is his usual sympathetic self and Jolie is her usual mysteriously sexy self. Jolie's character \\"Fox\\" is a woman driven into the Fraternity for her own reasons. We saw glimpses of her past but it doesn't really explain much about her which maintains her aura of mystery.<br /><br />The film does have its faults and some viewers may say that it follows some \\"already\\" established formulas; while this may be true, the film does work. Hey, it sure helps when you add an army of lethal rats stoked on peanut butter and explosives. The \\"curving\\" of bullets theory may seem a bit over the top but hey snipers have been curving a bullet's trajectory when a target is hundreds of yards away. There are also some great bits that comes out of the comic book. The shooting the wings off the fly would satisfy comic book fans. There are nice bits of humor dispersed throughout the film but it abandons it soon enough when the proceedings become all business.<br /><br />\\"WANTED\\" is full of familial vengeance, epiphanies, explosions and rock-solid shoot-outs that borders on insanely cool but also utterly insane. There is an overload of nasty violence and mild gore that would be cause for praise. Shooting through a blown away jugular? Cool. Amid all the violence and comic book mayhem the film finds a soul and the effective twists makes \\"Wanted\\" a very rewarding experience.<br /><br />Just what happens when you become the one thing you fight against?<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed this show completely when it first ran on TV.  I assume that there was minimal advertising, and I have been told that it was slotted for Friday nights, not the best place to be.  After seeing \\"Serenity\\" (the movie made after the canceled show was off the air, I had to get as much of this show as possible.  It has the right mix of sci-fi, action, humor and even several love stories, all happening at once.  If you have any interest in this genre, you will get your money's worth; I have watched each episode several times.  The only negative is that there are only 14 episodes to watch.  Shame on Fox for canceling this show!   I pray that they will bring it back on air, but that is too naive to believe.  The big-shots can't admit such a big mistake.

B0018AK9RA|4.0|This Tap-worthy effort could have been an embarrassment for Priest, but they pulled it off. Concept albums are dangerous. (see The Elder, Kiss). There is enough Priest standard heaviosity to satisfy the long time Priest fan, and some new stuff to keep things interesting. I tend to be forgiving when my favorite groups experiment, and it is possible that I am overlooking flaws. But bottom line is, I enjoyed this album, silly as the concept is. Just like Tap,  Judas Priest continues to fill a much needed void.

B00003CXBK|4.0|I was a little unsure of what to expect from the title of this movie, but it certainly wasn't about a princess.  The plot of this film was very good.  I have yet to watch it with subtitles and I expect that it will be much better with them.  Billy Bob Thornton is terrible, plain and simple.  Minnie Driver seems out of place in her role as well.  Let's face it, the English voiceovers completely lack conviction.  At least some of the other anime films with English dubs that I have seen sound like they actually give a crap about what they are doing.  The main character, however was excellently voiced IMO.  As far as the plot goes, it is excellent.  You may want to read up on some Japanese tradition/legends before watching as most westerners brush off a plot about nature as hippie rubbish.  This film has a good message and should be embraced, with or without the crappy dubs.    The animation is top notch for the time period that it was released.  The opening scenes are some of my favorite and I am sure you'll see why.  All in all, the film is like a violent disney movie with an actual message that should be received by most kids 12 and older (unless you cottle your kids and could nag the paint off of the walls, in which case go and sit your kids down in front of Handy Manny or something while you wait for Sex and the City to come out on DVD (if you found that offensive, you know in your heart that it is true, so stop lying to yourself already!)).  I would not recommend this film to children that are any younger than this age due to the eerie violence that ensues at some unexpected parts.  Oh come on, just pay the 15 bucks and see it.  You probably won't regret it.  I didn't.
0060589469|5.0|My father read the book when he was 25 and said it changed his life. I read the book only last year, at 25 as well. It changed my life too, and my perceptions of it. It's a very brilliant piece of work, with such astute commentaries on society, philosophy, and yes, quality. Unfortunately, the title, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, is hard for people to get at first. One friend of mine even thought I was reading manual to learn how to fix motorcycles. But I don't know what else I'd call it.

0061148512|5.0|The Bell Jar was one of the most substantial things written by Sylvia Plath, who was world-renowned for being one of America's best poets. In college I took an array of poetry classes, I enjoyed them to an extent, and I always did well in them. But poetry has never really affected me like it has other people. A lot of it is pretentious, and a lot of it is hard to understand. But Plath eased in well to prose; it was excellent.     Initially this wasn't a big seller (partly due to her using the pseudonym \\"Victoria Lucas\\"), but after her very tragic suicide in 1963, the novel took on a new fame.    It's about a smart college girl in the 1950s; starts just after the Rosenbergs are electrocuted (as it states on page one). This young woman is spending a semester in New York City working for a reputable fashion magazine, as an intern, winning her spot with twelve others for academic excellence: for her it was writing a particular poem. The book follows her life for approximately a year; from New York to Massachusetts (Plath's originally from Boston). It's a \\"confessional-prose\\" masterpiece.
0394818237|5.0|This delightful book for children which is enjoyable for parents to read as well wonderfully teaches  us that we are all part of a family here to help each other with the gifts we have been given. For those with Faith, it is a happy way to show that we need each other, and to be grateful for each person, and appreciate what they do to make the world a better place;  that each person is, as Pope Benedict said, \\"loved, willed and necessary.\\"!
B00065MDSG|4.0|This album is a treasure mostly because the sound is unique to anything you will hear. No other artist will be able to imitate this sound, and even this very band, in any other lineup, couldn't imitate the sound. And it is definitely a cool sound.     This is a great album to introduce yourself to King Crimson. The sound is very accessible, but remaining extremely experimental and artistic.     The whole thing has a very dark and sinister tone to it, which definitely adds to the value of the music in my opinion.     The album definitely isn't for everyone, and may put you in a weird mood if you listen to it too many times, or for too long, but I cannot deny that this is a class album.     Also, don't judge the album solely by the samples that are provided on any website. :)     The songs change quite a bit throughout.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|As soon as I ripped open my \\"Where the Light Is\\" Live DVD I watched it all the way through.  John manages to capture the audience with new tweakings of his top songs.  The man continues to amaze me because he is his own worst critic and he is never satisfied, which ends up being a treat for anyone willing to be a fan for years.  This DVD contains numerous songs in which he expands and elaborates his vocals..top notch John, top notch.  Buy this- you won't be disappointed.
B00006AW2F|5.0|This album showcases some really good R&B and Motown influence from the stones, along with folk and pure gritty Rock n Roll.     It's a great sound. The songs are catchy, driving, and they have that edge that the stones give into all of their performances that just makes the whole thing raw and gritty.     The songs on this album are from the early era of the stones history, thus the atmosphere of it is very warm and original.     Great music. These songs will stay with me for a long time.
0679805273|5.0|I bought a bunch of these as graduation gifts for high school kids.  The book is yet another great Dr. Suess book and is a perfect book for any kind of grad (or just for a child to read too!).
B00008QSA5|5.0|Seems like a lot of the people who bought this album bought it mostly because of Mike Bloomfield's half of it.     And let me tell you, this is a great half. The instrumentation is nothing new, but the musicians play with this flare that is unique to this album. It's as if all of the players were discovering their amazing powers at music for the first time, all at once.     You can tell they were having a really great time. It shows through in the music.     Stephen Stills side is the less appreciated side of the album (though still appreciated). I'm just going to say that I am extremely glad that they decided to call in Stills to finish this album off, because I have fallen in love with his half.     The layed back, feelin cool, not a care in the world groove of \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\" is just ridiculously original. I don't think they could have done a better job on this song, no matter what.     It is a fresh song, with tons of replay value. It's like listening to Rock N Roll for the first time again.     Season of the Witch is another fantastic cover that Stephen and the band took home. It's a lengthy song, with great singing and jamming.     Bonus tracks are definitely worth checking out as well. The whole album is wonderful, and I'd be surprised if it were to let you down in your expectations.
0743290119|3.0|Then there is a good chance you'll like this one. It's pretty short compared to Devil and Everyone, and since we're talking about three different women, I didn't feel like we really got to know them as well.  But Weisberger's voice is evident throughout.  It was fun and easy to read, very predictable. I got the feeling that this book was hurriedly written though.  All in all, if you like her other books then you will probably enjoy this one.  I had great hopes for it and wasn't disappointed that I bought it, it just wasn't one of those \\"oh I'm bummed it's over, I want to read it over again right now\\" and her other two books are ones that I read front to back twice in a row, and have read them both again numerous times since the first reading.  This one will go on the shelf and probably be read again, maybe in a year or two.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|This movie is fantastic!  The screen writers followed the book as closely as possible.  There are a few minor changes but nothing that altered the storyline.  If you haven't read the books, read them because they will explain some of what you see in the movie and prepare you for future movies in the series.
B00110K62U|5.0|This performance does indeed have the dream cast.  The roles are played to perfection.  The bonus information is most interesting.  To think that the critics panned the original stage performance, although the public loved it. Les Mis is truely one of the greatest musicals ever composed. There is one disappointment, however.  The Tenth Anniversary Concert, as seen on PBS, included a special encore presenting actors who played Jean Valjean in productions from 17 different countries, each stepping up to sing a line, or two, of \\"Do You Here the People Sing\\" in his own language.  This encore was omitted from the DVD, although it was included on the CD of this concert.  I can see this encore only on my own VCR of the concert. Too bad.
0684857219|5.0|This is really a very good book. 800 pages will keep you occupied for a while. Lots of history, personal stories from Arnold and lots and lots of pictures from back in the day to recent times. Definitely worth buying.
B00150B2SS|4.0|[[ASIN:B000GP1P94 TINKER, TAYLOR, SOLDIER, SPY]]  This one of le Carre's best stories, quite dark but very well written. The times it describes (the 70s) are history of a different age, when Europeans in particular lived under what seemed a very real nuclear threat from the Soviets and their satellite countries. One is left with a sense of thankfulness that terrorists are pretty much the only threat we need worry about today.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Wesley Gibson is a guy with a bit of a problem.  He's a big fat zero.  He's got a crappy job, a fat evil beeyotch of a boss, a cheating girlfriend and a two-timing best friend.  In fact, change a vowel and this guy's name would be Wussley.  It totally fits  him.  Poor Wesley is so at a loss to find an identity that he googles his own name and almost falls apart when nothing turns up.<br /><br />So one dark dreary night, Wesley ambles into a convenience store.  Typical of Wesley to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Fate or coincidence?  Next thing Wesley knows, he's being shot at by a robot-like assassin named Cross and rescued by a drop-dead-gorgeous woman named Fox.  The resulting car chase is a doozy.  Fox takes Wesley to a decripit old factory on the edge of town which turns out to be the headquarters of the Fraternity, a thousand-year-old society of weavers who have gone down the centuries taking out bad guys and making the world a better place.  Fox introduces Wesley to Sloan, the head of the Fraternity, who tells Wesley that Cross is a renegade member of the group who murdered Wesley's father.  If Wesley passes the initiation test and makes it into the Fraternity, he'll have an opportunity to revenge his father's death by taking out Cross.  The initiation is a no-holds-barred beat-down that would turn Hulk Hogan into a quivering wreck, but Wesley toughs it out and becomes a Fraternity member.  All is well...<br /><br />... or is it?  Something in this Fraternity doesn't smell right, and it doesn't take Wesley long to find out what.  The resulting denouement includes train wrecks, bombs blowing up, bullets shooting around in circles (did I mention this is an action movie?), exploding heads; Timur Bekmambetov didn't miss a trick in this film.  He piles special effect on special effect until we think our heads are going to explode as well, but somehow it all works.  Don't try to deconstruct this film to find out how it works, because that won't work.  In fact, it's best enjoyed by just putting your brains on hold and watching the fun.<br /><br />A few words on the acting.  Although James McAvoy is endearingly wimpy as Wimpy-Wesley, he doesn't quite make the total transition to Wonder-Wesley.  Morgan Freeman is chillingly effective as Sloan, the head of the Fraternity, and the supporting actors all give competent performances.  But the one who dominates the screen in every scene she's in is, of course, Angelina Jolie.  We've heard so much over the past few years about Angelina-the-humanitarian, Angelina-the-supermom, Angelina-the-other-half-of-Brangelina, etc., that it almost brings you up short when you watch her act and remember that Jolie is an actress, and a damn good one.  She totally throws herself into this movie.  A magazine feature on the film said that it was Jolie's idea to keep her lines to a minimum to make her character more scary and menacing, but Jolie doesn't need a lot of dialogue in this movie; she conveys more with her eyes than most actors could express in ten lines of script.  She's one of the main reasons to watch this film; the other, of course, is the bam-boom-in-your-face action that never lets up.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a movie that will make you think, or introspect, or challenge you in any way, go watch something else because this ain't it.  But if you want a movie that's pure edge-of-your-seat fun and excitement, \\"Wanted\\" delivers in spades.  Kick back, pass the nachos, and enjoy an hour and fifty minutes of pure slam-bang pandemonium.<br /><br />Judy Lindenjoyed by just putting your brains on hold and watching the fun.

6305882592|5.0|Hal Ashby's masterpiece Harold and Maude is so many people's favourite movie, that it's mind-boggling. When the film was released in 1971 it was panned by the bulk of the reviewers and was thought of as something that would be quickly forgotten as it was not easy for the Academic journalists to pigeonhole. Both, Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon won Golden Globes for best Actress and Best Actor that year even though the press had been grossly unkind. Several American theatres even played this film repetitively for two years, day after day, just because it was that good.<br /><br />The screenplay for Harold and Maude was an idea that was spawned for Collin Higgin's thesis for the UCLA screenwriting MFA program and the film took off from there. [[ASIN:0380003856 The book]] is also available, for those interested, but be advised the book was put together after the film and reads a bit dry, and doesn't tell an expanded story as one would think it would, but rather a slightly `different story', if you will. But don't get me wrong, the book is still very entertaining and a good read.<br /><br />The film is about a struggle between the value of life and a young man named Harold Chasen and the mentoring brought by his new friend Maude. Not until he meets and forms a bond with Maude does he start to understand that the world, and himself isn't on the verge of an apocalypse as he might have been led to believe by his self-indulgent and caddish mother, wonderfully imagined and portrayed by Vivian Pickles. Don't you just love that accent, and her random French phrasing?<br /><br />Harold obviously was meant to be portrayed as someone suffering, as we see multiple attempts at suicide, which is a large part of his verbal and physical vocabulary. He has either an absent or dead father which is a theme that is not addressed but does make the viewer wonder how much it plays upon his psyche. The real story is the grand coupe of how Maude wins him over, getting him to really embrace and appreciate life, which is incredibly touching, making this movie one of the most unforgettable films of all time. The score, woven in beautifully by Cat Stevens, heightens the importance and greatness of the film, which continually pull at the heart-strings and the mind.<br /><br />Some people, smirk and pull away if they've heard about this film, but haven't seen it. They always say: \\"Oh, that film. Not interested.\\" I've met about a handful of these types and they're typically bothered by Harold and Maude's relationship. Yawwwnnnnn. Others say they're always bothered by the suicide aspect, let me tell you that the thought of suicide has got me through many a dark night, and I don't find it offensive or inappropriate in the slightest. All I can say is do yourself a favor and watch it from beginning to end, uninterrupted and just accept it for what it is. Just because an element of a film bothers you -- doesn't mean that the film is bad, it just means that the film stirred an uncomfortable emotion in you. That's all.<br /><br />It would be nice to see this film get the re-master and frame-by-frame cleaning and color correction treatment. The DVD quality looks like a really good video transfer, but a video transfer nonetheless. It's presented in 5.1 Dolby surround, which is a plus, but this film really begs a commentary, extras, stills, all of that which is common on other releases.<br /><br />And yes, for the record ... this is in my top three favourite all-time films. Magnificent.credibly touching, making this movie one of the most unforgettable films of all time.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|Kiss took a huge chance in 1981 with a concept album and it nearly ended the band.  (Their only album not to go gold or platimun). Judas Priest has now released a double disc concept album very late in their career and I see this as their lowest point of their career. (Even lower than Ripper Owens).  I am a huge Priest fan.  I own every album but let's be honest the guitar work on this album is barely there and the keyboards remind me of the mid 80's.  The symphonic sound is great if you're Nightwish, but to not have your album sound like a Priest album is wrong and misleading to true Priest fans.  You can have a concept themed album with all the bells and stuff and keep it a true rock album.  A change in a band's sound usually means one of two things - One - they are changing with the times or - Two - too many different creative controls from within the band or its producers, like Metallica's St. Anger.  Hardcore Priest fans will probably love or like the album, mainly because their loyal.  Hardcore music fans will probably think that this album is crap.  I thought the album was so bad that I'm passing on this year's tour.  Honestly folks, they haven't done a great album since Painkiller.  I hope that they can bounce back like KISS did but this late in their career I don't think they will.
0679805273|5.0|This wonderful Dr. Seuss book is our favorite gift for graduates from High School.  It is simple in its language, but very thoughtful in its message.  It discusses successes as well as bumps in the road, which is a true picture of life.  It is encouraging, and fun, the artwork is delightful.  Read it from cover to cover, enjoy it, and think.

0142410373|5.0|At the time of this review, there has been a paltry 3, yes three, a mere trio, of reviews on Matilda. How? Is this not deservingly one of the all-time classics? Crazy stuff. For my money, I'm pinning this odd occurrence on global warming. Anyway...the book! If you read the opening page, you're in. How can anyone resist that stuff about parents thinking their truly hideous children are so gorgeous and gifted? And it's all good from there on out. C'mon, Trunchbull is hilarious with her quick talking, exclamation point-driven dialogue and barbarian attitude toward everyone. And that little Matilda... The book does differ somewhat from the movie, so even if you've seen the flick, the book is still a great time.      As an aside, and to anyone considering a career in writing, I understand that Roald's first draft had Matilda being kind of bratty and evilish in the first half of the first draft. Roald's editor (maybe agent) told Roald to rewrite it to make Matilda sweeter, or at least more understandably evil, in the book's first 100 pages or so. As this was Roald's final book, I believe, this fact is heartening to any would-be writer--a skilled veteran like Dahl still making errors! It gives us all hope. Further, and only when you know the above info, when you read Matilda, you can almost see where Roald went to the trouble of rationalizing Matilda's somewhat dastardly actions toward her parents. Fascinating!
B000WGWQG8|2.0|The story of John Adams is a very important part of our heritage as a nation. If you really want to understand this man and this period in our American history you have to read the biography by David McCullough. The HBO series is entertaining but does not capture the essence of 1776 America or the details which John Adams captured in his writings which are featured in the book. I am amazed at the number of people who falsely believe this miniseries serves as a lesson in history. Don't allow your intelligence to be dulled by the director of this film.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|As others have said, this film is pitiful in most respects. I watched it on a recent flight just to see how Scarlett Johanson and Natalie Portman would work in their respective roles, because they both seemed cast because they had the right hair color. Scarlett has the 'sex bomb' persona, Natalie always seems so much colder.     In the end, Scarlett's portrayal of Mary touched me, though historically it cannot be anywhere near the truth. Mary would never have been allowed near the king before Anne's execution (the whole family were fleeing in every direction imaginable to prevent them from being caught up in the king's anger), there's no evidence the king gave her a promise for Anne's life, etc etc.    A final thought: a number of reviewers mention how willing the Boleyn/Howard family was to sacrifice the two sisters. In fact, all three siblings (brother George included) were sacrificed. He, too, was executed - for supposed incest with Anne. Mary is the only one who survives the fiasco, to live a quiet and happy life with second husband Stafford.     Whatever. I liked it more than I thought I would.
B0016AJU2C|2.0|Preface:  I'm not an Alanis Morissette fan-boy, but I've always appreciated her alternative songwriting and the very open nature of her lyrics.  She's always done a great job telling the story of her own internal struggles with the various challenges of life -- friends, family, other people, her own place in the world, etc.  Every new Alanis album has been another layer of insight into her own life's exploration.    Knowing that every album has to grow on you, even from your favorite artists, I gave it several listens across different days (different moods, to be fair).  Truly, this album is pretty bad.  It has one or two likeable tracks, a few interesting hooks, and gives due credit to her still-awesome vocal abilities.  But unless you like emo bands and the kiddie pop that seems to be popular right now, skip it.  I say that with all due respect to a great artist, but really, save your money.  I can't even suggest 'borrowing' the MP3s from somewhere to give it a try -- it's that far removed from anything else she's done, and so close to the emo band poop that's on the radio right now, you will just end up questioning your own judgment.    Nutshell:  If you like current emo-band pop radio drivel, you'll probably like this -- a lot.  If you liked prior Alanis albums -- even mostly -- you will probably really not like this.
0763621803|4.0|Charlie has to look after his little sister and give her dinner. Unfortunately, Lola is a very picky eater, and we have to sit through the entire list of things she won't eat. ESPECIALLY not tomatoes.    So he decides to \\"play a good trick on her\\" and tell her that all these foods she \\"won't eat\\" are really *different* and exotic foods that she's sure to love. (Are you sure you don't want these green drops? I'll eat them, then, they're very rare!)    Predictably (to us grown-ups), she gobbles all these foods up, and then turns the table on her brother by asking for the tomatoes (These? Are you sure you want THESE?) declaring that they're \\"moonsquirters\\" and saying \\"You didn't think they were tomatoes, did you Charlie?\\"    What's interesting is that this technique is actually recommended for both child and adult picky eaters. Oh, not the trickery, but the use of pleasant sounding names to make foods sound appealing. (And really, Lola wasn't tricked at all, was she?)
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly has a dry, sarcastic humour that appeals.  The crew of 'bad' guys do whats right more often than not. i think the only reason they are bad guys is because to be law abiding citizens would have too many rules and checkpoints.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|The most delightful movie I've seen all year and one of the best movies as well.  It was such a romantic story, and perfect for the whole family.  Pixar and Disney don't disappoint, and I think WALL-E tops Finding Nemo as my favorite of the lot.  Definitely a must-see!

This cd is out of this world kickass good.  I am shocked that there are actually low reviews on this cd, but everyone has their own opinion I guess. But this is mine, and this cd is worth buying and you will not regret it one bit. It sounds like system of down, only it is different, and I dont know how to explain it. It is very political and just mind blowing. I love this cd so much, and this will always be a cd I will adore.  BUY IT:D If you are a fan of system of a down, then there is no reason why you shouldnt have this cd.
B000JMK6LC|4.0|After the financial and critical disaster of \\"Alexander\\", Oliver Stone was called upon to direct this intimate story of the effect of 9/11 on two firefighters.  Using considerable restraint and an non-exploitative approach, Stone explores the trauma and the tensions involved in rescuing these 2 heroic firefighters and the effects it had on their families.  By personalizing this story, Stone has not trivalized this important story but has created a tribute to these two men and a memorial to those who died risking their lives in this tragedy.

How good is it, you ask? If I was stranded on a desert island and I could only take 5 of my all time favorite reads with me....Killing Joke would be one of them.  Let me try to review without spoiling anything for those of you that may have never read this gem...and believe me it's been around for years!<br /><br />  First off the scribe of Alan Moore is nothing short of incredible to intense to at times insane.  Mr. Moore can bring up feelings in his readers that make you want to turn you head to advert your eyes....but alas you can't and you won't....like a rubber necker driving past a car wreck you are doomed to stare all slacked jawed as you slowly roll by.  That is the Killing Joke....Alan Moore at his best....teamed up with Brian Bolland (best known for his Judge Dredd vs. Judge Death in 2000AD comics) at his best.  Brian has the spectacular talent to feed your eyes these unbelievable images and leave you wanting more.  Even when they are ugly...haunting images....you still can see the beauty of his work.<br />So one of the best Batman Stories?? Without a doubt.  Should you own it??? God yes!  5 out of 5 Stars....I would have given it 10!<br /><br />Thanks for reading!
B00186DV1U|4.0|Clint Eastwood came out of a creative slump in the '90s when he won Oscars for \\"The Unforgiven\\" and followed it up with this intriguing thriller directed by Wolfgang Petersen. Clint plays a veteran Secret Service agent who latches on to a plot involving the assasination of the President by discovering the identity of the assasin (John Malkovich). Malkovich is in game form here and he meshes well with Eastwood in their cat and mouse exchanges (some really great dialogue, rare in movies today, is employed here). Eastwood, while not a great actor, is in fine form here and the scene between him & Rene Russo in the Presidential suite with him reminscing about that fateful day in '63 is Clint at his best, acting-wise.  Malkovich, of course, walked off with an Oscar nod for his role as an disenchanted government assasin and the supporting roles are filled nicely by Dylan McDermott as Clint's ill-fated partner, John Mahoney as a good friend, Gary Cole as a by the book agent and Fred Dalton Thompson as the President's press secretary.  So if you're an Eastwood fan and love thrillers, do check this one out (I may purchase this on blu-ray as well).
B00138Z97C|5.0|I gave this collection 5 stars because of the beauty of Montserrat Caballé's voice.  As all her fans will agree, she is incredible!  However, buyers should be aware that the literature accompanying this set is very limited.  Although the cardboard CD slipcases are reproductions of the original LP album jackets, due to the much smaller size most of the text on the back of each is practically illegible.  There is also a 64 page booklet which gives a brief account of Caballé's career, reproduces some of the text from the album covers at a readable size, and includes a few B&W photos of the Diva.  I was extremely disappointed to find none of the texts included with this set.  This is especially annoying since each of the reproduced album covers specifically says that texts and translations are included (as they undoubtedly were in the originals).  I do not agree with the previous reviewer that this collection is being issued at a bargain price.  At this price, Sony should have provided the texts.  At minimum, they could have made them available on their website.  Granted, libretti of the more popular works are easily available, but when was the last time anyone saw the libretto of Donizetti's Maria de Rohan?
0061245097|3.0|I prefer Urban Fantasy to Supernatural Romance, and I knew going into this series that it was SR.  (Frankly the covers drew me in, and the jacket promised enough kick-buttery that I felt I could probably overlook the romance angle).  I felt the first book was quite entertaining, but this one never quite connected with me.    I'm not entirely sure why that was, but here, I think are some factors:    a) New facts about the supernatural world revealed when they make for convienient plot twists.  I'm thinking of two items in particular, which I'm not convinced the author had thought of during her pre-series \\"world-building\\".    b) The heroine's \\"job\\" never felt right to me.  I've worked with (though not for) an number of government agencies, and \\"freewheeling\\" is not a term that pops into mind when I want to describe the process.  The heroine gets to call her own shots with no oversight or paperwork way too often to be credible.    c) Too much \\"wish  fulfillment\\".  For instance, the fate of the cad who deflowered the heroine in book one comes to mind.  Yes he was a cad, but he didn't rape her, and the continuous dishing out of punishment to him just seems spiteful and over the top.    d) Too few consequences.  I'm thinking particularly here of a scene near the end of the book, which devalues an earlier scene.    On the plus side, the sex level is amped up from book one, there is some good humor (the two actually cross when the heroine decides a screaming orgasm is the best revenge..) and the government seems to be getting some idea about \\"good vampires\\" and \\"bad vampires\\".
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is a landmark anime film directed by Hayao Miyazaki.  The film is based off of a manga by the same name that was made by Miyazaki.<br /><br />The film takes place one thousand years after the \\"Seven Days of Fire.\\"  This catastrophe destroyed human civilization and most of Earth's original ecosystem.  A few scattered human settlements survive, but they are isolated from each other by the Sea of Decay (a lethally toxic jungle of fungus that is swarming with giant insects).<br /><br />Nausicaa is the princess of the Valley of the Wind, and she possesses an unusual gift for communicating with the giant insects in the Sea of Decay (where she will go, while wearing a mask, to conduct scientific research).  The valley is threatened when another state unearths a God Warrior embryo; the God Warriors were one of the giant, biological weapons used in the ancient war.  The embryo is stolen by another state, and this state's ship crashes into the valley while transporting the embryo.  The people of the valley are forced into armed resistance, and Nausicaa must find a way to bring a resolution to the situation.<br /><br />This DVD release contains two DVDs.  The second DVD just includes the storyboard version of the film.  The first disc contains three extras: a \\"Behind the Microhpone\\" documentary (interviews with the English dub cast), a documentary entitled \\"The Birth of Studio Ghibli,\\" and the original theatrical and TV trailers for Nausicaa.  The documentary was very informative, but I was disappointed that Disney decided to overdub English over the Japanese audio, instead of leaving the Japanese audio and putting subtitles on the screen.<br /><br />The film is wonderfully done, and utilizes its environmental undertones well.  The writing, storytelling, lush animation, and music combine together to make this film a masterpiece.
B0019GOT2Y|4.0|*\\"Devour.\\" Fast, high-tempo, with pretty good lyrics and melody.  Gets a little repetitive, though.<br />*\\"The Sound of Madness.\\" A moderate song with great percussion and guitar, but a weaker melody.<br />*\\"Second Chances.\\" A slower song than the previous ones, but still has a good tempo, percussion, and some good powerful vocals.<br />*\\"Cry for Help.\\" Faster song with awesome guitars, percussion, and lyrics.<br />*\\"The Crow and the Butterfly.\\" Slower, with strong chorus.<br />*\\"If You Only Knew.\\" This seems like a typical, upbeat rock song.  It has good vocals, but seems watered-down.<br />*\\"Sin With a Grin.\\" Much stronger with great guitars, percussion, and awesome lyrics and melody.<br />*\\"What a Shame.\\" A hefty downbeat song; sounds good.<br />*\\"Cyanide Sweet Tooth Suicide.\\" High-tempo hard rock; pretty darn awesome!<br />*\\"Breaking Inside.\\" Another softer song, with strong guitar.  Pretty good.<br />*\\"Call Me.\\" No, this is not a cover of Blondie.  This is a soft piano song with rock lyrics.  Pretty good, sentimental end for the album.<br /><br />If you have the \\"Fan Club Edition,\\" you get the following bonus tracks:<br /><br />*\\"I Own You.\\" Very good hard rock song; awesome guitars, percussion, and vocals.<br />*\\"The Energy.\\" Another good heavy track; good lyrics and melody.<br />*\\"Son of Sam.\\" High-tempo song with good guitars and great, wicked lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, this album is pretty good (and contains some awesome bonus tracks, if you get the \\"Fan Club Edition\\").  It has a few good strong metal songs and a few good ballads.  Some songs are a little blander, especially when compared to Shinedown's last album (\\"Us and Them,\\" which I still like the best), but is better than their first (\\"Leave a Whisper\\").  I could certainly get used to this album.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I love this cd!  The 90's was a great time for \\"alternative\\", \\"indie\\", rock or however you'd classify the Pumpkins (I hate the term \\"grunge\\").  The tracks all rock with heavy drums and guitar but you can still play it when you're just hanging out.  Billy Corgan's vocals go perfectly with every track.   \\"Today\\", \\"Cherub Rock\\", and \\"Hummer\\" are my absolute favorites on this cd if I had to narrow it down.  Great memories!
0307237702|5.0|Loved the book. Love the man. Love the fact that he's going to be our next President.  I'm going to read his other book next!
0385340567|1.0|I'm done with Child.  I loved his books.  Write a biography for your political beliefs but don't sneak them into your fiction series.  I read to be entertained.  I hear enough of this junk daily specially in a presidential race year.  I was lucky, picked this up at the library.  I seriously feel terrible for all that spent good earned money on this book.  I loved all and I mean I have read all of his books.  No more!!!!  I don't like to be tricked into reading a personal opinion of any author who writes fiction and uses his series to voice his personal beliefs.  Media, Hollywood, and now a favorite author (of course no longer).  So very disappointed. I feel like I lost a friend in Jack. Last book I will read of Child for me.
B000654YS8|5.0|I bought this dvd for my husband, who is a huge fan of Dire Straits. I also like the band. The way they put together clips from live concerts, along with music videos (when music videos were actually interesting) was very well done. A great trip down memory lane for any \\"baby boomer\\"!
B000CPGZHA|5.0|I actually purchased the Showgirl tour in the White Diamond set...Wonderful as is if Kylie would not be!!!! Althought the original has a certain flare to it that I found very enticing. Highly recommend. I just wish we had more access to Kylie things here in the US....
B00005JKJA|5.0|When Mulholland Drive first starts, you may think that Lynch is making a pretty normal movie. His style is pretty much the same but the plotline is managing to remain pretty linear (for a mystery film). Slowly, but surely, we begin to slip down the rabbit hole, and things get strange. The performances are great, especially Naomi Watts. This is one of those movies where it keeps getting better scene after scene, and you have to see it again and again. What truly makes this movie great is the numerous interpretations that can be realized viewing after viewing, and the fact that Lynch is such a master, none of your interpretations can be discounted. Go see this movie. Go buy this movie. This is a definate must have.
0316113506|5.0|Run, don't walk, to get this book. This should be required reading for every Doctor and School Teacher. This book will help me preserve many years of cognitive ability that I was surely destined to lose before I read it and started following Dr. Ratey's recommendations.    I found this book easy to read, extremely informative and highly motivating. The few places where I seemed to get bogged down in the science were quickly replaced by huge chunks of information that really inspired me to do the simplest of things that will protect and improve my mental stability. The information in this book really is a \\"no brainer!\\"    Buy it. Read it. Do it and you will be far ahead of almost anyone else in strengthening and preserving your mental health for the rest of your life!     To die is inevitable. However, I think this, along with legitimate brain training like \\"The Brain Fitness Program Software\\" that I just bought ($395 from PositScience) is a huge part of the key to avoiding dementia and Alzheimer's so that my brain isn't useless before my body wears out.
0143038419|4.0|I think a lot of the people who have left poor reviews for this book have been a little harsh.   I read this book as a recommendation and I have to say I really enjoyed it. If you are looking for a yoga-how-to, or a deep philosophical spiritual journey with literary prose, then you are looking at the wrong book. However, if you pick up the book as a good summer read (as I did) and take away from it the easy humor the authors voice emulates I have no doubt you will enjoy it.  It is not as religious as it seems it is going to be in the beginning either, which again, was a good thing for me.  All in all, I think you have to look at why you are reading this book before you judge it. I found it cute and entertaining.  I will read this author again.
0060558121|5.0|Seeking something a little lighter than my usual fare, and simply wanting a fun summer distraction, _American Gods_ was enthusiastically recommended to me by a friend, telling me this was just what I was looking for.  He was right.<br /><br />The story is an easy one for close readers to quickly pick up on - Gaiman gives plenty of hints about \\"mysterious\\" characters to reward the attentive; I was immeadiately drawn in.  Those not familiar with the character names and plays on names may feel a bit left out of the joke; fear not, the story is rewarding in its own right.<br /><br />Without giving away much (did I mention the story is fun and rewarding?), the hero, Shadow, is hired by a mysterious man to help him recruit equally mysterious men and women from around the country in anticipation of a major showdown.  Figuring out who these people are, where they came from and how the showdown will play out had me blazing through the book.  The fun and rewarding part?  Watching the plot and character's true identities slowly revealed, and (along with Shadow) trying to figure out what the importance of the showdown is, and how the heck he will get out of it.  For those with more serious (or \\"literary\\") tastes, there is much to like here as well:  think James Frazer meets Margaret Mead, with a healthy dose of action.<br /><br />Gaiman is a master storyteller, as this book certainly demonstrates.  Its a fun summer read.  Highly recommended.

B00005A46U|5.0|For years i've known about the band CARAVAN, but only the IN THE LAND OF PINK AND GREY album.  Last year, i got that PINK AND GREY album, and thought it was pretty good. Yet, i wasnt THAT impressed with it. I did like a lot of the songs, but the way some of composistions sounded, lead me to believe that the band didnt have a lot of strength creating consistantly interresting songs. However, since that time, i've become much more conversant with the \\"CANTERBURY\\" sound, like Soft Machine, Ayer's and Wyatt's solo work, Hatfield and the North, Gentle Giant, Camel, etc. Since so many of these band's EARLY albums (1969-1972 or so) were really good, I thought that MAYBE the album CARAVAN put out before PINK AND GREY might be worth hearing. I gave the band a second chance, and BOY, am i glad I did. It's seldom i will play the same music night after night. Yet, with IF I COULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN is one of those albums, where you can easily get addicted to the sound experience.  If you enjoy a Psychedelic lilt to your music, then this is definately the Caravan album to begin the exploration of their sound. There are some long songs, like little sonatas, on the first and second side, that have lovely dense texture. I believe that the keyboard player overdubbed his parts, with a guest artist providing very jazzy sax and flute melodies. Their lead guitar player also gives a lot of punch, and other nice touches, to the mix. This classic \\"ART ROCK\\" instrumentation sound, provides plenty of  simultaneous melodic movement, that stands out beautifully over the rythym section. I hear this especially during the series of songs \\"And I wish I were Stoned\\" into \\"As I feel I Die\\" into \\"EAR to the Ground\\". The sound is so dense, as to be nearly impossible to absorb every note you hear. One can tell, just by looking at the titles of the songs, that psychedelia is the name of their game. (Themes like \\"getting stoned, ego death, absorbing sounds beyond normal mortal hearing\\", etc.) The rest of the album is also very far out, including the bonus tracks that are included on newer editions of the CD.  So, for consistancy, sophistication of psychedelic experimentation, music depth and density, and surreal lyrics, this album ought to be classified among the VERY best of the Canterbury group . (Its right there with early GONG, the first 3 SOFT MACHINE albums, and the first GENTLE GIANT albums).  Caravan still has the humor and sonic non-seclures, common to this Canterbury sound.  Altho definately  psychedelic, IF I COULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN isnt quite as crazy, and sound effect laden, as the bizarre experimentation found on the first two SOFT MACHINES, and earliest GONG albums. All in all, Caravan struck a nice balance here. For my taste, this is CARAVAN's peak album.of the album is also very far out, including the bonus tracks that are included on newer editions of the CD.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|I was sort of hoping, since  they made us wait nearly a year to release the DVD, that there would be some cool extras. The only thing on there of note is the \\"making of Mad Men\\" - c'mon. I love this show - couldn't you be a bit more creative - maybe interviews with the actors, stock footage of 1960s era original advertising, easter eggs, blooper reel, screen tests - all the other goodies you expect to get in addition to the episodes.   This shouldn't be construed as a knock at the show itself - which is picture perfect - but if you are going to sit on a DVD release for 10 months at least make it worth the wait. I expect more from Season 2 DVD box Lionsgate / Weiner.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Best CD ever, love every track in it, from \\"Life in Technicolor\\" to \\" Lost\\" or \\"Viva la Vida\\".

B000FGGE5Y|5.0|This movie is actually much better than I expected it to be. Milla shows emotional range in her role and the supporting cast is surprisingly good as well. Basically, Ultraviolet is an action packed thriller with explosions and martial arts. Also, Milla looks very good in her outfits that seem to change color with her hair.   This is a five star product-
B00000J6AG|4.0|Just bought this CD a couple of weeks ago. I enjoyed listening to it because there's something different about these music compared to contemporary ones. Although obviously they are very modern, you can say Moby's technique of utilizing notes harks back to medieval times. The prolongation of some notes (which are hypnotizing) resembles those of the chants used in religious services. The transitions can be compared to majority of the classical/baroque music. And who could miss the vocals that resemble arias?
B000EOTAM6|5.0|Superb special effects with Charlize Theron! An action packed futuristic thriller not to be missed. By the way, Charlize looks good in her outfits  which earns this movie an extra star!   This is a five star movie!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was introduced to Firefly, the series, by friends at work. I mentioned that I liked the movie \\"Serenity\\", and they asked me how I liked the Firefly series. I had no clue there was a TV series called Firefly. So I bought the series and loved every episode as well as rewatched the movie, which has all the original TV series regular actors plus some new ones. For TNG, DS9, or VOY fans, I would highly recommend Firefly. It's a nice contrast from the Star Trek realm. But be prepared, the last episode leaves you hanging with LOTS of unanswered questions about the Serenity Crew that even the movie doesn't answer. It truly is an incomplete story line that I hope Joss Whedon finishes.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Excellent CD! All of the songs are unique and well written. The new singer is a wise choice to replace the very high vocals of the original singer. In fact, I prefer the new vocalist who I can actually understand. The original singer hit notes that were too high. I could not understand what she was singing about because she sang too high.   The new Nightwish is far better than the old. I rate this a five star product-

0618918248|5.0|As a former Catholic Christian fundamentalist, Richard Dawkins book has aided me immensely in removing the \\"immoveable, unchangeable\\" blocks to reason and truth.  Especially helpful are the sections treating \\"natural selection\\".  I could see the light as I gradually floated upward toward the oxygen I needed to recover from  the abuse I suffered about eternal damnation, fear, and \\"suffering is good\\".  Regardless of the outcome, I can encourage others who have suffered the same, to let his book speak to you. \\"the truth shall make you free\\".

Thank you for this introspective and sublime music--let this set a precedent for a decaying recording industry that focuses too much on image and not enough on quality or substance in art.  Art should touch human beings on a much deeper, often inexplicable, yet intuitive level.

0143038419|1.0|Don't even waste your time. I can count on one hand the number of books that disgusted me so much I couldn't finish them and this was one of them. The whining is unreal for someone with no real responsibility in life. The author is very melodramtic. This woman needs real problems and has WAY too much time on her hands. I really wanted to slap the selfishness out of her. Awful, awful book.
B00005JPY0|4.0|(4.5 stars) After a view to a horrible hard-to-watch VCD download, i conquered the discomfort to provide you guys my opinion in viewing experience only. Sorry i can't give you further analysis on the screen effects. First an introduction for newcomers, then \\"The dark knight\\", ok?<br /><br />- Introduction for newcomers:<br /><br />Since Tim Burton took one of the most famed superhero sagas and masterfully portrayed the nocturnal atmosphere in a well-balanced comic book transcription to cinema back in 1989, his stunning and stylised vision and concept including the bleak and soaring urban waystelands, and the somber super-human vigilante dressed in the best accomplished design for the legendary bat-suit till date, degenerated in Joel Schumacher's colorful, fanciful toy-store fantasy, a desperate all-senses barrage of cheap stimulations that no serious fan could bear. Since dignity was not an issue for that last lame effort that destroyed the audiences's interest in the saga raised with love and effort by Mr. Burton, Schumacher's annoying mass-oriented disaster did ended the industry's attention in the continuity of the diffuse and declining Batman series. And nobody complained about it, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan's cerebral style, full of intensity and focus towards the psychology of his tormented and demented characters, didn't seemed like an expected choice for the directing of the awaited return of the dark cape crusader to theaters in 2005. His previous masterpiece \\"Memento\\", a gem of intellectual originality, showed him in a whole different filmic category, for some a higher level away from comic book paraphernalia. However the results were astonishing: As a true visionary, Nolan didn't continue neither improved the previous crippled franchise, but resurrected and  reintroduced with stunning originality and talent, the legacy of Batman unto audiences again. Though the new design was a little bit jarring, Nolan and writer David Goyer turned their backs to Burton's more compact, comfortable direct transcription and created a melancholic dark universe ruled by an angry mean millionaire crimefighter, played to perfection by gifted actor Christian Bale. The detailed, dramatic but interesting evolution of the classic character portrayed on \\"Batman begins\\" along with the incredible imaginative script and full action sequences, ranks among the most compelling scenes ever filmed for this sub-genre, giving to DC comics the worthy outing to compete with the  more effective Marvel adaptations on screen.<br /><br />- The Dark Knight review (no spoilers):<br /><br />This sequel of the solid previous outing, is by all means the consolidation of Nolan's new, better, more in-depth portrayal of the legend and graphic myth of Batman. Glorious in its perfect detailed approach of the new dark paralel universe named Gotham City, outstanding in the search for strong emotions trought the focus on the double life and inner struggle of the haunted-by-the-past superhero, relentless in the conceptualization of violence and demented fear inflicted by the new and more psychotic than ever Joker, who turns out to be the closest more effective representation of the character's true essence: the macabre contradiction between goofy circus-humor and pure evil homicidal schizophrenia. A true sociopathic sense of humor about loving mayhem.<br /><br />Nolan's design concepts continue to provoque the classic fans, going against the old adopted previous stereotypes. Costume design moved forward, but Heath Ledger's goulishly and gleeful makeup style annoyed more than one. But the truth is that Batman's nemesis is in top form, inspired, stronger and more disturbingly sinister than any other known representation, including Mr Nicholson's over the top performance. The scar-faced epileptic buffoon lives outside the Joker costume, wearing his make-up as a battle flag, declaring his inner insane purposes as values of life: Total Chaos.<br /><br />It's proven that changing actors for the same role is not recommended, but Maggie Gyllenhaal taking over Rachel Dawes's  character from Katie Holmes was almost a good idea. The introduction of district attorney Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart) was an unexpected benefit for the whole plot, bringing coherency and dramatic sense of irony to the development of the movie.<br /><br />The story is not extremely complicated but full of interesting twists among the obvious advance to the final comfrontation, the battle between good and evil, with a catastrophic scenario of Gotham city turned into a battlefield of raging gangs and maniacal criminals. The performances of Christian Bale (the disguise and fake voice tend to cancel his great effort) and Gary Oldman are Amazing as usual, and the action is restless, when the tireless war against the hordes of  violent antisocials turn the streets of Gotham City into complete chaos. This movie fills the expectations in every possible way, giving the viewer a complete, gritty and astonishing ride into the phenomenal world of the Dark Knight and his quest for order and vengeance. And let's not forget the amazing grandiose music score, covering every important scene with a sonic layer of epic proportions. An orchestra of darkness.<br /><br />- APPRECIATION 1: In Tim Burton's cartoonish version, the use of heavy machinery and artillery, call it high-tech vehicles like armored cars, jets, boats equiped with machine guns and missiles, seemed admirable and visually spectacular. In Nolan's more realistic self-justified version where action and substance require a little bit more explanation, a superhero who don't kill but stun his enemies with martial arts techniques and uses fear as a primary weapon, never lets technology eclipse the main figure. The original simplicity and effectiveness of the original concept,the dark bat silhouette terrifing criminals with a haunting music score, prevails with great balance in that matter. After all, tools are only that, a mean to a purpose, no further function but the benefit of a great tech-show.<br /><br />-APRECIATION 2: The first movie was about the birth and evolution of batman in both physical and spiritual ways, it was about growth and the overcoming of fear and fear itself (scarecrow, bruce wayne and bats, etc,). There were powerful concepts behind the expected action movie. This movie is more about Batman and the Joker and pushing the limits of each character, the portrayal of an epic battle in wich parallel stories don't loose importance, cause there's no ramifications in the straight forward solid plot. Humanity is essential to accomplish deepness of characters and realism in the situations, in order to drag the audiences into magnified but serious events. That's why Nolan didn't choose mutants between Batman's enemies but people on the edge like the main character, astonishing visuals are just a consequence of behaviour, of logic or emotional choices, and that's the goal here: Aproach, empathy, the stuff that makes a movie an experience beyond senses.<br /><br />Having saying everything without telling nothing, i suggest you run to your local theather to see for yourselves. Your money's worth is guaranteed, no doubt. SPECTACULAR viewing, in every single possible aspect. Nolan's ingenious, artful but prudent use of the camera in big and small takes is amazing, such effectiveness turns every situation and place into an event to behold.<br /><br />Missing half star? Nolan's best is still to come, and believe it or not, he didn't played his entire game. I like to think the next chapter will be a flawless, complete achievement. But make no mistake: This movie is beyond a superhero movie, an absolute standard breaker.ot recommended, but Maggie Gyllenhaal taking over Rachel Dawes's  character from Katie Holmes was almost a good idea.

Nolan's best is still to come, and believe it or not, he didn't played his entire game. I like to think the next chapter will be a flawless, complete achievement. But make no mistake: This movie is beyond a superhero movie, an absolute standard breaker.
B000O1799U|2.0|Knowing it was a musical I was prepared for a fair portion of singing but had not expected a movie hardly with any spoken lines! There must have been about 1 full hour of song and to make matters worse most of the material ranged from forgettable to outright unmelodious or awkward. The cast certainly proved they could sing but with hardly a spoken line and without a decent storyline it made for very long and dull viewing.
1552091090|1.0|I had to read this book for one of my field experiences. While the toddlers loved it and were laughing, I thought this book was horrible. It was explained to me (and also in some of the positive reviews here) that it's only a metaphor. I think that is too easy of a label to stick onto something in which the author, Robert Munsch,is so obviously disturbed. I think most people agree when the Mom (now an elderly lady) drives across town with a LADDER on top of her car it truly crosses a line.   I would like to ask the people who think this book is only a harmless  metaphor in love, would you still adore this book and give it five  stars and endless kudos if the gender roles were reversed?     I could've given this book 'no stars', if that was  an option. When I have school librarians and PH.D's also posting  why they dislike this book, then I know this so-called classic  is really an exercise in the warped mind of the author.
B00003CWL6|5.0|There have been so many reviews of this movie I will limit my comment to state my sheer amazement after reading the 1 STAR reviews ...<br /><br />It is beyond comprehension this brilliant piece of artistry can be rated below 3 STARS by anyone.... In my mind it is one of the most socio-realistic screen plays that have ever come out of Hollywood - not due to the (perhaps overly) tragicomic characterizations but because each character represents something real in all of us... But maybe that does not resonate with those among us who prefer to see the world as black and white rather than the accumulation of shades of grey we all live and live in.<br /><br />For me this is one of my top10 movies of all time and one of the very few I can watch again and again.
B00005AWMF|5.0|No matter what mood I'm in, I'm in the mood for Sade.  This CD combines all her best hits and some that I didn't even know about until I bought the CD.  A great value as it's been years since it's release but trust me...it will make you feel good and transport you to a serene place.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Rust in Peace is considered by most Megadeth fans to be one of their best albums of all time, and considered to be one of the best metal albums of all time. It might take a couple of listens, but you'll find yourself loving this album if you're a Megadeth fan. It should be noted that Mustaine has an... odd voice. Some like it, some hate it, that can't be helped. But the instruments are amazing.<br /><br />Holy Wars... The Punishment Due: It's two songs, sort of. The first part is Holy Wars which, well, is about holy wars while The Punishment Due is about the comic book The Punisher. The song is a a fast hard-hitting intro the this album. The acoustic bridge sounds great for some reason, probably because lead guitarist Marty Friedman incorporates many Arabic and Eastern scales into his music. 10/10<br /><br />Hangar 18: This song might as well be instrumental, but it's a damn good one. The lyrics (however few they may be) are about a supposed military hangar, Hangar 18, where the Air Force supposedly stored a crashed UFO and its extraterrestrial pilots. Tin foil hat or not, the song is notable for its myriad of solos that are technical and sexy. All sorts of great riffs and solos throughout this song. 10/10<br /><br />Take no Prisoners: It's about prisoners of war and war in general. I don't particularly like it too much, but it's got good main riffs. Not much to say, I've always seen it as the odd one out. 7/10<br /><br />Five Magics: Fast at first, then suddenly a cool bass interlude leading into some medium-pace guitar. Then Mustaine starts singing, with various little solos between the verses. The song is fast and technical, the solos are blaring, the drums are heavy. Sort of reminds of me Holy Wars for some reason. 9/10<br /><br />Poison Was the Cure: Starting off with a slow but catchy bass line, the guitar then comes in. After a quick drum breakdown, the fast guitar work gets going. A short but sweet song. 10/10<br /><br />Lucretia: A somewhat jazzy main riff to this in all honesty. That's a good thing, the whole song sounds good. The solos are nice, although not quite as fast as the next song's. 9/10<br /><br />Tornado of Souls: By far my favorite song from the album. The main riff, the intro, the bridges, they're all so good. But the best part is the minute-long solo by the great Marty Friedman. It's not necessarily the fastest, but it is by far one of if not the best sounding solo on the album. Every time I hear it I just have to whip out my miniature air guitar... it's amazing. 10/10<br /><br />Dawn Patrol: The bass line is catchy (like Poison Was The Cure's) but it's a kinda boring song. Yawn Patrol? 6/10<br /><br />Rust in Peace... Polaris: Underrated. The drum intro sounds tribal, and the song is simply angry. It conveys the idea of a nuclear warhead that knows its destructive power pretty well, because it's just so damn heavy. Then you get Polaris, which is essentially a long solo. Great closer. 9/10<br /><br />If you're trying to get into Megadeth, I'd probably recommend their Greatest Hits album simply because it gives you a taste of all their years. If you liked that, or if you want to get into \\"the good stuff\\" right away, then by all means get this album. It does not relent, it does not give up its thrash metal assault until it's left you on the ground begging for mercy from the great solos.whole song sounds good.

037571457X|4.0|I feel I learned more about the history of Iran through the eyes of a little girl who was practically forced to become an adult by the age of 14 than most textbooks.  Marjane Satrapi, or \\"Marji\\" captured my attention, thanks to the successful marriage of her \\"crudely-drawn\\" panels and approachable narrative.  While I have yet to read the sequel, I feel I know this individual on a personal level as the book fills us in on her deepest fears and hopes and conflicts.
6305428557|4.0|This is a fun movie about people accomplishing a goal that only has value to those of their town.<br />The towns people are enjoyable characters who come off as genuine as the country side is beautiful.
B000AP04L0|4.0|\\"Office Space\\" is a great film from the brilliant mind of Mike Judge. Ron Livingston plays corporate drone Peter Gibbons who has a totally unhappy and stressed life. Thanks to the only partially intentional assistance from a therapist using hypnosis in the single funniest scene in the film, Peter relaxes and reaps the rewards of sloth. The films makes a legitimate point about promotion up the corporate ladder in the most humorous manner possible.<br /><br />The characters in the film are all caricatures of idealized cubicle dwellers, and remind me of a cross between \\"Dilbert\\" and the cast of \\"The Office.\\" The film is well acted, and you will see favorite actors from several favorite sitcoms: John C. McGinley from \\"Scrubs\\" is brilliant as Bob the consultant; Diedrich Bader from \\"The Drew Carey Show\\" is brilliant as a blue collar neighbor, and Jennifer Aniston shines as Joanna, a waitress with flair!<br /><br />The film deserves five stars save for one misstep in postproduction: the soundtrack. The soundtrack is filled with extremely violent rap music, which not only fails to enhance the film, it actually detracts markedly from it.<br /><br />If you are willing to face life in a cube farm, you need to face up to \\"Office Space,\\" and check out the extras, too. The deleted scenes are, in several cases, absolute highlights: the scene where Peter confronts the receptionist is absolutely priceless, and justifies the cost of the film alone.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I purchased this DVD with anticipation, but was disappointed.    First off, the warm up exercises did not work opposing muscle groups, and to think of doing each section 10 days for a total of 30 days means a lopsided muscle use.    Secondly, the routines were uninspired.  Moves were basic, making them easy to follow; but the lack of imagination in the routines left me feeling a bit bored.  Jullian's cuing was good and her safety explanations included demonstrations - a real benefit.     On the positive side, this is a good workout for getting metabolism burn in only 20 minutes. I exercise to  videotapes regularly, but still felt this one the next day.  Having said this, though, I found the negative points to be sigificant enough that I have gotten rid of my tape after only 5 viewings.  It is too monotonous and there are too many good workouts that are balanced and stimulating to have to make myself do one that is imbalanced and boring.
B000089RVX|5.0|This really is an exceptional CD. In my opinion \\"Fallen\\" is a must own. Unfortunately, I think they raised the bar so high that it will be impossible for them to ever reestablish the magic to create another CD of this caliber.  The membership realignment certainly didn't help the cause for the second CD.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|When I saw this version of \\"Zodiac\\" in the budget bin, it was an impulse purchase.  I'd seen the film in the theatre.  The strange thing for me is that I remembered this as being an older film, like 2000 or so.  Made last year, David Fincher directed this and was nominated for Best Director from Film Critics in Chicago and Toronto.  Fincher's other films include \\"Panic Room,\\" \\"Fight Club\\" & \\"Seven.\\"  One might expect a bloody thriller, but instead \\"Zodiac\\" is an intense drama centered on Robert Graysmith's compulsion to find the killer.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhall who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for [[ASIN:B00005JOFQ Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)]] and actually won @ the British Academy Awards plays the role with subtle but growing indications of Graysmith's strength of conviction.  Since Graysmith is a cartoonist at the San Francisco paper, his mission about this case seems to come from left field.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo won a Best Actor Award from the Montreal World Film Festival for \\"You Can Count On Me\\" and shined in one of my favorite films, [[ASIN:B000CQM4Y2 Just Like Heaven (Widescreen Edition)]].  As Inspector David Toschi, he does a good job of bird-dogging the case, but then even he reaches a point where he wants to throw in the towel.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays San Francisco reporter Paul Avery whose arrogance leads him into pursuit.  Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for \\"Chaplin\\" and won a Golden Globe for \\"Ally McBeal\\" in 2000.  He shows the deterioration of the character into an alcoholic haze.<br /><br />Brian Cox does an excellent job as Melvin Belli.  Anthony Edwards from TV's \\"ER\\" plays Inspector William Armstrong who comes to prefer a desk job.  The film is a good psychological study of the main characters tracking the killer.  The final scene where Graysmith goes into the hardware store and stares at the guy he knows did it, but is unable to prove is intense.  The film got Best Picture nominations from Film critics in the Southeast, Las Vegas & Oklahoma.  Enjoy!gas & Oklahoma.  Enjoy!
6305313687|5.0|Vintage years for film seem to come in bunches - the late forties - the late nineties - being primary examples.  In the thick - when the critics become the most confused  - spoiled by the surfeit, we, the movie going masses seem to troop along.  Such a year for film was 1998-1999.  Most of us have had our differences with the judgments of The Academy of Arts and Sciences (if you're not smiling by now - don't read further).  But none of the Academy's many shameful blunders compare to what went down on Oscar night 1998.  Let me remind you.  The nominees for best picture: Shakespeare In Love (winner), Elizabeth, Life is Beautiful (Best Foreign Language Film winner), Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line.  O.K.  I'll ask:  Would any of you today, in your right mind, claim that any of these films (every one of them set in Europe, by the way), with the possible exception of Saving Private Ryan, held a candle to that enduring masterpiece, in the opinion of so many here, and elsewhere, one of the greatest and most important and moving films ever made, American History X?<br /><br />Over time, the vox populi imparts justice of sorts.  These days, when I inquire of my 20-something students if any of them have seen Shakespeare In Love, maybe a hand goes up.  Perhaps, this handily-crafted piece of fluff (with its cavalier sense of history) made all the more delicious by the mellifluous, long-waisted presence of La Paltrow, goddess of the late dot com boom in the blush of young beauty, deserved a better fate.  Perhaps not.  Perhaps, the spectacle of Gwynnie dancing with Daddy (like Candy) at her Oscar coronation helped prepare T.V. audiences for the nepotistic profligacy of the coming Bush inauguration.  Perhaps, nothing could have prepared them.<br /><br />The response to American History X is, of course, quite different.  A decade later, an entirely new generation of viewers again experiences the intensity and passion of this magisterial cinematic statement and responds in kind.  My point is: there's no substitute for a film which has something crucial say and says it as well as it could be said.<br /><br />We all know how much inconsequential junk is passed of as cinema every year.  Like the audience, the film industry must eat to stay alive.  Clich&eacute;s, humorless as ever, abound.  Ask Bruce Willis to say something on film.  That's why I'm upset.  When a great script gets made into a masterpiece, in Hollywood no less, even the best tend to shun or worse, pan it.  Or misunderstand it. This film is about a lot more than misguided white racist supremacy. Please.  And Derek's rhetoric is not that logically powerful or convincing to be obsessed over, as many critics have, at the expense of all the many more important things this film says.<br /><br />Take the greatest screenwriting mentors: Robert McKee and Syd Field.  McKee's masterpiece, Story, may be best book ever written on dramatic writing (roll over Aristotle), or writing narrative, period.  Sine qua non for attempting to write for the cinema.  What is the favorite script of these genius pedagogues?  Chinatown.  No doubt a great script - the textbook exemplar.  And - in many senses a great film - made at a pivotal moment in the history of film - a moment it eulogized - the passing of film noir.  Yeah.  The ultimate corruption of the world, the masked and massive darkness we found our world on.  The perversity of power we enshrine in our struggle for survival. But to tell you truly, American History X (to my knowledge wholly ignored by both Field and McKee in their writings and seminars) is the greater script (for all the principles it betrays) and the greater film.  The proof is in the pudding: this film enunciates the essential conflict of our time, not another, or the fruit of that conflict, whichever way one wishes to see it.  And I would go further.  I would say, in the progressive cadences of its tragedy, in the somber measure of its gravity, this script ranks with the bestof Aescylus and Sophocles.  You mean Oedipus X? Yuh, that too. That grimy little block of Venice, CA takes on epic proportion by the film's end.<br /><br />The night the Academy snubbed American History X has long since receded into the past.  But that history which is ours, depicted here, is an event which we must claim as our own, a responsibility which none of us, as a humanity, can evade.ou mean Oedipus X? Yuh, that too.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|WOW! In a word, incredible. History comes to life through the performances of Giamatti, Linney and the others. It is very true to David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize winning book, which was one of the best books that I have ever read. The series is a must-see and the book is a must-read for anyone who has any interest in America's Revolution and early history. Watching the trials and tribulations of Adams, Washington, Jefferson and the other founding fathers as they struggled, gives one a whole new perspective of how these imperfect men worked together to create a new nation in very trying times.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|Julia Roberts is cast as a young, idealistic teacher who takes her first teaching job at a strait-laced Ivy League girl's college. She strives to bring the girls into the 20th Century by teaching the women from affluent families to think for themselves and use their free will to make independent choices for their futures. Entwined with her clash with the school's straight laced approach to educating women, there is romance for her and her students. Placed in the early 1950's when the growth of women's' liberation started, it has great significance. I would recommend it to every girl in high school or college. It's a great story with meaning.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Having finally rented this DVD after all the praise and an Oscar, I was expecting a good dose of hilarity. What I got was a dark rewrite of [[ASIN:B00009NHC9 National Lampoon's Vacation]] brought up to these [[ASIN:B00005JNBQ Napoleon Dynamite]] times. It's dark, cynical and relentlessly bleak, even if moments of really funny stuff bounce off the bleakness.<br /><br />The actors are all well suited for their roles, with Abigail Breslen perfect as Olive and Alan Arkin getting the snarkiest lines as the heroin snorting granddad. Steve Carell proved he had dramatic chops here, even he is forced to play the gay clich&eacute; to the max, and Paul Dano gets a heck of a lot of mileage out of not speaking for most of the film.<br /><br />However, the film never really nails its timing. Funny bits are spaced with long pits of dysfunction, forcing you to deal with the fact that these people are genuinely annoying. The finale is a hoot, but again, every person here loses their dream. The payoff a broad comedy aims at the arthouse crowd...or maybe fans of Carell. Put aside the hype, and you have a stunningly average bit of filmmaking.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay's latest CD does something that albums used to do back in the day:  Add something to our music culture.  Viva La Vida is not really a concept album in the traditional sense, but it certainly has the feel.  The first track, Life in Technicolor, acts as the overture.  It is ambient, optimistic, yet a reserved piece indicating what may be yet to come.  Lost is a Coldplay anthem with the repeating last line, \\"I'm waiting 'til the shine to wear off.\\"  The title track is a brilliant pop song that is brand new but sounds familiar.  The final song, Death and All His Friends ends with a refrain of the first song.  The production by Eno has echoes of U2's Unforgettable Fire, but that is good since that might be U2's second greatest recording (Joshua Tree being first if anyone is keeping score).  All in all, this is an incredible album during the music industry's worst hour.
B00005B1W5|5.0|I am purchasing this DVD for myself and one for my grandson.  Yes, I have heard it, via a friend, and I was immediately taken with it. The talent is magnificent. Not sure always what Yanni is doing, but he seems to be enjoying himself, and I have to disagree with comments against him. He and the producers have provided us with something wonderful. I think those who like this would like David Phelps (probably my favorite). I say this, because I put him on right after Yanni, and saw some similarity. To me Yanni Tribute is inspirational, and watching the faces in the audience is a treat in itself. The singers, the musicians, the audience! Bravo!!!!  There are not many albums that I like as a whole, but I like this one, big time.
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|I bought the single Viva la Vida after listening only to the 30 second clip. I never do that. I usually have to know a song to like it enough to buy it. But I knew this song was something good. I have to say I am addicted. The music is great, the lyrics are so interesting. Martin's voice is better than ever. Coldplay has stayed true to their unusual sound, but still came up with something so new and different and original.
B00140PK6O|4.0|Michael Gambon, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, Francesca Annis, and many others are a joy to watch and lose oneself in the storyline.  The scenery and costumes are perfect.  There are multiple love stories going on, and I appreciate Elizabeth Gaskell as a writer.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I have never seen John Mayer perform live.  This two disc set is the next best thing to watching him play live in the Nokia theater.  He performs most of his hits here.  I love the acoustic versions of \\"Daughters\\", \\"Neon\\" and a lesser known track entitled \\"Stop This Train\\".  Mayer's cover of Tom Petty's \\"Free Fallin'\\"  John can jam on the guitar like no musician I've seen this decade.  I love his performances of the bluesy track \\"Vultures\\" and the fast pace of the track \\"Who Did You  Think I Was\\"  My other favorite tracks  are \\"Waiting On The World To Change\\" and \\"Why Georgia\\".  This are such happy songs that John performs with his band.  I also love the song \\"Gravity\\".  It is a slow paced track in which John displays his vocal skills.  I love the music of John Mayer.

0446402389|5.0|This book is no romp in the park but an exciting murder mystery set in a world I knew little about.  Leo is an agent of the state who becomes the victim of a selfish and ruthless subordinate.  Demoted, he is sent off to a nowhere little town away from Moscow.  His wife, Raisa, is a cold and emotionless partner.<br /><br />And then . . . they begin to change and, as they do, to grow on the reader.  They become dimensional humans, vulnerable humans, no longer  stick figures, as they join in a search for a ruthless serial killer whose victims are innocent children.<br /><br />Russia in the late Stalinist and early Kruschev periods is a harsh setting for this fascinating story.  And it is that very harshness that shows the reader how people are manipulated by fear, that makes the reader feel their fear and empathize.<br /><br />A compelling story that works on several levels at once, illuminating  human nature without becoming preachy. Child 44 is the child of a masterful storyteller (applause, applause).<br /><br />Five stars!
B000M4RG4C|5.0|Excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I like WWII movies since I have a connection to that era.  Very well done.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|While I loved the origianal theater version of Kingdom of Heaven,  the Director's Cut is superior in many ways. Many questions are answered and the character development is filled out. The theater version completely cut out the Queen's son just to make the movie shorter. If you liked the theater version, I highly recommend buying the Director's Cut.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Wow.  Another CD with good music and different as expected.<br /><br />My only thing is some of the Mariah fans bashing Madonna is really stupid!<br />Not only are you making a fool out of yourself doing it but Mairah  WILL NEVER EVER come even close to Madonna's stature, reputation, or otherwise.  Globally she is #1 and after listening to MAriah's CD I can say it officially sucks and I'm surprised it sold.  It's the same ole crap and predictable.<br /><br />Mariah fans who dis Madonna you shouldn't be comparing singers to performers it shows what an idiot you really are when even trying to compare that to a performer and there is a difference in the two! Oh but she broke Elvis' record.  That's IT???  And what oscars has she won, she sits on stage and sings and thats it.  LAME LAME LAME.  She doesn't even sing pop or if that is pop who would have guessed.  Sorry can't stand her music it's just lame.  Nice voice no talent other than that.<br />Well Madonna has broken any record a female artist ever thought to have. And lets get real Mariah will never get in the hall of fame.  She's a singer with no creativity on or off stage with cd's that fall flat as they all sound alike.  So maybe she should come out with the next album called, \\"AGAIN\\" and just reprint her picture from the MC2 album since we all know how bad the attempts will be to go up against Madonna.  She's an idiot herself thinking of releasing records when Madonna does.  Did you see her record get bounced off the billboard when Hard Candy came out.  It was like Madonna said sorry you dont belong here and pushed her off the chart.  LOL<br /><br />Read and shut up about Mariah (sorry her new cd really does suck the big one).  Touch Me??? Thats creative she'll win over the world with that one!.:<br />[...]<br /><br />NOW SHUT IT stop dissing the BETTER performer and stop comparing a little barbie doll SINGER to something not even in the same league.<br />Kelly Clarkson or Celin Dion would be a more appropriate comparison.<br />Except, Kelly does more on stage than Mariah.than Mariah.

B00007BK2N|5.0|First of all, if you have any interest in the Manchester music scene starting in '76 and ending just before Oasis hit, you need to watch this movie.  Second of all, if you want to know more of the real story, watch the movie with the commentary by Tony Wilson.  He tells some of what \\"really\\" happened, although he tells it with a favorable bent towards himself.  It is still one of my favorite all time movies, and because of it I can't listen to \\"Atmosphere\\" without bursting into tears, both for Ian and a friend of mine that used to cover it that recently passed away due to epilepsy.  R.I.P. Ian and Derek.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) is far from a perfect man. In fact he's a terrible terrible person. But you end up overlooking that fact for the simple reason that he makes you laugh. Most of the scrapes he gets himself into would be easily taken care of if he could simply tell the truth. But that concept is foreign to him.<br /><br />This series ran the perfect amount of time, ending while it was still hilarious. Each episode is a unique story, never retreading old ground. If you are a fan of the British use of both irony and farce, this is a virtual treasure trove of humor.
015626224X|5.0|The book itself describes the daily lives of people in two different nations/societies that were impoverished in his era. The way that they struggled to just receive the bare minimum as far as food and shelter are eye opening. To anyone entertaining ideas about accepting libertarianism please read this to understand how we as a society really do need to look out for one another. The parts that he includes showing the social hierarchy in poor groups is entirely necessary and in itself amazingly descriptive. Do read this because you will most definately not be disappointed.
0307383415|5.0|Politically me and Senator Obama are pretty closely aligned for the exception of Sen. Obama being a litle warmer to the idea of government sponsored solutions to our nation's most pressing problems. In this book you see that way of thinking exposed at key moments. Take for instance when he is helping some folks with housing, in which he fails to call out that government sponsored housing has been one of the most socially disastrous actions ever undertaken. His stories are still profoundly moving and show how they shape the man that we see today. It is a must read if you are planning on voting! It quickly and strongly explains some of the nonsense that conservatives will cling on to in order to undermine him.
0307237702|4.0|This book is a good book and an absolutely enjoyable experience. My issue with this book (why there are 4 instead of 5 stars)is that it doesn't have some of that edge that his other book had. In D.F.M.F. he was able to show us the readers that his life and ascendancy to political prominance was anything but easy. By doing that he gave me personally a feeling that almost anything can be accomplished with enough courage and hard work. This book on the other hand shows how he hasn't forgotten about his constituents but fails to inspire as strongly as his other work. Definately do pick it up, it's still a good read just not great one.

This is one of those works, one that should be required reading for high school students, or, at the very least, for college students, if it isn't already.  The horror that was the A-bomb unleashed unbridled power over the city of Hiroshima.  Arguments could be made for both the necessity for the bomb to end the war, as well as the unnecessary and catastrophic violence unleashed.    Either way you argue, Hersey's Hiroshima shows the true nature of the bomb from when it was dropped, the after effects, and the resulting long term medical problems the Hibukusha had to live with for the rest of their lives.  I was awestruck at the description of what had happened, at times shaking my head at the power of such a bomb.  Soldiers who had their eyes melted out of their sockets, people whose skin was slophing off, skinned burned off leaving raw and puss covered skin.    These are of course present throughout Hersey's account, for how could we see what the survivors of Hiroshima went through if the descriptions are not there as well?  We see unselfish and caring individuals putting their own health and safety at risk to help others worse off.  We see the strength of human nature to struggle on despite the hopeless feeling that imbedded into all who were present.    Hersey does a great job showing what happened, with people whose lives are all interrelated and connected in sundry ways, as well as to show how their lives carried on in the years after the A-bomb had been dropped.  This is most certainly a recommend for young and old alike, and I would recommend it to all, regardless of the genre's they prefer to read.    5 stars.

B00005MP58|5.0|2006: Given the time constraints of a movie, this version does not develop the characters very well which is the cornerstone of Janes' writing, the spoken word does not follow the book, the characters are not as mannerly as they are written in the book, major parts of the book are missing (ie., the Bingley sisters, many of the piano performances by Elizabeth are missing, some of the balls are not in this version), the English dialect is not constantly spoken. I given this version 3 stars.    1996: Given the luxious length, this version does develop  the characters very well, is true to Janes' book, is stellar in the use of manners of the day, major parts of the book are not missing including the best part of the whole series which is Janes' performance at Penberly on the piano - she and Mr. Darcy actually make love just looking at one another - yummy performance, and the English dialect is spoken throughout.  The Bingley sisters are present and a major part of the movie as well as Elizabeths' mother which is so excellently played!!  I would say Jane herself would be so proud of this version that I would given it 10 srars if I could but for now we'll give it 5 stars

B001B93PQ0|4.0|This recording of a live concert consists of three sets: an acoustic set, a John Mayer Trio set, and a set with personnel from \\"Continuum.\\" The varying instrumentation gives a lot of freedom for Mayer to change styles and energy levels.  This album shows that John Mayer is not only a skilled recording artist, but talented live performer as well. He's relatively young, but his lyrics and solo improvisation skills show a depth rarely found these days. His playing reminds me of Eric Clapton or David Gilmour (Pink Floyd).  Personal favorite: the 9:41 version of Gravity, with awesome solo work at the end.
B0012Q732O|5.0|The film _10,000 B.C._ (2008) directed by Roland Emmerich is an excellent film set in prehistoric times with a unique and panoramic vision.  I think the film is very likely influenced by the writings of fantasy action writer Robert E. Howard and certainly bears resemblance to the Conan films.  The film takes place in prehistoric times when mammoths, saber-toothed cats, and giant birds roamed the landscape and men lived a simple hunter-gatherer type existence in the central Eurasian mountains (probably taking some liberty with actual historical fact of course).  The film focuses on the Yagahl tribe who live in harmony with nature hunting mammoths.  Two important characters from this tribe will serve as the central protagonists for the story - the young hunter D'Leh and the beautiful Evolet.  In addition, the old mother, a shaman woman of the Yagahl tribe, plays a central role in the story.  One day while hunting the mammoth, a group of warlords manage to kidnap Evolet and the young hunter must pursue them across the Levant in his effort to save her.  However, after passing through many terrors, the hunter and his band of warriors encounter an evil civilization where they must work as slaves building great pyramids for \\"the Almighty\\", a mysterious god-man who controls the slaves and for whom they must pay constant tribute.  \\"The Almighty\\" demands that one of their own must be sacrificed to show the slaves that they must work harder for him.  Ultimately, it is D'Leh who must lead the slaves in a rebellion against this evil man worshipped as a god and in an effort to rescue his love Evolet.  Unfortunately, Evolet bears a mark upon her hand which shows her to be one of great power which \\"the Almighty\\" fears.  In a fitting end, the noble D'Leh leads his people and the other slave peoples in a glorious revolt against the wicked masters.  The masters show themselves to be cowards as they beg before their god \\"the Almighty\\".  However, D'Leh manages to throw a spear piercing\\"the Almighty\\" and thus killing him proving once and for all that he was no god but a mere mortal and evil man.  Sic semper tyrannis!  The slaves escape their masters, but first a last challenge must be faced by D'Leh and Evolet, and oddly the role of the old mother is to play an important part here.  Thus, ends this film.    I found this film to be highly enjoyable and was particularly fond of the brilliant scenes.  This film has been compared to Mel Gibson's _Apocalypto_ (2006) and I believe that makes a good comparison.  All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and give it a good recommendation.
B00005JNX0|5.0|Fantastic.... Story line great, actors and actresses are better then expected, great adult humor along with the values needed for children. I actually purchased this movie new when it came out. I lent it to someone and never got it back. So I bought it again, because it is so great. I would say this movie gets watched approximately 6 to 8 times a year. Excellent Movie!
0743270754|4.0|Team of Rivals starts with following the lives of four different people prior to the 1860 presidential race. The four people were Seward (becomes Sec of State), Chase (becomes Sec of Treasury), Bates (becomes Attorney General) and finally Lincoln. Doris does a fine job in describing the events that led up to the Republican nomination. She tries to make the point that one of Lincoln's great political moves was incorporating these rivals into his cabinet. The story of these 4 individuals is interesting to read and leads up to the climax of the Republican nomination at about page 256 (book is 754 pages total).   However, her point then fizzles out after this point. Bates becomes a minor character in the book. Furthermore I came to realize that the fact Lincoln picked these rivals as his cabinet members was not necessarily such a brilliant move. First, Presidents' choosing of their rivals for political appointments is nothing particularly interesting, new or unique.  For example, Vice Presidential nominees are frequently the Presidents' nominees. When I first heard  about the book's premise, I expected the rivals to have been from the opposite party but I soon found out that was not the case. Second, the fact that Lincoln picked his rivals did not necessarily add to the effectiveness of his administration. As Doris shows there was a lot of arguments among the cabinet members and Lincoln had to mediate frequently.      Doris does a very nice job depicting Lincoln's genius however. Lincoln had a lot of unique and outstanding qualities that made his years as President a huge success. The author could have focused on a lot of these other attributes. For example, Lincoln's generosity and amazing ability for forgiveness was truly unique. He once said, \\"I destroy my enemies when I make them my friends\\" (this quote was not in the book). This way of looking at the world and actually acting on it certainly contributed greatly to his success and unfortunately after his assassination because of its absence made reconstruction a lot more difficult.     The book is  perhaps too long with some parts and quotes not being relevant. It would have been better if it were shorter. Nevertheless I highly recommend it for its clarity, thorough research and excellent writing.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I didn't discover Firefly until the reruns hit the Sci-Fi Channel - call me a late bloomer. What a find this show is - witty, action-packed and dramatic, a rare combination. The DVD extras are few, but a wonderful interview with cast and crew, who were truly heartbroken when it was cancelled. It also adds another layer knowing the fans rallied to resurrect the show as a movie. Though this is a great collection for those who are just finding the show, I'm leaving off one star for myself, and the fact that I did not buy the newest, expanded DVD.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|Sometimes, rarely, after having watched dozens upon dozens of disappointing films, you get lucky and come across one that not only lives up to, but surpasses all the praise that more often than not was just hype anyways. And... also sometimes, you go back to watch it a second time just to see if your first impression was correct, and you are horrified to see that you were mistaken and that this is just a lousy film and you don't know what you were thinking. Have I sufficiently confused you? Then let me just say that this film, \\"Shelter\\", was one of the most beautiful, surprising, well acted, noble films I've ever seen. These actors, most of whom are either unknown or not \\"stars\\", are so, so much better than the small but undying, rotating, irritating crop of so called superstars that monopolize every churned out piece of Hollywood garbage. The performances here are so seamless, modest, and real, that you feel that you are watching just that, real life. Of course, watching real life can be boring, and what most actors and films of today completely fail at is to not only make the story interesting, but enables it to go beyond being entertainment to give it that intangible element of realism that  truly moves you. In this film you feel their pain, joy, loneliness, frustration,  and liberation in your very gut, and that is rare for  films today, especially a \\"small' film that does not bang you over the head with special effects or try and bring a tear to your eye with overacting and ear splitting sweeping music.  Though this film has a gay story line, it is relevant to anyone who is alive, and it's message about love, loyalty, and being true to yourself is for everyone. I will not go on and i will not tell you the story line as plenty of other reviewers have already done this, and some of them very well.  I will only say that as a person who grew up loving the movies and having been disappointed in 95% of all the films made in the last 25 years, it is so refreshing, enjoyable, and heartening to come across a film as beautiful as this one. It is poetry. It is perfect. It hopefully makes some people aware that there are different and positive qualities that define a \\"family.\\" It is the best film of it's kind that I have ever seen. And the actors, director, writer, etc..should all be extremely proud of their accomplishment, and, as a disheartened, quality- starved filmgoer, i thank them all.oyable, and heartening to come across a film as beautiful as this one.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E should be seen by people of all ages. Don't be quick to judge this as something just for children, for there are plenty of adult overtones amidst the simplicities of emotions and feelings [that a child could relate to]. I'm an adult and I think this is one of the best animations I've ever seen, both visually and emotionally. Labeling it enjoyable wouldn't do it justice.<br /><br />Wall-E is a fun, lovable robot whose directive (a term you'll find used quite a bit) is  just to compact trash. That's it. Compact trash again and again. But this little guy has a personality and cute mannerisms that will allow you to appreciate his character more than you would expect. It doesn't matter that he can't speak - you'll love him. As expected with Pixar pictures, our protagonist is introduced, then faces a difficult situation, successfully deals with said situation, and a happy ending follows. The plot slightly suffers when Wall-E faces his obligatory difficult situation, but the visuals barely save it. Prepare for an ending of gratification.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|By far, the best production on one of the founders of our republic. Although John Adams was the smartest of our founders, he was not the most astute politically. The United States has to be the luckiest nation in the history of mankind. First there was geography. That we were an ocean away from Europe was important. Also we had such talented leaders at the right time. Whereas Franklin & Jefferson, to name the two most prominent, were charismatic & diplomatic as well as brillant, Adams was obnoxious, blunt & disliked. Washington was the undisputed leader & general of the army. As the first president, the constitution was written for him. Adams was obliged to follow him. How could he? How could anyone? This seven episode dvd was based on David McCullough's book. I read the book the week it came out several years ago & see few simularities, but maybe I need to reread it. I especially enjoyed some of the lesser known moments in history. Seven British soldiers were charged with murder in the incident know as the Boston Massacre. No one would defend them. Adams took the job & they were aquitted thereby reinforcing the idea that all accused are entitled to legal counsel, a concept we hold dear to this  day. Another moving moment was when John was absent, Abigail had their young children innoculated against the small pox epidemic. It is a bit graphic but effective. Abigail Adams remains as his most important advisor through their life. Wife, lover, best friend & critic she never failed him. The one person he could always trust unconditionally. Excellent casting of Paul Giamatti & Laura Linney as John & Abigail. A heavily made-up David Morse plays a rather wooden but effective George Washington. This is definately a high end, movie quality production. Through seven plus hours you get the feel of 18th century America. Buying the dvd you also get \\"the making of...\\" & a David McCullough biography. I could go on & on about Adam's time abroad, the revolution itself, his family &presidency. This review has gone long enough & there are plenty of other reviews that will fill you in. Well worth owning.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan (as my screen name suggests!), and I refused to listen to this CD until now.  I'm a purist when it comes to the Beatles -- no covers, no remixes, no muzak arrangements, no alt-rock interpretations, thankyouverymuch.  Just the originals.  But my curiosity finally got the best of me, so I ordered a copy (truth be told, I just wanted to bring my order amount up to the free shipping minimum), and now I regret I didn't buy this sooner.  George and Giles Martin have done a fantastic job remixing these Beatles classics.  There are some really interesting pairings -- pieces of \\"Drive My Car\\" coupled with \\"The Word?\\"  And it works -- beautifully.  It will never take the place of the originals for me -- I don't think George Martin intended it to -- but for me,  it was almost like hearing the music again -- for the first time.  I love this CD.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Most American children grow up learning the basic facts about the American Revolution, and can provide a general description of the Revolution in broad brush strokes. Some can go a little further, recounting more detailed information of specific portions of this history that might for some reason hold a special interest to them. What most Americans cannot do, however, is retell the story in chronological sequence from beginning to end, describing the specific role of each of the major persons who had a part in that story, and the interrelationships that make the story so unique.<br /><br />If you think that's what this series is about, you'd be wrong. It's not that you can't see the entire story play itself out - you most certainly will - but that you will rather learn the truth of the statement that a person can \\"get all the facts right, and miss the point entirely.\\" And perhaps this is where this most outstanding of documentaries on early American history excels, the ability to tell the story of the life of John Adams, while learning the facts surrounding the American Revolution only as they surrounded John Adams himself. And perhaps, for subject matter like this, the approach is one of the best one could take.<br /><br />The John Adams series lays out the seminal events of the American Revolution as John Adams viewed and participated in them (and he did participate in nearly every aspect of it throughout his long life), but allows us to do so  while experiencing the context through the outstanding storytelling and precise recreation of the period. We don't only witness the events; we are made to feel that we experience them, and find ourselves being transported into a world that in so many ways differs from our own. Along the way, the series makes us face the wrongs and unpleasantries of the era, but the focus is strictly on the rise of the American nation out of the individual colonies.<br /><br />The acting in this series is superb. Giamatti has perhaps given the performance of his career, and Laura Linney portrays Abigail Adams in such a sublime way that the character is strongly portrayed without overshadowing the story. Other characters (Jefferson, McHenry, Hamilton, and so on) are also excellently cast and acted, with the commanding presence of George Washington (David Morse) and the political creature Benjamin Franklin (Tom Wilkinson) played so impressively as to make one forget these are actors. To watch \\"John Adams\\" is to be introduced to each of these persons in a way never before thought possible.<br /><br />The series runs for seven episodes, for a total run time of just over eight hours. The filming itself is generally excellent, with some special effects that are well executed and quite realistic. There are some issues with the choice to employ odd camera angles and some hand-held scenes, sometimes which almost threatens to produce vertigo in the viewer, and have made more than one reviewer pan the series for these approaches to filmography. Although I, too, had trouble in some of these scenes (particularly in episode two, where it seems to be most frequently used), I can easily say not to let this affect your decision to watch the series. These are just quibbles, and in some cases, we can easily argue that these techniques help create the sense of \\"reality\\" that is needed to keep us fixated on the time period. The scenes depicting Paris and the Netherlands of the period are particularly fascinating.<br /><br />The music in the series is also outstanding. Anyone who watched the \\"Rome\\" series by HBO will undoubtedly recognize the similarities of the the opening title sequence, but I must say that this title sequence is one of the best I've ever seen. The music and visuals in the sequence are dramatic, lush, and even haunting.<br /><br />I've often thought that, from an educational standpoint, the American Revolution was similar to the French Revolution in that the number of people, the philosophical positions,the debates, the diverse background information, and other factors are so extensive and varied that it can make learning anything beyond the basic history quite challenging. Without building context, without knowing the history and biographical information of the major personages, without knowing the history leading up to the event, trying to place the epochal events in order so they make sense and can be examined is a tremendous task. And so, we end up with what we commonly see, people who know the broad brush strokes of the narrative, but would have trouble distinguishing between Danton and Robespierre, between Hamilton and Jefferson, between The Stamp Act and The Aliens and Seditions Act, or between the National Assembly and the National Constituent Assembly. And that's not to be critical: these events involved dozens of main players, took place over a period of multiple years, and involved the clash of deeply held beliefs about the nature of governance and the role of \\"rights.\\" This is not like learning a simple fact of history. But a series like this one can help overcome these issues by laying the foundation for a much deeper, ongoing exploration of early American history.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is one of the most superb documentaries I've ever seen. To watch it is to learn about John Adams and the role he played in the emergence of the United States, to learn about the American Revolution itself, and to become a participant in the debates, quarrels, and yes, politics, of the event. Its a powerful and moving story that evokes deep emotions and stimulates intense thought about America's founding.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|What a fabulous series. I spent the 4 most amazing hours watching it. I did not want it to end!     The cast is unforgetable with Richard Armitage as the stern, proud but compelling John Thornton,(he's so darn gorgeous!) and the lovely Daniela Denby-Ashe as the headstrong and forthright but charming Margaret Hale.     There's many similarities between, this series and Pride and Prejudice but it stands out brilliantly.  It's about a woman, Margaret Hale, from the South who moves from her romantic, sleepy laidback village, with her family, to the North and whose life collides with that of an intemperate if misunderstood industrialist, the charismatic mill-owner, John Thornton, in a bustling, northern city of Milton.     Instantly she gets into a dispute with him over his harsh treatment of an employee.   What she doesn't notice is Thornton's deep sense of responsibility for his employees' welfare. On the other hand, he misinterprets some of Margaret's own actions and intentions. But he is instantly attracted to her, while she has only the deepest contempt for him.   Later, she refuses his offer of marriage, only to realise far too late the kind of man he really is. Hard and harsh he may be, but he's also a man of stength and intergrity but it seems he no longer feels the same way he did about her, after catching her in a compromising situation... but despite it all, he still protects her reputation.   And that's another tangled web to watch unravel.     Like in most period drama's, they both are stubborn and drag out their obvious attraction over many painful months and events, and I loved every bit of it.     This series rates right up there for me along with Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre... perhaps ever higher. It's beautifully filmed and has some heart-wrenching moments that causes a tear or two.   I think John Thornton is the most romantic hero and he definitely beats Darcy, hands down. And I LIKE Darcy!  A definite keeper for me.
B00005JPKE|5.0|This is clearyly Clint Eastwood's greatest work.     We all get to see Iwo Jima. We all  know the image of the guys hoistng old Glory atop the Japanese Hill. We Americans have seen it in many films like the one with John Wayne but this time we get to see it through eyes of the other side that of the Japanese. From the ordinary grunt to the Japanese Navy officer who goes so gung ho that he tries to find himself an american tank to throw himself under but ultimately gets captured (This is based on a real person who was there in the battle and captured, read about him once in The Rising Sun by John Toland, wish they had shown more with him). To the General in charge. From the first arrival to the final charge, it shows the Japanese soldiers well. And Clint Eastwood serves us well telling us about them through their eyes with this film of his. Just as I respect him for showing what American soldiers were like as well. Since Japanese troops did not take prisoners and mistreatedt hose they took many American units did not take prisoners either.      Admittedly, the battle was well fought and due to lack of opprtunity, no major crimes typical of Japanese soldiers such as the rape of Nanking or the butchery of Manilla or the Bataan Death March or the murder and eating of captured American Airmen at near by Chichi Jima, so it is very easy to admire the Japenese here. Certainly I would have liked to know more and see more of Korean Labour units but apparently none were employed on the island.       Great film.

B0018AK9RK|5.0|With this newest installment in the legendary catalogue of Judas Priest we have a return to the concept album that was a popular genre back in the days when fans actually listed to albums from beginning to end.  I personally enjoyed this album because it reminded me of a bygone era when artist released music like this as opposed to a couple of formula hits with a set of filler material to exploit their fanbase and have an excuse to tour.   This is a very heavy album but it is not \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" they proved they can produce a scorcher with that one. On this album they offer us something that's a cross between a classic priest album and a Vincent Price movie. I liked it, it created a type of atmosphere that I didn't expect before listening to it.  Hopefully they'll take a page from Alice Cooper and incorporate a visual element into their act that enhances the album's original presentation.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|If you have seen the show and enjoyed it at all; of course you'll love season one!

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, I remember watching it with my dad when I was a kid. I also remember seeing it at a theatre in '98 that featured classic movies.   Gary Cooper's portrayal of a man who's only drive is to serve his country honorably when called and save as many of his men as he can is inspiring.   I grew up in Kentucky so Alvin York's story was part of our culture.   This is the type of movie I cannot turn away from, it commands my attention, and it reminds me of what a man should aspire to be.   In the majority of war movies being produced today there is always a focus on special forces or for lack of a better term a scripted hero. York never wanted to be a hero he only wanted what most men who have seen war will tell you, he wanted to stop the guns.   This is a classic movie and many of the ideas expressed are shaded in our modern culture, but they are still there waiting for the next generation to shine upon them.

B00004SAJK|4.0|A lot of folks, particularly the brigade that feels any UFO without Michael Schenker is worthless, seriously dump on this disc.  More so because of Pete Way's departure from UFO shortly after its release, claiming the band had started going soft.  Granted, if all non-Schenker UFO is rubbish to you, this disc won't be capable of changing your mind.  Regarding Pete Way comments, \\"The Writer\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" are both solid, and the fairly mellow \\"Back Into My Life\\" is one of Way's tunes.<br /><br />Measured up against some other Hard Rock of the day, say Def Leppard at the time of [[ASIN:B000001DVD High 'N' Dry]] and the Joe Lynn Turner Rainbow era, and you'll find yourself having an enjoyable listen, plus I'd also liked what teaming up with then UFO Keyboard/Guitarist Neil Carter did for Gary Moore's output ([[ASIN:B000HOJBOU Wild Frontier]] and [[ASIN:B000093OU7 Run for Cover]]).<br /><br />Expensive for sure, but perhaps with the recent run of UFO extra-track remasters this too may be added-- so long as folks quit ragging on this one. It's really not that bad.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|It's absolutely disgusting that anyone can even mention this film in the same conversation with Gone with the wind. There is no comparison. It just goes to show that people are more attracted by glitter than by gold.    I won't even go into the fact that a much more interesting picture could have been made using the bare facts of the actual Titanic story. This is an insult to the heroic people who died in the actual sinking.     James Cameron is no David O Selznick (the producer of Gone with the wind, for all you who don't know) and he sure dropped one sizzler of a turd with this abomination. The sad thing is that he cashed in on making a mockery of true historical events by putting them in the shadow of this idiotic tale.    I suppose the actors did what they could with what they had to work with ( which was'nt much ), but the leads were most definitely miscast. The best character in this stinker was the iceberg, and thank God for it!!! It had a much more certain role than any of the so-called \\"stars\\" of this dreadful spectacle, and it did its job with much more style. It was with absolute pleasure that I watched Jack sink into oblivion. That's the one part of the movie that coulda been made longer, watching that clown perish. If only it had happened 2 hours sooner, and if only he had taken Rose with him. These two people were superficial, shallow, and downright tiresome to watch.     In all, an absolutely DISGUSTING display.

I had it on DVD a while back, but had to start my movie collection from scratch (due to a divorce). Bluray is the way to go, even with older movies like these. I'm 110% satsified with this purchase!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I've been enjoying reviewing American history in a well acted series about John Adams.  I haven't read the book but feel the HBO series well depicts the history of a man who was an intregal part of the fight for freedom and independence.  It helped me understand how things transpired during that historical time.  It's incredible what they had to do to make this the free country we now enjoy.
B0017I0KVI|4.0|I enjoyed reading the entire story of Mr. Knightley and Emma's friendship from Mr. Knightley's point of view because people's perspectives change so much depending on who they are.  The things he said about Emma were hilarious and very entertaining.  To be able to see Mr. Knightley's thoughts about what Emma was doing was absolutely delightful at times.  Sometimes I was frustrated with Mr. Knightley because he always jumped to conclusions and was so unfair to Emma in some circumstances.    It was also pleasurable to know what Mr. Knightley was doing even when he was away on vacations.  Mr. Knightley's Diary introduced more of the characters John Knightley (Mr. Knightley's brother) and Isabella (Emma's sister).  It was good to see more of their personalities because they were not mentioned very often in EMMA.    It was interesting to see what Mr. Knightley thought about Mr. Woodhouse.  It was clear that Mr. Knightley sometimes got frustrated with him because he is always so concerned about his and other people's health.      It was intriguing to actually know of Mr. Knightley's feelings toward Frank Churchill.  I was surprised that nice, Mr. Knightley could think and say such mean things towards Frank Churchill all because he thought Emma was falling for him.      Mr. Knightley often met with other women, but his response to them was astounding.  He always tried to arouse his curiosity and see if he could fall in love with them, but we all know he failed.  The only girl he could truly love was Emma.      Mr. Knightley's Diary is well-worth reading if you enjoy the storyline of EMMA.  It is a quick and easy read for Jane Austen fans.

Reading the book is a must because the many examples make the concepts more concrete, but the last chapter is a good quick reference.    I did not buy this book on Amazon because it was an impulse purchase (apparently consistent with my reading habits) and it keeps coming up in my recommendations.  I am curious if doing a review will remove it from that list without treating is non-representative of what I read.

B0014WAC3I|4.0|This movie is really a cute movie. My kids loved seeing it and I remembered how much fun it was to see it at the movies. It is not the best movie I ever saw but it is not the worst either.
B0014BECF8|5.0|I bought this prior to seeing George in concert for the first time in 17 years.  The album is great and if you want to have the time of your life, see him in concert.  He is amazing.  And the great thing is, after the concert you have this wonderful album to help keep the memory alive.
