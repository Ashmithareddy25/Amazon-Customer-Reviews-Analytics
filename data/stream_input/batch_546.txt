B000AGTPUU|3.0|In 1985 sculptor Chris Van Allsburg published his first children's book, THE POLAR EXPRESS, which became an instant classic, especially appropriate for family reading during the holidays.  The beauty of the book was not only a simple story about a lad's discovery of the real meaning of Christmas, but also the power of Allburg's glorious art - which was awarded with the Caldecott Medal in 1986.<br /><br />Some of that book is retained and some of that is lost in this grossly overproduced, extravagantly expensive, film transition of the book.  For reasons only known to director Robert Zemeckis, who also adapted the story for his film, and to his long time friend Tom Hanks, the decision was made to make not just an animated feature and not a computer enhanced film using actors, but a strange amalgamation of the two.  We are seeing puppet-like characters morphed to resemble real people - and that must have caused the animators headaches but earned big money!<br /><br />But despite the bigger than life extravaganza version of basically an intimate story, the theme comes through and the message is sweet.  Whether the 'fillers' heavily frosted on this version are additive is up to the taste of the viewer.  But it is a tour de force for Hanks who plays almost everyone in the film, and it is evident that the film's heart is in the right place.  Grady Harp, November, 05
B000AGTPUA|5.0|This story is very vividely displayed in beautiful animation. It has a real good feel to it, and the voices are warmly done. This is fun for the whole Family.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I never thought Christmas albums could be the real deal.  I love Christmas songs (except for Little Drummer Boy, of course) but they just didn't seem like the kind of covers an artist, at the top of his/her game, would naturally include.  Otherwise, wouldn't you find songs about sleigh bells sprinkled in amongst ones about cold hearts and love-gone-bad?  Is it all obligatory, like the other Christmas trends such as shopping and sending cards?  Is it due to our tendency to not hold Christmas in our hearts all year that after the sun sets December 25th a Christmas CD will gather dust for the next eleven months?      Maybe so, but Diana's new Christmas Songs, I'm willing to bet, won't go down that road.  Irrelevant chestnuts such as \\"Jingle Bells,\\" \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" \\"Sleigh Ride\\" and \\"Let it Snow\\" sparkle with Krall's playful treatment, which includes a couple little surprise lines.  Krall's vocals on this set are some of her most inspired yet.  Maybe a future album will showcase her spectacular musicianship but here, her piano is part of the orchestra, albeit a standout with, among other things, an amazing flourish on \\"Jingle Bells.\\"      Aside from being the only CD where she fronts a big band, what really powers it past New Year's is Diana Krall doing what nobody does better than she: pulling you into her own personal space with the intimacy and deep, rich character of her gorgeous voice.  She has made so many songs her own this way and now \\"Count Your Blessings\\" (which certainly is appropriate any time of year) can be counted among those.  \\"Christmas Time is Here\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" have been there, in my view, since the 1998 import album.  (These are the same versions; \\"Jingle Bells,\\" however, is a fresh cut.)      Certainly, the jacket shows more calf than your average Christmas CD.  But then, this is not an inspirational work in the religious sense.  You get your inspiration your way, I'll get mine my way.  It's probably impossible to produce a photograph of this woman sans sex appeal, so why try?  With a tiny bit of imagination, the   liner photos really suggest a little storyline to \\"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve.\\"
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I am a 19 year old astrologist/tarot reader in training, but have never enjoyed New Age Music that usually accompanies such spiritual meditations.  I saw a commercial for her CD on TV and decided to give it a try, and I am ever so glad I did!  I turned on the music, and LITTERALLY DID NOT MOVE UNTIL THE ENTIRE CD WAS DONE - I sat there and listened to it ALL! The music is THAT amazing!  Her voice is amazing, the songs are of such happiness and sorrow, absolutely amazing!  I am speechless when it comes to this CD... considering I love my dance music and hiphop!  I encourage ANYONE to try this CD, you will love it!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Who thought david gahan and co could still recapture<br /><br />Their greatness of old? Well, with the first notes of \\"precious\\",You will, again, be a believer. I'd tell the newbie that this album Was released in 1985 and no one would notice. Depeche mode's Pop, once again flirts with that cold darkness bands like Xymox Were (in)famous for; a glaring example is the magnificent \\"Lilian\\" Which evokes Xymox's \\"medusa\\", back in 1987. This music gives you<br /><br />the odd feeling of being the only person left in the whole solar system.(okay,<br /><br />I'll have to exempt the second album track; john the revelator).<br /><br />The framing it evokes might very well be a damp, deserted studio with Flickering lights and a tapestry of forlorn canvases. Raindrops collecting Into a tin can... you get the picture. I see some skeptics in the back; would you please listen to \\"the darkest star\\"? This album is already being considered among the best depeche mode, And rightly so: its 12 songs explore everything this trio has always been<br /><br />Excellent at; dancy (as well as gothy, mist-shrouded and slow) tunes with serious hooks and intelligent lyrics to back the Music. The whole comes out brimming with imagery, and that tinge of darkness which can awaken Many a nostalgia.<br /><br />One slight disadvantage (if we may call it so), is the diversity of moods in the songs; I personally cant listen to the entire album in one go. It's not like Listening to Agalloch (now that's an extreme example...), which is a band that has one monolithic Atmosphere Looming over the entire album, making you listen to its entirety, were you in the fitting mood for it.<br /><br />All time fans will be jubilant for that blazing return to shape, while newcomers Can safely pick up this album as their introduction to depeche mode. a 4.5 star album that i recommend. Enjoy!
0553801503|3.0|Most have already heard of how the book was divided.  For those  curious, here's a breakdown of exactly which character POVs and how many chapters of each there are: <br /> <br />Aeron Greyjoy (2) <br />Asha Greyjoy (1) <br />Victarion Greyjoy (2) <br /> <br />Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne (1) <br />Arianne Martell (2) <br />Ser Arys Oakheart (1) <br /> <br />Sansa (3) note: she's listed as both Sansa and Alayne <br />Samwell (5) <br />Jaime (6) <br />Brienne (8) <br />Cersei (10) <br /> <br />As you can see, GRRM was correct in saying he is focusing on King's Landing.  Some people complain of the introduction of new characters, but I think this can be justified by the fact that GRRM has killed off a few of the lead characters in the previous novels and by replacing them, maintains his format of using several POVs to depict an event.  Even though there are one or two chapters for each Greyjoy character (as compared to Cersei's ten) they can be linked together to show the storyline in the area, likewise with Martell.  However, because the shortness of each character's story, there is not as much emotional investment as there are with characters such as Arya, Tyrion, Catelyn, etc.   Personally he could've made this shorter.  I was satisfied with the relative frequency of Asha and Theon's appearances in the previous book and how it was sufficient for describing what was happening with that House.  It was discouraging and boring to read the first chapter (after the prologue) and find out it was about an unfamiliar character.  Also the event with Arianne Martell does not seem necessary and far from significant to this series' history. <br /> <br />It was the most interesting in previous books when Sansa was getting her ideals crushed but now she's just learning a couple of things.  There's a strange tension between her and Petyr that she never addresses, which is frustrating.  Her storyline is one of the slow-paced ones, including Samwell and Brienne.   <br /> <br />GRRM goes the most in depth with Cersei and Jaime.  At first I was rooting against Cersei, but then towards the end, I almost wanted to root for her (this coming from the person who wishes the Coyote would get the Roadrunner every once in awhile).  I love the progression of the change in Jaime's character and especially learning more about his past.   <br /> <br />A compensation for the slow-paced storylines, including Brienne and Samwell, is that a lot of the character's history comes out in flashbacks or reflecting on memories inside the character's head, which I find changes my sympathy and makes the character a more conflicted persona.  That, and as a previous reviewer said, the lack of exciting events can be due to the lull in the wars, relatively speaking, and people are dealing with the aftermath etc.  However, I'm disappointed that when Arya is mostly shoved away doing her training, there could've been more detail, small events that she goes through and learns something. <br /> <br />Anyways, the intrigue is still there (though mostly with Cersei), the writing style is still there, but the pace has slowed with the focus more on the development of the characters themselves than the events.  I still enjoyed reading the book, and after a few chapters, it was hard to put down.  Definately for fans, just try not to make your expectations high (though it probably won't be after reading reviews) as well as try not to focus on what you're missing.  I don't recommend anyone new to this series to start anywhere but the very first book, A Game of Thrones. <br /> <br />Note: In the previous book, there was a shocking cliffhanger with Catelyn and I'm really disappointed that in this book, he didn't go very far with it--in fact he barely touches on it.
B00005JL0I|1.0|No wonder Peter Sellers walked out on this film. I did as well.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|LET SERJ SING.  Hmm.  Lets see, SOAD WAS one of the great upcoming bands of this decade.  Unique and powerful, but then something happened.  Daron, the great guitarist, decided that he needed to control the band and sing too.  Now lets take a look at other great bands:  Did Jimmy Page sing?  Nope Robert Plant did.  How about Slash?  Why bother, Axl was there.  Eddy Van Halen, hell he had Roth and Haggar.  Angus Young, nope, not him either.  See the point is that all these great axemen realized that in addition to the incredible guitar playing they provided the band, that the ultimate \\"instrument\\"  unique to their band was the fact that they had an incredible lead singer with a sound unlike any other.  They accepted it and the bands thrived.  But SOAD will end up crashing and burning because DARON wants all the control.  Look at the liner notes on the last 2 albums, Hypnotize and Mesmerize.  He writes the songs and the lyrics, and even produces.  His fingerprints are all over this piece of crap.  On the first 3 albums, which were incredible, Daron harmonize with Serj, but overall Serj was the voice of SOAD.  Now, Daron, the egomaniac, has to sing with his whiney little voice, and even overpowers Serj on the harmonies.  I am so disgusted with this so called \\"double CD.\\"  It's pathetic that an album of so-called B-sides could be better than this.  Stick to the old stuff people, don't buy this, don't waste your money, and don't destroy your own personal image of what this band was and what we all thought they could become.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|this is one of the most important albums soad have ever realeased with the sucess of mezmerize they need to produce another album of good songs to show the world just how good they are theyve done that with songs like attack dreaming kill rock n roll hypnotise and the allmight holy mountains witch rivals even mettalica for epic song writing it is full of great melodies hard hitty rythums anthemic choruses catchy riffs the lot in alot of there songs there is a change in dynamics witch realli hits you since the change happens so smoothly u just didnt see it coming great album and a must have for all music fans <br />   <br />so far how id rate em  <br /> <br />system of a down 9.8/10  <br /> <br />toxicity 10/10 <br /> <br />steal this album 9/10 <br /> <br />mesmerize 8.5/10  <br /> <br />hypnotise 10/10
B000BM6AVA|2.0|Wow all i have to say is I miss the old System of a Down. Mezmerize and Hypnotize are two huge let downs. Serj is a great singer but they decide to let Daron add his whiney vocals to the tracks. Back up vocals don't bother me but when he is singing full songs or lends the majority of his vocals on a songs I wan't to cry. With the exception of Lonely Day my favorite song on the album(Daron sings the entire song and it actually isn't that bad, Serj could have made it better though.), Holy Mountain, and Soldiers Side the rest of the songs are just horrible. If Korn's new album is as horrible as Mezmerize or Hypnotize I will completely give up on the Nu-Metal genre.
B000BGH22W|5.0|While I too love John Williams, I think Patrick Doyle's talents are well suited to GoF.  He's great at pageant-like grand entrances (listent to \\"Foreign Visitors Arrive\\") and at Elgar-style dirges (listen to \\"Another Year Ends,\\" which I think is actually a funeral hymn for Cedric, and \\"Hogwarts Hymn\\" -- very Elgarian).  The opening bars of the movie will remind some listeners of \\"Mars, Bringer of War\\" from Holst's \\"The Planets.\\" <br /> <br />As to the Jarvis Cocker pop cuts at the end, I thank the previous reviewers for their guidance as to what genres these belong to.  To me, they're lots of fun, but the main point remains with Doyle's swelling anthem-tunes and orchestral wizardry.
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|Doubtless, Nolan has reinvigorated the Batman franchise. Warner Brothers gambled on this production and was hugely successful. Who knows if Nolan will continue to direct but doubtless Caine, Freeman, and Bale will continue to play their roles. They've been given very good scripts, very good characters, and guaranteed box office. That is the hat-trick that all actors crave. Batman Begins should have a very significant effect on the genre itself. Where comic book movies have begun to falter very badly--we were given a very good example of such faltering movies in The Fantastic Four playing this very summer--Nolan has shown us how a such a movie can be successful. Certainly, future movies in this sub-genre will be encouraged to explore similar \\"dark and adult themes\\" in their scripts. What will be interesting to see is if Hollywood can tear itself away from the setting of the comic book world and begin to explore new concepts in speculative settings that don't have agendas, scripts, and characters ready-made. Could Batman Begins have been successful under a different title and a different name? We think so. In fact, the thought of a movie where a troubled man begins to take justice in to his own hands with the implicit cooperation of elements within the justice department would have a profound resonance in this day and age of terrorism. Or, it could follow in the footsteps of M. Night Shyamalan's excellent movie Unbreakable where the thought of becoming a comic book hero in real terms has real consequences and real misgivings. Truly, watched together, Unbreakable and Batman Begins share similar elements and differ only in that one invokes a heritage and one inherits a bequest. Will Nolan show Hollywood the path to reinvigorating movie production in general? We can only pray it is so... <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD SEE <br /> <br />The box office take for this movie was wildly successful. Certainly, enthusiasts of Spider Man, prior Batman films, Superman, and all the host ofother comic book movies will be astonished at the scope and daring of this movie as compared to others. Fans of Burton's first Batman film who felt rather lost and abandoned in the subsequent three films will find the return to roots and adult plotting refreshing. Movie audiences that relish psychological conflict as much as they relish physical conflict will find a great deal within this movie that will excite their craving for suspense.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD PASS <br /> <br />This is a movie that requires a deal of immersion and patriotism towards the genre itself. People who approach these more speculative elements with a great deal of suspicion tinged with a bit of contempt will not enjoy this film. A suspension of some disbelief is required despite Nolan's efforts at creating realistic spectacle. This is precisely true because the characters are symbolic and the themes are familiar archetypes... for subtle shadings of grey, the viewer will have to seek elsewhere. Gotham City is, after all, not a real place and that will irritate some viewers. Equally, people looking finally for something different in this genre of comic book movies will be disappointed; it is different in craft but it is still very emphatically a comic book movie. It is a comic book movie done exceptionally well but still a comic book movie. People seeing this film only because they are fans of Katie Holmes will probably be disappointed with her performance. Younger children will probably not enjoy this film, be terrified of some elements of it, and not understand a great deal. Parents should take the 13 in the PG-13 rating very, very seriously. Take young kids to see Spider Man 2 and The Fantastic Four.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
B000AL730O|5.0|There I was, listening the album, punching the button to the <br />next song to find something \\"good.\\" <br />Silence. Nothing good(?) I decided to listen to every song <br />in their entirety. Boy was I hit in the head. This is great <br />stuff. But it is not rocking Paul. Nor is it soft Paul. <br />It is melancholy Paul. Each song has a sweet bitterness <br />of happiness and loneliness. Think of Mother Nature's Son, <br />Blackbird, The Lovely Linda, type songs. This is the kind of album you listen to on <br />a long drive by yourself on the way to a loved one. <br />Someone who you need tell \\"I love you\\" more often. <br />This is the kind of album to be listened to on the <br />way home from visiting a loved one. Someone that you <br />find dear and may not be near much more. <br />When I listened to this album on my long, lonely commute <br />home, boy it hits you hard. Especially the last 7 songs. <br />For someone my age, 45, it is uncanny listening to Paul <br />after 40 years. And still a big fan. I can say I have <br />been a fan since I was 4 years old. Paul has turned chaos <br />into creation. <br />
B000B8QF00|5.0|Well, i'd like to start by saying how much i love this album. It's just great, you can find alanis' best songs in here, well not all her best songs but most of them. It's a great collection. All the tracks in the cd are good, except for one or two, but the rest is outstanding. The new song \\"Crazy\\" is a great cover, I love the song and the Video. There is an error on the amazon track list. Number six is not hands clean, number six is Ironic. and The original hands clean is number 13.<br /><br />My favorite Songs are:<br /><br />Thank You<br /><br />Head Over Feet<br /><br />8 easy steps<br /><br />everything<br /><br />crazy<br /><br />ironic<br /><br />you learn<br /><br />simple together<br /><br />that i would be good<br /><br />sister blister<br /><br />hands clean<br /><br />mercy<br /><br />still<br /><br />let's do it (one of my favorites, it has an old style but sounds great)<br /><br />and hand in my pocket.<br /><br />Besides all these great tracks, there is some lines written by alanis, and the lyrics for all the songs. What else can i ask for uhh??<br /><br />Well, there is one song that i love and it's missing... \\"Offer\\" and i would have loved to see Hands Clean Acoustic in here, but besides that i love this album.<br /><br />This is mostly for non hardcore fans, but for casual fans since a hardcore fan already has most of the tracks in here. Buy it, it's totally worth it. Trust me on this one.
B0000027D5|5.0|I got the vinyl Lotus album when I was about 15 (a long time ago!).  I paid a hell of a lot for the Japanese import.  I never regretted it.  This is still one of my favorite albums.  There are a lot of extended jazz-like tunes.  If you don't like this type of music then don't by this album.  However, if you want to hear Carlos at his feedback-frenzied, screaming guitar best, get this CD - it is absolutely amazing. <br /> <br />Freddie
B000000OF6|5.0|Queen is one of my favorite rock bands that I just can't get enough of. I think that they're better than the beatles and equal to the rolling stones. DON'T BUY QUEEN GREATEST HITS. I mean, it has most of their good songs but is missing bohemian rhapsody. Are they nuts? This CD is more costly but is the best Queen collection out there.  <br />Here is my list of their best songs (all on this CD!): <br />We Will Rock You- Great beat that they play at bball games. Whenever I hear it, I feel like standing up and dancing.  <br />Bohemian Rhapsody-their best song. Flawless. <br />Under Pressure-Great song <br />I Want to Break Free-This is the song that was on that coca cola commercial. So awesome <br />Another One Bites the Dust-Classic. I love it. <br />Killer Queen-Crazy, tight song <br />We are the Champions-Not my fave but still 100% classic essential Queen <br />Somebody to Love-Slower song..sensational..one of the best <br /> <br />That is a shortened list as their hits go on. Queen is an unbelievable band with some one hit wonders you'll never forget. Bohemian Rhapsody is one of the best songs I have ever heard. It goes from slow to fast to CRAZY and back to slow. <br />A must own album. Essential.
B0007GAERG|1.0|OMG, have you seen how many one star reviews this album is getting lately!? Well, I can tell you, there's a good reason for that. The reason is, Mariah is a cash-in and her songs are bland.  <br /> <br />I don't recommend any of Mariah's music to anyone. And insulting Madonna isn't working - she shouldn't write her off, the silly [...].
B00005JOGU|5.0|I came into this movie not knowing anything about Truman Capote. I left the theater and bought In Cold Blood. That is what this movie did to me. That obviously shows that this movie was so good that it motivated me to buy Capote's book.  <br />Similiar to the way Ray presented Ray Charles, this movie does also show a lot of his negative aspects. His main problem: lying. All the time.  <br />Truman Capote is played with such remarquable conviction by Philip Seymour Hoffman that he deserves best actor. Amazing! So, this movie should 100% win best actor and maybe even best picture.  <br />The movie shows only one section of Capote's life, the part where he wrote his most popular book, In Cold Blood. Here, Capote decided to write a book on the \\"massacre\\" in Kansas in 1959. He goes along with Harper Lee, the wonderful author of To Kill a Mockingbird. It is shown how Lee is dissrespected by people...the author of a \\"kiddy book\\".  <br />When the killers of the Kansas family are found, Truman meets with one of them on a regular basis and forms a bond with him.  <br />But then, Truman starts lying a lot and hurting his \\"friend\\".  <br /> <br />Capote is a wonderful movie about the life of fame of a man..and shows the lenghts he will go to to get the job done. <br />It is a crowning achievement, tied with A History of Violence for the best of the year. So please, watch this amazing movie..a true masterpiece with one of the best performances I have ever seen by any actor. Philip Seymour Hoffman is surreal. His high pitched voice is almost freaky and he has wonderfully represented the real Capote from what I can see. A brilliant must see.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions is currently #1 on the Top 200, with over 344,000 copies sold. The album also shot into the pole position in twenty-four other countries, and sold 3.6 million worldwide in its first week. Beat that, Mariah! <br /> <br />Hung Up is also currently enjoying chart success, at #7.  <br />Hung Up chronology: #20-21-27-14-7...
B000002MY3|5.0|Jagged Little Pill is one of those rare CDS where you can play EVERY song on the CD and enjoy it. Normally when you buy a CD, it's only for a couple good songs or one good one you heard one on the radio. But this CD has so many good songs that it's crazy. That's exactly why i reminds me of the best album of all time...Weezer: the blue album, in which ever song is flawlessly executed. <br />This CD is harsh and some of the songs are brutal but it is one sweet CD. The songs are so tight and you'll just want to listen to them over and over and over.  <br /> <br />Alanis' Morisette is a brillinat CD full with amazing songs with awesome beats. My faves are Hand in my Pocket, All I Really Want, You Oughta Know and You Learn.  <br />This CD is unreal and is a must own. And as I listen to it right now, I am singing along with the music because it's so amazing. The CD is also powerful with some sensational songs.  <br />So if you like music at all and like rock, this is THE CD to own. If you like rock, buy this and Weezer: the blue album and you'll be in for one hell of an evening. The only difference is that most Weezer songs are silly while some of these songs here are sad and true.  <br />So please check this gem out, one of the best CDs ever...what I consider to trully be a CD masterpiece.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Jeeeeeeeesus Christ. The Emancipation Of Mimi has travelled up the charts eleven places this week from 15 to 4 because people bought this trash (cash-in). Madonna's new album still got number 1, buy that instead.
B000002HJA|3.0|Compared to Kyuss past releases, this just doesnt measure up. <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I have read some negative press about this album, as well as Mezmerize, in some of the major music mags, most notably Rolling Stone.  The biggest beef the RS reviewer had was that the album was released in two installments when it was, in fact, within the time limit for just one CD.  He probably felt like it was some kind of marketing BS, System screwing you out of your money kind of a thing. <br /> <br />Well, I for one rather enjoyed waiting to get \\"the rest of the story.\\"  To me, System is the pinnacle in music today, and I always look forward to their next release, which have consistenly gotten more and more amazing since their self-titled debut.  It's an awesome feeling to finally get an album on its release date, but it's also a letdown, because you know it could be years before you will get a new gift from your favorite band.  I thought it was cool to know I would be getting a new gift from System in such a short time, and I must say, it was worth the wait. <br /> <br />Perhaps, as the RS reviewer seemed to be so adamant about, either piece of the Mez/Hyp puzzle is NOT the greatest album of the year.  But after I bought Hypnotize and burned the tracks from both albums consecutively onto one CD, I was able to really appreciate the immensity of the accomplishment.  It is 23 tracks over 76 minutes, and every single track is at least good, and most of them are great.  I mean, how often these days does a 76 minute album come out with this much quality material?  It is obvious that System dug deep and pulled out all the stops while writing the songs on this album.  Even the worst song (in my opinion) on Mez/Hyp, \\"Lonely Day,\\" is only bad when taken in context of all that came before it.   <br /> <br />Some of the reviews that I have read have compared System to Slipknot, both bands seemingly inhabiting the same genre.  It seems ludicrous to categorize a band like System when the closest comparison that can be made is Slipknot.  System defies genre categorization, often inhabiting several differnt genres over the course of the same song.  For example, the disco/funk (!) sections in \\"Vicinity of Obscenity.\\"  There is a delicacy and articulation to System's approach that is lost in a band like Slipknot.   <br /> <br />I have read a surprising amount of groaning about Daron's singing.  I say surprising because Daron has been singing since the first album.  He was all over \\"Toxicity\\" and I don't remember anyone complaining about it then.  Personally, I think Daron has a great voice, and the fact that his vocal presence has increased means that the band is coming to terms with its musical potential, and are using every tool available to them.  Most of the harmonies and vocal parts in Mez/Hyp are simply amazing, and to think that the band is worse off because of this richer, more complex vocal sound is just dumb.   <br /> <br />The RS reviewer said that you could \\"hear the sound of wheels turning\\" at the end of \\"Hypnotize,\\" presumably in songs like \\"Vicinity of Obscenity,\\" and the above mentioned \\"Lonely Day.\\"  System is not always serious, as any fan knows.  Some are their songs are indeed, quite silly.  \\"Sugar,\\" \\"Bounce!,\\" and \\"Chik-N-Stu\\" were also rather silly songs.  This vein of silliness has been running through System albums since the beginning.  If they only sang of heavy political issues, they would become pompous. <br /> <br />I think that every System album has gotten progressively more amazing than the last one.  The first album blew me away when it came out, and then \\"Toxicity\\" was such an improvement over the first album.  And then \\"Steal This Album!\\" was such an amazing leap from \\"Toxicity,\\" and now \\"Mezmerize/Hypnotize\\" brings System into a whole new realm.   While \\"Steal This Album!\\" hinted at the brilliance that was to come with Mez/Hyp, I could not have conceived that 4 men could create such complex, weird, funny, and even beautiful music.  If the pattern of each album trumping the last continues, it absolutely boggles my mind to imagine what the next System album will be like.  I can't wait.
B00005T30L|5.0|This is a film that made a strong impression on me, partially because it is a great coming of age story, and partially because the performances were flawless, but mainly because it was so realistic. The characters are so well developed it is difficult to imagine they are fictional. <br /> <br />  Enid is the perfect angsty teenager - unpleasant, sarcastic and lonely. Her determination to be an individual leaves her virtually friendless and unemployable as she alienates herself from everyone she encounters. Her fascination with Seymour, the pathetic middleaged record collector (perfectly played by Buscemi - this is what you call good acting), is her only distraction. <br /> <br />  Although not a \\"comedy\\" as such, Ghost World has many funny moments; I personally found Enid's art teacher to be very amusing...it's quite an accurate portrayal (well, my art teacher shares her views anyway). Whilst Enids many catty comments have a bitter twist to them, she is a witty commentator on modern life. <br /> <br />  I found the beginning of the film grating the first time I watched it - the characters were a bit too \\"cool\\" - but by the end I was utterly captivated. The more I've seen Ghost World the more it moves me each time; the characters are so interesting and human its hard not to grow to love them despite (or because) of their various faults. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is great too, featuring some good punk and blues tracks. <br /> <br />This film is definatly worth buying, as it is one that gets better every time you watch it.
0316236535|5.0|I have two kids (ages 3 and 18 mos) who adore this book!  Not only do they love to tell the monster to go away, they have also learned all the parts of the face as well.  The love to touch their nose and their hair when the Big Green Monster's appears and we always growl when the teeth appear.  I use it quite a bit in my son's toddler playgroup and haven't met a kid who didn't get involved with it.  Truly a great book!
B000BM6AVA|3.0|I'm pretty sure System of a Down new they could pull this double album thing off and rake in the money and screw us over, essentially.  But hey, who has a problem with more SOAD music.  On the other hand, there are probly 4-5 tracks on both Hypnotize and Mezmerize, that we could do without.  The obvious and logical solution to me would be to release a brilliant album with the tightest songs from both these albums.  But of course, that doesn't make sense economically, but i dont care, they are artists, not greedy bastards, I'm sure they got enuff to last em.  I suggest that SOAD gets back to some of their roots from their self-titled stuff and chill out on the thrashing, 2 minute, ridiculously crazy, while kinda cool, tracks.  I love it when they slow it down, get ominous, put some feeling into it instead of sounding like straight heavy guitar puking.  Revenga, Lost in Hollywood and Soldier Side are brilliant pieces of music, i would love to see a 12-15 track album that blends together a bit tighter and has a thematic feel too it.  Steal This Album was supposed to be their album with just a bunch of basically studio rejects, and it was sick, but Mezmerize and Hypnotize felt like brilliance mixed in with that same, and even less appealing, studio reject shtuff. PEACE
B000AOEN2C|5.0|This is my husband's Christmas gift that he got for Thanksgiving. His eyes lite up like a little kid's, this is the best of the whole Star Trek saga. Even I'm enjoying these. It's got drama and comedy. If you can get it, you should, it's the best.
B00008RH1H|3.0|I purchased \\"Throne of Blood\\" from one of the other listed sellers. It is clearly an asian version (though it plays on U.S. systems), it says \\"BoYing\\" on a corner, . The print quality is just O.K. but the sub-titles and other english translations are not the usual bad but are atrocious. I don't know if the Criterion Edition is better, perhaps someone who reads this review and has a Criterion Edition can comment. If it is better, spend the extra money and do not get the BoYing version. This is acceptable only if nothing better is available.
B00005JO1J|5.0|Although I have never seen Rent on Broadway, I fell in love with the music online. I had to see the movie. It is beautiful and touching. It makes you smile, laugh, cry, and dance all in two hours. It has a deep meaning hiding in the beautiful music and wonderful acting. The camera shots are amazing, as are the vocals. Very well directed. Best picture nomination should be considered for this gorgeous film.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Hypnotize is a good follow-up to the 2 disc package.  I have been a SOAD fan since their first cd came out some years ago.  As soon as the cd starts w/Attack I was like oh my God!  Fast and very thrashy.  Next track Dreaming, same thing.  These 2 tracks are some of the heaviest and fastest songs the band has ever done, easily.  They are brutal.  But than the cd starts to kinda go downhill, has a few peeks and then really falls by the wayside towards the end.  One thing that is different on this cd is that it's not as catchy as Mezmerize, some parts/songs are fillers on this cd.  The other part, kinda big for me, is on this cd Every song has some sort of ballad/mellow/slow part.  I am all about time changes, and for the first 2 tracks I am o.k. w/this because, despite the mellow parts, these songs are serious thrashers.  However why did they decide to do this on every song, having a heavy song from beginning to end is o.k. guys, you don't have to mellow every friggin' song.  I mean you start getting into the heavy parts and then boom, this mellow part takes the steam out of the rest of the song.  SOAD have proven they can make awesome heavy songs from beginning to end, why they would try this new format on every song does not work.  The last 2 songs are real throwaways.  I mean Lonely Day has Daron singing for the majority of the track and he is actually trying to sing.  The problem is Daron is not a good singer, never really has been.  I always liked how he would interject some parts on all past releases, but w/Mezmerize and Hypnotize it is definitly the Daron show.  Serj is the Man.  He has the unique voice that makes this band stand out.  And the one good thing is Daron is less prevalent on this, unlike Mezmerize, however he still sings alot more than past SOAD releases.  Soldier side closes the cd out, in a good tie-in to Mezmerize, but this is another real slow plodding/boring tune like Lonely Day.  Some other standout tracks are U-Fig, the entertaining Vicinityof Obscenity (back to ridiculous/fun lyrics), She's like Heroin.  As I said the cd is really good, except for some of those mentinoed parts.  The other cool thing is how the cd fits together w/Mezmerize to form a double cd.  Best packaging of any cd of 2005.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush really epitomizes the raw creative power that happens when the band has collaborative synergy. I mean is there really more to say about this? The band members stand out on their own talents but it comes together as a whole. \\"Moving Pictures\\" is one of those \\"must-have\\" rock CDs, a la \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" or \\"Boston\\".
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Once again System of a Down presents to us another original and interesting album of material.  As you probably know, this is the sequel to the critically-acclaimed Mesmerize which arrived earlier this year in May.  Because these two albums are supposed to form a double album, they are pretty similar.  However, Hypnotize is a bit superior.  While Mesmerize's high spots are higher than Hypnotize (ex: Question!), Hypnotize is more consistent.  Unlike Mesmerize, Hypnotize doesn't drag on about something like Hollywood's corruption.  Instead, each song builds upon the album, creating a truly unique experience.  By this point, I don't really mind and in fact enjoy the vocals of Daron (the guitarist) and they seem to complement Serj's vocals better (even though I'd prefer Serj alone).  The drumming seems a bit more heavy and fast.  The bass-work is pretty similar to Mesmerize.  And I think the guitar-work is actually a bit better with several guitar solos on this album (ex: Lonely Day, Soldier Side).  Stand-outs include Dreaming, a dark and heavy track, Kill Rock 'n Roll, a very catchy song whose title seems to be relevant to the modern music scene, the title track, which is the first single and shows how well Daron and Serj's vocals complement each other, Holy Mountains, which is kind of like a System of a Down epic which describes the Armenian genocide, and Soldier Side, one of my favorites which is beautiful, melodic, and is the sequel to Soldier Side (intro) from Mesmerize.  Overall, one of the best releases of 2005 and a welcome addition to System of a Down's discography.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Could there be any band that embodies rock epics more than Rush? \\"Xanadu\\" was the very first Rush song I heard, and it remains at the top of my favorite Rush songs. Close behind is \\"Cygnus X-1\\", the tale of a space voyager traveling through a black hole. (Scientific fact: Cygnus X-1 IS believed to be the first black hole discovered -- it was deteced in the early seventies by orbiting X-ray telescopes; Rush practically smmed up what science knew about these mysterious objects.) The shorter, radio-friendly tracks are all worthy of course; but they can easily be overlooked when sanwiched between \\"Xanadu\\" and \\"Cygnus X-1\\". This is a Rush essential!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I have been a Enya fan since a Day without rain. After that I bought Paint the Sky with Stars and the \\"Enya Collection\\" (I did not have the other cds so this was a great idea for me).  <br />I bought Amarantine the same day it was on sale and I hear it everytime, I love it!!! In my opinion this is her best work yet. <br /> <br />I am very happy with this work. \\"It's in the rain\\" and \\"Long Long Journey\\" are very Enya style and my favorites. The new language, Loxian is amazing and The River Sings proved that she can sing \\"dance\\" songs. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Amarantine, you will not going to regret it.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I followed Pink Floyd on \\"The Division Bell\\" tour through all of their California dates, and those concerts were among the happiest moments in my life. No joking -- Floyd took me on an inrcedible journey. It was an ethereal, almost un-Earthly journey: the moment they opened with \\"Astronomy Domine\\"; ended the first half with the incredible inflateable pigs in \\"One Of These Days\\"; began the second half with a visual trip through space with \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\"; and...well, basically everything else. I'm not a big fan of concert DVDs, but this will be a must-have. No doubt, this will leave me wanting to see it again and again.
B000063DFN|5.0|Why would I say the above about this release from the Boys of London?  Because this album rocks, shocks, makes you think, dream, collide with the rest of the universe as no other piece of music can.  There are no separated highlights; every song is a solid monster statement.  The title track is an incredible piece of both writing and performing.  The most amazing part of all is that they were able to pull off their music live with even more presence and power than they mustered in the studio!    <br /> <br />Then there is Maiden's Magnum Opus, 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner.'  This \\"song\\" solidified them as the \\"Yes\\"of Heavy Metal.  It put them on a plane that few other bands in rock, let alone metal bands, can ever or will ever approach.  Get this cd, and listen to the great Steve Harris play the bass like it's an out of control missile.  He is lyrical and powerful; and the rest of the band doesn't miss a beat.  Bruce Dickenson never sounded better.   <br /> <br />Although I will always love their first album and 'Killers' with Paul Dianno, and 'Number of the Beast' and 'Piece of Mind' which followed, it is 'Powerslave' that is their most essential recording.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|I love Diana and her voice.  But this outing doesn't do it for me.  I prefer her being out in front like on Love Scenes or When I Look in You Eyes.  To me her previous big band outing, Look of Love, suffered in the same way -- great photos, weak rhythm.  She just sounds too constrained to me when she's following the big band.  I don't know how they recorded this, but if the recorded the strings before Diana's voice, my suggestion would be to record Diana and a small combo first, and THEN record the strings.  Let her swing a bit.  Let her follow her own beat.  Don't tie her down!  Let the people in the monkey suits follow her, not vice-versa.  While Beethoven and Bach may have allowed improvision in classical music, classical musicians forgot how to swing and improvise a couple hundred years ago!
B00005JNX0|3.0|Long ago, before this movie was even in threaters, I saw some commercials for it and I admit that I was excited. At the time, Pixar was kicking ass and taking names. They made some incredible animated movies. Not merely that, but other companies were getting in on it and I enjoyed some of the other companies' efforts, such as Ice Age. <br /> <br />So I thought that maybe Madagascar would be as enjoyable. In the end, it wasn't nearly so, but it is still fairly good. <br /> <br />The main problem with this movie is that it isn't immersive. What made Pixar's creations so enjoyable was how well you could feel the characters' emotions. In Madagascar, however, the movie allocates far too little time to character development for this to occur. <br /> <br />For example, the two main characters of the movie is Alex and Marty. We know that Marty is unhappy with his condition at the NY zoo, but Alex and the others seem perfectly happy. Why is this? What is giving Marty these emotions of emptiness? He experienced the same thing that his friends experienced because they're together all the time, so what set in these emotions for Marty? What kind of personality does he have that allows him to have these emotions? <br /> <br />And this is exactly what I'm talking about. You never discover the personalities of the characters, not even the main characters. Instead, the directors gave them generic emotions. We all know they love each other and they wouldn't purposely hurt each other, but we don't know what makes them run. We never discover what lies deep inside of them, what makes them who they are. <br /> <br />Of course, however, I may be attempting to find depth in a movie that was created merely for entertainment. Pixar may have spoiled me with the unbelievably well crafted Finding Nemo. <br /> <br />Anyway, though, to get to the point, I do enjoy this movie somewhat. Unlike most who seems to like the penguins, though, I actually like the interaction between Julien, Maurice, andMort the most, though. I personally thought that was the high point of the movie. <br /> <br />If you're looking to watch this movie, it may work better as a rent than a buy.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|With all of their past albums, System has changed their style from album to album, but maintaining their SOAD quirkeyness at the same time. This formula, in my opinion, has never failed them. Hypnotize is a great album if you can appreciate art, as that is exactly what this album is. Most people and music fans could fall in love with their older albums, but not this one. Hypnotize, with the exception of a few tracks, is a brand new System, with sound expirmentation taken to its furthest limits. If you were to listen to any of the music from this album, it is undoubtedly SOAD, but its different. Really, you have to be a System fan, or just listen to it to understand where I am coming from. Overall, another great release by SOAD. 5 of 5!
B000BHN7DE|5.0|Anastacia is one of the most successful international artists. Born in Chicago, it is perhaps ironic that she is better known in other parts of the world. Indeed this is an irony; hundreds of thousands of people who encounter Anastacia's music assume she is British, maybe French or perhaps German. The reality is that this phenomenal dance/pop artist is as American as American gets - and it is a great disappointment not to see her recognized as such by her fellow countrymen and women. However, it is true that Anastacia's music initially struck a cord with European audiences: American's would not be familiarized with her until her 2002 Las Vegas Divas Live performance and the subsequent American release of \\"Freak of Nature\\", Anastacia's second studio album. Nevertheless, globally - Anastacia is one of the most sought after dance/pop acts. The proof of course are these two CD's filled with all of her greatest hits, remixed and revisited. For anyone still unintroduced to this great lady, this collection of songs, spanning six years of her successful career is especially essential. In addition to the twelve hits on CD 1 (extracted from \\"Not that Kind\\", \\"Freak of Nature\\", and \\"Anastacia\\") are four new songs and a club megamix...An evaluation here follows: <br /> 1) I'm Outta Love (10/10) this started her career, great song <br /> 2) Not that Kind (8/10) slightly weaker but still a hit <br /> 3) Cowboys & Kisses (8/10) very nice song, i love the name. <br /> 4) Made for lovin' You (9/10) i love the production...makes you want to dance... <br /> 5) Paid My Dues (10/10) one of my favorites, good breakup song <br /> 6) One Day In Your Life (10/10) what a hit, absolutely love it <br /> 7) Why'd You Lie to Me (10/10) another great dance hit... <br /> 8) You'll Never Be Alone (9/10) great ballad, strong vocals <br /> 9) Left Outside Alone (10/10) very popular with the clubs <br />10) Sick and Tired (10/10) the production here is awesome! <br />11) Welcome to my Truth (10/10) very uplifting/positive track <br />12) Heavy on my Heart (10/10) the absolute BEST ballad from Anastacia. <br />13) Everything Burns (10/10) great duet <br />14) I Belong To You (10/10) half Italian/half English, great, passionate lyrics. <br />15) Pieces of a Dream (10/10) love it... <br />16) In Your Eyes (8/10) a slightly weaker ballad <br />17) Club Megamix (8/10) I wish it could include more hits in a shorter version, this one is like eleven minutes long..(needs editing)
B00005JO1P|5.0|I have been a Johnny Cash fan ever since I've been born. My grandfather has met Johnny Cash in person, and I've been a huge fan. If you are a Johnny Cash or June Carter fan you shold see this movie. Joaquin Phoenix and Resse Witherspoon are great actors to portray Johnny and June. In the movie there are songs such as: Jackson, Long legged Guitar Pickin Man, Folsom Prison Blues and a lot more famous songs that Johnny Cash wrote.
0307276902|5.0|i am not generally a fan of oprah's book picks, but i happened to stumble upon a video she and her colleagues had put together and aired on her website.  the video highlighted how a copy of A MILLION LITTLE PIECES had been passed from one person to another--how the energy of the book passed through the hands and hearts of the readers, both men and women, and spread like wild fire.  everyone on the video had been so impacted by what they'd read that my curiosity got the best of me and i went out and bought the book.   <br /> <br />it is like no other i have ever read.  james frey, former drug addict, writes as if he is a poet.  his clever choice of writing style artistically yet realistically portrays the struggles he faces throughout his story.  <br /> <br />i truly found myself getting sucked in and caring deeply for james and his friends.  i could not help but wonder how many of frey's characters and how much of the story was actually real. <br />i just found the whole thing fascinating, grateful for being an outsider looking in.   <br /> <br />since i have finished the book, it has been passed on, and the list of who wants it next seems to be coming endless.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Released in 1995, Richard Linklater's \\"Before Sunrise\\" became a Generation X romantic masterpiece. It was the story of the one night spent together by chatty, heartbroken American drifter Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and vulnerable but opinionated French girl Celine (Julie Delpy). Walking around Vienna, they talked, making out with their minds, before falling in love.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, they promise to meet up in Vienna six months later. Instead, the sequel \\"Before Sunset\\" opens nine years later in Paris. Due to the death of her grandmother, Celine never made it back to Vienna. The next time she meet's Jesse is in a bookstore, where he is winding up the end of a book tour. He has written a novel based on their time in Vienna, and although at first speechless, soon both have a lot to talk about.<br /><br />The movie unfolds in real time over 80 minutes. As they leave the bookstore on the left bank of the Seine, the sinking of the sun is an element of time. Letting you know how much time they have left.<br /><br />Instead of filming the landmarks of Paris of Vienna, director Linklater show us wide shots, in front of or behind the couple. The streetscapes are pretty, and they make the time go faster. Building the suspense of the story.<br /><br />Celine and Jesse are hungry for news of each other. He feels trapped in his loveless marriage because of having a child. She is tired of been the kind of women who men thank for teaching them how to love other women. Delpy is hypersensitive about the deadline, punctuating her thoughts with \\"You'll miss your plane.\\"<br /><br />Neither Delpy nor Hawke has done anything as effective since \\"Before Sunrise.\\" Hawke has been the occasional success like \\"Training Day.\\" Delpy's career has crashed and burned. Here, both off camera contributing to writing the script, as well as on screen, they work so well together you wonder why the film took so long to get made.<br /><br />The subject they talk about most is how in their mid-30s, they realise how precious time is. That regret is wasteful, and passion is always compromised by real life. In an 80-minute long epiphany they remind each other what by not again meeting again in Vienna, they learnt to live without.<br /><br />But they are talking again. With seductive ease, they navigate the new terrain of each other's heart. Feeling they're rhythmic beat, you hope for them time will stand still.their mid-30s, they realise how precious time is.

B000002U9E|5.0|Anything I could possibly add to what other reviewers have written would be superfluous. The greatest album ever recorded.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|I found the diversity of previous reviews most interesting.  All of the songs on this recording are very familiar Christmas songs.  I found the arrangements to be good, and enjoyed the fact that Diana's voice was clear and not covered up by the orchestration.  I am always disappointed by recordings that use up only a fraction of the capacity of a CD -- in this case, 45 minutes.  I don't think we pay only 60% of the price.  I would have liked at least one or two less common songs.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd is awesome. its a lot more mellow than their old cds too. but joey jordison is the best drummer in world. his solo at the end of circle is one of my favorite parts on the cd. here are my thoughts on the songs: <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0: 8/10 not one my favorites but a goog song nonetheless <br />The Blister Exists: 11/10 i love this song the guitar, particulary Pauls, is sweet <br />Three Nil: 9/10 the beggining when Joey htis the drums and the guitar starts is tight <br />Duality: 11/10: My favorite of all. The song does sound a bit better on the 9.0 Live cd, but its still awesome <br />Opium of the People: 10/10 awesome. the part where corey says idiosycranies is wierd though <br />circle: 10/10 really suprising. i realy like this song and the drum solo at the end is freekin awesome <br />welcome: 9/10 i mainly like the drum and guitar at the beggining <br />vermilion: 8/10 i dont like this song that much but its okay <br />pulse of the maggots: 9/10 i dont get why everyone says this songs sucks. its pretty godd i like the chorus <br />before i forget: 11/10 amazing. i love this song but the lyrics are kinda strange. 'i wear you like a stain, yet im the one whos obscene'? <br />vermilion pt.2: 8/10 this ones okay too <br />the nameless: 10/10 awesome the beggining is tight. but its wied when it gets slow all of a sudden <br />the virus of life: 9/10 pretty good but not one of my favorites <br />danger-keep away: 9/10 this songs wierd. but its good even though its slow.  <br /> <br />So sLiPkNoT does slow songs pretty good but i like all sLiPkNoT song types, wheter it be screaming to the point you cant understand what Coreys saying or acoustic songs.
B000002JK2|5.0|I remember the first time I heard this on record,and I was blown away. <br />Years later to be able to get this on cd is thrilling. <br />The album has held up well,their voices together are magic. <br /> <br />Ronnie was so gifted..a shame to lose him so young.
B00005JO1J|5.0|Wow.  Having seen Rent 5 times, in three states and 2 different countries, I honestly didn't care if the movie was a religious follower of the play; I didn't care that some of the 'original' players were not along for the ride.  The stage version is my favorite musical of all time, and I've seen plenty of them.  Every time I've gone to see the show it's because I 'just want to see it one more time..' which inevitably leads to just one more, and just one more.<br /><br />The movie is as magical as the show.  In a scant 2 hours and 15 minutes (the time flies by) the whole story is told.  Some of the details have changed, and die-hards have dissected those differences enough that I don't feel the need to recap them again here.  Suffice it to say, RENT captured a distinct time - the late 80's/early 90's and the AIDS epidemic at its most lethal - and the many different ways a group of friends dealt with the tragedy.  How amazing it is that even though AIDS is less of a death sentence today (at least in America) than it was at that time, the story is still as powerful and relevant as it was when Jonathan Larson wrote it back then.<br /><br />If you truly loved the show, you won't nitpick the finer details of things that were changed; rather, you'll be grateful that it's been committed to film for good.  If you don't like musicals, you will likely not like this film.  But if you want to see a moving movie musical, it's hard to beat RENT.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I wonder what the people that loves the REAL Titanic ( that is the ship and its story, not the movie ) thinks about this..... <br />Is there really new interesting historical material other than the usual 'extras' ? <br />Is it really worth the time or have we already seen all Cameron has to give on the ship ? <br />What do you think? <br /> <br />
B000002A3T|4.0|\\"The Division Bell\\" is the latest album (even though its 10 years old) Pink Floyd has released featuring brand new material. It is the second CD they produced without Roger Waters in the Band. The band goes back to the older styles of Pink Floyd, similar to that of \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" with a hint of dark imagery heard of from \\"The Wall\\".<br /><br />Compared to Albums released in the Prime years of Pink Floyd such as \\"Animals\\", \\"DSOTM\\", \\"WYWH\\", and \\"The Wall\\", \\"The Division Bell\\" features a less cynical tone, and more laid back.<br /><br />One of the First things you'll notice is the lack of the emphasis on the Bass. Since Roger Waters was not with Pink Floyd when they recorded this album, the Emphasis turns more to Gilmour, Mason, and Wright. As mentioned above, you might notice a change in lyrical style, less of Water's cynical but detailed lyrics, more of Gilmour reminiscent and passive lyrics.<br /><br />The Div Bell is not for everyone, if you liked Pink Floyd instrumental work more than you like their lyrics, you'll most likely like this album. If not, give this album a shot anyways, The last couple of Songs kinda resemble Water's lyrical style.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|Of all the recent remakes of Japanese horror films, I have to say that Dark Water is the only remake that actually surpasses the original. I think the reason that so many people are so hard on it is because they went in expecting to see THE RING or THE GRUDGE. They went in expecting to see a scary ghost movie. Dark Water is not really a horror movie, at least not in the traditional sense. It's actually more of a drama set in a haunted apartment complex. If you go in expecting to have stuff jump out at you, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />It's sad that everyone expects horror films to have a bunch of jump scares in them these days. Whatever happened to the slow buildup of tension and paranoia of something like ROSEMARY'S BABY. If you go into Dark Water expecting something more akin to Rosemary's Baby, you might just end up enjoying this film.<br /><br />As far as comparing this remake to the original, I will say that I felt that Jennifer Connelly was a much more compelling character than the mother in the original movie. Overall, the characters were fleshed out better. I understood the conflict between the mother, the father and the little girl much more in the remake. The original just sort of glanced over many of these details. Some of the shots were actually more effective than the ones in the original, and the ending in the remake is more satisfying and better executed than in the original. Generally, I think that J-horror is better left in its original incarnation. As much as I liked the Western version of THE RING, I felt like the only reason they remade it was to cast Naomi Watts as the lead. THE GRUDGE, they should have left that one alone. Nothing was gained by Sarah Michelle Gellar. But this one, this one is actually better than the Japanese original in my opinion.<br /><br />This movie is not for everyone. It is a slow, poignant drama set in a really creepy location. It would probably play well in a double feature with ROSEMARY'S BABY. If you want to have stuff jump out at you, watch THE GRUDGE. If you want to watch a movie that has a little more depth to it, watch DARK WATER.you want to have stuff jump out at you, watch THE GRUDGE. If you want to watch a movie that has a little more depth to it, watch DARK WATER. <br />

Things change when Willy Wonka, head of the very popular Wonka Chocolate empire, announces a contest in which five gold tickets have been hidden in chocolate bars and sent throughout the country. The kids who find the tickets will be taken on a tour of Wonka's chocolate factory and get a special glimpse of the wonders within. Charlie miraculously finds a ticket, along with four other children much naughtier than him. The tour of the factory will hold more than a few surprises for this bunch.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|For a hardcore SOAD fan such as myself, the six-month wait in between albums was pretty painful. When I first heard of their planned concept for Mesmerize/Hypnotize, I was both excited and skeptical. While I was excited about the prospect of getting double the System (most of my favorite bands take years between records), my cynical side suspected that this was a clever ploy to cash in twice on material recorded at the same time. After finally getting my hands on Hypnotize, though, I can honestly say that it was wise for them to go about it the way they did. If both albums were merged into one monster, the 70 minutes it would clock in at might be sensory overload for some. Let's face it, System's sound was tailor-made to the A.D.D. metal fan in us all, anyway.  <br /> <br />Hypnotize is the more thematic of the two and stands up a little better than Mesmerize as a substantial work. Daron's presence as a lead vocalist is more prevalent, especially on tracks like \\"Kill Rock N' Roll,\\" \\"Hypnotize,\\" and \\"Stealing Society.\\" Meanwhile, Serj shines brightest when he lets loose with his schizoid delivery on songs like \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" and \\"U-Fig.\\" The rhythm section is in top-notch form (rumor is Daron recorded most of the bass lines on both discs) throughout, as John continues to peak as a drummer (his drums rolls on \\"Attack\\" are brutal).  <br /> <br />Hypnotize, much like Mesmerize, is a lyrical jumble. The group's bipolar tendencies are in high gear here, as the topics jump from serious themes (The Armenian Genocide from 1917-1922, the frustration and outrage over the war in Iraq) to the full-blown juvenile silliness of Daron's \\"Monster Mash\\" impression on \\"She's Like Heroin\\" and the \\"BANANA, BANANA, BANANA, BANANA, TERRACOTTA, BANANA, TERRACOTTA, TERRACOTTA PIE!\\" chant-a-long chorus of \\"Vicinity of Obscenity.\\"  <br /> <br />All in all, true System fans should not be the least bit disappointed. Hypnotize has everything that has made System one of the most uniquelythrilling bands in years.  <br /> <br />To amuse myself I have created a best of compilation of material from the Mesmerize/Hypnotize sessions:  <br /> <br />1.) Attack  <br />2.) B.Y.O.B.  <br />3.) Revenga  <br />4.) Holy Mountains  <br />5.) Hypnotize  <br />6.) Radio/Video  <br />7.) This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song  <br />8.) Vicinity of Obscenity  <br />9.) U-Fig  <br />10.)Violent Pornography  <br />11.)Dreaming  <br />12.)Kill Rock N' Roll  <br />13.)Sad Statue  <br />14.)Soldier Side Intro  <br />15.)Soldier Side  <br />
B000BB1MI2|3.0|A nice expressionist realization of a story that, at bottom, is about the viciousness and wonder to which children are equally susceptible, and the culpability of parents in the failings of their children -- i.e. for the parents' failure to cultivate in their children a sense of wonder and a healthy respect for the unknown.  (That is why I think Burton's addition of the backstory regarding Wonka and his candy-hating dentist father is very much in the spirit of the original.)  The Dickensian world of Charlie is lovingly recreated by Burton, replete with a leaning shack and twisted doors that suggest the German expressionist techniques evident in the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.  The Oompah Loompahs are perfect, and Tim Burton admirably avoids the racism implicit in the original story by making the Oompah Loompahs (all but a few, as far as I can tell, played by the same suave actor) without resorting to the campiness of the prior movie version, by making them much more clever than the rest of the characters in the story.  Their musical numbers had me and my children laughing out loud, especially where in the song for Mike Teavee they become a perfect parody of 70's glam rock (nearly besting even Spinal Tap in this brief number).  Tim Burton has his hits and misses, but I liked this one.
0060922583|4.0|This book attempts to prove that the universe has similar characteristics to a hologram. But the term 'universe' here goes far beyond the physical universe.  I also includes other dimensions such as where people go when they are in between lives.<br /><br />Those other dimensions are like looking at the hologram from different angles I guess and the past and future are already contained in this hologram.<br /><br />A holograph is created by combining the images of an object with another image of that same object that has been reflected from mirrors.  If a holographic image is broken apart each fragment contains the 'memory' of the entire image and can be used to reconstruct the entire image.  I don't think anyone knows how this is possible.<br /><br />This is then related to the holographic universe consisting of a direct image from 'God' and an indirect reflection of God from us:<br /><br />\\"...our universe is constantly created and sustained by two wavelike flows, one from heaven and one coming from our own soul or spirit.\\"<br /><br />However it gets into a lot of new age topics which will mainly be interesting if you're a new ager.  I am so I found it interesting.<br /><br />There's a quite a few places where it talks about various things and then throws in the word 'hologram' once in awhile to remind the reader about the title of the book.<br /><br />This is a good book if you want to find out about other new age authors and topics for further reading.  It pulls in everything from mythology to UFOs.<br /><br />Jeff Marzano<br /><br />[[ASIN:0914732145 Fulcanelli: Master Alchemist: Le Mystere des Cathedrales, Esoteric Intrepretation of the Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work (Le Mystere Des Cathedrales ... of the Hermetic Symbols of Great Work)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181509 The Giza Power Plant : Technologies of Ancient Egypt]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1879181800 The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls: Unlocking the Secrets of the Past, Present, and Future]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876043503 The Lives of Edgar Cayce]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0876042167 Lives of the Master: The Rest of the Jesus Story]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0425093204 Edgar cayce's story of the origin and destiny of man]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0671797204 Secret Life: Firsthand, Documented Accounts of UFO Abductions]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000068V9R The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1]]the Jesus Story]]    [[ASIN:0425093204 Edgar cayce's story of the origin and destiny of man]]    [[ASIN:0671797204 Secret Life: Firsthand, Documented Accounts of UFO Abductions]]    [[ASIN:0960855815 Ufo...Contact from Planet Iarga]]    [[ASIN:B000068V9R The Outer Limits - The Original Series, Season 1]]
B00005JO1P|5.0|if you aren't yet a fan of the late great Johnny Cash here is your chance to get to know the man behind the myth,played amazingly by Joaquin Phoenix.if you also haven't listened to the also late great June Carter than this is also your chance to get to know the lady behind the myth played exquisitely by Reese Witherspoon. i was skeptical,i must admit,about seeing this film because anyone,let alone Phoenix,had some very big shoes to fill,especially taking on the role of having to sing his songs,same with Witherspoon. but i am here to tell you that both do amazing jobs and deserve the recognition they so very well deserve. i was dumbfounded actually how good phoenix really was. sorry...i'll stop my hype jabbering about him. James Mangold directs the movie beautifully with great camera movements,beautiful scenery of the south,and great performances by his cast.eventhough i gave this a perfect score there are a few things that i would have changed or done differently,which i won't get into here. but overall,this is a movie that i'll probably see again in the theatre,something i haven't done since i was a kid. the great thing is is that you don't have to be a fan of the cashs' to be able to appreciate this work of art. if you are sick of the sudden boom in music bio's don't give up on this one. the soundtrack is worth seeing in the theatre as there are some other suprises as well like acted out live performances by jerry lee lewis and elvis. you'll just have to see it for yourself. my choices for actor,actress,supporting actress,director and film are already cast.
B000AGTPUA|4.0|The Polar Express heralded a brave new world of all-digital filmmaking. Critics and audiences were divided between those who hailed it as an instant classic that captures the visual splendor and evocative innocence of Chris Van Allsburg's popular children's book, and those who felt that the innovative use of \\"performance capture\\"--to accurately translate live performances into all-digital characters--was an eerie and not-quite-lifelike distraction from the story's epic-scale North Pole adventure. In any case it's a kind-hearted celebration of the yuletide spirit, especially for kids who have almost grown out of their need to believe in Santa Claus. Tom Hanks is the nominal \\"star\\" who performs five different computer-generated characters, but it's the visuals that steal this show, as director Robert Zemeckis indulges his tireless pursuit of technological innovation.
B000B8QEYC|1.0|Almost a year after it's initial release, and because of the horror of September 11, this hack singer [yeah, right] / songwriter [oh, please] had the biggest selling piece of tripe of her career with the abhorrent 'A Day Without Rain', a dismal cacophony of synths and ooze that the world seemed to grasp onto as a sign of distorted comfort.  Well, she's back...and as misguided as ever.  More quasi-Celtic schmaltz juxtaposed with her archaic wheeze of a voice, it took 5 years to come up with this monstrosity.  She's an insult to the true musical aesthete.  My grade:  D+
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never noticed Firefly when it was on Fox, but I did glance at it when it hit the SciFi channel.  One glance didn't do it.  I thought it looked stupid and never watched even one episode. <br /> <br />Then it appeared on DVD and I read the reviews.  Hmmmm.  People loved it.  When they reduced the price I figured, what the hell, and bought it the same way Mary Tyler Moore threw the meat into the supermarket cart.  <br /> <br />Much to my surprise I totally love the show.  I watched every episode and not one, NOT ONE, was boring.  The characters are understandable, and there's a fair bit of comedy in each episode.  Best of all, unlike other SciFi stuff, there were no human-sized aliens who just happened to speak English.  Instead, we see a future where technology helps a lot, and where people are still people, warts and all. <br /> <br />This is undoubtedly my favorite collection of a sci-fi TV show.  Please, please, please -- someone pick the show up and finish the story.  There are several mysteries the series didn't get time to explain.  We gotta have more. <br /> <br />As for you, buy it.
B000BGH22W|4.0|This is beautiful music, but the change in composer (as well as the change in director) has certainly changed the mood of the narrative. Has JKR decided to let a different author do book 7 while she works on something else like \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\"? But changing the genius behind the music has the same drastic effect on the mood of the piece as that would on the text.<br /><br />No wonder everyone keeps saying the movie is darker. The more I listen to this and compare it with the scores to the first three movies I realize the main difference in the tone of the music is that there is a playful, almost childish element in the ones done by Williams -- more serious than the Hook soundtrack, but still more playful. Doyle's reminds me more of Braveheart and feels dead serious.<br /><br />The books are getting too long to come even close to capturing their spirit in the movie - perhaps breaking the movies up into terms could help? Could the dialogue cover even some of the important features of the book? The soundtrack is what carries the emotional mood of the books into the movie and as the books get longer and the dialogue cut more the music has more ground to cover. I can't recall Draco hardly saying anything - though I liked him as a ferret, hardly any of Hermione's genius is present - we miss the amazing arrival of Mr. Weasley arriving for Harry. That would have been precious. Ludo didn't make the cut - we did not see Krum actually do anything at the World Cup! I think I even heard him call Hermione's name properly. Rita gets barely enough chance for us to notice her and JKR's critique on the press. Did anyone see any bugs? Worst of all, the whole emotional feel of the previous three movies is lost with the change in composers. Williams has a special voice and it communicates the emotion meant to be experienced in each scene. This movie has a different voice. The music is still beautiful and does the job but there is a bit of magic absent, about the same as when Richard Harris passed away and the special quality of his character went with him. But Williams is still with us thankfully! So what were they thinking?<br /><br />Patrick Doyle's credits are interesting -- I found it interesting that \\"Gilderoy Lockheart\\" is one of the directors Doyle has worked with frequently.<br /><br />In several conversations, including one with a music teacher, I have heard the opinion that this is the best movie by far and the music better -- or that the music had to be darker, and the movie darker, because the book is darker. I agree that this is likely, but still feel that the earlier books, movies, and music, were more like kids books, movies, and music. Book 4 feels more adult -- well, the kids are fourth years and maturing. I think of how as the books came out with a year or so in between there was an enforced wait for the audience to read them so the audience aged along with the books. Now that they are all available except for book 7, and the movies I expect will gradually come available as well, we are left with the dilemma of when or how to use the materials to educate or raise children. Should you start as early? Should you make the younger children wait a year before reading the next book? Can you expect to do that with the movies as well?d away and the special quality of his character went with him. But Williams is still with us thankfully! So what were they thinking?

B00005JO17|5.0|Omigod! I just saw this movie last weekend, and it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe that people hate this movie. They've just got no taste at all in Disney movies anymore. Just wait till Narnia comes out. THAT oughta change their minds. I loved everything about this film: the plot, characters, songs, EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <br /> <br />You all know the story of Chicken Little and how he thought the sky was falling, right? WRONG! This is the REAL story of what happened after this incident. Sadly, Chicken Little (Zach Braff) is now the laughingstock of the entire town, and has only his friends Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack, Toy Story 2, Runaway Bride, In & Out), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) & Fish Out of Water (an office water tank, and NO! I'm not lying!) to comfort him. Desperately wanting to make his dad, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall, director of Happy Days, The Princess Diaries, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, Never Been Kissed), he decides to try out for the baseball team. He wouldn't become a star (since Miss Snooty Spoiled Brat Foxy Loxy {Amy Sedaris} keeps taking all the credit) until after hitting & scoring the winning point of the championship game. Finally, things are starting to go right for him... That is, until a piece of the sky falls... AGAIN! Oh, no! What will Chicken Little do? Will anybody believe him this time? Or will he be a reject all over again?  <br /> <br />This film is both funny and has important messages to struggling families (those with single parents, children or relatives suffering from disabilities, etc.): 1. If you have a serious problem going on within or around you, talk about it, for God's sake! 2. Never stop believing in yourself or your friends/family. 3. When in doubt, just follow your heart. <br /> <br />It also has some fun music to sing to, including Braff's version of \\"We Are the Champions\\", Zahn's version of \\"I Will Survive\\" and the entire cast's version of \\"Don't Go BreakingMy Heart\\". You'll also really like the Cheetah Girls version of \\"Shake Your Tail Feathers\\". <br /> <br />Go ahead! Watch this film! What are you? Too... CHICKEN to go see it? I hope not! Go to your local theater today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JO1G|1.0|Desert Storm is considered by many to be the most one-sided victory in all of history, where the combined forces of the US, UK, France and many other nations obliterated the battle-hardened forces of the enormous (500,000 man) Iraqi military after it conquered the tiny nation of Kuwait.<br /><br />Rather than showing you the greatness of the US Marines or the masterful battle tactics used to defeat the Iraqis with minimal loss of life on the allies' side, Jarhead focuses on the negative. It dwells upon the rigors of Marine basic training, the sadistic drill sergeants, the lack of freedom men have as soldiers and many other negative aspects of soldier life. It also seems to paint every wife and girlfriend of a Marine as a cheating tramp.<br /><br />There were not many people in the theatre when I went to see this movie. Now I know why. Not only is this movie insulting to our soldiers, it is down right boring. I strain to remember a \\"war\\" movie which shows less action than Jarhead. It is very simular to the movie \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" in that both movies emphasize upon US Marine training, and only devote a few minutes at the very end to actual combat. Jarhead, however, has no combat depicted whatsoever. The characters witness one bombing.<br /><br />There is little in the way of characterization. Marines are divided into mindless grunts who want out and brainwashed yahoos who actually enjoy serving.<br /><br />Much of the film is devoted to Marines acting like perverts who can't stop playing with themselves. Garbage.
B000006TRV|5.0|How can you not like this CD!<br /><br />I have this CD and It's PF's 2nd CD. This is a rock opera about a young man named Pink, and he goes thru life's toughest situations.

The movie's also good, and the subliminal message in \\"Empty Spaces\\" is very bone-chilling.<br /><br />Any Floyd Fan must have this!!!
B00005JO1J|3.0|If you have never seen Rent in any form, I urge you to see the play first.  The movie captures the spirit of Jonathan Larson but must dumb it down a lot to comply with FCC standards that gave them their PG13 rating.  Songs are lost (\\"Halloween,\\" \\"Contact,\\" \\"We're Okay,\\" the end half of \\"Good-bye Love\\" (which, I might add, explains Mimi going to rehab) and most disappointingly \\"Christmas Bells\\") and others are turned into spoken word dialogue (\\"You Okay Honey,\\" \\"New Years Eve\\").  In other songs, some of the characters are removed (such as Joanne in \\"Rent\\" and Angel in \\"You'll See Boys\\") in order not to confuse the audience.   <br /> <br />The opening sequence of the film-from the cast standing on the stage at the Nederlander through the most expensive four minutes in a non-action film (the singing of \\"Rent\\")-sets the tone perfectly.  The quick cutting and loud rock edge introduces these characters the way the play does-with no holds barred as they toss flaming pieces of paper out the window.  The camera work is flawless here, as it is throughout the film, with high crane angles, sweeping jib motions, and the smooth pans of a steadicam.  It is perfect. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't quite match that initial tone: suddenly \\"New York\\" became very colorful and bright-a bit too well-lit and jovial for a serious story about relationships and hard times falling on a group of friends.  While film was shot in 2:35 ratio to give the effect that you are still watching a stage performance (and thus you can see a great deal of the scenery around the characters), none of the subsequent scenes are as dark in texture or as high-energy (in terms of production value) as the opener.  They put everything into it and came out spent, taking a breather in \\"You'll See Boys\\" which pretty much holds two camera positions throughout the dialogue and song.  The pacing never found its flow: it jumped around and felt extremely rushed at the end as montage after montage wasused to explain events that passed in the 525,600 minutes of these friends' lives.  For example, Mimi was only seen as a true addict throughout at the last few moments; up until then she just appeared like the majority of young New Yorkers in the art scene-a dabbler, an experimenter.   <br /> <br />What was the most upsetting to me, though, was how the play was an ensemble cast, with Mark as a narrator throughout.  The film tried to duplicate that but fell short: by cutting solo songs for Joanne and Angel, they became secondary characters.  The balance was never retrieved.   I'm not quite sure what Christopher Columbus actually did with this film: the cast didn't need much coaching, as the majority of them originated in these roles, and those the characters were already theirs.  Each and every one of them gave an impeccable performance.  Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography (as always) was complex and beautiful and added to the vibrant world, especially in \\"Life Support,\\" when the camera took a 360 around the circle, always over the shoulder of one member to another and never once losing focus.  Only once did it distract from the moment: when Mimi has just come back from nearly ODing she and Roger are sharing a moment, and they are in the far left corner of the screen, leaving an evenly spaced Maureen and Joanne to fill the middle and right side of the screen, and leaving the eye to naturally be drawn to them, even though it is a clear moment for Mimi.  However, the fact that I can't find Chris Columbus in this film is not, by any means, a negative comment: he is no auteur, and if he tried to make too great a mark, he would have ruined the film.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, though: just because I am being critical does not mean I did not enjoy my time in the theatre.  I saw the film at 12:01 AM on November 23rd-the very first showing on the west coast, and I was surrounded by other true Rent fans.  We cheered, we clapped, we sang along, and we mooed with Maureen(as we should have).  I am perhaps overly critical of this film not just because I work in this industry but also because I had such high expectations for the film-being such a diehard fan (I saw the play on Broadway six times before I moved out of New York and once in LA since).  Jesse L Martin was especially endearing: he took Tom Collins to a new level and clearly had a lot of fun doing it.  The high moments of the film (other than the performances) were the almost \\"Chicago's\\" Roxanne moment in \\"Tango Maureen,\\" \\"La Vie Boheme,\\" (even though they took out parts of it) \\"Take Me Or Leave Me,\\" and \\"Without Me.\\" <br /> <br />Rent will make you laugh, make you cry, and most importantly, make you feel for and relate to its main characters.  To some the subject matter is still controversial, but at the core is the most endearing and heartwarming story about true friends that I have ever seen.  Rent is a great film, but an incomparable play.  They should set up a three-camera shoot at the Nederlander and put that on DVD.
B00005JO1J|5.0|As a diehard Rent fan, I must admit I was very skeptical of the big-screen adaptation.  Since my first viewing of Rent, I have adapted the lyrics as my personal mantras, listened to the soundtrack weekly, and fully submerged myself into the sheer beauty of Rent. <br /> <br />I am very thrilled to confirm, however, that the movie was nothing less then spectacular, and, dare I say, better than the play?    The liberties that Chris Columbus took were minimal enough to not affect the mood of the play, and also add to the clarity of the story for those who haven't deeply studied and analyzed every single action, song, line, etc. in the play.   <br /> <br />Any viewer will be enthralled for the two-ish hours (and the time does fly by), and I myself was deeply sad it was over.  I was ready to buy another ticket as I walked out of the theatre and go see it again, and I certainly plan on going back to see it again.  This play was great for my friends who had seen it once, seen it multiple times, and for those who have never seen it before.   <br /> <br />It was wonderful from the beginning of Seasons of Love to the end of Finale.  It was amazing.  That's all I can say.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|This is exactly what it should have been. Its called a greatest hits not a best of so it only features Neil Youngs biggest selling singles. This isnt like other Greatest Hits that feature every single, no this one only has the big hits, really the songs that every one and their brother knows. This covers everything from Neils first hit single in 1969 all the way to his last in 1992. Some people complain about how their is nothing from Buffaloe Springfield well none of their songs were an actual hit single. While yes they were a great band and made some amazing songs, none of them sold. And then some complain about nothing after 1992, well Harvest Moon was the mans last hit single so even though he made albums after that those non-hits dont have a place on a GREATEST HITS compalation!<br /><br />From start to end. From the amazingly killer 'Down By The River' to the close of 'Harvest Moon' this cd rocks harder then most do today even though all the songs are at least 12 years old.<br /><br />As I always say in my reviews for greatest hits, (well almost always because some bands make bad albums some all you want is a greatest hits) but as I usually say, this is something I would recomend to some one just getting into Neil Young. It shows all the sides of him Grunge/country rock/country/folk/hard rock/classic rock, its all here and for a new fan I think this even more then Decade is a great way to lead someone down the path of being a Neil Young and Crazy Horse fan.<br /><br />This covers most of his carear and it certainly highlights most if not all of the highlights, so for those of you who dont give this five stars remember this, this cd did exactly what it promised to do so for that you have to give it five stars, highly recomended!
B0002XDODU|5.0|Until I get my copy of Rosenrot, anyway. <br /> <br />This CD combines powerful and melodic Teutonic vocals, unmatched metal guitar and bass sound, and operatic touches in a way that builds on Rammstein's previous releases, especially Mutter, but subtly changes the direction of the music. <br /> <br />RR is more melodic than any previous release, and uses the full range of Till's amazing voice throughout. The Dresden Symphonic Orchestra and Cathedral Choir add an element that is unique to Rammstein's Wagnerian sound. <br /> <br />Every song on this cd is worth listening to. Repeatedly. They are all outstanding, but \\"Ohne Dich\\", \\"Amerika\\", \\"RR\\", \\"Morgenstern\\" and \\"Amour\\" will blow your mind. <br /> <br />I unconditionally recommend this CD to anyone who likes metal of any kind. And to those of you who dislike Rammstein because they're to \\"corporate\\" or \\"mainstream\\", give this a listen and then see what you think. You'll be a devout Rammstein fan after the first time through. It's like nothing else on Earth. <br />
B00005JOHI|4.0|****<br /><br />Aah, Jane Austen. The \\"Harry Potter\\" of the independent theater chains. Always reliable to pack the theaters. And you can count on a new film based on one of her books every few years.<br /><br />Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) is in a state, her family of five daughters is living on borrowed time. She and her husband Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) live on their current estate as the guests of family members, and it has seen better days. With five growing daughters, she feels it imperative to begin marrying them off, hopefully to rich suitors who can then help provide for Mr. and Mrs. Bennet and the unwed daughters. When word arrives that a nearby estate has been rented by Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), a rich man from London, she becomes anxious that he meet her eldest daughter, Jane (Rosamunde Pike), scheming for them to spend every available moment together. At the local ball, Jane meets Mr. Bingley and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), the second oldest of the Bennet children, meets Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen), Mr. Bingley's friend and guest. Just as Jane and Bingley seem to be headed to the altar, Mr. Bingley leaves the estate causing Jane to become distraught. Elizabeth learns that Darcy may have been responsible and her hatred grows. Yet, every time they meet, Elizabeth finds herself more and more attracted to Darcy. But is the feeling mutual?<br /><br />Just when it seems another film based on a Jane Austen book, especially one already made into a film or miniseries at least six times, not counting the numerous other takes on the same material (\\"Bride and Prejudice\\", a recent example), could be excessive, this version of \\"Pride\\" pushes the envelope, offering something new.<br /><br />One of the best things this film does is cast more authentic looking people in the lead roles. From Knightley on down, all of the actors have a rougher appearance, which seems entirely appropriate for the time. Some previous film adaptations of Austen's work have cast the most beautiful American (Aaaah- Gwyneth Paltrow - choo!) or British actors in the roles. Every time they appeared on screen, it looked like they just walked out of their make-up trailer. Sure, they looked beautiful, but it isn't believable. \\"Pride\\" strives for and attains a more accurate depiction.<br /><br />Keira Knightley is very pretty, but she isn't glamorous. Too skinny, which may be the one aspect of her that doesn't fit the period, she otherwise seems like a pretty girl. Her features are not perfect and this helps her seem to be a natural fit for the English countryside. Also, there are many scenes in which she has just come in from a walk, or the girls are laying about reading books, etc., and they don't appear perfectly groomed; hair may be out of place or there may be mud on the hem of their skirt. It works. In one scene, Dame Judi Dench arrives at the Bennet home. Irate, her hair is not perfect, because she has just arrived on horseback. Matthew McFadyen is also very handsome, but he isn't movie star handsome. He isn't as good looking as Colin Firth or Hugh Grant and it seems more appropriate for the role, the setting and the time.<br /><br />Director Joe Wright also does some interesting things with the camera, which may seem strange or obtrusive on paper, but actually make the experience of watching the film more interesting and enjoyable. In one scene, the camera follows Mrs. Bennet through a ball hosted by Mr. Bingley. She passes certain people throughout the filled rooms. When the camera spots one of the Bennet girls, it stops briefly, allowing us to hear their conversation. After we have heard what we need, it picks up and follows another character, past another conversation. Soon, the camera spots Mrs. Bennet again as she finally reaches the outdoor patio for some fresh air. In another, the camera roves across the windows in the Bennet home picking up pieces of conversation in each of the bedrooms, starting with Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. This gives usthe feeling we are watching a book come to life, as though we are turning the pages as we read. It is an effective technique, aiding the look and feel of the film.<br /><br />All of the performances in the film are very good. Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are very believable as the unrequited lovers. Knightley conveys Elizabeth's intelligence, pride and passion, at turns, throughout the film. She is low key, but very interesting. When she initially meets Darcy, she claims her hatred for him and his attitude. Later, as she tells her father she really loves him, he doesn't understand, yet we do. Matthew MacFadyen conveys Darcy's boredom, growing attraction and passion as well. There are more than a few instances when their attraction to one another is palpable, yet because of their misunderstandings, or misconceptions about one another, are unable to act. It seems as though they take shifts; in one scene Elizabeth is in love with him. In others, he loves her. Throughout, reciprocation is prevented by an outside influence of some sort. The final scene is also very romantic.<br /><br />All of the supporting characters are equally believable. Brenda Blethyn is a little over the top, but it works to see her running around, insinuating her daughters into the lives of every eligible bachelor within ten miles. Donald Sutherland is great as the father who is much quieter than his wife, yet he exudes a quiet admiration for his partner. He is also the more level headed member of the family providing calm and serenity to his somewhat overbearing wife. Judi Dench is also memorable as a member of the aristocracy who tries to control the lives of some of the people involved.<br /><br />I don't think we can ask for more in a film adaptation of a book; the characters, their persona, the setting and the feel of the period are all correct creating an engrossing film worthy of any book.s us the feeling we are watching a book come to life, as though we are turning the pages as we read.

B00005JLRT|4.0|This is the latest movie from the Star Trek TNG series. The interesting thing about it is that the director was not a \\"trekkie\\".<br /><br />He was not familiar with the previous episodes of Star Trek TNG,<br /><br />so he brought his own approach to the movie.<br /><br />Of course, this film has all the features that make up a normal Star Trek movie: space travel, lots of action, shootings...<br /><br />It has a funny scene in the begining, where Will Riker is is getting married to Deanna Troi. Lieutenant commander Data gets the chance to sing a jazz song by Irving Berlin:<br /><br />\\"Never saw the sun shining so bright,<br /><br /> Never saw things going so right.<br /><br /> Noticing the days hurrying by...<br /><br /> When you are in love, my how they fly...\\"<br /><br />I really like that song, because it is so optimistic.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some elements of a horror movie.<br /><br />There is some virus that springs out from a sphere, goes up to the ceiling<br /><br />and then falls down and poisons a room full of people. Their faces become<br /><br />ugly as hell. Later, some ugly faces with almost vampire-like teeth appear<br /><br />again. And Deanna Troi has nightmares, in which her husband Will Riker<br /><br />is getting replaced with one of those faces.<br /><br />The saddest thing is that at the end of this movie,<br /><br />Data dies in a starship explosion. He dies without even saying anything,<br /><br />or without making an effort to save himself. What is left afterwards<br /><br />is his brother B4 (\\"before\\"). But unfortunately B4 is a prototype - an earlier model - and he is not as smart as Data.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I recommend this movie. I can keep talking a lot about the other interesting characters - Praetor Shinzon, etc. But it is better if you see the movie for yourself. Just remember to close your eyes when the ugly faces show up. Otherwise, the movie's colors and special effects are spectacular. If you watch it on DVD (not on VHS) and on a brand-new latop (like I did), the experience is out of this world. It feels as if you are in space together with the crew of the Enterprise.experience is out of this world.

B000069HKH|5.0|1.) My City of Ruins: This is just an all-around fantastic song, Bruce at his best. <br /> <br />2.) Empty Sky: Another fabulous tune, meaningful lyrics... Great. <br /> <br />3.)Countin' on A Miracle: Admittedly a bit repetitive, both the tune and the words to this song are great.  <br /> <br />4.)Further On (Up the Road): The most underrated song on this album. Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. <br /> <br />5.)Lonesome Day: Yet another great song on a great album. <br /> <br />6.)The Rising: The title track, and well-deservedly: one of the Boss' best. <br /> <br />7.)Mary's Place: Although the lyrics don't match up with the rest of the album, the tune makes up for it: a rollicking good time. <br /> <br />8.) Worlds Apart: Lucky Town and Born in the USA rolled into one: great tune AND lyrics. <br /> <br />9.) Let's be Friends (Skin to Skin): I must admit, this one took a while for me to like it, but I've grown to love it, odd backup and all. <br /> <br />10.)Into the Fire: Yeah, I know, how could I put it this low! You must have no respect for what this song is about! No, that's not it... But Bruce Springsteen is not equal to Dr. Phil. I like the lyrics too, thank you very much, but... Look at the songs above. They're REALLY hard to beat. <br /> <br />11.) Paradise: I'm sorry. I really am. I don't like this song. <br /> <br />12.) Waitin' On A Sunny Day: A fine song, but nothing special, especially by the standards of this album. <br /> <br />13.) Nothing Man: As good as this song is... It doesn't do it for me. The tune is that of a filler song... Shades of Bob Orden. <br /> <br />14.) You're Missing: For the life of me, I can't figure out what's the big deal about this song.  <br /> <br />15.) The Fuse: simply does not deserve to be on this album.
B0002S947K|5.0|I first heard one of his songs on Last fm a few months back. I don't remember the song, but I immediately loved it. I made sure I caught the name of the artist because it was one of those songs that were so wonderful, you just knew this person was really switched on and the rest of the album had to be at least decent. Well, this album is about 5 shades beyond decent. It restores your faith in new music. It's perfect. It's like vocally he's channeled Bob Segar, the good parts of Damien Rice, Joe Cocker and a touch of the knowing soul that Otis Redding had. His voice is better than sex. I have no idea what he looks like and I don't know what I'm gonna do with my current husband, but I'm gonna run off and be a groupie for him, lol. <br />Seriously, check it out.
B000002U8G|4.0|Pink Floyd started their musical career in the late 60s. Their first albums contained experimental psychodelia that pleases fans to this day. While their early work is excellent, most fans recognize Pink Floyd for their profound, melodic, beautiful sound They shaped in the 70s.     PF started to find their true way with \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", released in 1970. The album gets mixed reviewes, but it became popular in the time it was released. The follow-up, Meddle, is even greater work, showing the mellow side of the band. It remains overshadowed by their later albums (Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here) which are considerably PF finest hour, but Meddle is a gem that should not be overlooked.    One Of These Days is excellent powerful opener to the album. Haunting bass riff and Gilmour's guitar work always gimme the thrills; it easily became a concert staple. A Pillow Of Winds is beautiful acoustic ballad; Fearless follows similar style, with some crowd yelling to it that is kinda annoying; San Tropez is funny acoustic-jazz piece. Really catchy; Seamus is Pink Floyd doing acoustic blues, plus extra vocal accompaniment by... the dog. For the end We've got something special; Echoes is 23+ minutes long, but don't let the length of this song scare You; it is simply a masterpiece. Atmosphere of this song is incredible. It starts with simple melancholic sounds, but then it developes in a dark story about the submerged life. It has a break-up psychodelic part in the middle that works perfectly as a ornament to the song mood. Tu sume up, it's one of the best PF efforts.     This album is very interesting point in Pink Floyd career. If You're new to the band this is a good point to start, but I would recommend Dark Side Of The Moon for the very beginning. But don't forget to check out Meddle, also.
068987474X|5.0|I just spent the last 6 months obsessing over a \\"great\\" guy who appeared to have every inclination of taking the next step and truly making me a part of his future. After reading \\"He's just not that into you,\\" All of the obvious signs were like a slap in the face! Greg and Liz spell out exactly why a man who is really smitten treats his intended like a precious part of his life, and why a man who is not sure about a girl does not. From the obvious (\\"He's just not that into you if he's not calling you\\") to the uncomfortable (He's just not that into you if he's sleeping with someone else\\"), this book should get any sane girl out of any muddy grey relationship and empower her to move on with her life.     A must have for every woman over 16!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I have been a system of a down fan since i was 13 years old...back when the backstreet boys were concedered \\"COOL\\".( and this is coming from a \\"prepy\\" girl, as some like to say)  ANYWAY! from following SOAD from their very first album, i must say that they have seriously changed over the years in an AWESOME WAY!!!  <br /> <br />This album had me Laughing out loud, smiling, and Crying the whole way through! No words can ever explain how amazing this album is! Yet, for those of you that hate the idea of Daron as a singer,you will be greatly dissapointed. in almost every song Daron has a part. personaly i think he is amazing, Of course Serj is 100x's better! but i think Daron's original sound adds to the fun, crazyness of their songs!  <br /> <br />The mixture of intrumental sounds is absolutely breathtaking! i found myself shreeking with excitement and yelling \\" OMG GUYS, THIS SONG IS SO SICK!!\\" to my friends durring EVERY song! <br /> <br />I could go on and on forever about this insanely perfect album! I RECOMEND IT TO ALL SOAD FANS! ( except stubborn ones who, cant deal with change, and Daron's voice ) <br /> <br />Also, if you are a N00B to SOAD's music, and have only listened to Mezmerize and Hypnotize...SERIOUSLY!! Go back and download/buy their old albums! they are worth every penny! and they will make you appreciate Hypnotize even more! <br /> <br />oh yeah, and mark my words, Holy Mountains is going to be a single! its amazing. <br />
6301966562|5.0|I originally saw Electric Dreams for the first time on a Sony Betamax system with enhanced HI-FI stereo sound. The movie just stuck with me even til now. There are just so many wonderful moments in this film that one cannot help but to become enamored of it. The humor, romance, and intrigue in the story all mesh together beautifully into a well thought out and executed cinematographic experience for all. The sound quality is extraordinary and the choice of musical tracks just plain wonderful. So with a movie with so much going for it, what more can one ask for?  <br /> <br />Simple...BRING THIS FILM TO DVD! <br /> <br />Manny Fernandez
0553802534|2.0|I just can't believe LS wrote these lines. I can't even call it a book. The main plot -there is a main plot?- Could be written in maybe twenty pages at most. The rest of the book is just a waste of paper and ink. In the epilogue you'll see that they thought who was the bad guy, but they never say why or how they thought  who was he/her.<br /><br />Blunders:<br /><br />Who cares what happened with the psychologist? Were pages and pages talking Elizabeth with Bobby and if you skip all those chapters you'll miss nothing.<br /><br />How could the cops just accuse another cop - whom was always a very good cop - of confabulating a slaughter just because one of the cops has a hunch?<br /><br />How can the same cops accuse him of killing one of his friends - whom he also was a cop -?<br /><br />And the biggest:<br /><br />How is possible that a high Judge of the US Court became a judge and nobody knew he forged his marriage?<br /><br />If this were the first book I ever read from LG this would be also the last one. She made much better books than this one.
B000A6CLL0|4.0|Of the four Star Trek seasons, this is far and away the darkest of the four, featuring a 9/11 theme.  Earth suffers a devastating attack from an alien species, and Enterprise is dispatched to eliminate the threat.  In this season we see a darker, more ruthless Captain Archer, who is determined to carry out his mission, occasionally bending, or even breaking, his usual high ethical standards.<br /><br />This season is pretty good, and most of the episodes are excellent entertainment.  The cast continues to develop excepting Hoshi and Mayweather, who for some reason seem to recede in this season.  The MACOs are a valuable addition to the cast, and frankly it now seems odd that a Starship would travel on missions without a group that is skilled at tactical operations on the ground.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is my theory that this season is perhaps the cause of the Enterprise series' demise.  Most Star Trek episodes stand on their own, and the viewer needs only a minimal familiarity with the series, or even none at all, in order to enjoy a given episode.  Not so Season Three.  This is essentially a miniseries about Enterprise's struggle against the Xindi (the alien race that attacked Earth, and which Enterprise seeks to de-fang).  The various episodes are highly interconnected and require quite a bit of familiarity with the series in order to make sense.  Despite being pretty darned good entertainment, I believe that this inhibited the ability of the series to attract new viewers, or even retain some viewers who for whatever reason could only catch some but not all episodes.  Usually a series like Enterprise hits its stride around Season Three, and perhaps really begins to attract viewers.  That is not what happened here, and I speculate (with minimal data, admittedly) that the complexity of the Season Three theme hurt the ability of the series to attract viewers.<br /><br />The other thing I dislike about Season Three is the heavy time-travel theme.  I believe that the best Star Trek episodes are those that stick with its core theme: what will mankind find when it ventures out among the stars, and what will these discoveries do to and for mankind?  Interstellar travel makes unlmited theme variations possible.  There is no need for time travel, which is improbable of achievement, in contrast with space travel, which is probably humanity's ultimate destiny.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Enterprise did not stay around longer, because in my opinion Enterprise is far and away the best of the Star Trek series (and I love them all!).  Enterprise really captures the notion of humankind just beginning to explore the nearby regions of the Galaxy, encountering new intelligent species for the first time, including species such as the Andorians and the Vulcans who are more technologically advanced than humans.  Enterprise has a fresh, \\"New Frontier\\" feeling to it that the best episodes of The Original Series also had. (See \\"The Menagerie\\" episode if you want an example of this).<br /><br />Nothing in this review is meant to minimize the entertainment value of Season Three.  This is wonderful entertainment from which anyone who likes science fiction and/or Star Trek will derive great enjoyment.  I give it four stars rather than five simply to contrast it with the superb Season Four.  Season Four is the season in which the series really hit its stride, showing the tremendous possibilities Enterprise made possible.that the best Star Trek episodes are those that stick with its core theme: what will mankind find when it ventures out among the stars, and what will these discoveries do to and for mankind?

B000AP04OM|3.0|I'm talking about this 40th anniversary edition. First of, I love the film very much, and I have seen it both in the theatre and on video a million times. This DVD edition has wonderful special features on disc two which I enjoy watching immensely. But, I'm quite disappointed with the new video transfer on disc 1 of this edition. While it looks much better that the previous DVD edition released four years ago, it's not perfect. The color timing is quite wrong and they make everything looks so pastel and too blue. It looks like the whole film was shot at the exactly same time everyday, no sense of time or whatsoever. The original prints has a very atmospheric, warm and rich color balance. Where is that on this DVD. It's gone! The only good thing about it is a proper widescreen aspect ratio that allows you to enjoy the whole 70MM frame that the film originated, without panning and scanning that they did years back on VHS releases.  <br />
0553801503|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews on Amazon, I was afraid that Martin may have lost his touch, and that A Feast for Crows would not be of the same quality as the previous three. <br /> <br />I'm happy to say that is not the case.  Whilst I, like many am dismayed that Jon, Tyrion etc are not in this book, Martin has introduced other memorable characters. <br /> <br />Euron Croweye, the Darkstar of Dorne, Arianne to name a few. <br /> <br />So, ignore these reviews and read the book for yourself.  The quality has not diminished in the slightest, and Martin is still the best when it comes to weaving a mesmerizing tale!
B0009UC7H0|2.0|In \\"Sahara,\\" Matthew McConaughey plays an archaeologist/adventurist with a bit of a quixotic streak (he even has his own Sancho Panza-type comic relief sidekick to accompany him on his adventures) and a full-on action-hero name (Dirk Pitt).  Dirk's impossible dream - get this - involves finding and salvaging an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that he believes somehow made its way across the entire Atlantic Ocean before it sank in a river in Africa!  In his search for the unlikely relic, Dirk soon finds himself knee deep in trouble, trying to make his way through a country ruled by a vicious, bloodthirsty warlord and torn asunder by chaos.  Penelope Cruz plays a World Health Organization official determined to enter the country to help stave off a plague that seems to be taking hold there.  The two of them, both with markedly different motives, wind up joining forces as they take on the murderous thugs and corrupt officials who are determined to stop them from reaching their goals.<br /><br />\\"Sahara\\" is one of those movies in which a bunch of beautiful people wisecrack their way through one death-defying adventure after another - with an occasional time out for platonic romance and a moment or two of social conscience.  The problem here, though, is that the humor is pretty wan overall and the action sequences strictly standard-issue in nature.  The acting, too, is pretty shallow, with McConaughey spending most of his time flexing his muscles, and Cruz making the most glamorous and least convincing ambassador of goodwill to a third world country since Angelina Jolie tried the same stunt a few years back.  And, of course, as is the case with so many of these films, \\"Sahara\\" reduces complex geopolitical realities to little more than simpleminded melodramatic cliches.<br /><br />As the movie drags on, the plot becomes more and more ridiculous at every turn and the stunts more and more over-the-top, with the whole shebang culminating in one of those hail-to-Dorothy-the-Wicked-Witch-is-dead - type endings that is as corny as it is preposterous.  Chances are, though, that you'll have dusted off the sands of \\"Sahara\\" long before that point.il-to-Dorothy-the-Wicked-Witch-is-dead - type endings that is as corny as it is preposterous.

B000AYQJ3I|4.0|Although there is nothing wrong with the original 3-LP/2-CD soundtrack of the Concert for Bangla Desh, one's enjoyment of this event increases immeasurably by seeing it on DVD.  In its present incarnation, the surround stereo mix far surpasses the already-wonderful sound of the original LPs, so one can hear--and now see--the concert as never before. <br /> <br />Even if Bangla Desh weren't an unpredecented massive charity concert--it, and not Woodstock, is the true forerunner of Live Aid, Live 8, and other big charity benefits--it would still be an impressive show.  The concert begins with 20 minutes of Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan swapping lines back and forth on sitar and sarod--by the time they get to the Gat (fast) section, performed in Teental (16-beat rhythm), they are as astonishing--perhaps even more so--as Harrison and Clapton trading riffs back and forth on the \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" solo.  The Indian music section--a series of improvisations over a Bengali folk melody--is an itegral part of the show, not only because it sets the context of the purpose of the concert, but because it reminds the audience that virtuoso musicianship, passion, intensity, and sheer excitement don't just have to be found in electric instruments and blues-based riffs.  Harrison tells the audience that the Indian music is \\"a little more serious\\" than the rock music to follow, but looking at the sheer delight on Shankar's face at the end of the set, you know not to equate serious with boring.  It's a transcendant moment, not even a half hour into the show. <br /> <br />The supergroup Harrison assembled for the second part of the show is no less spectacular. Especially noticeable in the film are the choir (often lost in the LP mix), the powerhouse drum combination of Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner, and Billy Preston's infectious enthusiasm both during his own number and during the rest of the songs in general.  Harrison delivers his numbers with a seriousness and intensity that helps to reinterpret the spiritual lyrics of \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Awaiting on You All\\" in a new light--even \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Something\\" take on new meaning in light of the occasion.   <br /> <br />Bob Dylan's unbilled guest appearance, of course, is nothing short of stunning--Dylan doesn't just whiz through his numbers and run off, he takes the occasion seriously, and revisits his old hits with the confidence and maturity of a man who's had a long rest.  No head games with audience, no shouts of \\"Judas\\": Dylan's performance is the record of a man who has made peace with his audience and with his own past. <br /> <br />If the concert had a consistent spiritual theme running through it, then that theme was interrupted somewhat by the solo set from Leon Russell--a medley of \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" and the old Coasters number, \\"Youngblood.\\"  They're great performances to be sure, but a little out of keeping with the spirit of the event.  The DVD includes a sound-check run through of Robert Johnson's \\"Come In My Kitchen\\"--maybe a Johnson number would have been a better choice here? <br /> <br />No matter--Harrison returns to form with the encore, \\"Bangla Desh,\\" a reading that conveys much more passion on the DVD than either its audio form, or in the fairly tepid studio single that was released at the same time. <br /> <br />Any criticisms?  Only two--the DVD doesn't include Dylan's performance of \\"Mr Tambourine Man,\\" which the LP/CD does.  No one has explained this--perhaps the film was unusable or never existed.  It's a small matter, but it would be nice to have.  On the other hand, Disc 2 does include lots of good extras, including a couple of extra Dylan tracks, so I'm not unhappy.  The new artwork, too, takes the focus away from the event, as represented by the famous baby in front of the empty bowl photo, and on Harrison--there's even a featurette that explains why a picture of the band wasn't used in the original artwork--it seems a shamenot to follow that lead in the 2005 version. <br /> <br />The deluxe version does include the original cover (with the original orange cover) and some extra goodies, but is probably not worth the extra expense.  Buy the regular version--hunt down a copy of the vinyl set if you can, if only for the magnificent 65-page colour booklet that came with it, and enjoy the unique piece of history, lovingly and respectfully treated in the DVD release.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|While `A Day Without Rain' was Enya's summertime album, so to say, and provided a refreshing change from her usual sombre fare, it was a relatively safe affair that really offered nothing new and verged on being mediocre and harmless. `Amarantine' doesn't completely recover from the signs of creative strain already showing in her previous outing, but familiar tones from albums past, particularly `Watermark' and `The Memory of Trees', will provide something satisfying for existing fans, even if this work isn't the best way to be introduced to a songstress who has proven herself many times, and better at that, before. <br /> <br />It stings a little to say that `Amarantine' contains material that doesn't bring itself above the meagre quality of filler, but sadly it does. Dreary ballads with almost monotonous melodies and lacklustre arrangements like `It's in the Rain', `I Could Be Where You Are' and `A Moment Lost' contribute nothing to the album other than demonstrating the very worst that Enya's compositions can be should the creative sensibilities that she's exhibited frequently in the past leave her. `It's in the Rain' in particular is an example of how her signature sound of synthesised instruments and vocals could become dated dangerously soon. The title track is a by-the-numbers Enya song that is a highlight inasmuch as it is the title track. It is bland while pleasant and would be unsurprisingly found, as a forgettable number, on `A Day Without Rain'. <br /> <br />Other songs are perhaps best described as shifty. `Someone Said Goodbye' is hummable but plays like a bluesy pop song running on strings instead of drums. The use of a novel language does nothing to help `Sumiregusa', and `Amid the Falling Snow' sounds like it belongs on a compilation of alternative Christmas carols. The lyrics on the entire album are mostly trite and repetitive, I'm sorry to say, and whatever attempts they make at creating a resonant emotional core fail quite embarrassingly. Even excerpts in Loxian from Roma Ryan's book read like nothing more than faux-philosophical musings that seem to settle for thinking that they cannot go wrong by making convenient references to mystical images and ultimately simplistic metaphors.  <br /> <br />But the Loxian songs do stand out on this album, and it's a pity that there are only three. Be it the sheer invention of the language or the premises that are depicted in it, Enya and her team appear to have been intrigued somewhat by Roma Ryan's conception, which seems to have revealed to them undiscovered creative spaces. That is a treat precisely because it's what listeners know Enya does best - charting new creative realms and building on them with her music. It's in the exploration of new worlds, which always appeals to the imagination, that Enya and her song-writing duo shine. `Less Than A Pearl' is an assured and quietly sublime opening, matched by a relatively epic conclusion on `Water Shows the Hidden Heart' that plays comfortably with its occasional classical-sounding tinges. `The River Sings' is perhaps the best track on the album, absolutely riveting and displaying sheer adventure in the mix of beats and vocals. More importantly, it shows what's distinctive about Enya, and that quality surely comes in no small part from her experiences with Clannad - which isn't a bad thing at all, as `Watermark' and `Shepherd Moons' showed. It's a wonderful feeling when you know a song was simply inspired in its composition, and `The River Sings' celebrates that with an easy, comfortable and sparklingly energetic groove. In addition, one should not forget `Drifting', the only instrumental piece, which is a master class in how the unremarkable can be remarkably stirring. One doesn't feel the sting of pity from the lack of a trademark piano tune typically featured in her other albums.   <br /> <br />But even after an affecting finish, one is still inclined to think that `Amarantine' isn't quite amaranthine (and yes - it'sspelt with an `h'). While not quite as unmemorable as `A Day Without Rain' threatened to be, a disturbingly contemporary creative headspace seems to have taken over - indeed since her previous work - depriving `Amarantine' of the unique sound that's come to be associated with Enya - romanticised, ethereal echoes of the past that allow olden beauty to reach across the centuries and become truly transcendent by resonating with our hearts in our time. There isn't even really anything here that bears her beloved Celtic touch, and that is woeful. `Amarantine' is, quite pitifully, less than a pearl, and little more than a memory of what's been done much, much more proficiently before. <br /> <br />
0060764899|5.0|C.S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fantastic book that combines great story telling and charming style while engrossing readers in an intriguing mythical world.  Though it is numbered as book two in The Chronicles of Narnia series, C.S. Lewis wrote it first and therefore meant it to be read before book one, for it introduces the world of Narnia and launches readers on the beginning of an exciting journey leaving you wanting more.  Though the style of writing and almost non-existent use of difficult vocabulary ostensibly targets the book toward a younger audience, fans of all ages can enjoy this timeless classic, and perhaps older audiences will grasp the deeper underlying message. <br /> <br />The book begins with the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, being sent to live in a mansion with a fabulously rich, mysterious, and old professor because of the German air raids in London during World War II.  While the four kids explore the house, Lucy, the youngest, first stumbles upon the doorway to the world of Narnia-an ancient and gigantic wardrobe.  Eventually, all the children go through the wardrobe together, and they begin their adventures in Narnia.  It is there we see two distinct sides of good and evil:  the White Witch and her minions and those for Aslan the lion.  The White Witch has spread an ethereal winter that has lasted for over one hundred years, and it is only the coming of Aslan that this winter spell can be broken and the White Witch defeated. <br /> <br />C.S. Lewis brings a wealth of intriguing and interesting characters into his book.  Upon meeting the characters of Narnia-mostly various animals-you become automatically attached to them.  There are by no means \\"fuzzy little cute things\\" you would expect a children's book to have, but noble, smart, wise, and humanlike.  Animal lovers of all sorts will enjoy this book that much more, as will mythical creature buffs.  C.S. Lewis also brings in centaurs, unicorns, dryads, and naiads among others into the story, along with numerous evil creatures such as wraiths, ogres, and many other things that I will not mention here. <br /> <br />The plot of the book is engaging and relentless.  I found it almost impossible to put down the novel at the end of each chapter, a cruel but effective ploy to grasp the reader's attention throughout the book.  The first initial peeks into Narnia leaves you wanting more, and upon permanently entering there, you are just as eager as the four children to explore and find out more about the strange, mysterious, but beautiful new world. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to any fan of fiction.  Readers will never forget the magic of entering into the world of Narnia for the first time and the wonder that it instills.  This book incorporates everything that an epic novel should have.  It successfully pulls you into a magical world that is totally believable, provides engaging characters and events, and captivates big and small audiences from start to finish.  There is no doubt that children and adults alike will enjoy this book, and just like the Pevensie children, will leave Narnia hoping only to come back again.

0525948023|5.0|I am very selective reader. I only read those books that can help me to get out of the experience of \\"I\\"(I am body). I only read books of those people who have direct experience of Truth, the real SELF. When I read this author's book \\" The Power of Now\\", I was able to remain aware in my dream some time, that much strong awareness current carries his words. I haven't seen Mr. Eckhart Tolle but still strongly believe that he have died before death that's true. That mean he is the person who have experience of death of mind before natural body death. What call Nirvikalp Samadhi in Indian scripture, the breathless, pulse less, thoughtless state of Absolute Consciousness, the 100% absence of mind. <br />I am enjoying each and every word of his book The New Earth. Its simply great truth, I love to give you guarantee for this book, it will definitely help you to shift your consciousness from your personal \\"I\\" to \\"SELF\\". It will make you more conscious and aware about our unconscious mechanism of mind. If you are really truth seeker want to understand who we are or who I am? You will love it. It's presenting universal Truth with the present days example, its modern holy scripture in layman language with full analysis of human ego and how its function. Once we become aware about that our ego loses the unconscious control. <br />Just read and experience the light of knowledge within. Best of luck, thanks you for reading this. <br />
0792840461|5.0|Reading the reviews of others here, I'm beginning to wonder where we children of the 60's went wrong. In the spirit of examining this movie, I ask: Have you kids no sprit of adventure, no instincts to rebellion? Thomas Crown exhibited in spades the exact opposite of the conformity and benign contentment that I sense with some of the reviewers of this flick. In short, this guy was ALIVE!! Sure, some of the dialogue, etc. is dated. So will that of 2005 be in thirty years, I assure you. But Mr. Crown was more alive in his Boston-Brahmin prime than, I suspect, many of the reviewers are in theirs. Or maybe its just the times--we seem to be living in the '50's, redux. Sad. Anyway, buy this movie already and learn. Better yet, make yourselves a nice cold martini [if you know how] and get into the spirit of this. If you have a nice, sexy-icy mistress available [Ms Dunaway, where are you?] then you're ready for the ultimate Tommy Crowne experience. Go for it.

038532653X|4.0|Michael was desperately trying to be the big boy that his father wanted him to be and, in actuality, needed him to be at that time. His dad certainly would have liked to have been there more for Michael-he understood that this was an especially difficult time for Michael since the family had just moved into a new home in a new neighborhood, however, with Michaels' new born baby sister's life in peril because of a heart abnormality his father and mother's concerns were understandably elsewhere. <br /> <br />This led Michael to being left alone quite a bit with nothing left to do but explore the grounds of his new home, which included a dilapidated old garage he had been warned about entering because it was so unsafe. <br /> <br />When Michael finally succumbs to his curiosity he finds Skellig living in the back of the garage. Michael is never quite sure who or what Skellig really is. He is described in the story as dirty and \\"sick to death of everything\\", living off eating bugs, spiders and anything else he can find; however, he also appears to be very much alive, caring and quite intelligent; moreover, there seems to be a large hump on his back that appears to actually be wings. <br /> <br />After finding Skellig, Michael reaches out to another friend, Mina, a young girl his own age. He eventually brings her to the garage, so she can meet Skellig and to confirm for Michael that Skellig really does exist--he is not something made up in Michael's mind. <br /> <br />Eventually, Michael's father relates to his son a dreamlike experience he had while in the hospital. His father tells his son of an unusual character who came in during the night and picked up and gently held his little sister; moreover, when his father further describes the appearance of this character, Michael realizes that the character can be no one other than Skellig. <br /> <br />What makes this story different than the vast majority of stories written for young people is there are never really any black and white answers given, even at the end. The reader goes on the journey with Michael, and in the end, the reader must decide who Skellig is, what is his purpose, and what role did he really play in the life and death drama of Michael's little sister.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|i was amazed when i first got this cd. I thought it was very good. I had to listen to it a couple times to get used to it and then i loved it. I thought the cd would be better if daron didnt sing as much but he didnt do too bad. <br /> <br />attack- good chorus and fast paced. (4.5/5) <br />dreaming- very good but not best on album. (4.5/5) <br />kill rock 'n roll- i loved this song. daron actually sang well in this. (5/5 <br />hypnotize- great song and perfect for their first hit song on this album(5/5 <br />stealing society- i likeed this song. i thought daron did a very good job in his part. (4/5) <br />tentative -this is probably my second favorite song. i loved it (5/5) <br />U-Fig -kinda wierd but i liked it a lot. (4/5) <br />Holy Mountains- Great song and one of their best slower songs they've made (5/5) <br />Vicinity of Obscenity- my favorite song on the album because of serjs weird voices (5/5) <br />Shes like herion- this song is like violent pornography but not as good. (4/5) <br />lonely day- i dont really care for this song, one of darons worst song. (3.5/5) <br />soldier side- loved it and great that it was last while the intro of it in mezmerize (5/5) <br /> <br />this was there second best cd they have made in my opinion: <br />1st- System of a down (first) <br />2nd- Hypnotize <br />3rd- Toxicity <br />4th- Mezmerize <br />5th- Steal this album <br />all of these albums are amazing! soad has not made a bad song ever
B0007GAERG|3.0|This album is okay, and better (more interesting) than Charmbracelet, but no comparison to Butterfly. <br /> <br />The best performances are We Belong Together, Circles, and Fly Like a Bird.  It's Like That, Shake it Off and I Wish I Knew, are close seconds.  The rest leaves something to be desired, and I don't think compares well to the soundtracks on Butterfly. <br /> <br />For example, the vocals on \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Stay the Night\\", and \\"Your Girl\\" sound very forced, and actually annoying.  She's yelling instead of singing.  However, she saves herself with \\"Circles\\", \\"Joy Ride\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\", and somewhat so on \\"I Wish I Knew\\" (actually, Fly reminds me a lot of her early days, with a powerful, gospel voice).  The vocals in those songs don't sound so forced, and she sings more than yells.  Perhaps because they're a little slower, she has time to breath between notes.  (IMO, slower, gospel-like ballads are her vocal fortes). <br /> <br />However, almost all of the collaborations (Say Somethin, Get your Number, One and Only, etc) are just plain boring (possibly more due to the particular collaborator than to Carey).  It's not surprising none have been released yet.  If they are, they would have to be remixed to be received well by a discerning audience.  None has a really good beat. <br /> <br />A Mariah fan might want the album.  It's not bad at all, just not *very* good...and no Butterfly.

Do bad guys secretely build  toxic dumping plants in the desert? How does an American confederate armoured ship get lost in Mali Africa? Are all  American ambassadors idiots? All these challenging questions will be answered throughout this movie that was obviously made for little children. (SARR)
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I have not been a System of a Down fan for very long, but ever since I purchased Mezmerize, I was hooked. From then on I have been eagerly anticipating the release of this second part of the double pack: Hypnotize. This is a very good album, despite what some long-time SOAD fans may say. <br /> <br />Now, I have listened to Toxicity and have noticed that Serj Tankian does about 90% of the vocals where Daron Malaikan quietly sits in the back doing superb guitar riffs, and adds the occasional word to back Serj up. This is not the case however with Mezmerize and Hypnotize. He even sings Lost in Hollywood in its entirety with Serj in the background, as if he was the lead singer. A lot of people hate his voice, and I don't totally disagree with them, but I think Daron adds a difference and variety to the songs, even though his voice isn't the best I have ever heard. <br /> <br />Now Hypnotize: <br /> <br />1. Attack- 9/10 Very good intro to a very good album. A bit like Prison Song. I like how there are fast parts and slow parts. <br />2. Dreaming- 9/10 Powerful song, I like the rollercoaster-like chorus (the \\"body parts\\" part). <br />3. Kill Rock 'N Rock- 8/10 Serj and Daron harmonize very beutifully. The \\"eat all the grass\\" part is kind of catchy. <br />4. Hypnotize- 8/10 The first released single on this album. I had heard it several times on the radio. Once again, great singing by Daron and Serj. <br />5. Stealing Society- 9/10 Great lyrics and melody. <br />6. Tentative- 8/10 Great anti-war song, which is a big part of SOAD's style. I like the \\"Ah, ah, ooh\\" part. <br />7. U-Fig- 7/10 Too much of the same note over and over. Not a horrible song, though. <br />8. Holy Mountains- 8/10 Very emotional song. Apparently refers the Armenian Genocide. (All of SOAD is Armenian) <br />9. Vicinity of Obscenity- 10/10 Very catchy and funny. Talks about banannas and Terracatta pie. A bit like \\"This Cocaine...\\" from Mezmerize. <br />10. She's Like Heroin- 7/10 Kind of pointless song about selling ass for herion and wearing little dresses. <br />11. Lonely Day- 9.5 Awesome vocals by Daron Malaikan that really show his potential as a singer. Reminds me a bit of \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" where I mentioned that he does all of the lyrics. The very last seconds sound familiar <br />12. Soldier Side- 10/10 Great lyrics about soldiers (maybe specifically in Iraq) who know they might not come back home. Awesome way to end the album and blends nicely into the Soldier Side Intro of Mezmerize. The words at the end definetely also sound familiar... <br /> <br />In short, Hypnotize is much more emotional and dark than its previous counterpart. The artwork of both cd cases can be interlocked to form one huge piece of art which makes sense; this being the 2nd half of a musical experience, not just a seperate album. If you own Mezmerize, then definitely get this.

B00005JNQA|5.0|I heard and read some bad reviews besides I never liked Nicole Kidman so I thought it would be just another so-so thriller. And I was pleasantly surprised watching it as I wanted the film to last as long as possible - I was enjoying it that much. I liked every scene, every dialogue (they all were brilliant and very living), every line.<br />This is one of the best political thrillers I've ever seen but there were something more to the film so I can say it's not just a thriller. It's a very tender and sensitive story about two life-beaten persons who are trying to cope with life's difficulties and find love maybe. We can't speak definately about love here, because everything remained rather hazy in the picture, but I found a lot of love there - much more than in any regular love story. Kidman and Penn were so convincing in their roles, and Sydney Pollack executed such an elaborate and delicate directing, so that for me this is one of the most truthful movies about love between two people, although there are no love scenes and even no kisses. It's so rare these days we get a chance to see something really worthy like this. It's the exact case when we can say for sure that the film was done by real professionals. Don't miss this one of the best movies of the year. Bravo, Mr. Pollack!
B00009AOBI|5.0|Director Peter Bogdanovich's take on the true story of the craniofacially deformed Rocky Dennis is a moving motion picture experience that doesn't manipulate the viewer with treacly schmaltz.  Instead, MASK is an inspirationally uplifting look at a boy and his mother, and how they overcome the odds and make life meaningful and important.  Cher is wonderful as the mother, a drug addicted biker chick who nonetheless is a supportive and caring parent; Eric Stoltz, unrecognizable under the Oscar winning make-up, is stoic and poignant as the physically challenged yet mentally competent young man; Sam Elliott brings his macho earthiness to the role of Gar, Cher's main squeeze who truly loves the boy; and an ingenuish Laura Dern is touching as Rocky's blind girlfriend.  With the reinstatement of Bruce Springsteen's music, the movie moves along with strong individual sequences and a three hanky ending.  A brilliant movie.
B000BYY0RY|5.0|I am a new US Kylie fan, and have slowly been collecting her CD's and DVD's. I absolutely cannot believe she has not been embraced in the US. Only her gay fans know how great she is (so cutting edge).  <br /> <br />I took the advice of a previous post and ordered this DVD through the Canadian website at the fastest shipping possible...still saved $$$ over buying it in the US at Super Saver shipping.  <br /> <br />The show she put on beats out everything she has ever done. Kylie keeps topping herself over and over, getting more and more creative and running her image and business like a pro. I wish folks would stop comparing her to Madonna. Although similar, Kylie is an artist unto herself.  <br /> <br />Everything is here, plus some glimpses of things that may have slipped by new Kylie fan's eyes. The \\"Smiley Kylie\\" section is a personal favorite, as it sounds a bit like \\"Hits + 1\\", only better produced. The musicians and the arranger did a great job making old hits sound new and interesting (even though, as is, they are interesting). The energy that was on the \\"Live in Sydney\\" DVD but lacking on the \\"Fever\\" tour are back again on \\"Showgirl\\", plus some.  <br /> <br />Song after song, this DVD does NOT dissapoint. The extras are worth the money alone. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for everyone...Kylie fans and newbies alike.
B00005JO1J|5.0|\\"The Sound Of Music,\\" while not my favorite Broadway show, is probably one of the best movie adaptations of a broadway musical...until now.  I admit, going into \\"Rent\\", I had high expectations and I was a little nervous.  However all of my expectations were surpassed by this incredible film.  That's right...this is a film in every aspect of the word.  The direction, cinematography, performances and script were all first rate.  Kudos to Mr. Columbus.  That's not to say that there aren't a few flaws, minor as they may be.  The film is set in 1989 and there is mention of the movie \\"Thelma and Loiuse\\" which had not been released yet.  Also, everything in the \\"second act\\" does seem kind of rushed, but the film being at 2 hours and fifteen minutes the audience does not feel cheated.  All in all this is a magnificent film, not just for musical theater geeks like myself, but also for anyone with a heart and the passion to dream and not let anyone take those dreams away.  Do yourself a favor this Christmas and pay your rent.

B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains is better than Nirvana, IMO. They are smarter, Layne has a better voice than Cobain, Cantrell is a way better guitar player than Cobain, and the songs are darker and better.  <br /> <br />Dirt, to many critics, was their musical peak. I don't agree with that. But this was and is an absolutely astonishing album. Layne's voice comes through and chills the soul. From the sludgy heaviness of the first track, Them Bones, to the next track's riffs reminiscent of AIC's first album, Facelift, to the insane Sikman, to the beautiful Rooster, to the heavy finale Would?, this album just delivers. Lyrically, this is the band's peak. You are not given a break in this album.

B000BJS4SU|4.0|john mayer is a smart man.  throw together a couple of pop records...make some bread...get some chicks...score a couple grammies...and then, when the future looks protected, make a cd of music he is passionate about. <br /> <br />this live cd is john mayer's love child with his mistress \\"passion.\\"  it seems to me, though, that while john was moving his new kid from the rocking chair to the crib he dropped the little tyke on his head. <br /> <br />john mayer moved to quickly with his new trio.  this group should have let their music simmer to give it the grittiness and rawness that we were expecting.  moments of \\"magic\\" with the trio, moments where the music being produced seems as a single beam of light and not a roman candle, are few and far in between.  the groove is there, the musicianship is above-average, but the trio isn't as tight as it should be. <br /> <br />all that said...BUY THIS CD!   <br /> <br />ten years down the road we are going to experience the evolution of this trio through epic recordings and realize that we were part of the beginning. <br />
B00005JO1J|5.0|A movie that not only has great casting and plot but excellent soundtrack.  If you love the songs and the play you will love this movie.  If you haven't really been around either, my advise would be to go see this movie.  It was perfectly casted and transitioned well to big screen.  You will begin to get caught up in the story line from people that battle drug addictions, to love lost, to death, to friendship.  A must see for any movie fan who wants their money's worth!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|\\"The Matrix Reloaded,\\" the sequel to 1999's sleeper hit, is a better film than the original. Like the original, though, it is boring for the most part, and features a lot more of quasi-religious babble that seriously detracted from the original. On the plus-side though, there is a lot more action in this one, including a spectacular car-chase-crash sequence.<br /><br />The acting hasn't improved either. Laurence Fishburne does the best job as Morpheus. The rest of the cast does just alright, although Monica Bellucci (\\"The Passion of the Christ\\") does good in her interesting little scene as Persephone.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent film that will only appeal to fans of the original film.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+
B00005JO1P|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie.  Was it going to be singing or was it going to be Johnny's life story?  It was more than either of those.  You get sucked into Johnny's life.  They set up his story on how he ended up on his road to music but the story really takes off once he makes his record and goes on tour.  It shows his highlights and his low times.  It doesn't hold back it doesn't try and show Johnny in a one deminsional light it shows him as human.  I came out of the movie theater having a new found respect for June and Johnny.  Not because they made it big but because they were human and had their tough times, but lived on to make it one hell of a story.  My advise if you catch a movie this winter.  This is one to see.

B000BM6AVA|3.0|i downloaded this album, and played it in my car for a few days. i own the others, except steal this album, which i guess is a little ironic. but enough about me. if you do the right thing and buy hypnotize, you may find that it was actually the wrong thing to do, as it is only half an album. <br /> <br />guitarist DM obviously sings more on this album, which has not gone down well with most longtime fans. while serj has a greater depth of emotion in his voice, DM's vocal psychosis contributes to the edginess of the band. it has been suggested he shut up most of the time and let serj get on with it. <br /> <br />as for lyrical and musical quality, soad are still making strong political statements, which is good. what is not good, in my opinion, is the annoying societal-satirical rap-ranting they are known for. jeeebers, they just sound so....   ...american.  <br /> <br />i'm sure you could make one good album out of mezmerize and hypnotize. load up your ipods. kia ora.
B000002NJS|5.0|I know I'm ol'school and I still have the cassette of this album.  But I still love playing it from time to time.  This Madonna album showed how much she matured as a woman and showed she could go from the 'material girl' to the 'material mom'.  Songs I enjoyed was \\"Swim\\", \\"Ray of Light\\", \\"Frozen\\", \\"Little Star\\", \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\" and my favorite track \\"The Power of Goodbye\\".
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I was first introduced to Michael Buble a couple of years ago when his career was first beginning to soar.  It was very obvious that this young man's talents would bring him far.  My wife and I were very fortunate to see him in person at the Folly Theater in Kansas City approximately 18 months ago and our high esteem for Michael was solidified in granite --- we would be fans of his for life.  This live CD/DVD album is a \\"must own\\".  It is superbly recorded and mixed.  It will give you the impetus to seek out and attend one of his live performances.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|Thanks to a national catastrophe that is 9.11, Enya's A Day Without Rain soared on the charts selling some 7 million copies, with some clever mixing of Only Time which saw sentimental Americans embracing the song, giving her her first ever American Top 10 hit.<br /><br />Now some 4 years later, Enya returns with Armarantine which fans have been waiting for with bated breath. The result? Amarantine is brief and typical Enya, but the fact is that most tracks suffer from the fate of being rather indistinctly slow and unmemorable. And it has finally come to show that Enya's formula might already be wearing too thin for its own good.<br /><br />However, all is not lost. The sublime and uplifting The River Sings is good reason why we still hold faith in Enya giving us something spirited. And there is Sumiregusa, the Japanese haiku-inspired track used in a Panasonic ad that drove fans to a frenzy speculating her new album would be out soon last year. Having said that, the track is beautifully serene and placid. The instrumental Drifting is befitting as part of a score for some major motion picture due to its lushness.<br /><br />Amarantine isn't going any where near Shepherd Moons or any of her previous albums but it'd still give Enya a decent run anyway. Not bad for a woman who sold 50 million records by shielding away from any limelight and putting out records at her own whim and fancy.
B000002TP7|5.0|I know what you're thinking. \\"Eggplant giving a hip-hop album not only higher than one star, but FIVE?!?\\" People, people. This is not just a hip-hop album. \\"Ill Communication\\" offers not only GOOD hip-hop, but funk, punk, rock, jazz, fusion, et cetera, in one fresh-sounding album that's always good to listen to. This just might be my favorite Beastie Boys album (and I have all but \\"To The Five Boroughs\\"). <br /> <br />It may be eleven years old now, but \\"Ill Communication\\" may as well have been recorded yesterday. It doesn't sound dated at all. The hip-hop songs, like all of the Beasties' work, is actually damn good and fun (Good rap! Who'da thunk it?), with catchy samples and beats (check out the infectious flutes in \\"Sure Shot\\" and \\"Flute Loop\\", not to mention that funky bassline in \\"Root Down\\"), you also get some nice, mellow instrumental numbers (\\"Ricky's Theme\\", \\"Bobo On The Corner\\", et cetera), two energetic punk songs (\\"Tough Guy\\" and the humorous \\"Heart Attack Man\\"), and all kinds of other assorted influence, here in one nice little package... let's not forget the album's biggest hit, the rocker \\"Sabotage\\", with its memorable music video. <br /> <br />Buy it if you're sick of the Kayne Wests of the world. No wonder I listened to the old tape I had of this so religiously back in seventh grade.

B00003CXAW|5.0|The greatest of all horror/fantasy epics, the grand-daddy of them all, finally arrives on DVD....probably the most important film of all time yet to get released on the shiny 5\\" disc finally is yours to own and cherish. <br /> <br />Those of us who have seen KONG in the past decades in truncated, dirty, grimy form, can truly appreciate the painstaking, gorgeous restoration Warner Bothers has lavished upon another of their priceless assets. (No, WB didn't make KONG, but they bought it, along with thousands of other movies when they purchased Turner Broadcasting System in 1996).  <br /> <br />This film has not only never looked better, but it is beautifully packaged, and has a 2nd disc with extras that are among the best ever created. The 7-part 2 1/2 hour documentary on the making of the film (PRODUCTION 601) may be the best made-for-DVD extras of all time. <br /> <br />Don't take my word for it...Do a google search and see the unanimous rave reviews for this masterpiece. Forget fabricated crap like Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS, or Lucas' boring STAR WARS III. This is the real deal for fans of cinematic fantasy. <br /> <br />Don't miss it.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|You should immediately order this DVD set with the Amazon discount (P.S. Free shipping came to me within a week!!) <br />This is an amazing concert DVD - great sound, wonderfully filmed, with amazing performances. I found myself applauding, idiotically and gleefully after each selection - while watching alone at home! I have followed Clapton for decades and I have never seen/heard him play like this. I know these guys just stand there and play, but they do so with such power and joy for each other and the music they made long ago.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|If Daron stuck to singing limited background vocals, I would give this 5 stars. He's a great writer but man, I can't imagine why no one told him to just get a grip and give the singing up. He sounds like he has marbles in his mouth and incessantly whines. Serj of course is the bomb and the band kicks butt.  <br />Definately recommended!
B0009PVZWI|5.0|This album i think is the best by the foo fighters followed by the color and shape.. Best of you is a great song but my favorite is either DOA or no way back those are two left out songs alot of people thought that no way back should have been the single but the producer picks it no the foo fighters or the ppl. But i give this albm five stars cuz IT IS THE BEST by the way i met dave, taylor, nate, and chris at oakland californias concert it was great but i don't want to brag , later
B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles are more then just well known.For the most part the younger audience doesn't know them well, but still knows of them.<br />The most familiar song for the younger crowd is<br />\\"Yellow Submarine\\".So many not know of this album, but love this song.As it was over shadowed by SGT.Pepper.<br /><br />Overall i think this stacks up to any other Beatles album and beats it.The songs are so versatile and the song make up keeps shape shifting through out this album.All the songs seem so far apart that this makes for an even greater replay value.<br />The string quartet done in \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" leaves a haunting effect.The violins are very soothing, but eerie as can be.<br />\\"Taxman\\" is rockish and has some cool ambience in the backround.<br />You can hear clanging sounds and voices.\\"I'm Only Sleeping\\"<br />is another John Lennon mastered song wich should of gotten more radio play.<br /><br />It's good to know these songs were remastered as i have owned the cassett for ages now and it lacks.This gives you the full experience in a richer easier to listen to sound.If you have a messed up speaker you'll notice a diiferent dimention on each song.As the way the songs have been recorded they may sing in one speaker and play their instrament in the other.(Thats the way it was recorded you're not hearing things)<br /><br />Ringo gets a center spot in \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and George Harrison does the vocals in \\"Love You To\\".(Harrison does some vocals in some other tracks too)<br />\\"For No One\\" is a well known Paul song.The horn played in this song is awsome and well down, the vocals fit so nicely with every part of this song.<br /><br />This was a turning point in the days of The Beatles.They were finally converting to hippies and rebels.They soon became known as mature and had some wel defined songs.<br /><br />Revolver is a must have album Beatles fan or not you'll hopefully find one decent song.The tones are so different every type of person can enjoy and appreciate this wonderful album.
B000BJS4OY|4.0|The packaging is sub-par, but I didn't buy it for the packaging, I bought it for the music.<br /><br />The \\"making of\\" DVD is good, I enjoyed it. I probably won't watch it again, although there are some live tracks on the disk that I'll watch again.<br /><br />The remastered \\"Born to Run\\" is very good. It is not dramatically different, but I would not want it to be. It is cleaner, the instruments are clearer and better defined, but listening to it casually you might not notice much different. At least I didn't.<br /><br />The live show from London is excellent. It's live Bruce, it's good live Bruce, and it was well recorded. You can find fault with it here or there if you want to, but if you do that you're missing the point. It's a prime piece of rock history. I'm glad I bought the collection for this disk alone.<br /><br />Who the f%#k is Justin Timberlake?
B000001ZS3|5.0|Oxygene~ Jean Michel Jarre is an increndible electronic music album and could be compared with Kraftwerks Autobahn in the sense that they legitimized the use keyboards in music creation and composition. Jarre shows his genius by himself playing all the instruments and it is like being allowed a glimpse into the early world of synht music. The soft sounds of the analogue synths of the 70's is so nice to hear and one wonders (sometimes aloud) which sounds come from which keyboard. Is it the A.R.P., the A.K.S. or some other early keyboard. I would in fact call this his magnum opus and his debut album is so much better in many aspects then his later work.  Oxygene number 4 is the best of the lot and who can forget the music video that came with this tune and had a bunch of penguins in it and the antartic landscape. I can not say enough good things about the synth sounds and I verily feel like the synths of the 70's had a sound that can not be matched by synths even of today. This is also music that is electronic yet manages to speak to the common man something that some of his later recordings fail and become way to avant-garde and strange for instance the recording zoolook that only speaks to hardcore avant-garde fans and some of his later works that sound a bit cheesy like the track london kid.
0393061310|5.0|It seems wherever I go with a nonfiction book not remotely related to this one, somebody brings up this book.  It just happened on the plane yesterday.   <br /> <br />I agree that at some points this book gets a little too detailed for those only casually interested in cultural anthropology or anything agricultural.  And, sometimes he glosses over some issues a little too quick (we are, after all, talking about a \\"history of the world\\" book in 500 pages).  But it is very interesting at places to the point you will be underlining or taking notes, even if you are not in college/grad school.  He makes an overarching argument and he makes it cohesive.  One of the best books in the last ten years.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Despite not recording on a load of fancy equipment (he mainly used the good-old Shure SM-57 on most instruments) nor having the benefit of a defined recording space (Illinois was recorded in several different locations and at different times over the course of four months), Sufjan Stevens has once again created another brilliant album with his second entry in his great states project. The full title of the release is Sufjan Stevens Invites You To Come On Feel The Illinoise, and like his previous Michigan the long title of the album (nor the epic song titles) don't feel overstated at all. After that last release, I told a friend that Stevens was easily one of my favorite singer/songwriters under the age of 30, but given his output over the course of the past couple years, I can state the above without giving any sort of age qualification. Stevens is simply one of the most talented artists creating music right now, period.<br /><br />There's sure to be a critical backlash at some point, but you won't even begin hear it from me yet. Despite another staggering number of songs (twenty two) and album running length (almost seventy-five minutes), Stevens has carved out another solid set of tracks that probably have even more depth and scope than anything he's done before. While he's always been known for his adventurous instrumentation, he goes even further on Illinois, hanging up guitars in large part in favor of horns, chromatic instruments (chimes, bells, piano), and woodwinds. The result is a release that feels like the work of Stevens while also moving in completely new directions.<br /><br />The first four tracks on the release give a perfect idea of the overall scope of the release, veeing wildly from the quiet and building flutes/piano of \\"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois\\" to the horns/flute/vocal fanfare of \\"The Black Hawk War...\\" As if those weren't enough, the two part titled track of \\"Come On! Feel The Illinoise!\\" might very well be one of the best tracks that Stevens has ever done (and that's saying a lot). After opening with a Vince Guaraldi-esque piano tickle, horns burst forth with a hearty rhythm section, bells, vocals from Stevens and a backup chorus as the track progresses from a bright ode to the Chicago's Worlds Fair to a more introspective and reflective second half (with one of the most inventive in-track shifts since Franz Ferdinand's \\"Take Me Out\\").<br /><br />\\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" tackles one of the more infamous serial killers in the history of the United States, and Stevens turns in a sparse vocal track that's empathetic without being crass and contains one of the most heartbreaking vocal melodies I've heard in some time. From there, the album keeps jumping around, from the banjo and string driven \\"Jacksonville\\" to the epic and grandiose \\"Chicago,\\" which moves between quiet electric piano to orchestral and choral flourishes that sweep you up like like the embodiment of the city itself.<br /><br />As with Michigan, Stevens filters the history of the state through a very personal point-of-view. He touches on things on everything from nationally-known landmarks like the Sears Tower (which becomes the \\"Seer's Tower\\" in a haunting, windswept piece) to more obscure figures on \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\" (in which he weaves a very personal narrative for one of the more emotionally-touching tracks on the release). \\"The Man Of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts\\" is the only track on the entire album that is electric-guitar driven, yet coming halfway through the album, the alternately loud and quiet anthem feels just about right as a step in the journey.<br /><br />On first listen, the sheer variety of musical styles feels a bit overwhelming at times, and some of the short interludes seem a bit haphazard as well. Yet, despite the inclusion of \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From The Dead!! Ahhhh!\\" (which sounds like pure David Axelrod orchestral-funk) and album closer \\"OutOf Egypt, Into The Great Laugh Of Mankind...\\" (which channels the work of Steve Reich with some soft phasing patterns), the album reveals itself after several listens as another rewarding, personal listen from Stevens. After all, Illinois itself has the unique contradiction of laying smack dab in the middle of the United States, yet also teems with one of the most metropolitan cities in the country. In a single state, blue collar mixes with white collar while great plains find themselves swallowed up by sprawling suburbs and huge steel and glass skyscrapers with burned-out housing projects sitting in their shadows. If those things don't call for a varied musical response, I don't know what does, and with the quality of his first two releases in the series, I can only hope that Stevens continues with his adventurous and overwhelming musical project.<br /><br />(from almost cool music reviews)oser \\"Out Of Egypt, Into The Great Laugh Of Mankind...\\" (which channels the work of Steve Reich with some soft phasing patterns), the album reveals itself after several listens as another rewarding, personal listen from Stevens.

B00005JOHI|5.0|I am not worthy of writing a review of this film, but I MUST try.<br /><br />It seems like only yesterday Codemaster Talon (my genius sister and fellow Amazon reviewer) and myself were sitting in a darkened theater watching previews before some film or other, and saw a fleeting glimpse of yet another Jane Austin inspired film. That was my initial reaction, \\"Oh no, not ANOTHER one...\\". And yet, within that short time I was intrigued. The acting looking competent, and the cinematography absolutely breath-taking. \\"I'll see it for the cinematography alone,\\" I commented to my companion.<br /><br />Now I don't pretend to be half the Jane Austin fan that Codemaster Talon is. I don't pretend to be some kind of literary higher critic or the absolute authority on historical accuracy and proper period acting. I do however, know a good story when I see one. Pride and Prejudice as a story in all it's versions holds a very special place in my heart. You see at it's core it is the story of two very similar personality types who are monstrously incompatible on the surface, and perfect compliments deep down.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet is an introvert who acts the extrovert, a whimsical person who is practical deep down, a genius who cares more about her friends' happiness than impressing others, and wishes for true love more than riches. She's a young woman who uses her feelings to deal with the world but most treasures her intuition. Darcy is a person who has all his feelings buried deep down. He's an introvert who keeps to himself unless compelled to action. He's logical and analytical, but treasures his feelings above all. He's blunt with his feelings, because so few people understand them. He's arrogant and proud, but courageous, and noble. In short he's the exact opposite of Elizabeth in every way save one. They are both people who live in their own universe separate from the rest of the world. And they are both VERY stubborn and judgmental.<br /><br />I've seen the old version of this story with Sir Laurence Olivier as Darcy and Greer Garson as Elizabeth. I've seen the gold-standard A&E version which caused such an uproar with it's amazing dialog and acting. I have never seen anything like this. Never before has the true heart and soul of Liz and Darcy been on display. Never before could I see clearly expressed WHY  they fell in love with each other. In fact, never before could I see a real sign that they HAD fallen in love with each other. Now I see it.<br /><br />A movie is more than just acting with some music and sound effects tossed in, captured through a hand-held camera (despite what Indy film buffs may have told you). A real movie uses the acting to further the dialog, the dialog to further the action, the music to further the moment captured by the lens. Everything pushes  to express feelings and emotions that grab a hold of you and don't let go. I mentioned that the preview for this movie intrigued me because of the cinematography, but I had NO IDEA what was yet to come.<br /><br />Painting with Color, Drawing with Light<br /><br />The title of this movie appears in a ray of sunlight. The first few minutes take us inside of the Bennet house with a genius that reminded me of the camera-work of The Magnificent Ambersons' greatest shot. And it only gets better. This is not showy camera-work for it's own sake. Everything has a point in this movie. Those opening minutes told multiple stories at once. Those first time I saw this movie beginning made me think first of the  standing of the household (as the lived-in and somewhat decayed nature of the estate was quite apparent), then of the personality of the main character (carrying a book and inside her own world despite all the hustle and bustle around her), and then of the personality of everyone else inside the house, as each person's body language, voice and activity summarized their personality in a snapshot.<br /><br />As the film progressed I witnessed a country party quite unlike anything I've seen in a Jane Austin film before. The party was lively and ecstatic and looked like FUN. And when Darcy and his friend came to the party we could quite quickly see how everyone else was a country bumpkin compared to them (something that was never so clear to me before). More than that, again the use of camera angles and body language spoke beyond the dialog to hint at things unsaid. \\"Interesting,\\" I thought. \\"This movie is going to be interesting.\\" Then came the first scene where I honestly was mentally agasp with the question \\"How did they do that?\\". Liz and Jane are having a sister-to-sister conversation under the bed covers late at night and the perspective of the camera is the the arm of one sister, then it switches back to the other sister's perspective. \\"Where's the camera?\\", was all I could think. Not good camera use, GREAT.<br /><br />There were three moments in this film that  took my breath away (and while it was certainly impressive and added enormously to the picture, the dance between Darcy and Elizabeth where everyone else disappears {an effect executed marvelously here} is not one of them). The moments were these:<br /><br />The Proposal<br /><br />Firstly, Darcy's famous proposal. Normally portrayed somewhat arrogantly on Darcy's part, here it is played with passion, and we can see his heartache. Nay, we can FEEL his heartache. The whole scene happens in the rain, outdoors, with Liz and Darcy starting somewhat apart, and, as he proposes and she rejects him with more and more fury, they gradually get closer and closer until by the end of the scene their faces are nearly touching. I could FEEL the magnetism between the characters. I could SEE for the first time, that it was not HIM that she was rejecting (though she thought she was) but his ACTIONS. Despite her words, she was clearly drawn to him, absorbed in his personality. Though for so long she acted indifferent toward him, seemingly not caring, she was in fact almost obsessed with him. Yeah, I got all that from one scene.<br /><br />On top of the World<br /><br />Okay, this was it, the moment when I knew that I didn't just like this movie, I had fallen head-over-heels-in-love! While there are many splendid moments of wide-screen wide-angle shots (YES!), and some super-nice super-close-ups (the beauty is almost too much for my eyes!), this scene truly takes the cake. It starts with Lizzy in a carriage, the camera  on her eyes as sunlight and shadow dance across them. Then, the camera cuts to a STUNNING  shot of Elizabeth standing at the edge of a cliff with the wind blowing against her. The music swells and... GOODNESS. I'm glad I have ears and eyes and life within me to witness spectacles like this.<br /><br />Your Hands Are Cold.<br /><br />I've always loved Darcy as a character, for the same reason I loved Colonel Brandon in Sense and Sensibility. To me he's always been a hero, a great man just waiting for a chance to prove his strength and courage. This is perhaps the most powerful scene of the movie. After a terrible confrontation with the Lady Catherine, Lizzy gets up early in the cold morning and walks out into the hills. Just as the sun is coming up, who appears but Darcy, walking up with his jacket billowing in the wind like a hero's cape, sad, noble, and with depth of emotion to bring you to tears. It's like a hero coming back from a war. As he and Lizzy talk, they draw close together just as the sun is coming up between the two of them. That's what I live for. It's a moment that's so romantic and larger than life that it belongs alongside the greatest from Gone With the Wind and Casablanca. I don't know what else to say.<br /><br />The Film<br /><br />What can I say about the acting of this film? For the first time in ages I forgot I was watching ACTORS and felt like I was watching a story unfold in front of me. I haven't felt this way since I was a kid. I forgot anyone was acting. For the most part, the characters in the film simply WERE. In other words, I smell Academy Awards.<br /><br />Knightley's Elizabeth is sharp, sensitive, sweet, and strong, a fully fleshed out acting job that simply makes us believe she IS the character. Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy is so sincere, so from the heart, that we cannot for one moment doubt his sincerity. He brings new depth to a new interpretation of a classic character. Rosamund Pike's Jane is simply overflowing with sweetness and good nature (and the scene of her leaving to pursue her love in the back of a carriage is feminine beauty personified). Even the so often portrayed as unbearably oily Mr. Collins gets a new spin as played by Tom Hollander. I actually felt SORRY for the guy a few times (trapped as he is in his own ridiculous world and never realizing how absolutely pathetic and silly he seems). Also wonderfully done are the Bennet parents played by Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland. Mrs. Bennet comes across more as a misunderstood sweet parent than a hyper-annoying flibbertigibbet. And Mr. Bennet just has more emotional resonance than in any previous version I've ever seen. Just about everyone is perfectly played in this movie.<br /><br />The music is sparing, but used to great effect. Never overwhelming the action, but rather pushing it, the soundtrack is quite good (I have it). There are moments of supreme beauty to be heard, but on the whole the soundtrack is rather sparse (comes to little more than half an hour).<br /><br />Some reviewers on the Net said that this production was by-the-numbers. I can understand that...if you happen to be color-blind, tone-deaf, and wouldn't know a good script if it smacked you upside the head. This film deserves to sweep the Oscars in every category. So perfect is the camera-work ( I have seen nothing like it since the days of Ford, Cardiff and Kurosawa), the score (heart-breaking), the acting (I love ALL the characters), and the script (it reaches straight into your heart) that EVERYONE should enjoy this film. Like the story that inspired it, it is a perfect marriage of the Male and Female personalities combining the Epic feel and strength of a man's film with the delicacy, beauty, and wit of a woman's film. I had thought long ago that the two great miracles of film-making would be to make the ordinary seem Epic, or the Epic seem ordinary. This film makes the ordinary, the lives and loves of people, into something as Epic as the end of the world or the blazing of new frontiers. I for one shall never be the same. After seeing this film I look at the world in a different way, and perhaps always shall.<br /><br />If this movie has one major flaw it is this: it is FAR too short at 2 hours. This is simply too big a story with too many characters to tell in that short a time. As such a lot of things things had to be spelled-out, and entire scenes and characters got the chopping block. And another reason I wish it were longer: I enjoyed every moment of this film so much I never wanted it to end.  My first words at as the end credits rolled were something like \\"I can't wait for the director's cut.\\" You could wait for it to come out on DVD, but then you'd have to buy a big-screen TV and a surround-sound system to experience it's full glory. And to see this one on pan-and-scan would be to cut it's head off with a guillotine. In short, THIS is the film that EVERYONE has been waiting for.<br /><br />I tried to write a review. I really did. Words failed me. Please see this film in the theater. Please.in fact almost obsessed with him.

B000AY3KN0|5.0|Just a word of clarification -- several reviewers have said that it's back and included as an extra on the DVD.  Not quite.  It's lost -- nothing exists but a few still photos, some pre-production sketches and a short outline in the script.  No one even knows exactly what it contained or how some of the creatures appeared.  But, based on what does exist, Peter Jackson shot a NEW spider sequence using filming techniques from the 30's.  It's well done and entertaining -- it's just NOT the actual missing footage.  Just an educated guess at what it might have been like.  That's why it's not inserted into the film -- it was never part of it.<br /><br />  Great set over-all.  Super extras.  Kong is pretty grainy, but better than any previous release.  And Fay Wray is still beautiful.

B000AL730O|4.0|All too often since the Beatles went their separate ways, Paul McCartney has failed to live up to expectations, the comparisons with Cole Porter; nearly half of his studio albums are, as the Brits like to say, rubbish. From time to time, however, he manages to rise above his penchant for slapdash recording sessions and &#34;silly love songs&#34; and make a good disc. &#34;Chaos and Creation in the Backyard&#34; is not only good, it's one of his best. Twenty-five years ago, the murder of ex-bandmate John Lennon spurred McCartney to new heights in his solo career, and George Harrison's recent death of cancer seems to have motivated him in much the same fashion.  &#34;Chaos&#34; is less upbeat than the typical McCartney record, its overall sound something of a departure for him. In fine voice throughout, he's also a one-man orchestra, playing guitar, drums, flugelhorn, cello, recorder, tubular bells, Moog and, most prominently, piano.  Highlights include &#34;Friends to Go,&#34; which pays homage to Harrison by imitating his style; the jaunty &#34;English Tea&#34;; &#34;A Certain Softness,&#34; a slinky romantic number in which McCartney uncharacteristically refrains from using the word &#34;love&#34;; &#34;Riding to Vanity Fair,&#34; which admonishes an acquaintance: &#34;And I was open to friendship/ But you didn't seem to have any to spare/ While you were riding to vanity fair&#34;; and the final, hidden track, an instrumental. &#34;Vanity Fair&#34; ranks with the pick of his solo work, songs such as &#34;Give Ireland Back to the Irish,&#34; &#34;Mrs. Vandebilt,&#34; &#34;Sally G,&#34; &#34;Rock Show,&#34; &#34;Daytime Nighttime Suffering,&#34; &#34;The Pound Is Sinking,&#34; &#34;Get It,&#34; &#34;Angry,&#34; &#34;This One&#34; and &#34;The World Tonight.&#34;  As good as &#34;Chaos&#34; is, 1982's &#34;Tug of War,&#34; inspired by Lennon and produced by &#34;the fifth Beatle,&#34; George Martin, remains Sir Paul's best album, his one true masterpiece. &#34;Chaos&#34; comes close but is marred by several cuts with vapid lyrics. &#34;Follow Me,&#34; for example, sounds as if it were composed expressly for the Fidelity Investments commercial in which it's featured.  The disc also suffers by comparison with the recent solo release from another rock legend, Stephen Stills, who began his career emulating the Fab Four. On &#34;Man Alive!&#34;, which has been given short shrift by the critics, Stills demonstrates a multi-instrumental virtuosity to rival McCartney's, command of a variety of genres -- rock, blues, jazz, Cajun and Latin music -- and a lyric-writing talent that the former Beatle can't match.

B00005JO1P|2.0|Hollywood has been making biopic (biographical) films since the beginning of films.  At first, the biographies were overly positive.  \\"The Pride of the Yankees\\", \\"The Charles Lindberg Story,\\" even the post WWII movie \\"The Desert Fox\\" focused more on the positive aspects of Erwin Rommel, a German Field Marshal.  Eventually the genre changed to try to provide a deeper understanding of the person.  \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is the classic example; in that movie the viewer was exposed not to just what T.E. Lawrence did, but who he was. <br /> <br />Eventually these biopic films became much more honest, incorporating both the positive and the negative aspects of individuals.  This is fine; I don't want propaganda in biopic films.  It's fascinating to see the darker side of important figures.  It makes them much more real, and yet makes their accomplishments all the more spectacular.  The movie \\"Ray\\" epitomizes this balance. <br /> <br />\\"Ray\\" was one of the best movies of the decade.  The story of Ray Charles put to the silver screen.  Audiences got a healthy dose of music, an incredible performance by Jamie Foxx, and a fair picture of the life of Ray Charles, including the low points and the high points. <br /> <br />\\"Walk the Line\\" should be the same thing as \\"Ray.\\"  It's a biography of a musical figure who had low points in his life.  But in execution, \\"Walk the Line\\" comes no where near the quality of \\"Ray.\\"  Even in the genre of biographies this movie fails to live up to any standard.  Even if it were decided that Walk the Line should not be compared to \\"Ray,\\" it's still my conclusion that this film isn't worth the price of any admission. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix does a good job portraying the enigmatic singer Johnny Cash; Reese Witherspoon shows her abilities playing the part of June Carter.  The movie looks good, each scene has good direction.  But this movie lacks any kind of spirit.  It has an almost flat reception.  In fact, a major part of the story, the romance between June Carter and Johnny Cash, is absent.  There is no chemistry.  It's not a love story at all.  Carter and Cash appear only as close friends. <br /> <br />The film focuses on ten years of Cash's life.  Ten dark years where Cash was ruled by an addiction to amphetamines and other drugs.  Ten years of strife with his first wife.  Ten years of adultery.  The movie hardly does justice to the life of Johnny Cash, it focuses more on the faults of Johnny Cash.  The goal of this movie was to destroy the memory of Johnny Cash.  It did not present a balanced view of the man's life.  It did not tell us of his origins.  There are few epiphanies.  The characters don't grow as people.  Cash is not presented as a deep character.  He's more or less portrayed as an antagonist. <br /> <br />The man who was Johnny Cash is not present in this film.  The film does not portray his recovery from drugs.  In an act of pure \\"Christo-phobia\\" the movie fails to show Johnny Cash answering an alter-call.  The movie was designed to destroy the man.  Cash's humanly faults become the movie, and the movie exaggerates those faults.  After watching \\"Ray\\" I had a better understanding, respect and empathy for Ray Charles. This movie leaves me no such feelings for Johnny Cash.  It fails as a biography, and it fails as a film.  It belongs to the \\"Made for TV\\" movie genre, not the silver screen.  Save your Cash and go elsewhere. <br />
B000929AJQ|4.0|A lot of people have been calling With Teeth different in a bad way.  I'll agree with the first part, but people need to look beyond the musical spectrum that, in itself, is Nine Inch Nails.  Was Pretty Hate Machine any different from Ministry's Effigy, or any Wumpscut album?  Was the Broken EP any different from a synthesized version of the grungy early 90's?  The Fragile was a jazzy record with a little more emphasis on the lighter tones and music of Nine Inch Nails.  Can any Nine Inch Nail record be called entirely original?  No.  Trent Reznor takes music fashion and adds a dark twist that I, and millions of others, enjoy.  The music of With Teeth is in a nu-metalish order with a little of Trent's signature on it.  The synth in All the Love in the World is reflective of his piano stylings, but also highly reminiscent of most rock effigies.  The drum part for You Know What You Are is original, but the music, lyrics, and production is pure derivative.  Please, NIN fans, be a little more accepting and try to see my point of view.  This album is contrast, not crap.
B000B8QEYC|1.0|Look, I like Enya...I really do. I have all of her CDs and play them a lot, but, come on folks, this CD is nothing but lukewarm leftovers. There's not a single \\"classic\\" Enya track. The songs are too slow and too depressing. What, did somebody close to her die during the five years it took to put this way-too-short offering out? I don't want to hear Enya singing about gloom and doom. Sure, some of her other songs are \\"sad\\" but not like this! This album's not varied at all, except for that silly \\"Riverdance\\" ditty in some fictious language created by Roma Ryan. Ms. Ryan's lyrics are often terribly juvenile...does she sleep with a rhyming dictionary next to her bed? All that's missing is moon, spoon and June, not to mention the fact that a lot of lines are grammatically incorrect and some don't even scan correctly when sung, or that there is no such word as \\"amarantine\\"!! Where's that old Enya magic? Is this Enya evolving into the \\"new\\" Enya? And if this is the \\"new\\" Enya, this is a step backward. This one's sub-par, no matter what the \\"real\\" Enya fans say...and, ya know what? If you really are a REAL Enya fan, you know that this one's not great...we were all just starving after half a decade of waiting, looking forward to another masterpiece like \\"Book of Days\\", \\"Only Time\\" or \\"Caribbean Blue\\", and Enya threw us an old soup bone. I hope that Father Christmas leaves a huge lump of coal in Enya's stocking this year in payback for this lump of cold Irish stew.

0385512058|4.0|I found much of this book to be useful but some suggestions I will never use. I got a little turned off by the chapter \\"Getting Close to Power\\". I am not really interested in the actors and politicians that Mr. Ferrazzi knows and his lessons on how to conduct yourself around \\"celebrities.\\" What is more useful to me is the hints he gives on finding a mentor that's closer to home. I actually doubt I will ever attend a dinner party at Rob Reiner's house and I'm not sure I would even accept an invitation if one was offered. <br /> <br />What I did find useful are the keys and goals of networking that he mentions throughout his book. I like Mr. Ferrazzi's definiton of networking - finding ways to make other people more successful. I don't believe everyone understands these days that it is more important to give than to receive. You cannot expect to get any more out of a relationship than you are willing to put in to it. <br /> <br />I've been to plenty of meetings and conferences where there are \\"networking jerks\\". I wish that those jerks would read this book to learn what it is all about. Even if you are not a \\"jerk\\", this book puts the whole networking experience into proper prospective and gives great advice on handling relationships.
B000BPCCZA|4.0|Let's cut to the chase:  SOAD's latest offering, Hypnotize, doesn't measure up to its predecessor, Mezmerize. <br /> <br />Hypnotize, available in CD and DualDisc formats, meshes pretty well musically with Mezmerize, which achieves one of SOAD's primary goals.  There are plenty of high points on this album - they just don't reach the stratospheric heights that songs like \\"Question!\\", \\"Sad Statue,\\" and \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" do.  You'll find, as always, nonsense (\\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\"), ironic criticism of pop culture (\\"Kill Rock 'n' Roll\\"), melodic bridges fused with roaring indictments (\\"Holy Mountains\\"), and much more, as you've come to expect from this group.  <br /> <br />The short of it is, if you loved Mezmerize, you'll find plenty in Hypnotize to love as well.  If you dislike SOAD, don't expect a turnaround from the sometimes raw and vulgar sounds - they have remained true to themselves while continuing to be innovative as always, so sit down, cut yourself a slice of banana terracotta pie, and revel for half an hour in the latest sonic spree of this Armenian-American quartet. <br /> <br />Final note: the enhanced stereo tracks aren't noticeably different on my 7.0 (sub's on order) system, and the documentary is iffy, so unless you have-to-have-to-have-to have it all, I'd recommend saving a few bucks and going with the CD format rather than DualDisc.  But what do I know?
B00005JOHI|4.0|Joe Wright was cast to direct the latest version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Hmmmm. Joe Wright, directed a couple of forgettable movies, followed by 3 mini-series (the little knowns \\"Nature Boy\\" from 2000, \\"Bodily Harm\\" from 2002 and a lavish, and well-made version of the life of Charles 2,\\"Charles II: The Power and the Passion, 2003) for A&E/BBC. What made the powers behind the newest attempt to film Austen for the big screen choose Joe Wright?<br /><br />Well, Joe got it, right, that is, in many ways. He's made a more contemporary telling of this, my favorite of Austen's tales, and he's done it well. In a run time of less than 2.5 hours, his version will be more easier to digest than the two mini-series of this same work (the stand alone BBC version from 1980 with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul and the 1993 A&E/BBC version that most people know the best; with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth). But, as well done as it is, you'll find it wanting vs. either of these fine mini-series, and the film also pales in comparison to the Emma Thompson/Ang Lee run at \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" in 1995.<br /><br />If you are an Austen fan, the amount of characterization that has to be cut from the story to fit it in to a 2.5 hour run time, will simply horrify you. In particular, both Mr. Wickam and Mr. Collins, potential suitors for the Bennett bevy, are given very small amounts of screen time. Catherine de Bourg, the patroness whose money flows all over a variety of characters in the film (Darcy, for one, is her nephew) was played by Judi Dench with a particularly elegant stiff upper lip, but was given little to do.<br /><br />Director Wright has given us marvelous cinematography and beautiful settings (notably Darcy's estate at Pemberley). He has the same passion I do for Austen's work, and tried to keep the themes.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a love story between a young woman in a family stretched with 5 daughters and literally no dowries in 19th century England. In the book, the Bennetts are an upper middle class lot; in this film, in which Wright instilled a sense of real \\"living on the farm\\", they are shabby versions of Austen's intent.<br /><br />Mr. Bennett (Donald Sutherland) is a country gentleman beloved by his daughters and befuddled by the antics of his wife. Said wife's main passion in life is making sure the girls are all married off so that they are not penniless when the parents die. Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn in a comedic performance that is perhaps a little over the top) makes no pretense of her intentions, and they are embraced with different degrees of exhuberance by her daughters. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Jane (Rosamund Pike), the eldest, are a bit embarrassed by their mother's antics and manage to try and ignore her histrionics while building their anxieties over marriage.<br /><br />It is Jane, the loveliest, whose heart is broken by Mr. Bingley from London, and Elizabeth who runs afoul of his dour friend, Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Before the film is finished, the viewer is as surprised as Elizabeth to learn that Mr. Darcy has fallen in love with her, and having been rejected, Darcy sets out to change Elizabeth's first impression and win her heart by helping her family and by showing how much he cares for his own young sister.<br /><br />Keira Knightley was a good choice for Jane, although the lesser known actresses in both the British mini-series were better in the role than she was. Knightley looks the part as Austen described it, and has a quicksilver screen persona that fits Elizabeth well. If there is not the romance, the chemistry that should have grown on screen between Elizabeth and Darcy, it is not for wont of Knightley's efforts to portray it.<br /><br />Instead, in portraying the difficult Darcy, who, after all, is supposed to be wooden, actor Matthew Macfayden (with an impressive list of British television credentials including the MI5 drama, Spooks) was entirely too successful. He is wooden toa painful degree, and has difficulty turning his cold arrogance into foolishness when he first becomes infatuated with Elizabeth. And he's equally not credible as a \\"do gooder\\". The growth of that Austen staple, the love between two people who society has not meant to be together, the growing awareness, the yearning, well, it is missing from this film. It was not missing in the mini-series. Generally speaking, it usually means the director does not know how to capture the essence of love and longing on film, does not know how to invoke it from his characters and bleed it through to the audience. Despite this, I must say, that I did not walk away wishing to see Matthew Macfayden on the big screen again.<br /><br />And thus, we get an interesting movie, with some fine touches, some believable characters, a solid script and beautiful filming, music and costumes. But contrary to the print ads and the trailers, this is not the film of the year, just a pleasing version of an Austen tale that has been done better in the past.<br /><br />Definitely worth a trip to the theater!successful.

B00008G9JN|5.0|Jethro Tull has had many albums in their long career. Most artists who last that long have an album that stands out from the rest.  Aqualung is probably their biggest seller and most popular.  I personally like to listen to Songs from the Wood. When Ian Anderson did this CD he was at the top of his game.  This album contains: Songs from the Wood, Jack in the green, Hunting girl, Ring out solstice bells, Velvet green and my personal favorite, The Whistler, which includes a very lively piccolo.  The flavor of this release is Celtic. Personally I love Celtic music, especially the way Jethro Tull does it. If you like Tull you need to get this one if you don't already have it.
B00005JO1P|5.0|Growing up in South Dakota during the 50s and 60s I was immersed in Country and Western. Never a big fan, however I loved Johnny Cash. Like my father he served in the USAF; Like my father he was never around; Like my father he was self absorbed and drug dependent. Unlike my father, he met and was saved by the love of his life. <br />I admit to being annoyed when June Carter's warbling stole time from The Man I wanted to see and hear. To me it was like prempting The Beatles appearance on Ed Sullivan with Lawrence Welk. And their duets ... well picture Bobby Burgess dancing with John Lennon. <br />For me, Walk The Line was Ray in a string tie with one exception ... Reese Witherspoon. As much as June Carter added color and years to the life of Johnny Cash, Ms. Witherspoon brightens (and in my opinion, saves) the telling of yet another drug-addled performers life story.  <br />I will always be deeply grateful to Ms. Carter for giving Johnny Cash a reason to live and perform. Likewise, audiences (and producers) for Walk The Line owe a debt of gratitude to Reese Witherspoon. <br />Without Ms. Witherspoon, Walk The Line would be a wonderful movie with outstanding performances by the entire cast. With Ms. Witherspoon, its a great movie. <br />Go, Enjoy! <br />
0380973650|5.0|I should start with a few caveats: I first discovered Gaiman when I stumbled upon the delightful Good Omen, and have read everything else by him. I am a big fan of sci fi/fantasy, and finally, I have enough background knowledge in world mythology so I wasn't as lost as some folks are.<br /><br />So its probably no surprise that I loved this book. I loved the premise - that gods come to the country along with the immigrants, and they all find ways to stay alive once their believers die off. I loved the idea of the 'new gods' that we now worship fighting for the soul of America with the old ones. And I love the stories of the people who came to American. The chapter Coming To America 1798 was incredibly powerful. By the middle, I knew I was reading his masterpiece. What a splendid piece of work.<br /><br />That being said - I do agree with some reviewers that the ending fell apart. I would have ended it mayb 50 or 100 pages earlier. But that didn't stop me from enjoying this book. Its easily one of the top ten books I've read this year

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna may argueably be the single greatest, most consistant pop singer/performer in history.  She's always been able to package her image and sound with a subtle brilliance that no other pop star has matched since the Beatles.  By surronding herself with the best producers and management available, Madonna has carved her place in pop music history as the greatest and one of most influential stars ever.    Her latest collection of songs is a clever mix of electronica and pop with a lounge vibe. Each song flows seamless in transition and paints a urbaneque mural of starlights and neon glow.  Once again, her album builds upon strong production and song craftsmanship that caters to Madonna simplistically effective vocal delivery.  The album is orchestrated with a minmalistic approach which plays most strongly to Madonna's ability.    This is a solid album for Madonna fans as well as electronica and pop fans alike. Some of the material has a rehashed sort of appeal to it but its understated overall tone makes this a well-crafted pop commercial effort on all levels.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Her new Album is amazing. Danceable, singable, energetic. Her re-invention image is appealing, fun, and again, sets the trend once again. Of course, this is Madonna, the ONE who invents the trends of past, present and future.

B0000025DT|5.0|From the Electric Light Orchestra's inception from the ashes of the Move in 1970, bandleader Jeff Lynne's aim was to continue on the trail the Beatles had blazed, crafting pristine melodic pop against a backdrop of classical grandiloquence. Lofty ambitions, even for a talent of Mr. Lynne's magnitude. But on 1976's A New World Record ELO got as close as anybody ever has to picking up where the Fab Four left off - and that's the highest praise you can give them.    On this, their sixth LP, ELO refined the increasingly commercial sound of Eldorado (1974) and Face the Music (1975) into a polished, super-accessible hit machine. Their recipe for success went something like this: A) Create an exciting, instantly memorable melody that would do the likes of Paul McCartney himself proud. B) Put lyrics to it and perform with bassist Kelly Groucutt's and drummer Bev Bevan's solid foundation, keyboardist Richard Tandy's spacey synthesizers, and Jeff Lynne's fluid guitar work and spine-tingling falsetto. C) Frost it with coat upon lustrous coat of fluttery vocal harmonies, overdubbed guitars and synths, and bombastic orchestral flourishes. D) Bake for 1 hour at 400 F, let cool for 10 minutes, and enjoy.      This ingenious formula forms the groundwork upon which A New World Record is constructed. Not surprisingly, it produced three huge singles - the adrenaline-charged Do Ya, dynamic Livin' Thing, and crushingly bittersweet Telephone Line - but every last cut here could've been a hit. Don't be fooled into believing this stuff is formulaic or uninspired, however. Jeff Lynne, who wrote and arranged it all, is as imaginative as he is ambitious. His most impressive achievement is the fact that, despite its prominence, he doesn't allow the orchestra to overwhelm the songs. Rather, true to his aspirations, he turns it into an absolutely integral part of the whole. In doing so he makes Rockaria's overwrought blues-meets-opera sound almost effortless, lends the quasi-symphonic pretensions of Tightrope a sense of authenticity, and elevates the stunning closer Shangri-La to positively epic proportions, not to mention the rest. Quite an accomplishment, made all the more astonishing by the fact it could've gone so wrong.    Granted, A New World Record was a product of its time - feathery falsettos; quasi-prog showboating; string-laden (what some might call) overproduction; and an irresistable, state-of-the-70s commercial aesthetic. But if it's to be taken as any indication, them's was the best of times...
B000BO0LLS|5.0|For the last 15 years all it took was one high note to recognize the undeniable voice of the biggest selling female artist of the 90's, Mariah Carey.  Critics and fans alike, though amazed by Carey's vocal range were missing the belting soul driven shy girl that sang songs such as \\"Vision of Love\\" and performed full power on MTV's Unplugged series.  Earlier this year radio was treated to a delightful surprise, the Mariah Carey that we have come to expect had evolved and started off her first single with a confident party starter, \\"It's Like That\\" instead of the light vocals and ode to a guy she cannot have, Carey declared it's her night and she'd have it no other way.  It's more like her year, 2005 has been great to Carey, with the release of \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" earlier in April she delighted music fans by using her incredible vocal range once again, experimenting with different producers (Kanye West, Jim Wright, Jermaine Dupri, Neptunes)to give her a trademark sound with a bit of Mariah that not even her fans were used to.  The album has gone on to sell 4 million copies in the States alone and has produced her biggest record to date, \\"We Belong Together\\" along with Radio hits \\"Shake It Off\\" and the current \\"Don't Forget About Us.\\"  The latter is off the recently re-issued package known as the \\"Ultra Platinum Edition.\\"  The cd comes with new artwork and 3 new tracks, including the remix to \\"We Belong Together\\" featuring Jadakiss and Styles P.  \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" is not much of a departure from \\"We Belong Together\\" and its signature style, but radio isn't complaining, it has a confidence in vocals and track and the video is just as provacative, if not more.  The second recording with Twista is known as \\"So Lonely (One & Only Pt. II)\\" and is a different take than the one found on Twista's album, as this one features Carey starting off the track with her own rhymes.  The track, produced by Darkchild, has monster hit written all over its smooth, bass driven,seductive chorus and playful words.  Mariah teamed up with J.D. once again for the new track, \\"Makin' It Last All Nite (What It Do)\\" and she sings Shai's lyrics in a teasing tone with Jermaine making a guest appearance on the track.  The album flows from start to finish, picks up with party tracks, uptempo tracks that get the younger and older audiences ready for their own nights, but brings us back to why we fell in love with \\"THE VOICE\\" to begin with on tracks your average singer would dare not tackle, such as the Glady's Knight styled \\"Circles\\", one of the best tracks on the album, with a full belting Carey singing \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Your Girl\\", \\"I Wish You Knew\\" and the powerful \\"Mine Again.\\"  With the repackaging, the once almost flawless album steps into a realm of perfection that artists only dream of having.   <br /> <br />Keep an eye out for the limited CD/DVD combo, as the interview \\"Mariah In Her Own Words\\" is worth buying the album all on its own, with hilarious outtakes and \\"diva behind the scenes\\" moments along with all 5 videos. (\\"Get Your Number\\" only released overseas, \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" available with WebLink) <br /> <br />
B00005JNQS|3.0|When you throw together a decent plot formula, high quality slick animation, Blue Man Group on music, a fine stable of voice actors, and, well, probably tons of funds, I'd expect to see a very entertaining movie. And while Robots is certainly entertaining, it never ratchets itself up into the land of four stars. <br /> <br />The natural comparison is Monsters, Inc., which I still pull out every so often (more often now that I have an 18 month old daughter). Sections of Robots are filled with the same sorts of allusions that generate an chuckle at the cleverness of the creators. That cleverness, however, overloads the movie, and feels too intentional (\\"Wouldn't it be clever if we...\\"), instead of giving additional levels of amusement. <br /> <br />The cast of characters is, also, I think a bit too large for total enjoyment on a first viewing, as I was too busy trying to keep track of people, not knowing how significant they were going to be. <br /> <br />And all that, the cleverness and the number of characters, and the clear amount of thought and energy that went into this makes me think I'm going to watch it again, and probably even enjoy it more the second time around. <br /> <br />Maybe I should have given it four stars after all.
B000BC8TBE|1.0|Don't tell me Mariah re-released her Christmas album as a dual disc now!? God, she's only just released the fourth edition of The Emancipation Of Mimi! She should quit it already. Stick with the original albums to teach her a lesson!
B000AARKOO|3.0|The only thing I really understood about the movie is that it is a fight for Jerusalem other than that I didn't really follow. The movie is shot very well and looks great. If you like watching visual movies instead of following dialog, I suggest Kingdom of Heaven.
B0007GAERG|1.0|These songs are average, but I gave it one star because she's such a cash-in. You can't tell me she's not. You can't tell me that when she travelled 11 places from #15 to #4 this week on the Billboard and when she went 13 places from #47 to #34 in the UK because of the Platinum edition, that she wouldn't have laughed and not said: \\"Haha, you fools. I honestly only released this fourth edition of the album for your money.\\" Pathetic.
B0006L16N8|1.0|My Lord, if this is all my generation of music has to offer in terms of the biggest band being Coldplay and Chris Martin being an icon... oh dear, i'm gonna have to tell some pretty big lies to my grandkids when they ask me what music was like when i was younger... this is soooo boring, unadventurous, and absolute PAP! <br /> <br />Lyrics like 'Tears streaming down your face... i'll try to fix you' oh please! 'birds flying at the speed of sound... if you could see it then you'd understand' erm, what? <br /> <br />For heaven's sake! Look at decent bands for decent music like Arctic Monkeys, the Killers, Kasabian... not Chris Martin's dreary old granny music that is about as interesting as a Walnut Whip. <br /> <br />I was completely ripped off when i bought this CD. Liam Galleger is right, Chris Martin is a plant pot. <br /> <br />Choose your icons carefully!
B000002A46|4.0|This is a good Christmas album. Just don't buy the dual disc release and teach Mariah a lesson. Then she'll stop re-releasing old albums of hers! Other than that, there's a few good tracks, keepers, and songs worth listening to!
B000BKJ78K|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who said that maybe this will be an opportunity for people who couldn't get last year's set to buy the trilogy on DVD.  Most of the people who complain about it are the ones who are first in line to buy everything Star Wars.   <br />         By the way, don't say that the changes that were made were unannounced.  If you looked at several websites the changes were described in full.   <br />         As the title of my review says If you don't like it don't buy it.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Let's get this thing straight, right. Madonna has sold more records than Mariah. (Like other reviewers have said, just check in the Guiness Book Of Hit Singles And Albums.) Face it, Mariah's fans and lambs, but there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. You can say it's not true, but that's just a lie. A big fat lie. Now, with that over, let's get on to the album itself. <br /> <br />Madonna's first single from the album, Hung Up, debuted at #20 on the Hot 100 - the highest non-American Idol female debut of the year. It seemed doomed when it then fell (21-27), but then seemed back in business in its fourth week when climbing to #14. In its fifth week, it's only climbed higher, to #7, beating off competition from her rival - Don't Forget About Us so far has only made #11. Hung Up also gives Madonna her highest-charting single since Don't Tell Me hit #4. Confessions On A Dance Floor hit #1 on the Billboard's album chart, and it did in twenty-four other countries, including the UK. (Hung Up is also currently spending its second week at #1 there.) As if that wasn't enough, Confessions sold 3.6 million worldwide in its first week of release. (Check on Wikipedia.) Beat that, Mariah, as another reviewer said!  <br /> <br />1 - Hung Up - 5/5 <br />2 - Get Together - 5/5 <br />3 - Sorry - 5/5 <br />4 - Future Lovers - 5/5 <br />5 - I Love New York - 4/5 <br />6 - Let It Will Be - 5/5 <br />7 - Forbidden Love - 5/5 <br />8 - Jump - 5/5 <br />9 - How High - 5/5 <br />10 - Isaac - 5/5 <br />11 - Push - 5/5 <br />12 - Like It Or Not - 5/5 <br /> <br />Top five (in no particular order): Sorry, Let It Will Be, Forbidden Love, Isaac, Like It Or Not. (But Hung Up is FANTASTIC too!)
B00082IJ08|5.0|the gorillaz have always been one of my favourite bands of all time...and they are fictious characters.  they are better than most of the bands that came out in the past 6 years.  i loved their last piece of work but i am definatley feelin the latest DEMON DAYZ... what i love about them, they have possibly the most depressing lyrics ever but makes sure that you can dance to the song. they dont have a specific genre.  the gorillaz are all over the place with hip hop, rock, techno, electronica, alternative, etc. <br /> <br />honestly, who does not like the breakout hit 'feel good inc.\\" w/ de la soul. this song is a must in all ipods and car stereos.  i love this song to DEATH.  i love the way de la soul comes out of nowhere and makes the song sound hip hop. <br /> <br />'dare' is another favourite of mine.  the video clip is jsut amazing. noodle (the girl singing the song) did her thang!!! <br /> <br />'dirty harry', 'kids with guns', 'o green world', 'november has come', and 'demon days' are sum of my favourite tracks. but i rarely skip tracks on this LP. since the first day it came out in may i probably listen to this cd more than any other LP that came out this year. <br /> <br />the gorillaz are geniuses and they kno it. they are a force to be reckon with. GORILLAZ R ON THE RISE TO BE THE GREATEST.... <br /> <br />
0312995423|2.0|When you read Dan Brown books you have to ask yourself a few questions:  How many super-geniuses can there be in the world who also happen to look like super models and swimmers?  And how many of these people are single?  And how come the keep bumping into one another?<br /><br />Brown's books, despite what he may think, are not literature.  They are the type of page-turners that are great for killing time in an airport.  If that's what you're looking for, I fully endorse Brown--although I'd start with \\"Angels and Demons,\\" which is his best novel to date.  But if you're looking for a plot that makes sense, you need to look else where.  If you get annoyed by over-the-top twists, characters who are little more than pretty/brilliant, and friends who are actually enemies.<br /><br />For those interested in the plot:  this this a techno-thriller that involves a super-brilliant, gorgeous woman who breaks codes for the US government and her equally gorgeous fiance, a college professor that gets pulled into her work when they two of them team up to stop an unknown enemy who's intent on destroying the world's greatest spy-computer.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|In this movie there is a lot of things that are out of the ordinary but in that sense they bring a fictional story by a author to life on the big screen. Also the director choose a very excellent actor to act Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp acts the part with skills that takes a lot of intelligents and a sense of feeling that he must show to make this character come to life. The director Tim Burton is amazing with all his ways he makes  movies because he always makes then different, so instead of what you might expect, you seem to get the opposite when your watching one. I would recommend this movie for all ages. It is a funny and joyous movie that would brighten up the saddest day.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|a film with something for everyone.  the creators mentioned that they were trying to create the perfect \\"date movie,\\" and i think they've pretty much succeeded. there's blood and gore for the boys, a bit of romance for the ladies, and deadpan british humour that can be enjoyed by both sexes. it's nice to see a horror film that features a regular person leading a regular life rather than some blond, glamourous hunk or a group of privleged teens. pegg is delightfully dumpy as shaun, and there is excellent on-screen chemistry between pegg and frost (who plays slacker roommate ed).<br /><br />while the film is intended to be equal parts horror and romantic comedy, i doubt that it will keep you awake at night. there is considerable bloodshed, particularly in a scene where irritating irish git david is pulled out a window by marauding zombies and eaten alive (mercifully, the film's creators don't allow us to see david's ressurrected corpse trailing entrails all over the place). i thought one of the most intriguing bits was at the very beginning, in which the viewer watches various individuals whose lives are caught up in dreary, mundane routines whose movements and demeanor are already zombie-like. the filmmakers refuse to provide an ultimate explanation for the plague of flesh-eating undead, thus reinforcing the message that modern life makes zombies of us all. the film's conclusion offers a humourous twist, as the survivors of \\"z-day\\" come up with a unique solution for dealing with the hideous undead that still walk among them.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I don't have enough good things to say about Enya's work.  She is my favorite single music artist of all time.  Her songs exude an audible beauty that touches the soul.  I find her music transcendent.  In addition, Enya's albums contain tracks whose lyrical style changes.  Most of her songs are soothing, captivating melodies, but Enya shakes things up every so often with a hard, moody piece thrown in.  It keeps things from getting stale, if there was ever such a risk.<br /><br />Amarantine continues Enya's well-deserved reputation for perfection in music.  Every track on here is something special, but some really stand out to me.  'Less than a pearl' is enchanting.  'The river sings' manages to be both light and heavy while making you want to riverdance.  'Long long journey' just plain makes you feel good.  'Someone said goodbye' is pleasantly catchy.  'Drifting' makes me cry because it evokes sad images in my imagination.<br /><br />If there was ONE thing to complain about, and this is minor, it's that the tracks are all fairly short.  This is common in Enya's music.  Four minutes is long for an Enya song.  Look at it this way though, if the music were BAD, then no one would be craving more of it!<br /><br />There's a reason Enya's work is used in movies and commercials, and why so many people love it.  Buy this album and find out why for yourself.
B000065PUE|3.0|while i love the pixies, i'm not about to claim that they can do no wrong. personally, i object to the more accessible nature of this album and would urge all prospective pixies fans to purchase \\"surfer rosa\\" first. while some of \\"surfer's\\" discordant and abrasive punk spirit remains intact on \\"doolittle,\\" in tracks like \\"hey\\", \\"gouge away\\", and \\"dead\\", the album also features melodic pop ballads like \\"la la love you\\" and the mildly countrified \\"silver\\" which make me wince. the twisted passion of \\"surfer rosa\\" is lacking here, not to mention the humour.<br /><br />nonetheless, the intricate interplay of black and deal's vocals is still breath-taking. the good parts of this album are far, far better than the crap that masquerades as indie these days. and one has to like the opening track \\"debaser,\\" as it heavily references the surreal cinema piece, \\"un chien andalou.\\" but there are weak parts, as well, and you can expect to be skipping around the tracks upon each listening.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Despite the success of Bad, it was hard not to view it as a bit of a letdown, since it presented a cleaner, colder, calculated version of Thriller -- something that delivered what it should on the surface, but wound up offering less in the long run. So, it was time for a change-up, something even a superstar as huge as Michael Jackson realized, so he left Quincy Jones behind, hired Guy mastermind Teddy Riley as the main producer, and worked with a variety of other producers, arrangers, and writers, most notably Bruce Swedien and Bill Bottrell. The end result of this is a much sharper, harder, riskier album than Bad, one that has its eyes on the street, even if its heart gets middle-class soft on \\"Heal the World.\\" The shift in direction and change of collaborators has liberated Jackson, and he's written a set of songs that is considerably stronger than Bad, often approaching the consistency of Off the Wall and Thriller. If it is hardly as effervescent or joyous as either of those records, chalk it up to his suffocating stardom, which results in a set of songs without much real emotional center, either in their substance or performance. But, there's a lot to be said for professional craftsmanship at its peak, and Dangerous has plenty of that, not just on such fine singles as \\"In the Closet,\\" \\"Remember the Time,\\" or the blistering \\"Jam,\\" but on album tracks like \\"Why You Wanna Trip on Me.\\" No, it's not perfect -- it has a terrible cover, a couple of slow spots, and suffers from CD-era ailments of the early '90s, such as its overly long running time and its deadening Q Sound production, which sounds like somebody forgot to take the Surround Sound button off. Even so, Dangerous captures Jackson at a near-peak, delivering an album that would have ruled the pop charts surely and smoothly if it had arrived just a year earlier. But it didn't -- it arrived along with grunge, which changed the rules of the game nearly as much as Thriller itself. Consequently, it's the rare multi-platinum, number one album that qualifies as a nearly forgotten, underappreciated record. [In 2001, a remastered edition was released with a detailed booklet]
B000AYQLX6|5.0|Most critics seem to agree that \\"Walls and Bridges\\" is Lennon's second weakest album, right after \\"Sometime In New York City.\\" It's been criticized as being unfocused and having filler. Although most critics will grant that the album does have some redeeming qualities and a few good songs. I strongly disagree with what most critics say about this album. In my opinion, \\"Wall and Bridges\\" stands alongside \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" and \\"Imagine\\" as being some of the best music Lennon ever recorded. I would even put \\"Walls and Bridges\\" right alongside Led Zeppelin's \\"Zoso\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" as one of the best albums of the 1970s.<br /><br />John Lennon's music has often been autobiographical. This album shows that as much as any other album he recorded. At the time, Lennon was a man in pain. He was separated from Yoko and unsure of what to do or where he wanted to go. He indulged in drinking and heavy partying in the infamous \\"Lost Weekend.\\" This album is not a catharsis of raw emotion like \\"The Plastic Ono Band.\\" This album is more like a diary from a dark period in a mans life. It's not so much a cry for help, but more of an album of resignation and defeat.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Down On Love\\" a mid-tempo song about falling to pieces. In his delivery, Lennon sounds as though he is pleading for help, but he also sounds dejected. \\"Whatever Get You Through the Night\\" is one of Lennon's biggest solo hits. A great catchy duet with Elton John. \\"Old Dirt Road\\" is a beautiful balled about being lost. \\"What you Got\\" is not one of the album's strongest tracks. It's just a sort of sloppy rocker, but it adds to the album's overall charm. \\"Bless You\\" another beautiful balled in the vein of \\"Imagine.\\" \\"Scared\\" is a cool mid-tempo song whose meaning is self-explanatory. But in his singing, the song sounds as though Lennon really is scared--it sounds lived in. When he's yelling that he's scared, you can feel the mans torment. \\"Scared\\" runs perfectly into \\"#-9 Dream\\" a lush, pop-savvy mid-tempo rocker with cool cellos. \\"Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradise)\\" is another filler song--not great, not bad--just filler. The album would have been slightly better without its inclusion. \\"Steel and Glass\\" is the follow-up to \\"How Do You Sleep at Night.\\" The contrast of it's raw, angry delivery with the lush music sounds great and enhances the song. \\"Beef Jerky\\" is a cool jam instrumental. \\"Nobody Loves You (When Your Down and Out)\\" is a depressing song about looking at life straight in the eye when you are lonely and dejected. \\"Ya Ya\\" is a filler sound byte, with Lennon's son, Julian on drums. It's a cool way to end the album.<br /><br />The original CD pressing sounded a bit stuffy. The new remastered edition is a big improvement.sh, pop-savvy mid-tempo rocker with cool cellos. \\"Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradise)\\" is another filler song--not great, not bad--just filler.

B000AGTPUK|5.0|Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis, the same team who brought us such great movies as \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"Cast Away\\", have teamed up again, and they deliver perhaps their best movie ever in this classic adaptation of the popular children's book. <br /> <br />On Christmas Eve, a massive steam train suddenly appears in front of a boy's home.  The conductor, one of Hanks' many roles in the film, jumps off and asks if the boy is getting on.  The boy asks where the train is going.  \\"To the North Pole!\\" is the conductor's reply.  After thinking it over, the boy gets on the train and he, along with several other children are soon on their way to the North Pole to see Santa.  We are introduced to some other children along the way; a young African-American girl, a Know-It-All boy, and a shy boy.  During the course of the film, all of them become very good friends.   <br /> <br />As the train makes its way north, the viewer is treated to many breathtaking special effects.  The scenes where the train is going up and down the mountain passes and sliding over the frozen lake are true high points of the film.  I've never seen special effects this eye-popping before in an animated film.  They are simply superb.  Upon reaching the North Pole, the children are informed that one of them will receive the first gift of Christmas.  However, before this can happen, the children must overcome having their car come uncoupled from the rest of the train, and sliding down a long slide and ending up in Santa's bag.  Who will Santa choose to recieve the first Christmas gift? <br /> <br />Having three small children, I've seen my share of animated children's films in the last few years, but none of those even come close to this tremendous film.  The story is very touching, and the visual effects are out of this world.  I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan and I watch his movies every chance I get.  His roles in this movie are some of his very best, but his role as the wise and caring conductor is perhaps his best.  Needless to say, I give this movie my highest recommendation.  As long as you can still hear the sleighbell jingle, then you'll always be a true believer.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A Winner!  Excellent.  Exceeded my expectations.  A beautiful adaptation and wonderful dramatization. Artfully performed. Has the tension, romance, and history of the period.  Reminiscent of Pride and Prejudice: the fireworks between Margaret Hale and John Thornton is parallel to Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. Richard Armitage, who plays John Thornton, is as handsome and skilled as Colin Firth, who plays Mr. Darcy.  And, Daniela Denby-Ashe, who plays Margaret Hale, possesses the fiesty and strong personality as well as natural beauty to provide the romantic tension so wonderfully felt between the character of Thornton and Hale.  She is the \\"Elizabeth Bennett\\" of North and South. <br /> <br />The music is wonderful.  Bottom line,  a visual and dramatic treat!! <br />  <br />It is the best period piece since Pride and Prejudice! <br />
B00008YJH5|5.0|What little i can remember of the late 80's was discovering that there was more and better music than what i could find on the radio.   <br /> <br />This was one of those albums from that period of time that managed to stay on my mind (wherever that was... heh) even through all of my various exercises in high-velocity, high-impact nihilism. <br /> <br />That i still love it in my sobriety is a testament to both the album and The Pixies.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I shall be pretty brief with my review. <br /> <br />This album is good for dancing as the album states, and has such an irreverent sense of fun about this record. Madonna has definitely loosened up for the production of this record. Fun and catchy, this is what dance beats should be all about! <br /> <br />This is a good album!
B00006BTCA|3.0|Starts off well, the first 5 tracks are all very good but the album really drags from there on with little distinction between each song. Many of the songs suffer from being overly long and in turn sound unfinished. It seems the band was a little too preoccupied with creating atmosphere rather than memorable songs on their debut album. However there is still promise here. Interpol shows that when they get it right they are wonderful (PDA, NYC).
B00005JNBQ|1.0|1 star beeing the minimum this is what it gets, I can't remember having seen anything so stupid, this movie can at best get you smile or laugh out of despair, that's it. <br />Not advisable for people with IQ over the room temperature.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Damian's album is awesome! He reminds me so much of his father, the late and great Bob. Damian's voice is so revealing, so much like his father's, his music not only draws you to listen with your ears, but to listen with your soul.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I've told people before...I think that System of A Down is the single most important band on the planet. Not necessarily the best...but they are extremely smart songwriters...excellent musicians...they have something to say...and some how, they have tapped into an extremely deep audience that seems to trancend metal...they do not compromise what they do, and yet they get more popular by the minute. <br />Now, as most of you know, Hypnotize is the second half of the Mesmerize/Hypnotize project. Mesmerize was a brilliant collection of songs...and this one carries on that trend. The album is faster and heavier as a whole, but the band still displays their mellow side as well. he highlight for me was the last track, \\"Soldier Side\\", who's intro is the lead track on Mesmerize, but this song is the most dynamic, emotional, and fine-tuned song on the album.  <br />The band just seems to get better and better every time that they put something out...I really can't wait to see what is in store for them in the future. Keep your eyes on these guys. Also, a side-note...the packaging of the two albums actually fit together to form one big album display with continuing art and everything...very cool.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|\\"Wicked\\" suffers from being tugged every \\"witch\\" way by its great shortcomings and stellar successes. Though \\"suffer\\" is hardly an appropriate verb since \\"Wicked\\" has spent the past two years as the hottest ticket on Broadway and, I admit, deservingly so.    Winnie Holzman's book is smart and tender, and absolutely robbed of the Tony.  One wishes more were preserved on this disc.  Stephen Schwartz' score is absolutely scintillating, albeit in a way that relies heavily on \\"money notes\\" and orchestrations that captivate you by force.  For what it cares to achieve, it does well. The lyrics aren't as sophisticated as Holzman's book, but they suffice.     Stars Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth both give Tony-demanding turns here (it's a shame they had to compete, not only with each other, but with Tonya Pinkins and Donna Murphy - all of whom deserved trophies).  Menzel claims her Tony loud and clear with her giddily hopeful \\"The Wizard and I\\" and, of course, \\"Defying Gravity\\" - the now-anthem of every fourteen year-old girl in the country.  She even manages to make the most of the dull \\"I'm Not That Girl\\".  Chenoweth's crystalline opera-trained voice shines in \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" and she's a scream in her diva solo, \\"Popular\\".  Her voice mixes well with Menzel's in the 11 o'clock \\"For Good\\".  It's shame she gets saddled with such embarrassingly obvious lyrics in \\"Thank Goodness\\".      Co-star Norbert Leo Butz sings well enough here, though ill-suited for the role. Carole Shelley is all-but-absent here on disc and THAT is a crying shame. Joel Grey is in fine form, though criminally underused.      Still, \\"Wicked\\" is something special. In a time when Broadway is largely unimaginative garbarge, the sheer joy and magic of this musical make up for any technical shortcomings it may have. Is \\"Wicked\\" the greatest score to grace Broadway?  No. Do we care? No.
0307155102|4.0|If you grew up with this book you might notice a few changes, so be warned.  All references to Native Americans have been removed, as well as soldiers and other subtle things to make the book much more politically correct.  I'm not sure if the changes were made by the illustrator himself before his death, or at least were authorised by him ... if not, it would be a travesty. <br /> <br />However, it's still a wonderful book which all kids should have in their fledgling libraries.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have been a Madonna fan for over 20 years but even I was a little lost after American Life. I respected the fact that she wanted to explore artistically but I longed for the old Madonna where she transported me to a fantasy world on the dance floor. I have been hearing friends around me saying how they they can't wait to buy this album and how they love Madonna again. This is something I haven't heard for awhile. Confessions is her comeback to the dancefloor and I for one welcome her back with open arms!!  <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I Love this Album. The first three tracks, 'Hung Up', 'Get Together', and 'Sorry', blend together so well, and the beats and baseline sound so great! A lot of the rest of the songs are also very good. 'I Love New York' is sorda cheesy, but it is also catchy. Other than 'I Love New York' the rest of this album, including the lyrics, are very creative, inspirational, and thoughtful. You can tell that when Madonna sings the lyrics, they mean a lot to her! This album is very inspirational and should be purchased by all Pop/Dance/Madonna fans all over the world!

B000BM6AVA|3.0|First of all, Daron is a good vocalist.  There are many here that don't appreciate his voice on this CD.  I'm with you on that, but that's because it just doesn't compliment it well.  I remember watching Live at Lowlands, when Daron sung that Pink Floyd cover, and his vocals were great.  Also, a lot of his vocals on Mezmerize were just wonderful.  However, when it came for him to lead in this CD, something changed, it just didn't sound good together.  Instead of enjoying his voice like you may've before, you wonder, 'What is that that's makign this so unenjoyable?\\" <br /> <br />With that said, this new album is a very definite shove in a new direction, even from Mezermize.  Most of the songs are slower and more melodic, however there's still hints of disarray in songs lik Attack.  The one thing that probably bothered me the bost about this CD, was the song structure remained the same for most of the songs, and they were very uneventful at that.  Perhaps I was left feeling bored because my focus is usually on the music (as opposed to lyrics), but on too many of the tracks on the new album I found myself just waiting for the next. <br /> <br />The vocal work itself worked out very well for both Daron and Serj, but there was just something that made a lot of Daron's work on this album stick out like a sore thumb.   <br /> <br />I'm only giving this album a 3 out of 5 simply because I feel SOAD can do better.  Nearly ever album up until Mezmerize captivated me the very first time I listened to it, but since then I find myself having to listen twice or thrice to find something I like about the newer material.  To put it simply, they need to refine and perfect this new sound.  I appreciate that they're pushing in a new direction, but at the moment it is just not perfect.
B000000XB9|5.0|Far form being a hard rock band, CCR is as thrilling as rock n' roll can be.<br /><br />It's fantastic to see how they projected them selves and made hit after hit(altlhough they never had a # 1, instead, 5 # 2 hits)during 1968-1971. They captured what most of the youngster were feeling and thinking about at that time.<br /><br />It's simply irresistible the sound of John Fogerty guitar smooth, while he moans his throat out such classics as Fortunate son, Up around the band (great guitar intro), Suzie Q,<br /><br />Proud Mary, Green river, Down on the corner, Sweet hitch hiker, Hey tonight, and so on... everything here is great, that's why i forsake the one who made the compilation for leaving Born on the Bayou, It's just a thought and Midnight special.<br /><br />CCR never had the intention to be \\"rockstars\\", but they will always be cool. Pure and honest rock n' roll bouncing.<br /><br />Put on your snake trousers and let it rolling down the river...
B0002IU988|5.0|I liked Creed when they were together. Stapp kinda whined on some of their songs. When they broke up, I figured they just were taking a break. I saw an ad for Alter Bridge, and saw the guys from Creed. I was in shock. I got on a checked and sure enough, I read about the break up and everything. This album rocks. Best songs have to be \\"Open Your Eyes\\" \\"Metalingus\\" \\"Find the Real\\" and \\"Down to my Last\\" Buy this album!!!
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna is back and i really like this cd, catchy fun songs, but i just wish that she included some slower songs like her incredible classics Live To Tell and Crazy For You.
0441012906|5.0|My first surprise on reading this novel was that it isn't connected to any of Reynolds' earlier works. I then came to realise that the author has taken some standard SF components and refashioned them into something really really good.  <br /> <br />You have a disaster - \\"the Nanocaust\\" - that has wiped out all life on earth and left the remnants of humanity surviving in various places around the solar system. You have a form of faster than light travel that seems as grittily convincing as anything I've read. Above all, you have a massive structure that rivals Niven's Ringworld , Baxter's Ring and Shaw's Orbitsville for sheer mystery and has something really peculiar inside. <br /> <br />The two main characters are well-drawn and believable. Wendell Floyd is an American jazz musician and private detective who lives in 1950s Paris. Verity Auger is an archaeologist for the United States of Near Earth who is diverted from her exploration of barren, unhabitable Paris on to a mission to a very strange part of the galaxy indeed. They are going to meet up and find themselves solving a mystery , fighting revolting little soldiers , fleeing corrupt French policemen and trying to stop a monstrous crime. <br /> <br />I found the book easy to read - a bit easier than some of Reynolds earlier work. I was afraid the ending would be a bit of an anti-climax - but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />All in all, it's a great book, Go and buy it!
B000B8QF00|5.0|Regarding \\"So Unsexy\\", my Australian copy has it (track 19). It's a live performance. I guess they accidentally put the same cover image onto both versions of the CD.
B0000047CW|5.0|The best intrumental Brazilian album!!!  Charlie Byrd was the 1st to go down to Brazil and add jazz to traditional Brazilian rhythms, and come up with Bossa Nova.  This is the breakthrough album, and it is one of the most romantic, and exciting albums ever recorde in jazz, pop or Brazilian music.  Every song is a delight and every second of thsi album is sheer listening pleasure.  Getz' sax never sounded so lyrical, and Bryd's guitar playing is as gorgeous and jazzy as ever!  Isto  a msica boa de Brazillian dos 1960.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book recently on my vacation away from the rehab clinic where I work.  I was so moved by this honest, reality-based recollection of James' stint in rehab.  It was eye-opening to me to really see a patient's prespective of treatment.  ONE OF MY BEST READS IN A LONG TIME!!!!  Frey has an amazing writing style that conveys to the fullest of all the emotions experienced by the character (which is not so much a character, as it is Frey himself).
B0002EXH4A|4.0|I've bought this album recently, having not heard it in more than 15 years.  I have the original version, not the remix/remaster.  I think this is a great 80s speed metal album, a companion to Peace Sells... Megadeth would release their masterpiece, Rust in Peace, in 1990.  As some have mentioned, the production of So Far, So Good is rather outdated.  Or, rather, Michael Wagener's mix is outdated.  The snare drum on Mary Jane is unbearable; dead center, trebly, reverb madness, shrill.  Painful.  The second half of the record fairs better in that regard.  Regardless of this, if you can get used to the 80s mix, this is very satisfying material.  As my title says, Mustaine made his best music while high.  As far as I'm concerned, after Countdown to Extinction, Megadeth became redundant.  And, by the way, I love their cover here of Anarchy; I'll risk blasphemy and say more than the original!      I don't have any of the remix/remasters.  If they were only remasters (and good ones), I'd have those.  Sure, the remix strips out all of the reverb, but to me it sounds more generic. I listened to these records at the time, and this is how they were.  To me, the reissues are like the Star Wars Special Edition. A bigger problem is the remastering; it's pushed beyond the limits of acceptable volume.  Everything, and I mean everything, is clipped to heck.  Zero dynamic range; just loud and louder, and the sound quality gets distorted.  Terrible.  This is plaguing hard rock/metal recordings and remasters.  No thanks.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|First I'd like to say that even though Daron Malakian isn't the best singer ever, his high pitched voice adds alot to the music on this album. Now, on to rating each track. <br /> <br />1. Attack - 3/5 - This song kind of suprised me when I first popped it into my computer. It seemed different. But once I got to the chorus, it was definatelly remeniscient of the first album. But all in all, it seemed a bit akward. <br /> <br />2. Dreaming - 4/5 - This is a fine song by system. It has alot of technical guitar and they use back up vocals really well. It goes from a fast paced verse to a nice, melodic chorus. It also takes a nice break with some pretty clean guitar riffs. All in all, this is a very well written song, and I found it to be extremely addicting. <br /> <br />3. Kill Rock N Roll - 3.5/5 - I had heard this song in concert when I saw SOAD, and I'd heard a recorded version from a concert about 4 months ago, and the cd version just doesn't do this song justice. They tend to play it a little bit faster in concert, and it sounds amazing. But the cd version has some nice effects w/ the guitar and such. It has some amusing lyrics as well. All in all, it's a fun song to listen to, but if the verses were sped up a bit it'd be just that much better. <br /> <br />4. Hypnotize - 3.5/5 - I've been listening to this song for about 2 weeks before the cd was released, and i have to say it made me pretty impressed, but it just doesn't compare to most of the songs on the album. The lyrics are nice, though, and are a major redeeming factor of the song.  <br /> <br />5. Stealing Society - 4/5 - This is another song of soad's that reminds me of their first album. Some fast guitar, pretty crazy lyrics, and it's a really energetic song. Being a guitarist myself, the guitar in this song is pretty complicated, yet it still flows really well. <br /> <br />6. Tentative - 5/5 - This was my favorite song on the album at first, and it definatelly seemed like one of the songs they'd put more work into. The lyrics are great, and extremely meaningfull. I found myself listening to this song over and over again before listening to the rest of the album, I thought it was that good. After about 2 minutes, the song seems really hypnotic with the melodic, high pitched voacals. Overall, this is one of my favorite songs on the album. <br /> <br />7. U-Fig - 3.5/5 - The title of this song was pretty intriguing, as was the begining. It jumped from slow paced guitar with some cymbals to a loud, fast paced, guitar driven song. Again, the lyrics of this song are outstanding, reflecting current times very well. <br /> <br />8. Holy Mountains - 4/5 - This is another song I heard in concert and I had heard a recorded version from a concert as well, so I was looking foward to the cd version. I was not dissapointed. It is another very hypnotic song, and the backing orchestral instruments along with the voice and guitar effects make for a very haunting song. <br /> <br />9. Vicinity of Obscenity - 5/5 - This was another song that caught my attention. It reminded me alot of the songs sugar and Chic N' Stu. Odd guitar riffs coupled with extremely odd lyrics make for a very interesting song. The Slower part is really amusing as well, a nice change. It was very flowing and sounded nice, besides the lyrics, which were a bit odd. But again, this was a very good track, a definate favorite of diehard SOAD fans. <br /> <br />10. Shes Like Herion - 5.5/5 - This song absolutely blew me away when I first heard it. The lyrics are truthful and packed with feeling. After about a minute thirty seconds, it gets really good. The choruses that follow have added emphasis on them, and it makes for a very powerful song. The end is nice too, when it slows down and Daron slowly says the chorus. Overall an awesome song. <br /> <br />11. Lonely Day - 4.5/5 - This song reminded me of Mr. Jack from Steal This Album. It is a slow, melodic song. After about a minute, Daron plays a guitar riff that is directly in harmony to his voice, and it sounds really good. This song demonstrates Systems matureness, even though it seems kind of corny. The guitar work in the solo and the end chorus are extremely well done. This is another song that I listened to a few times before moving on. <br /> <br />12. Soldier Side - 7/5 - This is BY FAR my favorite song on the entire cd. System saved the best for last. This is one of the most powerful songs I've heard recently, and it's alot better than the crap on the radio now. Touching on the War in Iraq and even religion, this song is amazing on so many levels. The guitar work is probably the best on the album. It's powerful, yet addictive; it tells a story with the lyrics, and it tells it well. I could definatelly see this song being a popular radio release. In my opinion, this is one of System's best works to date, right up there with some of the releases from previous cd's. <br /> <br />Overall on the cd - 4.5/5 - This Cd definatelly shows System's maturity as a band. They touch on all the popular topics of current times, and in a more adult manner than ever before. But don't let that decieve you, SOAD has been one of the bands that has barely changed since their first Cd. This would be a very good cd for the die hard System fans, and it is very much like their first release. The artwork on this album is amazing as well. I've always been a fan of abstract art, and this Cd strikes me as a vrey well thought out cd, and the artwork goes well with the overall theme of the Cd. I HIGHLY recomend this cd to System fan, new and old. You won't be dissapointed.
B00004XQ83|4.0|as many other reviewers have noted, this soundtrack is great, but only gets 4 stars as it is missing the best song in the film, which is the correct film version of \\"I'll Fly Away\\" by the Kossoy Sisters - you can get the missing original song in the film by doing a search on amazon for \\"Best of The Bluegrass Tradition\\" - the box set (a steal at 19.98) it includes their entire 1956 album of angelic songs + 2 more great bluegrass CD's - that song really completes this important soundtrack, Gillian Welch & Alison Krauss do a respectable cover on this soundtrack, but it just cannot hold a candle to the 1956 Kossoy Sisters version used in the film --- little known fact: the Kossoy sisters went to see the film 47 years after they performed the song at age 17 back in 1956, and had no idea it was used in the film! - can you imagine the shock that must have been, hearing a song you did 47 years before and having no idea it was in a film you are watching?
B000000OAN|5.0|This album doesn't grab you the first time you hear it. It didn't grab me. But after I gave it a few listens, I was hooked on it. For once, Queen released an album that had absolutely no filler songs. The real classic here is \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", but hidden treasures are plentiful - \\"The Prophet's Song\\", \\"Death on Two Legs\\", and \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" show that Queen is not just a greatest hits band and that they did release good albums. This album is definetely one of the best of the 70's. This album and Jazz are the two best Queen albums, and no classic rock fan should be without them.
B00007LTIL|5.0|This is the one to get. <br /> <br />And if you want another, then get Workingmans' Dead. <br /> <br />But after that - I would recommend exploring the wide open universe of easily live recordings - the professionally released albums like \\"Without a Net\\" and the \\"Dicks Picks\\" and \\"From the Vault\\" series. If you STILL want more - it's out there for you to find ... around some corner where it's been  waiting to meet you! ;-P*
B000002KON|5.0|Whoa! This is the same band that released VGPS just a year ago, but a different band at the same time. A anti-war concept album, Arthur ranks among the greatest concept albums ever to grace the Earth. And this is not whimsical like VGPS, although it retains some of that quality. This is a rock album, and there's no question about it. The opening number, \\"Victoria\\", takes full advantage of three chords and sets you up for an amazing experience. \\"Yes Sir No Sir\\", \\"Some Mother's Son\\", and \\"Drivin' \\" are all excellent. Then you get \\"Brainwashed\\", a classic Kinks song. The second side starts off with arguably the best song the Kinks did - \\"Shangri-La\\". Ray's writing is perfect, and the the images just pop into your mind as you hear the song. The second side is slighlty weaker than the first...until you get to \\"Arthur\\", the perfect closer. So, this album is excellent...but the real question is \\"Is it better than Tommy?\\". The answer? Who knows. To me, they're even, and to not have either one is a crime. This and VGPS are the Kinks at their finest, and they definitely rank among the greatest rock albums that I've ever heard.
B00002Z88D|3.0|...might've been better. Some of the orchestrations are just cheesemaster and would've been way cooler had say, James Horner (Aliens soundtrack guy) done this.  A few of them are pretty nifty, though.  If someone had asked me to personally produce this, I might've made a single disc with the best cuts, instead of a double cd. <br /> <br />Die hard Metallica fans will dig this in any case; I can see why straight metal fans might diss it, though.
B00005JOHI|5.0|Like most people who love literature I was well aware that Jane Austen could write, but the idea that Keira Knightley can act and hold her own against the likes of Dame Judy Dench was a revelation.  Granted, Knightley has not particularly been called upon to turn in great acting performances in most of her films.  In \\"Love Actually\\" she is basically required to look pretty and her best moments are reaction shots rather than dialogue.  She has many more moments such as that in \\"Pride & Prejudice,\\" but she also proves herself proficient at the witty dialogue.  Knightley filmed this version as her final film as a teenager and the results are comparable to when Franco Zeffirelli cast the teenage Olivia de Hussey in \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\"<br /><br />This becomes the most romantic version of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" because we are not surprised along with Lizzie when Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) shows up and makes the most backhanded proposal of marriage in the history of Western literature.  The screenplay by Deborah Moggach (Emma Thompson receives special thanks in the credits, apparently for script doctoring) makes one significant change in the proceedings by simply having the moment when Darcy falls for Lizzie clearly written on his face.  At the Meryton ball she finds the perfect moment to throw the callous words that she has overheard back into his and with the rapier still skewering her victim she turns on her heels and walks away in triumph.<br /><br />When next he sees her she has walked over to Mr. Bingley's house to care for her sister Jane (Rosamund Pike), who has been taken ill because of the matrimonial machinations of their mother.  Lizzie's hair is down and she is positively glowing.  When we see the look of Darcy's face it is clear that he is beyond smitten, even though through the veneer of upper class manners the signs are decidedly subtle.  From that moment on his affection becomes transparent to us, although Lizzie is surprised to learn of its existence.  Joe Wright also creates a motif where the first time Darcy and Lizzie touch, as he helps her into a carriage, resonates by an emphasis at key moments throughout the film of Darcy's hands.<br /><br />Elizabeth Bennet is the most delightful of the Austen heroines because she has the virtue of not backing down.  Indeed, I believe Darcy first takes real notice of her because she stands up to him at the ball.  When she refuses to back down from Lady Catherine De Bourgh (Judi Dench) at the dinner table it struck me that one of the reasons she is so attractive to Darcy is because she is not trying to be.  Certainly Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blythen) has taught her five daughters it is how to be on their best behavior to catch a husband, and in a world of such propriety her candor is refreshing.  Darcy's curt dismissal of her looks as being tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt him, becomes ironic because for my money it is her brains that make Elizabeth Bennett a real beauty both to him and to us.<br /><br />The screenplay necessitates cutting much of the action to reduce the tale to a two-hour film.  I appreciated being spared the unfortunate incident of Mary at the pianoforte as well as the constructed scene for the final fadeout and my only minor complaint would be that Lady Catherine does not utter her exit line from the novel when she takes her leave of Elizabeth in their final confrontation although I fully understand that the words cannot be uttered under those circumstances and the fact that Lady Catherine shows up immediately on hearing the rumor makes up for being denied the pleasure of hearing Dame Judy declaim that line.<br /><br />I had heard that the Jane Austen Society was less than pleased by Knightley's posture in this film, but one of the strengths of this production is that the Bennetts clearly live in the country.  There are dirt roads that lead to their home, where a large hog wanders through the front door, and when Mr. Darcy and the Bingleys make their first appearances at the local ball the dancing has an exuberance (not to mention slapping of hands) that makes it patently clear that we are far from the hallowed halls of Pemberly or the civilized life of London.  But the outside locations are as sumptuous as the gilded rooms in this film, and cinematographer Roman Osin makes both look gorgeous.<br /><br />For those who consider \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" to be the current cinematic benchmark for Austen adaptations I can report that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is its superior in terms of both romance and comedy by virtue of both crying and laughing more at this 2005 film..  Where Ang Lee's 1995 film comes out ahead is in its depiction of sisterhood, as Jane and Lizzie cannot rival Elinor and Marianne in their bonds of affection, which is understandable since it is more central to that Austen novel.  Even so there is a cute moment of confidences shared beneath the covers and Lizzie's spirited defense of her sister's shyness.  However, this one really is all about Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />I will not be surprised if Knightley receives a Best Actress nomination for her performance here (I still think Joan Allen is the front runner for \\"The Upside of Anger\\").  As is invariably the case with such films the cast of supporting players is superb.  Brenda Blethyn's Mrs. Bennet is the other clear Oscar contender, but Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet has a touching final scene with his daughter, Tom Hollander is toadally obnoxious as Mr. Collins, and my wife really wants to slap Jenna Malone's Lydia a couple of times.  We all know that this is the time of year when most of the films that will be up for Best Picture are released, and \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" has to be in the running because it is simply the best film I have seen this year to date.all the dancing has an exuberance (not to mention slapping of hands) that makes it patently clear that we are far from the hallowed halls of Pemberly or the civilized life of London.

B000B0WODA|4.0|Franz Ferdinand is the type of band that has successfully blended The Kinks and The Doors with the sensibilities of Blondie and The Clash. This is their formula for success, and they continue to do it well on \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\".<br /><br />Just listen to \\"Do You Want To\\" and \\"This Boy\\". Either one could be a hit, and either one could have stepped right off of \\"Parallel Lines\\" by Blondie. Then you have \\"Eleanor But Your Boots On\\" which could have been a Kinks-meets-Marc Bolan glam rock hit. Elswhere, you have typical garagefloor dance jams like \\"I'm Your Villain\\" and punk rockers like \\"You're The Reason I'm Leaving\\" and \\"Well That Was Easy\\". In fact, I disagree with \\"The Fallen\\" being the first single. It doesn't pack the punch of some of the other material here. I personally enjoyed the Gary Numan/early Simple Minds funk of \\"Outsiders\\"--a perfect recapturing of a bygone era in popular music.<br /><br />This Scottish band has found their niche, but the future remains to be seen as to how they will grow and change if they hope to survive. To me, their first and second albums are interchangeable, but also solid works.
0783240287|2.0|I am highly disappointed with this movie. The set, the music, the acting was all magnificent...however, I was appauled and shocked with some of the costumes. There is nothing that is extremely revealing, but extremely suggestive. In the potiphar scene, the women wear these tight skin colored coverings on top with just sparce sequins over their breasts. And from a distance, it looks like they are half naked. I was so embarrassed at my husband seeing that, and no way would I want my kids seeing that. Also, there is a scene at the end where the ladies wear skin tight skin colored full body leotards...that are so skin tight that it looks like they are completely naked...butt crack and all. And they had this dark gold leafy crap over their front private area. So from a distance, it looked like they were completely naked. And over top that they are wearing a chain type dress covering, it was just gross. There were also several other parts that were just disguisting. For a movie that is supposed to be catered to children, I was sorely disappointed.
B000BPCCZA|5.0|Hypnotize is a really good album, heavy riffs, 70's like guitars and fun melodys. <br />And it is good to see that it has been released on the dual disc as well. <br />But is it worth paying another $3?? <br />I think it is. <br />You get the film clips B.Y.O.B. and Question!, but the film/documentary about the making of the album is very bad. <br />And the \\"enhanced stereo\\".  <br />It sounds OK. It's in surround sound. <br />Overall, people that don't like some of the songs that own both albums could just make a burnt cd with whatever they want. <br />
0895260131|5.0|From a person who has been studying Islam for some time, I can attest that the materials used in this book to expose Islam are from the \\"Authentic Islamic Sources.\\" I don't believe that we need a book to write about in revealing the detestable, belligerent nature of Islam. The readers have but to obtain true Islamic texts to come to this conclusion.  <br /> <br />So, my advice to the readers is to verify each and every point discussed in this book, regarding the Islamic precepts, with Orthodox Islamic sources. I challenge you to do so. Believe me, you'll be shocked.  <br /> <br />As for the critics of this book, like the reviewer below, it is \\"sad\\" that they have to resort to censorship by questioning amazon.com for selling this book. None who is critical of this book have successfully been able to refute any of the charges made against Islam by its opponents and detractors. They usually resort to \\"name callings,\\" \\"character assassinations,\\" and \\"downright censorship.\\" Because they cannot defend the indefensible, they resort to burning books (see. Salman Rushdie).  <br /> <br />Rest assured, anti-Islam movement is gaining ground and it is globally. The recent beheadings of Christian girls in Islamic \\"moderate\\" Indonesia, beheadings of Buddhist monks in Islamic Southern Thailand are but the latest additions to the great Legacy of Islamic Jihad. Simply place the following web link - [...] - on your browser and take a good look at \\"The List.\\" There you will see the face of Global Jihad .   <br />
B0001LYH9S|5.0|I think that Outside is almost as good as Station To Station, Ziggy Stardust, Low, etc. Some people will disagree with me because of its gruesome concept that doesn't really go anywhere. Hell, even I was disturbed when I first read the inserts and heard track five, and there's hardly anything that ever shocks me! But, it's just like a scary movie. After you see it/hear it once, you're not really shocked anymore the next next time you see or hear it. I think if Bowie had added some more segues or left the concept out all together, there would be less people bashing this. Some people also say that it's too long, \\"about 80 minutes,\\" and has some filler. Personally, I think \\"Wishful Beginnings\\" is a little weaker than rest, but that's about it. <br /> <br />You're probably wondering why I gave this a five star rating. It's because of the music!!! There is nothing else that really sounds quite like it. Outside has an odd combination of industrial and jazz music, that somehow actually really works. I'm not even a big fan of either industrial or jazz, and I still really like this CD! Brian Eno, \\"Roxy music member, producer of U2's \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" \\"Achtung Baby,\\" etc.\\" is on here and he really adds to this with his synthesizers. Mark Garson also does some really good piano playing. The CD just sounds great and it feels like everyone put a lot of effort into it. Well, maybe not a whole lot of effort into the concept, but definitley the music. Some of the stand out tracks are \\"Outside,\\" \\"The Heart's Filthy Lesson,\\" \\"Hallo Spaceboy,\\" \\"The Motel,\\" \\"The Voyeur Of Utter Destruction,\\" \\"I Am With Name,\\" and \\"Strangers When We Meet.\\" <br /> <br />If you already have the 95' release of this, I wouldn't bother buying it again just for the extra track at the end. It's a pretty decent song, but I'd just download it instead of paying for the whole CD again. Anyway, I highly recommend this along with all of Bowie's 70's work and Scary Monsters.
B000BKJ78U|3.0|O.K. George you are almost there. I am a fan of the original movies, as I am a fan of all original movies without changes. I still only want the ORIGINAL \\"STAR WARS\\". I do like the concept of box sets without the extra discs because how many times are you going to watch the extra features. Those of you who are interested in extra features can buy the other boxed set at the higher price. Me I'm a purist, I just want the film. George you can make millions if you released them individually and in their orginal state, until then you don't get a nickel from me.
B000B7TLSY|5.0|I love this movie and I love my PSP the audio is good and the picture is clear, and well the movie speaks for itself
B0002IU988|5.0|I had this album since it came out and I love it from start to finish. I think this one of the best albums of last year. Miles Kennedy(singer) is one of the best singer out there right know. If you have not hear Alter Bridge you have because is just amazing band.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|You've got to be impressed with the talent of this band!  They write all their own music and the lead vocals are incredible.  I've taken my son to see them perform and had the opportunity to meet and talk with them. Can't wait to see how far they go!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|When I first found out that System Of A Down had decided to release two discs instead of one, I was somewhat disappointed. Now I see why. <br /> <br />There is so much material covered between the two that it would have been too much to release both at once. Hypnotize is probably Systems most political punch yet. The entire album is oozing with pain-staking realities that almost make you want to cry. Dont get me wrong here, because this album is worth every cent you pay for it.  <br /> <br />\\"Where are we supposed to go when the bombs start to fall?\\" This is a direct quote from track six, \\"Tentative\\". This is a prime example of System Of A Down hitting every single listener in the heart.  <br /> <br />Besides being political, the album is packed full of amazing melodies with intricate harmonies and gymnastic vocals. This album has moments that really sound like their old style, proving that they still have their roots. But, as always, the mood changes quickly and new ideas come forward, proving growth. <br /> <br />Personally, I could not ask for anything more. I have been a fan for quite a while, but this album, along with Mezmerize, will attract more listeners. This is a very, very powerful cd. If you dont have it, you should get it.  <br /> <br />Key Tracks (in my opinion): <br />\\"Dreaming\\" <br />\\"Tentative\\" <br />\\"Holy Mountains\\" <br />\\"Soldier Side\\" <br /> <br />**For the best listening experience, listen to the entire album straight. The CD as a whole is very well put together. Make sure you have something to cheer you up after listening to Soldier Side (the last song on the album). <br /> <br />Thank you
B000BM6AVA|5.0|First of all, to the ones who are giving this a low grade, do this: If you just listened to this album once, please listen to if a few more times. To those of you who are reluctant from some of these negative reviews, before purchasing it please borrow it from a friend and give it a few listens. You will know what I mean. I am saying this from experience. The first time I listened to it I said to myself that Mezmorize is the better of the two releases and certainly does not compare to SOAD's earlier work. After giving it a few more listens, I am saying DAMN! this is one of the best albums I have ever listened to. I also am very happy to know SOAD is constantly coming out with good albums and so far they have not sold out to the public. They are doing things their way, just like Metallica used to do before Bob Rock got a hold of them. <br /> <br />Now, here is my review of Hypnotize: <br />I consider this to be every bit as good, or even better than their first two albums. This is saying a lot because their first two albums are fantastic. Each time I listen to it I get to like it more and more. Here are the songs: <br /> <br />Attack - Amazing guitar riffs with fantastic softer passages, which are almost anti climatic of the song itself - 10/10 <br /> <br />Dreaming - This has some of the most beautiful music passages I've heard from SOAD. - 10/10 <br /> <br />Kill Rock 'N Roll - I consider this to be an uneven song but I still like it. Some parts of it are truly amazing - 8/10 <br /> <br />Hypnotize - Beautiful!!! I especially like the last few minutes of it. 12/10 <br /> <br />Stealing Society - Another very good song but I don't like it as much as Hypnotize To me this song sounds very punkish.- 8/10 <br /> <br />Tentative - This is a fantastic song. It never gets boring to listen to It can even serve as backdrop music for an epic movie. It's extremely haunting.- 12/10 <br /> <br />U-Fig - Another good song, but not the greatest on this album - 8/10 <br /> <br />Holy Mountains - Holy Smoke!!! This is a song of epic proportions. I like it a lot more than Aerials, which is another great song from Toxicity. I agree this is a Metallica sounding song. I mean when Metallica was good, BTW. - 1000/10 <br /> <br />Vincinity of Obscenity - I also agree this song is extremely addicting. I don't think SOAD intended this song to be considered a classic. They probably wanted to add some comic relief to this album. It is downright hilarious! - 7/10 <br /> <br />She's Like Herorine -  This would be the only song I would almost skip. I don't know if it's me but I am not that crazy about it - 7/10 <br /> <br />Lonely Day - Beautiful song -  Unfortunately it's too short for me. I wish it were a little longer. - 10/10 <br /> <br />Soldier Side - A beautiful closing to the Mezmerize/Hypnotize collection. I cannot get this song out of my head. - 15/10 <br /> <br />Well, there you have it. I also want to add that even though I agree Daron's voice is not as great as Serj's his vocals serve an extremely important role to Hypnotize and of course Mezmorize. I would love to see a movie or play made on these two beautiful albums. I am looking forward to more music by this extremely talented group! <br />
055380457X|2.0|This is perhaps a good book for people too busy to have followed Google's rise in the major newspapers and who care little about good writing. The author says he became captivated by Google relatively late (during their Dutch auction style stock offering). He does not make up for that inexperience. <br />   Amazingly, he or his assistant author, in the book make comparisons to Tracy Kidder's Soul of a New Machine. That book, despite focusing on a defunct company of no names, remains a classic. This book to me mostly squanders an opportunity to reveal more about one of the best American success stories today.  <br />   In this match of brand names, ingenuous Google seems to have topped the Washington Post (where the author and his researcher come from), and made the reporting team a bit too awed and docile and thus the story seem too much like auto-generated p.r.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Attack-9/10 Fast paced song with great guitar beat.  A great opening for the CD. <br />Dreaming-6/10 no comment <br />Kill Rock 'N Roll-7/10 no comment <br />Hypnotize-9/10 Deserved to be on Mezmerize. <br />Stealing Society-5.5/10 Too much Daron! and very repetetive. <br />Tentative-7/10 Strange start but overall a good song. <br />U-Fig-6.5/10 no comment <br />Holy Mountains-7.5/10 Has a great beat that keeps you interested throughout the whole song, unlike Mind. <br />Vicinity of Obscenity-7/10 A great start and a funny song, also gets stuck in your head quite easily. Beware. <br />She's Like Heroin-7/10 A creative song, but again too much Daron! <br />Lonely Day-6.5/10 A pretty depressing song.  It sounds like Daron is descibing his life. <br />Soldier Side-8.5/10 A good end to the disk.
B00000JCOV|5.0|The first album of the new slipknot, well back at the time at least, I find it to be Slipknot's best, I bought it a few weeks ago and here's my review <br /> <br />1. 742617000027- The intro to the album and (sic), I know people probably skip it, but I always listen to it before listening to (sic) 3/5 <br />   <br />2. (sic)- Good song, although it's not really standout 3/5 <br /> <br />3. Eyeless- The chorus is very catchy, I like the end when corey screams \\"MUTHAF**KKKAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!\\" 4/5 <br />   <br />4. Wait And Bleed- This is an awesome song, I will never dislike this song 6/5 <br /> <br />5. Surfacing- I really LOVE the chorus, great song to listen to when your in a bad mood 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Spit It Out- At first I didn't like it, but I like it alot more now, 5/5  <br /> <br />7. Tattered & Torn- Strange song, the same thing with Spit it Out, not great though 3/5 <br /> <br />8. Me Inside- Good song, not much to say about it though 5/5 <br /> <br />9. Liberate- Great song, simple as that 6/5  <br /> <br />10. Prosthetics- Strange song, Really like it though, good intro and outro 6/5 <br /> <br />11. No Life- Pretty lame, needs a better chorus 2/5 <br /> <br />12. Diluted- If I could describe this song it would be........Odd, however it's very good, in some strange way 5/5  <br /> <br />13. Only One- I really hate this song,probably my least favourite on the album 2/5 <br /> <br />14. Scissors- I love it, as we approach the end Corey goes completely insane, very good 7/5 <br /> <br />15. Eyeore (Hidden track)- Ok but not great, should have released it as a normal track 3.5/5  <br /> <br />A good album, I would think it's worth the money, but hey, it's your choice
0151907374|1.0|I am an avid reader but couldn't get into this one - stream of consciousness writing seems a way to avoid the trouble of orderly, focused writing.  Back to something solid - like Tolkien, Melville, Trollope, Austen.....

He is much better as a backup singer to Serj and provides good harmony in a song. By trying to push himself as a lead singer he makes the song lose its touch.6/10
0446577383|2.0|This is my first David Baldacci book and will probably be my last. Not that Baldacci isn't a fine writer: he is. But his political views set my teeth on edge. Baldacci is one of those folks who thinks that everything the United States does is tinged wiwth evil and greed. Worse he makes it clear that terrorists who murder innocent men, women and children are just oppressed folks striking back. Baldacci is certainly entitled to express his opinions, though I wouldn't think he would do too well in some of the places he claims are filled with his contemporary \\"freedom-fighters.\\"<br /><br />  Baldacci is most certainly a skilled storyteller. Oliver Stone is a mysterious man, apparently without a past, who has been engaged in a years long protest outside the White House. He even has a tent in Lafayette Park. His banner proclaims \\"I want the truth.\\" Stone and three offbeat colleagues have formed The Camel Club, where they seek to get to the bottom of the dishonesty that pervades Washington. At a late-night meeting in a public park, they watch as a man is murderered. The killers spot them, give chase and the story jumps alive.<br /><br />  Alex Ford is a Secret Service agent tasked to observe the murder investigation, the victim being an employee of a super-secreet intelligence department. Alex is paired with rookie agant Simpson, who happens to be the daughter of a powerful Senator.<br /><br />  The paths of Stone and his club members, Simpson father and daughter, Carter Gray, the nation's intelligence czar and others become increasingly intertwined. Treason is seemingly afoot. A dark conspiarcy is out there with the President as its target.<br /><br />  Baldacci holds things together until the middle of the book. The characters are all flimsy, but his storytelling his vibrant enough to take your mind off that. But then the plot goes into orbit and a solid story falls apart into strands that are clearly plucked out of thin air in an attempt to keep things going. The political rhetoric doesn't, in my opinion, help things but people with a negative view of the US won't share that view.<br /><br />  The last quarter or so of the novel simply fizzles. The plot becomes ridiculous; the action predictable and unbeleivable. The ending is not only predictable, but disappointingly dull.<br /><br />  Baldacci consistently hits the bestseller lists, so he obviously has his fans. I am just not about to become one of them. Nor will I ever become convinced as Baldacci apparently is that the United States is inherently evil and terrorists good. That just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. The odd thing is that the author's political polemic does nothing to advance the story. In almost every instance, it is entirely gratuitous.<br /><br />JerryThe political rhetoric doesn't, in my opinion, help things but people with a negative view of the US won't share that view. <br /> <br />  The last quarter or so of the novel simply fizzles.

B0000942HV|3.0|I'm like the majority of reviewers here: I listened to the original Tubular Bells over and over as a teenager in the 1970s.  You can't expect someone who imprinted so deeply on the original to hear this one with fresh ears.  I bought Tubular Bells 2003 because Oldfield has said it is how he had always intended the piece to sound.  I think he deserves respect and so anyone for whom the original was formative ought to give this one a listen.   <br /> <br />How many times is a master allowed to conduct, or revise, one of his own works?  Think of classical composers before recording technology.  Think of rock bands on tour.  People here have complained that there were at least five versions in thirty years.  That's once every six years.  Why is it annoying?  Yes, it's unusual for a \\"rock album.\\"  Tubular Bells is an unusual piece.  How many recordings of the Grateful Dead's \\"Truckin'\\" are there?  How many times the price of the original vinyl you bought did the value of TB turn out to be?  Back then I was poor, now I'm...less poor.  I really don't mind buying this CD just to check it out.  I don't even mind if Richard Branson gets a cut. <br /> <br />I would be most interested in the views of teenagers who heard and fell in love with this version, and then finally went back and compared the original. <br /> <br />But...I admit TB 2003 is just too shiny and voluptuous for me.  The bass is very basey.  The guitars are more like guitars.  All those...instruments!  There's often a lot of high fizzy sound-- the original had a lot of Farfisa organ, but this one sort of brings it out for you to, er, appreciate and keep appreciating.  Oldfield uses a lot of constant sounds to create atmosphere.  Here they seem less subliminal.  The old piece is like a banquet of Indian curry dishes.  This one is like a meal at a fancy restaurant where every dish is carefully presented on a big plate, in a puddle of purple sauce, decorated with parsely and sculptured bits of carrot. <br /> <br />One minor thing--it can be very disturbing to have this in your iPod on shuffle-all-my-music, and have one of the sections of Tubular Bells play and then suddenly end before the first note of the next section! <br /> <br />It may be that the piece that everyone loved in 1974 was not the piece Oldfield intended, but more of an accident of tape hiss, fatigue, distortion, lack of money and lack of time.  Or maybe most music shouldn't sound exactly the way the composer intended, and modern tech tempts musicians down a garden path of control and perfectionism.  My TB-ROM was burnt long ago.  But it would be interesting to hear Tubular Bells 2003 get a fair trial.
0887307280|5.0|I just logged in to send the E-myth to yet another friend who is struggling with his relatively new business.  I do this as a matter of routine:  every person I have sent the E-myth to has thanked me profusely a couple of years down the line. <br /> <br />I was troubled to read a negative review of the book from some entrepreneurial pundit.  The book has been so important to me and my business that I felt compelled to write my first ever book review to provide a counter-opinion. <br /> <br />Why do I like Gerber's book?  Because he helped me think less like a practioner and more like an owner.  Results?  I am the co-founder of a nearly $50 million/year, 11-year-old regional consulting firm.  Gerber's emphasis on building \\"systems\\" has been vitally influential to me and my business partners.  While no business is 100% dependent on systems, adopting a \\"systematic\\" approach to running the business is very important if one desires to own a business and have a life too.
B000002KMY|5.0|Wow, flip a coin between this one and its more glorfied predecessor 'Heaven and Hell' as far as I'm concerned as to which is the better record. Sabbath scored arguably the greatest one-two punch of their stellar career, and their last relevant one to boot. Dio continues has (witch)crafty hold over the band started by Tony and Geezer, and the thrill ride continues. Bill Ward is gone by this point, health being the major issue so Vinnie Appice takes over to make this version of Sabbath and Anglo-American band, not that this matters, the metal is still gothic european influenced. Key tracks include personal faves \\"Voodoo\\" (the groove here is dynamite, could be my alltime favorite Dio/Sabbath song), the title cut (also featured in the film \\"Heavy Metal\\"), \\"Falling Off the Edge of the World\\", \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" and \\"Turn Up the Night\\" (while not as great an opener as \\"Neon Knights\\", still powerful). The band's association with producer Martin Birch helped create a powerhouse sound, especially the rhythm section. A live album and stupid cat fight between Dio and Iommi would kill Sabbath for the rest of the decade although they soldiered on first with Ian Gillan then as a Tony Iommi vanity project, but the black magic was gone. Unfortunately for them and not for metal, their original frontman was well on his way to becoming a superstar with a legendary 1980-1981 of his own. Black Sabbath will always be remembered as Ozzy's old band but don't forget for that a brief period in the early '80's how awesome the Ronnie James Dio years were.

0553801503|5.0|Volume Four of this series goes much deeper into character, and while I understand that some readers may be put off by this, Martin's writing is so magnificent that I hardly care if \\"not much happens.\\"  A lot really does happen, but it is not the overt violence and action that can be found in the first three books.  I love the three-dimensional, complex characters, and I am in awe of Martin's talent and imagaination.  Now, the long wait until Volume Five!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This movie was more then a horror-suspense movie.  Although some may say differently, this movie WAS based on true facts of a 19 year old girl, whose name was Anneliese Michel, and it happened in the late 1970's.  This movie just grabs you by the neck and sucks you in.  After you've started watching it, hold on for dear life, you're in for one \\"hell\\" of a ride.   <br />     It's been a long time since I walked out of a movie crying and shaking for 30 minutes.  I can't wait for it to come out so I can just keep watching it.  It's like not wanting to stare at someone getting in trouble, but just not being able to tear your eyes away from it.  I'm not sure it's the best movie for a someone under 15 or so, but for those adults out there who KNOW there's something out there that has more power over us, it's a must-see.   <br />     I reccomend this to ANYONE who wants to see a movie that is not only scary on many levels, but a movie that gets right into your head and shakes things up like they've never been shaken before.   <br />     It's incredible....many bows to the director and actors of this \\"documentary\\" unlike any other.   <br />
B0009IW88A|4.0|James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer have produced some fine Batman music. Instead of using heroic themes they have created a dark and brooding score. Here are the tracks. <br /> <br />Vespertillio: The two Batman themes are contained on this track. One is a two-note theme with a good beat in the background. The other one is a creepy and sinister piece of music that is used when Batman stalks his criminal victims. <br /> <br />Eptesicus: This track starts with sad music and alter gives us the music from when Bruce Wayne is training. <br /> <br />Myotis: This starts out slow, but it suddenly goes into an upbeat action theme. <br /> <br />Barbastella: A pretty slow-[aced track. THe last thirty seconds is pretty good, however. <br /> <br />Atribeus: The first two minutes contains music from when Batman beats up Falcone and his gang. The rest is random pieces from other parts of the movie, including something that might be Ra's Al Ghul's theme. <br /> <br />Tadarida: This cool track contains some pretty \\"interesting\\" sounds, especially the music that accompanies the fear gas. <br /> <br />Macrotus: The first couple of minutes are emotionally awesome, but the rest of this seven minute track is pretty boring and slow-going. <br /> <br />Antrozus: Here is some music from when Batman goes off to save Gotham City from Ra's Al Ghul. <br /> <br />Nycteris: One of my favorite tracks. It starts off with the theme played while Mr. Fox shows Bruce Wayne some high-tech gear. It then goes into some other cool music. <br /> <br />Molossus: Pretty fast-paced and awesome action music. <br /> <br />Corynorhinus: All of the ending music is played here, including the love and Batman themes. <br /> <br />Lasirus: Pretty slow-paced track that isn't as boring as Macrotus. <br /> <br />Overall, this soundtrack is a good buy, but the slow music sometimes plays too long. Almost every track has a good beat or rythm.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|This cd is absolutely amazing.  These young guys (the oldest is 19) have talent.  The first half is mixed with a sound board and techno-ish sounds, and the last half with piano and violen.  This makes for a great fresh sound.  I love every song, but my favorites are 'Camisado' and 'Build God, Then We'll Talk'.  These guys are amazing writers for being so young, and are worth listening to! I'd buy this if i were you, they are worth the money and your time.  In my top three bands.

Or maybe the tactics you anti-Mariah people are all complaining about are things all artists do.  Let's see, Janet Jackson, Taylor Dayne, Celine Dion, and goodness knows who else have done the re-release special edition. <br /> <br />As far as Mariah's album here (which barely anyone is talking about), I have to admit, without the DVD it wouldn't be worth the price.  But the videos are pretty good (all actual expensive-looking videos, I hated the way some of her older videos were just concert or in-studio recordings) so they make up for just four new songs.  Once again she hits the urban sound pretty hard, so only get 'em if you're interested in her club-ish stuff.  I'm actually pretty happy with the new songs, especially the intense fast-spoken So Lonely, but considering there's still Sprung and Secretlove out there (two bonus tracks from international releases), the least they could have done is included those too.   <br />The original album itself was, by my standards for Mariah, good but not great, only worth three stars anyway, in case you haven't bought the original release yet.  The uptempo tracks, for once, are the big winners, while virtually all the ballads have a purposely 70's feel that gets old quickly (think Fourth of July or Underneath the Stars).  She's obviously trying to ditch the Walter Afanasieff power ballad sound from the Music Box years, which is her prerogative, but some of us LIKED that.  We Belong Together and Don't Forget About Us are the only really contemporary sounding slow songs, and I skip almost all the 2nd half of the album except To The Floor.  <br /> <br />So overall, I think one or two extra songs would make a re-release more worth it, but the DVD helps a lot.  It's Christmastime, so if you're that undecided, ask for it for a gift. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003XAQ5|5.0|Now with the SACD version I have hit my fifth copy of the great classic: original off-pitch CD issue, pitch corrected CD with bonus track, Davis/Coltrane Columbia box set, bootleg Complete Session and SACD.  It's a pity that the SACD release didn't take the opportunity to issue the complete sessions which includes breakdowns and studio talk. <br /> <br />All the reviews I have read of this release miss what this very obviously is: a transfer of the three channel master or safety.  Blue was recorded to three track with tenor/piano in one, trumpet/bass in 2 and alto/drums in three which neatly corresponds to L/C/R on the SACD.  There is breakthrough from the instruments into each of the channels as the horn mikes were kept fully open during the recording.  The drums were clearly isolated as there is very little breakthrough from them.  Much the same for the bass so you do really need a full-range centre speaker to give justice to Paul Chambers.  There is no sub channel and the rear is just digital reverb so I turn it off as the original recording was sweetened with some reverb. <br /> <br />If you have the pitch-correct CD then this is not essential as the stereo mix is quite excellent and gives an expansiveness to all the instruments.  However if you are seriously into Miles then this is worth it with his trumpet fully on show in the centre channel.  I again must emphasis -you will need a full range centre speaker not the standard restricted range ones provided in surround-sound systems i.e. missing the low octave or two which contains the double bass's lowest notes.  I rebuilt mine when I got the SACD Tommy which had Entwhistle's bass centre channel - 2 x 6\\" speakers didn't cut it even with a sub. <br />
B0007OCG4W|3.0|\\"Closer,\\" if nothing else, is a refreshing change for major movie releases in that it truly defies established formulas.  If your best friend said that there was a new movie about love and romance and it stars Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Jude Law (plus the rakishly handsome Clive Owen), you'd probably leap to the conclusion that a studio had tried to make \\"Love Actually II\\" or some other sappy romantic comedy.    Nothing could be further from the truth.  In a movie that revolves intensely around the four leads as two couples who, shall we say, \\"interact,\\" it's hard to find a likable chap or gal.  Selfishness and betrayal rule the day, along with graphic language about sex.  I'm not talking overly clinical language, I'm talking about the language of people who use sex as a means to establish dominance and superiority, not intimacy or even enjoyment.  Guilt and shame are at least as prevalent as love and affection, and truth may be the rarest commodity of all.    Be warned -- this is not a feel-good movie in any way.  That's not to say that it's a \\"bad movie,\\" of course.  My three-star rating stems from the fact that the movie spans a few years, yet the transitions between leaps forward and flashes back are confusing, and the characters generally talk like movie characters and not real people (listening to Jude Law explain his job as a writer of obituaries rings false, and I'm not sure a woman like Natalie Portman's character \\"Alice\\" has ever walked the earth).     Still, if you're looking for a dark examination of the war between the sexes (and we are talking about war), and you've worn out your copy of \\"In the Company of Men,\\" or you find \\"The War of the Roses\\" too cheery, this may be just the movie for you.

B00005V9IL|5.0|I have lost count on how many times I have returned to The Abyss' site at Amazon, DESPERATELY hoping to find that there has been a totally new, remastered, anamorphic version of this wonderful movie released. <br /> <br />Reading Paul Schorsch's review has prompted me to post another 2 cents worth - I have exactly the same problem with my widescreen CRT TV - every version of the DVD that I have purchased (4 at last count - 3 region 1, 1 region 4)lock in as \\"squashed\\" letterbox as Paul has experienced. I alwasy thought it was my DVD player until I moved to my 3rd so guessed it must be my TV.If I set aspect ratio to \\"auto\\", the picture will jump into correct aspect ratio when the scene is bright but flips back to squashed when the scene is dark, i.e. about 80% of the movie.  <br /> <br />The movie is definitely 5 stars, all current DVDs rate zero stars (unwatchable) as far as I am concerned.

B000BM6AVA|2.0|daron please shut the f@#ck up. just play guitar and sing backup vocals. i love the 1st 3 system albums, but these last to are just average at best. one of the main reasons i like system so much is serj's singing. now daron seems to think he's the lead singer. it's pretty sad that there b-side album is better than these last 2 so called albums. serj grow some balls and tell daron if he wants to sing, release a solo project and leave the singing to serj on the next system album.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|If you agree or match 3 of the following reasons, you should buy this album with no disappointment!!   <br /> <br />1) You didn't own the original one which was released in 1994. <br /> <br />2) You need a christmas album to enhance your christmas spirit and celebration. <br /> <br />3) You really like those Mariah's video performance from these christmas songs <br /> <br />4) You are Mariah's die hard fans, you will buy it anyway though you have the original one!! <br /> <br />5) You are new Mariah's fans <br /> <br />6) You are thinking about buying a x'mas present to your loved ones. <br /> <br />7) You own a 5.1 surround stereo system! <br /> <br />8) Mariah has a come back success this year, so her christmas songs would be big hits again this xmas all over the world!!! <br /> <br />9) $14 bucks for 12 songs plus 8 dvd videos, it worths the price!! <br />  <br />10) You (still) believe in Santa Claus!!  : ) <br />
0553801503|3.0|The fourth book in the Song of Fire and Ice series isn't as good as the previous three. It's a little slow (he's veering a little too close to Robert Jordan for my taste), but it's still a good read and a definite recommendation for fans of the series.
B00000255F|5.0|\\"Meeting Across The River\\" is still the classic amongst the other giants. A sonic joy to listen to, tight rhythm section, and great lyrics.<br /><br />I'm not a big rock n'roll fan, but this is one of the select pieces...\\"The Yes Album\\" from Yes, \\"A Night at the Opera\\" from Queen, and Plays Ballads\\" from Ben Webster also come to mind...that shine from beginning to end.<br /><br />Just buy it.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|An hour-long dose of pure joy.  Thanks Madonna.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Sorry, Hung Up and Jump are the only songs I really enjoyed on this album. I found myself skipping many of the other tracks, I just wasn't very impressed by it as I am with her other CD's. Although I wouldn't say it's full of filler tracks which it's not Madge puts passion into each song but I just don't find them appealing. <br /> <br />I'm really at a loss if I would recommend it or not, I would recommend 3 or 4 tracks but not the CD as a total. I would recommend some of her older CD's if you want to hear Madge at her best. If you decide not to buy the album I would definitely suggest you buy those 3 tracks I mentioned.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|After listening to Gavin DeGraw's CD \\"Chariot\\", I was unsure about how I felt.  The reason for the rating I gave is how much of the background music in his songs blends in with other artists out there, It doesn't stand out too well.<br /><br />  And Who should expect it to?  this is DeGraw's freshman release, he's still trying to come into himself.  Songs like \\"Nice to Meet you\\" blend in to  what is already going on in the music world.  The quality of his singing is also not of the highest calibur, which kept the rating from 4 stars.<br /><br />  Songs like \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Just friends\\" show his musical talenty and emotion with which he can capture with lyrics.  And while two of the strongest song on the album, they revert back to what is safe (musically) just when the song has the ability to strike new ground.  I say, blame the producer, not the artist.  \\"More Than anyone\\", my favorite on the album, show hints of willingness to break out of the John Mayer/Maroon  mold while holding onto something special (a bit remniscent of McCartney?).  While a solid CD, if DeGraw takes bolder steps in the future, I would expect his sophmore album to bring great things.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|I've never read Clive Cussler so I can't compare the movie to his novel, but I enjoyed the film. It's not a classic and it won't win any awards but it will entertain you. Dirk Pitt and his pal Al Giordano are treasure hunters looking for an ironclad ship from the American Civil War that may have somehow ended up in Africa. Penelope Cruz plays a doctor from the WHO investigating a new illness spreading from an African country. They cross paths and together find the source of the disease and eventually find the Civil War ship. The plot is preposterous and you never believe Cruz as a WHO physician but the movie is action packed from beginning to end and Steven Zahn as sidekick Al provides some genuinely funny moments. Sahara delivers exactly what it sets out to, a few hours of mindless entertainment.
B00005JNEI|2.0|How would you like to be some 19 or 20 American soldier, having to survive 120 degree days in the Sunni Triangle, wearing 90 pounds of clumsy gear, eating nasty food, surrounded by streets full of filth, funky smells, and people wishing you would die, because you took away their boy Saddam. They miss oppressing their neighbors and being in charge of a country so run into the ground that there has no been no hope for generations, so they cook up schemes to get the dumbest among them to drive a truck bomb into your checkpoint. You have to spend over one year in this pleasant environment away from family, friends...all for this great notion of freedom, so this whale can criticize what you are doing, since he hates living in the land of liberty, PS2, the Wal-Mart lower prices yellow bouncing ball, Starbucks Mocha lattes, Volvos, free internet porn, the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, and the 24 hour 7 eleven slushee made by the Pakistani immigrant who fantasizes not of Al-Qaeda bombings, but of someday owning his own ethnic restaurant on the rich yuppie side of town. Yeah this great guy is great, capitalizing on our soldier's deaths to make a living. I'd respect you more/Moore if you had actually served like John Murtha or Chuck Hagel.....But hey as long as people keep buying your DVD, getting your message out...I bet you even drive an SUV.
0141301120|5.0|This book is a worthy successor to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Maybe not quite as good, but still very satisfying.  For Bill Herring and his unfortunate son, I would recommend \\"Retarded Isn't Stupid, Mom!\\" by Sandra Z. Kaufman.  It'll help you through some tough times.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|Firefly had so much promise and momentum built up until those no-pulse stiffs at Fox canceled it. What a bunch of no-clue goofs!! Now to Serenity, it was a great movie to watch.....until they whacked the preacher and Wash. WTW was Wedon thinking???? The preacher, alone, had so much character developement possibilies worked up; I just could not understand how this could have even entered Wedon's mind. Unabelievable!!! Then Wash gets it!!!! You gotta' be friggin' kidin' me. UN-FRIGGIN'-BELIEVABLE!!!! Ok, let's just create a cast of characters that all work together like no other large cast and start killing them off in the movie based on the series. Now, seeing what heppened in the movie, I, SERIOUSLY, would not be suprised if Wedon kills the rest of them off in the next movies, that is if the series fans can stomach another movie like this one to make it financially possible. As a stand-alone film, it was great. As a continuation of the series, it was a huge mistake to do what Wedon did. Can't wait to get the DVD previewed at block buster.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|I rented this movie on Wednesdasy night and didn't dare on watching it until Thursday morning! When it comes to movies, I love action, anime andcomdey. But I also love horror! This movie was not rated until 1994 and it was rated NC-17! When I watched it, I could see why! The story was awsome, acting was good, and the gore was unbelieveable and was the best I've ever seen! For a movie made in 1979, this movie felt like a classic up to date horror flick! It was directed by Sam Raimai, the director of Spiderman, when we was very young! This was great,<br /><br />and I can't wait to see the sequels!<br /><br />Oh yeah! They are also remaking the movie for next year! I can't wait to see it!
B00005JO1J|3.0|\\"Rent\\" is a thrilling, emotional experience on the stage: take it from someone who has seen the show on Broadway twice and in a primo road show version in Los Angeles starring Dougie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris) three times.<br />But that was a number of years ago and though this Chris Columbus directed filmed version of \\"Rent\\" tries awfully hard to recapture the revolutionary feel of the new-to-Broadway-in-1994 subject matter (AIDS, drug addiction, etc.) and the re-writing and re-imagining of Puccini's \\"La Boheme\\" (by the super-talented Jonathan Larson)...it doesn't, though a couple of the scenes are knockouts: Mimi's (a dynamic, sultry, sexy Rosario Dawson) \\"Out Tonight\\" and the touching scene between Mimi and Roger (Adam Pascal) \\"Light My Candle.\\"<br />Overall there is a nagging feeling of been there done that about this entire film though once again I must re-iterate: the songs are first rate at least and glorious at best plus all the performers do a bang-up job of singing, acting and dancing.<br />Unfortunately and frankly most of the performers are just too old for these parts: all of these actors were in the original Broadway production some 10 years ago. Remember this is a story about Gen X early twenty year olds and though they perform well: Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel (Mark, Roger, Angel and Maureen) look like what they are, mid-thirty year olds. More importantly though, an essentially young person's concerns, problems and manner of looking at life juxtaposed onto someone who appears well into his or her 30's makes the characters pathetic and hopeless rather than tragic and hopeful and this friction irreparably damages the film to it's core.<br />Sadly then, \\"Rent\\" is a disappointment: a case of a show with excellent bones whose body begs, really needs to be updated to transform it into as smartly cast, cogent, with-it, and profound as it was 10+ years ago.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|I found some lyric creativity,but with the constant sampling of songs that occurs these days,one must wonder when somebody will go out on a limb and develope a rythm or melody on thier own.I expected a little more in that category from the great one,but was dissappointed considering what she has come up with in the passed.definately some good tracks,but i am still waiting for the next ray of light.....
B000B8QEYC|5.0|There is a familarity and a contentment with breathing in a new Enya album.  The day I found out she had a new one coming out, I felt very warm and relaxed, a feeling like one that comes with realizing you'd be going to visit and get reacquainted with a dear friend you haven't visited in a while, just to catch up and be in her presence.  I am still getting acquainted with all of the pieces of music.  But there were immediate feelings.  When I was listening to \\"It's in the rain\\" I literally felt shivers and bristles of chills up my back as her voice melted over me.  It had a cadence that rocked me back and forth. It reminds me of some of the quality vocal performances on The Celts.  Her voice is very stunning on that track.  The following track, \\"If I could be where you are\\", had similar immediate effects on me.  Right now it is about even between those two as being my favorite pieces on this album.  Like I do with many pieces of music, I like to personalize them.  \\"If I could be where you are\\" was immediately personalized to a long missed love, but memories of that person alive in me told me to turn the song inward....a song that I have personalized to be about looking for my \\"inner self\\", and probably my inner kiddo--who I see as a 5-year-old warm and relaxed, playing, and grinning in the sun on a fresh grass hill)...a part of me that I long to reconnect with.  The singer is looking for answers of how to find this missing love.  Is there a sign?  Is there a road?  And there is still a remnant of this missing love.  The voice sings, \\"In the darkness of my dreaming, the light of you will stay\\".  Darkness here, but the light of that love remains inside...a hope it can be found.  (I might have just now convinced myself that this is my favorite song.) <br /> <br />I read some reviews here say it is sad album.  But I think that can be a product of viewpoint and perception.  Yes there is some melancholy, but there is also hope and searching and fond memories. <br /> <br />Everyone should sit down to get reacquainted with this dear friendly voice.  She will warm you.    <br /> <br />My wish for a future album is that she sings \\"Amazing Grace.\\"  I'd love to see what she does with that song.
B000BJ7BCK|2.0|This movie is one cliche after another.  If you happen to like that, then maybe you'll enjoy the movie.  But trust me... it's nowhere near as good as The Incredibles, from which it obviously borrows shamelessly.  If you like shows about kids with powers, you'd be FAR better off downloading NARUTO, which is awesome!
B000BNX3B4|2.0|It seems a shame that a movie starring two of the more likable screen actors today, Diane Lane and John Cusack, would end up being such an overly deliberate Hollywood contrivance. Although the film topically addresses the world of online matchmaking, it doesn't feel relevant given the tendency toward convention. It's not too surprising to find out that this is the product of TV sitcom director-writer Gary David Goldberg as it feels like there is an absent laugh track with pauses after certain line readings to make room for the gales of laughter that never really come. This is the type of movie that depends on a sing-along with \\"The Partridge Family\\" theme song for a nostalgic guffaw.<br /><br />The story centers on Sarah, an attractive, fortyish woman freshly divorced and prodded by her meddlesome family to start dating again. I think it could have helped if Lane, wallowing in self-doubt and analysis paralysis, did not play such a similar character in last year's \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\". This time she's a pre-school teacher with - surprise! - a love for dogs. As is routine with this sort of set-up, Sarah is surrounded by stock characters - an acid-tongued, married older sister, Carol, who submits Sarah's online profile behind her back; a bromide-spouting father with a brogue that would make Barry Fitzgerald wince; a happily partnered colleague with a heart of gold; and Bob, a recently separated man who may or may not have the best intentions in pursuing Sarah. Complicating matters is Jake, an iconoclastic, \\"Doctor Zhivago\\"-loving boat-builder who immediately falls for Sarah.<br /><br />Even though Lane is as lovely as usual (and constantly reminded of this by her family) and Cusack seems to default easily back to his Lloyd Dobler persona from \\"Say Anything\\", it's hard to see why Jake falls for Sarah given her continuing trepidation, but alas, that seems to be the only viable point of conflict in the plot since there is so little character development. A sturdy supporting cast is wasted - Elizabeth Perkins back to second-banana status as the sister; Christopher Plummer somewhere between twinkly philosopher and aging lothario as the father; Dermot Mulroney whose character Bob is made so inconsistent as to render his subplot confusing; Ben Shenkman irritating as Jake's sleazy lawyer best friend and Stockard Channing sorely misused as a trailer-park hippie woman infatuated with Sarah's father.<br /><br />Granted there are a few chuckles (for example, when they careen through town hunting for a condom), the movie feels disjointed with scenes that simply stop and start with little sense of plot development other than getting to its inevitable ending. Goldberg doesn't have the sensibilities of a Cameron Crowe to get away with such an eccentric cast of characters, and the plot just feels overloaded with clich&eacute;s. Even with Lane and Cusack, the film should sadly be passed over.ted - Elizabeth Perkins back to second-banana status as the sister; Christopher Plummer somewhere between twinkly philosopher and aging lothario as the father; Dermot Mulroney whose character Bob is made so inconsistent as to render his subplot confusing; Ben Shenkman irritating as Jake's sleazy lawyer best friend and Stockard Channing sorely misused as a trailer-park hippie woman infatuated with Sarah's father.

B000002AHC|5.0|I first heard this album in a friend's record collection and decided to buy it. Yes this album is dated but not nearly as much as say 70's arena rock. This is clearly the high water mark of the Byrds career, when they stopped copping Dylan and found their sound. Psychadelic, with more than a touch of country (which would eventually overwhelm their albums)and Moog trappings, the album works. I don't really care about the conflict between David Crosby and the rest of the band (the bonus tracks are skippable). What I see in this album is a wistful sincerity for childhood and innocence. A song like \\"Change is Now\\" with the refrain, \\"dance for the day when fear is gone\\" suddenly sounds eerily contemporary.  And as for the more dated songs like Dolphin's Smile and Space Odyssey are redeemed by the effects (which took weeks if not months of overdubbing at the time).  I can't say this album is ahead of its time or pre-punk or anything else people use to make acceptable to enjoy an album of this kind.  Its just good pop songs, with wit and intelligence, something hard if not impossible to find in mainstream rock these days.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|having been a fan of dream theater since the days of charlie dominici and when they had recently recovered from their majsesty days; this album made me very, very sad. The album is very artistic  in what they are trying to do, you can tell the skill is there, but for the most part the musicians sound bored. Utterly bored. I'm sure that there is something else they could have been doing besides making this album,like i don't know... smashing their fingers with a hammer. its not inspiring, there is no real virtuouso performances. There are no \\"wow\\" moments whatsoever on this album. I bought this album used and i can honestly see why someone decided to unload it. I am still loyal to the band to see what type of redemption album they will put out. But i am a bit leary. It is reminiscent of metallica diversifying their musical choices after the black album, and look at their fan base now.

Perfect casting of the voices as well.  Hard to go wrong with watching this movie, even if it is an animation.  This is definitely in the same class as Shrek.
0307276902|1.0|The worst part of this book is that it's written as if it's happening in real time.  Were it a journal - something the author contributed to on a day to day basis - it would be more honest.  But as it stands it's a memoir of sorts and seems romanticized.<br /><br />James really pitied himself for having to go through recovery.  He wanted the reader to feel how perilous his life had become while using.  He wanted the reader to care that he stayed clean because if he didn't he would die.  He even went so far as to write an obituary, which is more like a resume on his drug career than what would actually be printed.<br /><br />Also, the menial style in which the story was written was abhorrent.  Maybe the chronic repetition is symptomatic of a drug abuser but it was quite annoying.<br /><br />Congratulations, James, you are the first author I have quit reading because I don't care to know how your story ends.

B000BB1MHS|3.0|Weird, creepy and strange. It was exactly these words that came into my mind after watching `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.' Yes, I know, this is a Tim Burton film, in which being weird means quirky type of charms, but for all its considerable merits, I was not charmed by the film. <br /> <br />You don't need the long summery of the story. In short, good boy Charlie Bucket and other four bad kids are invited to the magical factory of one Willy Wonka. For bad kids only, the factory turns a horrible place, where they must learn a lesson in a fairly terrifying way. Rather cruel edge of the original remains in the film, and that part actually is the point of the film, when the preachy moral is told in a well-rehearsed musical style. You may hate this, but still can find it more tolerable than Depp and his acting, which, unlike `Finding Neverland,' would not bring him another Oscar nomination. <br /> <br />Too bad, but it's true. The acting of Johnny Depp, and the unnecessary subplot about Mr. Wonka are the worst part of the film. The unfortunate comparison with Michael Jackson is understandable if you just watch him. Even if the avid fans of Depp can ignore the uncanny resemblance between Jackson and Depp wearing sunglasses, they would certainly admit that his acting here is misguided, always - yes, always - relying on curious mannerism. He is constantly weird, and to make matters much worse, seems not conscious of what he is doing. <br /> <br />To remedy the alarming amount of weirdness, Tim Burton added the father-son relation between Wonka and his father, stern dentist played his favorite actor Christopher Lee. That only makes the whole story unnecessarily longer and more sentimental. After so much of Depp's bizarre acting, it is too late for anyone to correct the image of the eccentric factory owner, and make him look more like a human. Better acting would do. <br /> <br />Ironically, the film is much better when it doesn't show Wonka in it. The house of the Buckets, slanted in a crazy way, shows what Tim Burton can do with better and level-headed judgment, and the entire household is charmingly described. David Kelly provides a delightful portrait of a wise old man in the family, with a little bit of craziness hidden in his eyes. <br /> <br />For all its wonderful designs and good Danny Elfman score, I couldn't help thinking about this. As many have already pointed out about this film, Depp's Wonka repeatedly betrays his dislike of being addressed to by the children while he can talk pretty normally (though drily) with adults. So why should he invite these kids to the factory? Or why should all the kids dream about going to his factory in the first place? I talked about weird things about the film - Michael Jackson theory and so on - but this is the weirdest part of the film, which I am still trying to figure out.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|All I can say about this album is welcome back Madonna. For all of those Madonna fans out there who have not been too sure about where Madonna's musical direction has been going for a while---the present direction is \\"to the top\\". This album is a perfect modern blend of exotic tunes, hip dance beats and disco. It has been a long time since we have seen Madonna like this.....a perfect gift for any Madonna fan and for anyone who has not been converted to one yet---this album will surely change that! <br />My favorite tracks are \\"Hung Up\\",\\"Get Together\\", \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Isaac\\"!!! <br />Awesome--just Awesome.  <br />
B0007OCG56|2.0|I know what to expect from Adam Sandler movies (it's not all bad), but it comes as no surprise when the basic plot was stale and flaccid.  But what \\"was\\" a surprise was the ending.  I thought it was irresponisble and undermining.  The truth is that we have an ever growing conflict between the Mexican movement and the estamishment that is American.  We say to people welcome and reap the rewards of becoming part of the American community. But what we hear in return is, \\"Thanks, but no thanks. We'll gladly take what ever we can get from America but we don't what to be held to your standards\\".  And in the ending we apperantly hear that loud and clear - It is more important to stay true to your nationality than it is to allow the offspring to advance in away that can only be done by embraceing America mind, heart and soul.    The other interpratation maybe: a mother (reguardless of nationality) forceing a child to choose mother over evolution of the mind.     \\"Get an Education and upset your mother?! As Seinfeld would say, \\"What's up with that?\\"      Other than that the movie was entirely useless. Good only for some mental down time and good brown stare.    Sorry, if the review is too heavy.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is by standards a difficult movie to understand and by reading all of these reviews, well it's surprising how many people didn't understand it. This is my first Lynch film and I intend on seeing Lost Highway. I greatly enjoyed Mulholland Drive as it blended comedy with drama and has some surreal aspects to it.  <br />The thing about this movie is that you shouldn't focuss on one point early on and be like \\"what the heck is going on?\\" This movie will explain it all in the end and if you pay attention, well it's pretty easy to understand.  <br />I will now summarize the entire movie in case you need some help understanding it. <br />The movie opens with a lady named Rita who is about to be murdered until a car crashes into hers. She survives and hides in an apartment complex, shocked. Meet Betty, played magnificently by the always brilliant Naomi Watts. She is staying in her aunt's apartment in Los Angeles as she wants to become an actress. But Rita's in her new place. They become friends, and Betty finds lots of money in Rita's purse. What is going on? While Betty continued to rehearse, she starts having a love affair with Rita in some \\"famous\\" lesbian scenes. Then comes a movie director who is wrapped up in a serious mess, getting in troulbe with mobs, his wife cheating on him, etc... <br />The movie kkeps on going at this crazy pace until Rita and Betty discover the dead body of a lady name Diane. Back to reality now.  <br />Rita and Betty turn out to be figures of Diane's imagination. Why? Because Diane was in love with the real Rita until she left him for the movie director. The real Diane isn't as beautiful at all as herself in her imagination. Diane gets mad and jealous and hires a hitman to kill her (that's where the money comes from that we found in Rita's purse). But when the job gets done, and Diane finds the blue key signifying the death of Rita...well Diane goes mad. She envisions this alternate reality where her life with Rita is going wonderfully while the director's life is going horribly. But then Diane wakes up and is haunted by what she did and commits suicide. <br /> <br />I hope that that helped better understand this masterpiece. It is one of the most original movies I have ever seen and also one of the most fascinating. El Club Silencio is really neat as is Naomi Watt's acting. She is so talented. Best Actress Ever! <br />And by the way, this movie has the best line of all time: after the crook's gun accidentally goes off and through the wall, you hear a lady scream..he goes to see if she's dead or not..and she says: (the fat lady is pointing to her but) \\"Something bit me bad!\\" So hilarious! And that's not all, this movie is full of stuff like that as well as very sad and tragic moments. So please reconsider this movie and watch it because you don't know what you're missing out on.
B00000099Y|5.0|i want to formally apologize on the behalf of myself. i am sorry you guys feel the need to go buy this album when you're barely open minded enough to leave your own home. you can be a christian and listen to the song eulogy. i'm willing to bet you watched the passion of the christ, which even as a non-christian i still consider an abomination. the truth is tool has progressively improved upon themselves through every album. every album has been better than the last. for most of you, tool would probably be better off having never known you ever picked up their cd(s). if you're looking for just some new tunes to show of to all your friends, pick any other band besides tool. unlike most of you, theyre about the music and theyre simply getting as close as they can to perfecting their music. lateralus was, in my book, their best release to date. the only thing that could ever come close would be the next album. i am 110% confident it will kick more ass than ever.  <br /> <br />bottom line is this album kicked ass. their albumS before this one kicked ass. they will continue kicking ass until they cease to exist. oh and by the way, if you think you've got all the tool albums think again. undertow was not the first you jackasses. <br /> <br />p.s. when my album appears on here, would you guys just please not say anything at all? kthxbye!
B000000OSG|5.0|Reading the exhausting but brilliant spotlight reviews on this album, I decided to combine my reviews of I and II onto this page.  The Amazon.com review is more to the point, and can really be said of all double albums.  Excise the filler and combine the gold, and usually you have an ambitious, stunning project.<br /><br />Welcome to my version of Use Your Illusion.<br /><br />1) You Could be Mine--what a slamming opening track this would be!! Matt and Duff's rhythm section can be felt in your spine, and Axl's lyrics are vicous and world weary all at once.  Try to ignore the T2 video tie-in, however.<br /><br />2)Yesterdays--What a great song.  Manages to walk the line between power ballad and country rock.  \\"Yesterday's got nothin' for me.\\" If only you believed it and lived it, Axl.<br /><br />3)Don't Cry(original)--Another stunning song.  I am a big U2 fan, and this reminds me a lot of \\"One\\" so I would put it in the same spot that \\"One\\" occupies on \\"Achtung Baby.\\"<br /><br />4)November Rain/Estranged--The most ambitious and sprawling epic power ballad I've heard in the past 20 years.  However, one of the only problems I had with UYI is that \\"Estranged\\" is virtually the same song, but with a harder edge. So in the interest of album length, I have released two versions, pick your fave :)<br /><br />5)Dust and Bones/14 Years--See # 4.  Couldn't decide between these two, they were so similar, so you can get the alternate version.<br /><br />6)Bad Apples/Bad Obsession--The songs The Black Crowes wish they could have written.  \\"It's a cold day in the continental drift\\" drunk, drug-fueled, sitting in your mansion with the Flavor Flav \\"Boyee!!!\\" at the end. And Bad Obsession \\"I Called my mother/She's just a c*** now.\\" Wow. Insane. Muscially too similar to have on the same album.<br /><br />7)Right Next Door to Hell---Kicks off the 2nd half of the album by barricading itself in the apartment with a shotgun looking out a peephole.  Bring it on!<br /><br />8)Live and Let Die--Keep this one and toss Heaven's Door.  Not bad, but LALD blows away HD, and also makes me think of GNR 1st, Macca 2nd. (Sorry, Paul.)<br /><br />9)Pretty Tied Up--A fierce rocker kickin' you right in the gut. \\"Crack the whip and that bitch is just insane (I'm serious.)\\"<br /><br />10)You Ain't the First--Aside from the Physical Graffiti-style studio mumbling before and after this song, what a perfect continuation of \\"Used to Love Her.\\"<br /><br />11)Civil War--All things said, this may be the finest song the Gunners have ever recorded, and not just for the subject matter.  Axl's voice show vulnerability and pain in the low register.<br /><br />12)Locomotive--Now Axl's world implodes as we head to the abyss of his paranoia.  Another great rocking song.<br /><br />13)Breakdown--After having epic power ballads on this album, Axl also has epic just plain rockers like this one and Locomotive, pure, long rock songs that just don't fade away or go soft at all.<br /><br />14)Coma--There really is no other way to end this album other than staging your own death, like all great epics.<br /><br />I welcome all criticism of the track selection.8)Live and Let Die--Keep this one and toss Heaven's Door.

B000021YQV|5.0|From the opening strums of Prison song to the Middle eastren ending of Aerials Systems Toxicity is a soilid cd.  Not quite as good as the Self Titled cd (which is probely my personal favorite) but what is.  The witty lyrics of their songs mixed with the amazing bass playing and exceptional singing of Serj Tankianin makes this a solid cd from start to finish. If you dont allready own this exceptional cd i would strongly suggest getting it right away
B000001E18|5.0|It's almost comical to read a review like the one Warchild wrote.  \\"Close, but no guitar\\".  Hilarious.  Of course, if anyone had been listening to Achtung Baby at all, they could have predicted U2's sonic shift.  Alas, some of us still want the \\"old U2\\", a phrase which makes me shudder every time I hear it.  \\"I Will Follow\\" \\"Gloria\\" \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" \\"Pride\\" \\"Still Haven't Found\\" \\"Streets\\" \\"Bullet\\" \\"Desire\\"<br /><br />What a roll call of wonderful guitar-driven rock and roll that defined a sound in the 80's.<br /><br />But U2, like all human beings, found time to grow up and expand.<br /><br />After the success of AB, while still on tour, U2 took a 6 week break, ostensibly to record a four or five track EP before the last leg of their tour.  Like most of U2's ideas, this one grew to a full length album.<br /><br />And they hit one out of the park.<br /><br />1)Zooropa---simply the most foreboding opening to a U2 song ever, before Edge's GUITAR kicks in with a sinister wah wah effect.  Bono's disorientation is clear from the outset, as he places Zooropa square in the middle of advertising slogans.<br /><br />2)Babyface---A sweet high tech love song, presumably sung to a woman on a TV screen.  Ingenious.  Sorry there wasn't the Edge's guitar effect from 1983's War album, but he just couldn't fit it in around all that soul, so he settles for cascading it down like icicles.<br /><br />3)Numb---The Edge shines with a blistering industrial GUITAR sound as he pays homage to \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" with his spoken word rap about conformity.<br /><br />4)Lemon---The musical highlight of the album.  Adam and Larrys' rhythm section is amazingly groovy, and Bono sings in his falsetto about \\"slowly slipping under\\" and \\"holding onto nothing\\".  Edge replaces a guitar that would be out of place with a keyboard that fits perfectly.<br /><br />5)Stay---Beautiful ballad, one of the best U2 has ever done.<br /><br />6)Daddy's Gonna Pay---This is to Zooropa what \\"The Fly\\" was to AB. U2 rips apart their fabric with a song where the GUITAR slams you sonically and the Drums and bass are extremely compact.<br /><br />7)Some Days---A little R and B number from the boys that merges several sounds they haven't used before.  Adam's bass line propels this song.<br /><br />8)The First Time---A haunting number in the vein of \\"Running to Stand Still\\" with a beautiful piano melody.<br /><br />9)Dirty Day---Another beautful song, driven by haunting keyboards, until the end when Edge's GUITAR takes it into the stratosphere.<br /><br />10)The Wanderer---Anybody care to f*** with Johnny Cash? Didn't think so.pa what \\"The Fly\\" was to AB.

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|may i start off by saying that i love system but Daron really needs to stop singing lead. not saying that he is a great guitarist and back up but his voice is very annoying if thats all ur hearing.  there are some high points on this cd though like questions and violent pornography that give me hope for the future hopelfull they can get Daron under control and get back on track. if u like the singles from this cd u will be blown away by toxicity and self titled
B000001DTM|5.0|This is a difficult album for me to review, because it is one of those albums that is deeply personal. But without going TOO deeply into my history, let's just say that AB and Zooropa still resonate with me to this day.  My wife has two tattoos directly related to Achtung Baby.  Powerful.  So why does this album hold up so strongly?  Flashback.....<br /><br />I remember sitting in my living room, having almost forgotten about U2 entirely.  Back in my senior year of high school, the open plains and pains of the Joshua Tree and the clatter and clang of Rattle and Hum provided two of many soundtrack albums that year.  My friends and I would sing \\"Desire\\" \\"God Part II\\" \\"WOWY\\" \\"BTBS\\" etc etc to infinity.  But as the decade 1990 opened, U2 had famously went into hibernation to \\"dream it all up again\\".<br /><br />But back to my living room.  MTV had still dedicated itself at least half the time to showing music videos, and I remember looking up from a book hearing a muffled drum beat and some cheesy keyboards backing up what sounded like a gospel singer.  All the more unsettling was seeing what looked like Jim Morrison in bug-eyed shades harassing people in London.  When the lower-left corner scrawl read \\"U2---The Fly---Achtung Baby\\" I just had time to do a comical double take before the Edge lowered the boom. For the next 3 1/2 minutes I sat in rapture.  Bono had clearly reinvented himself as a rock showman/shaman/actor, but it was the Edge who had catapulted U2 into the stratosphere.  Blistering chunks of funk dripped off of his guitar like molten lava.  And when the solo kicked in? Unbelievable.  This was not the same band.  Couldn't be. When I got AB (on cassette!) it floored me. \\"Zoo Station\\" cranked the album into overdrive; \\"Real Thing\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" moved your ass; \\"Light My Way\\" and \\"Acrobat\\" sounded like helicopters landing on your skull; \\"So Cruel\\" \\"One\\" and \\"Love is Blindness\\" were the most tender of ballads without sounding sappy. Larry and Adam, more so than ever, provided this album with its drivetrain.  Bono's lyrics were at once throwaway and cut to the bone, all the while maintaining a serious urgency.<br /><br />If you do not have this album, get it now. I have gone through one cassette and 3 cd's. Also recommended: ZOO TV Live in Sydney on VHS.ore so than ever, provided this album with its drivetrain.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|may i start off by saying i love system but this is really like a 3.5. the first time i listened to Toxicity and the self titled i had to listen to it 5 more times, i was hooked.  with the past two albums i was very disappointed namely because of the lack of Serj's vocals and too much Daron.  Daron was a great back up singer and at some points great with harmonies on past albums but on hyp/mez he decieded that he wanted to be the main singer insted of Serj. The only probelm with this is Daron doesnt have the voice to sing lead (its too whiny).  After saying that their are some great songs on this cd like Vincinty of obsenity which showed that there still is hope for System and they still have the crazyness that they showed back in the songs such as sugar and bounce.  I hope that they can pull it back together and Serj will have the guts to tell Daron he cant sing lead.
B000000OQY|5.0|After the unbelievable phenomenon that was AFD, GNR came straight out of left field with this album that was actually 2 EP's in one.  The first side, 4 songs culled from mid-80's live performances off an EP titled Live Like a Suicide, is the perfect precursor to AFD.  \\"Reckless Life\\" and \\"Nice Boys\\", in particular, slam you from the get-go.<br /><br />The second side, and the most controversial , could be titled GNR Unplugged, as the boys ditch the electrics for acoustics on 3 new songs. \\"Patience\\" is a sweet and soft ballad, maybe even the slow counterpart to \\"Think about You\\" lyrically. Then the subject matter opens up several cans of worms at once. \\"Used to Love Her\\", performed as a jangly folkish rave-up, includes the incendiary line \\"I used to love her/But I had to kill her.\\" Obviously, there really isn't anything funny about killing your lover and putting her \\"six feet under.\\" But in the context of many rap albums that came out since then, it seems almost tame.  NWA took the line that GNR drew in the sand and destroyed it, with songs such as \\"To Kill a Hooker\\" and \\"One Less B****.\\" (Note: NWA became one of Axl's fave groups after that). Even Hendrix's cover of \\"Hey Joe\\" touches on this material as well.  There obviously is a thin line between \\"gritty storyteller\\" and \\"misogynist\\". as Axl says in the song, \\"Take it for what it is.\\"<br /><br />The album then moves to GNR covering itself, but with a twist.  They take \\"You're Crazy\\", originally a fevered punkish romp of paranoia on AFD, and give it some slow acoustic funk on Lies.  This version sounds almost like a plea rather than a rant, and it works wonderfully. You wonder what \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" or \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" would sound like if they had given those songs the same treatment.<br /><br />And now to the flashpoint finale, \\"One in a Million,\\" a six-minute power ballad that name-checks \\"Police and n*****rs\\" and \\"immigrants and f****ts\\" (no, not fascists) on its way to describing the new world of L.A. through the eyes of a Midwestern immigrant fresh off a Greyhound, Axl himself.  Again, gritty storyteller or vicious fascist? Has Axl changed the way he sees the world since then? Only he can answer that.  But he shouldn't have to.  Has Ice Cube changed his opinion of Korean shop owners or white devils? He shouldn't have to answer that.  Art is art for arts sake.<br /><br />Great second record.L.A. through the eyes of a Midwestern immigrant fresh off a Greyhound, Axl himself.  Again, gritty storyteller or vicious fascist?

B00007E8V4|5.0|This cd which was put out as an almost outakes cd of toxicity is easily almost as good as toxicity itself.  The erie (srry i cant spell for my life) chants of I-E-A-I-A-I-O are just as good as the lows and highs of Chop Suey and the slow quiet parts of Mr Jack are as good as any Toxicity or Aerials.  Not saying that there are some skipable songs on the cd but i mean it is a outtakes cd.  If u enjoy byob and hypnotize ur going to be blown away by this (might i add that im very dissapointed in Mez/Hyp) and be listening to it constintly
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I sort of wish I had got the Double Disc edition, but what I did get in the single disc edition was and is so magical, I can honestly say I am more than happy with it. <br />The sound is totally beautiful; if you have a theatre sound system at home, this will be a beautiful watch. Every moment is a precious journey into the heart of a world of \\"Believe\\". Tom Hanks and Bob Zemickis must be commended for their roles, and their young actors who voiced that beautiful song done at the end of the train must be commended for such a heart rending performance. <br />The biggest and best step with this journey is decided to get on the train: its a wonderful, beautiful, and sublime experience. <br />
B000002H97|5.0|This Cd marked the end of the great Mettallica(after this the made more very bad abulms and lost their roots in hard rock).  This cd was definitly not the best of metallica but was a wonderfulyy cd nevertheless.  In this cd Metallica traded in their long marathons of songs for shorter slighltly softer verisons.  This was not a horrible thing but changed them in a way and they never were the same.  If u dont own this cd seriously think about getting it and enjoying the end of the Metallica reign.
B00005JO1G|4.0|Well... the story is as old as time.  Kids sign up, train, and go to war.  Other stories have probably better described the process than this one.  However, what Jarheads does is show how our society has changed, perception of those going to war has changed, war itself has changed.... change ad naseum!!  Except for the Staff Sergeant... and may God Bless him, for he is the reason the others come back alive!!  I was depressed by the lack of understanding the warriors in this film had about their role.  If that was a point of the movie , and I hope it was, I wish the logic had been fleshed out a bit more. <br /> <br />Why I gave this film four stars is the cinematography.  The pictures are every bit as stark and imposing as the real thing.  Any deer hunter or sniper out there can relate to the view through Swofford's scope.  The desert scenes and the scenes under the oil wells made the hair on the back of my neck stand up!  I would recommend this film for the beauty of the pictures alone!! They do justice to what actually happened over there. <br /> <br />Bottom line - the moral message of the movie might be a little shaky, but the film is entertaining and the cinematography is more than worth the price of admission.  A definite should see! <br /> <br />

6305537321|4.0|The early 1960s were a sophisticated time (as opposed to our meaner and more jaded times of today), which was reflected in many of the movies that were made then. The center of life and thought seemed to be in the cities, and the city mouse was king. Many movies tried to capture this (THE APARTMENT, A MAN AND A WOMAN, come immediately to mind), as did this movie as well.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly, a Manhattan latcher-on-to-rich-men coquette (one hesitates to say call girl because sex seems absent), and George Peppard is her neighbor, a writer who's a \\"kept\\" man himself. The movie is about their gradually falling in love, though Hepburn continues to look for that rich man who will give her the life of luxury she craves. After trials and tribulations, they end up together.<br /><br />Hepburn is too light and \\"innocent\\" in her role - one expects more of a wordly-wise, rougher-around-the-edges character to be Holly. And the picture as a whole is all too neat and worked out: it goes on too long getting to the resolution we knew was going to take place almost from the start. The final scene in the rain is a classic though, borrowed many times in other movies (for example, THE GOODBYE GIRL). Peppard is very good, too: he's very subdued with just the right feel. And that sophistication I talked about earlier is always present. Of course there's MOON RIVER, too. Not a bad movie - worth a watch.
B000007T1M|5.0|This cd just compeltly blew me away from start to finish.  With songs such as Sugar and Suite-Pee System shows crazyness while still haveing smart lyrics.  Songs such as Spiders show that System also has a soft side which doesnt sound forced. The song Pluck shows anrgy and fire that fuels alot of there songs.  All in all this cd is perfect in every way and is highly underestimated.
B00004YRQA|4.0|This memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced. I didn't have to worry about this because mine came with my PS2. It can hold about 40 files, thats about 1 file for each game. If you have over 40 games, like me, you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards. If you buy two of the black ones, it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused. The value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|As a long time Enya fan (starting with the ground breaking album Watermark), I found Amarantine to be a let down, as there is nothing new here that has not been heard before on her previous albums.  In Amaratine it appears that Enya has finally run out of new concepts.  After a long break from her last album, I was anxiously looking forward to new material along the lines of Shepard Moons or The Memory of Trees.  Watch out for what you wish for, as that is what we got.  This in no way diminishes the work Enya has produced to date as I still enjoy her previous albums, I simply wish that Amarantine had continued the tradition of unique surprises.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|the song 'beautiful' is what got me to listen to the rest of this album.  the first two times through, it was still growing on me, but i continued to listen to it.  the third time through, i knew i was in love.  yesterday i listened to it eight times!  james has an amazing ability to make you feel emotionally attached to his music.  this one's gonna be at the top of my list for a long time.
0553801503|3.0|We all know the phrase \\"sometimes the journey is the destination\\".  But sometimes too the journey is just that, the journey.  And that's the problem with Feast for Crows--too much journeying, not enough destinations.  As has been greatly discussed, Martin found he had \\"too much\\" for one book so lopped off half the characters and divided it into two books. Clearly that was an overly simple reaction and a mistake as that left him with a lot of characters but too little story for Feast. <br />  We're missing many of the best characters here and that lack of balance was a noticeable drag on the book. Another drag was the lack of editing.  Realizing you have too much material doesn't necessarily mean all you need to do is publish it successively. Instead, paring some of the material might have helped.  Here there is too much repetitive action, too much unnecessary description (of clothing, heraldry, genealogies, nipples (yes nipples, lots of 'em in this book, and the book's pace is noticeably slower than previous ones.  Some scenes seemed merely perfunctory, as if they were previous plot points to be checked off as \\"resolved\\" or plot points to be checked off as \\"future events to unfold further\\".  Lots of characters move from place to place, but there is little of interest in the trips themselves and one too often has to wait for another book to see if there is anything of interest once they arrive. Stylistically, Martin is as strong as ever, but style needs to be married to something else and here it is not. Feast isn't a bad book--it moves slowly but move it does, there are no jarring plot contrivances, dialogue is generally strong--so it isn't a bad book.  But it isn't a consequential book. Or a compelling one.  The first three books I'm happy to reread in preparation for another as they are more than good and stand up to multiple readings.  But Feast is the sort of book where looking up a summary on a website will do you fine--it will tell you what you need to knowand with about as much interest or passion as the book itself had.  Recommended so fans of the series know what happens and can pick up with the next one, but with fair warning that this is if not a severe drop-off in quality certainly a painful one.  Here's hoping the next one returns to the quality of the first three. <br />
B00005JNJV|5.0|You already know what this movie is about. The question is- is it any good? The answer is yes, this is a great movie on all fronts- action, plot, meaning, acting, effects. I was entranced by all of it. This is how movies these days should be made.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|I'm in the minority in the states, in that I'm a huge fan of Robbie Williams.  He doesn't disappoint with his new record.  It's full of great pop music and is my favorite album of 2005.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Nope, I do not like this music.  <br /> <br />Madonna is also the better selling female out of the two (for more info check my Madonna - Confessions On A Dance Floor review). <br /> <br />This...This is just plain bad, really.

B000BM6AVA|4.0|I personally liked Mesmerize better, but this isn't a bad album. Some have put down Daron's vocals, but some of my favorite parts of this album (ditto with Mesmerize) are the harmonies by Daron and Serj. <br /> <br />Attack: A fast-paced, powerful intro.  <br />Dreaming: Love the 2-voices going at once, and as usual, I absolutely love Daron + Serj's harmonies in the chorus. <br />Kill Rock 'N Roll: Again, love the harmonies. Catchy, I like this one a lot. Love the \\"Eat all the grass/Accidents happen\\" bit. <br />Hypnotize: When I first heard this released as a single I was kind of disappointed compared to the stuff off Mesmorize, but after hearing it a few more times, it's grown on my a little more. Starts as a much lighter song compared to the previous 3, then progresses a bit. <br />Stealing Society: Eh, not too crazy about this one. <br />Tentative: Not too crazy about this one, like it more than Stealing Society though. <br />U-Fig: This one's pretty cool, love the chorus (beatitbeatitbeatitbeatitbeatitbeatit!). <br />Holy Mountains: When I first heard this one, I really didn't like it and the vitriolic screaming. After looking over the lyrics and hearing it a few more times, like Hypnotize, it's kind of grown on me. Very strong. <br />Vicinity of Obscenity: Bizzare, one of my favorite songs on the album. <br />She's Like Heroin: Another kind of odd one, I like it though. <br />Lonely Day: Er...pretty corny, in my opinion. <br />Solider Side: Extremely emotional reprise of the intro of Mesmerize, I was close to tears from this one. Well done.
0767827791|4.0|A previous reviewer was disappointed with the pan and scan version of this disc. The widescreen version is on the flip side, though! Aside from that, the picture quality is less than ideal, but better than many I've seen from the period. Some scenes really look great, and outnumber the truly problematic ones--notably when Madge and Hal are down by the river after the picnic and an apparent bad dupe is cut in for a while. The music sound quality is pretty good with nice stereo separation. <br /> <br />Picnic is one of a handful of movies that I return to time and again. It does have its faults-- some of the dramatics among Madge, Flo and Millie seem pretty creaky today-- but the movie does an incredible job of creating just the right atmosphere. <br /> <br />Novak and Holden manage to create great chemistry despite there being little rapport between them while filming (as discussed in a biography of Holden, \\"Golden Boy.\\") Holden always brings a gold touch to any movie. The characters seem to really live in that world. I wouldn't want to live in that small town depicted onscreen, but wish I could visit whenever I want.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|It's been a while since we've heard anything this blatantly palatable from the world's most narcissistic Queen of Clubs.  If Dick Clark was still hosting Rate-A-Record, I'd have to say that \\"it has a good beat and you can dance to it\\".  The only duds for me were Forbidden Love and Jump.  Madge is still in desperate need of a good lyricist, but, hey, how often does anyone really listen to lyrics for substance anyway?  I'm glad to see that her kids and Kaballah haven't totally squashed her groove thang.
B000069HJN|5.0|This is a fantastic disc. Sonically, it ranks up there with Floyd and Parsons. Coincidentally, David Gilmour makes an appearance on electric guitar - and what an appearance! Sorry, no roger from here on out, but for this disc (the first one w/out RH) anyway, he wasn't missed. Brother where you Bound (the song) is 16 minutes long and is an incredible example of truly progressive music. Especially considering the AOR infested period that this music was created during(1985).
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions On A Dance Floor is an amazing album. All killer, no filler! Also, I just looked up this information from Wikipedia. It's an account of Madonna's worldwide sales: <br /> <br />(1983) Madonna -- 10.0 million  <br />(1984) Like A Virgin -- 20.5 million <br />(1986) True Blue -- 23.4 million <br />(1987) You Can Dance -- 7.0 million <br />(1989) Like A Prayer -- 15.0 million <br />(1990) I'm Breathless -- 8.0 million <br />(1990) The Immaculate Collection -- 26.5 million <br />(1992) Erotica -- 6.3 million <br />(1994) Bedtime Stories -- 7.5 million <br />(1995) Something To Remember -- 13.6 million <br />(1996) Evita -- 19.2 million <br />(1998) Ray Of Light -- 18.0 million <br />(2000) Music -- 16.0 million <br />(2001) GHV2 -- 8.5 million <br />(2003) American Life -- 5.5 million <br />(2003) Remixed And Revisited -- 2.0 million <br />(2005) Confessions On A Dance Floor -- 4.2 million <br />(Somehow, I don't think Mariah's new album sold that much worldwide in its first 10 days.) <br /> <br />Oh, I also came accross this best-selling artist thing. It said Madonna was #4 and Mariah was #7. So there's your proof. Madonna is a better-selling artist. Now we can all stop behaving like children (TeamLamb and the Madonna haters), and start acting like proper grown people. What do you say, eh?
1400049628|5.0|This book is a very cleverly written parody of your typical survival manual.  Max Brooks does use some sarcasm, but not too much that is overt humor.  The humor mainly comes from the ridiculous amount of detail and the fact that he never lets you in on the joke.  For example, each attack group should carry such items as \\"two grappling hooks, 500 feet of rope (nylon construction, 7/16\\" diameter, tensile strength 6.500 lbs., load absorption 1,450 ft./lb.), and a tool kit (which includes examples of five different types of screwdrivers).  Another fun bit is the zombie virus, which he calls \\"Solanum\\".  Turns out, solanum does actually exist, but it only infects potatoes.  All in all, this is an excellent example of parody and it is actually a very interesting read.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|First full SOAD album I heard at the beginning of the Summer, and I've listened to it countless times since then. The melodies parallel with Daron + Serj's quote \\"discordant harmonies\\" have hooked me, making this album one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Solider Side: Quoting others, it's a short and eerie intro. It continues at the end of Hypnotize, in a deep emotional reprise. <br />B.Y.O.B: A quick-paced, energetic thrash about the war, a nice transition effect after Solider Side. <br />Revenga: An interesting song, one of my favorites. <br />Radio/Video: My favorite in the album, featuring two-direction harmonies between Daron and Serj and an interesting feel throughout the song. <br />Cigaro: Bizarre, fast, funny. <br />This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song: Another bizarre song, differs greatly from Cigaro, very catchy. <br />Violent Pornography: An amusing look upon things, great to sing along to. <br />Question: Slightly lighter than the previous songs at the beginning, and progresses. This song took some time to grow on me. <br />Sad Statue: Another political song, starts with a quick guitar riff and jumps into quick drums, and eventually vocals. I like this one a lot. <br />Old School Hollywood: Electronic-ish meets metal, interesting, a favorite. <br />Lost in Hollywood: Mostly Daron singing, easily the lightest song on the album, not bad but a little odd compared to the rest of the album.
0131479415|5.0|The book is well structured and easy to read.  In my humble opinion, it comes with a strong \\"buy\\" rating for any Agile practitioner or a current PMI certified person who wants to contribute to the knowledge economy of ever changing requirements. The book is right sized (finish in a coast to coast trip in US). Practical in its content, it provides lots of examples and case studies, from software as well as non software fields to illustrate the concepts. The detailed case study at the end of the book is invaluable.<br /><br />Several chapters were much thought provoking, specially how to handle team dynamics and cross team estimation.  The book did not right fully delve into any details of that, it's a topic for another time.<br /><br />Part I of the books sets up the context.<br /><br />Part II details on estimating the size, and the techniques and tools for doing that; in fact it comes with some simple tools, which can be really customized and expanded quickly.<br /><br />Part III caters to what I call \\"value add planning\\" planning the work by prioritizing by business value,  The books touches the concepts of financial project analysis, however there are better books for that, and the author provides the references.<br /><br />Part IV brings in the concept of time, and the handling of \\"estimating for effort\\" and estimating for duration\\" is simply superb.  Also an entire chapter is dedicated to Buffering and its need and for multi-team projects.<br /><br />Part V presents tools and motivations for monitoring and communicating.<br /><br />Part VI presents why Agile Planning works, and honestly I skipped it, expect the guidelines ( Page 254) which I read to validate my knowledge.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I would change in the book, it would be the story point example with dogs.  It would be a little confusing if you have no idea how a Great Dane would be different from a Duchshund!  But hey, I think the book gets the message across very well.<br /><br />What I would like to see in the second edition-- softcopy of some tools that goes with the book, may be some templates that can be customized...but then again, you should not be in this business unless you are able to cook these tools up yourself !!- softcopy of some tools that goes with the book, may be some templates that can be customized...but then again, you should not be in this business unless you are able to cook these tools up yourself !! <br />
B00000DLUV|5.0|I bought this CD with a U2 DVD concert. I was expecting the U2 concert to blow away the Bee Gees but it was the Bee Gees who blew away the U2 concert.  <br /> <br />I did not realize how many good lesser known songs the Bee Gees have. The non disco songs are excellent. For example, songs like Alone, Words, Closer Than Close are great songs and I never heard them before. The vocals of the group are fantastic and the setlist is top notch. You can tell these guys are pros and special when compared to the sub par junk music that is released these days. <br /> <br />I was not a Bee Gee's fan before this CD but I can say they proved to me they are one of the greatest groups of all time. <br />They earned my respect with this CD.
B000069HJL|5.0|There's a reason why every review of this disc gives it 5 stars. Because it is truly an example of a classic live document from one of rock's more creative groups - Supertramp. The song selection as well as placement AND execution, makes this one a no-brainer. no. You know what makes this one a no-brainer? It is a great LIVE disc. So often I hear a live disc and i'm turned off because the 'magic' somehow eludes the live reproduction. This is definitely not the case with Paris. Top of the shelf walk down memory lane, when Roger Hodgson still graced the stage with supertramp.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Enya comes back after a five year-long musical hiatus with an album that surpasses the quality and depth of \\"A Day Without Rain\\" and one that results a tad less commercial than it. However, it's not without formulas. It goes back to the tried-and-true Enya blend of Celtic and New Age that she has continued to refine since her \\"Orinoco Flow\\" days, yet one that most of us continue to enjoy.<br /><br />This time around, she has departed from her previous work in one respect: three of the tracks are sung in Loxian, an imaginary Elvish-like language created by her longtime lyrical partner, Roma Ryan. The overall result in the album sticks with you and is bound to make of \\"Amarantine\\" as big a success as its predecessor was. Still, I am going to give it 4.5 (and not 5) stars, since it still lacks innovation.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This is an improvement from her downer American Life.  Uniquely executed as a dance track [all 11 of them], but in my own opinion it can never fulfill the energy of her most popular Ray of Light and the popcorn dazzleness of Music (of which fell in favor of her self-indulged American Life).  What's more, it feels so rushed and not a complete dance music - more or less the same atmosphere as in Music. <br /> <br />'Hung Up' is the get-up-and-dance hit which is well overplayed, but again an improvement.  I trully think that 'Get Together' should be the next single to complement her first one and not 'Sorry'.  'Get Together' is all trance and highly seductive, yet 'Sorry' is just okay, but wouldn't do the album justice as a single.  All the others ['Future Lovers', 'I Love New York' {Cool turn-around dance tune, but the lyrics can use a good polishing}, 'Forbidden Love', 'Jump', 'How High', 'Isaac', 'Push' and 'Like It Or Not'] are good on one hand and totally slopes down on the other.  I won't knock her straight down, though she does have that singing voice and 'can' come up with some innovative stuff. <br /> <br />Gone are the 70's disco and 80's music charm, but granted she's breathing back some life to it.  Too I can't give her 4 and a half because, after all, she deserves it!
B000BBOUU4|4.0|This movie was hilarious.  I love the original, but who can resist Johnny Depp? He made a perfectly creepy Willie Wonka and did justice to the roll.  My 6 year old laughed and laughed at this movie.  I'm afraid to show her the original for fear that she'd be disappointed!
B0000DIJO2|5.0|I was not a Bee Gee fan but I thought I would buy something different and I saw a snippet of this show on PBS so I gave it a try.  <br /> <br />I knew of the Bee Gees of course but only the 70's dance hits which were good but not really my favorite type of music. So I was not expecting too much from this concert. But I learned a lot about the Bee Gees from this concert. They have many great songs that are not well known. For instance, songs like Words, Island In the Stream, Massachusetts, Alone, Closer Than Close , and I Started A Joke are really great slower songs from their hits. Of course, their dance hits are good too but for me the  <br />lesser known songs are what made this CD worth getting. <br /> <br />The performance of the group is really tight and the vocals are extraordinary. I would recommend this CD if you want to take a break and listen to some good live soft rock songs. Good Stuff!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Once again, Peter Jackson does the impossible by essentially pulling off a movie that has no legitimate beginning or ending! He pulls it off with such ease and magnificence (I must add) that nobody really pays attention to the fact that these movies were and are the grandest moments in the history of film. Things were dreamed and accomplished that would have seemed ridiculous to most film directors. PJ once again takes the viewer directly INTO middle earth. I mean, i've read the books at least 15 times in my life, and the one thing that strikes me most about these movies is the complete fidelity to Tolkien's vision of Middle earth. True, the plot has been tweaked, but the essential elements of the story are still there. PJ's downright Puritanical fidelity to the author's vision of this world makes these movies so enjoyable that a tweak here or there in storyline is more than bearable. Buy all of these movies, make 12 tubs of popcorn, and enjoy!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I guess movie promotion is a science in itself.  You'd think Universal would have learned the lessons of how this series failed on TV.  Joss is a great storyteller and script writer, but this is twice he's had some marginal clout, and not acted in the interest of his product.  You can't just get caught up in the dreams of the fanbase.  They are by definition, fanatics, it does not always translate into ticket sales.  Now, lets get onto the movie review. <br /> <br />First, we need a bit of needed background information for non-fans of the series.  This movie is based on the short-lived, but fantastic tv show, Firefly.  Created by Joss Whedon, of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" fame.  He was looking to create a post American civil war type of story, moving the setting into futuristic space.  Sometimes described as a western in space show, it's really a fairly logical speculation on how man would begin to settle, and terra form other planets.  Joss does not believe in \\"little green men\\" so there are no alien types in his universe, that in itself is  one of the more unique elements, which serve make the series, and movie, something special. <br /> <br />I'd heard some disturbing things initially on how they were gonna make this movie. It sounded like they were gonna redo the pilot, so as not to lose viewers who hadn't seen the series.  I think they chose wisely for fans of the series. Unfortunately, I can't help but think they maybe needed a little beginning film narrative.  Perhaps few flashbacks, to bring non-series viewers up to speed. The story line here begins after the series plot arc, and sometime beyond.  Two former crew members (sort of) are staying off ship, each with their own reasons. <br /> <br />Joss Whedon must have reviewed the episodes in Firefly, and thought he had a good villain type from the episode \\"Objects in Space\\".  I really think the main \\"bad guy\\" in this one was based on the character \\"Early\\", who matched wits with River, and lost in one of the last episodes shown on TV. Some of the implied violence, killings done by the Alliance, and its chosen henchman, killer, was a bit over the top.  It didn't ring true, because it was not justified.  I think Joss could have done better.  He was looking at a cerebral type of assassin, I don't think mass murder would be \\"his\\" solution.  Some of the most \\"scary\\" characters from the series were the black suited men that came after River in the hospital robbery episode.  I think the reprise of those guys, would have had a greater impact to the story. <br /> <br />Joss brought a little of Buffy in this movie to the character, River Tam.  Buffy fans, watch for a classic weapon pose, stare, at the end of a long fight scene, which occurs late in the movie. The film has taken some heat over the elimination of some main characters.  This is science fiction, so is anyone really ever dead.  If they need them back there are a number of ways to do it, and I think the deaths were necessary to the story line.  If not for death number one, it would be hard to personalize the killings in the name of finding River.  Later death(s) were abrupt, maybe too much so for fans, but it helped give a sense of reality to the final battles. (Possible Spoiler next) <br /> <br />At one point it looked as if any or all of the main cast could die, something that rarely happens in an ensemble cast. You really had the suspicion that Joss might just have believed this movie was a one shot deal, and was going to move on to bigger, better projects! I do like the fact that they got all of the cast involved, in an all too short movie.  This resolved, or at least partially resolved a lot of the loose ends in the series. <br /> <br />As a stand alone Science Fiction action movie, with good dialog, story, and action. Its hard to believe this movie didn't manage to pick up some momentum in the theaters. I can only speculate the movie just didn't appeal to movie audiences on some level.  The title may have hurt it,almost as much as the lack of promotion.  Going in a movie like this coming out well after Star Wars III, and War of the Worlds, then six weeks ahead of the latest Harry Potter should have had the movie ticket buyers largely to itself.  It didn't happen. <br /> <br />I can't speak for the DVD yet, but I'd buy the wide-screen version, there are many scenes that would lose something without it.  I believe fans will buy this DVD in droves, but if you are a movie fan of good story, good dialog, and even good action, you should buy this film.  In a different time with the right kind of promotion, this film could have launched a new space genre much like Trek or Star Wars.  It is unfair to compare them head to head, but in a lot of ways this is just as good, and often better. <br /> <br />
B000003TAW|5.0|I must say that this CD is a milestone in my taste's in music! I wasn't really sure of what sort of music to like when I was younger. I listened to whatever my friends burned for me and there were a few bands I knew I liked, but I wasn't sure how to find new bands or what \\"genres\\" were or which ones I liked. I was meaning to borrow this CD from a good friend of mine for a long time and I was a little surprised when I finally heard this CD. It took a few listenings to get used to but this CD and Weezer as a band totally changed my outlook on music. I was listening to garbageo like Linkin Park only beacuase my friend liked them and wanted me to. The Blue Album really opened up the world of music to me and it is the point in my life where I really loved and appreciated all sorts of music out there. I first heard Weezer's \\"Blue Album\\" about 2 and a half years ago and they still remain to this day one of my all time favorite bands. There's some sort of magic behind their music and this CD especially that you can't help but love. Original lyrics, guitars that are catchy as all get out, bass that is delicious, drumlines that are original. Blue Album is like the ultimate \\"garage band\\" feeling that we all know and love. It's like the band we love in our own hometown and shows that we can sincerely believe in such underdogs that truly are rock gods and awesome deep down! Buy this CD, the average rating of 5 stars amoung so many reviewers is a sign people!  <br />Peace, <br />Ty
B0002IQHY8|1.0|The instrumentals are terrible.  The remake of Mammagamma sounds like the macarena gone very wrong (listen to it closely!  You'll agree!) <br /> <br />Chomolungma is just repetitive crap.  <br /> <br />The songs with lyrics are awful too. <br /> <br />I can truly say that Alan Parsons is nothing without good musicians and good musicianship around him.   This complete piece of trash is all drivel. <br />

B000BJS4SU|3.0|I like tracks 2, 4, and 5, the rest I don't care for. Raw honkytonk/blues/jazz/whatever is not what I want to hear from John Mayer. It seems like this is just a self-indulgent thing thrown together for kicks, which I guess is what live albums are supposed to be, but since they're mostly new songs I expected something more. It's been suggested that his last two albums weren't where his passion was, but if he really had this music in him the whole time I can't believe he would have held it back for so long. I guess it's possible that this is an artistic evolution he's been working towards, but I expect and hope that \\"raw blues guy\\" will prove to be just a character he plays on weekends, a minor diversion from his true calling, as a master craftsman of harmonic, melodic, catchy pop songs.  <br />
B00006F7IM|4.0|The Cleveland Indians haven't been doing very well for years. When the owner of the team dies, and leaves the team to his wife she decides that she wants to move the team to Florida. However she can only move the team to Florida if they continue to do poorly. So she sets out to put together a team of misfits, that she hopes will come in dead last in the baseball season. <br /> <br /> So you've got Tom Berenger's character who had been playing in the Mexican league and has bad knees, Corbin Bernsen as the pretty boy rich guy who won't take dives for the ball. Ex-con Rick \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn the man with the fast pitch who can't control the ball. There's also Willie Mays Hayes, he can run like the wind, and steal the bases, but he can't hit the ball. <br /> <br /> Major League is a hilarious comedy about baseball team assembled to lose, but once they find out that they owner wanted them to lose they all learn how to play, and come out on top. <br /> <br />
B00005JO17|1.0|What a stupid movie. This chicken thinks the sky is going to fall and lies. Then he goes to a baseball game then the sky seriously falls. That doesn't make any sense to me. The chicken should've gotten arrested for that. And would someone please at McDonald's take down that Chicken Little poster thing it creeps me out. Umm...don't see this movie it's dumb and pointless.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This CD is so great- Michael Buble is so talented- I'm so glad this is the kind of music he has chosen to make.  Feeling Good is a great, sexy song and he sings it like he's lived it. You Don't Know Me is done beautifully...there isn't a bad song on this CD!  I can listen from start to finish and I love all the songs on here- a must-have for any Buble fan or anyone who loves this music!
B0009I7NNA|2.0|Before they used to growl and now they make radio freindly pop metal. That tell's you that this bands lacks an identity and will sell out to anything. Bat Country is one of the few songs in this album that sounds somewhat good but, it appears to be a fluke since everything else in this album sucks.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I've had this album for about 10 minutes and I've decided that I DON'T LIKE IT, because I am a f**king CLOWN!!! <br /> <br /> <br />You people are idiots; at least have the album for a week before writing a review. It's not fair to NORMAL people who read your reviews. The band pours hundreds of hours into this capitalistic venture and you listen to it for less than one hour and decide in all fickle western insanity that you don't like it. <br /> <br />Kenny Amazon, I'm hereby asking you to institute a rule where the album can't be reviewed until a week after it comes out. You may as well have people who've never listened to it reviewing it. <br /> <br />Personally, I really liked the album, because it is GOOD. I'm not going to give each song a score out of ten because it is an ALBUM, not a collection of stand-alone songs... each song compliments the other, taking and giving... much like the big boys at SONY when they decided to release one album as 2 seperate albums with fancy covers so people wouldn't try to pirate it... but they're mostly taking. <br /> <br />The original album was \\"System of a Down: Capitalize\\" <br />Music domineering at its worst. <br /> <br />And for the record (i know someone out there is keeping one), I bought a real copy of the first album, then I PIRATED the second one as an active protest against music industry TYRANNY! <br /> <br />DOWN WITH THE SYSTEM! <br /> <br />

B000BFH2S2|5.0|Wow...this CD/DVD is completely amazing!  I haven't had a chance to see him live (yet) and this is a great way to see him on stage.  He has a great stage presence- he's funny, charming, and incredibly talented.  I love how he involves the audience in his show....he's awesome in all ways of the word.
0792107683|1.0|I'd managed to get through 45 years of American life without exposure to this, always avoiding cowboy mythology movies. Then, while waiting to see \\"Distant\\", a really great recent Turkish film I would strongly recommend, I had to listen to the last couple of minutes of \\"Shane\\". Two whole minutes of that kid yelling all kinds of pathetic stuff, punctuated now and again by the yelp \\"Shane!\\". What Shane was doing, riding off into the sunset, riding over a cliff, being strangled by the bad guys, I couldn't tell you.  <br />Compare it to the final scene of \\"i Vitteloni\\" by Fellini, in which the protagonist is seen off by a boy he'd befriended when he leaves the provincial town for Rome; it's a great indicator of the gulf between real cinema and the pornographic rubbish that Hollywood churns out.
B0002S94OS|1.0|I know that the title of this review alone will get any fan of this album going ballistic, but I felt it only fair to take some somewhat cheap shots at the metalheads and others out there who attack other musical styles that they don't like. First, let me say that I am a fan of metal and I will readily agree that this band and lots of others are bionic musicians, but seriously, how can you criticize ANY other style of music's vocalists (Ashlee, Britney, opera singers, country, etc...) and defend this garbage that you call vocals that are a part of today's metal??? Anyone and I mean ANYONE could sing(?) this junk !!! The lyrics might have some substance, but since I can't understand a word he's saying, (notice, I didn't say \\"singing\\"), again I have to say, my dog is a better vocalist !!! Now yes, I'm an old man, (43), and I like Ozzy's voice and all, and to you that's not REAL metal, but that's not my point, which is, if you don't like a style of music, that doesn't automatically mean that it sucks and takes no skill to produce. Like I said earlier, I like metal and am a guitarist myself who absolutely loves the music of metal. I mean ,God bless detuned 7 string guitars and double kick drums, but being maybe a little bit more mature and realizing that I didn't really know everything at the age of 15, I've come to<br /><br />appreciate the fact that people have a right to like whatever they want and I challenge any of your gifted metal musicians (and I seriously mean that, those guys are talented), to pick up a violin or sit down at a piano and take a crack at some Beethoven and then tell me that it takes no skill !!!<br /><br />So grow up children, maybe someday you'll see you're not right about everything and the world doesn't revolve around you and your petty little world.(you know, if some of your metal bands<br /><br />would have a lead vocalist like Ashlee Simpson, they might actually sell a few albums and get a record deal and someone besides you would know they even exist and could hear them and maybe start to appreciate the talent involved in playing hardcore metal,but that's probably too much of a concept for your narrow-minded little brains to accept !!! Someday, you'll figure out that it's the middle of the road, mindless masses that actually run the show and that none of us is better or worse than the other. Alright, you can all go back to hating the world because nobody can tell you what to do because you already know it all anyway. Get something pierced or whatever, that'll show them !!! Anyway, have a nice day, I know I will !!!d could hear them and maybe start to appreciate the talent involved in playing hardcore metal,but that's probably too much of a concept for your narrow-minded little brains to accept !!!

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna's created one heck of a dance album here along with fabulous dance meister Stuart Price. In my books, it's down as the best dance album of the year by far.
1593553307|5.0|Since this is one of Koontz's early and very popular novels, the basic plot is probably well known to most readers so I will only provide a relatively brief summary. (In addition, there are already hundreds of other reviews available for readers who prefer a more detailed discussion of the book.)  This review will hopefully be of more interest and more value to potential readers of WATCHERS by providing a discussion of my reactions to the story and by describing my reasons for recommending that anyone with the time available should strongly consider listening to the unabridged audio CD version rather than reading the book. (Warning: it consists of 13 CD's and is approximately 15 hours in length.) <br /> <br />Travis Cornell is a man in the throes of despair; he has been unsuccessful in his search to instill some purpose in his life following the horrible tragedy which has befallen him. The reader meet Travis walking through the woods and contemplating his past and future; suddenly a golden retriever appears and the agitated dog surprisingly insists on Travis  immediately leaving the area.  Travis' feeling of unease is gradually replaced by an increasingly preternatural dread; they safely return to Travis' car and Travis speeds away taking the dog with him. The dog's anxiety gradually lessens but never disappears; several incidents cause Travis to realize that the dog seems very intelligent, and the dog (presciently named Einstein) causes Travis to focus on something other than himself. A chance encounter soon changes their lives; they meet Nora Devon, a withdrawn and very self-critical woman who is soon saved by Einstein's seeming sixth sense. As you undoubtedly will surmise, this story is much more complex and sinister than simply a boy meets dog meets girl romance novel. <br /> <br />As Travis and Nora soon learn, there is another main character in this drama, \\"The Outsider\\", a sinister yet pathetic bioengineered beast (as intelligent as Einstein) who has escapedfrom the same top secret lab as Einstein and who seems intent on horribly mutilating whatever victims happen to cross his path as he single mindedly stalks Einstein across the countryside. The supporting cast is also well drawn and integral to the plot - among them, Vince, the really weird mob hit man who is pursing eternal life; Lemuel Johnson, the NSA operative who is tasked with retrieving the escapees and keeping the truth hidden from the public; and Walt Gaines, the local sheriff and Lem's long time friend who is increasingly frustrated by Lem's secrecy regarding the truth behind the horrific murders occurring in his jurisdiction. The story is long with several unpredictable twists but the plot is quite simple; it is Koontz' skill as a storyteller and the philosophical questions which it addresses which make it a compelling tale. <br /> <br />I was caught up as soon as I listened to the first chapter; my reactions ranged from tension to excitement to tears to pure joy. The interaction and development of the three main characters - Travis, Einstein, and Nora - is wonderfully handled even if predictable in many respects. This is truly a story where the details matter, a totally faithful summary of the complete storyline would probably only take a few pages but in no way do it justice, as is true of many of Koontz' works. As the story unfolded, I felt that I was participating in the action and cheering for my new friends to all safely reach the end of the novel alive and together as an intact family despite the great odds which they would have to overcome. The transformation of each of them and the bond which gradually joined them together as their adventure proceeded provided many pleasant hours of listening. <br /> <br />I have read many of Koontz' recent novels and enjoyed them tremendously, and thus decided to read some of his earlier works. This book was on a par in terms of my enjoyment with my previous favorite - LIFE EXPECTANCY - despite the very differentconstruction and tone. I had not previously listened to audio books, but was planning to be doing a lot traveling by myself and searched for something in which I could become completely absorbed in order to pass the time quickly. This so completely captivated me that on a few occasions I hated the trip segment to end and could scarcely wait to move the CD from my car to my portable player so that I could resume listening to the story.  <br /> <br />I thought the rendition was excellent; the narrator J. Charles faithfully captured the changes in mood as the story progressed as well as successfully differentiating among the characters through very distinct and individual intonations. Especially compelling was Einstein's progressively intelligent and loveable \\"WOOF\\". In effect, listening to this book rather than looking at the printed page allowed me to visualize the story as it proceeded, the word pictures were often so vivid and dramatic that I frequently felt as if I were at the movies. So, if you are either an habitual user of audio books or simply an avid reader with an inclination to listen to a story instead of reading a book, I recommend this production. (As an aside, the technique adopted by Brilliance Audio of having seamless tracks averaging less a minute each was incredibly useful both when I had to interrupt my listening or change CD players for some reason or if my attention was momentarily diverted and I wanted to replay a short segment without having to listen to a several minute interval.) <br /> <br />This is a story of many moods - from the terror of gruesome killings to the great joy of self-discovery, friendship and love. Among the many wonderful elements, the two which will always stick in my mind are the concluding few chapters together with the scenes where Nora and Travis gradually improve their methodology for communicating with Einstein. Maybe it is because I feel a strong bond to our family's golden retriever, but the those seemed pitch perfect to me and the use of the \\"communication machine\\" which they eventually designed was wonderful to contemplate. But I refuse to divulge any further details, so you'll have to read the book both to discover their secret and to learn the derivation of the title.  <br /> <br />Tucker Andersen
B00065GWK6|3.0|I really like this movie and the charachters in it.  I even bought the dvd, and I don't own many.  Especially \\"comedies\\".   <br /> <br />When I first watched Napoleon, the blandness and the rudeness took me by surprise at the beginning.  And the immaturity.  I didn't see the appeal of the film at all.  Then, Napoleon danced.  To help his friend, Pedro.  You sense he didn't want to do it and wasn't sure about what to do, but he did it anyway and didn't hang around afterwards to soak in any glory or appreciation for himself. And the film let Pedro have his moment of disbelief and astonished joy. He comes alive.  Then, I liked Napoleon much better.  Whenever I have a bad day, I watch the dance and Pedro's reaction afterwards.  Everything else up that occurs up to that point becomes almost forgivable, because under all the pettiness there is a heart to this movie.  Which almost got lost. If it wasn't for Pedro and Nap's friendship, the movie would have been a zero.   <br /> <br />What would have made it better?  I think more depth with why Napoleon was so frustrated with life and relationships in his family.  He's still half asleep even at the film's conclusion.  I'm not asking for him to be drastically changed, but for at least for the poor fellow to gain some self awareness or lesson learned from his ordeal with life. <br /> <br />I did like LaFawnduh.  I keep reading how there is no sex in this movie.  The relationship she had with Kip was full of chemistry, which saved it from teetering between \\"yew\\" and too cutesy.  The fact that he took off with her was centered completely on sex.  Although Kip finally developed in that aspect of his life, it didn't mean that he grew up. It remains to be seen if LaFawnduh becomes another substitute for Grandma, or if Kip steps up to the plate and delivers on his potential under LaFawnduh's positive influence.   <br /> <br />Deb was perfect.  I liked the fact that film gave her a chance to tell Napoleon off, even though she was mislead by Uncle Ric. It's good to know she was learning to speak her mind instead of running off. And that Nap was willing to take responsibility and make amends with her with a \\"freshly caught bass\\" even though Uncle Ric was ruining his life.  I was hoping that Deb's poise and maturity was softening Napoleon's rough edges.   <br /> <br />So, I enjoyed it, but it could have been a better movie.
B0000C9JFO|2.0|Have you ever wondered what a twentysomething man with a full head of hair would look like if he adopted a comb-over? Yes? Then \\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" is your kind of movie! Why our hero Xavier does this is never explained, but of course women go wild over him anyway in this movie, a rustic haze of exchange-student wish-fulfillment. His gf back in Paris makes up with him even though he stands her up on her birthday, and a feminine, modelesque lesbian gives him hands-on seduction tips, which he soon puts to work on the young wife of a neurologist (who has a more traditional comb-over). <br /> <br />Xavier is an upper-middle class metrosexual who talks like he grew up listening to NPR. He takes \\"stupid American\\" to mean \\"stupid white American man,\\" he takes \\"Europe\\" to mean \\"Western Europe,\\" he displays his backside (the opposite sex does not reciprocate) - you get the idea. So - after this grueling year at the Real World Barcelona - learning about stock options, trying rudimentary salsa dancing, and keeping his unnecessary comb-over in place, can Xavier graduate and rise to the challenge of accepting a cushy job in the French bureaucracy? (I'm not making this up.) If you can stand the suspense, watch this movie. <br /> <br />Sharing a funky little Catalan flat with Xavier are other EU scholars. Some of them don't get much screen time, but they're all photogenic and I'm sure they're absolutely cool people - at one point their mugs are flashed on screen in a montage so we know they were important to Xavier and they changed his life. Do I hear sequel? <br /> <br />This movie has dialogue in English, French, Spanish and Catalan - it must have been tough for the subtitlers, who make one obvious blooper - \\"hair-brained.\\" Hey, looking at Xavier too long will do that. <br /> <br />I'm afraid \\"L'Auberge Espagnole\\" got an R-rating, which is barely deserved. How `bout \\"PG-15\\"? <br />
B000000W5H|5.0|This disc is a classic. To my taste, the Stones have only released one or two better discs since this time. \\"Time waits for no one\\" features some great guitar playing from Mick. \\"If you can't rock me\\" is the classic Stones sound. The title track is as good as it gets and a true rock anthem. Even the old standard \\"Ain't too proud to beg\\" sounds like a Stones original here; it fits right in. Contrary to what some other reviewers wrote, I do not feel that this album is a hodgepog of styles. It is coherent, with a definite feel that carries throughout the album. It is my personal favorite album from this incarnation of the band and, apparently, very underrated. Repeated listening at loud volumes recommended.
B000AM6MKU|2.0|We bought this package because of the globe and train.  When I opened the box, the globe's plug was out of the bottom and it had leaked.  Now, I'm stuck either waiting for the manufacturer to replace it or for Amazon, but either way I have a very disappointed little boy here. :(
0670033375|4.0|I was hoping for a book as good as the author's other work (the excellent Guns, Germs, and Steel). Although the research presented in this book is thorough and the conclusions important,  this book is not nearly as compelling a read as GG&S. While the topic is extremely relevant to contemporary society in the USA, the presentation is lethargic. The author starts out with an exploration of present-day Montana, which immediately had me skipping paragraphs out of sheer boredom. However, subsequent chapters were more interesting; topics included Easter Island, the Anasazi, Icelanders, contemporary 1st- and 3rd-world countries, and population control. My favourite chapter included an analysis of how humans react to environmental collapse. The author's supposition of what the Easter Islanders said as they were chopping down the last tree on that island was well thought out. <br /> <br />I was a bit disappointed that the author did not mention much on the collapse of the Roman empire (only one paragraph), but I suppose this topic would have been too trite. <br /> <br />All in all, the in-depth and detailed research of environmental problems and the human responses to them was extremely impressive. I just wish the author had done a better job tightening the presentation. <br /> <br />P.S. I learned a new word from reading this book: \\"middens.\\"
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This was the first album that I bought in the spring of 2004.  I generally am very critical of the value of contemporary music.  I find The White Stripes, Modest Mouse and The Killers tedious.  But this album is something else.<br /><br />I like Talking Heads and bought this album on the recommendation that Franz Ferdinand sounded similar.  To be honest though, the only song on this album that sounds close to them is \\"Tell Her Tonight.\\"  I honestly can't think of another band that sounds anything like them, except for maybe The Killers and The Bravery, and they were cited by Rolling Stone as having come after.<br /><br />Actually, another band that they sound like (barely, though, in my estimation) is The Beatles.  The band claims the influence from them in the sense that they want to write serious lyrics for catchy, upbeat songs.  Some of these songs are certainly heartfelt, if sexy (example: \\"Dark of the Matinee\\").  Furthermore, like The Beatles back in their era, FF does a good job in its era of getting girls dancing.  Also, Blender magazine placed \\"Take Me Out\\" in the top 100 of \\"The Best 500 Songs Since You Were Born,\\" and it keeps reminding me of Wings' \\"Band On The Run\\" for some reason.<br /><br />I don't know why this band isn't more popular in the US.  Maybe they haven't been able to blow through some of the garbage that passes for music these days.  In any case the group seems to like Seattle a lot; if they just want to keep coming out here that's fine with me.
B00005JN0T|5.0|This is the best science fiction movie that I have seen in a long time. It has elements from the sci-fi classics, such as Terminator, Bladerunner, Total Recall, Spiderman.<br /><br />The main character Will Smith drives a bicycle with sunglasses just like Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />The scenery is futuristic, with beautiful shiny buildings. The cars and buses are concept vehicles of the future.<br /><br />The robots are cool and behave like a mixture of the Terminator and Spiderman. The story is captivating, it held my attention completely. I am a fan of Asimov's stories and this is a very good bridge between the worlds of books and movies.<br /><br />About some of the weaknesses that I noticed: the leading robot Sonny has an unstable character and he is sometimes a good guy, sometimes a bad guy. The other robots behave in a somewhat immature way, jumping on walls like spidermen.<br /><br />The end is too humble, with the robot rebellion ending and the robots becoming nice again. I wished for a more revolutionary end. In any case, I'm very happy that I saw this flick. Perhaps the world of the future will look exactly like in the movie.
B00005JO1G|5.0|Jarhead is not a typical war film. It focuses on how life changes when you go to war, not on the war itself. Instead of constantly seeing battle scenes and death, we see what is a little more important, the humanity of the soldiers and their transformation as people. We see training, goofing off, suspicions of unfaithful girlfriends at home, mental anguish, and soldiers in a war who do not know why they are fighting.<br /><br />The film is incredibly fluid and incredibly powerful all until the very last scene. All of the dialogue seems natural even if the words are clich&eacute;. They ring true. However, the very last scene seems forced as if the writer wanted to wrap up the film neatly. It was not done well.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is great as the main character Swoffard. He brings raw emotionalism to the screen. He plays the character in a way that everyone can understand and relate to. His performance is key to the film because it makes the story seem personal.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is surprisingly good in his role as the Staff Sergeant. He is real, raw, and relatable. He shows both the aggression and strength of a military official and the frankness and dynamic personality of a regular citizen.<br /><br />Although the film takes place in the desert, the scenery is gorgeous. Chopping this film up to fit a television screen will hinder it enormously. The widescreen is employed beautifully. One of the most poignant scenes in the film is where the oil wells are burnt. The sky is black, there is oil falling from the sky like rain, and and the soldiers look around at hell. The scenery is so vivid and striking; it is unsettling in an extremely effective way.<br /><br />The music in this film is also utilized to great effect. Songs are never distracting to the film; they always fit the scenes to illustrate them but never to overpower them.<br /><br />This film leaves the audience with an overall feeling of sadness. These men lost their former lives in a war that lasted only a few days. The audience is brought into that struggle and that loss, leaving with a feeling similar to that of those involved. This is a thought provoking film.struggle and that loss, leaving with a feeling similar to that of those involved. This is a thought provoking film.
B000002KCI|5.0|Honestly for once I really dont know what to say about this album, its that good. Its just straight forward rock and roll, and some of the best Neil Young And Crazy Horse or any musicians have ever created. While I cant find the right words to explain to you how good this album is I also feel that you could really never say enough about it, given you can find the words of course. Starting with the musicianship. Neil Youngs guitar playing is amazing as always, 'Cortez The Killer' showcases that. His lyrics and passion were never stronger or more present, 'Barstole Blues' is a prime example. This is the second time Crazy Horse was created as being on the album even though I think they have played on almost all his albums. Here they shine brighter then ever.<br /><br />As for the music, well it speeks for itself. Zuma opens with 'Dont Cry No Tears' which is labled a nice little grunge song which it kind of is but I would just say its a killer rock song done Neil Young style. 'Danger Bird' is a nice slower song with great vocals from Young, and boy is this a good song, man you really gotta hear to fully grasp how wonderful it is. Much like 'Danger Bird' 'Pardon My Heart' is another slower acoustical song done as only Neil could do. While the last two songs were slower 'Lookin For Love' is an upbeat country flavored rock song that is exactly what people came to know Neil for and songs like this one are what made the man famous.<br /><br />'Barstole Blues' may very well be the very best song that Neil Young ever wrote and recorded. The guitar is great, and his lyrics are really great as well. But for me its all about the delivery, and Neil is known for playing and singing with intense passion, but not like this, the way he sings this song is nothing short of amazing. You can hear him pooring his heart out all over this song. Its amazing.<br /><br />'Stupid Girl' is almost grunge but not quite, kind of like the albums opener. 'Stupid Girl' would have fir in perfectly on, On The Beach because it jsut seems like it came from the same vein, I wonder if all those songs were written at the same time. 'Drive Back' is a cool rocker with a nice chorus and great lead guitar playing by Young, some of his best. If you wanna talk about classics, then 'Cortez The Killer' is exactley that, one of Neil Youngs all time best songs. The guitar solo is concidered among many to be one of the all times best, and I as a guitar player must agree. Though I think Cortez should have ended the album, 'Through The Sails' is a nice acoustic song, almost like CSN&Y but better. Its a really peaeceful way to end the album.<br /><br />Zuma is an often over looked album in the Neil Young cannon and I can't understand why. Its an amazing album, and in my book it is far better then Harvest. Zuma is a album that no one and I mean no one should go with out hearing at least one time in you life, so if you are some who reads my reviews then I am telling you this is one album you must hear! Make it your next pruches.ly on, On The Beach because it jsut seems like it came from the same vein, I wonder if all those songs were written at the same time.

B000AA305M|4.0|CD is great - hard to produce another good cd after the likes of white ladder, but he manages to do it here. it's a great cd, fun to listen to, and different from the same crap you hear on the radio. <br /> <br />as for the protection, there is a way around it, so i'm not fussed anymore. actually i do believe DMB has it on their website since so many people complained. I wont write it here in case that's illegal, but just look for it on google. then you're set to enjoy this!
B000BM6AVA|2.0|First off, It hurts to see SOAD slide in this direction. They are capable of creating a far better album. A lot of people are criticizing Daron's vocals(which I can completely understand). I think Daron is a great singer..in his place,which is singing harmony for Serj. Daron is not a front man, and they shouldn't let him attempt it. How did Rick Rubin,with his esteemed reputation, let some of this material out? Hopefully they can fall back to their original sound ie.SOAD or Toxicity.
B000BPCCZA|5.0|I've been a SOAD fan ever since their debut album.  I've seen them at ozzfest and have been waiting day by day for the release of hypnotize.  Now that I have it, I can easily state that this CD is brilliant.  Along with mesmerize, SOAD have really stepped up the notch and delivered an epic two disc masterpiece.  They've matured a lot in their music, and have given SOAD fans exactly what they've been waiting for.  My only complaints would be that each CD was somewhat too short for me, and could easily have fit onto one full length CD.  Also, Daron's lyrics sometimes get a little too mainstream for me, like shouting yeah and alright in the beginning of \\"stealing society\\", which I felt didn't really fit in with the music.  He did, however, do an excellent job on the rest of the album, but only as a backup to Serj.  We don't need two main vocalists, just one, and a backup if necessary.   <br /> <br />The packaging is awesome, the CD cases go together flawlessly and look awesome.  The only other problem I can think of is the dualdisc.  I have to say that each dualdisc I come across sucks royally.  None have nearly as much as they state they do, and they always let me down.  It's just another scam to make more money.  This dualdisc is no exception, and in my opinion, is not even worth the extra 3 dollars.  I would have rather had the original artwork on the top of the disc, so that it would better match the mesmerize CD.  The \\"recording of mesmerize/hypnotize\\" featurette is horrible and not at all what I had expected.  All it is is random clips of homemovies tied together to poorly explain the making of process.  The movies are extremely poor quality, and most of the time it's difficult to comprehend what's even happening.  I guess it matches SOAD's abstract style, but I've been waiting for a good SOAD DVD for ages, with no luck whatsoever.  The bottom line is that the DVD side blows, and the only cool thing was watching John speak, which seems like a rarity in itself.  But yeah, I guess if your a true fan, then go ahead and buy the dualdisc, otherwise, just go with the other one, cause it's not worth it.  As for a good DVD, PLEASE MAKE A SOAD DVD WORTH BUYING.  INCLUDE CONCERT FOOTAGE, BEHIND THE SCENES, INTERVIEWS, AND ALL MUSIC VIDEOS!  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, THE FANS ARE BEGGING YOU!!!
B0001HAHXW|5.0|I love this Cd. I am also an avid fan of Mr. Johnson and have studied his music extensivly, and I have always wondered what he would sound like with a full band. Let me tell you, Eric Clapton sure hit this one on the head. Each song is a gem, and has every musical nuance that the originals had. I highly recommend this to any blues fan!!
0553801503|3.0|This book does not contain the action nor the interest of the previous three books in the series.  I typically like GRRM's writing, but I do not think it is as important as the plot.  In this book, the plot fails to hold together.   <br /> <br />Editing of this book to only include characters from certain regions of the realm is ok, but the lack of action is the problem.
B000002H70|5.0|I bought this album about eleven years ago when I was only a junior in high school.  This was one of the only CD's that I had that I listened to almost every day, and it never left my car at all.  All of the emotions that it evoked were very meaningful to me at the time as a sad, confused, lonely teenager looking for solace anywhere he could find it.  Mr. Smith and crew did it for me.  Disintegration worked magic for me, filling me with light and hope, even with songs that were ladened with morbid lyrics.  The music itself is haunting, with great guitars interwoven with dark synth.  When I listen to this music today, I still feel the inspiration that this band gave me years ago.  Who couldn't love the glorious melancholy found on songs like closedown and the same deep water as you?  Who wouldn't want to rock to songs like disintegration and fascination street.  And who wouldn't want to feel the love brought out by lovesong and homesick.  A masterpice, then and now.
B000002JS6|5.0|I stole a cassette from a friend's mother and it happened to be \\"High Voltage\\".  Bon Scott was the ultimate rock n' roll singer.  Hell, women, drinkin, and whatever wasn't right spewed. I missed that tour because I traded my tickets for a car stero. I've regretted it ever since.  I had no hope for the black album and dissmissed it before listening.  Good God, this I rate along with Guns Appetite and Buckcherry's debut.  Doesn't matter, pick any track and hang on to your azz.
B000268QB2|5.0|I am a lover of God's gift to rock and roll:  the electric guitar.  I have always loved to hear the chords reverbate through an amp as a talented musician tears through a riff or puts out great blues.  With this English band Keane, it doesn't even matter that there is no guitar at all.  They are stellar.  Their pop-rock ebbs and flows just as well as any guitar driven band, due to the fact that they have an excellent pianist, drummer, and singer.  I don't know these guys names, don't care really, all that matters is that their music is great. They've got songs that nearly anyone can sing along with,if that's what you're into, like This is the Last Time, Somewhere Only We Know, and Everybody's Changing.  And they also have beautiful songs that make you want to be with your lover, such as We Might as Well be Strangers, and one of the most beautiful songs of the year, Bedshaped.  If you are a lover of good pop-rock, and don't mind if there is no guitar in the stuff, I recommend that you check out Keane.

B000BM6AVA|2.0|how the hell could any of you guys praise this album? there is nothing memorable, catchy, or worthy of acclaim in hypnotize. mezmerize was a very solid album with very catchy and memorable songs. this album is garbage on every degree. hypnotize is to mezmerize what reload is to load by metallica: a bunch of rehashed rejected songs that didnt make the first cut. im dissappointed with this album so much, but not matter what i say, youll all disagree with my review and buy it anyways.
B00005JO1P|5.0|We went after Thanksgiving dinner with a group fo five ranging in age for 60 to 27.  All of us loved it.  I had a hard time buying Joaquin Phoenix as Cash at first.  But as the movie rolled I saw think he captured Cash very well.  And Reese Witherspoon astonished,us all with a superb performance.  We loved the sanpshots of Elvis and others including Jerry Lee Lewis.  See it!
B000AJJNPY|4.0|It's been almost three years since Sigur Ros released their last full length, (), and in the meantime they've toured all over the world and put out a couple halfhearted EPs. It was some time ago that I read that they were recording their upcoming release in the bottom of an empty indoor pool which they had converted into a studio. Over the years, several songs that the group played live (and were presumed to be new tracks they were working on) leaked out, some of which I enjoyed, and some of which I felt were sort of treading the same ground.<br /><br />Really, though, the group has carved out a somewhat unique realm for themselves in terms of music, and there isn't any huge need for them to do anything drastically different (although collaborative project releases that weren't official, such as Odin's Raven Magic were quite good). In a way, Takk... is sort of a return to form for the group after the somewhat cumbersome (). The group toys with shorter track lengths and some more upbeat and uplifting sonics, and the result is yet another solid album from the group.<br /><br />The first half of the release include some of the better work that the group has done to date, with some familiar sounds and new twists mixed together in delightful ways. The short opening album-titled \\"Takk...\\" is all shimmering electronics and bowed guitar while \\"Glôsôli\\" chugs along with a super juicy bassline, chimes, and layered, swirling vocals from Jonski Birgisson. The track ebbs and flows, adding guitars, music box, and even more instrumentation until it explodes with a loud and glorious finale that's absolutely stunning.<br /><br />\\"H&ograve;ppipolla\\" is a lush, orchestral track that mixes strings, piano, chimes, and lush vocals into a short track that may very well be one of the poppiest things the group has ever done. \\"Sê Lest\\" finds the group experimenting with some new sounds as filtered vocal snippets coo and mix with vibes and chimes as strings provide a warm backdrop. The track is lighthearted and playful and drops off into a more electronic midsection before bursting with an almost silly horn section that will bring a smile to the face of all but the most jaded. If \\"Glôsôli\\" weren't enough of a scorcher, \\"Sægl&ograve;pur\\" opens with more playful vocal glints and chimes before slowly progressing into the loudest track on the disc, blaring with huge guitars and pummeling at the end.<br /><br />The album doesn't quite maintain its momentum throughout, and actually drags in several places during the latter half. \\"Milan&oacute;\\" clocks in at over ten minutes and just sort of floats along in a pretty, gooey mass of warm sounds while \\"Andvari\\" drags like a drippy ballad with its too-polished guitar and string mixture. \\"Svehlj&oacute;tt\\" opens in much the same way, but fortunately frees itself with a more explosive ending.<br /><br />Although the album isn't groundbreaking, it does contain several new wrinkles in sound for the group, and most of them work quite well. It's actually the tracks that stick to a more standard lineup (guitar/bass/strings/percussion/vocals) that feel the most laborious on the release, and unlike some of their experimentation on their previous shorter EPs, their excusions with different instrumentation blend in much better on Takk... As mentioned above, the album seems a bit frontloaded and seems to lose some steam during the second half, but I still have to admit that the group can pack a serious whallop when they get down to business.<br /><br />(from almost cool music reviews)s lighthearted and playful and drops off into a more electronic midsection before bursting with an almost silly horn section that will bring a smile to the face of all but the most jaded.

630460291X|5.0|This film is on our list of favourites. We thought the cast worked great together. Especially when broken off into their dueted scenes: Freeman and Costner; Mastrangelo and Costner; Costner and Rickman; Rickman and Mastrangelo.<br /><br />Yes, this is one of Rickman's best rolls. It is also one of Mastrangelo's. She was perfect as Maid Marion. Costner is cute and charming. It's easy to forget about who the actors are and get pulled into this timeless story. We've watched this numerous times and still laugh, cry and cheer the characters on.
B000B8QF14|5.0|Whatever you do buy this album. The CD is great it includes only the hits, the only songs not hits are: Are We the Waiting, St. Jimmy, and Jesus of Suburbia. The DVD is awesome. All footage of them in england. 151 minutes of just Green Day. Buy this album, you will be impressed I promise. Peace.
B0009S3HI0|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a Deftones fan and when I saw this CD/DVD out I jumped on it, but what I'm not a fan of is acoustic versions of really great heavy songs. They seem to lose something in the process. I skipped through the CD pretty quick on the way home with nothing really catching my attention. I figured the DVD would be better with the original videos of songs I really like, but I forgot that the Deftones' videos aren't that great. Take  \\"Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)\\" for instance. Song is great, but dancing around with a hose under a bridge or whatever it is they're under is not great. Die hard Deftones fans will probably like this CD/DVD, but I felt is was lacking.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I just bought the cd this week and I can not stop hearing it. I'm at work and I play it over and over I can not really choose a favorite one I like them all! When she came out with American Life, it was good, but not as good as this! Madonna is BACK! Well, actually she was never gone to begin with. I highly recommend you go out and buy this album, you will not regret it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|With all the stuff she's put from 1999 - 2005 with the debut to her greatest hits and remix cd, i still find this above even her greatest hits. it has it's ups and downs. i've never found a Britney cd to be perfect but this seems to be as close as it's gotten. <br /> <br />1 - Me Against The Music 10/10 love the prechorus rap thingy <br />2 - (I've Got That) Boom Boom 10/10 one of her all-time best <br />3 - Showdown 10/10 awesome but took a bit to get used to it <br />4 - Breathe On Me 10/10 a very nice techno edge for Britney <br />5 - Early Morning 8/10 lacks a little, but not bad <br />6 - Toxic 10/10 fast, catchy and a great video <br />7 - Outrageous 9/10 was great but it's now a little annoying <br />8 - Touch Of My Hand 10/10 love love love <br />9 - Hook Up 8/10 another early morning/just like everyother song <br />10 - Shadow 10/10 good lyrics, very deep, great ballad <br />11 - Brave New Girl 10/10 good but cheesy/verse lacks a little <br />12 - Everytime 9/10 became annoying after video was released <br />13 - Me Against The Music Remix 10/10 almost catchier than the original. would make a great club song. <br /> <br />4/5 almost a 5 but has a couple set backs but it's worth your money. don't rush out and get it immediately but keep it in your mental wish list.
1573229725|4.0|It's been a while since I read this book, so bear with me.<br /><br />Sue Trinder stays with people whose business isn't quite legal. She gets pulled into a plot to steal a great deal of money from a young lady. She must pretend to be the lady's maid in order to help her partner in crime convince the lady to fall in love with him.<br /><br />They succeed, and then the plot twists and twists some more.<br /><br />The book switches between the two girls -- the lady, Maud, and Sue -- as one ends up in a mental hospital and the other is held prisoner.<br /><br />The side characters are delicious. The villains are fun in their own ways, and the other characters who live with the Sucksbys are amusing and well drawn.<br /><br />Maud and Sue fall in love. Not much time is given to parts that are entirely about their romance, but it is still believable. However, I think it would have been better if they'd gotten a little more time.<br /><br />Sue, particularly near the end, can be very stupid. I was banging my head against the wall during some parts. Maud also has her stupid moments, although she has a better excuse.<br /><br />Fingersmith is a good book, and worth reading. It's long, though, so be prepared to spend some time on it. I managed to read it in one day, but I had nothing but time on my hands and I read very quickly.
B00097DXZS|1.0|A scapegoat, unfortunately Santana's and Van Zant's music have become the whipping boys which Sony has refused to defend from the consumer backlash. <br /> <br />Listen, it's not so much the 'All That I Am' part of the title we have a problem with, Sony. It's the 'Copy-Protected' section we're picking a bone with. And since you have violated the consumers' rights, you had better get a damned good lawyer.
0553801503|5.0|I will not comment on the book except to say that it is excellent.  If you made it this far in the series then you will not be disappointed unless you are some whiner who cries about not seeing your favorite character in the book.  These idiots will feel stupid after reading the next half of the book and they realize that these other characters were necessary to move a plot this complex along. <br />This is as good as it gets people.  Shut it.
B0006L16N8|3.0|The third album. It is often the third album that sets the tone for a band's career. Radiohead's OK Computer, Pain of Salvation's Perfect Element I, Metallica's Master of Puppets being some examples. <br /> <br />Many of us saw in this British alt-rock band the talent, to forge a new path for the tired and cliched alt-rock movement, and finally release an explosive and groundbreaking mainstream album (possibly not done since 1973's Dark Side of the Moon, people!) <br /> <br />The sound of this album starts to break down after Speed of Sound, and then becomes mere background music, with nothing to really grab your attention and say \\"YES, THIS IS COLDPLAY!\\" The music and the lyrics on this album are good, but to the more discerning of us, does it not sound the same as Parachutes and Rush of Blood? Horrors of horrors, could they be going down the same road as AC/DC? Could they be another Nickelback (aaargh!)? <br /> <br />This is better than 80% of mainstream music, mind you, but Coldplay should not be in this shallow market. Coldplay should at least give Radiohead a run for their money, and dare I say it, become part of the progressive movement. <br /> <br />And exposed to the harsh environment that is MUSIC, Coldplay has backed off and turtled back into the safe haven of radio and MTV. I truly hope that this album does not point to the direction that Coldplay's music will take into the future, or it will be yet another case of 'What could have been', and music will be the poorer for it.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|This is an awesome Box Set. The remaster edition itself is worth the waiting. I can't just wait until Columbia decides to release the whole Springsteen discography on remaster editions, as it has been done with Dylan.<br /><br />Well, besides the remaster edition, that Box Set comes with 2 great additions. The first is the documentary, which is excellent. It's nice to see Mike Appel today talking about the recording of his last work with Bruce. You get to see Bruce driving around Freehold and Asbury Park, showing us the house where he composed the whole album on the piano. Some parts of the documentary are Bruce explaining the meaning of the songs (a little bit like what he did on the Storytellers VH1 TV Show). All the members of the band, including Ernest \\"Boom\\" Carter and David Sancious (and Lofgren and Scialfa, who I don't think should be there) give us their opinions and experiences on recording the album. Iovine and Landau appear as well on the documentary. Also, as an extra, the first DVD comes with a mini Live show: 3 songs from a 1973 concert. The sound is excellent, and we got the chance to see Vinny Lopez on drums with the first E Street Band.<br /><br />The second addition is the London Hammersmith Odeon concert from 1972. I had the chance to see a preview on the Glory Days Symposium in New Jersey (September 2005) and we were all shocked by the quality of the sound and the more than just ok image quality. I just watched the whole concert today on my Home Theatre System and the experience was so thrilling I couldn't believe what I was watching. The whole show is just awesome, with the E Street Band kicking asses here and there. It is a great opportunity to see the band back in the early 70's, again, with a great sound and a brilliant set list.<br /><br />I don't care about the box, or the CD sleeves. I care about the music, and the music is just AWESOME. Of course everything can be done better, but the music, and the movies can't get better. So let's be fair and give this CD what it deserves, which is nothing less than 5 stars. Everybody should own this BOX SET in his/her collection, being Born to Run one of the TOP 10 Best Rock Records ever.his CD what it deserves, which is nothing less than 5 stars.

0385482582|1.0|This is by far the worst business book I have read in recent years.  It is hard to believe that Andy Grove actually thought that this material was worth putting into a book.  As other reviews have said, this book at most should have been a short article in Business Week...but even then it would require some actual content to make it worth reading.  The best part of the book is the quotes on the cover from Steve Jobs et al.  It makes me wonder if they even read the book.
B00006RU5B|5.0|So here's the album with the mix of rage and soundgarden. Let me tell you, it's is absolutely fantastic! Every song has the fire, energy, and attitude that rage and soundgarden both had. Chris's vocals are so inspiring and soulful. Tom's guitar playing is just out of this world! He does the unthinkable with the instrament. Brad and Tim also have many highpoints on this album. soundgarden = great    rage against the machine = great  audioslave = Just as great!  Many people say this band is horrible because they just take the techniques that they used in their previous bands to make this album. I totally disagree. I love RATM and Soundgarden, but after listening to this album many times, i like audioslave more than both and respect them as their own unique band, not just as \\"rage garden\\" as people seem to say.            Now for the songs...    1. COCHISE : What a way to start the album! I love how it builds up the anticipation at the begining, with the almost truck engine starting guitar sound. Then bang! It kicks into fast paced fantastic riffing while Chris's voclas wail excellently. First single off the album, and a great one.    10/10    2. SHOW ME HOW TO LIVE : Another song that got a good amount of airplay, but a great song none the less. The yelling chorus is just fantastic and will be in your head forever. Good stuff.  9/10    3. GASOLINE : What a song! Wow, this song really stands out as a favorite for me. The guitar work on this track is fenominal, as Tom is using the tremolo pedal it seems. Awesome sounding stuff. Chris's vocals are in top form as well. This is one of the heavier tracks on the album and pumps me up every time i hear it. \\"Burnin that gasoline!!\\" outstanding  10/10    4. WHAT YOU ARE : Now this song is a bit more melodic and smooth, but builds up to a screaming chorus that really rocks hard. This is a great song, but a tiny pinch down from the previous songs.  9/10    5. LIKE A STONE : You must have heard this song if your reading a review for this album because this was definatley the biggest hit of the album. The \\"black hole sun\\" for audioslave. Excellent lyrics roumored to be about the death of the legendary Layne Staley. R.I.P. I did find out though, that these roumors were not true. The song was written before his death. Anyways, the solo in this song is one of the best solos ever. It just soars through your ears with such emotion. Incredible!  10/10    6. SET IT OFF : The intro to this song is definatley the best intro on the album. Tom uses some funky pedal to give it the strangest sound but yet sounds amazing. This song is another \\"pumper - upper\\" as I call it. The chorus has such a great beat and rythm. When Chris yells \\"set it off!\\" it sends a great feeling through your bones.  10/10    7. SHADOW ON THE SUN : Beauty, aggression and deppression all in one. This might just be the best song on the album! Touching lyrics and a chilling chorus. It starts off slow, and then builds into an aggressive chorus, until finally at the end Chris roars \\"Shadow on the sun!\\" repeadidly. The solo in this song is the greatest sounding thing ever! It sounds like aliens playing guitar and if your floating in outerspace absorbing the vibe. Such a classic!  10/10    8. I AM THE HIGHWAY : This is a relaxing, calm, and amazing song. Chris acctually does some accoustic guitar work on this. The chorus is so soothing and really puts you in a trance and just suddenly makes everything feel perfect; like you have no worries. Listen to this when depressed. It really does a number on you.  10/10    9. EXPLODER : Many fans say that this song is just average leaving you luke - warm. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best tracks on the album. I love the drums and bass on this song, with the super simple guitar riff and fantastic vocals. Also some really cool lyrics if you understand the story it's telling.  10/10    10. HYPNOTIZE : Ok, well here's the song that i don't particularly like too much and often skip. It's different from anything else on the album and for that I respect it. To me it's just nothing great, but certainly listenable.  7/10    11. BRING EM BACK ALIVE : Epic masterpiece. Along with shadow on the sun, this is the best song on the album. Chris uses some vocal device that gives him almost a robotic sound that is just so cool. The heavy chorus really gets your blood boiling as well. The best part of this song though, is the solo. Easily the best solo on the album. I believe he is using a whammy on it and it sound so amazing. You must hear to know what I'm saying. Insane!!  10/10    12. LIGHT MY WAY : Heavy! A nice heavy chorus in which Chris sings wondefully. The screeching guitar at the begining is excellent as well. When your listening to this and you suddenly hear cell phone noises, your not losing it; it's in the song and gives it a sweet little edge.   10/10    13. GETAWAY CAR : This is truly a beautiful song. Cheerful lyrics and a soothing chorus. I really, really love this song. This is Chris's best vocal performance on the album. I get chills every time I hear this gem.  10/10    14. THE LAST REMAING LIGHT : Great way to close the album! Another one of Chris's best vocal performances on the album. This song would fit on Chris's solo album. For some reason when I listen to this song it makes me want to just lay down and let the myself absorb the music. Also for some strange reason, this song is good to listen to on a rainy day.   10/10    So thats it. The end of the album. By the time your done rocking out to gasoline, relaxing to i am the highway, banging your head to bring em back alive, and absorbing the feel of the last remaining light you will be stunned. This album is one of the best albums ever recorded. Shadow on the sun is one of the  best songs ever written. well the albums average is 135/140. I'd say that's amazing! Buy this now and get blown away time after time!
B000B8IA2G|5.0|I don't have much time to write a hugely long review, but I just wanted to say that this is a marvelous series!  For those of you who have seen the show and are considering purchasing these, it is definitely worth the investment.  The commentaries with the actors, particularly \\"Sanctuary\\" with Torri Higginson and Rachel Luttrell and \\"Hide and Seek\\" and \\"38 Minutes\\" with Rachel and Paul McGillion are hilarious.  The behind-the-scenes stuff is pretty cool to watch, and the episode quality is fantastic.  Love this set! <br /> <br />For those of you who haven't been fortunate enough to see it, I'd still encourage you to get this collection.  I've introduced six of my friends to this show, two of whom said they hated all things sci-fi before seeing it, and all are now thoroughly addicted.  The acting is wonderful, the mixture of humor and drama is brilliant, the special effects are breathtaking, and the story arcs are epic and interesting.  You will be hooked!
B00097DX3U|5.0|When this album came out, I had to get it as soon as could. I was so excited when i bought this cd. Once I played it a few times, I was just as blown away as when I heard the debut album. This album does require a couple hearings before you fall in love with it though. But when it sinks in it is EXCELLENT! Audioslave is really heading in the right direction.    1. YOUR TIME HAS COME : Another great openner for an album by the band. As everyone says, the riff is a bit similar to the riff in chochise, but that does not take away the greatness from the song. If you like audioslave at all, you will love this song. Typical of the band, but still manages to amaze. Also was a hit single.  10/10    2. OUT OF EXILE : So here's the title track. The pounding drum intro is totally awesome, and once Tom's very rage'ish riff comes in and really rocks you hard. Chris yells the chorus in this song so well too, and just makes this song a quick favorite.   10/10    3. BE YOURSELF : So here's another single off the album, and a great one. It's more mellow than the previous songs but is still top notch material. Great lyrics by Cornell. The chorus is very chatchy and will have you singing along.  10/10    4. DOESN'T REMIND ME : This is definatley the biggfest hit on the album. Personally, I'm not sure why. Don't get me wrong, I love this song. I really do. BUT there are many songs on this album that are better, which I would have picked for the biggest hit. Still a sweet song though, with a happy, peaceful, feel to it.   10/10    5. DROWN ME SLOWLY : Awesome tune! Very heavy. Chris sings it great too (ovcoarse). You'll find yourself banging your head to this song every time you hear it.  10/10    6. HEAVEN'S DEAD : Now, people say that this is the bore fest of the album. I disagree greatly. I think this is a beautiful soothing song. The chorus is fantastic, and Chris sings it with great emotion.  10/10    7. THE WORM : Unbelievable! This song hits you like a ton of bricks! Right when you listen to it you will be left with your draw dropped and your eyes buldging from your head. This song does have a similar feel to led zeppelin's black dog as i also read in other reviews. Anyway, Tom is using all different effects on this song. His guitar work on this is outstanding! The solo. Oh, yes the solo. The solo in this song is the most amazing thing i've ever heard. It screeches so high, and then he goes higher and higher until it basically melts your ears. Amazing song!  10/10    8. MAN OR ANIMAL : This is a rage'ish sounding song that doesn't really do it for me. It's good though. I really don't know why, I never liked it too much. It's just average to me.  8/10    9. YESTERDAY TO TOMMORROW : The bass intro to this song is really awesome but unfortunatley I usually skip this one. This is a bit of a boreing song it seems to me. Not enough \\"uumf\\" in it. If you know what I mean. Just bland.  7/10    10. DANDELION : Here we go! Back on track now! This song is so great. Listen to this on a nice sunny day, and you will just be in another world. Such a peaceful, happy song. When I listen to this my mind just seems to go soaring through the clouds, feeling the sun, and being so peaceful. Great lyrics. Great chorus. Possibly Chris's best vocal performance on the album as well.  10/10    11. #1 ZERO : This song requires a couple listens before you like it, but after a couple listens for me I now love it! Definately one of the best songs on the album. It just has such a cool, low beat and groove. Great vocals by Cornell. Towards the middle of the song it picks up the pace and becomes heavy! This carries the song incredibly to the end which starts to slow down again and leaves you wanting more. Also one of the best solos on the album.  10/10    12. THE CURSE : Here's another song that you need to give a chance. This is easily one of my very favorites on the album. The lyrics and vocals on this song are fantastic. For me, whats so great about this song is the chorus. I'm constantly singing along, and it's song with great emotion and effort by Cornell. Great soloing by Tom, which leads into a softer chorus by sung beautifly by Cornell. Outstanding! What a way to close the album and leave your jaw dropped again!  10/10    If you thought the first album was great, wait until you hear this masterpiece. Equally as good as the first.

B00006EXL5|1.0|The review below me says that MCR isnt mainstream. Wow now thats the mark of a uninformed person. Not only is MCR SUPEMELEY mainstream, but emo is just that...MAINSTREAM. Emo sells records, thats it. Remember if enough girls scream for your band, you will be big no matter how much you suck.
B00005JO1J|1.0|The movie Rent is definitely a movie to see if your an adult. Its' mature theme limits the wide audience. It was well done from the stand point of having the original cast, 6 months pre-production, boldness, electricifying performances, and punts. On the other hand, the movie lacked a sense of wholeness. Almost like following through a music video without any script. Even when script was added to it, they used punts, funny but not necessary. This is a serious theme of AIDS and 1990's. I didn't even know that ATZ is a AIDS mediaction, until I thought about it. It was sort of vague, although, I did watch a film about aids and their incapable of paying rent. The end of the movie, made you wanted more... to complete the movie's message to take like everyday as today, not tomorrow. I think this rave on aids is more suited on broadway, not films.
B000B5XOXY|2.0|By now, \\"Batman Forever\\" is officially regarded as the beginning of the end of the original Batman series. After two successful entries with director Tim Burton, Warner Brothers started to change the whole direction of the franchise by firing Burton (because of a bunch of whiny parents complaining that \\"Batman Returns\\" was too dark for young children, which in all fairness it was, but still...) and hiring Joel Schumacher. Now, initially, this wasn't a bad idea. Though not as innovative as Burton, Schumacher still had a fairly impressive body of work, including \\"The Lost Boys\\", \\"Flatliners\\" and \\"Falling Down\\". The cast chosen for the film was also looking good when it was announced. Val Kilmer seemed to be a worthy successor to Michael Keaton, Tommy Lee Jones was a good if not great choice for Two-Face (Ray Liotta was the first choice for the role, but he was already doing \\"Unlawful Entry\\"), Jim Carrey was a good fit for The Riddler (Robin Williams and Brad Dourif were considered when Michael Keaton was still attached to the project) and Nicole Kidman would make an incredibly sexy love interest (Rene Russo was originally going to do her part when Keaton was attached). The only complaint came from the casting of Chris O'Donnell for the role of Robin, who was deemed to old for the role (Leonardo DiCaprio and future Batman Christian Bale both auditioned for the role). Other than that, \\"Batman Forever\\" seemed like it would be a good film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film failed to deliver. The film has a lot of potential, but that potential is drowned in a sea of neon lights and cheesy one liners. The characters were done all wrong. While Burton's versions of the characters weren't entirely faithful to the comic books either, the overall personas of the characters was kept. Here, however, they are done nothing like the comic book versions. Two-Face is one of the calmest, most intelligent and most tragic characters in the Batman comics. Here, however, he's done as a stupid Joker ripoff. The Riddler was a very low key, cold and calculating character in the comics, but he to is no more than a two bit rip off The Joker. Nicole Kidman is left to carry the deadweight as Dr. Chase Meridean. Her performance is adequate and she looks hot (she's the second hottest Bat-babe next to Pfeiffer), but she is wasted in her role. Val Kilmer is normally a very good actor, but as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, he is utterly stiff and uninteresting.<br /><br />10 years later, the film is now out on a two disc special edition dvd, like all the other films in the series. The film has grown on me a bit, but not much. It's the extras that make this dvd a keeper. Though not as good as the ones on \\"Batman\\" or \\"Batman Returns\\", the extras are very entertaining and are what makes this dvd worthy of owning.<br /><br />So while the film is bad, the extras make it a good buy. And who knows? You might actually like the film. To each his own.tupid Joker ripoff.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|When Tim Burton's 1989 classic \\"Batman\\" was released on dvd back in the late 1990s', I think that it's safe to say that its fans were more than a little disappointed. The packaging was shoddy, there were no bonus features, and sound and picture quality was average at best.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2005, With the success of Christopher Nolan's reboot \\"Batman Begins\\", interest in the old series has been revived. Picking up on this, Warner Brothers has finally released the original 1989 blockbuster (as well as its three sequels, which vary in quality) on special edition dvd, complete with a second disc filled with bonus features.<br /><br />Most reviewers have already gone over the plot and other aspects of the film (such as Jack Nicholson's amazing performance as The Joker), so I'm going to jump straight into the second disc. I can only say one word...WOW! There is a ton of stuff loaded on this dvd. The first disc features an entertaining commentary track by Burton himself. It is insightful, informative and at times hilarious, but never annoying like some reviewers say it is. But the second disc is where all the goodies lie. There are featurettes going over every aspect of the Dark Knight's journey from the pages of DC Comics to cinemas across the world. The interviews are all very enjoyable. I was really glad that Jack Nicholson participated, since he isn't really a big fan of interviews. His comments are a joy to watch. He to this day loves to have been a part the film, and it shows. He even wears a purple shirt and a Batman pin to prove it.<br /><br />I can go on and on and on about how awesome this dvd, but I'm just gonna sya that this is one dvd that belongs in your collection (alogn with the other four Batman films, which are all available on two disc special edition dvds as of October 18th, 2005). It is one you will want to reach for over and over again.
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Neil Young, Prairie Wind<br /><br />Neil Young shares what he values in Prairie Wind, taking us on a poetic tour of his southern homelands, from songs reflecting on life's dreams like \\"The Painter\\" to fond memories of Elvis in \\"He Was The King.\\" Aptly named, the album starts and ends with the sounds of the prairie winds, and Young's Nashville musical roots are emphasized throughout the album by the use of traditional instruments like the pedal steel, fiddle, harmonica, and Hammond B3 Organ.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|The last time Batman was seen on the silver screen, his suit had nipples, the Batmobile was shaped like a giant male sex organ, and he and his foes (including Arnold Schwarzenegger in a gigantic steel suit) were spouting out cheesy one liners that approached a level of stupidity not even reached in the campy 1960s' tv series.<br /><br />Shocked by the stunningly bad treatment of this classic character, critically acclaimed director Christopher Nolan and comic book fan David Goyer (who wrote the \\"Blade\\" films) joined forces to write \\"Batman Begins\\". Unlike the films of the previous series (event the Tim Burton films, which were excellent and are still my favorites), this one was to be faithful to the source material and show the true origins of the Dark Knight.<br /><br />And man does it ever. \\"Batman Begins\\" take you back - way back -to Bruce Wayne's origins. Tormented by the sight of his parents' murder as a child, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) goes on a journey to find himself. He winds up in an Asian prison, where he is found by the mysterious Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who works for a secret organization known as the Leauge Of Shadows. There Bruce learns how to concquer his fears through strength and discipline. However, he soon learns that the Leauge are not all that it's cracked up to be, and he eludes them and returns to Gotham City. There, he is awaited by his trusted and loving butler Alfred (Michael Caine, perfectly cast) and his childfriend Rachel Dawes (a miscast Katie Holmes). He learns that Wayne Enterprises, the corporation his father started to help Gotham City has been taken over by sleazy business mogul Richard Eearle (Rutger Hauer, c'mon, you remember him). With the help of Alfred and outcast Wayne Enterprises ally Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman, again perfectly cast), he adopts a new persona, a vengeful vigilante who uses his fear of bats to strike fear into the hearts of others. He becomes...Batman. And that's where the fun begins. He becomes allies with Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, once again perfectly cast), one of Gotham's only good cops). With his help, he must take down the sinister Dr. Jonathan Crane (the creepy Cillian Murphy, who was awesome), aka Scarecrow, who plans to poison Gotham City with his fear gas. There's nonstop action mixed in with an incredibly well written plot that amounts to the best Batman movie in nearly 15 years.<br /><br />All in all, this film is excellent. The cast is perfect for the most part. Christian Bale makes for a great Batman and Bruce Wayne. He does just as good as Michael Keaton, but he also adds an edge to the role not scene before. Michael Caine brings the role of Alfred to life, as does Gary Oldman with Jim Gordon. In the previous franchise, these characters weren't given proper treatment. I didn't mind, but it's nice to see them finally get the respect they deserve. Neeson is excellent as Ducard, who wasn't actually a villian in the comics. He is extremely low key and very creepy. Freeman is excellent as Fox. In the comics, Fox was a pretty minor character, but Freeman makes the character very accesssible and thus the character is put to good use. Cillian Murphy was fantastic as The Scarecrow. He owned the part. Tom Wilkinson even pops up for a great cameo as crime boss Carmine Falcone. Katie Holmes, as I said earlier, was extremely miscast. She just wasn't able to hold her own against the film's other stars.<br /><br />The extras on the second disc are great, but the menu takes a while to navigate. I liked the comic book, too. Definitely a must see movie.llies with Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, once again perfectly cast), one of Gotham's only good cops).

B000AGTPUK|5.0|I'm not even done watching this movie and I absolutely love it. This movie is all about that meloncholy time in a child's life where they fall into the chasm between innocent childhood and cynical \\"growing up\\" and the beauty of finding out it's still possible to believe in magic. As Santa says in the end... \\"The true spirit of Christmas lies in your heart\\".   <br /> <br />Even though this movie is about Christmas, it is not a singularly religious film (a well-placed Jewish elf makes that clear) and it's not sappy, sweet,  stuff ...I love the \\"angel\\" train hobo, the mafia-esque video-monitoring elves and the \\"blue-collar\\" style elves in charge of the presents. <br /> <br />Ohh, this is just a beautiful story turned into a beautiful film and a new classic in our family from this point on. I cried at the end and was just so grateful that my kids can grow up knowing the true spirit of Christmas, which this movie helps teach.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Like his 1989 original, Tim Burton's 1992 follow up 1989 classic \\"Batman\\", \\"Batman Returns\\" (whic is in my opinion, the superior film), has been released on a two disc special edition dvd, with the second disc filled with extras. Since this is my favorite out of all the Batman films, I'm really excited about this.<br /><br />Most reviewers have already gone into plot details, so much like my review for the first film, I will go into detail about the extras. Like the first film, all I can say is...WOW! The extras are even better than the first one. There's the vintage 1992 documentary \\"The Bat, The Cat & The Penguin\\" hosted by Robert Urich (though it wasn't, sadly, what I expected it to be, which was an all new interview with the cast). But there a bunch of new featurettes loaded with all new interviews, not to mention another great commentary by Burton. Plus, there's the unforgettable music video for Siouxsie And The Banshees' \\"Face To Face\\". I'm sorry to all the fans of Prince's \\"Batdance\\", but this is the quintessential song from a Batman movie.<br /><br />The sound and picture quality are, like the first film, excellent. \\"Batman Returns\\" is a film that you must have in your dvd collection. You won't regret it.
B000AGTPUK|1.0|The fact that every character was cross-eyed totally ruined this movie for me.  I can't comment on any other aspect of the film because I was constantly distracted by those eyes.  At first I thought it was my imagination, but after looking closely (and constantly), I confirmed that one pupil was not aligned like the other.  I can't believe that someone like Robert Zemeckis could allow such inferior animation to be released.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Again after his fabriclive Jacques Lu Cont (Thin White Duke) shows us what quality of sound is meant to be. The 21 year old genious, an english man despite the name, produced this dj like album without loosing its popish nature. Madonnas first target for this album would be the middle age gay community, maybe this is why the first single includes an abba sample which i think ruins the whole Lu Cont intention. The sound of the album itself is outstanding but the album lacks a meaning. I mean if you are giving us \\"confessions\\" try the new york lyrics. Very deep. If the intention was to make people jump off their seats, I think \\"Hung up\\" will do the job, indeed I think this single will be overplayed in every single club around the globe. So with a little time it might become too much.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|When it comes to pop music and Madonna in one room together, you could do no wrong. <br />Over the period of nearly 25 years, Madonna has crafted some of pop music's greatest gems. Selling over 200 million albums and Amazon's top seller for nearly 2 months before the record release to boot. It's a little tough arguing with those figures. You can't sell as much as Madonna has by having only a core fanbase. Madonna is genius of appealing to the public. <br />Of course this includes working with great talent. But not in the typical form of some rapper (Mariah and Gwen anyone???)  <br /> <br />This time hand in hand with dj Stuart Price, Madonna takes a turn to her past songwriting methods with catchy melody and hooks. Madonna may have become \\"artiste\\" on us over the years which puts many listeners off. Coming back to form would mean facing what one is really gifted at. And pop music is what Madonna does best and with this album she means business. <br />Together Madonna and Stuart move dance music forward giving a darker and futuristic vibe to it, making it less colorful and chirpy as what is normally detected in dance music. <br /> <br />The lyrics are nothing to brag about but the genius of Madonna is that she knows that good dance music doesn't make one ponder in the middle of a dance. It doesn't mean that the lyrics are senseless, just not complex. After all who needs a science experiment on a dancefloor. She never tried to be Bob Dylan so why critisize her for it now? We bashed her enough for the seriousness behind American Life, let's not get hypocritical. <br /> <br />Hung Up the lead single is Madonna's new worldwide smash. Her 11th UK number one and crawling towards the top ten on the American Hot 100 in a youth/hip-hop dominated market is not too shabby for a 47 year old mother of 2. Madonna has defied ageism despite cheeky comments in the press, and is an inspiration to the North American public consumed by messages of youth and vitalism. Madonna demonstrates that it's not multiple plastic surgeries, implants and other unnatural forms of youthism that makes one young. It's good diet/exercise and maybe her ambition which has drove her career past Britney before she could even start. This is a woman who has fallen off a horse, and literally weeks later was up and around promoting her album, including awesome dance moves. <br /> <br />Let her inspire you through this album, through her career. Through her.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JOHI|5.0|I was cativated by this movie.  After watching the mini-series with Colin Firth, I didn't think a remake could come close to it.  I was wrong.  This movie had my attention from beginning to end.  Yes, you can turn a five hour mini-series into a two hour movie without losing anything.  The chemistry between Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen brought a new freshness to Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy.  I still can't get enough of it even after seeing it five times.  I can't wait to add it to my Pride and Predjuice collection.  But until then, I just be content with seeing it 10 or 15 more times at least.
B000AP04NI|1.0|Before we look at OKLAHOMA! let's have a look at Fox's track record for presenting vintage roadshow musicals on DVD...   the abysmal hack job Fox did on the STAR! DVD is well documented elsewhere... The star billing on the DOCTOR DOLITTLE DVD is a big enough mistake to make Mr. Harrison's estate remind Fox about his contract. The credit block on the the tacky cover of the HELLO, DOLLY! DVD claims the film was ...\\"produced BY Todd-AO.\\"  Todd-AO is a 70mm widescreen film format, but some ignorant Foxer changed the credit from \\"Produced IN Todd-AO\\" because they were clueless, and an equally clueless Fox Homevid Exec approved it.    Obviously these people have NO clue about these older films, and that ignorance continued with the subesequent release of OKLAHOMA!.    This new set includes two featurettes explaining the virtues of the TODD-AO format, which debuted with OKLAHOMA!  But no one at Fox managed to connect the dots to realize that the 70mm TODD-AO version of OKLAHOMA! is the superior, preferred version of the film, and that the 35mm CinemaScope version is a lower quality second choice.    Originally TODD-AO was shot at 30 frames per second, while regular films run at 24fps.  Since most theatres wouldn't be able to install new equipment to show OKLAHOMA in 70mm at 30fps, OKLAHOMA! was shot in BOTH formats, releasing primarily in 70mm TODD-AO, then using the 35mm CinemaScope version for the cheaper sub-runs.  Therefore the 70mm TODD-AO version should be the featured version on DVD, given plenty of space on Disc One to showcase all the extra detail that 30fps 70mm contains.  The 35mm CinemaScope version should have been squeezed onto disc two as a supplement.        How do these people get their jobs and keep them after so many obvious snafus?  Did some kid at Fox think the Scope version was superior because it is \\"wider?\\" - not really true - the Todd-AO version is taller and has MORE picture info than the 35mm.   After OKLAHOMA! and AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS, TODD-AO began to shoot at 24 fps, allowing a 35mm scope version to be extracted by cropping off the top and bottom of the original picture.  So any film originating in 70mm is going to show less picture in the cropped 35mm scope version.  But how are the Children of the Fox to know this when they refuse to ask or listen to anyone who knows?      There aren't a lot of people on Fox Video's current payroll who really know much about these films,  There are numerous websites used by film buffs who know these movies, but the Fox Video dept. don't believe in consulting their audience.  They have the arrogance of ownership (\\"it's THEIR film\\") but they forget that they are asking for OUR money.  As one Fox Video Exec said \\"the fanatics will buy it anyway.\\"    Warner Home Video actually employs at least one full time person who knows what he is doing with older films.  Fox does not.  Their catalog titles suffer as a result.  The only language they understand is dollars, but even if the badly produced titles don't sell, they aren't likely to connect the low sales to their own mistakes.       I cannot recommend that people support this shoddy product with their dollars, only to buy it again a couple years later when a newer version comes out.  I plan to rent the supplemental disc to watch the extras, and save my money until Fox hires people who know the product and do it right.  Not holding my breath, though.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|SOAD after 4 yrs is just like hot coffee in a cold day & it tastes wonderful for sure.It just feels good to hear all the screaming shouting etc.In this album SOAD have gone a bit melodic in nature. With all the hard shouting they do the melodic content makes me like the songs even more better than previous albums & that to the chorus in most songs are damn good.As long there will be original music,people will always support u guys & one of them is me.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Great movie! It's the first time I've been in a movie theatre and everyone stood up and clapped at the end of the movie! Now that says it all right there!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|what can i say thats not already been said, there is no stopping this lady. i loved american life, and never understood why it was classed as a failure for selling 5 million units worldwide. most artists would cut their arm off for sales like that. i suppose its because when you are the biggest selling female artist of all time, that this was classed as a failure... but hold on, whats that you say, 4 million sales of this album in its first week of release...yep thats 4 million. ;. <br />remember when erotica came out and the press slated her, remember how she got her stuff together and had goldon globes, grammies and uk hall of fame awards...well never underestimate the power of madonna....  <br /> <br />confessions is one hell of a album, it matches her re-invention tour, her live8 tour de force and trust me i was lucky enough to be at both of them.. the songs make you remember why she has been unreachable at the top of her game for 23 years. so lets examine confessions and hail the return of pop music. <br /> <br />hung up, the abba sample works a treat, even benny and bjorn love it, the beat and layers of sounds make it sound like its different each play, her most catchy dance stuff since ray of light. <br /> <br />get together,another call to the dancefloor, which gradually gets faster and faster and leaves you bopping around the lounge. <br /> <br />sorry, trust me when this comes out early 2006, you will see the album sell more and more, her express yourself for the 2000,s..this is awesome, and her voice is so sexy with the different accents.  <br /> <br />future lovers, this is the purest gay tribute in years, very donna summer/pet shop boys and yet it sounds fresh. <br /> <br />i love new york, ray of light style track, that grows on you, no doubt it will be used in tourist board adds in the months to come. <br /> <br />let it will be, great dance music, great lyrics and awesome vocals. <br /> <br />forbidden love, this is nice, sweet. <br /> <br />jump, this has got to be released, its blinding..its destined to hit the number one spot internationally. <br /> <br />how high, this is perhaps my least favourite track, maybe it will grow on me. <br /> <br />isaac, this is very very classy, beautifull strings, beautifull vocals and a dreamscape of a song...wheres my turkish delight. <br /> <br />push, very fast vocals, almost like shes rapping, a grower. <br /> <br />and finally the best track on the cd.....like it or not... this rocks, its madonna at her best, being truthfull, being honest and saying it as it is...very danceable and it gives me goosebumps when i hear it. i hope she releases it. <br /> <br />so there we go guys and gals, this album deserves the fanfare its getting.... and please dont slagg mariah off, i think her immature fans who posted stuff on here are giving her a bad time..shes not madonna and never will be..theres enough room for lesser artists.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of the more original movies of the year.  Screws with your head a bit, which I think is good.  A different take on the romantic drama (there isn't really that much to laugh about) and left me asking myself questions about my romantic memories, good and bad.  Highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|With the exception of Hung Up, this is the worst CD I have purchased in a long time.  Don't waste your money.
B00005JNTX|3.0|This movie gets all of its stars for its cinematography and none for the plot or characters.  Sin City is guilty of being too close to the comic books (which I have read) - this is a movie people, not comic book.  People expect development.  HOWEVER, once again, cheers for an extremely visually stimulating experience and some priceless shots.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|System Of a Down have come to a crossroad in their career. Its clear and its evident, hence the twin album release. Is it a band at odds with their own identity and options, or a band at odds with each other. Im not sure, maybe both.     With the release of Mesmerize, SOAD soared into a world unbeknown to them. Respected critics declared it a fantastic. Genuine tributes normally reserved for groups like radiohead, modest mouse, interpol ETC were finding their way to SOAD. Mesmerize sounded like a complete album... cultural, atmospheric,   unscripted, devoid of generic formula, and very passionate. Characteristics of mostly indie music. Some kids will confuse genuine praise as a form of commercialism (MTV hype). But its far from it and I didnt see much of SOAd on commerical radio. SOAD is growing up, they a ridding themselves of teen angst, and turning their energy to smart expansive sounds rather than one dimensional pourings that are synonomous with true commerical Nu metal garbage you see on MTV. Including Green DAy who refuse to grow up and expand their music rather than political stance.     So they are treading on minefields literally. Anti-commericalists     finding widespread success. But their success is righteous. They have entered the adult market, and I for one welcome them.     So what do they do. Allow themselves to transcend to greater heights, knowing that they will lose a well established fan base. OR stick to what they had been doing pre-2005.    I tell you what shouldnt happen... Hypnotize.  If anything, its a symbolic product of where they are at this point in time. On the knife's edge. The album twists and turns between two mediums. A deliberate melodic freeform sound that is uncategorizable Vs pointless angst with generic tones and gestures of straight up hardcore punkish metal.   It serves to disappoint both sides of the table.    They need to make a decision where they are going.   I have a feeling Daron wants angst, Serj wants substance.
B0007CNXUK|2.0|This movie was not particularly watchable for me.  The acting is great by the leads, but the whole concept of \\"the real story, only with some facts changed\\" as well as the whole magical realism feel to it just did not appeal to me.  Sorry, can't recommend this.

I hated Darcy Rhone as much I hated Darcy Rhone but as I flipping the pages I became mellowed, Darcy Rhone wasn't that bad after all, though I still think her as self-centered. I couldn't agree more with Ethan.. after all he made her realised her priorities and her mistakes along the way. Ethan suits her fine. I just love books with happy endings. sighh..
B000E1YVZU|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Rent; I think it's the best American musical ever made and it's up there with the best in the world. I was lucky to see the original production in New York, and I've seen many other excellent national stage productions. I've been waiting ten years for the movie. What I got was a Hollywood version that was hit and miss. It's another great musical, like Phantom of the Opera, that I regretfully won't be adding to my movie collection.<br /><br />Let me say what I liked first. With the exception of Rosario Dawson as Mimi, all of the original cast was there, and Dawson was fine. Some of the scenes were fantastic: the opening street scene with fires burning everywhere and the cast singing the frenetic and galvanizing title song; Mark and Joanne's tango of despair; Angel and Collins singing Santa Fe on the subway; Maureen's Over the Moon performance was a riot; the Mad Hatter's dinner at the Life Cafe was suitably bohemian.<br /><br />Now what I didn't like. Even with the occasional brilliance of certain scenes, the story and the characters had little chemistry or edginess; it pales in comparison to the stage show. The music is sung and played to perfection, but studio musicians have taken away its soul. Many of the segues between scenes and songs are terrible; some of them are just blackouts. Dialogue that sounds good sung sounds stilted unsung. Some major songs are missing. Other songs have been changed, for example, Mimi's signature song, Out Tonight, is performed in a strip club, reminding me of Flashdance, and there was no moondust in her hair! In Angel and Collins' love song, I'll Cover You, you can almost hear the director shouting for them not to get too affectionate with each other, perhaps to keep a PG-13 rating. Benny looked uncomfortable in his role, and you'd never know he was a bohemian at heart turned yuppie who eventually finds his way back. If one more person had laughed hysterically over Maureen turning lesbian, I swear I would have screamed. And almost acting as a coup de grace was the elaborate and farcical commitment ceremony between Joanne and Maureen which included their breakup song Take Me or Leave Me.<br /><br />Please see this movie, especially if you've never seen the stage show. But if the movie doesn't thrill you, please note that the stage production is a whole lot better, and try to see it if at all possible. And if the movie does thrill you, then see the stage show anyway - you'll like it even better!t acting as a coup de grace was the elaborate and farcical commitment ceremony between Joanne and Maureen which included their breakup song Take Me or Leave Me.

B00003CXAT|4.0|It has been told so many times: we have withdrawn so far from Mother Nature that we tend to forget it. So, intrenched in our own modern Trojan world, we are trapped in our words `s jungle: even we dare to believe in certain imported mind terms with such strong that we use to think they exist.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is in last instance, the tempting Pandora `s box, the final choice and golden opportunity to recreate thanks our undeniable genetic advance, a part of the lost world in the night of the times, in our ancestral genes and the minutely investigation of scientists, investigators and Historians. Once more Michael Crichton  retook the ancient myth: to look behind , immersed in Orpheus punishment respect his wife,  Eurydice,  Lot `s woman in the Holy Scriptures and finally in Goethe `s Faust.<br /><br />The script is a bitter vision about the eternal and never satisfied love for the knowledge, to challenge the question: what if I ... ?  The final result was an admirable exercise of vivid and unconscious terror respect our antipodes, the recreation of a primitive world; a entry through the tunnel of the time to experience the primordial fears with its logical consequences.<br /><br />Perhaps the film made no use of the mythical load immersed within this post modernist tale. Maybe this punch would have been extremely profitable to achieve a striking picture where entertainment, and humor would have shaken hands with the mythical experience.<br /><br />A splendid cast delineates a kinetic plot with the secure and accurate vision of this unbeatable entertainment 's wizard: Steven Spielberg.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|I cant describe how happy I am to finally see this version make to the collections. It was missing from Money for Nothing collection and Sultuns of swing collection (which was worse than MFN). <br /> <br />The only song I find missing from this collection is Money For nothing (Live from Knebworth '90) which is 100 times better than the studio one and IS NOT AVAILABLE ON CD IN THE WORLD. not even of the CD name given above.. WHY WHY WHY!!!  <br /> <br />I somehow have it in MP3 and guitar on this song feels even better than Sultans of Swing. (The studio one MFN is quite forgettable that way).
B00068CVJ4|5.0|When I picked up \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" by the Mars Volta, not only did I acquire a wonderful piece of music, but I also unknowingly entered the world of At the Drive-In. Intrigued by the thought of a hardcore version of the Mars Volta, I grabbed \\"Relationship of Command\\" last week. What I got shattered any expectations that I could possibly have dreamt of.    Sporting intensely melodic guitars, frantic drums, driving bass and shrieking, shouting, screaming, passionate, almighty vocals, \\"Relationship of Command\\" is the prototypical post-hardcore album. Cedric Bixler's voice is just plain awesome; the melody of the Mars Volta is present, and although both voices are amazing, this is TMV Cedric's evil twin.    The opening track, \\"Arcarsenal,\\" allows the listener a taste of what he is in for. \\"Beware! Beware!\\" shrieks Cedric, leading you to wonder if he will have any voice left to make good on his threat. Then with a drum role and a \\"Hey!\\", \\"Pattern Against User\\" proves that he does.    Tracks three through six can be envisioned as one long, loud epic. \\"One Armed Scissor\\" shows aboard a doomed space station, writing to a loved one back home with \\"jagged pulp sliced through my veins.\\" It ends quietly, allowing \\"Sleepwalk Capsules\\" to catch you by surprise with its sharp guitarwork and noisy, rap-inspired vocals. It's a hardcore ride to the end, until \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" reverts to a slow, rhythymic song that is more poetry than song. It's certainly a track to remember and one of the more jewel-y jewels of the album. Following the closing fractured screams, a heavy, slow guitar riff opens \\"Mannequin Republic,\\" another blistering hardcore feast.    \\"Enfilade\\" begins with a creepy ransom call and dives into a song reminiscent of the Mars Volta, right down to Cedric's watery, distorted vocals. \\"Rolodex Propaganda\\" features a chorus which is catchy as hell and Iggy Pop's background vocals, a nice foil against Cedric's shrieking yowls.     Track nine is \\"Quarantined.\\" \\"Quarantined\\" is both lovely and scary; it is one of the slowest songs on the album yet one of the most intense and nail-biting. It just plain pwn3z. Seriously, this is one hell of a song.    Track ten, \\"Cosmonaut,\\" takes you back to rapid and hardcore, and then \\"Non-zero Possibility\\" lowers you back to the ground with a sad, sombre song that is as close as it comes to a ballad. It's also as close as it comes to \\"f*cking awesome,\\" a category that nearly every song touches.    The first extra track, \\"Extracurricular,\\" opens with a guitar solo that inspired the same solo on the closing song of \\"De-Loused.\\"  It isquite good and distinctive for its lack of lyrics in the liner notes. The final cut and last bonus track, \\"Catacombs,\\" is excellent; both energetic and exhausted. As a listener, you, too, are exhausted by this point.    The entire CD is amazing; all tracks stand out equally except for, I think, tracks five and nine: \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" and \\"Quarantined.\\" The former, as I said, is reading poetry, and it is great. The latter, as I said, is untouchable, even by the high standards of the rest of the CD. \\"Quarantined\\" is...just listen to it, will ya? It's awesome. My only complaint is that it's too short. Haunting, angry, scary...it's all there. What a song.    And what an album. I can't recommend this enough to fans of...rock. Buy it.
0684800713|2.0|After reading \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" for my literature class and enjoying it immensely, I decided to pick up another one of Hemingway's works.  Unfortunately, I chose this one.  Through most of the novel, I was bored.  I felt like the characters were doing the same thing over and over again.  Let's go have a drink.  Now let's have dinner and walk around.  Let's go drink some more.  I just don't see how this novel warrants all the praise it has received.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Before I review Enya's CD, I'd like to wholeheartedly recommend Caroline Peyton's \\"Celtic Christmas Spirit\\" as a wonderful companion to any Enya CD. Peyton's vocals are as sweet and soaring as Enya's (they sound like sisters) and the songs on \\"Celtic Christma Spirit\\" are stunning--masterfully produced--and many are unique. It is by far my most favorite Christmas CD and any Enya fan will immediately fall in love with it.    That said:    There are few artists whose songs I can listen to repeatedly and not get tired of them. Enya is one. I've grown accustomed to enjoying every song on every CD and have marveled at her ability to create such a unique, heavenly, awe-inspiring sound. This new CD has many moments of beauty and grandeur but fewer than I had hoped. Some tracks are just a tad...monotonous. I nonetheless still enjoy them but find myself waiting for several of the songs to move in some stunning direction and...they don't quite get there. I've listened to the CD about ten times now and I must admit it grows on me with each listen. But I'm used to Enya's songs captivating me from the first listen--an incredible expectation, I know. My favorite song is the final one, \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart.\\" It is like a prayer, a rich, evocative, prayer. Her instrumental, \\"Drifting\\", is also quite powerful. \\"If I Could Be Where You Are\\" is very wistful, quiet, much like \\"May It Be,\\" and quite beautiful. So many of the other melodies are catchy in their own way and one feels good listening to them but don't seem to reach the heights Enya songs usually do. SHe has simply set the bar too high, perhaps even for  herself tomatch each time. I'm hoping over time I will find all the tracks to be pure gold, as has been the case in the past. But for now, I wait. I enjoy the CD, marvel at some of the tracks, and wait for the rest of them to measure up to the amazing standard Enya has set--and surpassed--so many times before.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I was a big fan of Batman when I was growing up (and Robin too), but I never could get into the movies. This is mostly because I didn't take a liking to the actors chosen to play Batman. This movie has excellent casting with some of my favorites actors, including Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. The storyline is pretty interesting. It shows how Bruce Wayne came to be Batman, starting with the death of his parents when he was a child.     Although I miss good old Robin, the truth is he was not a necessary character in this movie. When the movie was over, I was ready for the sequel, and I hope there is one. I highly recommend it.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2 is one of the first rock bands that turned me onto rock when I pretty much only listened to rap (I still like rap). I listen to this cd like everyday! It's full of energy and emotion that we can all relate to!, listen to this cd beginning to end! no matter if you're a hip hop fan or a classical music fan!, it's full of the energy we all need once and awhile! I'm telling you you need to hear this!
B000AA305M|2.0|I have been a diehard David Gray fan for about 5 years now; I started with the classic White Ladder, and my obsession has grown since then. I have purchased all albums that have come before and since that fabulous CD, although none stand out more than it does. Its been several years since DG has released anything new, and I was so excited when I heard a new album was on the way...until I heard it. I think it is WAY too over-produced, and it is almost a betrayal of the mellow, low-key sound that thousands of DG fans around the world have come to know, love, and depend on for years. By far, I think this album is his worst yet vocally, lyrically, and musically. I hope the classic DG sound I am so familiar with makes a resurgence on his next album. There are a couple songs that are pretty good in and of themselves, such as Aint No Love and The One I Love, and Nos Da Cariad is very beautiful and interesting. As a whole, tho, this album sounds very discordant and mismatched.
B000001FS3|5.0|This cd is one of the most honest, foreward, poetic, and musical cds ever!, I have admired this group for very good reasons!, they're honest on and off records, they sound like nothing else, the songs are timeless, Bono doesn't overdo it when he's singing like most R&b records!, and much much more!, they know what real people from the real world are feeling!, if you're tired of all the flashy hollywood trends like I am, check this cd out!!!, these songs will change your life and make you feel things the others just can't!
0743454537|5.0|Beautifully written and so timely. Every time you make a judgement of a character, the next chapter will be written from that character's point of view. You will find yourself relating to EVERY character in the book and emphathizing with each one.  <br />I loved this book. Aslo the 4 people I loaned it too loved it also. The best of Piccoult, so very clever.
B000001EAQ|3.0|Looking back on this album, 'Pop' ages much better then I expected it too.  Looking at this honestly though, it's a cd that's really only for fans of the band who are fimiliar with their previous work. <br /> <br />It was a piece that marked the high point of U2's electronica experimentation.  The problem I think it had was that 'Zooropa' (their previous EP) was so wildly disliked by their fans that anything other then a return to a more traditional U2 sound was deemed unacceptable right from the start.  I think 'Pop' came out before the stink of 'Zooropa' had completely worn off.  After that, the simple fact that it was just medicore and not a masterpiece killed it before 'Pop' could warm up to anyone. <br /> <br />Madonna, I think, found herself in a similar situation when 'American Life' completely flopped and now she's released 'Confessions on a Dance Floor.'  It's an album with a much similar sound but more polished and light-years better.  It'll be interesting to see how if 'Confessions' is recieved the same way 'Pop' was. <br /> <br />'Pop' is a terrific album and marks an interesting point in U2's career. It's a great grab for an avid fan.  For the more casual buyer, though, you'd be doing yourself a favor to stick to something that better captures their signature sound.  'Pop' would be a terrible way to introduce someone to a wonderful body of work.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|hypnotize is better than mesmerize. in fact, i think that this is the 2nd best album soad have ever put out. this coming from a fan who owns and regularly listens to all of their albums. <br /> <br />daron. he is the enigma soad hold. decent guitar player, few if any solos, yet sold riff writing. most people dont like his singing voice...uhh...i dont understand. darons voice isnt that bad, people. ever heard billy corgan sing? how about brian johnson, of ACDC? now THAT is bad singing. i'm not saying daron is better or as good as serj...no way. daron has a unique voice and this album (this and mesmerize, really) uses daron's voice perfectly-for hooks and melodies. serj is there for the wacky, signature delivery, daron is there to back up and get the song stuck in your head.  <br /> <br />case in point track two, dreaming. without daron's choruses, the song'd be one long relentless headache machine. but with the 'hate these thoughts i cant deny' catching your brain in a trap of melody, the song becomes a true gem. <br /> <br />attack rips your brain apart and is serj's tour de force, a great opener. the aforementioned dreaming is a soad classic. kill rock n' roll has the great line 'so i felt like the biggest A-something when i killed your rock and roll', hypnotize is the single and features a great lead riff. stealing society has a great, garage-rocky punk daron-led section loaded with smart lyrics and cool hooks. tentative sounds like sad statue2 with even more anti-war cries.  <br /> <br />u-fig is abound with raucous screams of 'who wants to come with me and melt in the sun!?!?', interspersed with very quiet mandolin-sounding sections. holy mountains is an epic rocker not unlike 'mind' from their self titled album, about a massacre in soad's native armenia. vicinity of obscenity may just be the wierdest song SOAD have ever done- terracotta pie anyone? that with disco-esque parts...wow. shes like heroin is my personal favorite. sure, daron isnt chris cornell...or serj. but this song would be terrible with serj singing it, face the facts. if this was done by any other band it'd be overserious and terribly depressing. but with darons sarcastic delivery and just random lyrics, it becomes an almost upbeat song. lonely day may be a little melodramatic-but its short and suits its purpose, as a lower-fi transition to the second soldier side. the first 2:30 is a decent, slower quite epic song, but the last minute is a goosebump-inducing reworking of the intro to mesmerize. <br /> <br />is it perfect? eh not really. but its damn good. both mesmerize and hypnotize together easily make the best album of the year, but seperately they both make short, witty great if nowhere near perfect albums. reccomended buy, only if you get mesmerize while you're at it.

B00005JNX0|4.0|My boyfriend and I were planning to see a movie. And me, childish as I am, I wanted too see an animation. My boyfriend is not too fond of them, but it was my time too pick the movie so I chose Madagascar. I had already seen some advertisements about it, but was not too sure if I would like it.  <br /> <br />The movie theatre was filled with kids, and mums and dads, and my boyfriend was looking more and more irritated. I was feeling a little bit guilty, I dragged him into to this. But from the first moment on I could see a huge smile on his face. And I was laughing out loud too. It is the funniest animation I have ever seen. Especially the word-jokes, something younger kids don't always understand I'm afraid, are hilarious. So don't think this is just something for children under the age of 18, because I'm 20 and I loved it.

076781326X|5.0|\\"Oliver!\\" is the musical version of Dickens' tale about an orphan in Olde England. Oliver is born in a miserable workhouse and eventually taken in by an old thief and his merry band of boys who train him to be a pick-pocket. He meets some memorable characters along the way: Ron Moody plays the infamous Fagin, the leader of the thieves, with sinister delight. Jack Wild (the Artful Dodger) steals all his scenes with his talent and charm. Mark Lester, as Oliver, is a little wooden but looks the part and is appealing. Oliver Reed is convincingly repellant as nasty villain Bill Sikes, and Shani Wallis is good as his girlfriend, Nancy, the street girl with a heart of gold.<br /><br />Lionel Bart's music for \\"Oliver!\\" is absolutely enchanting. Each song is memorable and the big production numbers are a joy to behold. As the Artful Dodger welcomes Oliver to London with \\"Consider Yourself,\\" and the street vendors sing the beautiful, \\"Who Will Buy?\\", you are swept away into a magical world. \\"You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two\\" and \\"Reviewing the Situation\\" are Fagin's comic numbers that make you like him in spite of himself. \\"Oliver!\\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1968. Heartily recommended for the whole family.<br /><br />Kona
B000003B6J|5.0|Take you back to 1988 when hip-hop was almost entirely a NY element.  Then comes in the vulgar, dirty and harsh lyrics and world of 4 young men from Compton, who changed the way rap music went from this point forward.  Very controversial and something new, you knew this would create some buzz, and the Parental Advisory sticker became almost commonplace on rap album because of this album.  With the controversy you knew would come sales, as this sold over 2 million copies (probably much more by now) and brought the street to the suburbs and country side.  With 13 songs, 3 are classic, 3 are almost classics, 1 I skip, 1 is ok and the other 5 are good or great songs.  Eazy E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre and MC Ren (with some production help form Yella and songwriting by the D.O.C.) they bring the first great street rap album alive.  As I said Yella with Dr. Dre bring some great production for a 1988 album.  A must have gangsta rap album for everyone to own.    #1 - 10 (CLASSIC -- Eazy E, Ice Cube, MC Ren -- an ode to Compton -- tight beat)  #2 - 10 (CLASSIC -- Eazy E, MC Ren, Ice Cube -- tight beat -- like the songs says F**K tha Police\\")  #3 - 9.5 (Ice Cube & Eazy E)  #4 - 10 (CLASSIC -- MC REn -- great beat)  #5 - 9.5 (D.O.C., Dr. Dre, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Eazy E -- tight beat)  #6 - 9.5 (Eazy E -- tight beat --a bout his 40 oz.)  #7 - 8.5 (Dr Dre & MC REn -- nice beat)  #8 - 9 (MC Ren)  #9 - 8 (Dr Dre & MC REn)  #10 - 9 (ICe Cube -- about not letting a h0 play you)  #11 - 9 (Ice Cube --a bout teh Dopeman)  #12 - 7 (MC Ren)  #13 - 3 (Eazy E, MC REn & Dr. Dre -- has dance music??)

B0000039PW|5.0|Biggie drops it hard and releases a Classic rap album here for his debut. A good amount of these were killing the radio in 94 and 95 (and still in 05). After this he became crowned the King of the East, the east came back toward the top and the East/West hyped from the media feud, and thus his feud with old homie 2Pac \\"King of the West\\" began and lead to the death of them both. With 15 songs, 3 are classic, 3 are almost classic, 1 is ok and the other 8 are good or great. Guests are minimal, rapping on 1 song and doing a couple hooks. Production is nice as well. Easy MO Bee does 5 songs, Chuckey Thompson does 3, Puff Daddy does 2, Domenic Owens & Kevin Scott, Norman & Digga, Poke of Trackmasters, DJ Premier, Lord Finesse all do 1 song. Just listenig to the first few track you can sense his expertise in lyricism, and tell he knows how to tell astory to make you feel as though you're in it.

B000BEZPQE|5.0|I just bought this album last week, burned it into my MiniDisc player and listen to it every day... and it gets better every single time. The fake \\"... Slipknot will not be performing this evening..\\" intro was really funny, and when \\"The Blister Exists\\" came in I was overwhelmed by it's power riffs. When they came to venezuela on sept. 20th during the Subliminal Verses Tour the sound was not very good, so I wanted to know how the new songs really sounded like with a good production; here's my review: <br /> <br />THE GOOD: The new songs are raspier and stronger than the originals from the SV album. The energy that derived from Corey is noticeable in every track, specially on \\"The Blister Exists\\", \\"Duality\\", \\"Get This\\", \\"Before I forget\\" (the best song from SV), \\"Disasterpiece\\" and \\"Liberate\\". The guitar riffs were AWESOME!!. <br /> <br />THE BAD: Corey's voice was not as dark and powerful as it was on \\"Disasterpieces\\". On some tracks he sounded tired and angry because he (I suppose) could not reach the top of his voice he knows he can reach. Joey's drumming was merely average through the whole 2 albums, while Syd's DJ'ing was somewhat lost.  <br /> <br />THE UGLY: They did not play \\"Gently\\" wich is one of my favorites and should be a must in every concert. <br /> <br />This is an excelent album and a must have for every maggot out there. After the venezuelan gig I became a bigger fan and I hope to see'em again. <br />
B000B5IPLK|5.0|Admittingly, being an Alicia Keys fan, it's hard to be a objective, but in all honestly, this Unplugged Album shows why Keys is one of the most critically acclaimed and popular artists of our time. <br /> <br />On this concert Keys sings her heart out, as shown on this disc during the soulful \\"How Come You Don't Call Me\\" and tear-jerking \\"If I Ain't Got You.\\" She shows her great piano playing skills. She performs her own written music, some composed at the young age of 14 yet sound as good as songs written by people in their 30s \\"Butterflyz\\" and \\"Goodbye\\". She takes classic covers like \\"If I Was Your Woman\\" and \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\" and makes them her own. She's versatile, able to range from jazz and funk \\"Karma/Heartburn\\" to slow, seductive, RnB \\"Diary\\" to upbeat Hip-Hop \\"Love it or Leave it Alone.\\" <br /> <br />What's great about this concert is that it allows Keys to demonstrate all of her skills, and there are many of them. She can almost do everything that she sets her mind to, barring re-arranging some live songs. \\"A Woman's Worth\\" and \\"Fallin'\\" fall flat on this album, not because they're performed poorly, but because the arrangements are unnecessarily tampered with. However, the bonus unreleased songs \\"Unbreakable,\\" \\"Streets of New York,\\" and \\"Stolen Moments\\" more than make up for those minor missteps and overall make this album an extremely pleasing concert to both listen to and watch.
0307263118|5.0|The events in this short novel are tragic but the language is beautiful, by turns mischievously opaque and astonishingly clear. I rarely mark up books, but I underlined many sentences and passages in this one, just for the sheer pleasure of rereading them later. And for all the talk that The Sea foregoes traditional plot structure, it nonetheless builds to a satisfying and surprising conclusion. When, towards the end, Max describes himself as being \\"in the historic present,\\" he has earned the oxymoron, having established the past and present as fluid and nearly synonymous. This is a fantastic book.
B000BB1MHS|2.0|i hated this movie! me and my friend couldnt finish watching it. i thought it was bad. i loved the original. this 1 was too weird. it had a couple good parts but no that many. the oompa loopa songs were not the same. oompa loopmas were not the same. the were not orange with green hair. wat was up with that!! i def would not suggest this to any of my friends or any lovers of the original!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Let's get one thing clear -- John Mayer is no Buddy Guy or Stevie Ray Vaughan.  They have both done what he's doing much better.  That said, this is a HUGE improvement over all the fluffy pap he's put out in the past.  He doesn't sing like a Dave Matthews wannabe anymore. Now he's leaning more towards SRV. This is without a doubt his crowning achievement thus far, and if this really is to be viewed as a new beginning for John, we very well may have even better things to hear in the future. <br /> <br />Check out \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" -- it's a straight reading of Jimi Hendrix's original, and it's quite a respectable version. And the groove that Pino Palladino and Steve Jordan create on \\"I Got A Woman\\" is quite refreshing and fun. And \\"Who Did You Think I Was\\" is so defiant in its repudiation of the past, you've got to at least respect it if you can't love it. And \\"Try\\" just flat-out rocks.  <br /> <br />I never thought I'd say it, but I'm actually looking forward to John's next record, which should also be a Trio recording. These are the kinds of surprises that keep me excited about new music, like when Dylan broke his dry spell with Time Out Of Mind or when Radiohead dove head-first into avant garde electronic art rock with Kid A. Granted, this record isn't as substantive as either of those two, but the spirit and energy involved is definitely on par. Give the guy some credit -- he's bold and fearless, and if he keeps this up, he might actually do something as monumental as the aforementioned Dylan and Radiohead records someday.
B00005JO1G|4.0|\\"Jarhead\\" is an autobiographical account of a Marine sniper named Anthony Swofford, based on his 2003 book of the same name, about his service in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during Desert Storm in the early 1990's.  It is obviously a war movie, but not in the sense that it is filled with combat and carnage - indeed, the 2 1/2 hours of the film are almost totally void of any combat whatsoever.  It is a firsthand account of a group of men that were vigorously and relentlessly trained and prepared - all so they could sit and wait for months.  How do you keep your mind and body on edge and, as their sergeant says, \\"suspiciously alert\\" when nothing ever happens?  And if your mind and body are always thinking of battle, ready for combat, how do you handle months of stillness?  The film answers these questions in an honest and unsettling way.  For 2 1/2 hours, we get a small taste of the seemingly endless days of nothing that these highly trained Marines experienced.  Sound like the war movies you're used to? <br /> <br />It was directed by Sam Mendes, whose 1999 film \\"American Beauty\\" won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Mendes; Beauty is a gorgeous, darkly funny film about a 40-something nobody (played by Kevin Spacey) who experiences something of a personal renewal, which leads to a joyous, reckless lifestyle for the last year of his life, until he is murdered at the end of the film (If you think I have given something away, note the movie's opening line: \\"I'm Lester Burnham.  In less than a year, I'll be dead.\\").  He was also at the helm of 2002's \\"Road to Perdition,\\" the harrowing tale of a family man and his lingering mob connections, and their catastrophic results.  I mention these previous works for two purposes: 1) to show that Mendes is a talented and capable filmmaker with a poignant visual style, and 2) to demonstrate that he is fit for tragedy, and apt to make films with dark reality as their center.  \\"Jarhead\\" is nervously funny, and deals in a very subtle and poignant way with two dark and disturbing realities: the horror of war (a well-known, almost expected, theme for war movies) and the perhaps deeper horror of a wicked and mysterious tendency that lies in its participants.   <br /> <br />Am I being elusive here?  Perhaps there's no good way to put into words the emotions the movie provokes.  It is given validity not only by the fact that it is based on a firsthand account of the war, but by its strong performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal plays the narrator character, Anthony Swofford, and it is easily his best work, and shows us that we may see many more great achievements from this young actor.  Excellent supporting performances also come from Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard.   <br /> <br />
B0002UXBD6|5.0|greenday i've been waiting for a band in the last five years to finally release something that doesn't make george bush look like saint and talk about the state of america why are people so against politics and rock being mixed i for one love it i love to hear bands talk about a matter subjects just like bob dylan did in the early sixties politics in rock is not a new idea it's just people don't want to listen.. because they think it's not what rock is all about then what are bands supposed to talk about highschool proms and 6 grade stuff no thanks i perfer a band to have a political backbone like greenday and rage against the machine.. two bands who stuck their middle finger up to the people who turned up their noses and spat on them for not doing what they want them to do we've got enough sheep in this world and the yes no people now we need more people to have their own mind and give a f**** what is happening to our world and how we're destroying well done greenday for making a politcal album filled with cracking tunes  <br />
B000BGH22W|5.0|Harry in Winter is an amazing piece of music. It is by far the best track on the CD. Other great tracks are Potter Waltz, Neville's Waltz, Hogwarts March, and Foreign Visitors Arrive. There are other tracks that have good moments as well. Definitely worth the money!
B00008AWOD|5.0|brian moloko the singer and poetic visual maniac behind this little known group called placebo this being my second favorite album behind \\"without i'm nothing\\" another classic make-up album  <br />but this my friends and family is 2003 and placebo released their first single from \\"sleeping with ghosts\\" \\"the bitter end\\"  <br />a cracking single with a guitar riff to die for..so after hearing that repeatly played on mtv2 and went bought the album and from the opening bars of \\"bulletproof\\" the heavy instrument that set my pulses racing i hope the rest of the album would follow in suit of that single and the opening song and i wasn't disappointed this is a monster of an album  <br />yeah there's a few boring duds only two mine the rest are teenage glam masterpieces with liquid centres  <br />
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Download the first two songs, don't waste your money on the rest. Madonna has made a career out of hiring the best and most innovative producers to compensate for her lack of talent. This record is no different, if you like this record praise the producer, if you hate it, blame the producer, Madonna has nothing to do with it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|other reviewers have crictised greenday for going all polictal and selling out by wearing make-up and making a rock opera well hello wake up and smell the coffee the whole existience of the world is built on politics and if people are too dumb to expect that there are still some bands out there who stick their necks on the line and write a polictally charged album about the state of america  <br />well i've feel sorry for them..because most bands over the 50 years music has hit the airways there's been some great polictal bands  <br />but people just are to dumb to listen because they want fun and stupid well to all the reviewers who want dumb and stupid listen to offspring, bowling for soup etc  <br />but if you want a meaningful album with meaning to their lyrics than pick up this album and listen and i mean listen  <br />don't just fob it off as some pretentious c**** because it's actually quite good and entertaining  <br />i love bands who mix politics with rock i love it when a band has some meaningful subjects to talk about not the normal boy meets girl..ohhh i drop my pants twoodle i leave that to the busted's good charlottes and the son's of dorks to write for little teeny boppers oh yeah and linkin park  <br /> <br />get it if you actually have a mind
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have heard 'Hung Up' numerous times over the radio and television, but until you pop it in your car stereo, you will truly be blown right off your seat. Days before the album release, we got a little sneak preview of a few tracks from 'Confessions' at a Vancouver night club. As far as I recall, and judging from only half of all the tracks, the album was already of pure brilliance. Favourites tracks: 'Future Lovers', 'Sorry', 'Jump', and of course 'Hung Up'.  <br />
0060763280|4.0|I decided to read this book after I heard T. Harv Eker speak on a live teleseminar about his book and course.  I was impressed with his speaking style which is good for helping someone shift his or her beliefs.  He uses emotions and humor . . . and a fast patter . . . to make it easy to see your views more objectively.<br /><br />Mr. Eker makes a remarkable offer.  Buy this book and you can attend one of his three-day seminars for free.  I don't recall ever receiving an offer like that.  I assume that he makes his money by selling other services and products at the seminar, but that's fair.  Even when you pay thousands for a seminar, there are the inevitable pitches for more offerings.<br /><br />I figured that it wouldn't hurt to listen to someone who seems to have a talent for helping change beliefs for three days.<br /><br />I have been to other seminars on similar subjects, such as the one that Tony Robbins used to offer for Mastery University, and have been very disappointed in each case.  So my expectations for the book and seminar weren't very high.  But the book does seem to be a cut above many of the other \\"reprogram your assumptions\\" books to improve your financial situation.<br /><br />What I liked about the book was that Mr. Eker has identified so many different belief systems that can hold someone back from pursuing prosperity.  The heart of the book comes in his 17 contrasts between what rich people believe and what poor people believe.  The most fundamental is number one:  \\"Rich people believe 'I create my life.' Poor people believe 'Life happens to me.'\\"  That's a pretty standard prescription for self-improvement authors and trainers.<br /><br />One that I hadn't thought about before is \\"Rich people admire other rich and successful people.  Poor people resent rich and successful people.\\"  It's pretty hard to work on becoming like someone you resent.  That thought caused me to pause.<br /><br />An unexpected point (which I suspect came from Built to Last) is that \\"Rich people think 'both.'  Poor people think 'either/or.'\\"  I thought that perspective was also new and useful in this context.<br /><br />None of the other 15 points were unexpected to me.  But perhaps if you are new to the idea that rich people think differently than poor people you will find all of these points to be novel.  After all, we each have a different row to hoe in life.<br /><br />The sections are brief and a fast reader can gobble this book down in less than an hour.<br /><br />But you come away feeling comfortable that Mr. Eker will help you cross the chasm to changing your assumptions about life.<br /><br />The book's main weakness is the emphasis on the rich-poor contrast.  It would have been more helpful to have a stairway of attitudes beginning with billionaires and working on down through the homeless.  A book of that sort could help somewhat people expand their financial perspectives to a higher level better than this book does.<br /><br />Mr. Eker communicates clearly and with credibility.  If you are serious about wanting to improve your balance sheet, this book can be a helpful part of the process . . . but think about going to one of those seminars as well.  I suspect you'll get far more benefit from the combination than either one alone.Poor people think 'either/or.'\\"  I thought that perspective was also new and useful in this context.

B000B8QEZG|1.0|Hung Up is the only song on this album worth anthing. I found myself skipping songs to find a different beat. Everything melded into each other and sound all the same. Boring.
B00005JO1G|4.0|Even if the author didn't intend it to be, Jarhead is most certainly a backhanded slap at the American military. What makes Jarhead stand out from all other war films is that there is seemingly no war going on for much of the duration of this film. Rather, it is a psychological journey inside the minds of marines who are simply waiting around for their chance to kill something...anything. So whether it be having scorpion death matches, an illegal hootch party or simply wacking off, the tone and tenor of the film never waivers. Its glaicial pacing is vital to preserving the tone of the film. So although, Jarhead is certainly not the best film about war ever made it is certainly unique and original. Sam Mendes continues to challenge the norm with his gutsy directorial choices and although this film is no American Beauty, it is still a fine addition to his resume. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job as Anthony Swofford, simple, brooding and understated. My only problem with Jarhead is it's resolution or lack thereof. It seems as though the author has chosen to sidestep the most vital issues of the Gulf War for fear of taking sides. This is one of the only films I've ever seen where the author/director have actually gone out of their way to stradle the fence and it's disappointing but alas the good outweighs the bad here. Recommended.
0316168815|2.0|***I really like to give books a fair shot, but this one was just terrible!! I am not in the habit of giving a book such a low rating, but this novel warranted nothing more than two stars(I am feeling generous).*** <br /> <br />I don't understand how such a lovely premise for a novel could be implemented so terribly. It is as if the writer(Alice) decided to speed write, and jot down all the ideas in her head and not bother to structure them. A little girl dies in a terribly clichd killing and inhabits both the spiritual and elemental world at the same time. Oh sorry...I can't help myself...YAWN.  <br /> <br />I want you all to be proud of me so I will let you in on a little secret. I have only put down two books in my life, Stephen King's Gunslinger and the Rule of Four(officially the crappiest book ever), and I was determined not to make the \\"Lovely Bones\\" the third book on my list of UNREADABLES, so I forced myself to read it. Oh and I was so glad I did! I would have missed out on all the clich plot \\"twists\\"(this novel trys to put a WHO-DUNNIT spin on things but fails miserably), terrible grammar usage, and so many other horrors.  <br />  <br />The only way that I can describe the setting and writing style of this novel would be to tell you to pick up a book that was WRITTEN for a preteen and compare it with \\"The Lovely Bones\\" you will find the style, prose, and plot development very similar.
0553213105|5.0|Elizabeth Bennet, Jane Austen's best known heroine, conquers her station in life and the harsh judgment of the incredibly handsome Mr. Darcy, and attains her own happiness in the classic \\"Pride and Pejudice.\\"<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this novel! It was a little hard going in the beginning. The first half of the novel moved slowly and I was very frustrated with Austen's language, but I am so glad I stuck with it. By the last half of the book, I was completely absorbed by the drama of the story and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I wish the characters had more definition. I feel like I couldn't get a true sense of Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy because of the lack of detail. But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Since she burst onto the scene in 1983, critics have been predicting the end of Madonna's career. Hah. In her incredible 22-year run, she's released eleven albums of original music (some of it good, some of it great, some of it brilliant, and almost all of it underrated), performed in countless captivating music videos and tours, and managed to combine fine art and popular culture in a way that no one else ever has.<br /><br />After the somber, electro-folk \\"American Life\\", which sold millions of copies but was considered a failure (?), Madonna returns with \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", 12 songs of enchanting, blissful future-disco that reaffirm Madonna's ability to appeal to the masses without ever just catering to the lowest common denominator.<br /><br />Critics talking trash about Madonna are like dogs barking at the moon. She's an unstoppable force of nature and an artist unparalleled.

B00005JO1J|5.0|I've had the privilege of seeing Rent on Broadway three <br />times with the original cast.  My family are Rent junkies. <br />We plan entire Christmas galas around the music of Rent. <br />We had high expectations and I'm very pleased to say <br />that we were not disappointed.  Chris Columbus did a very <br />good job at translating the musical to film.  Bringing <br />in all the original cast members with the exception of <br />Mimi is what made it work. Our old friends were back again.  <br />And the new Mimi was wonderful. Even when the transition  <br />from scene to scene was just a blank screen...it worked.  <br />So go see Rent!  You won't be disappointed. And don't forget to see it on Broadway or on the road.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Very high!  <br /> <br />I totally recommend this fantastic dance recording!
B000BEZQ18|5.0|I stumbled upon this soundtrack at a record store recently & decided to give it a shot, as the roster of artists impressed me.  I'm glad I made my purchase.  This soundtrack is easily one of the year's best.    There are a number of distinguished country artists performing new tracks, some written specifically for the film.  Willie Nelson is first up with a gorgeous cover of Bob Dylan's \\"He Was A Friend Of Mine.\\"  Emmylou Harris also turns in a poignant performance on \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old,\\" a beautiful song written specifically for the film by Argentinian musician Gustavo Santaolalla (who provides the film's score-- more on that later) & lyricist Bernie Taupin.  I hope this gets some Oscar consideration!    Mary McBride, Teddy Thompson & Jackie Greene give nice performances in ballads also written for the film by Santaolalla/Taupin.  The strength of these songs are impressive, especially considering the fact that they come from an Argentinian guitarist & a pop/rock lyricist.  These songs sound like they belong in any classical country canon.     The only tracks that weigh down the album are Steve Earle's \\"The Devil's Right Hand,\\" & Linda Ronstandt's Buddy Holly cover, \\"It's So Easy,\\" both recycled hits for the artists in 1987 & 1977, respectively.  They break the mood of the album & just sound out of place here.     Also somewhat out of place, but just simply delightful, is Rufus Wainwright & Teddy Thompson's cover of Roger Miller's \\"King Of The Road.\\"  The track doesn't even appear in the film, but it's inspired & downright fun.      But it's Rufus Wainwight's solo track, \\"The Maker Makes,\\" that is the highlight of the album for me.  It's a beautiful, twangy, heartwrenching little ballad that's performed on the piano.  I get the chills each time I hear it!  I'm a big fan of Rufus & Teddy Thompson, so I may be biased, but they too succeed in creating country songs that transcend their singer/songwriter limitations.         The tracks from Santaolalla's score start to sound kind of similar-- stark guitar instrumental interludes-- but they no doubt capture the essence & emotion of the film.  I'm only familiar with his work from the Motorcycle Diaries (which was right up his alley), but he seems to segueway into American westerns seemlessly & with much grace.    Just about all the songs and instrumental cues on this album are huge achievements in conveying the emotional themes of the film: love, loss & longing.  It's a soundtrack full of passion that transends musical genres.  These aren't just country & western songs-- they're love songs.
0380729407|5.0|Bradbury's classic tale is about two thirteen-year-old boys who dally with a strange and evil circus and end up fighting a battle to save their town from the dark forces of evil.  There are many vividly frightening characters and scenes along the way.  When things are looking really grim for the boys and the society, one of their fathers steps in, believes their outlandish tales, and joins forces with them.  The father figure spouts eloquent philosophy on a wide range of subjects, and in the end, he's the true battle hero, which is a little disappointing, because I wanted the young heroes to shine more.  Overall, this is a great read around the month of October, and I know it will be enjoyed by generations to come.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I'm sure people like Madonna and Janet have released special editions before in their music careers, yeah, but that's not what I'm getting at Mariah for. I used to like her. <br /> <br />The fact that she's released this album four times over (as many other reviewers have already stumbled up on), and also released her Merry Christmas album recently for a second time on dual disc, shows she's just too desperate for money. Shine like that one star you used to be, girl.
0446677450|5.0|This book is a super starting point for nailing down the concepts and mindset of being an investor as opposed to an employee.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|All I can say about this new Madonna cd, appropriatley titled, Confessions on a Dancefloor is AWESOME. Madonna,has never been better creatively. She got it right on, she hit all the right buttons on every single track on this cd. This is what her fans are craving for, dance music from the Queen of Pop, is what she does best.  <br /> <br />Best track for me is Hung Up, great dance beats, it really does makes your feet move, whether you like it or not. Sorry, love this song, its an unapologetic Madonna anthem, brings you back in the 80's. Push, it has some RnB flavour to it.  <br /> <br />Although, every track on the CD is worth listening, it's awesome, what a great package. WELL DONE MADONNA.  <br /> <br />
0743201140|4.0|\\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" is about finding your \\"natural talents\\" or the things that you were born with that you can do naturally well.  This is different from skills and education, both of which can be learnt.  The difference is you can because \\"good\\" at anything with enough time and effort to educate yourself and learn the skills, but you will never be \\"great\\" without the natural talent.<br /><br />This book takes the refreshing approach of focusing on the strengths rather than the weaknesses of a person.  After reading the first 3 chapters, you take an online test to help you determine your strengths.  I found the test to be helpful and interesting, but not surprising.<br /><br />The book then describes each of the 34 talents with a one page description.  However I was hoping for much more.  After learning what my talents were, I wanted to know lots of techniques I could use to develop and incorporate my talents in my daily life.  However, there really wasn't much to be had.  I guess that is saved for the \\"one-on-one coaching\\".<br /><br />Still, this book is worth the read.  It's targeted at HR and managers, but it's a good read for everybody.  4 out of 5 stars.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First of all, i totally disagree with the people who would even think to give this album one star.  This album deserves 10 stars, because even though the songs are filled with 4 or 5 power chords, does not mean anything.  This whole album was written from the heart and Billie Joe Armstrong's perspective.  And yes, there are characters in this album.  Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, and Whatsername.  Not many punk bands today have made a concept album like this one.  I have been to a Green Day concert.  By the way they perform, you can tell their music is their life, because they are so into the music it's great. <br />  <br />Every song on this album is awesome.  <br />Favorites(this was difficult): <br />Jesus of Suburbia- drums and guitars on this song are great <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams- heartfelt song with great lyrics <br />Give Me Novacaine- addicting, sad song to listen to when you are feeling down <br />Letterbomb- great guitar and drum parts, cant stop listening to this one <br />Homecoming- great song, best nine minutes you will ever spend listening to something <br />Whatsername- a great ending song <br /> <br />If you want to listen to a great punk album, check this out.  Do not skip this album over.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I personally don't care who acted in it or who wrote the soundtrack or even who the director was. All I know is that I was on the edge of my seat for the full 2 hours, as this film just does not let up. It has a compelling (but not too deep) storyline and fantastically choreographed action scenes that, while spectacular, are not unreal. In fact, I think it is the \\"realness\\" of this film that made me get so involved with what was happening. Compare this with a Schwarzenegger flick where half the scenes are just so \\"out there\\" you roll your eyes and smirk and sit back to wait for the predictable happy ending. Here, there's real danger, real suspense and a plot to challenge you. Highly recommended!

0553213105|5.0|The first time I read Pride and Prejudice I was in seventh grade and I found it difficult to read and of little interest; so when I picked it up again as a senior in high school and discovered its brilliance it came as quite a surprise. I should not have been surprised, however, for any work authored by Jane Austen is bound to be genius. With her witty dialogue that had me laughing out loud and the heartachingly poignant love fiascos that left me in tears of frustration, she successfully turned me into another Darcy fanatic.<br /><br /> The characters are timeless-Elizabeth with her candor and brilliance, Darcy with his romantic soul waiting to explode, and Mr. Bennet with his stoic attitude towards the Mrs.-and the plot will never grow old. Even if the book were as long as War and Peace I would not be deterred if I knew I was to be rewarded with the defining moment when Elizabeth returns Darcy's declaration of love. What makes this book what is though is not just the tryst between Elizabeth and Darcy, but the social commentaries Austen makes about the period and all of the outcomes that are swayed by the civilities of society. Clearly a classic that remains just as magical as the day it was written, Pride and Prejudice should be required reading for everyone, boys and girls alike (hey you boys out there might just learn something from Darcy's quiet love approach).
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I say four because she's released three limited editions of The Emancipation Of Mimi (the original version is obviously NOT a limited edition), and she's releasing a fourth limited edition soon, and a fifth version of the same album.  <br /> <br />1- The Emancipation Of Mimi  <br /> <br />2- The Emancipation Of Mimi Limited Edition <br /> <br />3- The Emancipation Of Mimi Ultra Platinum Edition <br /> <br />4- The Emancipation Of Mimi Ultra Platinum Edition w/DVD <br /> <br />5- *COMING SOON!* The Emancipation Of Mimi Diamond Dulexe Edition <br /> <br />Point proved on why this is 1-star and why it deserves no credit. Sorry Mariah!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|From the second I put this CD into my stereo at home, I knew it was going to be good. The array of sounds that emanate from the album, the intricate guitar work, and the rythmic, bluesy vibe it has are impressive and indicative of Mayer's growth as a musician. <br />The first three songs are jazz/blues tracks that kick off the CD in a playful, upbeat manner. Mayer demonstrates his guitar prowess and lyrical abilities in these, especially in the awesome intro to track three.  <br />Although the Billboard review thought that track four, \\"Gravity\\", did not fit with the generally cheerful, playful tone of the album, I think it's a great song that adds another dimension to the work.  <br />Vultures is my favorite song on the CD-- it's one of Mayer's best (up there with 3x5). The lyrics are impressive, and the music simply enveloped me during my first listen!Mayer also experiments with singing falsetto; and, oddly enough, listening to it wasn't painful. <br />Overall, this CD is something that true John Mayer fans have been waiting for. He kind of came out of the closet in the sense that he's beginning to leave his pop roots behind and move in the direction of jazz and blues. Try! is a fun, album that brings John Mayer's guitar skills, musical and lyrical development, and disinterest in formulaic pop music to light. Buy it-- it's really great! <br />
1592400876|5.0|\\"I can cook good and respect costumers as well.\\"  The previous statement is not found in Lynne Truss' s book. It is from an actual job application submitted in LA. However, she could easily have used it. The poor wording allows the reader to gather at least two meanings from the sentence though, surely, the writer did not mean that he cooked good customers. (I don't think I want to eat at a restaurant where this guy works.&lt;Grin>)<br /><br />Citing such examples as the one above and numerous others, Ms. Truss seemingly issues a call to arms for grammar \\"sticklers.\\" Yet though she writes, \\"Sticklers unite!\\" she backs away from being a language purist. She recognizes the fact that languages and grammar evolve. Even the Publisher's Note on page xv mentions that there are differences between British and American punctuation.<br /><br />So what is the purpose of this book? \\"Well, you know those self-help books that give you permission to love yourself? This one (book) gives you permission to love punctuation\\" (page 33). I guess I have a love of punctuation. With a little smile, I used what is now called a substandard form of punctuation in the first sentence I wrote for this book review. I also use the Oxford comma. If one smiles at such things, this book will keep one smiling.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|Tim Burton's second take on Batman is more gothic and more brooding than the first. While Burton has a great eye for visuals, he lacks in telling a story, but spends too much time developing characters (there has to be a balance) and allowing screen writers to focus on quick one liners instead of good, solid dialogue (Waters). Keaton pulls Batman off nicely and is the bright spot in this movie. The chemistry between him and Michael Gough (Alfred) works well once again. Michelle Pfeiffer is good as the Catwoman and while most people didn't like Danny Devito's Penguin, I find it an interesting take and more threatening than the previous incarnations. The movie should have one villain, but instead, has three and we get a choppy plot and Batman in once again neglected. Burton claims this was intential, to keep Batman dark and mysterious - that it does do, but a Batman story is still much better (see Batman Begins). Christopher Walken is Max Scheck, another villain, who tried to kill the Catwoman, twice, and betrays the Penguin, and to boot, this character adds nothing to the film but another psyche to deal with.<br /><br />Burton's film starts off well enough, but soon turns into a bore. By the middle of the film, Batman returns, but is once again neglected. The end is as much about the Catwoman and the end of the film is lackluster to say the least. Still, one admires Burton's attempt and Keaton's performance. Danny Elfman's score is once again outstanding.<br /><br />The extras are once again great.  They added the promo \\"The Bat, the Cat, and the Penguin\\" that was hosted by Robert Urich in June 92.  Part III \\"Shadaws of the Bat\\" continues where the other special additions leave off.  I can honestly say the special editions are more entertaining than the movie, and after watching them, I found the movie more enjoyable.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This movie does know what it's trying to do...and does it quite well. The reviewer below seems to want a simple story and complains that the movie is misguided in its purpose. I strongly disagree. The film centers around Crowe's character and his doctor/friend and their VARIED adventures on the ship. The beautiful part of this film is its complexity. The music is memorable, the cinematography is awesome and the storyline is satisfying.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.
B000BKDOCA|4.0|Most remix albums are horrible, plain and simple.  So was I expecting any different from B In The Mix, Britney Spear's \\"newest\\" album, to be any different?  No.  But I was soon proven wrong, and this album turned out to be above average.  While I think \\"Toxic\\" was drawn out at first, it was still decent.  But the album really took off on the second track, showing a great remix of \\"Me Against The Music\\" ft. Madonna.  However, the true beauty in this album is that it can take originals I was never too crazy over and actually make them good, as in the case of \\"Early Mornin'\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last Know\\".  Also, \\"Breathe On Me\\", which was a personal favorite from In The Zone, is beautifully redone, and \\"And Then We Kiss\\" is great as well.  The only things that hold this album back is that some of the songs are too long (\\"Toxic\\", \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", and \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last Know\\".)  Also, while I like the remix as well, I would like the original version of \\"Someday\\" on an album too.  But all in all this is a great album that went beyond my expectations.  Definitely a must have for Britney fans.
0440178002|5.0|I first read this book when I was in college.  I'd always been interested in Asian culture & history, and I picked it up in a book store on a whim.  It's well over a thousand pages in length, but once you get past the beginning, it's hard to put down.  Over the years I've recommended it to many friends and almost all of them have enjoyed it.<br /><br />The novel can best be classified as historical fiction.  In the story, European sailors are first starting to discover Japan.  Throughout the story you get to know an English sailor who gradually becomes accepted in Japanese society.  The story is filled with romance and action, while at the same time providing an overview of the Japanese samurai culture.<br /><br />If you've ever had an interest in Japanese culture, I strongly recommend this book.  While the historical elements are fictional, the time period is accurately described and you can get an interesting feel for the period.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I am sitting here listening to the new album by Enya - Amarantine that UPS left on my doorstep today. Make that \\"bathing in the sonic reverberations of the phenomenon that is her music\\". :-) Definitely no mistaking who made this album, that's for sure. There's something about her music and the production that seems to relax every muscle in my body - the full lush orchestration that seems to hit most of the highs and lows of the musical spectrum in one chord. Her voice reminds me quite often when the higher notes trail off, of the scene in Lord of the Rings where Gandalf is whisting for the horse, Shadowfax.<br /><br />Yes, it's quite unmistakably Enya. But that's not a bad thing in my opinion. I quite like it. :-)
B00009V7P8|5.0|I first heard of Damien Rice from the movie Closer. I watched the video and loved \\"The Blowers Daughter\\". I always had it on my \\"to buy\\" list, but never found it, wasn't looking very hard either. Then a british friend told me how wonderful the disc was, so I had to get it. My was he ever right!  <br /> <br />The songs all seem a bit melancholy, but it will evoke emotion in you that you didn't think possible from a song. They are haunting rhythms, but just beautiful to listen to. I'm hooked and it's my 2d favorite CD. <br /> <br />A-
B0006L16N8|5.0|<br />Why the fuss over X&Y? Because A Rush of Blood to the Head was so good. <br /> <br />Instead of wringing our hands over the fact that X&Y may not surpass AROBTTH, let's just relax and enjoy the music.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|I've read a few of the reviews on Star Trek - Nemesis.  I've seen the movie on cable several times.  I like this movie enough that I'm going to purchase the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" at a good price.  As much of a fan of both the Original \\"Star Trek\\" and, of course, \\"Star Trek, the Next Generation\\" series that I am, I am not forgetting that their original premise is to entertain.  I find the acting good and the Graphics/Special effects very, very good!  Could they have made improvements?  Certainly!  This is just science fiction, folks.  Not real life!  Try to remember that, please?  My rating: Four stars!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The casting of this film is what made is great. I wasn't sure at first if I would enjoy it or not, but bought it all the same.<br /><br />From the moment it started I was drawn into the story. Anne Elliot (Amanda Root) was in love with a common man and was forced to give him up - leaving her so many years later classified as a 'Plain Jane' and 'Old Maid'. Amanda looks the part and acts is perfectly.<br /><br />Unexpectantly he returns, no longer a commoner but a Captain - Captain Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds). But he shows no interest in Anne, but the younger prettier girls.<br /><br />Of course, he can't deny his true feelings forever and has to make a move or leave.<br /><br />My only slight disappointment was that there is no bonus on the DVD, but I recommend it all the same.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Yes she has done it again, Madonna has pulled something good out of the bag and re-established herself after the rubbish that was American Life.  This CD is full of great dance tracks and Madonna has reclaimed her throne even if for once she isn't leading the charge but just being part of the pack.  It is a competent comeback and nothing more as there is nothing new or remotely original here.  Hung Up would be lost without the ABBA backing and Sorry (track 3) is just Hung Up without the ABBA backing and to rhyme New York with dork is really scratching the bottom of the barrel.  A must buy for the fans and anyone that just loves loves loves 'Hung Up'.  Unfortunately for Ms Ciccone this won't win many new converts.
0380715430|3.0|I really enjoyed reading the book.  Lots of great stories.  I especially enjoyed the history of various attempts at spelling reform in the English language.  This is a subject I have often considered myself.  I agree with Bryson that comprehensive spelling reform is impossible.  However, I think that limited spelling reform based on changing just a few words--perhaps some of the most commonly misspelled ones where a clear commonsense alternative exists--could work.<br /><br />Bryson's criticism of the movement to make English the official language of the U.S. struck me as shallow and wrongheaded.  He too easily dismisses as irrelevant the serious problems caused by conflicts over language in Canada, Belgium, and similar multilingual countries.  We don't need such problems here, and I think anything we can do to prevent them is all to the good.  Bilingual education is expensive, and it has been shown repeatedly to provide no benefits over the immersion method of teaching English to children.
0684824906|5.0|This extraordinary history of the Lincoln administration will surely become the authoratative source on a little explored subject.  Goodwin brings Lincoln's cabinet to life.  The major figures are given personalities and families for us to consider.  The research required for such a study took ten years, but this book is well worth your time.  I will never again think of Lincoln without remembering the men he worked with to win the war.   <br /> <br />     What was the major political issue of the time?  The same theme that present day Civil War buffs argue about-  ie. was the fight about union or slavery?  There was not much agreement in the camps and Lincoln's greatness was to keep both on his side.  Lincoln's political alacrity is an aspect few people realized-  then or now. <br /> <br />     My favorite vignette:  Abe at age 6 or 7 listening to adult stories around the fireplace and then translating them into kidspeak so that he could take the stump and charm the neighborhood.  This skill served him well all his political life.   <br /> <br />     However, the single big thing one takes from Team of Rivals is the remarkable personality of the President.  As pundits point out, character matters.  Lincoln's character approaches sainthood.  Here's a leader who appointed his rivals to his cabinet and seemingly enjoyed the interplay of opinion.  He even tolerated Salmon Chase to seek the presidency in the 1864 election while still serving as Treasury Secretary.  Lincoln insisted on meeting with countless numbers of critics, petioners and common folk.  He walked battlefields and fraternized with troops.  He answered his opponents with honest explanations of the necessity to balance influence.  In short, he played to the sensible moderates, not the crazies in the wings.  This is a great book about the greatest President.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is back with yet another corker! This is just a fabulous dance recording and I am soooo glad she picked Stuart Price to work with her on it because he's such a great DJ! If you were to buy a dance CD this is it! It's great to see Madonna having fun and enjoying herself just as much as we can listening to the album!
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Hypnotize, alot like Mezmerize has some excellent songs, but also there were those that would just be better if Daron wouldve have not sang....Serj is the lead singer , so let him sing alone now and then. The three songs that really got me on this cd were hypnotize, U-Fig, and Vicinity of Obscenity. Cant wait for whenever their next one comes out.
0345457684|1.0|I  give this book one star and that only because it was late night reading before I was ready to nod off.  <br /> <br />This is pseudo cyberpunk meets the wild west. It should appeal to the gadget hungry Yugeo set, those who invent plots and tech where and when you get into a corner.  <br /> <br />Extropians and techies will love it because it has one of every possible idea once we find that we can download the human mind into a chip which is not much more than the portable media we carry on a watch chain today. <br /> <br />Oh, yes, move over Bester, we can travel mentally into stored replacas or any other body where the chip has been removed. <br /> <br />How does the author extend this story to over 500 pages? He watches the cartoon series shown on afternoon TV. <br /> <br />Give Rambo access to James Bond's store of gadgets. Wind him up and turn him loose on some pseudo renegade mission, inventing subplots to keep Rambo on his carnage campaign and you have the story. Don't bother worrying about any substance; just revel in the carnage.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Amazing for 9 guys to sound that great and alot like the studio versions of the songs. They picked the best selection of songs to put on this double disc album, Disasterpiece, before i forget, left behind, pulse of the maggots, heretic anthem , duality, people=poop, and wait and bleed are absolutely remarkable. The thing i was most pumped to listen to when i picked it up in the store and looked at the back was when i saw that there was a drum solo. Being a drummer myself, Joey Jordison is the god of all percussion right now, without a doubt. I know there's alot of diverse opinions on slipknot but all in all they are extremely good at what they do, and i liked the live album alot.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Today we like to think of the modern-day office environment as the embodiment of all that is soulless about the corporate world. But in truth, the cubicle was designed to actually make life better for the average worker. It was designed to give them privacy and some degree of independence, as opposed to the previous custom of having rows and rows of desk next to each other in orderly fashion. So what went wrong? <br /> <br />\\"Office Space\\" is a light comedy, but it gives a lot of answers to the question of why the modern corporate office has become such an alienating place. It is because everyone is in their own world. We see it in the opening scene, even while the characters are driving to work in their cars. They each have their own way of dealing with traffic. They arrive at work already alienated. Furthermore, the cast of quirky characters in the film suggests that each person is in their own world: Milton sits in his cubicle whining about his stapler, Mike Bolton sits around wondering how to bring down the company, Peter worries about avoiding his boss, Drew probably thinks up elaborate sexual fantasies, etc. <br /> <br />In other words, even though we might like to think of the modern office as being an annoying place where we have to deal with annoying people, I think \\"Office Space\\" suggests that the real problem is that we are so alienated from each other in the office. (Check out the hilarious scene where Peter is talking on the phone to somebody, and the camera pans over to reveal that it's Milton, in the cubicle next to him.) This kind of alienation increases the impersonal nature of the place and heightens the paranoia -- which is really what \\"Office Space\\" is about.
B00005RRG9|5.0|This movie has inspired so many spin-offs!  Fans of high tech effects will be disappointed, but this is a great flash to the past in special effects... it wasn't always to easy to make someone a twin!  I like this version much better than the remake.  Hayley Mills has left many kids classics for generations!  Who would've thought that finding your long-lost twin at camp and trying to get your parents back together again would stand the test of time?  My husband hates it, so until my daughter to be old enough to enjoy it with me, I'll have to watch it when I'm home alone!
B000AGTPUA|5.0|First off for the comment saying about the little kids didn't use good judgement when they got on the train.... oh jeez it's a MOVIE, I think this is a great movie and everyone should have a copy. People do not use good judgment when they write comments like that. Everyones a critic these days, and they bitch and complain way too much. God get a LIFE!
B000002UAF|5.0|Not a lot to say, just...excellent! I love this album, I'm almost going to say it's my favourite..but I'm not quite sure yet! I think the earlier stuff from The Beatles are just as good as their later music.  <br />Although, only the first six tracks on this album were featured on the film, the other half of the album is just as pleasant. With songs like, You Can't Do That, and I'll Be Back, just completes the album.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended. You need this album to complete your Beatles collection. <br />
B0007O38F8|2.0|this album is not too good. I've listened to the full album once in my life. the reason I haven't been listening to it is because it stinks. There is only 2 good songs I kind of like, which is Get in My Car, and Candy Shop. The rest stink, no doubt about it. I turn on the music, I hear the intro, In my hood comes on, I'm sleeping standing up, BORING,zzzzzzzzzzzz
B00006CXSS|5.0|everything you need to know about this wonderful mini-series has already been stated by others.. <br />i'm only adding that i own the book and the dvd set itself and i can't get enough of it. it's a wonderful addition to anyones collection. <br /> <br />if you haven't purchased this yet, do so now!
B00000F169|5.0|This movie is as fresh and funny as it was when it was first released. The fact that this was a student film makes its high quality all the more amazing and commendable. There is so much to admire about DARK STAR i don't know where to begin: The talking bombs, the beach-ball alien, the whole gonzo concept of astronauts going insane after being kept in space for way too long, the excellent model effects and optical work, the crazily inventive low-budget sets, the familar rumble of Carpenter's synth score, the obviously stoned actors.<br /><br />For a no-budget project made by a bunch of pot-head college kids over 30 yrs ago, DARK STAR has more going for it than all of Holywood's so-called high concept blockbusters  put together.
B00005JO17|5.0|I have to admit that I was dragged into the movie theater - I simply was not interested in a movie about a chicken. But I was positively surprised... I have watched it twice - the first time I saw the normal version and the second time I watched the 3D Version. Even though I loved the normal version, you have to see the 3D Version! That is amazing! If you have the choice - see the 3D Version. Great movie, great music! So much detail in every frame... funny... cute... I liked it as much as I liked the Pixar movies. Go see it!
B00005JODA|3.0|I thought this was a perfectly-cast and wonderfully-acted film <br />(particularly by Rachel Weisz) but there were too many elisions <br />from the novel to make the plot entirely coherent.   I also found <br />the depiction of Africa rather too unrealistically hygienic and <br />the penultimate scene at Quayle's memorial service  was a disappointment, straining credulity to the utmost. However. the <br />theme of corruption in high places is, unfortunately, only too <br />topical and the film is successful in engaging one's sympathies <br />and holding one's attention.  Not a patch on \\"City of God\\", though
B000002JEV|5.0|Beware!  The live version of \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" on this compilation is not for the faint of heart!  It will remind you why Led Zeppelin were rock giants among pure amateurs.  What other band could take one song, pull your heartstrings and then bludgeon you over the head with sheer rock power... and make you love it! <br /> <br />This CD set finally sets to rest the \\"Zeppelin as Heavy Metal\\" argument.  They were NOT heavy metal.  This is louder than loud amplified blues, yes, but it is their live show that displays their unbelievable dynamic breadth.  The band was more rock and roll than it was \\"Sweet Leaf.\\"  <br /> <br />If you have ever been a doubter of their music after these long years, please at least give this a listen.  Live, the Zep weren't FM radio superstar darlings.  They were a bunch of guys who happened to make great music when they go together.  Here, it sounds like they are just enjoying playing together- no record charts, nothing and everything to prove. <br /> <br />It's unbelievable.
0767817486|4.0|This biography is a true story about a young American who gets caught in Turkey (right before he boards the plane to go home) smuggling drugs. The movie moves a bit slow after authorities incarcerate him. Makes me think twice about traveling to third-world countries. Good drama and descent story. BEST screen play I have ever seen. Though there should be a remake of the movie to spiff it up a little more.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|A great album sounds better and Springsteen fans will be experiencing nirvana (no, not the band silly--the other nirvana)with the concert DVD. The cinemascope production makes this album sound bigger, bolder and with better depth than before.<br /><br />The CD remaster sounds decent but not as good as the first Japanese pressing. The booming production makes the previous CD sound tinny by comparison (except the first Japanese pressing)improving on the original U.S. manufactured CD. Is this version definitive? Not really. There is a bit too much compression applied to the mastering but, quite honestly, due to the choices during recording \\"Born to Run\\" is never going to be a model of audiophile recording.<br /><br /> The remastering There aren't any extra tracks or outtakes and that's a pity because you know there have to be some around somewhere. By the way, Amazon refers to this as the \\"first retooling\\" of any Springsteen album. That's not quite true--\\"Born to Run\\" received a 20 bit remaster limited edition release about a decade ago. I prefer that remaster to this and there were a couple of \\"secret\\" remasters that were also issued over the years.<br /><br />The Hammersmith/Odeon Concert from 1975 is the crown jewel here for fans. This concert which hasn't been available on DVD before looks quite good with solid sound as well. Springsteen performs most of \\"Born to Run\\" as well as classics such as \\"It's Hard to Be A Saint in the City\\" and \\"Spirit in the Night\\". It's an entire vintage concert with the Boss and his band in top form.<br /><br />The \\"making of\\" DVD covers everything from the pressure that Springsteen was working under to produce a hit album for Columbia Records to working with the band in the studio to achieve the sound he wanted for the album. Finally the \\"Hype\\" of Springsteen that threatened to overtake the value of the album and the artist is also discussed. Featuring vintage footage and new interviews, it's a marvelous glimpse into the creation of one of the top ten albums of all time. There are also three performances from 1973 recorded in Los Angeles-\\"Spirit in the Night\\" \\"Wild Billy's Circus Story\\" and \\"Thundercrack\\".<br /><br />The whole package comes in a large cardboard box with a cardboard replica of the original vinyl packaging for \\"Born to Run\\" and cardboard holders for the DVDs. The CD features a label that mimics the Columbia label for the original \\"Born to Run\\" and looks like vinyl on both the top and bottom (it's an unusal looking CD in that it's all black except for the label area). I do agree that these probably should have been released in something a bit sturdier but that's pretty minor and easy to fix--go out and buy some jewelboxes. Finally, there's a booklet with numerous rare and previously unreleased photos of Springsteen and the band. A brief essay from Springsteen's book \\"Songs\\" is included. The 1975 concert also has a couple of paragraphs written by Springsteen about the experience of seeing and performing in London for the first time.<br /><br />30 years later it's still a great album given a deluxe presentation by Columbia. A great Christmas package for the Springsteen fan in your family and while the original album doesn't quite sound as ideal as I'd hoped, it is decent if a bit loud and compressed.e of the top ten albums of all time.

The 1975 concert also has a couple of paragraphs written by Springsteen about the experience of seeing and performing in London for the first time.<br /><br />30 years later it's still a great album given a deluxe presentation by Columbia. A great Christmas package for the Springsteen fan in your family and while the original album doesn't quite sound as ideal as I'd hoped, it is decent if a bit loud and compressed.
0452285186|1.0|I cannot believe that anyone took the time to write such an empty, humorous book. It is not worth even the time to write this review, but I feel compelled to perhaps influence someone else who might expect something worth reading.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|After the disappointment known as \\"Exciter\\" I despaired of DM ever bringing back their good old days of dance and electronica. This album reminds me of older DM, like Music for the Masses mixed with a healthy dose of Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion. The first seven songs are amazing, especially tracks 3 and 5 (5 being their first single from the album). After that, it definitely slows down, but all songs are enjoyable. For those that have waited to see Depeche Mode bring back their glory days, the album will not disappoint.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|I love the Eurythmics.  I always have.  I saw them in concert a few years back and it actually sealed what I thought of them.  I always knew they were great, but they were good performers too and Annies voice is totally amazing.  It's a testament to their talent that they are still around and still have the ability to sell albums.  I love Thorn In My Side.  It's my all time favourite of theirs and it's on here along with so many other fantastic songs that they've done over the years.  You can dance along to this since there are so many upbeat songs and there's the variety of a few slower ones too.  This music is classic and it is a must buy for all of their fans and even some new ones.  You'll love it.
B0007NFL18|1.0|That's true. just think of the fact of him releasing a pointless hood movie, a video game, and a clothing line. Anyone can read the writing on the wall and tell that his fifteen minutes are just about up.  <br /> <br />Sorry but pretty soon, the \\"CANDY SHOP\\" will be permantly closed
0060594888|5.0|I think that if you read this book you will never need to read another self help book again.  Buy it and cherish it.  The one fundamental principle that I took away with me and use every day much to my delight is to just \\"Ask!\\"  Ask and it may be yours - maybe not today but you are on your way!  I wish everyone all the success in this world!  We are all on this planet together.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Fans have been crying for an album from Enya (born Eithne Ni Bhraon&aacute;in) for five dry years since \\"A Day Without Rain\\" gave us the huge single \\"Only Time\\".<br /><br />The magical team Enya, comprising Enya (the composer/performer), Nicky Ryan (producer) and Roma Ryan (lyrics), does not disappoint with \\"Amarantine\\", a gorgeous album and a beautiful single.  The only problem with this album is that it's only twelve songs long, which won't keep us going for another five years.<br /><br />Mostly in English this time, three tracks are written in a new language similar to Elvish from \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", so there's no need to adjust your headphones or fiddle with your equalizer if you don't get some of the lyrics.<br /><br />Other than \\"Amarantine\\", the song \\"It's In the Rain\\" is the most memorable, evoking memories of \\"Only Time\\".  All the tracks are good, but the other stand outs are \\"The River Sings\\" (one of the Loxian language songs); \\"Long Long Journey\\" and \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\".<br /><br />A must-buy for any Enya or Clannad fan.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 26, 2005
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I find this album one of her best...with this album she proves that even dance music can be very elaborated, not only the beats you can dance to are the mainstream...and the fact that this album is a continous mix this makes Confessions on a Dance Floor even an original dance album...Madonna always knew how to make music and this time she proves again...The age doesn't matter...the quality is the most important thing that makes an artist a real artist.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Other than a few cuts I would add from Nomad and Vertigo, this compilation has most of the spectacular tunes Jesse Cook and friends have produced.  This is THE BARGAIN of the bunch.
006016848X|5.0|This book uses repetition, anecdotes, and simple English to get its points across, and its message is clear and easily applicable. I have been reading this book, then discussing a chapter each night with my husband. Although there are some statements that don't apply to either of us, Gray says in the introduction to ignore those parts and focus on the ones that you can relate to. Although I agree with others who said that this book is repetitive, it gives valuable common-sense insights into communicating with members of the opposite sex which unfortunately a lot of us just couldn't figure out for ourselves. <br /> <br />I read at least fifty of the reviews here before writing, and googled John Gray to read about the issue RE: his Ph.D. Its pretty obvious that he is quite a strange guy and doesn't really have a Ph.D. However, it doesn't change the fact that his book is extremely helpful to those of us who didn't have parents with a great marriage, siblings of the opposite sex, or great common sense to figure this stuff our on our own. <br /> <br />The other nay-sayers can be lumped into two groups: other authors talking crap about Mars/Venus to toot their own self-help-book horn, or people who the book didn't really apply to. I didn't read one review where a person tried to apply the common-sense knowledge gained from the book whose relationship suffered because of it. That's why I give it five stars-- easy read, simple, great common-sense advice.
B00000K3CK|4.0|I have to say I have seen the remake more times then this one but I like this one just as much. i like the acting,story and the directing. The problem is Susie I found her to be a spoiled brat. the story is cute as a girl dosnet believe in Santa Clause and a man says he's the real thing. the good thing about this movie is we dont know if he's the real thing becouse all the stuff he dose can be done. The movie is a fun original classic holiday film.
B00004R7TP|5.0|she's so incredible, sometimes it sounds like she's singing on the top of a mountain but she does that with no effect, her voice just belongs to another force, kate doesn't use the usual harmonies, she observes another path, another way to create music, very different and unusual and she pretty much created it so she's got even more credit.<br /><br />at the same time she's so british and that's lovely, she the best ambassador of england along with the beatles.<br /><br />kate you're the best, i love you.<br /><br />big sky is simply such a source of pure satisfaction.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I really enjoyed trhis movie and seen it twice in the theators and when it was over felt like clapping at the end. The movies about a man who is raised in the north pole and then sets out to find his real father who lives in New York. The movie has lots of funny moments. The acting is great and there is lots of great moments. One of the best christmas movies.
B000AY74OG|5.0|This was the best movie i've seen yet my i'de give ti a 1000000/5
B000002UDB|5.0|Saying this album is great is truely an understatement. This album is exactly what the title inquires MAGICAL. I love it and it is possibly the greatest Beatles album out there. The problem is how badly underrated and underappriciated it is. I just can't believe how it was never as great of a success as \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" when all the songs could have been great hits. <br /> <br />The NUMBER ONE thing I love about this album is that every song is actually that good! On most albums's I get those one or two songs I just can't stand to listen to and I have to rush to change it. I never had this problem with \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Let me break it down song by song from my opinions: <br /> <br /> <br />Magical Mystery Tour - The beat, the rhythm, the lyrics, are all perfect together, a very fun sing along song and it obviously wouldn't be the title song if it wasn't good. <br /> <br />The Fool On The Hill - Probably my favorite song, I love the lyrics and how they give off a \\"who cares what others think?\\" vibe. This song helps me as do all of Paul's songs do. If you like slow songs like Yesterday, Here There and Everywhere and I've Just Seen A Face, you will probably like this song too.   <br /> <br />Flying - It's an instrumental, and usually I don't like these, but this one is easy listening. <br /> <br />Blue Jay Way - I'm the biggest fan of George's songs. I love the eerieness of this one. Even though most people find it boring, I still think of it as one of his bests. A very easy listen as well. <br /> <br />Your Mother Should Know - I get scared because I always find myself singing along with this catchy tune, and I don't sing out loud often... I love the irony!  <br /> <br />I Am The Walrus - Many people have said it, and I'll say it again, \\"One Of John's Best\\". The lyrics have no meaning and are very bizarre which makes it an enjoyable and laidback track.  <br /> <br />Hello, Goodbye - Heard it on the \\"1\\" album first, definitly a catchy tune and obviously a great hit. I listen to it over and over still. <br /> <br />Strawberry Fields Forever - I must admit I didn't like this song the first time I heard it, but eventually after listening over and over, this song grew on me and I find it very soothing. <br /> <br />Penny Lane - Paul's upbeat song about Liverpool, everyone who loves the Beatles should love this song. First heard it on \\"1\\" as well. <br /> <br />Baby You're A Rich Man - This song is basically a combination of \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" and \\"I Am The Walrus\\". You find yourself singing along to the ridiculous lyrics and you just have to laugh at yourself.  <br /> <br />All You Need Is Love - Another song that should be loved by all Beatlemaniacs. I seriously can't listen to this song enough, it never gets tiring. Also on \\"1\\". <br /> <br />A lot of people think that this album wasn't a great hit because of Epstein's death, how the Beatles were \\"supposedly\\" under the influence of drugs at the time, how much it was overshadowed by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and because of the crappy movie it was soundtrack to. Well to sum it up I don't care that people though the Beatles were supposedly nothing and lacked direction without Epstein, or that they were intoxicated while making it, nor do I care if the movie sucked or not, as long as the music sounds good, I'm happy. I'm just your average listener, and I don't look too much into the production of something as I do into the product. <br /> <br />For what this album costs, (in the range of $13-$27) it's a worthwhile and substantial buy. If you don't believe me then break it down yourself:  <br /> <br />- Three of the songs were major hits. (Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane, and All You Need Is Love)  <br />- Two of the songs were Lennon's signature moments. (I Am The Walrus and Strawberry Fields Forever) <br />- Three of the songs are just for fun. (Magical Mystery Tour, Your Mother Should Know, and Baby You're A Rich Man) <br />- Three that are easy listenings. (The Fool On The Hill, Flying, and Blue Jay Way)  <br /> <br />And there you have it a mixture of enchanting music made by the most enchanting and magical band that there ever was, The Beatles.
B000000OSE|5.0|I love this album I think I love more then anyone no filler what so ever at least 2x better then AFD which is also amazing the way I see it these guys are not metal they are hard rock/classic rock I can see how after AFD this could be confused but after these two albums there is no question and like every good callsic rock band they have good ballads so they didn't go soft here that's just the way they are as far as making a best of both first it was actually done and second there may be 5 bad songs on each this album over all is a great mixture of heavy hitting rockers and beautiful ballids from a band with true tallent it also has the art rock factor which for a hard rock band to tap into makes some amazing music there is the songs everyone knows November Rain Don't Cry Live and Let Die ect but hidden gems like coma don't dame me and the not so known single dead horse make is album a must have my second favorite after stickey fingers by the rolling stones
B0007GAERG|1.0|I remember when Mariah had a good voice. I remember when Mariah wasn't a cash-in and when she cared about her fans. I remember when Mariah used to be a good POP artist without annoying rapping guests. Oh yeah, I remember. And you crazy fans do too. I'm not going to bother going on about whether Madonna or Mariah is better, because every true person out there knows who's sold more records and is a better and true artist to their fans (and it's not Mariah. Seriously. Go on Wikipedia on the best selling artists document and you'll see Madonna is number four; Mariah number seven.) Futhermore, Mariah is just going really bland now. I know she still has a great voice, though... Time to put it to good use for once in almost eleven year.
B000BKDOCA|4.0|Jive Records might not promote as much this remix compilation but it was rumoured to be or exist as an import album. At difference of many artists, Britney might have one of the most enjoyable and dance collections of any artist.  <br /> <br />She incluyeds some commercial remixes like the one Of Baby or Toxic Extended Version (the one that sound on clubs was a cut off and also some of them that weren't as much airplay as others. <br /> <br />Brit shouldn't be the biggest voice or something like that, but we can't denied that she is a true hit maker and also that she owns the most fun number of hits on radios and most of them have become also dance anthem. The remixes of this album have a lot of musical flexibility and provide a fun enviroment to her songs. Recommendable. I have to say also that I confused this as Bloom of Sarah McLahlan (coz of the Butterfly cover) and both are remix albums...that was just a coincidince.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|What!! Five stars? Completely deserving of it! Are you interested in buying this cd, is that why you're reading these reviews? On this site there have been a rash of one star ratings given to this cd (by Mariah Carey fans no less) please do yourself a favour and don't bother reading the one star reviews (if they should appear here). They honestly haven't listened to the cd. This cd represents Madonna at her best and it is her best offering to us in YEARS. I have yet to dislike a cd of hers. I even liked the \\"dreadful\\" American Life cd. It's not that I am incapable of disliking anything from her (there are certainly songs of hers that I dislike), it's just that as a whole her cds always work very well. This cd is no different. There are no less than eight stellar tracks here. Hung up, Sorry, I Love New York, Jump, How High, Isaac, Push and Like it or Not are melodic pieces of pop brilliance. The other four tracks are good, they're just not as good (IMO). There is no filler here either which is rare today. Time magazine, Billboard, MTV, NME, Rolling Stone, People magazine and US Weekly all gave this cd an excellent or good review (how can they all be wrong?).If you are a fan of Madonna (either a little or a lot) or a fan of pop/dance music you can not go wrong with the purchase of this cd. This I swear to you. Beware the haters out there who have nothing better to do than to tear down talented artists. Peace.  <br />
B000BNTM96|5.0|Y'know, it's kinda funny...every time a new QOTSA album comes out, Josh Homme always says the new band is 'the best lineup ever' or something along those lines. As a huge fan of Dave Grohl and someone who really appreciates what he contributed to SONGS FOR THE DEAF, I must say I was pretty dubious of Josh's claim this time.  <br />I needn't have worried. This version of Queens is a monster. <br />See, I highly dig LULLABIES..., but it doesn't really have a strong 'band' presence to it, probably due, I hate to admit it, to the absence of Nick Oliveri. What's good about this effect is that it really makes the strength of the songwriting stand out... <br />The great thing about this CD/DVD is that when a bunch of talented, tight and passionate musicians like the ones assembled here tear into these songs, they find all kinds of fresh new blood in those veins. Joey Castillo pounds the hell out of his kit, very ably stepping in for Mr. Grohl on the SONGS... songs, and propelling the new stuff into Rock God Valhalla. It's also awesome to watch Troy Van Leeuwen and Alain Johannes from Eleven and The Desert Sessions trade off instruments like the virtuosos they are. Natash Shneider (also of Eleven and the Desert Sessions) adds just the right elements, musically and aesthetically, and the JoshMan himself is in perfect form, whether firing off a face-melting solo, hitting all the targets with that laser-perfect falsetto, or verbally destroying a would-be heckler who tries to ruin the show. <br />Oh, and a note to Travis: <br />Enough already with the 'hardcore fan' routine. If you're really a hard-core fan of QOTSA, you would know that Nick Oliveri wasn't an original member, although he did come to be an important collaborator with Josh Homme. Look, Nick is awesome and all, but he's also a crazy motherf***er who got kicked out of the DWARVES, for cryin' out loud. I wouldn't believe anything he said in some rock rag any more than I would believe any of Josh's myriad versions ofevents. It was personal, it was business, but it wasn't OUR business. The QOTSA flag flys with Josh, so love it or leave it, just like Oliveri. <br />P.S. Looks like Mark Lanegan didn't get fired after all, doesn't it? <br /> <br />
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mariah is such a cash-in. First she releases the original comeback, followed by the Limited Edition, followed by two Platinum Editions!--One with a DVD, one without. How sad does the bloody tart want to get!?  <br /> <br />But wait. I wouldn't even think about buying this! In atleast four months she'll be releasing, like, the Super Duper 10 Times Million Ultra Ultra Ultra edition of the album. As always, it will include the same old 14 songs available on the Original album. What's the point?
B0002K6YY4|5.0|This is fast becoming a classic to last the ages.  Not only are the tracks great musically but the lyrics are so heartfelt and meaningful as well.  The tracks flow along very nicely and there are no noticeable fillers or weak tracks here.  The sound quality is very good and the bass is killer!  However, the only distinctive feature of this version over the normal one is that the disc itself resembles an old vinyl lp which to me isn't really a big deal.  If they made the cover a mini-lp sleeve package then perhaps it'll be worth paying the extra bucks.  A very good hip-hop/r&b album which is destined to outlast the others over time and become a classic.  Highly recommended although you may want to get the cheaper version which probably sounds just as good unless you really need the old vinyl lp-looking disc which I kinda doubt that you do.  Also, the track listing on this site for some reason includes two bonus tracks which are really not on the disc and so it's not like you're paying extra for bonus tracks either.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Confessions On A Dance Floor is already really popular! Not only is Madge back, but she's back to stay, and back to rule the world. There are literally no bad tracks on this album, and most of the negative reviews posted on here are by no other than Mariah Carey's fans - members of TeamLamb, I say... The first single, Hung Up, has already became a number one hit in more than twenty places in the world, whereas the album has became a mega-hit worldwide, going onto sell four million in its first ten days, and opening Charts at pole position in over twenty-five countries in the Globe.  <br /> <br />HUNG UP <br />When I first heard Madonna was recording a dance album, I though, great! I couldn't have been more happier. When I heard she was sampling Abba's Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, and also working with the ultimate dance meister Stuart Price, I was over-joyed. When I heard the song on the radio, I though, hmm...catchy song. The album version is ten times better! I love the part where the music goes down low to build back up again. Fantastic opener! <br /> <br />GET TOGETHER <br />Where Madonna used the 70s sound sampling on Hung Up, from this song foward, Madonna tries to create the future disco sound. She pulls it off! This is yet another fantastic song which should not be missed. I really hope this one becomes a single. Speaking of which... <br /> <br />SORRY <br />...is the second single from the album. It's one of my favourites from the whole album, actually. Definate top three pic. Madonna speaks of how she's heard all of her boyfriends excuses before, while constantly repeating, I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before, etc, etc. Great song! <br /> <br />FUTURE LOVERS <br />In the evidence of its brilliance, this song is great! Madonna samples Donna Summer's I Feel Love here, and the spoken parts are particularly effective! Fabulous! <br /> <br />I LOVE NEW YORK <br />This song has caused a massive amount of chaos and controversy on Amazon, and I can see why.This is probably the worst song on the album, and the lyrics are so bad. That being said, I was a little dissapointed, because this song was literally hyped before the album came out. Stuart saves the song with his amazing dance beats! <br /> <br />LET IT WILL BE <br />This song is somewhat stripped-down and relaxed yet shaky and you can still dance to it. This one is definately a top five pic. Madonna repeats the title track alot, but this makes it unique. Somehow, the music in the song at the beginning reminds me of Die Another Day a little bit.  <br /> <br />FORBIDDEN LOVE <br />The name of this song was originally placed in Madonna's 1994 album Bedtime Stories. This one isn't the same song. It's a completely different song, with different lyrics, and obviously, a dance beat. The originally song was an uptempo ballad. Great effort. <br /> <br />JUMP <br />This one is said to be the third single from the album. Madonna uses lyrics like get ready to jump, and I can tell you now, you will be jumping with this song! Madonna delivers her vocals perfectly as normal, and Stuart continues to amaze me with his music! <br /> <br />HOW HIGH <br />This song expresses Madonna's robotic voice more than anything else. The lyrics are quite clever. It uses the words nobody's perfect and I guess I deserve it - they are both songs of Madonna's from her Music album. Fantastic song. <br /> <br />ISAAC <br />This song has been dubbed herendous by a few people (not on this site - it's a favourite on here!), inapropriate and the worst song on the album. It's certainly not! This would be yet another top three pic for me. I love it when Madge takes risks like this. This is your Ray Of Light song. I love the Kallabah-ness going on in this song. Just excellent! <br /> <br />PUSH <br />This is the second song Madonna has dedicated to her husband, Guy Ritchie. The first was from her 2000 Music album in the name of I Deserve It. This song is brilliant, but it's not one of my favourites. <br /> <br />LIKE IT OR NOT <br />The perfect closure. This is my number one choice from the album. It's a fantastic song, but music is brilliant, and the lyrics are overwhleming. Need I say more? <br />
B000005H4H|3.0|This is a wonderful debut for Herbie and clearly shows the influence of Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\" as well as provides hints of \\"Bitches Brew\\" in a couple of tracks as well i.e. modal work plus hints of the avant-garde.  Freddie Hubbard does some great work here and so does Coleman on sax with Herbie expertly supporting on piano.  The first and last tracks are the strongest although there really isn't a weak track here.  However, this version, unlike the clearly inaccurate product description, is not the Japanese mini-lp sleeve remastered version and hence could use this very treatment.  My recommendation is to get the remastered version of this worthy addition to any jazz lover's cd collection.
B000065PUE|5.0|Before I begin this review, I just have to say:<br /><br />Janitor-X, you are a complete moron. Normally, I would never stoop so low as to attack another reviewer, but in your case, it simply could not be avoided. Your 1-star review of Doolittle (posted December 25th, 2004), as well as negative reviews of other excellent alt/indie albums such as Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain, OK Computer, Loveless, Disintegration, and Odelay only proves how ignorant and warped your view of alternative music is. I've read through all your reviews, and it seems that you're nothing more than a too-cool-for-school \\"underground\\" meathead who hates alternative music because it isn't \\"totally heavy and brutal\\" like all the hardcore and metal you obsess over.  You're an EXCELLENT writer, but your opinions and claims are so retarted, that the First Amendment shouldn't even apply to you. Anyone who gives 1 star to a Pixies album, and then gives 5 stars to albums by Norma Jean and KoRn (WTF?!) deserves to be shot. And then dragged on their asses through a field of broken glass. And then have salt poured in their wounds. And then shot again.<br /><br />That being said, Doolittle is one of the greatest albums ever made. Surfer Rosa was an astonishing debut, but Doolittle is what truly elevated The Pixies to rock God status, alongside The Beatles and The Who. This sophomore effort stretches The Pixies' sound in some pretty odd ways: the Beach Boys-worthy pop hooks make it more accessible than Surfer Rosa, but at the same time, it leans much more towards the experimental side, with more inventive percussion, arena and surf rock riffs, and more unusual vocal harmonies.<br /><br />Every song will have you humming along within seconds, especially the chorus of \\"Wave Of Mutilation\\" and the tropical island-esque guitar playing on \\"Here Comes Your Man\\". Weezer could only dream of making alternative rock singalongs like this. Fortunately, The Pixies also keep many of the less sane elements that made their first album such a classic, and it doesn't get much better than Black Francis screaming hilarious lyrics like \\"GOT ME A MOVIE! A HA HO HO! SLICIN' UP EYEBALLS! A HA HO HO!\\" in the album's best song, \\"Debaser\\".<br /><br />Any rock critic will tell you that Nirvana is the greatest alternative band ever, but anyone whose heard The Pixies knows the truth. Surfer Rosa and Doolittle were released around the time I was born, and they haven't aged a day, unlike Nevermind, which often sounds indistinguishable from the waves of quasi-grunge (Nickelback, Creed, etc.) that plagued the radio a few years ago. Perhaps it's fate's way of punishing Cobain for stealing from the Pixies? I wouldn't be surprised.ic, and it doesn't get much better than Black Francis screaming hilarious lyrics like \\"GOT ME A MOVIE! A HA HO HO! SLICIN' UP EYEBALLS!

B00000JHAU|5.0|The spotlight reviewers above are nothing more than washed up self proclaimed indie hipsters who have lost sight of what good music is. They are too blindsided by the indie music they experienced for the first time as youths and their thinly veiled criticisms only serve to reveal just how old and out of touch with music they have become (pathetic!). They think that this album is not original because they read in some \\"trendy\\" magazine or heard from their \\"trendy\\" friends that it sounded like their classic 80's indie bands they cherish and were disappointed when they found it did not live up to the hype... all ranting aside, my point is that it doesn't matter whether Belle and Sebastian's sound is 100% original or not, it's the music that matters. <br /> <br />Considering that rock and roll has been around for such a long time, comparisons are inevitably going to be made to earlier bands - but that doesn't mean the music of Belle and Sebastian should be graded more harshly because it doesn't sound like the second coming of one band or another. <br /> <br />I am judging this by the music alone, not whether it stacked up to classic indie bands (of which I do not even care to hear anymore). I ENJOY the songs on this album. I like the album as a whole. In terms of specific tracks, I enjoy \\"Dylan in the movies\\", \\"Seeing other people\\", and \\"Get me away from here...\\" the most. Musically, I find it to be very relaxing and the lead singer's voice adds to this. Throwing all comparisons to other bands aside, I asked myself if I liked the music on this record, and I did, so I gave it five stars. Don't disregard this album because the top reviews were harsh. I enjoyed it.
B000005JAB|5.0|This album may easily qualify as my favourite John Cale album (a toss up between Paris 1919, Fear, and Honi Soit).  Granted, it's not much like the other two albums cited, and probably has more in common with Vintage Violence.  Paris 1919 shows a much more tender side to Mr. Cale, and because of this, the album almost seems to coddle you through the speakers.  It seems to be a reminiscent whiff, an attempt at recapturing certain moods and atmospheres, all of which make this album feel very familiar.  This is not to say that there aren't more melancholic or upbeat moments; but regardless of individual songs, the overall impression given is of some tender longing, some whistful moodiness, and a hint of subtle menace here and there.      As other reviewers have mentioned, Mr. Cale is backed by the core of Little Feat (Lowell George, Ritchie Hayward, Bill Payne) adding superb musicianship to the mix on favourite tracks like \\"A Child's Christmas in Wales\\", \\"Hanky Panky Knowhow\\", \\"Andalucia\\", \\"Macbeth\\", and \\"Antarctica Starts Here\\".  Though it's only about half an hour, this album is definitely worth the price of admission and would make a splendid introduction to the ouevre of Mr. Cale.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|After the huge succes of 'Mezmerize', one would suspect that the second part could only be worse. Wonderfully enough, it isn't.  <br />'Hypnotize' has the same stylistic approach as it's counterpart, but it's clearly the darker part of the double-album. The amount of catchy, comical songs has been reduced and the overall vibe is dark, sad, haunting and melodic. Because of this, 'Hypnotize' is a bit harder to digest and less accessible then its predecessor. So listening to it more then once and letting it all sink in might be a good idea if you want to get the entire picture. But does that mean it's a bad album? Not at all. <br /> <br />Like on 'Mezmerize', Daron sings again a lot on this album. To me, it's a nice addition to Systems sound. It adds great new contrasts to the music. Both singers shine in their lead parts (altough Serj is clearly the better singer here) and their harmonizing parts are simply perfect. <br />The music sounds as good as ever, combining agressive riffs with melodic interludes (and even a few gentle solo's). <br />Overall, this is a very strong and original record indeed. Like you can expect from a SOAD-abum, it's filled with fast riffs, crazy tempo-shifts, fantastic melodies, various styles of music and goofy absurdism. And somehow, it still all works. <br /> <br />Combined with 'Mezmerize', this is one of the best rock-albums of the 21st century. <br /> <br />Album highlights: <br /> <br />-Attack. This song opens the album with a bang. Very heavy song dominated by Serj, who sounds outstanding. The melodic interruptions are very good too. <br /> <br />-Dreaming. This is one of the best songs. It's a pretty complex one, with fast-paced guitars and different vocal melodies running trough each other during the verses and a great chorus. The gentle bridge contains Darons best vocal performance on the album. <br /> <br />-Stealing society. A nice, up-beat punk-ish song with very nice vocals from both Daron and Serj. <br /> <br />-Holy mountains. The best song on the record, and one of the best songs SOAD ever made. Very epic, melodic and haunting with a fantastic chorus and a great main-riff. <br /> <br />-Vicinity of Obscenity. One of the weirdest songs ever made. Absurd lyrics, crushing riffs and a weird disco interlude (!). Great stuff! <br /> <br />-Soldier side. The complete song of the 'Mezmerize' intro. This is a very powerfull, deep and emotional song. It's amazing. <br /> <br />Yes, that's half of the album. And the other half is great too. :-)
0553801503|2.0|\\"A Feast for Crows\\" is frankly speaking a disappointment. The novel really doesn't go anywhere much - its a huge tome in which events progress at a glacial speed and is abruptly ended leaving the reader with a sinking feeling of dissatisfaction and irritation. The pace, action and verve that had you at the edge of your seats in the earlier books is prominently absent here.<br /><br />I believe it was a very big mistake to cut this work into two books. There is reams of redundancy that would have<br /><br />better served the author's purpose by simply being chopped off, and it would have been a much better idea to include the complete material to bring the storyline to some sort of intermediate conclusion - a poise the earlier books achieved magnificently leaving the reader gasping for more, and which this one completely misses - despite drawling for over a thousand pages.<br /><br />The tales of some of the invidual characters are drawn out excruciatingly long. Pet peeves include:<br /><br />-The journey of Sam to the citadel takes the whole book, when it shouldn't have taken more than a chapter or two.<br /><br />-The machinations of Pietr at the Eyerie and his conversations with Sansa. These could have been summarized in paragraphs. Nothing of event happens here except that Pietr informs Sansa that she can marry a lord who is hier after Robert to the Eyerie. And this is given in a page of reasoning towards the end!<br /><br />-Nothing much of import happens with Arya stark either. She gives up her identity, serves at the temple, sells seafood and bumps into Sam enroute to Oldtown without him knowing who she is.<br /><br />-Half tales of the experiences of the Dornish princesses that don't lead anywhere.<br /><br />-Brienne searching all the time for Sansa, getting to know information about Arya that leads her to Catelyn Stark instead. Again a *lot* of time wasted on this ironical circle - it could have been *compressed*.<br /><br />-None of the characters who have brought 'pace' are present. No Jon and no Daenerys (who just happens to be my favourite character).<br /><br />Martin states that it is a better idea to tell 'all the story' for half the characters, rather than the other way around. The problem is that 'all the story' is very minimal here. It would have been *much* better to tell 'all the story' story as it progresses in this book for *all* the characters - chopping the<br /><br />more boring experiences of some of the characters. In short his decision was a *very* big mistake - and nearly all readers will agree with this once they have crawled their way over a thousand pages.<br /><br />Ofcourse the book has a lot about everybody's favourite bad character - Cersei Lannister, on how her very own decisions as Queen, made in vindictiveness and apathy land her in grave trouble and her subsequent incarceration. It was good to read about Cersei - they are no levels she won't sink to - so you can never tell what she will do. :-)<br /><br />As I re-read what I just wrote, I suddenly realize that the above just about summarizes what happens in the whole book! Events of any note are few and far in between and this book just doesn't have the breathtaking change and scope of the earlier works.<br /><br />To be fair, I would have given this book 3 stars - its strictly average, but some of the fanatical (and abusive) five star ratings given here get my blood boiling.<br /><br />I just hope Martin isn't falling into the familiar trap of the fantasy writer - stretch and drawl out stories into endless sequels - a road that Robert Jordan has traversed to his readers grief.sent.

(adjectives, gender, etc) After a few chapters, you will feel that you are starting to learn russian. While some russian language programs seem to leave out important concepts, this book covers the why and how so you know why sentences and words are organized a certain way in russian. After that, it is up to you to learn the vocabulary. But with the information taught in these lessons, you will know how to use the words as opposed to just memorizing them.
B00005JK8K|5.0|I have read lots of the reviews from other customers, and all I have to say is, if you can't spell, how can you even rate a movie?I like this movie because it tells me about a time in history that I knew nothing about. It gives credit where credit is due, to my Native American brothers who were heroes once again.I was very pleased with the cast and thought they did an excellent job in the portrayal of the characters they played.Also, have you ever directed a movie? It is a difficult job, and should not be criticized unless you have done a better job in your life.And all I have to say is Adam Beach you rule! I would like to see him in more movies.
B000BGR0OM|4.0|From Smother Magazine - [...]<br /><br />While some will dismiss this as the record company's or band's way of cashing in on the renewed interest in New Wave and `80's pop, I'd like to put my foot down and say it's about time that this album was released. Eurythmics always boasted some incredible hit singles but their albums sometimes dwindled into production wizardry so much that their other songs got boring and tired. Here on \\"Ultimate Collection\\" there's no fodder, no filler, nothing but the cream of the crop. \\"Love Is a Stranger\\" is just as powerful a ballad as it was back in the day. Of course what would a look at the Eurythmics be without \\"Sweet Dreams [Are Made of This]\\"? That song was so good even Marilyn Manson could sound cool covering it. The album also contains some new songs that show how progressive the outfit has become. Annie Lennox to this day is still just as powerful a singer as she ever was but now she's armed with the maturity to write a full album of great hits and not just have two to five bright spots.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I dig the thrash, the solos and the song structures.  They put on a great live show too. <br /> <br />I guess I'm not tired of this genre. Its my favorite. Theres always room for a Pantera/metallica spin-off for me.  I just don't get sick of those who can sing close to phil's style and jam like those bands.  In my book, either you can hang with those bands and I like it, or you fall short by sounding like confused crap (Korn, disturbed, godsmack etc).   <br />
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Nice.  But why are some works from such artists so brief (46 minutes of music?).  There are 12 tracks though a 13th track exists somewhere out there (# 13: Mansoon Chariot) for some select group of individuals.  <br /> <br />It's worth the price just to have in your collection for completeness.  But, like I said, it is like eating in a five star restaurant: small portions of incredible flavors that entice and excite the senses.  None-the-less, even though the experience was wonderful, when the last course comes and it's at the end of the meal, you feel like you needed something more to eat to feel completely satisfied.  <br /> <br />That is what comes to mind with Amarantine.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Buddy is a human that as an orphan baby stowed away in Santa's sack. Raised by Elves, he's intelligent but naive and filled with delight over everything. He learns that he's NOT an Elf and told of his real father (his mother having died). So he journey's to New York to meet his father and discover his identity. <br /> <br />Buddy in New York is a mixture of delight and embarrassment for the viewer.  He meets his father (who is on the naughty list) and his step-mother and step-brother. He finds a woman he cares for and with his elfish upbringing brings joy and laughter to all he meets. But he is treated as a jerky, unstable fool.  In spite of his treatment, he continues to enjoy all life has to give.  And in the end there's a scene that not since you had to clap hands to save Tinkerbell has there been a more tear-jerky family participation scene in a film. <br /> <br />It's great to bring a family together to talk about the true meaning of Christmas and the Christmas spirit.  I started watching the film expecting the usual over the top sugar coated Christmas film and was surprised to find it while definitely over the top to also have heart and soul and to be worth more than the story it told.  Watch and enjoy.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|If you look at other countries besides the United States Madonna has far more #1 singles.  <br /> <br />In the United Kingdom Madonna has had 10 #1 singles compared to Mariah's 2 #1 singles. If you keep looking at Canada, Germany, France, Australia, and even more countries besides  those, Madonna has three or four times more #1 singles in other nations than Mariah.  <br /> <br />Stop the myth that Mariah has more #1 singles! She doesn't. If you look at just America Mariah does, but overall, more people like Madonna and her songs worldwide.  <br /> <br />STOP THE MYTH. GET INFORMED.   <br /> <br />As for the CD... <br /> <br />Madonna has returned to the dance floor with her new album, Confessions on a Dance Floor that dropped in stores Tuesday, November 15th. This album encompasses all of what made Madonna the most successful female artist to date. It has fun lyrics and catchy, upbeat, powerfulsongs. <br /> <br />The songs on this album that are sure to get you out of your seat and dance are \\"Jump,\\" \\"Push\\" and her first single off of this album, \\"Hung Up.\\" Other memorable songs on this album are \\"I love New York,\\" where Madonna pledges her love for New York city in a very catchy way, \\"How High\\" which focuses on her career and making it to the top, \\"Isaac\\" which in-composes her religion Kabala and \\"Sorry\\" where she creates yet another catchy song about love which will debut as her second single off of this album.
1597371378|5.0|As an unabridged edition, all of Alcott's words are there.  The narrator, Sandra Burr, takes us through the classic work in a style that takes the listener inside the story.  Voices for the different characters are all created, but never in a melodramatic fashion.  Listening to the story is like watching a fine and faithful production
B00097DXZS|5.0|Not wanting to tinkle too much with a winning formula, Santana return with another star studded collection, the follow up to the multi platinum successes of `Supernatural' and `Shaman'. Here, we get folk like the ubiquitous Mary J Blige, Joss Stone, Outkast's Big Boi, and Sean Paul to mention a few. I was initially hesitant to buy this after reading scathing reviews, but found it cheap and took the chance. I like it a lot, it is a grower.<br /><br />Standouts to me are the heavily latin-laced numbers; the fiery opening track `Hermes', `El Fuego', the celebratory horn filled `Con Santana', `Da Tu Amor' (I love that percussion), and `I don't wanna lose your love' featuring Los Lonely Boys. I wish they would do more stuff like this.<br /><br />`Brown skin girl' is a stunning mid tempo song featuring the wonderful voice of Bo Bice. My favourite!<br /><br />`I am somebody' is a song of self belief/assertion featuring will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas. `My man' features Mary J Blige on vocals with Big Boy supplying some rapping. Think Marvin Gaye with Carlos Santana's wailing guitar and you get the picture.<br /><br />Other good songs are the reggae tinged `Cry baby cry' with Joss Stone and Sean Paul, Michelle Branch (she was on `Shaman') on the tender pop `I'm feeling you', and Anthony Hamilton on `Twisted'.<br /><br />P.S., I don't have any problem with the copy protection on the CD, I was able to rip it on my pc and transfer to my iPod. Maybe I was lucky???
B0009SOFGI|5.0|[...]\\"The Stooges\\" is a fine album.  Anyone interested in checking out The Stooges for the first time should start off with this album.  \\"1969\\" to \\"Little Doll,\\" every track is excellent Rock and Roll.  It grooves a lot better than \\"Fun House,\\" which is another good album.  Iggy's raw and raunchy vocals, combined with that down and dirty wah-wah effect, make \\"The Stooges\\", if anything, perfect sex music.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Yes, its' only a RECONSTRUCTION of the \\"Holy Grail\\" of all stop-motion animation--but it is MASTERFULLY executed by Peter Jackson and colleagues...with ONE reservation.<br /><br />Since I went directly to the Sequence at the bottom of Disc 2's menu (as opposed to the chapter in the full documentary), I thought I was watching the REAL THING!! I was awestruck...and yet I had one teeny, tiny reservation about it that helped give it away.<br /><br />These guys went through amazingly painstaking, detailed work to reconstruct the scene. They studied and compared the original script with other scenes in the film to establish the \\"rhythmical\\" relationship between printed word and finished film, intentionally LIMITED themselves to the technology of 1932 in armature building and all other aspects of the animation, including stick-like miniatures of the sailors fighting the horrors of the pit, slightly imperfect matte lines under the big spider, etc, they X-RAYED the original 1932 Styracosaurus puppet in order to recreate it's exact construction, they produced a FLAWLESS recreation of the jungle in all of its textures, details and lighting, FLAWLESS integration of sound effects and music track, intentional \\"degeneration\\" of the new footage to match up with the original----<br /><br />SO, considering ALL of this incredible work, WHY didn't they<br /><br />cast the sailor's roles to match up as NEARLY AS POSSIBLE with the actors in the original....ESPECIALLY their COSTUMES!!?  Why go through all of the other work that I've mentioned, only to APPROXIMATE the sailors themselves?  C'mon, guys...I could have done a better job matching up the costumes!  Most notable is the guy who becomes spider food--the one wearing the striped \\"sailor\\" t-shirt.  In the original film, the shirt is CLEARLY non-white in tone--it looks like it may have been a brownish color--and the stripes are VERY THIN;  that should have been SIMPLE to recreate, especially compared to the rest of what they accomplished!  THe guy in the reconstruction is wearing a typical short-sleeved shirt--rather floppy (instead of tight-fitting), with a bright white background (instead of brownish) and big, wide stripes (instead of thin).<br /><br />Am I being too picky? I don't think so, considering the absolute<br /><br />perfection of the overall illusion these guys created.<br /><br />But it's still fabulous! You will NOT believe your eyes....it's the closest we'll ever get to seeing this sensational lost sequence from the greatest, most outrageous fantasy film of all time!hed!

B000B8QEYC|1.0|I have been a long-time admirer of Enya's gorgeous work for many years. Her celestial melodies, unique arrangements and singular voice have provided me with hours of listening pleasure for more than a decade. But as the years and her albums have come and gone, there is one glaring truth about Enya's work that has become ever more apparent--that her growth as an artist has been disturbingly minimal at best. Of course, this is not to say that her recordings have not progressed in any way. Her otherwordly sound and image have become ever more slick. But such advancement is growth on a lateral level at most--one must assume this being the result of an effort to secure her worldwide legion of fans with a predictable output, one that will guarantee her placment as #1 on the New Age charts for years at a time. Even so, each of Enya's previous albums have offered more than a few memorable tracks that remain enjoyable after years of playing. So 'Amarantine' is a terrible disappointment in its almost total lack of anything worthwhile save for what amounts to less than a handful of, at best, mediocre pieces. And so lacklustre, not to mention brief, is the album overall that it borders on insult to fans who have waited more than five years since her last major release. So routine are the songs on 'Amarantine' as to resemble nothing more than alternate versions of previously released tracks--these being the ones that were wisely dropped. But in the end, none of these criticisms will really matter much to Enya's cult who will embrace this album with stars in their eyes and a total lack of discrimination in their ears. I must admit, if I found a way to make enough millions to afford me a splendid life in a spectacular castle as Enya has through her music machine, I, too, would churn out such unchallenging dreck as this latest release as well. But I would hope not have the audacity to call myself a musical artist. Perhaps 'sausage-maker tunesmith' has more of a ring of truth to it.Congratulations, Enya, keep smiling that vacant and knowing smile. You've fooled almost everyone.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I first saw Michael Buble at the Blue Note - one of his first big gigs, I think, back in 2003. It was obvious from his first note that he was a gifted, funny, enthusiastic singer, with great rapport - and respect - for his audience. I saw him again in Boston at Scullers, then at Foxfoods in CT, where the band and the arrangements were becoming more powerful and dynamic and, finally, at the Beacon in NYC, where his show blew the lid off the place.  The audiences, of all ages, had grown, and so had his talent and ease on stage. What is amazing is how he is able to bridge several musical genres - and make them all come alive for such a diverse audience. The standout songs, among many, are \\"Home,\\" his own composition, \\"Sway,\\" the Dean Martin classic; \\"A Song For You,\\" which is given an absolutely superb treatment; and \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" with the famous Nelson Riddle arrangement. And so many more. This CD/DVD literally captures it all and, best of all, leaves you wanting more.  The songs and arrangements are given first class treatment. The musicians are all top shelf - and are themselves given opportunities to shine beyond their musical gifts. And then, of course, there is Buble himself - directly in line with the best, Sinatra, Crosby, Bennett, you name it.  He has complete command of his material and his joy and humor make him one of our best entertainers. He should have his own weekly variety show. Or a series of specials.<br /><br />When this terrific DVD is finally shown on PBS, it will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship between this star and his growing audience. For the price, you simply cannot go wrong here: an absolutely terrific DVD concert, almost as good as seeing Buble live, and a collection of 8 live tunes that will instantly put you into a great mood. He's the Sinatra of our day - and we need him.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I found myself wishing the dvd would go on for another 2 hours! <br />Caught In The Act is sizzling hot Buble' at his best. His timing and showmanship are only bettered by his singing which is heavenly. <br />Fast or slow, happy or sad, Michael B. sings each song so well it has to be heard to be appreciated. Amazingly talented he is. <br />The extra's are the added treat and include Chris Botti's fabulous horn in a duet with M.B.  <br />Today in my car I played the live cd over and over and just wished there was more where that came from. Charlie Chaplin's Smile is so good, it starts slow and BANG - it's just swinging as only Buble' can do. <br />I'm buying tickets to his upcoming Las Vegas shows -- I've got to hear more and soon!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is an AMAZING musical!  Just like one of its songs, it \\"Defys Gravity\\"!  Before seeing Wicked I wasn't really into Broadway shows.  This show swept me off of my feet.

There isn't one song on this CD that I have not played 1,000 times!  My favorites have to be:<br /><br />Dancing Through Life- It makes you want to get up and dance!<br /><br />Popular- You will be laughing so hard, that you'll be crying!<br /><br />I'm Not That Girl- A song for everyone about unreturned love<br /><br />Defying Gravity- All I have to say is WOW! Idina is AMAZING!<br /><br />For Good- What a beautiful song about friendship!<br /><br />No CD collection is complete without Wicked!  Its one of the BEST CDs EVER!

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Batman Begins easily makes itself more important and more of an event than any other Batman film in history.    Here is where we finally see everything that turned the orphan boy into the Caped Crusader and Dark Knight, with excellent supporting acts by Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, Gary Oldman  as Jim Gordon, and even the superb Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth. The only downside is Katie Holmes as Rachel who spends most of the film preaching and acting self righteous. Definitely nowhere near the glamour of Kim Basinger or  Nicole Kidman.    The film  is fresh and original and  ends with the possibility of a sequel  so perhaps this is only a new  beginning than a final coda for this legendary crimefighter.    I have not delved into the actual plot  as there are more than  enough reviews that do that.  But believe me when I say,  BATMAN BEGINS is the start of a new and exciting chapter in the  life of  Bob Kane's creation.   So please dont miss out and  order Batman Begins from amazon.com at once!!
B0000C0FJB|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but I felt like I had to on this one. I didn't give a damn about Rush until I heard this 3 years ago, and I became an instant fan. There are so many incredible songs on here, and the band's performance is in that realm-beyond-description - think of every superlative you know and throw 'em in right here.  <br />I recently listened to the R30 DVD+CD release at a friend's house, and came away pretty underwhelmed. Then I went back and listened to the Rio discs, and was all the more stunned (again)- I finally understood why they had to release this concert, even though they'd already put out \\"Different Stages\\" a few years before. It's just one of those all time great, never-again-to-be-duplicated moments. (By the way, different stages sucks by comparison!)  <br />Don't listen to all the dorks whining about the sound quality. Get this and prepare to be floored.
B0000524CY|5.0|Often voted such, The Exorcist deserves it, nearly in its own class.  The 'true story' of a Georgetown boy, who suffered some type of mental or spiritual disturbance the Church could not explain, would perhaps not bear close scrutiny as 'possession.'  But this film is not to prove or explain demonic possession.  Friedkin instead presents an essay on the nature of evil. <br /> <br />The film begins in Egypt, where Von Sydow's 'Exorcist' excavates artifacts that turn out to be emblems of the devil.  Friedkin shows the devil has always been with man, at least as a form of his own fear or evil nature.  Notice though, that Friedkin pans the Priest's exit, with several men bowing to Mecca, as if the Priest himself is a deity.  Is belief in the power of God among us different than the belief the Devil exists among us? <br /> <br />The Egyptian scene is not explained further, though it frames the entire movie, with its theme revisited when it ties into the very last scene, again nearly without dialogue.  The last scene is of the empty Georgetown stairwell and alley ways which earlier were so full of evil.  As if evil is a force just below the surface of the world we inhabit, waiting to burst forth again throughout time. <br /> <br />The chaos in the house between these endpieces, is of course the famous demonic possession- the revolving head, spider walk (cut scene), and crucifix 'usage' by the young girl. Both Sydow's 'The Exorcist', and the actual exorcist Miller who defeats the devil, are played to perfection.  Their performances and the way Friedkin just leaves the camera on them allowing the viewer to absorb thair personality, is not seen today in film. <br /> <br />The DVD extras present Friedkin and writer Blatty talking about technical aspects, and some themes, though the visuals say more than either can.  Like many artists, Friedkin is a genius in his medium, but comes across dull otherwise.   <br /> <br />Confirming this view of Friedkin's purpose in The Exorcist,to explore evil as a latent omnipotent prescense, is his failed attempt at the same theme in Cruising.  In that 1979 debacle, a murderous force transfers from person to person, as far as I or anyone can figure out.  Even Friedkin could not duplicate The Exorcist, by far his best work.
0553801503|4.0|Well, all I have to say is this: <br />Look at the writing, people! <br />GRRM still has his touch- even though you may not appreciate your favorite character's absence in this story (get over it, they'll be back in #5), the writing and plot-crafting is absolutely amazing. For all those who think the long chapters were extraneous, I strongly believe that, just like all the imagery and subplotting in the first three books, the \\"tougher\\" parts of this book will all make sense. Just give him a little time.
B000641ZA4|5.0|For anyone who is a fan of the group Genesis. I just got their DVD called \\"The Video Show\\" and all I can say is WOW! 32 of their videos!!! Everything from 1976 to 1999! I never realized how many of these videos I had either not seen or have only seen once or twice in my life. Back when MTV played videos I remember seeing the videos for \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"Land Of Confusion\\" and \\"That's All\\" a lot! Then years ago I had VH1 Classics and they played the videos like \\"No Son Of Mine\\", \\"Hold On My Heart\\", \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\", \\"Throwing It All Away\\", \\"In Too Deep\\", \\"Illegal Alien\\", \\"Abacab\\", and \\"Mama\\" a good bit.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|When I got wind that Madonna was finally releasing some new material, initial reports were that it was going to be her \\"Rock album\\" a la Franz Ferdinand and Killers. So wasn't I surprised to hear later reports that not only was she not going Rock, but that her new release was actually going to be a straight-up Dance album! <br /> <br />I was a little nervous about the whole thing after the somewhat disappointing Music and the tepid reaction to American Life. Although I loved that album, despite it's #1 debut, it was clear the rest of the world was not in agreement (despite, again, the fact it includes seven, yes seven, Top 10 dance singles). <br /> <br />Maybe this is why she decided to get back to her roots, as they say, and give the people what they want. An album to pop on to dance around the room and forget the world exists. <br /> <br />I certainly had no need to be worried. <br /> <br />Madonna has returned to the dance floor, and she has come back with a vengeance. <br /> <br />The album kicks starts in overdrive with the blistering ABBA-sampled lead-off single, \\"Hung Up,\\" her best single in years, and doesn't let up for the first nine songs of the album! The album includes two of the best songs she has ever recorded, \\"Sorry\\" (rumoured to be the second single and the best mainstream dance track she has recorded since \\"Vogue\\") and \\"Forbidden Love\\" (not to be confused with the song of the same name from her Bedtime Stories album). It also includes a song which is a wink at her very own \\"Holiday,\\" as \\"Get Together\\" is seemingly loosely based on the groove that threw Madonna onto the edge of superstardom twenty-two years ago. <br /> <br />Honestly, there are nine seriously strong tracks on this album of twelve. Each one has it's own feel, it's own vibe, but each one with a killer beat. <br /> <br />I feel she lost her footing a little by putting the \\"spiritual\\" track \\"Isaac\\" on here. It seems very ill-placed on the album and is definitely, by far, the weakest track on the album, but not nearly as big a blemish as \\"I'm So Stupid\\" was to American Life. \\"Let it Will be\\" and \\"Like it or Not\\" (produced by Bloodshy & Avant, best known for producing Britney Spears' worst single, \\"Toxic\\"), although two sufficiently good songs, are forgettable in the long run in comparison to the other nine slammin' tracks. The fact that nine of twelve are strong, however, is far more than most albums can say these days. <br /> <br />The album is made up of high-BPM, high-concept dance tracks, slowing only ever-so-slightly near the end for the RnB-tinged \\"Push\\" which will hopefully get a release or a remix somewhere down the road. <br /> <br />The album showcases some of the best production she has ever done and some very clever lyrics. Stuart Price, musical director of her Re-Invention Tour, but best known for producing and remixing this years dance sensation Juliet, along with his numerous dance remixes of artists like No Doubt, Killers, FischerSpooner and his very own remix of Madonna's \\"Hollywood,\\" co-produced eleven of the tracks on this album with Madonna. The man is absolutely brilliant and truly brought out the best material Madonna has recorded in ages. <br /> <br />The most notable downfall of this album is that it is continuous. Each song mixes into each other, and that really is a downside for those, like me, who prefer to listen to albums on shuffle. Here's hoping there is an eventual release with all the songs separated. And take note that the limited edition, featuring one extra song entitled \\"Fighting Spirit,\\" will be in stores on December 13th, just in time for Christmas. <br /> <br />Believe me, just for that one song, I will be first in line. <br />
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This show just started here in the UK on daytime television on ITV1.I managed to catch a handful of episodes whilst on holiday recently and all I can say is that, as ITV1 currently has a prime time schedule stuffed with so called \\"celebrity\\"shows and soaps, it is shameful that this beautiful series is being squandered in day time. <br /> <br />Still, there are also ITV2, 3 and 4 for digital TV viewers so maybe one of those will be able to run the show in prime time which is what this show so richly deserves. <br /> <br />This for me is perfect dramatic television, a series with believable characters and, most importantly with real heart.Treat Williams is outstanding as troubled Dr Andrew Brown and indeed the whole cast and everything about the show is excellent, but if I had to single out one person on screen for particular praise, it would have to be the marvellous Gregory Smith whose performance as Ephram is jaw-droppingly excellent in my view. <br /> <br />Another winner from the WB which seems to have developed a happy knack of delivering quality product such as \\"Charmed\\", \\"Smallville\\", \\"Seventh Heaven\\" and now \\"Everwood\\". <br /> <br />I hope that soon we will be able see seasons 2-4 on TV over here and indeed on DVD <br /> <br />

6305364648|5.0|The plot is covered in so many of these reviews I won't go there.  I will concur with repeated comment that these are Arnold's and Tom's best performances to date.  Jamie Lee Curtis is great too (and if you agree check her out in \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\"), as is Bill Paxton doing another outstanding, funny, loudmouth coward (as he did in \\"Aliens\\").  No performance in this film disappoints. <br />As a product package, this DVD is lacking in the Special Features department -- nothing but the trailer?  Come on!  I bought this on VHS and then on DVD and I would gladly buy it again with the kind of Special Features that James Cameron's other projects get -- I'm thinking here of \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Dark Angel.\\"  I would of course expect to pay more than for this bare bones disc, which is worth having until the deluxe package comes out. <br />Trivia: in Robert Rodriguez' \\"Once Upon A Time in Mexico\\" Johnny Depp says \\"This is no time to screw the pooch\\" and Robert says in the Special Features that it was one of Johnny's many ad libs, and that he (Robert) had never heard the phrase before.  This movie is where I first heard it, used in precisely the same way, if not the same tense (past as opposed to present) by Double-O Arnold's boss.  Don't know if it's spy speak or movie speak. <br />Last note: I disagree that this movie doesn't treat women with respect.  Lot's of men lie to their wives for less acceptable reasons than this one, and Jamie's character holds her own even before she finds out what's really going on.  This couple is really in love, after over a decade of marriage, and they work out their personal problems AND save (most of) the country.  <br />It's worth checking out, even if this isn't usually your kind of movie.

B0000C9JFO|3.0|Charm and insight aren't always a match in movies, but here they are. We can overlook the flaws --- an awful credits sequence, fast-forward editing, agitated dissolves --- because, well, just try to resist its big surprise: it illuminates the values of the young people who soon will be running our world. A coed group of students from different countries share an apartment in Barcelona where they come of age and hit the books (learning a few hard lessons not in them.) That's a large order which the young cast accomplishes admirably.    We meet them through a French kid (Romain Duris) enrolled to soak up Spanish culture in order to land a corporate job, much to the dismay of his girlfriend in Paris (Audrey Tatou). He shares a bedroom with a lesbian who teaches him how to seduce the wife of a neurologist. The brother (Kevin Bishop in a nifty performance) of another roommate shows up unexpectedly and saves his sister's reputation. Out of the chaos and camaraderie of their salad days emerges a reality-based hope for the future. Barcelona, by the way, looks just as attractive as the cast.

0060234814|4.0|Jeffrey Shanghai                                   <br /> <br />A fascinating book...  <br /> <br />The book I chose to read for this assignment is \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\", and the reason I chose it was because I have already read it's previous book in the series (The Magician's Nephew), therefore I chose to carry on with the series, as I find reading sequels one after another is a lot easier than reading independent books that I have no connection of. The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel.   This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up.  And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present.  <br />
B00001IVOR|4.0|This is my Graduation disc because it seems like it came out around the same time I graduated I like this Cd pretty good not as good as 36 chambers but a good follow up great lyrics pretty good beats
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Unlike others who review a CD without even listening to it, I always get to know the stuff before giving my opinion. Well, I bought it and liked every song of the album. I don't care about reviews, as long as I like the record. That's what matters most.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|\\"Hypnotize,\\" the second half of System of a Down's 2005 opus, is clearly a continuation of their first album, \\"Mezmerize\\" (which was released earlier in 2005). In addition to not being very far removed musically from \\"Mezmerize,\\" this album also follows about the same blueprint. The songs on \\"Hypnotize\\" are very corky and energetic. It combines jokes with serious, bold political messages, and heavy songs (\\"Stealing Society\\") with slower, ballad-esque numbers (\\"Lonely Day\\"). Plus, many of the songs have several tempo changes. (\\"Dreaming\\" combines \\"Chop Suey\\"-esque singing with tempo changes that bring \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" to mind, and \\"U-Fig\\" and \\"Holy Mountains\\" are chaotic, off-the-wall tunes with whiplash speed changes and even acoustic guitar breakdowns.) And, finally, guitarist/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than he did on the band's first two albums. But most of his singing, here, is actually pretty good. (Track one, \\"Attack\\" begins with fast, ultra-crunchy riffs, before Daron begins to croon nasally, and he actually sounds as good as Serj.)<br /><br />There are a few throw away tracks on here. \\"She's Like Heroin\\" goes absolutely no where, and \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" is so silly, it could be a \\"Steal This Album\\" b-side. But there are several more good songs than so-so's, and there are a few mature moments (i.e. \\"Kill Rock `N Roll\\" and the title track), which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song.<br /><br />Upon my first listening to this album, I was not at all impressed. I thought System were trying to hard to be funny, but usually ended up coming across as goofy. Fortunately, however, I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot. So I recommend you do the same; buy it, and give it time to sink under your skin (something it will most definitely do). It isn't a great C.D., but it's still quite good, and worth buying if you're a fairly big SOAD fan; if you're a casual fan, however, you could probably just be satisfied with any one of System's five records.with any one of System's five records.
B000069AUI|5.0|Great!!! I was really surprised at how much I liked this, because normally I thought of Coldplay as being too mellow and too quiet for my tastes, but this album blew me away. Not only can they be loud at times, but the lyrics are very thoughtfull and heartfelt. <br /> The first track was pretty fast paced (for Coldplay), and I was worried that the rest of the album would sink back into the band's usual moodiness. But it kept the momentum going with the third track(which has a great beat)then to \\"Clocks\\", which is probably one of my favorite Coldplay songs. I also enjoyed \\"Warning Sign\\", but all of the songs have something cool about them. This is great for a long car trip, and is one of the few albums that I don't mind letting run through the whole way, because normally I like to skip around the CD. So check it out! You should also look into their first album, Parachutes, which has some good tracks on it.

B000002JOH|1.0|By one of the worst bands on the planet. <br /> <br />I simpley can't see why everyone goes so crazy for this overrated and utterly pedestrian band? Maybe there is something i'm missing, but i just don't see how this \\"agro\\" rock (i'm not calling this metal, that would be an insult to the gendre) band has managed to get a record deal and actually put out albums full of \\"noise\\". Do these idiot fans even realize that the whole \\"Angry-tough violent man, don't screw with us\\" attitude that this band displays is a total contradiction? Go back just a few years before their popularity in the 90's and they were a pretty-boy glam band that played songs about girls, fast cars and break-ups. Pretty big change in attitude, don't you think? Thats like the closet gay who goes to parties and pretends to be into women to prove his manliness to his chums. My only guess is that they changed their sound and image because the record company told them too, hair metal was no longer marketable and this new \\"Angry-depression-angst rock\\" was the next big thing. It would be a mistake to actualy think these guys were tough or \\"Hard-Core\\", they simpley act this way for the almighty dollar. I'm sure if the lable told them to dress in balerina suits and play music about kittie cats, rainbows and loli-pops, they would of done it. <br /> <br />\\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is probably the bands best effort, i must say that is sad because if this is their best, i shudder to think how bad Pantera's worst could be. Songs like \\"Mouth for War\\", \\"F**king Hostile\\" and \\"Walk\\" will lower your IQ about 20 points just listening to them. And another thing i can't belive is how all of you morons are crying over Dimebag, the guy was one of the most overrated guitarists ever. I know i'm gonna have some guy try to ripp me apart with a review plauged with naughty words and bad grammar, but i don't care, thats not gonna stop me from warning other to please stay away from this tripe and spend you hard-earned cash elsewhere. These guys don't deserve a penny.   <br /> <br />Why does such mediocore tripe like this get praised and lauded like no tomorrow? I better not say anything else though, or i might get beat-up by a big, bad, angry Pantera fan. Whats that Pantera fan? gonna bust my skull open just because i dissed you moronic music? guess you will have to find me first, loser.
0375760067|5.0|I can understand the polarity of opinion about this book. And you certainly don't want to be reading Thomas Hardy while listening to Leonard Cohen. Don't dismiss the negative comments out of hand - Hardy is probably not for all tastes.<br /><br />In my case though, as a student disinterested in reading, this novel turned me into a reader. It has a \\"heavy\\" style, but I think it was this depth that appealed to me most - that, and the obvious devotion Hardy felt toward his beloved Wessex (strange how this passion of the author for his countryside seems to me more forcefully written than most other stories where passion is thematic). Of course I have since read all the Wessex novels but this remains my favorite, and probably my favorite novel of all.<br /><br />Still, not an easy recommendation.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This album is right up my alley.  I'm not going to write a detailed review so preview it and turn up the volume...either you like it or you don't.
B00008NRL8|5.0|I came to this CD through Bajofondo Tango Club (by the way, if you haven't bought it yet, do so ASAP), hoping to find the same dance-ish type of tango. <br />I have to agree with another reviewer - Bajofondo's dance-ish patterns and sounds are nowhere on this CD - but nonetheless, it's a cool and energizing compilation of 'modern' tango tunes. Definitely enjoyable, even if you're a techno/electro/freak like me.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|\\"Celtic Woman\\" features four gifted Irish sopranos known by first names only (Lisa, Chloe, Meav, and Orla) who cover some of the most beautiful Celtic and New Age tunes ever recorded: the rollicking Si Do Mhaimeo I, (previously recorded by Altan), She Moved Through The Fair, Siuil A Run, Danny Boy, Isle of Innisfree, Brian Kennedy and Secret Garden's (and later, Josh Groban, Sissel and Selah) You Raise Me Up, Enya's Orinoco Flow and May It Be, Sarah Brightman's Nella Fantasia (recently covered by Amici Forever and Il Divo), based on Ennio Morricone's score to \\"The Mission\\", Clannad's haunting titles to Harry's Game, and several other tracks (Someday from Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Butterfly based on The Secret of Roan Inish's score, Send Me A Song, The Soft Goodbye).<br /><br />This is Celtic-influenced New Age at its most soothing, comparable to Enya in the filtered, ethereal vocals and lush orchestral backing of strings and harp. Several songs featured layered vocals to stunning effect, such as Danny Boy, Harry's Game, and Siuil A Run. The tracks flow smoothly into each other, allowing for an hour of beautiful melodies that uplift and calm. There is also a DVD (ASIN: B0007M22TI) that features the girls singing twenty-one songs live in concert, along with bonus interviews.<br /><br />I own a large library of Irish and New Age, and the covers on Celtic Woman surpass some of the original versions. This is a wonderful gift of tranquility, of finding a quiet moment in a too-hectic world, that allows the listener to relax and reconnect. Fans of Enya, Clannad, Celtic and classical crossover should definitely check out \\"Celtic Woman.\\"
B0007XT87G|5.0|They renew themselves from album to album. They have now the tendency to go heavier and heavier without leaving the fans behind.  <br /> <br />Listen to \\"Arriving somewhere but not here\\" and you'll know what I mean. 12 minutes of beauty from start to end. You'll go in a multitude of rock genres, begins in space-rock, switch to accoustic, to hardrock,there is a big metal mid-section that has an ambient section entwine in it. This song ends with a frenetic piano.  <br /> <br />\\"The start of something beautiful\\" even the title says it! Here the recipe: Put some angelical sounds, add on some freaky bass, stir it with an intelligent drum movement, pour here and there furious vocoder lyrics bring to boil with heavier sounds. Reduce the heat and it will be tender (the guitar is really tender at 6:07 minutes). Eat it up and digest cheer!  <br /> <br />\\"Deadwing\\" is something else, a repeated strange mix of heaviness and psychadelia with an awsome minimalist ambient mid-section that becomes a mega guitar mania (nicely done).  <br /> <br />I have to admit that Lazarus is the boring one, it should have been the last song on the disc. <br />
0375713751|5.0|I'm amazed at the negative reviews of this book. I am a working mother of three kids and I see the competitiveness in parents all the time that Alison Pearson so expertly picks up on. In addition, I'm reliably informed that the email affair is based upon a real event between executives at a top financial institution (I won't name it!). I'm a copywriter myself and found it to be superbly crafted so I'm at a loss as to what one reviewer found lacking in the character beyond chapter one. I would thoroughly recommend this book to any mother with a braincell who has a school age child. Even my childless, single, nearly-50 year old best friend found the book compelling because she could 'see' so many people she knew as she read it. Don't buy the negativity; it's a fabulous romp and the only way you'll find it depressing is if you can't laugh at yourself.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|My favorite Biggie album by far. Less commercial than Life After Death, and containing no filler whatsoever in my opinion, this album is above and beyond what many rappers today can even dream of doing. (Not to knock any modern rappers, but I'm not into a few of the current artists who seem to be selling so well).  <br /> <br />My favorite songs off this album have to be Gimme that Loot, Big Poppa, and of course, Juicy, one of the most well known rap songs ever, even sampled as half of the first song on Jay-Z's Blueprint 2. Even if you aren't a rap/hip-hop fan and have no idea about ANYTHING regarding rap, chances are you've heard at least one of these songs without even realizing it. <br /> <br />This album is just classic. Biggie Smalls is the Billy Joel of rap. His untimely death was a shame, as I'm sure he would have had a lot more to offer to fans of rap, and even casual listeners of the genre.

B000069CWE|5.0|This is one of the great bands that can blend rock and rap.  I've loved ReAnimation since I bought it in July 2002.  Its a great blend of guest appearances from the right underrated, understated, and underground rappers blended with the underrated production from understated producers.  Frgt/10 ft Charlie 2NA produced by The Alchemist is off da hook!  The Alchemist is the in-house producer who made a lot of Mobb Deep's latest and greatest songs.  Charli 2NA deep and annunciation(sp) is right on point.  Enth E Nd with Kustmasta Kurt and Motion Man is another great song.  I actually think this song is just if not better than the original.  I probably play this song the most.  Plc.4 Mie Haed (Amp Live ft. Zion) is awesome.   <br /> <br />I was really impressed and still am that this album was so well put together. It deserves to be played skip-free.
0525948023|5.0|If you got the concepts in the Power of Now, and love the simple, easy-to-understand message of that book, you will find a \\"going deeper\\" happening with this one.<br /><br />I've always been one to disagree with spiritual teachers about the ego - that it's basically all bad. If it's bad, why did God create it? My feeling is if it is here on Earth, it belongs, even though we may not understand why.<br /><br />That said, Eckhart clearly defines, with excellent examples, how our identification with the ego (and not the ego itself, mind you) keeps us from simply being in the present and instead tied to thoughts, concepts, mind-stuff, endless identification with people, places, and things. He shows us the many forms and faces that the ego takes up, and shows us the fallacy of identifying with forms in the first place.<br /><br />To identify so completely with form is to identify with that which is doomed to extinction, causing us loss and sadness. Wouldn't it be better if we simply observed things from an aware state, and not get so caught up in them? This is Eckhart's goal, to get us to a place where we can see the benefits of raising our awareness, and actually wanting to do so.<br /><br />Ah, easier said than done, I hear you say. Within the pages of A New Earth, Eckhart gives us precisely the tools we need to recognize and become aware of own folly. From that higher state of awareness, the flowers of enlightenment can bloom. And voila, a New Earth is born.<br /><br />I find this book a great comfort.
B000089RVX|5.0|I heard a number of these songs over 2 years ago.  I'm usually very late whene finally listening to albums.  For example, it took me 5 years to finally sit down and listen to Outkast's \\"Aquemini\\" album.     I listened to that album non-stop for about 6 months back in Nov 2002.  Back to Evanescence. I finally sat myself down tonight and downloaded \\"My Immortal\\" which I enjoyed listening to previously along with their other obvious hits.  My Immortal stuck out like a thumb when I started to listening to it again about 20 mins ago.  Like one of the previous reviewers stated, it made me pull over and made you tear up...even though I'm at home listening to it through my earphones on my computer.  I totally zoned out when Amy Lee pours heart out on this song.  Lets get one thing straight, I'm a straight black guy with a girlfriend. I'm into all kinds of music.  Raised on hip-hop/r&b.  Always enjoyed rock.  My main bands I like are 311, Linkin Park, Modest Mouse, Franz Ferdinand, Coldplay, Citizen Cope, Portishead, Gorillaz, N*E*R*D.  So, it wasn't a far fetch to me to listen to Evanscence.  Back to my My Immortal.  This songs drowns out everything around you.  I actually sat there at the computer and did not think of anything while listening to the song.  I could think about was Amy Lee's inviting and soul-touching voice.  I thought to myself, \\"damn, why haven't I listened to this record before?\\"  I actually began to tear up as she sang on.  I didn't break down crying, but when I song is so deep and well thought out and has a tremendous vocalist bellowing out notes like Amy Lee, I couldn't help get a lil verklempt. All in all, this song will definately stay in rotation for years to come.

B0000549B0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Jimmy Stewart; I don't think I've seen one of his movies that I haven't liked. It's A Wonderful Life is probably my all-time favorite movie. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is up there in my top 10. Even Shenandoah, which has its ridiculous moments, is a great movie.  I saw a staged version of Harvey over the weekend. The play, written by Mary Chase, was written before the movie. There are a lot of similarities, and all of the best moments in the film are also in the stage version. This cast did a good job of walking in Jimmy Stewart's huge shadow, and I was reminded by the end of the play how very much I enjoy this story and the character of Elwood P. Dowd. Elwood, played by Stewart in the film, is the most gentle and friendly person anyone would ever want to meet. Everyone likes him, until they get to know him. Then he introduces his friend Harvey, a 6-foot tall invisible rabbit. Harvey is a pooka, a mythological prankster that has revealed himself to Elwood and nobody else. The plot, which is basically silly, never gets in the way of the characters. The story is sweet and funny and old-fashioned. In some ways, Harvey is a precursor to a movie like Donnie Darko. In other ways, it's unlike anything else. When I watch Harvey, I think about how cynical I can be, and how much happier I might be if I could just shrug off my sarcasm and be more like Elwood P. Dowd. If you've never seen the film, definitely check it out.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This CD is a work of genius. True fans will love it even more after several listenings, because Pat Metheny's music always has multi layers and this CD is no different. The finesse of the melodies and the strength of the rhythms are at such a level of superiority that very few musicians could ever reach it.  I would venture to say that Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra or Frank Zappa would have only been able to achieve such Greatness (if they were still with us today).  Having known Pat Metheny's music since his beginning in the mid-seventies, his music has evolved and matured like a Chteauneuf du Pape (Ctes du Rhne red wine)....
B00005JOHI|4.0|When I heard that there was a new version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" to be made, I was far from pleased. In fact, I was fairly annoyed: A&E's version with Colin Firth has been a staple of my DVD collection for an incredibly long time, and I couldn't imagine anyone tampering with perfection. Why mess with genius?<br /><br />Happily, I was wrong in my estimation of the movie. Perhaps it's only appropriate, given the subject matter: the whole story of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is wrapped up in wrong estimations of character, miscommunications, and partial understandings. The Focus Features version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is more of a classic Romance, set earlier in period and filmed against more stunning backdrops than the A&E version: there were no grand cliffs or windswept heaths in that one, but they work here.<br /><br />The performances are universally excellent: I was appropriately annoyed by Brenda Blethyn's ludicrously inappropriate Mrs. Bennet, and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine de Bourgh is one of the most delicious strokes of casting genius...ever. Donald Sutherland as the bemused patriarch Mr. Bennet holds his own in a largely British cast, and was suitably affectionately distracted in his fatherly role. Simon Woods is amiable and open-faced as Mr. Bingley, and properly deserves Rosamund Pike's delicate Jane.<br /><br />The movie belongs, however, to Matthew McFadyen and Keira Knightley, as it rightly should. The book, however involved its subplots, focused mainly on their sparring, and the film wisely excises a lot of the extraneous matter, tightening its focus and condensing some scenes. Matthew McFadyen is, possibly, an even better Mr. Darcy than Colin Firth (though that pains me to say): his Darcy is sensitive, prone to moodiness and shows of the Stiff Upper Lip, but his eyes don't always manage to keep up the mask, and it is this that makes him amazing. When his eyes do light up, it is stunning, because we have learned not to expect it. He positively smolders with passion, even soaking wet with pleading in his eyes. Or perhaps especially soaking wet. In any case, he smolders. Bosoms will heave, corsets or not, when he's onscreen.<br /><br />Watching Keira Knightley as Lizzie Bennet I was irresistibly reminded of another fiercely intelligent, wide-eyed brunette bookworm: Winona Ryder's Jo March, in 1994's exquisite \\"Little Women.\\" Knightley conveys the same compelling blend of delicacy and strength as Ryder managed, no easy feat in this world of one-note romance, and one I wasn't sure she could manage, as I've never been a fan. Knightley does a good job, however: her Lizzie is a \\"fearsome creature,\\" to quote herself, both fiercely loyal and heartily passionate for life, yet always with just a trace of vulnerability; one wonders, at times, if her passionate demeanour isn't as much a disguise as Darcy's cool mask. Perhaps that is what makes their inevitable but much-delayed romance so alluring: here are two people who absolutely should be in love with each other, but manage to think themselves out of it for a very long time.<br /><br />The world of the film is more realistically rural than other adaptations: the ladies' hems are dirty, their dresses are frequently wrinkled, and pigs traipse through the Bennet house as often as visitors do. There are some lovely little touches to the filmmaking as well, such as one scene featuring a distracted Mr. Darcy being circled, predator-like, by Lizzie and the coolly condescending Caroline Bingley; one absolutely feels sorry for the man. I particularly liked the dancing scenes: there is always something going on with someone familiar in the corner of the frame, lending the scenes a pleasant intimacy that suits the material nicely.<br /><br />Ultimately, I love this story so much because its romantic heroes deserve one another, even though they do not always realize it. Theirs is a relationship built not only on passion - although in this version, even more so than the seminal A&E version, it is decidedly present, particularly in a post-wedding scene at Pemberley featuring (sigh!) a barefoot Mr. Darcy - but on mutual interests and a hearty respect for one another. When Lizzie and Darcy finally marry (as we know they must, long before they do) it is, to steal from Shakespeare (and another Jane Austen movie) a \\"marriage of true minds.\\" And after all, what could be more romantic than a smart, handsome man in a cravat and a long, windblown coat?a post-wedding scene at Pemberley featuring (sigh!) a barefoot Mr. Darcy - but on mutual interests and a hearty respect for one another.

B00005JOHI|5.0|Some considerable time ago, I watched the BBC miniseries presentation of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, a chick-flick if there ever was one starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, at the urging of a Jane Austen-obsessed female friend. When I reluctantly admitted that I thoroughly enjoyed it, I realized that I must resign my long-standing membership in the Neanderthal Male Fellowship. Now, much to my horror and apparently diminished masculinity, I have to say that this 2005 version of P & P was even more captivating and better than the BBC version in all respects, albeit much shorter in length.<br /><br />The plot of P & P needs no extensive recapitulation here; if you don't know it by now after many cinematic renderings, then forget it. Briefly, the story surrounds five unwed daughters of a son-less English country gentleman, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland), in financial decline in the early 19th century (or, as in this new version, the late 18th). The girls, particularly the eldest Jane (Rosamund Pike), the second eldest, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), and the third eldest, Lydia (Jena Malone), get caught up in a romantic tangle with a plethora of would-be suitors: the perky young gentleman Charles Bingley (Simon Woods), the darkly moody young nobleman Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), the dashing Army officer Lt. Wickham (Rupert Friend), and the weasley cleric cousin William Collins (Tom Hollander). The girls' fear of impending spinsterhood is whipped into a froth by the maternal anxieties of their foolish and marriage-obsessed mother (Brenda Blethyn). Mr. Bennet accepts his fate as the sole male in this estrogen-driven household with a certain bemused resignation. In any case, the focus of the story is on Elizabeth (\\"Lizzie\\") and Darcy, whom the former initially despises as arrogant and boorish. It's Darcy's pride and Lizzie's prejudice that must come to terms in this comic opera of social customs and manners.<br /><br />This version of P & P has been criticized by purists for at least two reasons, both of which are irrelevant to me since I haven't read, nor do I intend to read, the original Austen novel. First, the financial health of the Bennet clan is, apparently, reduced from that in the book (and, indeed, from that in the BBC miniseries). Indeed, while the family still employs servants and seems to have enough food on the table, their lifestyle here is noticeably more seedy - almost grubby - than previously depicted. Well, why not? It's this desperate condition caused by an aging patriarch and lack of a male heir that has Mom and her brood worked into a frenzy about their future prospects. Indeed, cousin William, due to inherit the estate on Mr. Bennet's death, is already nosing around inspecting the goods. Second, fault has been found with Macfadyen's Darcy as less obstinate, i.e. self-assured, in his pride than Firth's version. Now, while I readily admit that Firth's Darcy is perhaps his career's best role, I find Colin generally to be a Lump in all his screen roles. Matthew's version displays an anguished vulnerability beneath the proud veneer that's tapped by his attraction to Keira's Lizzie. And what man in his right mind wouldn't be? Keira's version is a Bewitching Babe with two capital Bs. (All through the screening, I strained to remember where I'd seen Macfadyen before; he's not exactly a familiar face on American Big Screens. Afterwards, I remembered that he plays the lead in the current British telly miniseries \\"MI5\\".)<br /><br />This P & P, as befitting a major production, has cinematography that is, at times, positively luminous, and the camera work is more adroit and clever than anything seen previous. Three scenes were, for me, particularly memorable: the visual isolation of Lizzie and Darcy from the rest of the revelers at The Ball, Lizzie's changing view of the Bennet estate as she spins in a swing hung under an arch, and Mrs. Bennet's inclusion, white petticoats flying, in a flock of scurrying white, silly geese as she pursues a rebellious daughter across the yard. These visuals were positively inspired.<br /><br />There are no acting performances here anything less than superb. Special mention must be given to Judi Dench as the imperious Lady Catherine, Sutherland as the overwhelmed, gentle Mr. Bennet, and Hollander's brilliant rendition of the pathetic Collins.<br /><br />Yes, I like this PRIDE AND PREJUDICE more than I can adequately explain. It may, perhaps, land a place on my Ten Most Favorite Films list.she pursues a rebellious daughter across the yard.

B00005JO1P|5.0|\\"Walk the line\\" is one of the few films that had a lot of hype surrounding it that managed to surpass my expectations.  Upon first hearing that there was a Johnny Cash biopic film starring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, I didn't really think much of it.  I thought they're just trying to \\"cash\\" in on the popularity of \\"Ray\\" from last year.  And the actors!  I couldn't really picture Phoenix and Witherspoon doing justice to Johnny and June.  While both are fine actors it really takes a special talent and can be really risky portraying country music legends such as Cash and Carter.  Then, I heard that \\"Walk the line\\" got good reviews from a number of critics.  And, my friends who saw it also spoke very highly of it.  After seeing it yesterday, I consider it the best movie of the year and worthy of oscar nominations.   <br /> <br />The story focuses mainly on Johnny and June Carter.  There are alot of similarities in this film with \\"Ray\\", but the main difference is that the complexity of his relationship with June is shown more here as a saving grace than Ray's wife was.  The director allows this focus to give insight to how songs were written by both Cash and Carter.  It's interesting after hearing Cash and Carter's songs for so long to finally see the circumstances surrounding their lives which inspired them.    <br /> <br />Phoenix and Witherspoon both give the performance of their careers.  Both their voices are amazingly accurate to the originals.  With Phoenix managing to hit all the right notes with a suprisingly almost perfect timbre, while Witherspoon sings well and even with a Carter-ish growl.  The chemistry these two posess between eachother makes it easy for the audience to believe Johnny's love for June as well as June's reluctance to marry Johnny for so many years.  Both deserve a nomination for best actor and actress, since they both nail their respective parts.  Out of the two, I think Phoenix is more likely to win an oscar because his portrayalof Johnny is so beleivable.  Johnny's vulnerability and wild side are portrayed with ease by Phoenix.  Phoenix has a talent for giving deep, probing characters with an emotional side and he not only does that but he seems to channel Cash through him and never once does the audience look at him and not think he is Cash.  Kudos to the rest of the cast but Witherspoon and Phoenix really make the film as well as the writers and director James Mangold.   <br /> <br />\\"Walk the line\\" is touching, powerful, and highly recommended!
B000AYQLX6|5.0|This superb re-issue of John Lennon's WALLS AND BRIDGES does indeed have a booklet; a 12-page booklet, in fact, which reproduces the entire booklet issued in 1974 with the original 12-inch LP and adds a picture. (One picture from the photo session in the original insert has been replaced with a similar one from the same session, but this is not a drastic change.) Lennon's original list of musicians is intact, so it includes such humorous psuedonyms for himself as Mel Torment and the Rev. Thumbs Ghurkin. The booklet reproduces the full-page history of the name Lennon from the original insert, with Lennon's snappy hand-written response to the claim that no one with his name ever achieved anything: \\"Oh, yeh?\\" So, attention to Lennon's original has been paid. The lift-the-flap cover isn't there anymore, but, the pictures which were part of it are there, so, I say this packaging is a pretty good tribute to the original. The LP, when first released in 1975, had pristine sound, which had not been the case with Lennon's previous album, MIND GAMES, which had muddy sound. (MIND GAMES has been re-mastered recently and sounds much clearer than it used to sound.) So, this new CD of WALLS AND BRIDGES is not a drastic change from the original LP, because the LP was crystal clear. What has been done here is a restoration to the original sound. The first CD issue of WALLS AND BRIDGES didn't sound nearly as clear as the vinyl but the new release does sound like the vinyl and that's great. Some of the tracks have been merely re-mixed, but some have been re-mastered. I think this means that the restoration team did not want to change anything too much and that they were careful to re-master only when necessary. <br />By the way, I paid $18.99 at an independent record shop, so I don't see this as in anyway overpriced. I imagine the big record outlets will sell it for a few dollars less.  <br />The three bonus tracks are perfect for this CD. One is the live version of \\"Whatever Gets YouThrough The Night\\" which Elton John and John Lennon played at Madison Square Garden, one is a demo of \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\" featuring Lennon's voice and his accoustic guitar and the third is a brief but interesting promotional interview Lennon recorded for EMI records when this album was first released. It is the last track on the CD so the interview does not interrupt the music. <br />Lennon is in command here. If the horns are a bit heavy, they do match the somber mood of this intelligent work from a man who was spending too many nights at after hours bars and knew it. Jesse Ed Davis's curvaceous guitar sound is vital to WALLS AND BRIDGES.  If you think of \\"#9 Dream\\" and love the opening guitar, thank Jesse Ed Davis. <br />This is Lennon the craftsman. He once described \\"#9 Dream\\" as a \\"written\\" song, adding that he hadn't invested any emotion in it. Perhaps what I admire about this album is its lack of overt emotion. Lennon's understated performance here is what makes it great.   <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Dear Madonna, <br /> <br />As most of your devoted fans, I eagerly awaited the arrival of your new album, Confessions on A Dance Floor.  However, it seems that all of my eager anticipation and high hopes were truly in vain.  I can't say I hated the new material.  I will always have some affinity for the work you do, because after all...you are Madonna! <br /> <br />That being said, after have my initial listen to the new album, I was a little more than nonplussed by what I heard.  If this had been an album by one of your wannabe progeny like Britney or Christina, or even one of your inferior contemporaries like Kylie, I would have been more impressed.  After all, these gals don't write and produce their own material (at least not with any grand success).  And they are hardly self-invented the way you are.  No matter how hard they try, they will not ever be Madonna! <br /> <br />As a long time fan (since the beginning-honestly) I have had a truly rare bird's-eye view of your career through your inceptions, your sudden rise to meteoric fame, your transition into goddess (forget diva) status, and beyond.  I could see what you were doing and what you aught to be doing, sometimes before you yourself could see it.  I could have told you that you should have been collaborating with Shep Pettibone and William Orbit long before you actually decided to do it.  Perhaps most of your fans don't truly recognize your patterns-actions and reactions to your previous works and their successes and missteps (I dislike the word \\"failures\\")-quite the way I might. <br /> <br />Music was the first disc in a while that seems far less self conscious and much more focused on just good `ol dance music.  You were still forging new territory by tingeing the sound with a little retro 80s.  The title track is still one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Then came American Life.  OK, so I realize things in the States were (and still are) truly screwed up politically and other wise, but we needed you tobe the one who brought us some much needed escapism.  Leave the political rants to Bono.  And the further self examination of your fame and the loss of your mother was becoming too much for any of us to bear.   The post 9-11 world truly changed all of our priorities, and celebrities whining about their own pain and frustration meant little.  We were too wrapped up in our own.  But the true breaking point too this album was the incessant droning on of electronically modulated voices.  This was beyond my comprehension.  You were definitely repeating yourself.   <br /> <br />So that brings us to Confessions on a Dance Floor.  I'm still not sure were to begin with this one... <br /> <br />I'll start with the more obvious, albeit rare highpoints.  Sorry, Future Lovers, Jump, How High, Push, and Like It or Not are definitely the most inspired bits.  The rest of it is largely forgettable and almost pointless.  I strain to hear what, beyond your voice, you contributed to these songs.  They are lack-luster and ordinary.  Stewart Price, while probably a great tour conductor, is no Patrick Leonard.  I was glad to see Mirwais was very minimal in his contributions at this time, I was left wanting more contributions from Bloodshy & Avant.  The most richly textured song was Like it or Not, both lyrically and sonically.  Why these guys weren't found in greater quantities I'll never know. <br /> <br />But more importantly, I'm left wondering why there weren't more collaborations with both seasoned veterans and the pick of the new crop of talent out there today.  Madonna, you could work with anyone you wanted to!! Clearly Pat Leonard has been one of your most prolific song writing and producing partners.  Bringing him back for Ray of Light was genius and the paring of his classically trained ear with the nouveau electronic wizardry of William Orbit created some of the most lavishly produced stuff you've ever made (i.e. Frozen). Shep was also a good partner for you.  He's never received another chance.  What about Nelly Hooper?  Bedtime Story was a sonic revelation.  And then there are a host of others you've not tried like BT (Brian Transeau), Tracy Young, Calderone, and many others who have remixed your songs.  The way you love to modulate your voice, I would think that the paring of you and BT would thrill you to death.  <br /> <br />All I can figure is that you were disappointed about the lack of attention that American Life got.  It was full of innovation, but it lacked hooks.  Mirwais is an awesome talent, no doubt, but why not water him down a bit with other co-song writers and producers?  It would still work. Perhaps this scared you into playing it safe.  Well, it was too safe this time and largely uninspiring.  You're Madonna.  You don't have to play it safe any more.  <br /> <br />Don't worry, I still love you and always will.  You've gone on in ways that most of your class of the 1980s never could.  Prince, Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Paula Abdul will never get this chance.  Anytime they try to make a new album it will be considered a come back.  You never left us, and for that I am truly grateful. <br /> <br />I'm already looking forward to your next effort.  M should always stand for Madonna, not mediocre.  <br /> <br />Yours always, <br /> <br />A rabid fan!
B000068PQ0|4.0|Yep, it's pretty weird. And that's coming from someone who regularly listens to experimental jazz and Japanese noise... Well, I guess I should say it's weird in a different way to what you might expect.    \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\" is definitely one of the 'poppiest' albums I've purchased in a long while. It's full of beautiful songs with oddly triumphant (but at the same time often heart-breaking) lyrics. But throughout, as with most Flaming Lips stuff, there are dark, experimental layers which you could very well miss on a casual listen. For example electronic rumblings or crazy guitar feedback could be bubbling in the background, but your focus is generally on the pop gem in the foreground... or is it?     Anyway, then get this - tracks like \\"One More Robot\\" and \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt.1\\" feature big funky beats that wouldn't be out of place on a hip/trip-hop album (are they doing this because they don't know any better, are they trying to be 'funny', or is it all fully intentional? It doesn't really matter, because somehow it just *works*). I've heard nearly every style blended with every other style, but here it just seems 'so wrong it's right' - even if it's all absolutely deliberate it still has a certain naivety which is touching and refreshing. It's kind of like Radiohead without the self-consciousness (but don't get me wrong, I do like Radiohead).    Most reviews mention the 'hits' \\"Yoshimi..\\" and \\"Do You Realize??\\", and these are indeed great tunes. My album highlights though are \\"In The Morning Of The Magicians\\" with it's floating off-beat verse and funny little snippets of 'chamber-midi', and the deranged choral love song \\"Are You A Hypnotist??\\".    My only complaint with this album is the opening track. As was noted when it was released as a single, \\"Fight Test\\" sounds very much like Cat Stevens' \\"Father And Son\\" and The Flaming Lips faced a bit of trouble and I believe they ended up having to pay Stevens royalties. Let's face it, \\"Fight Test\\" isn't a great song anyway, and definitely not worth the trouble. Usually I look to the first track of an album for a 'big bang' and something that represents the album, but here I just have to skip it every time I listen unfortunately.     But not wanting to end on a sour note, I will say that the other 10 tracks are brilliant. Highly recommended! (4.5 out of 5)
B0000524CY|4.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Well, this is the extended version of the Exorcist and having seen this and the theatrical version I have to recommend going with this one. Though it only has ten mintues of extra footage, the additional scenes are worth it. The movie starts off slow as does the prequel(s) before it but it is not long before it picks up. The effects used for this movie were intense and even a bit frightning at some points and for a movie made during the 70's (before Star Wars anyway) this was probably rare. After having seen Exorcist Beginning, the opening seqeunce for this movie makes sense as does the piece of the demon statue along with the connection between the demon and Father Merrin though you don't see Merrin until the last third of the movie. I strongly recommend seeing Exorcist Beginning before watching this. As for the dvd, it lacks bonus features unlike the special edition dvd. However, the special edition dvd does not give you the option of viewing the extended version though the features on it are nice. I suppose a true exorcist fan would have both though I prefer the extra footage over the bonus features. If you find films about demonic possession entertaining, the Exorcist is recommended.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird was first published in 1960 and it went on to win the prestigious Pulitzer Prize. Sadly Harper Lee has had no other novels published since To Kill a Mockingbird. I first read To Kill a Mockingbird at school nearly three decades ago and since that time I must have read it at least once each year. This has helped me develop a deep understanding for Harper Lee's master work. The central characters of this book are two children Scout and Jem, who live with their father Atticus, a lawyer. The story is set in a fictional town called Maycombe in the depression ravaged 1930s America, though the people of America have just been told that the only thing they have to fear is fear itself.<br /><br />My favourite parts of this book are the way a child is able to disperse a murder intent mob, the power of the court room scenes and the way that the children eventually see things so clearly, maybe more clearly than any adult does throughout the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird. As Scout puts it: \\"...you never really understand somebody until you step into their shoes and walk around in them.\\" If we all applied that wisdom, how much better the world would be.<br /><br />I personally loved the way Harper Lee describes this small town and its quaint little ways, while at the same time realising that this quaintness hides attitudes that are tainted by class distinctions and prejudice. The book goes on to relate this prejudice that comes to the surface in a dramatic fashion and forces people to look very carefully at their own attitudes, while at the same time exposing a simple truth that when people have been brought up with deep prejudices it is very difficult to shake these off. But To Kill a Mockingbird demonstrates that when prejudice is confronted in the minds of those who are prejudiced then the truth can be very different to the one previously supposed.<br /><br />Nobody should make the mistake of thinking that this book should only be read by those who are at school doing their exams, because to miss reading this book would be a real shame. I would recommend that everybody buy this book and read it again and again. It is not without it's flaws but if you read it with an educated mind you will benefit from it's wisdom.o are at school doing their exams, because to miss reading this book would be a real shame.

I don't even have to read all the words anymore. \\"Where are baby's eye's? Under her... What's that say?\\" He giggles with delight and says,\\"HAT!\\" There are all sorts of games that have spurned because of the book, including our favorite: Where is Mama's/Daddy's belly button (with tickles of course!)? This book is also great for early word recognition. Nice choice.
B000BBOUU4|2.0|I watched this when I was little, so I wanted my kids to see it.  I remember it being strange, but I don't remember it being that strange.  It was so twisted that the 5 year old got bored and fell asleep, which he never does during a movie. The 8 year old asked me to turn it off after watching 3/4 of it.  If you just gotta see it, rent it and return it.
B000683VI4|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life....It hit me so hard....It is a beautiful love story about 2 young adults growing up, falling in love, taking different paths, and then reuniting.  I don't think anything else could have made this movie any better.  Rachel McAdams is beautiful and Ryan Gosling is GORGEOUS...This is the best love story I have seen in a LONG time.  It is so real....the love they had for each other....everyone should have a true love like that.  My favorite scene was the very ending (I can't spoil it to all you people who haven't seen it, but I CRIED MY EYES OUT!!)  It was really the saddest movie I have ever seen.  It was a great movie.  A well deserved 5 stars.
B00006LIRI|3.0|As my title implies, that's what I feel. U2 in the '90s is kind of unnecessary to a certain extent for singles, but it's actually not as bad as it sings. You were probably always humming along to \\"Beautiful Day\\", \\"One\\", and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" in the first place. And the music itself is pretty decent overall of the collection. So, may I tell you what's wrong with it?    The \\"new\\" mixes of the tracks are the biggest flaw. None do anything to enhance it, and in some cases they are actually sub-par. \\"Discotheque\\" is really kind of annoying on this new take, where the original was a great song. \\"Staring At the Sun\\" was one of the '90s U2 classics and is rather bland in this new take. \\"Numb\\" is decent but I'd rather stick with the original.... Also, the choices anyone? As far as I know, \\"Gone\\"'s remix was decent but the song had no business being on this compilation in any form. Neither did \\"The First Time\\" for that matter, a lesser song on the masterpiece \\"Zooropa\\". Then hits and fan favorites like \\"The Fly\\" are nowhere to be found, although they were singles. I can see why \\"Lemon\\" wasn't included though; that would sound out of place on this album.    On the good side though, quite a bit of non-album U2 is represented. The William Orbit mix of \\"Electrical Storm\\" is amazing, one of my favorite U2 songs ever. It's a nice Britpop song. \\"The Hand That Built America\\" is decent as well, although not amazing. The other non-album tracks include the \\"Batman & Robin\\" hit \\"Hold Me...\\", which is one of the closest things to industrial that U2 did in that decade. Its edginess showed why U2 were so much more than a run-of-the-mill pop band they would've been had they gone from \\"Joshua\\" to \\"ATYCLB\\". A track they did in their Passengers moniker appears as well, \\"Miss Sarajevo\\", which is really quite interesting. In addition, it includes the three classics I mentioned in the first half, which don't require a description of the excellence.    Without the flaws, this could have been a great retrospective of the second decade in U2's music. It was actually better in the 90s than the 80's in this person's humble opinion, but the compilation does not do anything to suggest that. Just take note of the stuff worth actually owning.
B00000342V|5.0|No serious music fan can be without some version of _Superfly_, it's really that simple... I agree with some reviewers here that the second disc in the 25th Annniv.  edition isn't all essential material. The one truly essential item on the second disc is \\"The Underground\\" (demo). It's insanely great - one of the best, most soulful grooves I've ever heard. A gift from the gods. Finding it is a little like having, say, \\"Penny Lane\\" turn up for the first time on one of the Beatles _Anthology_ records. <br />So... if you are a Curtis M. fan you *have* to have this track.
0783225857|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is without doubt Gregory Peck's finest work. When the author of To Kill a Mockingbird first saw Gregory Peck she was not convinced that he was the man to play the central role of Atticus Finch, indeed she thought him too young. But when she first saw Gregory Peck playing Atticus she remarked that it was like seeing her beloved \\"Daddy\\". When you watch Gregory Peck playing Atticus Finch, he is so natural in the role, that you sense that he was born to play this role.<br /><br />This film's screenplay adaptation of Harper Lee's book concentrates mainly on the courtroom scenes. But this film also considers other elements from the book too, including the relationship between the three children Scout, Jem and Dill with Boo Radley. Look out for the scene where the children decide to investigate the Radley home under the cover of darkness, the courtroom scene where Atticus appeals to the jury and the scene where Scout stops a murder intent mob in it's tracks. Though shot in black and white this does not rob the film of it's impact, indeed I felt the lack of colour gives the film a raw power all of its own. Furthermore, I guarantee that after watching this film you will want to read or indeed reread the book.<br /><br />Both Gregory Peck's father and Harper Lee's father had sadly died soon after the end of production. Before Gregory Peck went to the Oscar ceremony Harper Lee gave him her father's gold watch for luck. It worked! At the Oscar ceremony Gregory Peck at long last received his highly deserved Oscar. A fitting tribute to a man that many people have come to view as Atticus Finch himself.
B000000H5K|5.0|I am huge fan of experimental and tribal percussion therefore I think Sepultura are amazing.  Max was a great vocalist (his build-up roaring is awe-inspiring) The guitar riffs are simple however the sound effects Andreas Kisser produce add such an eerie atmosphere.  Igor's amazing drumming on this album make it even more diverse and add technicality where the guitars miss out.  An amazing, diverse and rhythm driven album, buy it!!!!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|All three boys 8, 5 and 40 loved this movie.  The animation is unbelievable.  This is a great movie for surround sound.  Great for a child who is at the age where he/she is questioning if there is really a Santa or not.
B00003003R|5.0|To The Valdosta Kid: Your personall opinion of the band is not needed, no one cares if you like Dire Straits, that is not a review, so please grow up. <br /> <br />Anyway, this albulm is great. Axl and the boys are on fire, the preformances are wonderfull. Definiatly a must have for any GNR fan
B00003W8NM|5.0|Do you look through Ikea catalogues and get overly excited?  Do you spend more than 30 minutes getting ready in the morning?  Do you think about your next purchase on a daily basis?  If you said yes to any of these questions, and have yet to see this movie, then you must watch Fight Club. <br />    Possibly the best movie I have seen over the last 10 years (a very difficult statement to make), Fight Club is a dark satire about a man who is not happy with is life, and does not even know it.  Sound familiar, I'm sure it does. <br />     Brilliantly directed, photographed, and with amazing performances and charachters (Norton, Pitt and Carter at the top of their games), Fight Club has it all for you movie buffs out there.  Oh and the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers also perfectly fits the movies dark tone.  Be warned, this movie does not make you feel warm and fuzzy inside like a Shrek flick.  Instead it challenges the viewer to take a good hard look at their own life.   <br />     Do you feel like there is more to life than electronic gizmo's and cafe latee's, than check out the movie masterpiece that is Fight Club. <br /> <br />10/10
B000B8QEZG|4.0|...and you'll find a somewhat different Madonna molded from the same Madonna we knew from the 80's. While the seriousness from American Life and Ray of Light can still be found on some songs on Dancefloor, the music itself is reminiscent of disco pop, a sort of techno-disco-ish version of her 80's sound.<br /><br />One listen to the catchy \\"Hung Up,\\" the silly \\"I Love New York,\\" and the dark \\"How High,\\" you'll see that she's having fun again. Bringing in sounds from the disco era (\\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Future Lovers\\") to Daft Punk (\\"Get Together\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\") to even modern pop (\\"Push\\"), the disc is crafted to make the listener dance, even if some of the songs do start out and end the same. But that's just a little drawback; some of the best dance discs out there have been accused of repetitiveness.<br /><br />Clocking in at just a tad over 56 minutes, the disc is a blessing welcome in mainstream music nowadays, one which is filled with uninspired rap/hip-hop/R&B. Saying that Madonna has come back with a vengeance is an over-statement but rather, she has come back dancing again, infecting her long-time and new fans alike.
0553801503|1.0|Definatly not worth the wait, not only that he allowed his publishers to print only half the book. GRRM has fallen into the same genra now as Jordan, Goodkind, and other epics fantasy authors.. these people need to take a class in how to end a good saga while it  is still good.. Sadly we will get another 4 or 5 books like this, truthfully we dont need as many, but apparently he needs more money to buy more of his precious knights... A shame, the seriees started off so good, now it will end in shambles
B0000AQS6R|4.0|I've long been a fan of the \\"Vacation\\" films, as well as National Lampoon movies in general.  \\"Christmas Vacation\\" is the third-best Lampoon movie and the second-best of the \\"Vacation\\" series.  Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswold Jr., who is this time set on making this year's Christmas one to remember.  He did it. <br /> <br />Chase is at best and funniest.  Beverly D'Angelo returns as Ellen Griswold, with the Griswold kids now portrayed by Johnny Galecki and a young Juliette Lewis.  Diane Ladd, John Randolph, E.G. Marshall, and Doris Roberts are the grandparents.  Randy Quaid is hilarious in his return as Cousin Eddy.  Brian Doyle-Murray is, as always, great, as Clark's angry, cold-hearted boss.  Nicholas Guest and Julia Louis-Dreyfus play Clark's rich, stuck-up neighbors. <br /> <br />The soundtrack is actually very good.  It's filled with some great Christmas tunes, along with a good score by the amazing Angelo Badalamenti.   <br /> <br />John Hughes' script is terrific.  We can believe what the Griswold family is going through because we've gone through it too.  But Hughes' script isn't all laugh-out-loud comedy; at it's heart, it's a message about a caring father who tries to make the best Christmas for his family.  There's one scene where Clark can't get the Christmas lights to work, and all the family members say comforting things to him; I thought it was actually a pretty moving scene. <br /> <br />\\"Christmas Vacation\\" is great, hilarious Christmas fun.  If you're looking for a new movie this Christmas season, give this one a shot.
B000021XS0|5.0|If you're new to Dream Theater, it wouldn't be a bad idea to start here, as this album is up there with Images and Words and Awake. This album is a concept album that must be listened through from beginning to end to get the full effect. The music here is very complex but with a modern touch to it, giving it that classic rock/metal feel at times, while at the same time being very progressive. John Petrucci has a great guitar sound throughout the entire album - actually, every instrument comes through very clear in the mix. The reverb heard on previous records is now replaced by more of a roomy sound, which I think suits the band much better.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, Dream Theater has always been a band that musically pushes the envelope with each album, and on this album they have done it to a great degree. Five stars.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Since their debut, System of a Down have been one of the most original and pioneering bands in rock music. It is a testament to their quality as a band that their works have been so consistent and so true to their style. Their vision of a dual album Mesmerize/Hypnotize was an ambitious one. Double albums are always a tricky thing to pull off, and more bands have failed than succeeded in this regard. To this extent, System of a Down have to praised for so thoughtfully realizing and delivering a double album that does maintain unity. However, some slight errors of judgment by System of a Down leave this album a notch below classic status.  <br /> <br />Firstly, System made a wise choice by separating the release of each album by 6 months. Releasing them together would have been a bit too much to handle. \\"Attack\\", the opener of the album is all out hellfire. It is fierce and vicious, and Malakian and Dolmayan play it at a nearly superhuman speed. \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Kill Rock'N'Roll\\", and \\"Hypnotize\\" are all quality songs. \\"Tentative\\", \\"U-Fig\\", and \\"Holy Mountains\\" along with \\"Attack\\" have to be the best songs on the album. Overall, the quality of the lyrics in Hypnotize has drastically improved over Mesmerize. \\"Tentative\\" and \\"Holy Mountains\\" have some of the best choruses on the entire double CD set. <br /> <br />It is here where we are treated to some the worst System of a Down songs on this album (and possibly ever recorded). \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\", \\"She's Like Heroin\\", and \\"Lonely Day\\" are all frustratingly inert. From the wonderfully painful \\"Freedom! We're free!\\" of Holy Mountains, we are reduced to hearing \\"Terracotta banana\\" and Daron Malakian screaming \\"ASS!\\". The whole album has been gradually building upon itself, and these songs can best be called fillers. It truly is an anticlimax to everything that we have been treated to. In fact, as grand as the double album sounds, System of a Down have always been known for the economy. Several amazing songs from Steal this Album! just never made the cut into Toxicity (\\"Streamline\\" and \\"Bubbles\\" for example). One would have wished that System of a Down exhibited the same parsimony here. There are several songs in Mesmerize, but especially so in Hypnotize, that just did not need to be there. Instead of delivering two albums six months apart, System of a Down could have delivered one classic album, filled with all the unity and form that they wanted. It was an error of judgement in my opinion. <br /> <br />It is unfortunate that System of a Down set such high standards for themselves, because this album is still really, really good. It just does not live up to their other mesmerizing albums, \\"System of a Down\\", and especially \\"Toxicity.\\"

0307236722|5.0|Knowing how great Martha's recipes are I purchased this book only after seeing its cover on amazon.com. It's not about what it was about but because I knew I can depend on her for precise, great and imaginative yet edible ideas. <br /> <br />Upon opening this bible like manual for the precise art of baking, one notices how easy and creative the teaching approach of the book is. It's not a hard to comprehend manual with little words, yet it's not a dummy book that teaches you like a child . <br /> <br />I love how creative her ideas are, the cakes, cookies, tarts, popovers, pizzas, breads and pies. <br />The pages look like something out of a food version of a Vogue magazine. Each recipe has a gorgeous picture. I cannot stop panting and gushing about how great this book looks. It will defiantly get in you in the kitchen baking every weekend but it will excite you about this art. This book is a great fool proof guide and after baking a pumpkin pie last night from it, and having it turned out million items than my favorite recipe I am a believer. This book covers sweet and savory beaks, but mostly on sweets and breads. <br /> <br />This is a baking manual that is understandable yet gorgeous. Great quality and informative publishing from Stewart. Great job, I AM impressed.
B000059Z8J|5.0|I've been a superhero fan all my life.  I've especially loved superheroes in films and television shows.  There was just one superhero film I'd never seen - the original superhero film, without which we would have no \\"Batman Begins\\", no \\"X-Men\\", no \\"Spider-Man\\".  I needed to see \\"Superman\\". <br /> <br />The film begins on the planet of Krypton, where Jor-El (Marlon Brando) sentences three criminals to banishment.  Jor-El is aware that Krypton is about to be destroyed, but the Kryptonian elders refuse to believe him.  Moments before the planet is destroyed, Jor-El sends his one child, Kal-El, to Earth.   <br /> <br />Kal-El's spaceship crashes in Smallville, Kansas, where he is adopted by the loving Kent family (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford).  We flash forward to Kal-El - re-named Clark Kent - in his teenage years (played by Jeff East).  After his adopted father's death, Clark travels north, where he discovers the Fortress of Solitude, an enormous ice fortress where the spirit of his deceased father, Jor-El, rests.  After conferencing with his father for a long time, Clark Kent (now played by Christopher Reeve) travels to the city of Metropolis to aid humanity. <br /> <br />It's easy to see why this film is such a classic.  It's spectacular.  Director Richard Donner crafts a well-told, adventurous story that held my attention from beginning to end.  Christopher Reeve was an absolutely perfect choice for Superman; the differences between his portrayals of Clark Kent and Superman are truly magnificent.  Gene Hackman is at his best as the cheery, maniacal supervillan Lex Luthor, who is aided by an enjoyably foolish Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine as Mrs. Teschmacher.  Margot Kidder does a great job of showing how head-over-heels Lois Lane is for Superman.  And Marlon Brando is terrific in his nine or so minutes of screen time. <br /> <br />Another high point of the film is John Williams' fantastic score.  It's easy to hear why Williams' score is so popular amongst fansof the film.  It's everything the soundtrack to a Superman movie should be. <br /> <br />The script, by David & Leslie Newman, Robert Benton, and famous novelist Mario Puzo is, at times, epic.  It's well-written, funny, and it never lets up.  It also remains quite faithful to the comics which the film is based on.   <br /> <br />I'm mightly glad to have finally seen \\"Superman\\".  It's a fantastic film, still ranking amongst the very best superhero films nearly thirty years later.  I can hardly wait for \\"Superman Returns\\"! <br />----------------------------------------------------------- <br />THE DVD: I don't normally talk about the DVD in my reviews, but I've got to this time.  This DVD is spectacular.  Along with a bunch of great special features, the film looks amazing - brand new at times!  The Surround mix is really super, although the dialogue sounds a little dull and quiet at times.  \\"Superman\\" fans are in for a major treat!

Our purpose is to keep Mariah, the biggest female musical icon of all time, on top.     Unfortunately, the no-talent slut, Madonna, is still being referred to as the \\"Queen of Pop,\\" even though her most recent album, American Life, and her Reinvention Tour have really made her the \\"Queen of Flops.\\" Madonna used to be successful, but that's because she slept her way to the top.

Mariah's most recent Charmbracelet tour was a critically acclaimed smash that played to millions all over the world.

0743454537|5.0|I bought this book in an airplane gift shop of all places.  Needless to say, I did not have high hopes for it.  When I started to read it I was pleasently suprised by the author's use of narratives.  This story weaves inbetween past, present, and future.  It tells the tale of a thirteen-year-old girl named Anna, and her sister who has a rare form of cancer.  The ending is tragic and unexpected.  If you hate to cry this is not the book for you.  But this book is one of the most touching and beautifully written books I have ever read.
B000002L68|1.0|There are a couple of clever songs here and the band sounds okay, but frankly I just don't understand how anyone could enjoy this album that much.  In a couple of the songs, it seems that the lyrics are just being screeched or screamed out.  Who wants to hear a bunch of screeching?  Prince (or whatever he calls himself now) is too weird for me and there is so much more good rock music out there that this just isn't worth having in anyone's collection.  Maybe this was hot stuff at the time it came out; I just acquired it recently and after only one listen I am dumping it.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|In contrary to the review before this one , i think Daron's vocals are great, so stop arguing. This album is so good, songs like Attack, Kill rock n roll, Tentatve, Lonely day, Soldier side... ALL ALBUM ROCKS; BUY IT NOW!!!

This book connects well with \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\", which will allow you to get the right people in<br /><br />the right seat on the bus. Highly recommended...
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|I was not sure I was going to enjoy this movie, because I am a big fan if the original, but I did.  It is very similar, the humor is a little more juvenille and it is definetly a little more goofy- but what would you expect from Sandler... <br /> <br />Overall if you like other Adam Sandler movies and the original you will like this movie!  I bought after having seen it, so that says something.
0679422714|1.0|The book is an imaginative re-write of Chinese history in the vein of the newly done American neocon bios of Lenin, Stalin and new work on Spain and \\"the Gulag.\\"  Many of these books are produced by the Yale University Annals of Communism Project.  Jung and Halliday got a jump on the Yalies and make many bold NEW anti-communist assertions about Mao, Stalin, WWII, the Korean war, etc.   Unlike the neocons at Yale, Jung and Halliday are less sophisticated enthusiasts -- they overplay their hand. Their claims about Mao are so outrageous, and so obviously biased with anti-communism, that the book falls apart.  All their new sensational claims can either not be substantiaited or, in some cases, can be proved false -- but they are sensational. Here are just a few: 1) WWII was NOT started by the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937.  It was started on Stalin's orders via a Communist mole in the KMT who \\"provoked\\" the war AFTER this \\"incident\\".  2) Chiang Kaisheck protected the CCP during the Long March so that the CCP would not be defeated.  3)  Chiang lost the Civil war only because all his leading generals were Communist moles.  4)  Stalin provoked the Korean War and deliberately withheld the Russian veto in the Security Council that would have prevented war in the name of the UN.  Stalin's purpose was to punish the USA by letting Mao's troops chew up as many American soldiers as possible.  Stalin and Mao dragged out the war while Kim Il Sung begged them to stop.  Except for #4, which I think can be proved false, these are all in the \\"can't be proved\\" category.  The sources for these claims are interviews with surviving critics (or their spouses) of Mao and Stalin.  Very weak, and contradictory too. I will be on Bonnie Faulkner's KPFA (Berkeley) radio show on November 30, 2005, talking about this book. My interview may later be available on line in the KPFA archives.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Many people are giving this album 1 star just because they hate  <br />Madonna.... some of them haven't even listened to the album! <br /> <br />Well i give COADF 4 stars. I don't think it deserves 5 - i'll be realistic, but Madonna has some of the best songs of her career on this album! <br /> <br />Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry, Forbidden Love, Jump, Let It will be, and How High. <br /> <br />Wow, those songs just blow me away. I like most of the others as well, but these songs i've mentioned have reinvigorated my love in Madonna!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I really dislike Mariah Carey.  In fact my dislike is stronger than I care to really admit (hate is a little too strong)  I would love to give her album a 1 star review and post it, but I really can't as I have never listened to it, and never will.   <br />Alot of these reviews are being written from people who hate Madonna and basically want to average out her new album to a lower star rating.  As I said I dislike Mariah....but I don't have that sort of time and really can't be bothered with the effort. <br /> <br />Madonna had such a deep understanding of dance music, and dance culture, and the various different world dance music incorporates. <br />The New York sound is obviously used in 'I Love New York\\" and dance/rock song reminiscent of 'Ray Of Light' <br />Gay house/dance - 'Hung Up' and Sorry' <br />Trance/House - 'Future Lovers' <br /> <br />I could go on and on about this album, but many other reviewer have put it much better. <br /> <br />Madonna is still here and relevant for a reason.  You just need to listen.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Of course people think she is great, since non of her material is her material.  She steals all her ideas from other artist and then releases under her name.  This album, like all the rest of her albums, is a chaep rip off.  She aint pretty, she can't dance and she needs to retire and quit ripping off other more talented artist.  Give it up, Madonna, before your vericose veins start popping out. If they had -0 stars, this would be the lowest on that scale

0440242576|4.0|I didn't even know this book existed until the movie came out.  Then, I found out it was a John Grisham book!  Who would have thought that he could write comedy, too?  It just goes to show that he is a well-rounded writer with talents in more areas than just legal thrillers.<br /><br />I give it four stars because it is a very entertaining and quick read.  You can read and enjoy this book in as little as a weekend.  If you like the book, watch the movie.  It is pretty much identical to the book.  However, I did find that reading the book was more enjoyable than watching the movie since you can use your imagination as to how things unfold.<br /><br />Some parts of the book do seem a little over the top, but hey, it's fiction and comedy!  But, the book is more than a funny laugh, it also is a Christmas book at heart and helps reminds of the spirit of giving and selflessness for the season.  So, a little of bit drama and real-life wrapped up in a comedy as well.<br /><br />I plan to keep this one on my annual Christmas reading list along with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and other classics.<br /><br />Happy Reading!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is back once again, with a vengance, and set to rule the world.

The single has hit number one in atleast twenty places in the Globe now. As for the album, it's great stuff. Aswell as the Abba sampling on the first single, there's also a Donna Summer sampling (\\"Future Lovers\\"), a song which sounds like a \\"Love At First Sight\\" remake (\\"Get Together\\"), the rumoured second (\\"Sorry\\") and third (\\"Jump\\") singles, a song about Madonna's homage (\\"I Love New York\\"), and a song called \\"Forbidden Love\\" which you will recognise the name of because it was included on Madonna's 1994 album. There's some relaxing yet shaky and danceable songs (\\"Let It Will Be\\", \\"Like It Or Not\\"), a song that explores Madonna's robotic voice (\\"How High\\"), a slice of R'n'B edge across dance (\\"Push\\") and Madge's tribute to Kallabah (\\"Isaac\\"). Simply fantastic return.

Unfortunately, the no-talent slut, Madonna, is still being referred to as the \\"Queen of Pop,\\" even though her most recent album, American Life, and her Reinvention Tour have really made her the \\"Queen of Flops.\\" Madonna used to be successful, but that's because she slept her way to the top. Mariah, on the other hand, has sold millions of records based solely on her amazing talents and being a great role model.     Mariah has had sixteen number one singles. Her last two number one singles, \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" have broken worldwide records everywhere. Mariah's most recent Charmbracelet tour was a critically acclaimed smash that played to millions all over the world. Roger Friedman, a well respected music journalist, called the concert one of the greatest he's seen in the past ten years. Mariah is, indeed, the biggest musical sensation since the Beatles.     Within the next couple months, Madonna will try to take away Mariah's crown by releasing \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" along with the single, \\"Hung Up.\\" There seems to be a lot of buzz , but most of it seems generated by Madonna's desperate, pathetic fans.

0307276902|2.0|My husband has been in AA for 18 years, and I've been in Al-anon for the same amount of time.  I've seen a lot of people pass through the rooms of 12-step programs and I would be very interested in seeing how James F. is doing in 5 or 10 years.  I hope he is able to remain sober, however his inability to work on his character defects is not a good sign.   <br /> <br />Many addicts and alcoholics are great con artists, very bright and very slick - so it is with Mr. F.  Some of the things he describes as having happened at Hazelden are fictional. There are no bars, no chorus of screams coming from the detox unit, no withholding of anesthetics for major dental surgery, and no allowing a patient in his physical condition directly into treatment.  He would have been treated at a hospital first-then sent to treatment. <br /> <br />The quick trip to Paris to beat a priest to death (or not, he's not certain) was unbelievable although his version doesn't allow for validation.  <br /> <br />For people not directly affected by a personal need or the need of a loved one to  recover this book is pure entertainment but it's dangerous for anyone who is trying to find their way out of the insanity of addicition. <br /> <br />I gave it 2 stars strictly for the storytelling - although one star would have been a better choice since he mislabeledd his book as non-fiction when it's obvious a great portion comes from his own imagination and Fury.
B000002N3J|5.0|Something To Remember is well and truly exactly what it says it is. This collection of wonderful ballads from Madonna's career ranges from back in 1984 down twelve years to 1996. There are some classic gems in this package (\\"Take A Bow\\", \\"Oh Father\\", \\"Live To Tell\\", \\"Rain\\"), yet there are Madonna songs that never made any other of her albums (\\"This Used To Be My Playground\\"), and there are also new songs (\\"You'll See\\", \\"I Want You\\", \\"One More Chance\\"). There's also the delightful \\"I'll Remember\\" and songs that weren't singles but made this collection anyway (\\"Forbidden Love\\", \\"Something To Remember\\"). Some versions also appear as remixed forms (\\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\", and even though it also appeared as an original version and a new song, \\"I Want You\\"). This is a golden treasure for any Madonna fan who doesn't have the originals, and well and truly is, something to remember.

B000B8QEYC|4.0|I love Enya! She's the best thing to happen to the upper echelons of pop since Judy Collins decided to leave the pretentious, Trekkie-like world of folk behind. HOWEVER, this album could have been a TAD better! There is no tune that leaps out at you, as with her other releases. The whole album sounds like \\"The Further Adventures of A Day Without Rain\\", with the pizzicato strings and reflective lyrics. After five years, Eithne, me colleen, ye should have been blessed by yer muse a wee bit better than THIS!<br /><br />Maybe I'm being unkind....maybe I should listen to the album more, but so far, the title song, \\"Amarantine\\", \\"It's In The Rain\\", \\"Sumiregusa\\" and \\"Amid The Falling Snow\\" are the only ones that you remember, and, like I said, they could have easily been plucked from \\"Day Without Rain\\". I have to admit, though, that \\"Sumiregusa\\", the seventh cut on the album, is beautiful! GREAT work, Enya!<br /><br />A slight shock might hit Enya fans when they listen to \\"It's In The Rain\\", since there's an inflection in Enya's voice that they probably haven't heard before that might put you in mind of Dolores O'Riordan from The Cranberries. I half expect her to start yelling \\"Zombie!\\" any minute! There's one tune here (\\"The River Sings\\") that sounds like \\"Ebudae Pt. II\\", as it mimics the tune from \\"Shepherd Moons\\" that sounds like the perfect marriage of an Amerind rain chant and a slo-mo Irish jig, only this time sped up considerably. I still recommend this album, as I would anything produced by this voice from Heaven, but I must admit to being a bit underwhelmed.<br /><br />All in all, this album seems like a reminiscence of \\"Enya Past\\" rather than a forging of new frontiers, which \\"A Day Without Rain\\" sounded like it could have been. Please....though this holds up well to repeated listenings, Enya, knock our socks off on the next one...AND DON'T TAKE SO LONG THIS TIME!!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'm gonna start of by saying this...<br /><br />If you do NOT like dance/techno music, this album is not for you!<br /><br />Madonna has done it again...but even better.  She's come back to the dance era, where she began.  I can't seem to put this cd away.  The best thing about this album is how each track meshes in with the next, just like being at a club.  The music is so good, upbeat and makes you wanna dance dance dance.<br /><br />I have to say that the only track I don't care for is \\"I Love NY.\\"  Don't care for the lyrics&lt;--but it has a great beat.  All the rest of the songs are great!  My fav tho is \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Let It Will Be.\\"<br /><br />All in all, well done Madonna!  Nice to see ya getting back to where you began...with dance music.  I strongly recommend this cd, you will not be disappointed. Still skeptic, than listen before buying.
B000092Q4U|3.0|First, let me repeat myself, I DO like modern hardcore metal, but mainly for the musicianship, not particularly for the lyrical content, and definitely NOT for the vocal style !!! The main point I'm trying to make is that just because I don't like something,that doesn't mean it sucks ! It just means I'd rather listen to something else.I'm not a huge Ashlee Simpson fan and I don't like her public image at all, but I defend my right to say that I enjoy some of her music just as I'll defend your right to not like it and to like metal instead. Again, being an old man (43), I've learned that every one has different tastes and that none of them are good or bad, they're just different that's all, and that everyone is entitled to their own opinion as to what they like or don't like. Here's an opinion  of mine (actually, more of an observation), and that is that the music you listen to can definitely affect the way you think and feel and influence your overall outlook on life in general. That's why when I listen to hardcore metal I can understand the anger and the energy that listening to it creates and that's totally OK, but for me, and again this is just MY preference, I prefer to listen to a lot of somewhat mindless, happy pop music because it just improves my mood to where I want it to be. If I want to feel angry, I listen to metal, if not, I don't, it's really that simple. And just to put this out there to all the artists that write about how life sucks and they want to die, etc...,Kurt Cobain talked the talk, and then ultimately walked the walk by committing suicide. Now THAT'S real.A lot of these artists are just writing stuff to appeal to their target audiences and that makes them just as big a sellout as everyone accused Kurt Cobain of being but he wasn't just writing for the audience, he was FOR REAL !!! OK, that's all I have to say about that (ala Forrest Gump) So anyway, just listen to what you want but grant me the right to listen to what I want (do unto others). And here's a final tip : Nobody can shove stuff down your throat if you just keep your mouth shut!!! Peace!!!. And here's a final tip : Nobody can shove stuff down your throat if you just keep your mouth shut!!! Peace!!!
0743454529|1.0|Serious subject + daytime soap opera techniques = this book. I was disappointed that the author felt it necessary to jack up the pathos to the point where I could not care about any of the characters. OF COURSE the mom used to be a lawyer and takes on her daughters case, AGAINST her daughter. OF COURSE the ad litem guardian appointed is the long lost love of the lawyer. OF COURSE mom and dad met when he literally saved her life in a flooded parking lot. OF COURSE misunderstood son lights fires to get attention from his fire fighting father. I sat at my own sister's deathbed this summer, so perhaps I'm hypersensitive. But if you want a truly thought provoking or sensitive treatment of death and loss, don't read this book. <br /> <br />As for the big plot twist at the end, I summarized the plot of the first 2/3 of the book to my husband in the car before skimming the rest, and he called the ending. So much for tragic surprises.  <br /> <br />I'm sure the author has her medical facts right- the reader is overwhelmed with them - but true emotion is missing. I found the story trite and downright manipulative.
0553801503|2.0|The Song of Ice and Fire has turned to glacial ice and a fizzle. <br /> <br />I could not stop reading the first three books, but this turned into slow moving minor characters fully centered on side events and blundering, I mean political manuevering.  While it is good that GRRM has worked on fully developing his fantasy, does he really have to tell us every stupefying detail?  I know many like neverending soap operas and will like what has turned into a soap opera fantasy, but GRRM has almost lost the rest of us.  The characters in the earlier books that died were heartbreaking (or satisfying if they were villians), but in this book, I was wishing for their demise and disappointed that GRRM did not kill off enough of them.
0743267478|5.0|Despite heartrending descriptions of sexual abuse, racism, poverty, homeless and much, much, more in modern India, this is an utterly enjoyable picaresque adventure that is one of the best reads of the year. In the hands of another author, the brief life story Ram Mohammad Thomas would probably be told as a simple tearjerker tragedy and the reader would be left to shake their head sorrowfully at the plight of another poor third-world soul. However, Swarup has a gimmick framework up his sleeve, and it works like a charm. Granted, one has to be willing to go along with the premise that this entire structure is based on coincidence of colossal proportions -- readers who aren't willing to suspend disbelief will probably not last more than a few chapters.<br /><br />We first meet the 18-year-old protagonist in jail, where he sits accused of defrauding the popular TV game show \\"Who Wants to Be A Billionaire?\\" (in rupees). Despite being abandoned at birth, uneducated, and left to fend for himself for most of his life, it seems Ram somehow managed to answer the show's twelve questions correctly. To all outside observers, his social standing and lack of education appear to preclude this happening legitimately. However, just as the police are about to unleash some heavy manners on him, a mysterious lawyer intervenes and takes him away. The story then unfolds question by question, as Ram tells her via flashbacks to his life just how he managed to know each answer.<br /><br />Ram's life story unfolds as a series of episodes ranging from the horrific to the merely tragicomic, and in a sense, one can view him as emblematic of India's lost children, and the book as caustic social commentary on contemporary India. Aside from being abandoned at birth, he must contend with a pedophile priest, a closeted homosexual movie star, a violent, drunken neighbor bent on incest, international espionage, child slavery, numerous thieves, a suicidal employer, and the deaths of several close friends. And yet, despite this bleak subject matter, the intrepid Ram keeps doggedly moving forward and surviving. This isn't done in a sentimental, \\"triumph of the human sprit\\", after-school special way, but in a straightforward manner that shows a confused young boy doing whatever it takes to live. And of course, the ultimate moral of the story is that those who keep their eyes and ears open in life can learn a lot about it without any books. An excellent story, well-told, and doubtless to be made into a film.friends. And yet, despite this bleak subject matter, the intrepid Ram keeps doggedly moving forward and surviving.

0307276902|4.0|This was a very compelling book and was difficult to put down.  For anyone wanting to understand what it's like to be an alcoholic or drug addict and a person going through recovery, this is mesmerizing.  There is a stream-of-consciousness writing style, which I didn't particularly like or dislike, but I suppose it did make the story grittier and more real. <br /> <br />As a bit of a spoiler, one of the more controversial aspects of this book is the fact that Frey completely rejects the 12 steps approach of AA.  At the treatment center, he often treats his therapists with disrespect, plays cards while important speakers talk, and nearly gets himself kicked out two times.  For someone who is close to the reality of addiction, I can imagine this account and his perspective may be troubling, as AA has undoubtedly saved untold numbers of lives.  However, I don't think Frey is arguing, as some reviewers have suggested, that AA is wrong for *everyone* - clearly he despises the program and its methodologies, but he rejects it only for himself.  I suppose he does judge others who have found solace through AA as \\"weak,\\" and throughout the book there certainly is a toughness and an arrogance to him, but I don't believe he really holds any particular grudge against these people. <br /> <br />Instead, Frey finds solace in the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu, in his relationship with Lilly, in the relationships he gradually builds with some of the therapists at the center, and in his realization that his addiction is not a disease but is a choice that he can control.  This was one of the more compelling passages in the book I believe, where he distinguishes between diseases such as cancer over which the individual has little choice or control, and alcoholism or addiction which, he argues, are much more so a matter of choice and control.  I'm sure many alcoholics and addicts and their families will dispute this, but I believe there is a legitimate other side here that Frey exposes. <br /> <br />Again, is this possible for everyone - could you put a glass of liquor in front of any recovering alcoholic and would they reject it as he did? - of course not.  But I didn't find him to be proseletyzing in this book, telling other people what to do - he was simply telling his *own* story.  And it is an extremely gritty story to tell (this is NOT an easy read, many disturbing passages), one that can make a person begin to understand the horrifying reality of addiction.
0307276902|5.0|This book grabbed from the first paragraph and kept me mesmorized until the very last line.  What makes it different from some of the other popular rehab books like Dry, etc. are the vivid and realistic characters Frey describes and developes throughout the book.  Frey's skillful mastery of  language to show, not tell, his state of mind makes for an honest and not always pretty read.  My bet is that when (not if) this is taken to film, the exquisitely written dental scene will replace the Dustin Hoffman Marathon Mail as the archetype dental office horror footage. It's all an extremely personal and honest account, a great book club read. Recommend it very highly.
B000006NUW|5.0|The sound is terrific-fresh, clean and crisp. Don't be too concerned with complaints about the set being in Mono-the fact is that this does not matter. What's important is NOT whether the songs are in stereo or mono, but how well the track is mixed and balanced. In the 60's, stereo mixing was mostly an afterthought, where most of the effort went into getting a well balanced mono mix for the 45 rpm market. These mono mixes may very well represent the original intentions of the artist and producers over the stereo versions. <br /> <br />The set represents how fine mono mixes can be, as good as some of the mono mixes of 60's recording pioneer Joe Meek in the UK.
0307276902|3.0|If anything this is a great story to share with youth to establish a fear of what addiction can be like.  On the other hand some of the material seems, well, perhaps a bit stretched.  This is an extremely expensive detox rehab center.  Would they allow one of their clients to have two root canals without anesthesia?  Seems somewhat barbaric!!  In addition, the detective scene at the end of the novel where he is able to hunt down his girl friend in practically no time in a crack house??  I am sorry for being cynical, I am just trying to tell it like it is.  Otherwise, the book is well written in a diary like format.  It is a page turner and will be hard to put down once you are into the book.

B00000J7A2|5.0|Without a doubt the captain's most commercial and publicly attainable album.  This makes it the perfect place to start or to back off to when you need a break from avant gaurd.  The most prominent feature on the production is, of course, the Muddy Water, Pigpen growl of a voice that is the genius Beefheart.  His delta blues mannerisms are evident throughout the album , especially in the bluesy and semi uptempo \\"Sure Enough and Yes I Do\\"; Ry Cooder covering the slide part extremely well.  This is certanly blues, but not as we have all come to know and love it.    The ryhthm section of the Magic Band truly shine on this recording.  The bass and percussion breakdowns of \\"Zig Zag Wanderer\\" and \\"Abba Zabba\\" are absolutely phenomenal.  Proof that you don't need to show off and squese as many notes as possible into each second to sound great.  Cooder does an excellent job and certanly shows his influence as well.  The rest of the magic band pull together to make a good, straight ahead(at least for them) album.    \\"Call on Me\\" is an interesting little pop number in the style of Otis Redding.  It's one of the low points on the  album, but that's not saying much.  This fades directly into the in-your-face blues-rock romp of \\"Dropout Boogie\\".  The lines-you wanna do what-I told you what and n' what about after that-always get stuck in my head for a while.  The little instrumental dittle, ding da ding da ding, you know, that part, is pretty damn cool aswell. \\"I'm Glad\\" always reminds me of a Zappa and the Mother's song (in a good way)    The thumping-hardhitting \\"Electricity\\" is a favorite of mine.  The high pitched voice covering the lines- High voltage man kisses night to bring the light to those who need to hide their shadow deed etc.-are extremely well done.  This song starts out a couple of my favorite songs on the album, including the phycadelic \\"Yellow Brick Road\\" and the amazing \\"Abba Zabba\\".    \\"Plastic Factory\\" does remind me of Pigpen and the Dead playing electric blues like Big Boss Man or Smokestack Lightning.  I was surprised to see that others had heard this connection, but it only makes sense.  This is considered a compliment to the captain because the Dead with Pigpen were absolutely unstoppable. Beefheart is a better harmonica player and has a better style and deliverance, but Pigpen combined with the Dead certainly stand up quite well to this album on alot of occurances. \\"Grown so Ugly\\" has kind of the same effect, but it leans much more toward the Led Zeppelin side of things.  \\"Autumn's Child\\" and \\"Where There's Woman\\" are great phycadelic blues ballads that wrap up the album.    That ends the original brilliant album entiteled Safe As Milk, but I think the bonus songs truly add something to the album, especially \\"Safe as Milk\\".  Alot of these songs, or alternate versions of these songs are featured on The Mirror Man Sessions, I May Be Hungry But I Sure Ain't Weird, and Strictly Personal(I recommend these as well).  They were all originally going to be on a double album called \\"Plain Brown Wrapper\\" and would be better in this form.  These song's are the Captian's beginings into wierd phycadelia and add alot to the straight ahead feel of the original album.  They show a true progression towards Trout Mask and Lick My Decals Off, the pinnicle of beefheart and the Magic Band's work.  Overall this is the perfect album for a begginer or long time fan who needs a break from the sometimes esoteric music of later albums.
0446577383|2.0|Baldacci has written some of the best thrillers of the past decade,  almost all rating 5 stars. But \\"The Camel Club\\" has hit the wall. The first 250 pages are traditionally pure Baldacci, and promise a great read. But it ends there, it is almost as though he has written himself into a corner and suspended all rational, logical plotting thoughts and threw in a ludicrous set of plot points that just didn't quite seem possible. The idea of the Camel Club I felt, right from the get go was a terrific means of getting into a high tension thriller, much like \\"Absolute Power\\", but then, it fizzled to a point where I almost could be pursuaded to believe someone who had never written a work of fiction had been handed the task of completing the book in record time and simply lost interest in the project.
B0000024ZT|5.0|The title of my review is just one example of the brillant lyrical images on this album. <br />This album has gotten a lot of crazy comments but those people don't know great art when they hear it. <br />This is one of the GREATEST debut albums in the history of rock-n-roll!!
0156027321|5.0|I just finished reading this book, \\"Life of Pi.\\" It is a fantastic tale, and is the most interesting story I've ever read.  I couldn't put the book down when I began reading from the first pages. <br /> <br />The author throws you off at every turn with unlikely events - just the way I like to be entertained.  It's a continuous exercise for your imagination.  If you love reading fiction, you must read this book.  The author's use of creative language incited all my senses throughout the story.  The setup for each event is descriptive and brilliant.  If I didn't know better, I would assume the author is a chess master or pool shark. <br /> <br />The story stimulates many human emotions.  It is funny, sad, brutal, horrific and unpredictable.  It makes you think.  I was a bit tad disappointed with the ending of the story.  However, it isn't a total let down as it is only brief.  In fact, the ending challenges the reader to draw his/her own conclusion.
B0002BO0AS|2.0|First off let me start off by saying that I came into this review without bias.  I have been out of the loop for past 2 years when it comes to mainstream metal scene.  I am an under grounder I listen primarily to Gore/Grind/Death/Brutal/Ultra Brutal/Melodic Death/Black/Death/Death Thrash/Thrash Metal bands.  However don't go pigeonholing me so easily.  I run the gamut when it comes to music. I listen to everything from Charley Patton to Muddy Waters to Charlie Parker to Miles Davis to Little Richard (The first rock and roll I ever heard...and still my favorite) to Rush to Slayer to Emerson Lake and Palmer to NWA to Bluegrass to Kenny Rogers to Herb Alpert to Ennio Morricone to Master P to Middle Eastern and African and Mexican Music to well I think you get the idea.  My motto is if it sounds good I will listen to no matter what anyone says my opinion is what counts mine and only mine.  I decided to write this review because I see many people either praising or completely bashing this type of music. I thought well I'll a review of the music and style not trends or biases.  Ok, first I like hardcore Warzone, Hatebreed, D.R.I., Biohazard, Sick of it All, Full Blown Chaos, Agnostic Front, Minor Threat, Blood For Blood, and other NYHC bands. Also I like Metal Bands like Soilwork(Some of it), In Flames, Children of Bodom, Arch Enemy, At the Gates, Dark Tranquility.  So where do we go from here? Rather than me compare these bands to their influences which are very obvious let start off by saying that sadly most of the these bands do sound a lot like each other, not just a little but a LOT.  Ok Ok ok the same could be said for other metal bands but come on breakdowns(I have my own grip with this word...they are NOT called breakdowns they are called less technical solos GET IT.) are good but for the whole to be one big \\"Breakdown\\" is just really really annoying. Also, I did get into some the songs but as soon as got ready to jump out of my chair they began to actually sing the chorus I mean Taking Back Sunday and Dashboard confessional sing them, this almost made me want to punch my friend for showing this type of music It builds you up only to really really let you down. I mean Green Day's American Idiot has some singing but that is to be expected from them not this, Trust me there is a good way to sing the chorus and none of them do it effectively. Originality apparently is not a high point of these bands and well that's the sad part I mean I don't care what tours they are on or how many times they get played on MTV I really don't, just have something that people can say wow that's original or hey I think that is a good idea they used that.  These bands just lack it.  I mean there are some stand outs but not many only five come to mind Yakuza, Burnt by the Sun, Mastodon, The Black Dahlia Murder and some Darkest Hour. That's it out of seriously dozen's of bands only these five and they aren't even the most popular of the bunch, but do stand out.  KSE, Unearth(NOT TO BE CONFUESED WITH UNEARTHED), Trivium, Lamb of God, Norma Jean, and well I guess you know the rest, are not mediocre bands but they are NOT groundbreaking either.  Every Metal/Hardcore Fan knows that there is this spark this THING that a band has to have to make it truly great (If you are a MUSIC fan you know what I am talking about also) and these bands just miss it.  Then again if you are into metalcore for the fashion and the trend then Hey what ever floats your boat but don't act like you are in it for music that just makes you look childish and immature.  Oh and BTW Hardcore plus Metal are not new listen to D.R.I. and Cryptic Slaughter and tell me this stuff now a days is cutting edge(minus the singing), it just goes to show there is nothing new under the sun but remember INNOVATION is not the same as invention.  Innovation is what is lacking from these bands also. Finally, I would just like to add that music is music but for it to be truly great it has to have that THING I was talking about.  You strive to find it and you will never be disappointed.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I came here to write a review about this album, expecting to be the only one this crazy about this album. But glancing through the reviews, it seems that a LOT of people are fanatical about this album like I am. <br /> <br />I bought this album on a whim after having had the first album for so long. I figured I'd give it a go. The album showed up (i got it used from this site) and I popped it in. Fast forward a week, and it was still the only CD I had listened to. I probably listen to this album every other day. <br /> <br />There really, honestly isn't a bad track on it. My least favorite moments are probably the rap section of Dirty Harry, and the track \\"White Light\\". But even those are listenable, and I still find myself singing along. <br /> <br />This album sounds like Pink Floyd, if Bob Dylan were the lead singer. There are moments on this album (the end of \\"Kids with Guns\\", \\"El Manana\\" that sound like they could have been taken off Pink Floyd's \\"Meddle\\" album. <br /> <br />All in all, this is probably one of my favorite albums of all time. I don't give that title out lightly, but something about this album is just... golden.
B0002S94OS|2.0|First off let me start off by saying that I came into this review without bias.  I have been out of the loop for past 2 years when it comes to mainstream metal scene.  I am an under grounder I listen primarily to Gore/Grind/Death/Brutal/Ultra Brutal/Melodic Death/Black/Death/Death Thrash/Thrash Metal bands.  However don't go pigeonholing me so easily.  I run the gamut when it comes to music. I listen to everything from Charley Patton to Muddy Waters to Charlie Parker to Miles Davis to Little Richard (The first rock and roll I ever heard...and still my favorite) to Rush to Slayer to Emerson Lake and Palmer to NWA to Bluegrass to Kenny Rogers to Herb Alpert to Ennio Morricone to Master P to Middle Eastern and African and Mexican Music to well I think you get the idea.  My motto is if it sounds good I will listen to no matter what anyone says my opinion is what counts mine and only mine.  I decided to write this review because I see many people either praising or completely bashing this type of music. I thought well I'll a review of the music and style not trends or biases.  Ok, first I like hardcore Warzone, Hatebreed, D.R.I., Biohazard, Sick of it All, Full Blown Chaos, Agnostic Front, Minor Threat, Blood For Blood, and other NYHC bands. Also I like Metal Bands like Soilwork(Some of it), In Flames, Children of Bodom, Arch Enemy, At the Gates, Dark Tranquility.  So where do we go from here? Rather than me compare these bands to their influences which are very obvious let start off by saying that sadly most of the these bands do sound a lot like each other, not just a little but a LOT.  Ok Ok ok the same could be said for other metal bands but come on breakdowns(I have my own grip with this word...they are NOT called breakdowns they are called less technical solos GET IT.) are good but for the whole to be one big \\"Breakdown\\" is just really really annoying. Also, I did get into some the songs but as soon as got ready to jump out of my chair they began to actually sing the chorus I mean Taking Back Sunday and Dashboard confessional sing them, this almost made me want to punch my friend for showing this type of music It builds you up only to really really let you down.

B000069AUI|3.0|I wanted to give it 2.5 stars.  A lot of albums sound okay, but aren't really engaging enough to buy; this is one of those.  \\"Clocks\\" experienced for the very first time late at night on a decent-fidelity GM Delco car radio is undeniably memorable.  But then you play it back in your head later, and you know what? <br /> <br />It's a Bruce Hornsby and the Range.  It's Bruce Hornsby and the Range crossed with Elton John's \\"Love Lies Bleeding.\\" <br /> <br />With a little U2 thrown in for good measure. <br /> <br />And that's just Clocks.  The rest of the album is competent enough; it plays out okay enough.  A little sad-sack for what it is.  It's basically a competent, not really strong-enough-to-actually-buy album.
0141439807|5.0|Ask twenty booklovers which is their favorite work by Jane Austen, and eighteen will probably say \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  I love \\"P&P\\" myself; I've read it umpteen zillion times and can quote whole paragraphs by heart; but as charming as it is, it's not Austen's best book.  That honor belongs to \\"Mansfield Park\\", a much deeper, more thoughtful work, written at least a decade later, at a time when rural England was beginning to feel the first effects of the Industrial Revolution; and Austen, classicist as she was, stood firm in the trenches holding onto the timeless values of stability, morality and old-fashioned uprightness.  These values are thoroughly realized in Fanny Price, and perhaps it attests to Austen's genius that the \\"heroine\\" of such a great work is such a totally exasperating individual.<br /><br />Fanny is a royal pain in the butt.  She is so irritating at times that the reader wants to slap her upside the head.  She's a loathsome little moralizing, sanctimonious goody-goody, sitting timidly in her corner passing judgments on everybody according to her own stringent, narrow-minded standards, secretly pining for her handsome cousin Edmund who, of course, is after a young woman Fanny deems unworthy of him.  She is totally humorless, an impossible killjoy, and seems to think she is the final arbitor on every moral question.  In fact, once you take away all the judging and moralizing, there doesn't seem to be much to Fanny at all.<br /><br />Austen has created some interesting characters in this book, and three of them present a problem.  The first, of course, is Fanny herself.  Then there is her horrible Aunt Norris, who is so much a caricature of evil that she seems to be a prototype for Cinderella's wicked stepmother.  In fact, many readers have compared Fanny to Cinderella, but this is not the case.  Although Fanny comes to Mansfield Park as a poor relation, she is not mistreated by anyone in the house except for Aunt Norris.  And then there is her cousin Edmund Bertram, Fanny's champion and protector, who is one of the most puzzling characters in \\"Mansfield Park\\".<br /><br />I've never seen a sympathetic character become so thoroughly unsympathetic as Edmund Bertram.  We certainly like him a lot in the beginning; he keeps Fanny from feeling lonely and neglected, and shields her from the constant badgering of their loathsome aunt.  He's warm and open-hearted where Fanny seems cold and unyielding.  When he falls in love with Mary Crawford, the reader can sense they are hopelessly mismatched, but she's a much more appealing character than Fanny.  There's not a mean or moralizing bone in her body; she's generous and kind, and if she's also shallow and materialistic, well, nobody's perfect.  But when Edmund's sister Maria drops the bomb that blows the family apart and runs away from a loveless marriage to elope with Mary's brother Henry, who has declared himself in love with Fanny, Edmund turns into a block of ice.  He not only can't understand Mary wanting to limit the damage, he decides Mary is corrupt herself for attempting to do so.  Edmund drops poor Mary like a hot potato.  From being a sympathetic and likeable character, Edmund now appears as a sanctimonious prig; unable to understand and forgive, concerned only with passing judgment.  He and Fanny are made for each other.<br /><br />The biggest problem of all with this book is the ending.  After thoroughly developing the plot and the characters, Austen all of a sudden decides to wrap it up as expeditiously as possible.  So in three chapters she dispenses with Maria's adultery and its devastating effects on both the Bertram and Crawford families, Edmund dumping Mary and marrying Fanny, Maria's banishment, Julia's elopement, and ties everything up in a neat little package.  Convenient, except that it feels hurried and contrived.  This is no way to end a great book.<br /><br />What does Mansfield Park itself finally stand for?  Like its owner, Sir Thomas Bertram, it's a bastion of stability in a rapidly changing world, rolling up the barricades against the forces that threaten it.  But Mansfield Park is flawed itself, built and maintained as it is on the hellish cruelty of West Indian slave labor,and we come to realize that both Mansfield Park, and Fanny herself, represent a last stand against the forces of a rapidly changing world that, for better or worse, will sooner or later render them obsolete.  Perhaps Jane Austen saw it coming herself, which would account for the dark undertone of the book.  It's the most profound of her six novels, and for this reader, her best book.<br /><br />Judy Lind, it's a bastion of stability in a rapidly changing world, rolling up the barricades against the forces that threaten it.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Sometimes I hate myself for liking Coldplay so much, because really...they aren't anything too out of this world. They aren't very original and don't sound too different from everything else on the radio. And yet I have all 3 of their cds and they get regular play.  First cd is really mellow and almost pure atmosphere music. 2nd cd has a lot of hits and was highly acclaimed and blah blah blah. This is the one that spawned the radio darlings Clocks and The Scientist.  But anyway, back to x&y- or should I say, the mock U2 album. I swear they must've studied every U2 guitar book they could get their hands on because on nearly every song I hear these familiar chords and think what the hell...? wait a minute..?<br /><br /> But it still works, and the songs are still good. Chris Martin's got one of the best falsettos out there and even though the lyrics are really simple and almost cheesy at times, they still get stuck in your head and you still develop a rather large soft spot for them.  They've got a knack for writing really great emotive love songs. They take the everyday and make you sing along to it. It's as if you could've said/thought of all the same things, but for some reason it wasn't validated until you heard Coldplay sing it.<br /><br />x&y sounds like they went to space and back. it's full of dynamic catchy swirling melodies...more intricate than any of their other stuff. not much is new lyrics wise, they pose all the same questions.... present all the same musings on love and life and confusion, but nevertheless it's classic coldplay and just as addictive as everything else they've put out.  I'd like to see them live someday, but their ticket prices are ridiculous and they sell out within an hour. Dammit!
B000AM6MKU|2.0|**1/2    I can imagine the thousands of hours of caring work it took to render this animation in such detail.  Wish the creators had spent a few hundred hours with better plot and character development--not much spirit and warm-heartedness here.
0553801503|2.0|Sadly, not worth the wait.  Disjointed plot lines are hard to follow after two or three years between books.  Nothing seems to start to happen until after page 300.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is VERY funny. Children of all ages will enjoy its humor and good message.<br /><br />Unlike most comedy movies of today, it is not rude at all. Will Ferrell does a good job at keeping the audience laughing and the plot moves smoothly.<br /><br />Even if you've never seen this movie, it's worth buying.
B000002MTU|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. This is the only Clapton cd you will ever need. Everything on here is amazing. It's Clapton at his absolute best. I saw Cream, Blind Faith, and Clapton's solo tours and I have all the cds/lps, but there is nothing that compares to this. It's all here. Every great lick.
B000066C6F|1.0|This DVD is a waste. <br />They should've included Jermaine Jackson's  <br />music video Closest Thing To Perfect. <br />I read somewhere else online that  <br />Jamie Lee Curtis was in the video. <br />When they bring these movies on DVD, they need to  <br />include extras like the music videos off the soundtracks. <br />I don't understand why some do and others don't. <br />Some company executives just don't know what they're doing. <br />Don't waste your money on this DVD with no extras. <br /> <br />Scott <br /> <br />
B000B8QF00|4.0|Oh, get over your highfalutin self already and admit it - there is an iota within you that admires this angst-ridden teen turned mystical pseudo-philosopher psycho-babbler. Sure, there are more words stuffed within as little a stanza than a Thanksgiving dinner bird, but why state something bluntly when a histrionic diatribe will do?  That said, there's something sweet about her verbology - her sometimes bombastically clumsy lyrics juxtapose with her astute deftness [face it, some of her topics are archetypal], and the adamant, nasal shrill from the confused, adamant nasal little girl of the colossal debut metamorphoses into an assured, steadfast woman of the soundscan also-ran.  She's always had her own sound, so don't blame this idol for her less-than-convincing worshippers.  My grade:  A
0316666343|5.0|This was such a good book. I love the story it was very easy to get pulled into. I really liked the way that the author described the way the characters felt and how she explained things in their point of view. I would definitly recomend this book to any teenager.
0316921173|5.0|HERE'S SOME PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE: I read \\"Infinite Jest\\" a year ago.  It took me about 3 months, on and off.  I have a friend who took a year to read it.  An honest estimate, I believe, is about 50-70 hours of your times.  I think I took about 70 hours, but I'm a slow, patient reader. Read the footnotes-they're part of the story. You'll know when you can skim them.  And a note to Mr. Wallace: Some of those run-on sentences don't work.  You lose the reader.  I forgive you, however. <br /> <br />IT'S OKAY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ \\"INFINITE JEST.\\"  Here's the thing--this is a great book.  A really, really great book.  But it's really long, and it's just plain hard to read.  I've heard some people rant against the \\"illiterate populace\\" who aren't patient or intelligent enough to understand \\"Infinite Jest.\\" Hogwash.  It's just really, really big, and some people have other things to worry about, things like kids, jobs, social lives, and hygiene.  I happen to be encumbered with only the job, these days, so I was prepared to dig in.   <br /> <br />IF YOU'RE GOING TO READ \\"INFINITE JEST,\\" remember, Mr. Wallace is a post-modern author.  There's no set definition of post-modern, but with respect to Mr. Wallace, it means this doesn't read like a John Grishom novel with a straight plot line or a definite beginning, middle, and end.  The New York Times wrote a nasty review about \\"Infinite Jest\\" because of this.  After initially agreeing with that review, I sat around and thought about it, and I've changed my mind.   <br /> <br />As I said, it's not an easy read, especially when you start.  Once you get in the rhythm, it gets better and better.  You'll be rolling after the first 200 pages or so, but you have to suck it up until then.   <br /> <br />AND FINALLY, THIS BOOK IS FUNNY.  And it's creative.  There are wheelchair assassins and giant hamsters, and it's set in the future where the years are bought by corporations, so you get \\"The Year of the Depends Adult Undergarment,\\" or\\"The Year of the Trial Size Dove Bar.\\" There are three brothers, one with a giant arm, one with a giant leg, and the third with an enormous head.  You'll genuinely like them all when you're done.  It's about drug and alcohol abuse, corporations, politics, and society.  There are a million small stories through this book, and they're delightful.  You can read other reviews and figure out why everyone is so mad about the ending, but if you want to read Infinite Jest, don't spoil it.  Get mad, all by yourself. <br /> <br />ONE LAST THING: you are not God-on-the-throne if you finish this book.  You are not better than everyone else.  Please stop, it's embarrassing.  But you ran the literary equivalent of a marathon, so good on you.  Like me, it might open up new avenues of literature for you, and that's a good thing, too.
B000001EYW|5.0|Another great album from The Brothers Gibb. Their consistancy is amazing seeing that so many acts fade away after one or two albums. Even the greats seem to lose their magic once they get a little older. <br />Every song is true quality. Obviously 'Alone' was the big hit off this album and rightly so. The lads are on top form here. Instantly catchy and memorable. This is one of the best of the best from this album. <br />'I Could Not Love You More' was another single and a top 20 hit in the UK. A super ballad that makes the hairs on your neck stand up! Westlife and the like could learn a few lessons here! <br />This album, has a very urban feel to it. As black-music influnced Bee Gees Albums go this is up here with the R&B masterpiece 'Spirits Having Flown'. The very urban 'Closer Than Close' should have been the 2nd single off this album, as it is so catchy and would have been a big hit. Maybe because Maurice Gibb was on lead, it wasn't an option <br />Any way go to any song on the album and you'll be listening to a Gibb classic!
B0007GAEGC|2.0|I was listening to a pledge drive-rendition of this show in the background while working on the computer, and was all of a sudden rivted by the four-part a capella harmony on Bernstein's \\"Somewhere\\".  Wow!  Concert?  I will go!  I went to buy the recording, but that number is not present.  Huh?? I listened to the rest of the show, and I would say 75% of it is powerless elevator music.  Sigh.  I would spend much money to go listen for hours to these women sing spot-on harmony like that on Somewhere, despite the lack of open throat.  There was so much could have done here.  I just don't understand it.  Who picked this music?  Who picked what was to be included on the CD?
B000001FG5|5.0|When someone says the Bee Gees, most people conjure an image of a sparkling disco ball, flares, big collars, platforms, in essence DISCO! I feel sorry for these people. The Bee Gees were so much more then just Disco. Here, their talent as soulful R&B artists are showcased. <br />It was always going to be difficult to follow on the astronomical success of 'Saturday Night Fever'. But they somehow did it, a great testimant to the Brothers Gibb. <br /> Another 3 no.1s are notched up here, which is really remarkable. For me the only real Disco tune here is 'Tragedy'. An infectious song you cant get out of your head. It's more Abba Disco than Bee Gees Disco though! The best choice for a single but for me every other song on the album is better. <br />'Living Together' (which I think is fantastic) and 'Search, Find' may be considered Disco tunes to some, for me, there more up-beat R&B. 'Until' and 'Too much heaven' are masterful, soulful classics. 'Spirits (Having Flown)' doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album as it is very acoustic but its a classic, amazing. But for me the best, the coolest, the illest, the sickest, the funkiest, the sexiest track on here is 'Love You Inside Out'. It's been sampled by Snoop Dogg recently and I know why. That song is black as dirt my friend......!
1400031087|5.0|It's been a number of years since I've read a book as moving and brave as this. The book itself is simply a phenomenal accomplishment with an extraordinary range of emotion, sometimes comic and sometimes tragic -- although in the end uplifting. Frey's memoirs are harrowing, they constantly surprise us, and they are unsparing in the belief that one must take responsibility for one's life and actions. He has contempt for excuses, especially his own. He is unsparing, searching, and even angry about those who blame something or someone else for their troubles.<br /><br />The writing style is terse, direct, and perfectly tuned to the mood of the story. One device he uses throughout is repetition of phrases emphasis, perhaps conveying an addict's obsession. It also has the effect of tying it into epic oral literature such as Beowulf or the Iliad, with Frey tagging characters to phrases \\"her eyes blue Arctic eyes\\"or \\"his edge of violence, control and power\\" in the same way that Homer repeats \\"rosey-fingered\\" dawn or \\"clever\\" Odysseus. The book reads as fluidly as if it were spoken to you.<br /><br />One piece of IMPORTANT ADVICE: PLEASE DON'T read the back page before you get there! I made this mistake wondering if there was an index, and the last page tells the fate of those in the book. It's better to have this waiting for you at the end.<br /><br />On the down side there are a few incidents that don't seem to ring true (an incident with a priest in Paris is not quite plausible), and his conflicts with the AA program may also strike some as counterproductive for one in his condition. In balance this book is still a considerable accomplishment
B00000DLUV|5.0|This is a great live album showcasing just some the Bee Gees greatest hits! This albums gets 5 stars for a number of reasons. Firstly you get to hear live Bee Gees' versions of hits they wrote for other artists ('Heartbreaker' - Dionne Warwick', 'Islands In The Stream' - Kenny Rogers, 'Grease' - Frankie Valli, 'Guilty' - Barbra Streisand). <br />      Also there are different takes on songs here. 'Lonely Nights' is turned into a rock number while the memorable/eerie reunion with the late Andy Gibb sounds even more beautiful than the original. Also you get to hear from Maurice Gibb on, for me, one of the the group's slickest songs 'Closer Than Close'. <br />      All the Disco hits are here to get the crowd cronked up but the earlier hits are not forgotten ('How Can You Mend A Broken Heart) as well as new hits ('Alone'). Not even Celine Dion, whom I can't stand, can ruin this album.  <br />      These are not minus points but I would have prefered if Robin Gibb had perhaps sang 'Love Me' or 'I've Gotta Get A Message To You' instead of 'The Sun Will Shine'. It would have gotten a much bigger reaction from the audience. Finally while Barry's voice can become a little strained on the falsettos at times he's still great and Robin is in fantastic form here.
B00005JNJV|5.0|...and no wonder, it's directed by Christopher Nolan, who did the sensational \\"Memento\\" (2000) and almost-as-good \\"Insomnia.\\"  If you have never seen those movies you should, to understand just what this man was capable of before getting ensnared by the major American studios.  Definitely not your typical big-budget Hollywood cheeseball, Nolan has an original vision and style.<br /><br />What sets this film apart is the fact that it has a well-developed, well-written and believable psychological AND philosophical backstory, rather than being just another special effects and computer-animation orgy.<br /><br />With the exception of the inevitable \\"Batman saves the day at the last moment in dramatic showdown with the evil head honcho\\" final 10 minutes, it had me guessing most of the way through.  The weakest link as others have noted, was casting Katie Holmes, who is a cutie but has an acting range of maybe 3 rubber expressions (self-righteous, confused, scared).
B000001FAW|5.0|Far from jumping on the Disco band wagon, the Bee Gees first forays into the Diso Genre on 'Main Course' in 1975 was at a time when Disco was not that popular. <br />On 'Main Course' we got a little taster of what was coming from the Bee Gees, with  tracks like 'Nights On Broadway', 'Jive Talkin'' and 'Fanny Be Tender'. <br />This album is all about Disco and R&B. At this point in time, the lads Songwriting was so strong that any track here could have been a massive hit. <br />'You Should be Dancing' was the choice as single and was and still is a huge hit, reaching number 1 on the billboard charts. Funnily 'Love Me' somehow found it's way to Yvonne Elliman and was a big hit for her especially in the UK. If you ask me, her version is absolutely nothing to the original sung by Robin and Barry which should have been A no.1 <br />'Love So Right' was another big hit reaching no.3. A great soulful ballad from Barry. Boogie Child was also a minor hit. <br /> For me this is the quintessential disco album. A real must. Every song, a classic <br />White boys got soul too you know......even if they are from Manchester!
B00003CXCT|4.0|Before I asked for this as a birthday gift, I looked at the reviews on Amazon. I heard that there were lots of changes in the movies. I still asked for the DVD set. I don't watch the movies 24/7 unlike some people(ha-ha). If you don't watch the movies often(the older versions, ect), you won't notice anything. If you are a person that watches all 3 of the oringinal movies 1 once everyday, you will notice changes. However, there is a very big change that George Lucas made to Episode VI. The person that plays Anakin Skywalker now, Hayden Christan, replaces the other actor that played him in the end of the movie. These movies are still worth watching.
0060234814|4.0|Jeffrey Yip                                       Saturday, November 26, 2005 <br /> <br />A fascinating book...  <br /> <br />The book I chose to read I chose to read for this assignment is \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\", and the reason I chose it was that I have already read it's previous book in the series (The Magician's Nephew), therefore I chose to carry on with the series, as I find reading sequels one after another is a lot easier than reading independent books that I have no connection of. The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel.   This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up.  And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present. <br />
B000A7DVY0|5.0|The Big Lebowski is to my generation what The Rocky Horror Picture Show is to my parent's. While I haven't seen anybody acting out the Big Lebowski on stage while the movie plays behind I have been to midnight screenings complete with people dressed up as characters from the movie. That being said this movie is one of the classic you like and get or you don't. It seems that most female don't appreciate this movie as much as guys do (but I do know several women that do enjoy it).    The Big Lebowski takes place in Hollywood right before Operation Desert Storm. If there is a plot in this movie it would be the 'hero' Jeff Lebowski, aka The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is trying to replace his rug. You see the rug really tied his living room together. And some Chinaman peed on his rug. As the movie progresses we learn that The Dude was confused for a different Jeff Lebowski, who is not only a millionaire but married to a trophy wife who owes money all over town, and that the Chinaman meant to pee on the millionaire's rug. The Dude and his two friends; the hilariously bitter Vietnam Vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), and the soft spoken, strike rolling, Donny (Steve Buscemi) are thrown into a complicated kidnapping scheme involving Nihilists, 15 year old car thieves, porn kings, a feminist artists, and the Chief of Police of Malibu.     From crazy dreams to garden parties this movie is as good the 10th time as it is the 1st time you see. While this movie is hilariously funny, and incredibly quotable it must be noted that there is a lot of 'foul' language so make sure you watch it before you decide to let any impressionable children see it.
B000BB14YY|1.0|Updated 2012, September......this is for Blu Ray Edition from Studio Canal<br />If you are wondering if you should buy Criterion or this one, please avoid this crap. Just like \\"Deer Hunter\\", they used PAL audio source uncorrected,so what you hear is not in right pitch. I am familiar with each actor's voice, and none of them sounds right. You can notice the difference just to listen Toru Takemitsu's atmospheric sound track, if you could compare to Criterion version.  I waited to hear form Studio Canal for years, contacted to them by email, but no answer so far. Studio Canal dropped major ball, and they are not willing to fix this intolerable mistake. What a shame!<br /><br />This is for Criterion Version..........2006<br />I have just reviewed this disc, and as I anticipated, likewise \\"Kagemusha\\", this criterion version surpasses the quality and presentation to Japanese version.This Criterion version is the BEST ONE among any versions available of this landmark film in past, including my 15-years old LaserDisc, .<br /><br />The image quality looks more saturated, and shows more defined sharpness than Japanese Masterwork Edition from Toho.  The Criterion version has higher bit rate, since Japanese version carries too much on one disc (Feature film + documentary).  As the credit shows, the sauce was from French studio CANAL ( but don't worry, it is NOT PAL converted transfer. The picture is 24F progressive ) with French titles which is not in the Japanese version. The other major difference is that while Japanese disc has discreet 4-channel surround sound with 384kbps, Criterion version includes 2-Channel stereo with 448kbps. The difference is subtle, but I would raise the flag on Criterion for more aggressive, powerful sound.<br /><br />Also, it was very delightful for me to get \\"AK\\", an acclaimed making documentary as a supplement, and \\"Image\\" which was aired about 14 Years ago on Broadcast Satellite (now those ware individually available with... well, about $70 here).  \\"AK\\" in Toho Box Set is presented in 4:3 with 60f video frame rate, while the one in Criterion supplement is 16:9 with 24F progressive picture.<br /><br />$40 is a bit steep for double-dipping, but I don't feel any regret. I can not wait for their upcoming \\"The Bad Sleep Well\\", the most (criminally) underrated Kurosawa film.
B00000K3CK|5.0|The message of this film is just timeless almost sixty years on.  I don't think I would allow less than a mature child to view this film not because the issue of Santa Claus' existence is called to question here.  Rather, the sight of adults behaving badly during what should be the most joyous and festive of holidays may be traumatic.  Whether Santa Claus exists is not the real focus here but the cynicism and commercialism of Christmas by those who should know better is.  The message is delivered subtlely by director-scriptwriter George Seaton.  Despite a happy ending this is strong stuff particularly for 1947 when Hollywood served up feel-good entertainment.  Edmund Gwenn, in one of those rare happenstances, was born to play Kris Kringle.  His mirth and good humor just envelope the screen.  Young Natalie Wood is a joy as young Susan, a child discouraged from believing in the fanciful.  Wood is just so natural and unaffected on the screen.  Amusing bit part here by Jack Albertson as a postal employee.
B000002I2I|5.0|Although the Doors fourth album \\"The Soft Parade\\" (1969) had sold well and produced the smash hit \\"Touch Me,\\" both fans and critics alike felt as though the band sold out. Compared to \\"The Doors\\" and \\"Strange Days\\" (both 1967) the band's more recent work had been viewed as overtly commercial. In the eyes of the Doors faithful, both \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" (1968) and \\"The Soft Parade\\" seemed to pale in comparison to the Doors first two albums. \\"The Soft Parade\\" in particular, with its strings and pop compositions, seemed to rub Doors fans and critics the wrong way. The negative feedback, however, ultimately worked to the Doors advantage. In response to the negative buzz, the Doors released what would ultimately be hailed as one of their finest albums \\"Morrison Hotel\\" (1970).<br /><br />\\"Morrison Hotel\\" is neither a return to the sound of the Doors early albums nor is it a follow-up to the styling of its immediate predecessor \\"The Soft Parade.\\" Rather, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" opens a new chapter in the Doors history all together. Gone were the psychedelic trimmings of the first two albums. Gone was the commercialism of the last two. \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is distinctly stripped down, and edgier. It was akin to what Credence Clearwater Revival were doing at the time. All in all, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is an album of unadulterated, meat-and-potatoes, no-nonsense, blues-tinged, rock n' roll.<br /><br />Although \\"Morrison Hotel\\" embraces a new sound, all the elements of the Doors are firmly in place; Jim Morrison's soulful baritone, John Densmore's jazzy percussion, Robbie Krieger's bluesy guitar, all the while peppered with Ray Manzarek's wholly unique signature organ and piano. So while \\"Morrison Hotel\\" sees the Doors exploring new ground, they do so in a way that doesn't forget what made the Doors, the Doors.<br /><br />Some of Morrison's best poetry is on \\"Morrison Hotel.\\" While all his work is good, with \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" he was just starting to blossom as a writer and was becoming more refined.<br /><br />In some respects, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is a precursor or sister album to its more renowned follow-up, \\"LA Woman\\" (1971). Both albums are cut from the same cloth in the sense that they are both blues-tinged hard-rock, but \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" while hardly cheerful, is distinctly less dark, perhaps because the listener knows that Morrison's death is not imminent.<br /><br />The straight-forward \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" was the most rocking song the Doors recorded since \\"Break on though (to the other Side) from the Doors debut. John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful (though not credited by name) adds the perfect touch of harmonica to give the song a gritty edge. \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" which was originally penned for the album by that name, begins slowly and serene, with an underlining pressure slowly building up beneath the surface, as forceful keyboards pierce their way though from time to time. Then, as the chorus sets in, the song yields to Morrison, demanding to know \\"what went wrong.\\" The upbeat \\"You Make Me Real,\\" while not bad, lacks the grit of the rest of \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" and is not one of the albums better songs. The highly underrated melodic \\"Peace Fog\\" gets the album back on track and features one of Krieger's best solos. The serene \\"Blue Sunday\\" is simply enchanting, and Morrison had never given a more soulful delivery (although by now his voice was not what it had been). Cut from the same cloth, the jazzy \\"Ship of Fools\\" and the bluesier \\"Land Ho!\\" acts effectively as a semi-medley. On the low-key, serene, \\"The Spy,\\" one really believes that Morrison is omni-present, as he states he is. The easygoing \\"Queen of the Highway\\" follows nicely, keeping up the momentum. \\"Indian Summer\\" is simply one of the most beautiful Doors compositions ever. More than just another balled, Morrison never sounded so vulnerable or sincere. Though Morrison's voice is nearly shot for the closing \\"Maggie Mc'Gill,\\" this bluesy rocker makes for a good finale.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Morrison and the band as a whole, by the recording of \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" Morrison's heavy drinking and drugs were beginning to take a toll on his voice. While his voice isn't a ghost of its former glory as it is in the follow-up \\"LA Woman,\\" Morrison does sound strained.<br /><br />Upon its release, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" was greeted with a warm reception among fans and critics alike, and the album was praised as the groups' best work since \\"Strange Days.\\" While \\"Morrison Hotel\\" is held in high regard today, it is unfortunately sometimes overlooked due to the fact that fans and critics alike tend to cite the Doors first two albums, and Morrison's swan song, \\"LA Woman\\" as the bands best work. And while \\"Morrison Hotel\\" boasts such classics as \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" and \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" many other songs like \\"Indian Summer\\" and \\"The Spy\\" are overlooked and remain lost treasures.<br /><br />Some critics will tell you only die-hard fans need to buy the Doors studio albums and that the casual fan is best served sticking to a \\"best of\\" CD. If you are on a budget, sure, otherwise, go ahead and buy all six classic Doors albums. While a hits album is good, each Doors album has its own unique flavor and flow, and one is best served experiencing the album as a whole, rather than just getting the highlights from a \\"greatest hits\\" or a \\"best of.\\" If you followed the advice of critics who will tell you \\"all you need is a `best of'\\" you'd miss out in many of their best songs, like the aforementioned \\"Indian Summer\\" and \\"The Spy.\\"br /> <br />Unfortunately for Morrison and the band as a whole, by the recording of \\"Morrison Hotel,\\" Morrison's heavy drinking and drugs were beginning to take a toll on his voice.

B000AGTPUK|4.0|For maybe the first half of \\"The Polar Express\\" I was ready to dismiss it as a film more concerned with visual effects at the expense of good storytelling and character developement.  Not exactly a lump of coal but a disappointment considering the talent involved(Robert Zemeckis, Tom Hanks).  Once the train  reached it's destination, the North Pole, is when the film for me began to gel.  It is at this juncture of the film where the characters, CGI though they may be, develope identities and you start to empathize with them.  The film's message of believing in the spirit of Christmas was palpable and not some cynical catchphrase.  What accounts for the film's split personality?  My guess is that in fleshing out a thin illustrated children's book to feature length the filmmakers didn't have enough material so they compensated with visual fluorishes.  On the whole this is a nice picture that falls short of being a great film.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is simply the best movie you are ever likely to see if you have ever decided to take one path and not another in life.<br /><br />The fact that a movie that consists of two people talking for a few hours can bring tears to your eyes (it did to mine) and can make you think about your life is amazing. Couple that with excellent acting and with a Julie Delpy that you cannot help to fall in love with, and you have a movie that should have won 100 Oscars.<br /><br />In one word: epiphanic.
B0000TB050|4.0|I haven't been to a U2 concert before and it seems like the band doesn't have any plans on stopping by the Philippines any time soon, so, the closest thing I could get to seeing them LIVE would be through their commercial DVD releases. Although the Boston DVD have its moments (live performances of \\"Gone\\", \\"Stay\\" and \\"The Fly\\" were the most notable) the Slane DVD is far superior to its predecessor for several obvious reasons: the anamorphic widescreen and DTS audio really captures the band at its best Elevation Tour ever caught on film. The set list really works better with the inclusion of \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Staring At The Sun\\", \\"Pride\\" and \\"One\\". The band's chemistry, constant humor, the sad \\"Kite\\" tribute to Bono's dad (who recently died before the first Slane gig) and a fantastic audience made this DVD a classic and definitely a must-have.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|I've never been a country fan and I'm still not. But Shania, as we all know, is crossover so I can agree with this. The beginning is strong with the newer stuff. Then in the middle it gets to the more country stuff. So if you like both country and pop, you'll be happy with this part. Then, the end's new songs are great. Both versions of \\"Party For Two\\" are great as well as \\"Don't\\" and the one country song I've EVER liked \\"I Ain't No Quitter\\" is even good. <br /> <br />Highlights:  <br /> <br />Forever And For Always <br />I'm Gonna Getcha Good <br />That Don't Impress Me Much <br />Party For Two (Both versions)
0804106304|5.0|This book was written when I was in high school.  I heard quite a bit about it, but didn't read it at the time, and I eventually saw the movie. <br />When I did read it, I thought it was beautiful.  The first page in itself fills you with emotion when faced with the practicality of good intentions.  The book begins with the good intentions of a mother arriving in the United States from China.  It ends with a daughter returning to China from the US  to share the good intentions of her mother after she has passed away.  In the middle is good storytelling.

B000000I02|5.0|This is probably the most uniformly brilliant and inventive piece of canterburian progressive rock I have ever heard. Every single composition displays extremely intricate arrangement, chord patterns, and amazing virtuosic musicianship. Dave Stewart's keyboard work is absolutely indespensable and the whole band displays some of the most melodic and confoundingly beautiful ensemble work this side of Mozart. Not only does the music improve but it is essential for repeated listening. This is a defining statement not just for canterbury sound but for progressive rock as a whole. One of the most accomplished works of the whole genre!
0767802470|3.0|As the review title says; worth a look, but unfortunately, it, like it's sister movie, \\"Stalingrad\\", is a bit heavy-handed in wanting to evoke sympathy for the German side of the story, all the while adding to the revisionist \\"Good German Myth\\", that's been around for decades. <br /> <br />  Not surprisingly, every possible anti-Nazi scenario/cliche takes place in both movies. <br /> <br />  But Das Boot is worth a look if for no reason as it's a good portrayal of sub operations, overall.
B00001ODHJ|5.0|THIS VERSION IS THE BEST. I recommend this copy of Army of Darkness. The most recent release of this movie only has the movie itself, and it is more expensive. This copy, a few years older, has more special features. + THIS IS A VERY FUN MOVIE! <br />SINCERELY <br />-CHUCKY-
1558216847|5.0|The chronicle of the amazing journey of a Polish officer, unjustly sent to the gulag by the Russians, and of 6 companions, one a wonderful girl. He writes very well, and describes the characters and event extremely well. <br /> <br />The book reads like a thriller, yet is also a most interesting account of a time and of places, some now gone, some still pretty much the same.  <br /> <br />You can get an outline of the story from other comments, as well as from the list of contents, so I will not repeat the story, but wish to make some comments.  <br /> <br />Some previous reviewers questioned some aspects of the veracity of the story, including the friendship with the commandants wife. Having heard from several others in similar circumstances in Russian and German camps, I find the story credible. <br /> <br />There has also been questions raised about the feasibility of trekking in the Himalayas without crampons. I have just been trekking in the Himalayas with no equipment save for sneakers, and am not even super fit. It is not all rock climbing,nor is it all ice covered - there are tracks of various steepness, and at various heights. Funnily enough, many of the Himalayan peaks do not even look terribly high - the valleys are so high that in places the mountains look like high hills. So that is credible, too. <br /> <br />What I did find very difficult to believe is his account of how they crossed the desert, without even having water for days on end. I had thought that was impossible, however since the rest of his story is credible, and the bits I have knowledge abotu accurate, I will have to accept that what he described is true. <br /> <br />It is a rollicking yarn, and much recommended for its historical details, for its description of personalities and places, for talking about the friendliness and helpfulness and way of life of people living in dirt poor areas, who have nothing, and as a testament to the human spirit.
0446677450|3.0|Kiyosaki is a successful investor and a trained salesman. In this case, he sells ideas about the differences between the poor, the middle class, and the rich. If you expect this book to provide you with the nuts and bolts of becoming rich, look elsewhere. The book is primarily a motivational book that describes the attitudes of people towards money, and explains why a play-it-safe attitude prevents people to become rich. As is the case with most motivational books, there is ample padding. The book is about 200 pages, but its information was worth perhaps 30 pages. <br /> <br />A main concept of the book is to define liabilities and assets, the difference being that assets generate money (positive cash flow), whereas liabilities cost money. The main idea is as follows: Poor and middle class people buy liabilities from their paychecks, and from that point on, they have little if any left for investment. The rich first commit money towards assets, generate positive cash flow from these investments, some of which is reinvested, and some of which can be used for buying liabilities and consumer items.  <br /> <br />The idea is simple and not exactly new. Although the book is highly repetitious, filled with rambling, and poorly written, Kiyosaki as a highly trained salesman managed to package the age-old idea in such an appealing way that it became a national bestseller. He admits in the book that he is a bestselling author, and not a best writing one. Indeed, the difference is clear. The validity of the ideas communicated by the book is made credible by Kiyosaki's personal success as an investor. He gives numerous examples of how he made money.  <br /> <br />The \\"trick\\" is to find something that is underpriced, and then sell it at its real market value. Kiyosaki does not hide that doing that takes a lot of training, learning, and personal experience. He also admits that out of ten deals, he loses money on two our three, breaks even on half of them, and hits the jackpot ontwo or three. Again, the \\"trick\\" is that one must manage the risk instead of avoiding it or taking risks foolishly, meaning that the losses are minimal, whereas the jackpots are way larger than the losses. What must not be overlooked is the fact that a very experienced and successful investor like Kiyosaki wins only on 20 to 30% of his investments.  <br /> <br />What Kiyosaki does not teach in this book is how one finds and identifies a good investment. Without it, the idea cannot be put into action, and, in that regard, the book is useless. But isn't the idea that you will buy his next book hoping to find the answer to that question? That's excellent salesmanship!  <br /> <br />To be fair, the book contains some key ideas that are worth exploring, and especially teaching to children. That would be the most beneficial aspect of the book, and could help our children to avoid some of the traps of consumerism, squandering their money, and motivate them to invest first from an early age. What the parents need to realize is that children learn mostly from example, and the parents' spending habits may send the wrong signal. It is important that children are made aware of savings and investment habits as well - something that is less obvious in the everyday setting.  <br /> <br />The hypocrisy in the book is that it is portraying itself as a socially conscious teaching. In fact, if everyone would follow the ideas presented in the book, the idea would not work. The basis of success is that less than 10% will do it, and will essentially take advantage of the rest. Although it is never declared as an intent, yet, it is lurking between the lines. One may find these aspects morally disturbing. However, one may also accept that the book describes reality, and one feels resentment about being taken advantage of, and moral dilemma about wanting to become rich by taking advantage of others. <br /> <br />In summary, the book takes a new spin on old ideas, and in spite of its less than literary qualities, it works well as a motivational book.

B000AM6MKU|3.0|Ok kids, if a stranger in a vehicle pulls up next to you and offers you a ride to the North Pole...DO NOT GET ON!<br /><br />That was my first problem with this movie. All of the kids who got on the train used poor judgment. But it's only a movie right? Ok. I thought a lot of the movie looked more creepy than cheerful. The North Pole is an industrial wasteland. The elves are pretty creepy and Santa seems more mean than jolly.<br /><br />The visuals are pretty but the animators ran into trouble with the eyes and mouths of the characters. The eyes looked dead and the mouths were stiff.<br /><br />And did anybody else find the Jewish elf amusing? It seemed kind of out of place in a Christmas movie. But notably, this movie had nothing at all to do with Christ.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|For those of you who like to think when you listen to albums, keep buying Death Cab albums.  I haven't yet decided whether this first DCFC foray out into the world of major record labels is sheer genius or merely good music.  Musically, every song on this album is quite good.  \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed,\\" \\"Crooked Teeth,\\" \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan,\\" \\"Soul Meets Body,\\" . . . ok I'll just name every song.  Seriously, if there's a weak spot, it's the last cut on the album.  The intrigue of the album is the Camus-like opining about love and death throughout the songs.  Case in point: \\"Crooked teeth,\\" \\"I will follow you into the dark\\" \\"what Sarah said.\\" As a Catholic, I find \\"I will follow you into the dark\\" as insightful as it is painful to hear.  In any event, just like five or six of the other songs on the album, \\"I will follow you\\" is direct, artfully written, very original in its presentation; probably my favorite cut, even though it periodically makes me cringe.  This album has alot to say about what it means to love someone in the face of that person's impending demise.  It is either a very philosophically driven piece of art, or it is simply emotionally well articulated.  Either way, it's still a great follow up to Transatlanticism, The Photo Album and the Postal Service cuts.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have been a Madonna fan for a long time. She has proven time and time again to be one of the greatest artists ever! I was very exited to get this album, and I got it the day of its release. I was not disappointed! All of the songs are amazing, and they all make me want to dance. My favorite songs on the disc are Hung Up, Sorry, and Push, but they are all amazing. I find myself listening to this album over and over, and the songs remain in my head all day! The entire CD is very catchy and up-beat, and guaranteed to make anyone who listens to it happy. <br />  <br />It is not surprising that this album is shooting up to number one all over the world, and honestly, Madonna deserves it! Go out and buy it right now! I promise you won't regret it! <br /> <br />NOTE: Many of the reviews for this album seem to have gotten off topic. I don't think it was intended for amazon to be used to compare two different artists. This feature is simply for people to give their thoughts on the album! Please grow up! Thank you for reading my review!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Well, most of the other people have already said what is really to be said about this, im just going to throw in my comentary.  <br /> <br />I like this album, it makes me remember why i liked Toxicity so much, even though its very different. It also makes me remember why i got so turned off from them after Steal this Album!, cause i really couldn't stand that one (except for Theatawaves).  <br /> <br />All in all its good, but this album really focuses too much on Serj and Doran, and Shavo and John's contributions are slightly buried in the mix. The mix is very much just guitar Vocals and cymbals. Its very difficult to hear the Bass or the Bass drums, which is a shame because John and Shavo are fantastic players. I think thats one of the examples that while SOAD wouldn't be SOAD without Doran, he has a bit too much of a controlling say in the band and the production.  <br /> <br />Same goes for the actual lyrics, cause i honestly think that Doran may sing more than Serj on this album...Which is werid...considering that Serj is the lead singer...yeah... <br /> <br />It seems that with this album, SOAD progresses with their sound, but also displays that it really is just Doran's band
B00005JNJV|1.0|This is a rewrite of my 'Batman Begins' review, which i just wanted to make shorter and more to the point-    ****    Don't believe all the exaggerated publicity regarding this movie.     This has to be one of the most over-rated films i've ever seen.     Yes, the movie has a big quality to it - it is over-produced and heavy-handed. Watching it was a real drag. Just because a movie has a big feel and look to it, doesn't mean its great.    Anyway, to me 'Batman Begins' was a tiresome waste of time and as phony as Batman's hoarse voice. (sounds like in the movie he may have a cold - so instead of pop corn, you may want to have a few cough drops on hand if you decide to watch this).    but i would skip this one.    peace out & cheers!      -CrowTurtle
B000000OQF|5.0|No, this album needs no praise. If you don't know what this album holds then go listen to some N'SYNC or something, cuz you ain't got a clue. Hit after hit, this was probably the biggest rock record ever, next to say The Beatles and Zeppelin.  Lets look at it like this, GUNS put out one full length album in the eighties, one. APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, and with this album, they ruled the world. Nowadays you are likely to hear 90% of this thing on the radio WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, ITS SO EASY, MR BROWNSTONE, PARADISE CITY. Lets not forget SWEET CHILD O MINE which got the girls listening to rock and roll again, MY MICHELLE... whats that six? Six radio giants. And I haven't even mentioned the best tracks. NIGHTRAIN(I've always felt that this was MY song) and ROCKET QUEEN (screwing older women- nice.) God DAMN! These guys were really friggin good! Nothing more than a slice of history now, but if you ain't never heard this, pick it up, its a HELL RIDE!
0765309408|5.0|On his 75th birthday John Perry joins the Colonial Marines.  Why they would want Earth's old people for an army is something of a mystery to the people of earth.  None of the aged volunteers ever return to earth to provide an answer and none of the people on earth have any idea of what the colonies are like - except that they have much more advanced technology than earth does. <br /> <br />This novel provides well rounded characters, who once they get out into space, despite their long lives on Earth, finally realise how little they know. And they are needed by the colonies.  The universe is not always a friendly place and the skills they learn in the army are more needed than they know. <br /> <br />This is what could be described as \\"hard SF\\" but its well written, and driven by characters and not \\"Gee whiz\\" technology and the nice balance of the Gee Whiz and characters make this a memorable and enjoyable novel and makes me look forward to the next book set in this universe THE GHOST BRIGADES <br />
B000AARKOO|2.0|I rented this movie with high hopes because I love epics and Ridley Scott usually doesn't steer me wrong. However, I was severely let down for several reasons (this review contains SPOILERS): <br /> <br />1. We are expected to believe that Orlando Bloom's character, a blacksmith with no prior fighting experience, receives quite literally 5 minutes of swordfighting lessons from Liam Neeson, and then becomes an expert. And I actually mean five minutes -- that's all the time that elapses before some men come to arrest Orlando and Liam gets fatally wounded. <br /> <br />2. Orlando Bloom is NOT an appealing main character. He may have been alright in Lord of the Rings, but then again he wasn't the star. Bloom clearly thinks he's an action star, and the sad truth is that he's not. He's a scrawny, unappealing wuss that looks too much like a girl to be believable as a medieval knight. All I know is that the audience shouldn't want the main character to die, which is how I felt much of the movie. <br /> <br />3. The characters, though living during the time of the third crusade, have 21st-century concepts of the world. Bloom's character gives a speech about how people of all races need to unite and fight together, a concept that would have been laughable back then. Neeson plays a knight who is remorseful over the \\"murders\\" he believes he has committed, which is clearly part of the filmmakers' agendas to demonize the Christian knights who fought in the crusades. The problem I have with this is its historical inaccuracy, since the knights of that period believed that participation in the crusades was important to their salvation. <br /> <br />4. Ridiculous scenes that just made me laugh out loud. Like a scene where Bloom is helping the common people set up an irrigation system in the farmland he has just inherited. Not only is it laughable to think of a feudal landowner of that period actually doing back-breaking labor with the serfs (I don't care how moral you are, you *wouldn't* be doing manual labor if you were a lord back then), but it's pretty dumb to assume that these people, who've lived in an arid, desert environment their entire lives, wouldn't know how to get water from the ground until Orlando Bloom showed up. Then there was the scene where Orlando Bloom is chiding the knights about going into the desert to fight Saladin, the Muslim leader. As if a blacksmith would know how to fight an army and professional warriors wouldn't know the first thing. <br /> <br />5. The good guys are unbelieveably good and if the bad guys were any more evil, they'd be devouring babies on hoagie rolls. It's the sign of a weak screenwriter (and director, for that matter) when you are incapable of characterizing your creations realistically, and you must resort to basically telling the audience, \\"Okay, this guy's evil because he wants to kill babies, and this guy's good because he wants everbody to love each other.\\" The crusades were a morally ambiguous time, and it would have been nice to see a movie that doesn't condescend to its audience and lets them decide who's good and who's evil. <br /> <br />Those are my complaints. On the plus side, the movie did have Liam Neeson, as well as the severely underrated and underused David Thewlis. <br /> <br />
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I never thought I would ever find myself using the term \\"Disheartening\\" to describe Enya's work. I have been a near obsessed fan for as many years as I am old just about. I have all ofher imports, her box-sets, her VHS and DVD's... and, unlike any other artist who decides to make we wait between 5-8 painstaking years for something new- I always found it was worth the wait. <br /> <br /> Until Amarantine. I cannot even begin to express my extreme disappointment in this Album. It's apparentfrom reading other reviews, I am not alone in this. I don't want people to forget that Enya actually consists of three people... Enya herself, the vocalist and instrumentalist, Nicky Ryan, the producer, and Roma Ryan, the poet and lyracist.  <br /> <br /> It should be apparent to everyone that the problem with this latest work is *not* Enya herself. If anything her voice is the heavenly powerhouse it always has been, andher English has improved tremendously. No longer should we Enya fans have to translate for our friends who sit stumped over the words. The words that Roma Ryan weaves still conjur up majestic images and longing emotions that spin tales leaving us breathless. She is a lyrical genius. The problem is Nicky Ryan, who seems no longer capable of challenging Enya herself, musically. In fact, with Amarantine, we here her in various themes influenced by their previous outing, \\"A Day WIthout Rain,\\" specifically threads of their worldwide smash, \\"Only Time.\\" Perhaps Nicky was hoping to mimic that success, unfortunately it fell entirely short of even modest Enya fans. <br /> <br /> What wrong with this Album? Thetracks seem simply exploitive of Rnya herself. They could be crap and we'd still purchase it. \\"Long, Long, Journey\\" is far to reminiscent of a child's tune, like London Bridge Is Falling down... with the traditional, Enya-esque Ooh's and Ahh's thrown in for continuity. \\"It's In The Rain\\" has lovely lyrics (Typical of Roma) but he theme to which it's set diminishes it's potential beyond redemption. Of course, you will hear threads of their first outing, \\"The Celts.\\"  <br /> <br /> \\"Sumiregusa\\" a japanese inspired song was released actually last summer and used in a panasonic commercial. While it's etheral quality and overall beauty got fans all over the globe excited about the forthcoming album, it was overwhelmingly sad to see it included on the album, for one would presume, with over 5 years between the last album and this one, more tracks could have been completed and ready for inclusion. \\"Sumiregusa\\" and the reaction to it must have made them think we would have liked to have heard it on the album, instead of as a single- which was even made available on Enya's website long before the release. <br /> <br /> \\"Amarantine\\" isnot without it's small gems though. The two best tracks on this Album are \\"Someone Said Good-Bye\\" and \\"Water shows the Hidden Heart\\" both of whish sshowcase Enya's vocal capability and Roma's lyrical savvy. Aside from that, nothing on this album will have you singing along, nothing echoes the Enya quality to which we have grown accustomed to, and finally, nothing is remotely as memorable as any of the track on her previous albums. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most frustrating fact is while most of us die-hard fans accept the extraordinary amount of time between albums (So much time that most other musicians complete 2 or 3 albums.) but what is hard to accept that after the sour reception of this stinker we'll have to wait until 2010 before we get to see if this is just a blooper, or in indeed, the quality of Nicky's production skills are going downhill. <br /> <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a corporate tool.  I bought this album for the sole reason that Amazon named it the top album of 2005.  I've been aching to find something new and interesting (my Flogging Molly and Phillip Glass albums were getting worn out).  Since I hadn't seen anyone named Sufjan on American Idol, and the album wasn't getting shoved down the throats of us consumers I thought that Amazon may be trying to make a statement for the betterment of music. <br /> <br />Thank Goodness!! <br /> <br />I played it first when leaving town for a 20 hour Thankgiving round trip, I didn't know that it would be the only thing played on the radio the whole trip.  While previous review rant about the first couple of tracks, I think they bouced over the truely great tracks.  I found \\"The Predatory Wasp Of The Palisades Is Out To Get Us!\\" as a beautifully contradiction on itself.  I told a friend about htis track, and he was shocked I used terms like innocent & lovely on something named after a bug.  I love the way \\"The Man Of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts\\" transitions between tempos.  But my favorite track is by far \\"Cashmir Pulaski Day\\".  When I fully understood what Cashmir Pulasky Day was about, I was bought to tears. <br /> <br />Most of the time, music shoved at us doesn't deserve our well earned money.  This album is worth a listen.  This artist deserves our support.  This 50 state concept is a pipedream, but I am glad there are still dreamers in the music industry and if this is the result of dreams then I will keep buying.
B00009YOQW|5.0|We love this drum! It has a nice sound to it and is easy for little hands to grasp. We've had it for almost a year now and no problems with the design, perhaps the other reviewer got a bad one? Highly recommended for your little musician!
B000B0WODA|5.0|This Cd was better than their first album... Can you imagine that? Best Songs: I'm your villain, Well that was easy, The fallen, This boy
B00005LC1H|5.0|This series is exceedingly hard to watch. Hard - because it's almost impossible to get past watching the first episode. That alone is a satisfying banquet that you will want to repeat over and over, wiithout going further to sample the rest. Having finally done that, it's difficult to pick a favorite episode, and it's arguable that any single one in the collection is, alone, worth the price of the whole.  <br /> <br />In the first episode alone, we're treated to some brilliant, classic (and nearly indescribable) situations: \\"On Those Trays (Burro! Hee-haw!)\\" and \\"Throw - It - AWAY!\\" (It's difficult to write this, without cracking up.) The slapstick is tastefully done. I don't know if it's true or not, but it gives the impression of being cleverly improvised on the spot, rather than slickly planned and rehearsed. Cleese and Company should be very proud indeed.  <br /> <br />After a bad day, this DVD never fails to cheer me up. It's an essential, essential addition to any DVD collection.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I like Foo Fighters, but i detest this cd. 2 cds of... i don't know what it is exaclty, but it's not good.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Some people might say, this isn't worth buying as the songs are on other albums (eg, Please Please Me, Let It Be), but this a great way to start getting intrested in The Beatles. Sure it may not have good tracks like I Am The Walrus, but it still is worth getting. This album got me intrested in The Beatles. <br /> <br />A must get album. <br /> <br />Jake Potts
B00005JO1P|2.0|A good biography is hard to make. Here are some of the things I didn't like about this movie.  <br />1- Struggle between man and woman relationship. This movie comprised too much of Reese Witherspoon's character. I would have preferred the focus remain on his music and the birth of his fame and events to follow.  <br />2- I would have liked if the movie went beyond the 60's and looked at him in the 1980's and so forth. <br />3- I didn't think the father and son relationship was focused enough on and why did Johnny Cash not better defend himself against a heartless dad? His dad was not a good dad but he is not even in the middle of the picture, not until the end.  <br />4- Reese Witherspoon , though a good actor, has become rather dull in her approach to acting and quite predictable. I was getting annoyed with her about mid way thru the script.  <br />Sorry, but this movie isn't as good as those who \\" walk the line\\" say it is. Thanks.
B000021YQV|5.0|this cd was phenominal! it was the first cd i got of soad and now i have all of them. It is hard to top their first cd they put out but they did. My favorite songs are Prison Song Needles Deer Dance Jet Piolet X Chop Suey! Bounce Forest Atwa Science Shimmy Toxicity Psycho and Ariels. If you notice, that is every single song on the album. I just thought it was that good. <br /> <br />Prison Song- This was one of their more political songs. Very fast, and shows Serjs talented voice in it. I loved this song! 10/10 <br /> <br />Needles- WHAT AN AMAZING SONG! I loved the part when daron sang his part. That was funny and random. One of their best songs they've made-10/10 <br /> <br />Deer Dance- Another political song and very good. Very heavy and just overall good. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Jet Piolet- This song is pretty good but not thier best. I still loved it. Its super fast and an interesting song. 8/10 <br /> <br />X- Another political song and fast again. Kinda like Jet Piolet but Shorter. Would be higher if a little longer. 8/10 <br /> <br />Chop Suey- JUSt an amazing song. I love how it is so fast paced and the fast singing. I dont really get why it is called chop suey though. 10/10 <br /> <br />Bounce- Fun song and i love the beat. The beginngin of it is just the best! 9/10 <br /> <br />Forest- Awsome song! I love it and it is one of their scarier songs.  10/10 <br /> <br />Atwa- A slower song of theirs but still good. Its not their best but still okay. 8/10 <br /> <br />Science- Pretty good song and its abou thow science has failed our world? I think thats what it is about. 9/10 <br /> <br />Shimmy- This is an awsome song and funny also. If only it was longer would it be a 10. 9/10 <br /> <br />Toxicity- I love the drumming in this. It is so fast and it shows off Johns drumming skill. One of my favorites on the cd. 10/10 <br /> <br />Psycho- VERY GOOD SONG. I love this song and theres not much more to say about it. <br /> <br />Ariels- Good song and one of their best on the cd. I love the part at the end, Argo. Its jsut fun and funny to listen  to. 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001BS4Q0|3.0|The entire CD is average, the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of 1 amazing song.  Breathe me. That song alone made it worth the buy though. Great song, on a sub-par CD.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|At the time that I am writing this, there are 784 reviews of the album and it is less than two weeks from the release of the album. So I dont think any more are needed or will even have a chance to get read. If ever an album deserved 5 stars this is it. So this is my contribution to propping up ratings for Madonna. <br /> <br />Apart from the brilliant Hung Up based on the \\"Gimme Gimme Gimme\\" sample that everyone has heard already, my favorites are \\"Like It Or Not\\", \\"How High\\", \\"Future Lovers\\" that seems to sample the Donna Summer beat from \\"I Feel Love\\" and \\"Jump\\".  <br /> <br />The songs I liked least are \\"Isaac\\" because of the chant and \\"I Love New York\\" because the puerile lyrics that I could gather as \\"I Like New York, Other places make me feel like a Dork\\". I read some good reviews of the song at this site and the deeper meaning people are reading into the song (as the \\"*&! Off\\" in the lyrics being intended at George Bush). I still cannot seem to like this song. \\"Isaac\\" is growing on me though.  <br /> <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album aimed to please and it landed right on target. A definate must-have for anyone who enjoys great music. I have enjoyed everything shes dropped. She has proven herself over and over again as well as now. <br /> <br />Also I'm a Mariah Carey fan and I think it is VERY immature to compare the both of them. They are both great musicians and I'm sure neither would agree to what you all are doing. It's unfair to the both of them. You should all be ashamed of yourselves, for you can not be a true fan of someone if you can't respect their compitition. If one is doing better than the other, it it because it is deserved. Don't be foolish, grow up, and find something better to do with your time.  <br /> <br />Please just review the cd, that is what this is for. No More, No Less.
B000069D4M|5.0|I hope this makes it to DVD. This is simply the most beautiful production of The Nutcracker I have ever seen. The costumes are so splendid and the dancing is second to none. This is worth the watch. It is my favorite.
B00006IRJU|5.0|I have listened to this band since I was in my early twenties, and this album always had a special place in my heart. The melodies, the lyrics, even today, decades later, still touch me and bring me right back to my own youth. I love the songs, I love especially the song \\"Man of Colors\\"..its absolutely beautiful, as are so many other tracks.  This is a must have dvd.  Go get your copy and see why. <br /> <br />Annie, USA, 2005
B00004Y7SF|3.0|If you're a fan of Christna I would suggest that you buy this album, but if you are a fan you have most likely already done so. The best tracks here are Merry Christmas Baby, These Are The Special Times (which is a modern classic), and The Christmas Song. I really love these songs and would buy this album again just to have them but with iTunes and Napster you can buy these songs individually and save some bucks. <br /> <br />This album was rushed as most Christmas albums were during this time in Popdom, the new songs are silly and lame and the classics are overexaggerated (for the most part).  <br /> <br />During this time in Christina's career she was desperately trying to prove that she could sing, hoping that this fact would seperate her from the Britney's of the time. This isn't my favorite christmas album.
B00006AW2M|3.0|A friend gave me Satanic on a CD the other day. Its been over 25 years since I last listened to this one. Despite the not-so- surprising \\"freshness\\" that any CD would have after this amount of time, its not a bad record/CD after all. Forget about their attempt to copy the Beatles, what I like is that the Stones were venturing off into new territory.- surely something that they have not done for some time. Some of the tracks are weird or throwaways, or both (I am thinking of the reprise to Sing This All Together), but others really move. I am thinking of 2000 Light Years (I saw the Stones play this in the late 1980s and it really kicked a$%), 2000 Man, and Citadel, among others. Give it a listen and skip the stuff that irritates you. It captures the era quite well, and its not bad. <br />
B0000714B5|5.0|Siddhartha is a powerful movie. It is focused on one individual's spiritual journey through life. It is a story about illumination of self-discovery, learning the lessons and meaning of life through our individual experiences. It is a journey that teaches us the importance of finding, as contrary to simply seeking. After seeing it we can truly obtain wisdom and understanding of life.
0525948023|4.0|There are many excellent reviews elsewhere. This is a suggestion. Perhaps Mr. Tolle would benefit from an editor. A competent editor could smooth out Eckhart's writing and eliminate some of those \\"which is to say\\", \\"in other words\\", \\"that is to say\\", \\"as it were\\", \\"strictly speaking\\", \\"one goes so far to say\\", \\"which means\\", \\"we could even say\\", etc. A good editor could make some of the writing less amateurish. Perhaps Mr. Tolle is not ready to have someone alter the words of the \\"Master\\". Has he become enamored with his own musings?
0590353403|5.0|I love this book, it's been so long since we had a book out that kids couldn't wait to read. I can't wait to read this book to my kids one day. If you want to read a book that will make you hope that there is a school that teaches magic out there this is it. If you want to see good fight evil this is the book for you and if you just want to escape grab this book and read it!! Also I'm really big on reading this book with your kids you'll both love it and the myths and history that you can talk to the kids about is a great subject to expand learning
B00082IJ08|3.0|I have to admit I didn't think the first Gorillaz album was anything to write home about so getting \\"Demon Days\\" wasn't high on my list. My taste in music is so not hip hop orientated which would probably be the reason why I didn't care for the first Gorillaz album. I bought \\"Demon Days\\" after I heard the song \\"Dare\\" a few times on the local modern rock station. I was hooked. I have to say \\"Demon Days\\" is better than the first album. There were a lot more songs that I did like such as \\"Last Living Souls\\" and \\"O Green World\\". I don't mind the hip hop beats so much as I did on the previous album. It is Damon Albarn's high pitched vocals that rankled my nerves. One of my personal favorite tracks on the album is \\"Feel Good Inc.\\". Damon is actually not annoying on this song. The beat is pretty tight. Perfect music to play at a nightclub. \\"Dirty Harry\\" is a pretty decent track when the children aren't singing which I found rather unnerving. I wish I could have liked the cd more but I simply couldn't. The first half of the cd is definitely better than the last half (with the exception of \\"Dare\\").Overall not bad but not what I consider to be very good either.
B00005JO1P|4.0|<br /> <br />It's hard to watch someone fighting their demons.  Harder still when your sense is that an actor is achieving that kind of believability on screen because he, too, demons that he struggles with.  Such is the feeling you get from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash in \\"Walk the Line\\".   When Phoenix, as Cash, wakes up with his face in the dirt, wet and miserable from a walk to Carter's house (his car has been repossessed), you get the sense that Phoenix has been there in his own life.   <br /> <br />Based primarily on John's autobiography, \\"Walk the Line\\" tells the story of John's life as a young adult, just learning to play the guitar, just breaking into song writing, just starting the tough road that was touring from place to place to place to endless place.  The tearing of a life as a husband and father with the endlessness of the road is portrayed, and the film traces Johnny's particular demons back to his childhood with the death of his beloved older brother, Jack, and the callousness of his father, a sharecropper named Ray Cash (Robert Patrick, the villain in Terminator II, in a steely portrayal).   <br /> <br />Woven through the life on the road is John's growing love and obsession with June Carter.  A young veteran of road life, Carter was the daughter of Maybelle Carter, perhaps one of this country's finest female musicians.  June had toured and sung with the family Carter since she was a young girl.  A comedienne, Carter is portrayed as she has always been viewed....as a good and shining person, someone who could be held up to the light, someone who could help Johnny break away from the demons he ran into on the road, and during the lowest hiatus in his career.   <br /> <br />This movie, although a pretty accurate biopic about Johnny's life, is really the love story between Cash and June....a love story finished out in the ensuing 35+ years of marriage.  There's amazing chemistry between Johnny and June on the screen, during their duets (\\"Jackson\\"is amazing!), and while they are spinning in each other's orbit.  It must have been hard for Carter to come to terms with her feelings for such a troubled man.  In the film, this upheaval, as well as Johnny's demons could have been better portrayed by linking the songs they wrote to the events they were living.  (The script DOES look at the creative songwriting process and explore what the writer was doing when they wrote one song each....\\"Folsom Prison\\" by Johnny and \\"Ring of Fire\\" by June).  She wrote the song that John made famous, but the Ring of Fire was all about the way she felt, falling in love with someone as dangerous as John could be, and all after she'd made two mistakes in marriage and twice had to go through divorce (divorce was such a swear word in the 50's and 60's!).  The Bible-thumping Christian community that was the backbone of the Carter family's audience, subtly let June know how they felt about this seeming recklessness in her own life.  This is beautifully portrayed in the film by an awkward moment between Witherspoon and a fan in a local store.  The woman seems friendly, but in a few words, cuts Carter's self esteem to ribbons with a reference to the sin of divorce.   <br /> <br />In this film the director (James Mangold) lets the entire picture revolve around the characters' performances.  There is little symbolism, little depth in the story, just a telling of events.  An interesting character study with a look at some famous old musicians (Waylon Jennings, Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, etc.) and how their lives were intertwined.  Phoenix and young actress Reese Witherspoon are inspired and inspiring in their portrayals. Phoenix has the sheen in his skin of a pill popping alcoholic...his look of exhaustion and hopelessness is gut wrenching.  He studied films of Johnny and has the strange stance of John holding a guitar...the smirk, the shoulder rolls, down to a science.  He IS Johnny Cash.  Witherspoon is a perfect counterpart - you sense her loyalty and her pull towards Johnny even when she is trying her hardest to be a good person.  Both stars sing very well.  The music is plentiful and stays with you long after you leave the theater...T Bone Burnett gives as much to the world with this musical collection as Phoenix does with his performance.   Even producer James Leach ( a personal friend of Johnny Cash) makes a cameo as the warden of Folsom Prison.   <br /> <br />Like last year's \\"Ray\\", \\"Walk the Line\\" is a vehicle for major performances, for career-changing roles by the actors, but, as a film, is somewhat flawed and bound by being a collection of events instead of a true story.  It's definitely worth a trip to the theater, but 5 star performances don't compensate for an underwhelming script.  4 stars.   <br />
B000AMPZGC|5.0|Danny Elfman is perhaps the most underappreciated composers in the music industry. His work on soundtracks like \\"Batman\\" and \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is perhaps the best examples of his talent as a composer. His latest work \\"Corpse Bride\\" is another great soundtrack to add to his body of soundtracks. The music on the soundtrack is a good combination of haunting and playful melodies. The actors in the film all contribute to the vocals on the album and surprisingly they were all good, especially Helena Bonham Carter who really stood out with me on the gorgeous ballad \\"Tears to Shed\\". \\"The Wedding Song\\" is a loud, over the top number which is another favorite track of mine. My favorite moment in the song when the guests starts singing about the bride. I especially loved the instrumental tracks like \\"Victor's Piano Solo\\" and \\"The Piano Duet\\". The four bonus tracks by Bonejangles and his Bone Boys are fun songs. When I saw the film, I thought the musical numbers were a bit over the top and annoying but as I listened to them again, I was surprised to find myself enjoying them more so. I love this movie and I love the music just as much now.
B000000OR9|4.0|this  band deserved a better fate. ok, considering it came out in 89, on  Geffen records, it would have  all the  ingredients for a hair metal album. but its actually not one. its an over the top  Straight forward old school classic more in tune with one of the brilliant NWOBHM bands of the late 70's/early 80's  with a pinch of speed metal and a dash of classic rock . Not surprising as Sykes  got his start with NWOBHM band the \\"tygers of pan tang\\" and Appice  goes back to the classic rock era himself. I think over time \\"Hair Metal\\" has proven itself to be  a Joke, as the more  underground metal of those days has continued on to  make  itself heard  in  this day and age i.e. thrash metal etc.  <br />  Blue murder deserves a place among the  Great metal albums of the 80's, not among the shlock  that was  Hair metal.  I think the fact that the members  were  OTT musicians first and foremost  makes this album  1 for the ages. a straight ahead Heavy Metal Gem
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Rebelious angry beret didn't pay off, neither did the brunette hair. This time around Madonna comes back as a carefree blonde disco kitten clad in pink hot pants. Now that's what most of her fans wanted her to be, isn't it? When the image doesn't sell well, it's time to replace it with another public-appealing persona. That's what M did.     \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is nearly everything it was promised to be - dance record, having fun non-stop etc. However, it doesn't pass for a \\"future disco\\". Why? There's nothing new to the music Madonna produced with Stuart Price. Heard it all before - Kylie, Cher, Holly Valance, Gwen Stefani are just few comparsions that come to mind. The fact that Madonna doesn't resist herself from \\"getting inspired\\" and \\"borrowing\\" samples from the other artists like Donna Summer, Goldfrapp, Sting, Jackson 5 or Abba, makes her Confessions even more of the Recycled Disco. Not that the cd isn't a worthwhile release - it is, indeed, a very good one in terms of production and delivering some really dancable tunes. It does make people jump out of their seats, it really does. The only problem is, those songs could've been done by anyone - they lack the Madonna factor, that could've given them identity and make us say; \\"Hey! This could've been only sung by Madonna\\" (which could be said of Vogue, Music, Express Yourself or even American Life).     Thematicly the songs can be listed in two categories - \\"M dealing with fame\\" and \\"LOVE\\", as usual. The lyrics are ok for dance music, though lame at times - but again, it's Madonna - she's never been a genius when it comes to writing lyrics.     Even though \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a pretty enjoyable record, it tends to be getting old quickly. The songs are cliched and repeative. This album would've been just brilliant, had Madonna released it 20 years ago, but now at the age of 47, having won the Grammies for the wonderful \\"Ray of Light\\", the singer should be more ambitious. To me, much underrated \\"American Life\\" beats COAD in terms of originality. While Confessions may be huge commercial success, AL remains the artistic one. I'd give Madonna's new album 5 stars, but keeping in mind all the things I mentioned above, I have to reduce my enthusiasm over it.    At the time of recording \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", Madonna confessed: \\"I no longer have time to be creative\\". I think that speaks the volumes.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|My title sums up what I think of this album.  Cheap, emotionally charged non- sensical lyrics designed to score points with pseudo intellectuals who will try and give meaning to the nonsense. Some of the riffs are great, but they never have a chance to develop into something greater, giving the music a disjointed feel. A particularly unsatisfying release...
0316286850|5.0|I live in Brazil and I've brought a copy from the USA,after coming across it in a jewelery store. I really love looking at it again and again from time to time! I've tried many looks in the book and they really work!The book contains lots of completely different 'wearable' and up-to-date ideas with step-by-step instructions that are hard to miss!Make-up's not basic but anyone can follow, and look great! <br />These days, after researching for long here at Amazon.com I imported 'Makeup Makeovers', but it has nothing to do!

B0007GAERG|2.0|Where are the good times when Mariah's voice sounded all over U.S. as a hymn to love  an sensuality? I used to like Mariah very much, and every time that she realeased an album I bought it and I wasn't disappointed  until the  \\"Glitter\\" album was released, which was a flop for her as well as the movie \\"Glitter\\". The \\"Charmbracelet\\" tha came afterwards gave me an impression that Mariah was back on track, so I ran to the stores to buy \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" as soon as it came out, to my deep disappointment there wasn't a single song I liked on this CD, the beat is rather boring and the lyrics are regular. She doesn't show anymore the full potential of her beautiful voice. <br /> If you don't know Mariah Carey's music I recommend you to buy her older albums such as \\"Daydream\\" \\"#1's\\" and \\"The Greatest hits\\"! They are great!
0553801503|5.0|So - right.  There's not a zillion people dying in A Feast For Crows.  No great armies clash - at least, not onscreen.  The wars of the previous two books are over, and the survivors are picking up the pieces and carving out new niches for themselves. <br /> <br />The world changes in this book.  If you're looking too hard for big, flashy, climactic moments, you'll be disappointed.  What's worse, you'll miss the ton of key events and political machinations that are slowly but surely reshaping Westeros and setting the stage for the grand finale I see glimmers of in the distance. <br /> <br />Not as much is happening TO the characters in this book as in earlier books, but that's not the point.  The point is what's happening AROUND the characters with the Iron Fleet, the common folk, the clergy, Riverrun, the Crown, the Tyrells, etc. <br /> <br />GRRM's writing is at an all-time high.  Every chapter is a elegantly self-contained short story that integrates smoothly with the overall plot arc.  It's so refereshing; the technique of ending every chapter with a cliffhanger seems archaic and trite in comparison. <br /> <br />Great book and looking forward to the next one!
B00000IQW5|5.0|I love this movie. It is ranked right up there with the best of them.
B00005JOHI|5.0|The movie seemed to be authentic on many fronts: House messy and dirty, mud in the front yard, pigs wandering into the house---but for a family with five girls, two parents and a cook, that was the way people lived (except for the very wealthy) in the late 18th century.  The country pastoral scenes were absolutely beautiful! The wealthy mansions, their art, statues and surrounding grounds were amazing! <br /> <br />This movie is a virtual dictionary of miscommunications, misunderstandings, wrong judgements of others, manipulations, power, control, greed, etc.  But on the positive side, also of love, genuine caring for the lives of others, shyness, passion and truth.   <br /> <br />Happily, all the right people eventually get together after the eleven main characters (each with their own agenda and totally different personalities) are thrown together in the cauldron pot we call \\"society\\".  It is more than a love story----that's why men will like this movie--it is a picture--a \\"snap\\" in the camera of time of the constant worry of having enough money, of wealth, of position, of high character and low; but also of truth, honesty, patience, lying, deception and manipulation.   <br /> <br />But the higher virtues of truth, forgivness and love win out over the baser virtues (light is stronger than darkness), and that is why this story is a \\"classic\\" and shall remain so for generations.  I see a real life Cinderella and Prince Charming. <br />
B0006L16N8|2.0|I suppose this is an album created solely for the people who loved the biggest <br />hits from 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' : In My Place, Clocks, The Magician.  I liked the latter two, but in truth, these three are sugary pablum; and there are far better songs on 'Rush of Blood'.  X&Y is an album filled entirely with songs that evoke those three songs, and not one of the songs on X&Y is even as good.  They're all worse.  My personal favorites from 'Rush' (in order of appearance) were 'God Put a Smile On Your Face', 'Green Eyes',  'Warning Sign' and the title track.  There isn't anything on this album that is similar to those four.  This album is a huge disappointment - I mean, imagine if you will, an ENTIRE Beatles album that sounds like 'When I'm 64', when you were hoping for an entire album tht sounded like 'A Day In the Life.'   That's how this feels.   If you want an album filled with second rate imitations of the most sugary stuff from 'Rush of Blood', you might enjoy this one.
B0000844I8|4.0|Did extraterrestial travellers visit Egypt long before the time of the Pharoahs' and construct the pyramids using a form of technology beyond our understanding even by todays standards? Is history as we know it based on wrong assumptions and misinterpretations of the historical record? Or better yet, has the real history of the planet Earth been willfully and purposely hidden from us by those who don't want us to know the truth?<br /><br />Stargate asks you to challenge some of those basic assumptions and simply sit back and enjoy a cosmic adventure transporting a renegade Egyptologist and a band of military personnal across the universe via an alien device known as a 'Stargate.' This small band of explorers instantaneously arrive on a distant planet where they will not only discover a civilization much like what once existed on ancient Earth, but the forgotten origin of man's belief in heavenly powers and those beings of myth and legend that were worshipped as Gods.<br /><br />James Spader is perfect as Daniel Jackson, the brilliant Eygptologist with the cutting edge theories as is Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O'Neil, the emotionally dead but duty bound commandeer in charge of the expedition. Also great performances from Jay Davidson as the Sun God, Ra and the very attractive Mili Avital as Sha'uri. Everything works in this sci-fi extravaganza; cinematography and special effects are first rate as is the screenplay.<br /><br />Throughly enjoyable from beginning to end and it will leave you with something to think about and maybe explore on your own concerning some of the unorthodox beliefs circulating around today concerning man's past and destiny. It never hurts to think outside of the box.
B000096IBI|5.0|Chaplin's immortal comedy about industrial society is as funny and hard-hitting today as it was back then.  His Tramp's constant attempt to find comfort in any way possible (even institutionalizing himself) along with the plight of the orphan girl is yet another example of his perfect handle on comedic drama and how to make people laugh while feeling really depressed at the same time.<br /><br />This movie was made in 1936, long after sound had taken over cinema, and beyond just being a satire of industry and \\"modern times\\", it's a farewell of sorts to the Tramp proper.  People wanted to know what the Tramp sounded like, and Chaplin knew that his character didn't work in sound, so even though this was made late, it's still silent... except for sound added in primarily to create a feeling of abuse.<br /><br />A few things are turned around this time.  Instead of trying to get the girl, the girl gets along quite fine staying with him.  But what's most interesting, especially to Chaplin fans, is the finally where the Tramp \\"sings.\\"  Finally the image of sound as oppression is discarded, the Tramp learns to be vocal, everyone loves him and thinks he's brilliant, yet still the world oppresses and he's forced to walk away with the promise that \\"We'll manage.\\"<br /><br />And we never see the Tramp again.<br /><br />It is quite a powerful film (even while it splits your sides with laughter) and definitely one of his best.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B00005JO1J|5.0|*SPOILERS!!!*<br /><br />OK, i'm a fan of -La Boheme- who never experienced -Rent- before.  So i expected Mimi [Rosario Dawson, sparkling in her role as a heroin addict] to die in Roger's [Adam Pascal, also brilliant as the AIDS-infected songwriter who can't get a song together] arms.  & the very beginning, w/the actors all singing \\"Seasons of Love\\" on a bare, brilliantly-lit stage, prepares 1 to distance 1self.  Jonathan Larson may have re-created the operaetta as a semi-biographical paen to \\"La Vie Boheme\\" ... so i *expected* it to be *like* the operetta: sweet but not intimate.<br /><br />What i wasn't expecting was the incandescent fire of the character of Angel  [Wilson Jermaine Heredia].  He's a show all by himself as the sassy drag queen who befriends Tom Collins [Jesse L. Martin, owner of a fine bass voice who generously gives Heredia screen space to shine], literally picking him out of the gutter where he'd been chased by thugs intent of robbery. It seemsthat every1 has AIDS in  this 90's tale ... AZT timers are the rage, & a support group [in which people slowly fade away] plays a major role.<br /><br />Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, who's making a documentary about the eight friends, Idina Menzel as Maureen Johnson, the girl who tossed him aside for another woman [Tracie Thoms], & Taye Diggs as Benjamin Coffin III, who has betrayed his aristic friends by marrying into the wealthy family who owns the dilapidated building [where Mark & Roger & Mimi live] which they plan to demolish & build a  high-tech theatre -- all are competent, if no outstanding.  & it's a bit hard to believe these healthy 30-year olds are starving 20ish AIDS victims.<br /><br />But it'd all worthwhile when Heredia steps onstage.  Even his tragic - but not unanticipated - death resonates, giving Martin a chance to shatter the screen w/his grief.  The other six react well as well, but Martin ... well, it hurts just to think about his sob-supressed reprise of \\"I'll Cover You\\", the song w/which Angel wooed him.  The \\"525,600 minutes ... about the way that he lived/& the way that she died\\" are about Angel ... & the movie underscores it by ending w/a picture of Angel as a him/her sexual enigma.,600 minutes ... about the way that he lived/& the way that she died\\" are about Angel ... & the movie underscores it by ending w/a picture of Angel as a him/her sexual enigma.
B000BM6AVA|3.0|Daron's singing has ruined SYSTEM OF A DOWN... this album is only good if you can tune out his singing. That aside, this album can't even be compared to the band's first two. While the first album was so filled with energy, that it makes you want to get up and tackle your mom in the kitchen in an attempt to start a mosh pit, this latest album just wants to make you get up and tackle your mom over frustation with Daron's singing. I just wish the band would get back to what they were went I first became a fan of theirs (after seeing them in 1997 at the ICE HOUSE in So. Cal).
B000065BPB|5.0|These cans provide superb response at all points along the range, and their quality knocked me out after having used a cheap pair for years (which, incidentally, still is in use as a secondary pair) which replaced a set I'd used dating from the mid-70s. You really have to work to get this pair to crackle or break up on deep tones, and it's never done so for me. If you've been using tinny cans for years, it's probably a good idea to start using this set at lower volumes as underestimating the bass will leave one with a damaged-feeling set of ears. It's got all the power I need, and then some. <br /> <br />On the flip side, this set is very precise, and will pick up noise from inside your computer if plugged into the audio jack or even a SoundBlaster soundcard - little whines and hisses as the computer's optical drive spins up, or programs are loaded into memory. <br /> <br />The headphones put out lots of sound - enough that you can flip the cans to face outward and use them as ad-hoc speakers for somebody in the room - but when they're settled around your head only you will be able to hear what's being played. I value sound and not disturbing the solitude of others, and this set scores perfectly on both fronts. <br /> <br />As noted by other reviewers, after time this set's headband starts to shed plastic. After years of daily use, the inside of the plastic band underneath the padded center bar and right above the cans has broken off on both sides, but the band still holds firm. Do be careful not to throw this set around, however. <br /> <br />As I recall, the set starts out overly light, but loosened up quickly and is now quite pleasant to wear, if heavy. Folks who have long hair might be annoyed by this pair, and if you're into the \\"light and airy\\" phones market, you might be well served to pick up another set.
B000B8QF14|1.0|STOP BEFORE YOU GIVE YOUR MONEY TO WARNER BROTHERS THINK OF A BETTER USE FOR IT.... CHARITY!!!! HOMELESS TEENAGERS... CANCER VICTUMS.. AIDS... POOR AND STARVING CHILDREN IN THE 3RD WORLD... INNER CITY YOUTH PROGRAMS... BREAST CANCER FOUNDATIONS...back to the review <br /> While i never thought it was possible for Green Day to \\"sellout\\" (quotes becaues they never really stood for anything so there recent capitalism crusise doesnt actually go against anything they formally believed in) anymore they proved everyone wrong by selling a video recording of a horrible $50 show for $25 and likely to those who went to one of there concerts. Just to show how much money green day is making off of you(the hardcore I LOVE BILLIE group) we will make a list. First you bought AMerican idiot 15.99(because they never made an album worth listening to before that). After hearing the cd you rush out and buy tickets to their next geographically convient show $50(or more). at the concert after you hear them play there rebellious and inspiring music live you are drawn to buy there $20 tshirt $15 poster(yes a piece of paper can cost you $15 which of coarse borders on r*pe) and thier $35 IPOD CASE(i dont know if its at their shows but its on there website) after all that \\"great musical experiance\\" you decided you want to join their fan club \\"the idiot club\\" {m not even kidding go to their website the fan club is actually call the idiotclub9go figure] but alas you must pay $20 a year to be a fan and so your total green day dollors rises yet again to a HUGE total of $159.99 (not wuite 160) having just forked out a total of >$160 they then add insult to injury by trying to repackage all that into a convient $25 cd/dvd making the total waste of money you  just spent >$185   <br />SAVE YOUR MONEY THEY SUCK HARDCORE!!! <br />GIVE YOUR MONEY TO A BETTER CAUSE... NOT GREEN DAY OR THE FAT WALLETS OF WARNER BROTHERS!!!
B000BM6AVA|5.0|this album is great.  if you were one of the many who didn't like mezmerize, don't fret.  hypnotize sounds much more like their old stuff, although there are a few songs that still sound like they could fit in with mezmerize.  but it is back to the soad that everyone knows and loves, so if you weren't sure if you'd like it, you prob will <br />(for the record i did like mez but i prefer hypnotize)
B00000IREA|3.0|Jane Fonda, her blonde tresses teased in '60's sex-kitten high style, deadpans her way through erotic sci-fi romp about a missing scientist from Earth tracked down on a distant planet by Barbarella, a four-star Astral Navigatrix with a penchant for losing her clothes. Ticklish, skittish live-action comic strip has the look and color schemes down just right, but the handling is sometimes so wooden it's uncertain how some sequences are supposed to play. In any case, the film deserves better DVD treatment than this: Paramount has used the 1970's re-release art-work on the cover, which is atrocious, and kept the elongated title (also 1970's) which was completely unnecessary. It includes no bonuses (CNN \\"Headliners\\" showed part of an interview Fonda did on the set, in costume, that certainly could've been added here). Of all the major studios, Paramount ranks as one of the very worst in preserving and presenting their classics, and fans of \\"Barbarella\\" deserve more.
0670033375|4.0|So many reviewers who panned this book argue that Diamond's supporting examples come from tiny obscure countries and islands and therefore, his evidence is weak. However, I say that criticizing Diamond by attacking anthropology as a valid means of scientific investigation, is far weaker. While many of his ancient examples of societal collapse may be on a smaller scale, the factors that operate are universally applicable. This is what is known as the study of anthropology. Furthermore, modern-day China (one of the largest countries in the world) and Australia (a country the size of the United States) have entire chapters devoted to them.   To counter some of the other popular criticisms...No, Diamond is not a racist. The reason he excludes 'Rome' is not because he hates Westerners, but rather because Rome is not an example of an environmental collapse. Which brings me to my next point...he specifically states that the book is only about environmental collapse, he acknowledges that environmental collapse is not the only form of collapse and does not claim that all collapses are environmental (as some critics have written). And despite the dramatic title (not a fair criticism either, as all publishers demand catchy titles to sell books), this book is not full of 'gloom and doom'. Diamond gives us several examples of success and his entire thesis is that we have the power to choose (the title reads 'How Societies *CHOOSE* to fail or succeed). His writing is clear, fair, unbiased, apolitical and even after presenting painstakingly researched evidence he acknowledges every possible gap in his conclusions, right down the most minute crevice, like any true scientist would.   \\"Collapse\\" is highly informative, full of factual information and sensitive to it's audience. The only complaint I have is that he didactically repeats certain points over and over when he could have condensed the information into a much shorter text. But perhaps he felt that his audience might not hearhim unless he explained it in several different ways using a plethora of examples to drive home the point (and perhaps his concern was rightly justified, given the numerous readers who, despite his efforts, still didn't get it). While it has been known since it's invention that anthropology is not a 'hard' science like physics or math, anthropology is far far away from the trashy realm of pseudoscience and Diamond himself is anything but a polemicist.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|I was never a fan of Mayer before. Whatever he did had been done better and much before. A certain someone called Dave Matthews?! Ring a bell? Sure Mayer used fairly complex chords but when your one hit is called \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" who are you kidding. Its selling out 101. Most would call it smart. Sellout, get a hit single, get some chics an apartment in Soho maybe and then lets talk real music. I saw his performance at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Concert and I was floored. The boy could play and it burned me up (being a player myself) that a guy with that kinda skill would write a song like \\"body\\" What a waste!<br /><br />So then I read an interview when he says hes done with this acoustic mumbo jumbo. I got excited.. oh look hes come to his senses. Then he claims himself to be the resurrector of the blues, like its the second coming of christ for the blues. Lets get this straight, Clapton is still alive, Buddy Guy is still alive, BB King is still alive for cryin out loud! Mayer save the blues... lets not get hasty.<br /><br />But coming the point. The albums not half bad. The guitar work is impressive. They have the old school feel but nothing really grabs you. Its like a bunch of Clapton and SRV licks thrown together with some Hendrix for good measure. \\"Out of my mind\\" has some soulful guitar work. \\"Who did u think I was\\" rocks hard. But the boy shouldnt sing.. his voice isn't raspy enough to go with this stuff, or it just feels out of place in after hearing in those forgettable albums of the past. In the end if you want a breath of fresh air from all the crap out there.. this might be it!
B000BOH8XW|5.0|I got the promo CD and my first impression is: Very Good!. It's not brilliant or perfect only because she still lacks of his magic lyrics that she delivers in her spanish albums. But still is a very ambitious pop/rock album. This album include 2 songs of Fijacion Oral Vol. 1, \\"En tus pupilas\\" a really good pop-ballad song and \\"Dia Especial\\" featuring Gustavo Cerati (Former lead singer of Soda Stereo)... the songs are renamed \\"Something\\" and \\"The Day and the Time\\" respectively. Most recommended songs: \\"Timor\\", \\"Hey you\\", \\"Illegal\\" and \\"Animal City\\"....
B000BM6AVA|4.0|All I have to say about this album specifically (and mezmerize too) is that it's very good. It certainly isn't the best thing I've ever heard in my life, but it's more than worthy of its price. <br /> <br />More importantly, I thought it was worth replying to all the hate against Daron's voice. He's really not a bad vocalist, I enjoy his solo parts, but the best thing about his newfound confidence in singing is the harmony parts with Serj. The two have such contrasting voices, yet they really interact and just work so well together, it's the best thing about this System Of A Down in its current incarnation. Disagree with me, but I don't care. These two are brilliant.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|When Alicia Keys came out..I was a alwayz a fan of her. Both of her albums are the greatest and if your a true R&B fan you shoud at least have 1 of her cdz!! <br /> <br />Harlem's Nocturne- Good interlude..Kinda reminds me of the Songs in a Minor album intro.. N/A <br /> <br />Karma- At first this song has a GREAT beat and the lyrics are hot but after it became it too popular it got boring...but i still give it da same score i thought it should be 9/10 <br /> <br />Heartburn- The song is HOT!! The drums are a GREAT add-on to the song. Alicia was smart to compare heartburn to lovin someone..haha!! 9.5/10 <br /> <br />If I Was Your Woman/Walk On By- At the first verse..I was like umm...this kinda sux but after a while I started really feeling her lyrics and beat. 8/10 <br /> <br />You Don't Know My Name- When I first heard this I was like OMG this song is REALLY HOT!! Cuz it's a great a song and is has a storyline to it as well...9.5/10 <br /> <br />If I Ain't Got You- This is probably the hottest song she has EVER made since Fallin'!!!! I don't even care how many times i listen to it..I still LOVE IT!!! 11/10! <br /> <br />Diary- This song is really good when your into slow songs. But if you listen to the whole Cd and suddenly go to a slow song its kinda bad but its still good. Tony Toni Tone was really awesome as well. 8/10 <br /> <br />Dragon Days- A lot of people really like this song but I'm not into the beat. The lyrics are tight but the beat doesn't really match the meaning of her words. (The gutair is good though haha) 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Wake Up- This song really stands out in the album. The vocals and beat really mix together and really speaks her mind on this one. 9/10 <br /> <br />So Simple- At first I was like um..this doesn't sound good...but after 10 seconds I was like OMG this is tight!! haha! But, this song is really hot. It really shows her emtions in this one. 10/10 <br /> <br />When You Really Love Someone- I don't know why but this song kinda reminds me a mix of Fallin' and A Woman's Worth. It even has the same concept too. HAHA! 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Feeling U, Feeling Me- Interlude..Really Good N/A <br /> <br />Slow Down- This song os ok i guess..it reminds me of Dragon Days..The lyrics REALLY speak out but the slow beat just doesn't match. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Samsonite Man- O My Gosh this is one of the hottest songs in this album!! It really talks bout just kickin that damn man out!!!

Rather than live in the shadow of the original film, THE LONGEST YARD manages to set up a decent comedy of its own, despite being formulaic and cheesy at times.<br /><br />By now, you should be very familiar with the plot: Paul Crewe (Adam Sandler) is a former NFL star, who was indicted for throwing a game and has been recently picked up for reckless driving.  He gets the opportunity to round up a bunch of prison misfits to form a \\"prisoner\\" football team, set to go head-to-head with the prison guards.  Crewe's rag-tag bunch does remarkably well and the warden of the prison begins to worry about his chances of winning.  In turn, Crewe is faced with a moral dilemma: throw the game again and save his skin or play the game and risk his life.<br /><br />THE LONGEST YARD is the very definition of a formula comedy, but I still managed to eek out some entertainment from it.  The supporting cast is really quite superb if you take a close look at it.  While the not the greatest film I've seen all year, it does provide the people with exactly what they want: mind-numbing entertainment.  Just don't spend $20 on it.  Trust me.  You won't like it that much.
0792164903|4.0|\\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" is one of my favorite short stories of all-time.  There is something about this American folk tale that captivates my mind and imagination.  I can remember watching the Disney animated version of the tale as a kid around Halloween time.  It was pure magic.  And later, while studying English literature in college, I returned to the stories of Washington Irving with an \\"adult\\" and critical eye.  Yet, despite the deadlines of college and the sheer mass of reading to accomplish, I always took special time out to enjoy Irving's work.  It can make you a kid again.<br /><br />SLEEPY HOLLOW delivered on all of my high expectations for the film.  While I am normally upset by films that depart from the stories they purport to represent, Burton has managed to capture the feel and appeal of the legend, while at the same time churning out an entertaining Hollywood picture.  In my opinion, almost no one does this better than Tim Burton and he deserves much credit for it.  Of course, true fans of the legend will be disappointed by Burton's take, but I think that once viewers have allowed themselves to live in Burton's world for a while (and not Irving's), SLEEPY HOLLOW can be a great deal of fun.<br /><br />SLEEPY HOLLOW is, from a visual perspective, absolutely stunning.  Burton transports us to early-American New England, complete with haunted mysts and plenty of gore.  The action sequences with the Headless Horseman are marvelous and rank among some of the finest action sequences I've seen lately.  Another thing that SLEEPY HOLLOW nails is its comedic sensibility.  Burton's films are usually quite good at maintaining a level of \\"fun\\" throughout their length and this picture is no exception.  There is plenty of comedy to lighten the mood of the picture and allow it to take itself less seriously.<br /><br />Overall, SLEEPY HOLLOW is just a great horror/macabre picture, the kind that only Burton is capable of pulling off.  So if you find a deal, buy this picture, make yourself a bowl of popcorn, and just let yourself go.a deal, buy this picture, make yourself a bowl of popcorn, and just let yourself go.
B000B0WODA|3.0|who I imagine is having plenty of laughs at the bank and the bar while they still can about foisting some genuinely disturbed and cynical music on an audience who thinks they are \\"catchy\\",\\"fun\\",and \\"inspiring\\". I can count the number of reviewers on one hand so far that acknowledge that this album is rather dark. I mean, just who the heck is Franz Ferdinand anyway? Is the lead singer a depressed, drug gobbling bisexual? One might conclude that with a perfunctory listen, and perhaps he's just pulling legs on the bisexual thing, but the songs are mostly from what I can tell about botched, bleak relationships- maybe one amiable 'dance' hit in \\"Do You Want To\\", and some socio-political commentary thrown in on a few songs like \\"The Fallen\\" and \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\". What is \\"inspiring\\" about that, I ask? Well, Franz will take your money anyway, even if you have no idea that you might be dancing to someone else's suicidal impulse. I guess I can't blame anyone for it, we are all guilty of this type of grotesque voyeurism when we listen to music. But for those who don't know what I'm saying, here's your review:    \\"This album rocks! It's full of the same catchy hooks that their first album had, and I just wanna dance around when it is on! Go buy it NOW, you'll love it like I did!!!!\\"    So far as the sound goes,if you like old 60's British Invasion coupled with 70's New Wave, you'll like this.

B00005JNJV|1.0|I was about to see this in theatres because everyone was saying it was so good but I didn't have time. Since most others have gone into some plot and story detail i won't waste time here with that.  <br /> <br />So here's my take on this movie. <br /> <br />Batman's costume wasn't that good. It looked heavy and the pointy bat ears were really short- which they aren't supposed to be. Since when does batman have a raspy voice? I hated batman talking like he had a sorethroat. I mean he's a multi-billionaire and it only costs like 2-3 bucks for a bag of cough drops. The batmobile was like a tank. The batmobile is supposed to be a car, not a tank. It's batMOBILE, not batTANK. <br /> <br /> <br />Christian Bale as batman was good but not good enough. Batman is supposed to be like 6\\"2. Christian Bale is quite short actually, Katie Holmes was taller than him as well as the butler. I mean come on the butler is taller than batman!? The directors did a poor job finding an actor for this. <br /> <br />The beginning is very slow however it is expected as the title says 'Batman Begins'. <br /> <br />I'm no hardcore batman fan, meaning I don't often read the comics or frequent batman message boards, but I do know batman is supposed one of the most respected and intelligent heroes. Alot of people are forgetting what batman really is, and they are only thinking about the action infront of their eyes in the film. Batman is intelligent, he figures out mysteries he makes good descisions. I didn't really see any of that in Batman's character in Batman Begins. <br /> <br />The plot in Batman was really weak. I mean we have already seen the train scene in Spiderman 2 why do they finish with something like that? I did not feel the climax of the movie at all as a I watched it. All batman does is battle his mentor on a train while it's about to go off the tracks. We've seen batman throw punches and kicks earlier in the movie! Why do they give us the same thing and people are happy with it? I'm tired of Hollywood giving us the same crappy predictable movies and everyone is happy with it. The story was alright but it was so dumbed down to typical Hollywood Blockbuster level with the unrequited love between Holmes/Bale with the worse being the end with yet another train hurtling towards the destruction of something ala Speed and more recent Spiderman 2. This was a remix of a movie abet better then previous attempts but that is not saying much. Alot of people liked this movie, I didn't. It was horrible for me I hope people agree with me.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BB1MHS|2.0|I saw Willy Wonka movie when I was child and fell in love with the movie, so I decided to watch this Charlie movie when it came out on DVD.  Even though lot of the reviewers gave a bad rating for this movie, I wanted to rent it and see it for myself.  While I was watching the movie, I could not help but keep saying to myself in my head the word \\"strange\\" over and over again.  I don't know how else to describe this movie.  The original movie took my breath away when the children first walked into the Willy Wonka factory, but in the Charlie movie, I thought the whole thing looked more fake then anything else, especially the grass part.  Some of the reviewers kept saying that Johnny Dep was not Willy Wonka, but it was the little kid Charlie that had grown up.  Then why did all the kids and the local towns people call him Willy?  Why did that little kid who went into the facotory was named Charlie?  Johnny Depp did played the part of Willy Wonka, because as you can see in the movie that this movie explained how Willy became Willy Wonka the candy maker.  This was the only part of the movie that I liked, because it explained little about Willy's child hood and how it all got started.  The part that I thought it was a little extremem was where the kids are walking through the Charlie factory, and you see a cow all strapped up getting whipped with wips over and over again.  Then, Charlie says \\"oh, I get it, a whiped milk\\".  I thought to myself \\"is this a kid's movie?\\"  I can just see bunch of kids running to a cow and start beating the cow with their dad's belt trying to get whipped milk.  I thought that was a little violent and was not necessary.  Also, this movie showed Willy arguing with little kids, or saying sarcastic remarks alot.  I liked the original Willy Wonka, because the character was belivable and likable.  This one with Johnny Depp, was not likable but just strange and bizzard.  Johnny Depp should stick with making movies like Pirates of Carribean.  I loved the Oompa music in the original one, but just end up hating it in this movie.  The music was not very catchy at all.  Does anyone who has seen the movie even remember one song from this movie?  Also, I thought when the last part where it showed Willy Wonka's elavator taking off the roof was a good idea, because it actually explained where they went when they took off from the eleavator, the original ended after taking off the elavator but did not explaine where they went.   <br /> <br />Spoiler! <br /> <br />But, after seeing where they went, I just rolled my eyes.  The elavator crashed into Charlie's home.  I thought that they would just let the elavator down gently next to Charlie's home, but no they crashed through the roof.  I am supriesed that they didn't end up killing someone.  I thought this movie was not for kids at all, well at least not for really young kids.  I do regreat renting this movie.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Mariah is nothing but a fat low life money scavenger, who hates her fans and loves to rip them off. She has no talent, and needs to lose some of that fat on her body before she releses anything else. Seriously, she is just milking the cow with this trashy mediocre album, <br /> <br />Madonna is beautiful, and is a living legend. Mariah is just an old, worn out, fat wannabe!! <br /> <br />Note to mariah:  Can't you afford jenny craig??
B00008LDPU|1.0|This was a strange movie.  Bunch of different sections of the Matrix movis is in this movie.  I tell you, I have seen some great animated movies, but this one bored me to death.  It did however, explained little more about Matrix itself, but the sections do end abrubtly, so you don't know what happends to lot of those characters in each of those sections.  If I could give zero stars then I would have.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I could watch this DVD almost every night.Leonardo DiCaprio is a FANTASTIC actor.You really believe your watching Howard Hughes.I hope there's a part 2 soon because the film ends in 1947.
0440211727|4.0|I read this book at the same time I read another NY Times bestseller, Crooked Tree (by Robert C. Wilson).  Both were excellent stories and written so that you just couldn't put them down until you found out what happened. <br />The biggest difference; the ending of Crooked Tree was fantastic and believable...the ending of Time to Kill was like 'would the KKK really just leave after they lost?'  No. <br />If I had to choose one to read again, its Crooked Tree.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I loved this movie a lot. It was bit scary, very violents, sad, depressing, and utterly funny. Even though each character in the story has very little screen time. The characters(to me at least) that have the most screen time are Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Rosario Dawson. They have very important roles in the movie. There screen time are in different segments of the movie and all these different events are happening over a period of 1 night. There is a cannibal in this movie played by Elijah Wood and he eats people. Its really scary and the violence is so bloody even though the movie is only in Black, White, Yellow, red it shows some skin tone to Jessica Albas character at the bar. Many of the other characters including Alba dont have much screen time. But Jessica Alba just ties the whole movie together. Its very interesting and a little bit bizarre. But my favorite part of the movie is the segment \\"Big Fat Kill\\" its where Clive Owens character is very angry by the way Jackie Boy is treating his new girlfriend Shellie. He wants to get rid of him Shellie his very abused by him but she takes it. He finally says he is going to kill him but as he jumps 5 stories out of the apartment building she screams stop but she was really screaming cop. Jackie Boy wants to attack a hooker so he chooses Becky(Alexis Bledel) then soon all the hookers gang up on him and finally kill him but then they dont realize that Jackie Boy was a cop and when a cop gets killed other cops join in and get rid of all the hookers. They want to stay calm So all the hookers decide to go home Becky goes and she is actually telling her mother whom she loves dearly that she isnt a hooker and she is always talking to her on the phone every night just to hear her voice but not this time she goes and tells the police department what happened. Gail gets really angry and then Dwight(Clive Owen) comes to save the day. Finally the whole entire police is dead Becky gets shot in the shoulder butshe doesnt die she hides in an alley to escape all the gun shots and finally the big fat kill is over. That was my favorite Segement. Their are other segements involve other characters. This does have some confusing parts but it is indeed a very good story. At the end Becky gets out of the hospital with a sling and a bandage over her neck because gail bit her there. Shes still talking to her mother when a doctor who is actually a hit man is in the elevator with her and nobody else. Suddenly he says Becky do you want a smoke and she gets really scared and shocked then she says a dramatic I love you to her mom and she knows that will be her last conversation with her mom. the audience assumes that either Gail or Dwight hired him to go and kill Becky. It can be really confusing but i loved it anyways.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This is a really great CD! It has been a long time coming! Well worth the wait of 5 years!
B00003CXRM|3.0|This movie is a good example of why Hollywood needs to give screenwriters more respect.  The actors are good, and each scene in isolation is well-done and funny.  But the story is only hinted at, and the characters come off as cardboard stereotypes.  Just a little more attention to the storytelling craft would have made this a magnificent movie. <br /> <br />The movie is enjoyable to watch, as long as you do not have high expectations.  Despite its flaws, I give the movie three stars because the scenes are enjoyable to watch.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|According to my 7 year old nephew \\"I think that the publishers of this package should make other 30th editions for other albums of Bruce Springsteens. I like the DVD's a lot. I also like how they took the \\"Born To Run\\" CD and made it look like a vinyl record. My favorite song is 10th Avenue freeze-out. I'm glad my aunt Libby bought this for me.\\"
B000B8QEZG|4.0|To the reviewer (you're not half the man you think you are) who gave this album one star and wrote:     \\"...and this no-name Stuart Price is really hurting Madonna's career. She should work with successful, creative and talented producers if she wants to make it in today's music biz.\\"    You clearly do not know what you are talking about.  Stuart Price is one of the top producers in the world.  I'm not sure what it takes in your mind \\"to make it in today's music biz\\" but the album debuted at number 1 around the world including the United States.      The album itself is very good and has a number of excellent moments:    Yes, the song \\"I Love New York\\" is impossible to listen to but many of the lyrical moments of the other songs are brilliant and make up for this.  Try not to sing (and dance) along to the following:    \\"Sorry\\": \\"I don't want to hear.  I don't want to know.  Please don't say you're sorry.  I heard it all before and I can take care of myself...\\"     \\"Jump\\": \\"I'll work and I'll fight 'til I find a place of my own.  Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump...\\"    If you read through the reviews with the lowest ratings, it's amazing how angry some people are, and sometimes just evil.  This is a pop album kids!  Lighten up!  Madonna's been around for decades, please don't tell me you had no idea what to expect!
B00005JOHI|1.0|This movie is reason enough to contemplate burning the book.  Although Jane Austen's original work was not the best, this movie is the epitome of monotony.  Nothing interesting happens at all.  It is essentially one of the most generic and boring styles of cinema: a love story with no twists and no added elements of suspense or uncertainty.  Again, Hollywood fails to do anything more than reprint a book on screen and bore us all to death in the process.  Make no mistake:  the book itself had many flaws, and though considered a classic work of literature, it was incredibly slow-paced and left the reader searching frantically for adrenaline to keep his or her heart beating.  Nevertheless the movie falls into this trap in a far worse way than the book; by the end, you seriously wonder what happened to the last two hours of your life.  The conclusion is unfulfilling at best.  You know precisely what will happen from about twenty minutes in, and it never changes.  No surprises whatsoever.  Even by today's low standards for cinema, this is pathetic.  I honestly cannot see why anyone would want to see this movie, and I've been pondering the positive reviews on amazon.com for hours.  It is not nearly as good as everyone else believes and certainly not worth eight dollars.
0895260131|4.0|The P.I.G. Guide to Islam, is a good overview of the religion, that doesn't fall into the trap of \\"it is a peaceful, religion taken over by a radical few.\\"  Instead it covers the long history of Islam, with multiple references and extracts from the Koran.   It is clearly written and well researched.  It should be part of any comparative religion study between Christianity and Islam.  It also provides a good historical basis for the Crusades and explains why they were critical in the survival of Europe.
B00KUS5YGC|5.0|Ironic that I received this set on the same day they announced the third movie would be a reboot. I have no problem with an all-female cast, (in fact I believe the next Resident Evil game should have an all-female cast) my problem is with the reboot concept. It would be more amazing to make a sequel to a 25 year old movie as a \\"passing the torch\\" story, which is sort of a reboot in and of itself, than to do a reboot (which anyone can do) and having to tell a different origin story.<br />Now, onto this set. GBII finally gets some respect, in the form of deleted scenes and interviews with Aykroyd and Reitman. Still, they could have included more deleted scenes, and Run DMC's \\"Ghostbusters\\" music video. All of the features for the first movie on the earlier Blu-ray are included, plus a few more, still, there are some deleted scenes that could have been included.<br />So in conclusion, enjoy these 2 comedy classics, their memory is going to be sullied.
B000AOEN2C|5.0|Just finished watching all 4 seasons. Blew me away. Definitely the best of ST to date. Lets hope this is not the end. <br /> <br />I have to admit the opening and closing music really let the show down badly. At least on DVD you can skip those bits. Its just way out of character for startrek. Its good music... but its definitely not right for the show. Even Ang (wife - not a fan) was shocked when she heard the opening/closing. I can see why fans were so bitterly disappointed. Actually in series 4 they do a alternative reality 2 episode show with alternate open/closing music. Its actully a much better match. If they stamped out new DVDs with an alternatve open/close music -- honestly I think I'd buy them :-) <br /> <br />Congratulations to everyone involved in producing the 4 season.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|This film has haunting music, great special effects, and terrific themes. The DVD has incredible extras. The menus are improved over the first version, and there are more deleted scenes. It could be the last TNG movie, but the door is open for sequels and crossovers with other Trek series. There is also a lot of character development. There's also a lot of mythology included, especially in regards to B-4 from TNG episode, \\"Inheritance.\\" I only wish they would have expanded the Romulan mythology more, by adding Tomalok or Sela or even Spock to the movie. Apparently, Denise Crosby wanted to be in the movie but writer John Logan couldn't make it work. Still, a must have for anyone who likes action movies. <br />
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Simply said this album is much better than Mezmerize.  I remember when i made my review for Mezmerize, but since then my opinions have dimmed down a bit, ESPECIALLY after hearing this.<br /><br />While Mezmerize was more party light themed, this album had darker, more meaningful, and more political lyrics, and by far was the heavier of the two.  The way that Hypnotized was produced, you can tell that its the second part of Mezmerize, but there is alot of difference otherwise.  Now, Daron haters...Sorry to say Daron still sings a ton on the album.<br /><br />I dont mind Darons singing, because im a fan of his stage antics.  I think the main reason why this album is better than its brother is that Mezmerize suffered from mediocrity.  Hypnotize (for the most part) dosent pull any punches- Its either a good or bad song.<br /><br />Attack - A fast riff blows the album into play, with the melodic verse, and a chorus that resembles \\"Prison Song\\"...But i like this song better.  And of course, its about attack (in war)!  This is MY personal favorite song, and the best opening song by System since Suite-Pee - 4.5/5<br /><br />Dreaming - This song also starts with a fast riff-type thing.  This song has a very heavy verse, but i think Serj's singing didnt blend too well with it.  I love the melodic intermission though \\"Someone kick me out of my mind/I hate these thoghts i cant deny\\" - 4/5<br /><br />Kill Rock N' Roll - One of the 2 songs that SOAD started playing on the Spring/Summer tour of '05 (That i didnt see :'()<br /><br />Hypnotize, and it was pretty good.  I actually like the live version better, but im fine with this version.  Apparently this song is about a bunny-rabbit that Daron ran over...He dedicated this song to it - 4/5<br /><br />Hypnotize - The title track of the album...I dont have anything against this song, its just not particularly one of my faves.  Its got a middle eastern type of begining and solo, combined with Aerials type riffs.  This isnt the only song that has hints of the old Aerials single on this album. - 3.5/5<br /><br />Stealing Society - And after the slow ending of Hypnotize, picks right back up with the heavy Stealing Society.  The lyrics aren't the greatest in the song, but the heavy guitar work is pretty cool.  Darons intrelude is nice and catchy like Dreaming. - 4/5<br /><br />Tentative - Starts off with a high pitched chord, and a heavy verse with Serj being rappish for the verses...Proving that he still has the fast tongue (probably not as fast as Sugar...He could hardly ever keep up with that song live).  The chorus' and Intrelude are the melodic parts repeating the line \\"Where do expect us to go when the bombs fall?\\".  In my opinion, this should be the next single, because it would fit in.  SOAD said in an interview something about \\"2 singles from Mez, 2 singles from Hyp, and then 1 more single from Mez\\".  The way i see it, they released 2 less heavier singles in a row, the last single from Mezmerize is more than likely to be \\"Lost In Hollywood\\", so this would be a good decision on their part. - 4/5<br /><br />U-Fig - The lack luster song on the album, and if anything, the filler before the huge \\"Holy Mountains\\" song.  It has nice heavy verses, but i dont really care for much of the music, or the lyrics. - 2.7/5<br /><br />Holy Mountains - Now this track just amazes me.  This is the other song (along side Kill Rock 'N Roll) thats been being played live since spring.  This is also the other song that has a resemblance of Aerials, but the main riff, and the lyrics being set at a more angry tone lead this track along.  Its also one of the longest System songs ever...I think it might be second longest to \\"Mind\\" from Self-Titled.  This song is about the mountains that Turkey claimed during the Armenian Genocide in the 1910's (SOAD are all Armenian-Americans). - 4.7/5<br /><br />Vicinity Of Oscenity - Quite possibly the craziest track on the album.  Lots of songs on Mezmerize had crazy lyrics, but suffered from mediocre music.  This song has FRIGGIN SPOONS, ok?  Er...Sorry...  Anywho, this song has heavy verses, and crazy lyrics about Banana Terracotta Pies, and holding babies.<br /><br />Oh yah, and the first song that Daron EVER used a Wah-Pedal. - 4/5<br /><br />Shes Like Heroin - The one track on the album i feel suffers from mediocrity...But its still enjoyable to listen to.  The lyrics about Whores, Heroin, and guys wearing little dresses.  Theres not much to say about it musically. - 3/5<br /><br />Lonely Day - Ok...The guitar work in this song is awesome...But Darons vocals in this song kills it.  Its basically about a lonely day...Kinda sounds like a Green Day song with Guns N' Roses influence.  The solo is the SECOND best solo Daron has ever done (Soil is #1).  Overall, the music saves it.  The song ends with a fimiliar noise we heard from Mezmerize, right before BYOB - 3.5/5<br /><br />Soldier Side - A sad, but cool clean riff starts this amazement off.  Soldier Side is obviously the second part to Soldier Side- Intro from Mezmerize.  The lyrics are amoung the most mature lyrics ive ever heard System Of A Down do.  A very emotional song, almost rock opera like...Besides for it being 3:40 and the lyrics actually having meaning.  The part that might catch people is the chorus \\"They were crying when their sons left/God is wearing black/Hes gone so far to find the hope/Hes never coming back\\".  Its all about soldiers about to die in battle.  The song ends with the fimiliat line \\"Welcome to the soldier side/There is no one here but me/People/All grow up to die/There is no one here but me\\", and then the guitar riff used for Soldier Side-Intro.  The guitar probably should have done an open strum to give it more of an ending feel, because it makes me feel like i could put BYOB right after it.  Other than that, AMAZING track - 5/5<br /><br />There you have it.  System has dominated 2005...Twice!  Good marketing skills too...No one buys a double album at once!<br /><br />Peace out.ad crazy lyrics, but suffered from mediocre music.   This song has FRIGGIN SPOONS, ok?  Er...Sorry...  Anywho, this song has heavy verses, and crazy lyrics about Banana Terracotta Pies, and holding babies.  <br />Oh yah, and the first song that Daron EVER used a Wah-Pedal. - 4/5 <br /> <br />Shes Like Heroin - The one track on the album i feel suffers from mediocrity...But its still enjoyable to listen to.

The guitar probably should have done an open strum to give it more of an ending feel, because it makes me feel like i could put BYOB right after it.   Other than that, AMAZING track - 5/5 <br /> <br />There you have it.   System has dominated 2005...Twice!  Good marketing skillstoo...No one buys a double album at once! <br />Peace out.
B000063DS1|5.0|This has got to be one of my favourite Boxed Sets of ALL TIME! I'm so glad they released the extended version with the outtakes & jams. Not only were The Band one of the most talented groups of our time but this set has them at top form with a host of guest players having a grand time. They are hot on this Thanksgiving night! <br /> <br />It was recorded in my town, San Francisco at one of my fave concert venues, Winterland.... I miss Winterland. I was at Thanksgiving dinner with family or I'd have dragged my brother to this gig for sure. Having the extended boxed set & the DVD are almost like going back in time & seeing The Band again.... <br /> <br />This is a must for even a casual fan. It's got great songs, great recording & those voices. I can't say enough about their voices. Man, could they sing! And, they sang high (my co-worker say's, yeah, they sang high, too,....) & beautiful harmonies.... You can't go wrong with this one.  <br /> <br />There's very few groups that can stand the test of time & these guys are definately one of 'em. Such a shame we won't be having a reunion with The Band until we pass over to the Other Side....
B000056JYC|4.0|Loved the album, love the cd as much. The cd cover is the same as the album cover but you get a booklet inside. The four extra tracks are great and the sound is much better. All around a very good package. Peter Frampton is still one the best guitar players/ composers still after all these years. Enjoy
B00001PE4D|3.0|Despite turning into an unintentional (?) comedy in its last 20 minutes, \\"Cruel Intentions\\" is worth watching. It is one more entry in a long line of films based on the Choderlos De Laclos novel \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\", this one is a modern teen update of the story with rich Manhatten teenagers playing roles originally calling for jaded French aristocrats.    It has been said that while teenagers once went to the movies to see adults making love, adults now go to the movies to see teenagers making love. This is not precisely the case with \\"Cruel Intentions\\", which is more like teenagers seeing adults playing teenagers making love. This is particularly glaring in the case of Selma Blair who was cast as the youngest character, Cecile. Talk about \\"13 Going On 30\\"! Blair actually looks older than Jennifer Garner and may have served as Garner's inspiration. Unfortunately the viewer is asked to accept this horrible miscasting, which leaves everyone embarrassed for Blair and hopeful after each scene that you have seen the last of her character.    Buffy is in this and while she is a \\"little long in the tooth\\" for her character, it is not quite as glaring. It was a fun role for her, similar to Rose McGowan's character in \\"Jawbreaker\\", although more sterile. They seem to have borrowed \\"Jawbreaker's\\" ending as well (probably just a coincidence), although they don't do it as well because Buffy isn't any competition for McGowan in the talent and sexy departments. It was a mistake to end things differently than the earlier \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\" films although many viewers will find the ending's unintentional humor a welcome relief from the hyped up melodrama.    The main story is the reason I can recommend \\"Cruel Intentions\\". A down-to-earth Reese Witherspoon plays the new girl (and thankfully looks about the right age) in town. She has written a nationally published essay entitled \\"Why I Choose to Wait.\\"  Sebastian (played by her real life husband Ryan Phillippe) has abet that he can put an end to her waiting. They have very good chemistry and all their scenes work very well.    The reasonable response to Witherspoon's recent movie roles is to dismiss her as the worst actress of her generation. But if you check out her performances here and in \\"Election\\" and \\"The Man In The Moon\\" you will find that she was once a promising talent. And with her \\"Walk the Line\\" performance she has begun to get her career back on track.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I watched Live 8 on TV & on the internet. I could not wait until this DVD set came out. I bought it the day it came out. They did a great job with the DVD's, the video & sound are great & the fact that it has a 5.1 DTS sound setting is great for my entertainment center.  <br />The lineup is also great. I heard some bands that I have never even heard of that I am now a fan of. <br />The best part is of course PINK FLOYD's awesome set. I could not believe what I was seeing when I first saw it live & now to see it with the great sound quality is just amazing. They are one of the few bands that had every one of their songs on the DVD. I have been telling people that it is 2 1/2 DVD's of great opening bands for PINK FLOYD. <br />My only complaint is that they did not have Green Days cover of Queens \\"We are the champions\\". I felt that they did a great job with that cover & it should of been on the DVD. I did not let this change my rating though, it is still a great DVD that I think any rock fan should definitely own. <br />
B00000DHRX|5.0|I love George Michael, what a beautiful yet tragically underrated voice.  It really bothers me how many people seem to dismiss our George, for any variety of small-minded reasons, because he is such a wonderful singer and entertainer.   I guess that we here in America can forgive our entertainers for having absolutely no talent (think Britney Spears, the Simpson sisters, many rap artists, etc), but we apparently can't forgive them for having private lives which should not be any of our concern.  Too bad, many are the talented who go relatively unnoticed by the bourgeois masses.  I guess that in this day and age it is something to be proud of, really. <br /> <br />Anyway, I have had this 2-disc collection since it came out in 1998 and have listened to it constantly ever since.  It is broken into two separate moods; the downtempo ballad-heavy first disk titled \\"for the heart\\", and the beat driven dance-y second disk titled \\"for the feet\\".  Both are absolute winners.  The first, as could be expected, will take you in and pull firmly on the heartstrings.  The second will scrape you off the couch and onto the dancefloor. <br /> <br />All of the songs on both disks are old, favorite friends of any self-respecting George Michael fan, and all are absolutely amazing, but some of my personal favorites include the following: <br /> <br />For the Heart: Father Figure, Careless Wisper, Kissing a Fool, I Can't Make You Love Me (almost puts Bonnie Raitt to shame), Heal the Pain, and Praying for Time <br /> <br />For the Feet: Outside, Fastlove, Freedom 90, Star People 97, Killer/Papa Was a Rolling Stone, Spinning the Wheel, I Knew You Were Waiting for Me, Somebody to Love <br /> <br />If you are considering this purchase, don't hesitate, especially at this price.  Also be sure to check out the DVD of the same name for the videos of all of these songs - a feast for the eyes as well as the ears.  I love the Fastlove video - so vivid, sexy and decadent.  Also be certain to pick up acopy of his most recent album, \\"Patience\\", another can't-be-missed from George and, if it is to be believed, the last.   <br /> <br />I really hope that George doesn't hang it up, it would be such an incredible loss to his current, and potentially future, fans.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Love it! <br />Panic! At the Disco is a refreshingly different band in a day full of copycat rubbish. While they do sound *familiar* to some other acts out, there is one thing that separates them from the rest - dance beats. \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is an album of pure dance/rock energy belted out by a bunch of guys who are still too young to even drink. <br />A definite buy for fans of Fall Out Boy, Motion City Soundtrack, and the like simply because it offers something that is really unique to the whole emo/pop/rock scene.
B000AA305M|4.0|4.5 stars - 5 stars is reserved for the likes of \\"White Ladder\\". <br /> <br />I, like many of his newer fans, fell in love with David Gray on his masterpiece album (in my opinion, anyway) \\"White Ladder\\".  That album has not left my sight since the day that I bought it.  \\"Please Forgive Me\\" and \\"Babylon\\", in addition to all of the others on that album, are constantly on my playlist.  I never thought that David Gray would be able to produce another album that would capture my undying affection the way that \\"White Ladder\\" did. <br /> <br />I am very happy to report how wrong I was.  While I also loved his album \\"A New Day a Midnight\\" which followed \\"While Ladder\\", I still found myself travelling backwards to my first love. Luckily, \\"Life in Slow Motion\\" brings me back to the present.  This album is absolutely beautiful.  The musicianship and David's voice are all in top form.  The music manages to sound sparse yet dense all at the same time.  The guitar, the piano, and David's voice all share centerstage to great effect without one overwriting the other. <br /> <br />Give \\"Alibi\\", \\"Lately\\", \\"The One I Love\\", \\"Ain't No Love\\", and \\"Disappearing World\\" a listen and see if you aren't transported into David Gray's world.  This an absolute must for any David Gray fan or for anyone who longing for a little taste of Brit-folk-pop-tronica.  Tired, like myself, of Chris Martin's self-important whining with Coldplay?  Check this out. <br /> <br />As far as the copy protection is concerned, I just want to add that I have not had any problem with it.  Is it at times tedious and annoying to deal with?  Yes, absolutely, but I find that little finesse is required to circumvent it's pathetic roadblocks.  Mind you, I am NOT saying that I am copying the material or am distributing it in any way.  I just mean that I have not had any problem getting it loaded onto my computer, transferred into iTunes and onto my iPod.
B00007LTIL|5.0|When I first listened to this CD, I was in Japan. I went for two weeks, and my host brother renterd American Beaty for me. At first I liked it, but I wasn't crazy about it. But the more I listened to it, the more I realized how great it really is. Just give it a chance, and I guarentee you'll love it.
B000001FTD|3.0|Sticky (and repetitive) riffs + irritating vocals + forgettable solos = Among the Living <br />Funny, but not very produced. <br />I prefer more produced Anthrax records like Stomp 442.
B00005J6UP|5.0|My children range in age from 15 to 28 and we have been watching this movie together since it first came out on video. We never get tired of the humor and in fact have watched it together so many times that most of us can quote all of the really good lines. The language isn't great, but how many movies (yes, even \\"family friendly\\" movies) have good language these days. It's no worse than most PG rated movies. The story of friendship and loyalty is a great life lesson for kids. I give this movie two thumbs up and call it a true family classic.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This has got to be my favorite musical of all time. The singers are absolutely amazing and the music is so interesting. Like nothing you have heard before.
B000006TRV|5.0|It was that fateful day when Roger Waters spat at fans in response to the disturbances they were creating that the magnificent concept of a \\"Wall\\" of isolation between the band and the fans came to mind.  Waters's brilliant lyrics take you on the journey of a tragic rock star named Pink and the terrible crises that he confronts in his life.  The emotion, expresson, and magnificence of this album cannot be expressed in words. However, that's just the songwriting.  Pink Floyd doesn't fail to impress us here in any way, shape, or form. <br /> <br />Vocally, the combined vocals of David Gilmour and Roger Waters combine to create some of the best vocal performances in rock (The Trial).  The guitar work is perhaps at it's all time peak with such solos as on Another Brick In The Wall, Hey You, Young Lust, and most of all, Comfortably Numb, a solo which can even rival Stairway To Heaven in terms of emotion and greatness.  The keyboard work, though a little weaker than previous efforts (such as Wish You Were Here) is as essential to Pink Floyd's sound as ever.  Waters and Mason are a solid and dynamic rhythm section throughout. <br /> <br />Though some tracks on this album are weaker than others, it's a concept album and these tracks are for the sake of the album.  That's not to say that they aren't highlights.  Another Brick In The Wall remains to this day to be a powerful anthem, Hey You is one of the most emotionally moving pieces I've ever heard, Young Lust is catchy and has a great beat, Mother is another amazing track, and Comfortably Numb, possibly the best on the album, remains to be one of my favorite songs of all time. <br /> <br />This isn't even Pink Floyd's greatest album (Dark Side of the Moon) which just goes to show how amazing they really were.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this album.  It is just sheer brilliance throughout.
B000BTJDG2|5.0|Unlike formulaic horror movies such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer and all their hundreds of sequels, this movie both scares you and makes you think. <br />First and foremost it's a movie of ideas but that also uses visceral effects to make you squirm. And that's the scariest combination of all. <br /> <br />When all we're usually fed is a brainless diet of horror movies where you're never unnerved, simply bored, this movie should be cherished.  <br /> <br />It's a very imaginative mixing of genres (horror and courtroom). The clash between the scientific evidence and the beliefs of the church dramatized well and intelligently.
B000002UAX|5.0|This one of the longest and also one of the most messy and scattered albums ever made and thats one of the reasons why it has never been forgotten.  The Beatles decided to depart somewhat from the psychedelic music of, \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\", and, \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", to return to some of the more basic Rock & Roll songcraft as well as to try new and ambitious things. <br /> <br />This album has almost everything that existed at that time as well as things that had yet to come.  There's pure Rock & Roll, Pop, Folk, Hard Rock, Proto-Punk, Comedy Rock, Blues Rock, and even some Heavy Metal and Country.  There's almost no structure to the composition of the record.  \\"Bungalow Bill\\", runs right into, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", yet the two songs have nothing in common.  \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", is sandwiched in the middle of, \\"Yer Blues\\", and, \\"Monkey\\".  \\"Long, Long, Long,\\", is the album's quietest song yet it comes immediately after the album's loudest song, \\"Helter Skelter\\". <br /> <br />The song opens with the political satire of, \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.\\".  A somewhat parody of The Beach Boys's, \\"California Girls\\", this is one of the Beatles' best album openers.  Very loud with its Pro-Soviet Union lyrics it runs right into the much more mellower, \\"Dear Pruedence\\".  These songs have nothing in common yet the transition seems very natural.  \\"Glass Onion\\", is a take on the Beatles' cult itself with its Paul is dead hoax lyrics and errie string solo at the end.  The next two songs are pure comedy but the album does a 180 with the George Harrison ballad, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\".  Featuring a classic solo by Eric Clapton this is one of the finest moments for both him and George.  \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\", is basicly a sexually explicit mini medley. Again it makes no sense at all but then again nothing on this album does.  \\"Martha My Dear\\", and, \\"I'm So Tired\\", are classics but then comes, \\"Blackbird which is beyond classic.  A very simple acoustic folk song that outranks the most complex techno garbage made nowdays, Paul speaks out to anybody who is injured (physicaly or emotionaly) and tells them to try their best to stay alive and keep going.  He wrote this after hearing about the civil rights movement in Alabama and since women are called, \\"birds\\", in England its a reasonable conclusion that he wrote this with an African American Woman in mind.  \\"Piggies\\", and, \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", are stupid but fun and, \\"I Will\\", and, \\"Julia\\", are great acoustic ballad.  The worst song on this album and possibly the worst song the Beatles' would ever write is, \\"Why Don't We Do It On The Road\\".  I would expect a \\"Gansta\\" rapper from nowdays to write something like this but the Beatles???   <br /> <br />There's more fun on disc two.  \\"Birthday\\", is a classic party anthem and, \\"Yer Blues\\", as its name suggests is the Fab Four's best attempt at a Blues number.  There's more great folk with Mccartney's, \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", and Harrison's, \\"Long, Long, Long\\",  \\"Monkey\\", and, \\"Helter Skelter\\", are the boy's best attempt at punk and heavy metal.  \\"Monkey\\", opens up with a classic Stone's riff and contains crazy Ramones type lyrics.  \\"Helter Skelter\\", is the Beatles' most crazy, loud, and out of control numbers they ever made.  \\"Sexy Sadie\\", and, \\"Savoy Truffle\\" aren't bad but, \\"Revolution 9\\", is just absurd. Its just eight minutes of noise!  \\"Honey Pie\\", and, \\"Cry Baby Cry\\", are pretty good and Ringo Star gives two of his best songs with, \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", and the closer, \\"Good Night\\".  The version of, \\"Revolution 1\\", is inferior and boring when compared to the hard rocker of the single version. <br /> <br />At 90 minutes long this is not an easy listen whatsoever.  Its a sloppy mess but that what makes so likable.  If you want to see the Beatles at their most experimental stage get this album and listen to the whole thing as hard as it may be.
0684135051|5.0|True, this is not a \\"first\\" knitting book - you should be comfortable with casting on and knitting (no purling though) to take advantage of all the amazing info E-Zim has to offer here. <br /> <br />That said, this book will revolutionize your knitting. You will be amazed how simple it is to make sweaters of several varieties, and what's more, you will design them yourself! E-Zim shows how very simple Any Sweater is in its basic design, then she lets you go and express yourself as you see fit. <br /> <br />I'm a relatively new knitter, but armed with this book I have made several gorgeous sweaters including a very impressive looking Fair Isle - which is so embarrassingly easy to do I'm almost reluctant to take praise on the sweater. Almost!
B0001IN0DA|5.0|Cena vs. Big SHow <br />Decent big vs. small match to start the show off with but not the quality of WM21's opener. Still very watchable and entertaining however. <br />RATING: 74/100 <br /> <br />World tag Title Fatal Fourway <br />Nice fast paced action with some hindrances that include it being a few minutes short and not enough real action. Still a good tag match <br />RATING: 72/100 <br /> <br />Christian vs. Y2J <br />A mattch that had a great variety of all the good things required in a good mid-card match. The ending was perhaps not as good as if it could have been a clean victory, however that doesn't disturb this rating at all and still a highly enjoyable good wrestling match. <br />RATING: 84/100 <br /> <br />Rock & Sock vs. Evolution <br />I found this match very entertaining and edge of the seat action. There were a few usual tag moments which tended to be slightly boring, but on the whole very entertaining and some good moves to finish off with. Close falls and a good RKO by Orton helped too. <br />RATING: 82/100 <br /> <br />Lingerie MAtch <br />Although there was nothing special at all in this match the beginning and the changing from evening gown to lingerie was exciting, enjoyable and \\"fun\\". The rating for this one is basically purely on entertainment because of the lingerie. <br />RATING: 70/100 <br /> <br />Cruiserweight Open <br />Here is a truly spectacular display of what the cruiserweights are capable of. This match was very fast paced and constant high-flying action all match. Some breath-taking moves and edge of the seat moments made this 10 minute match my pick of the mid-card. Obviously my only gripe is is the time which took away a high 80 or a 90 from the match. <br />RATING: 85/100 <br /> <br />Brock Lesnar vs. Bill Goldberg <br />Main thing about this match is the great psychology. For me it was edge of the seat stuff when they decided to lock up and very entertaining. Some close nearfalls after a finisher also helped. The only problem here is that the match was quite slow paced and yes, this match was not up to either of these men's true potentisl. Still a highly enjoyable, intensen match though.  <br />RATING: 82/100 <br /> <br />WWE Tag Team Title Fatal Fourway <br />Very short tag match that had very few big moments. Nothing special for a high in the card tag match. Nice to see the Too Cool dance by Rikishi and Scotty Too Hotty, very entertaining! <br />RATING: 67/100 <br /> <br />Victoria vs. Moll y Holly <br />Not a bad wrestling match that I though could get a very high score right up unitil a pinfall came out of absolutely nowhere! I was sitting back and all of a sudden the beel rings and the match is over. Definitely hindered a decent wrestling match. <br />RATING: 63/100 <br /> <br />Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guererro <br />Truly oustanding match from start to finish! There was intense mat wrestling from both of these 2 technical experts and great high-flying from Eddie. Some nail biting nearfalls and intense ankle locks really made this match a classic tah ti have remebered since last year. Outstanding match that just could have been 5 minutes longer <br />RATING: 93/100 <br /> <br />Undertaker vs. Kane <br />Great entrance from the Phenom and match nothing much to speak of other than it basically being quite good not great. Still great to see the real Undertaker back! <br />RATING: 77/100 <br /> <br />Benoit vs. HBK vs. HHH <br />Absolutely amazing match that had it all. Length perfect, ending perfect and variuous high-flying moves to make this one of the best main events I have ever seen. I think that it is the best main event that has been (other than HBK vs. HHH [HIAC]) on since I have started watching. Superb <br />RATING: 95/100 <br /> <br />79% - Absolutely terrific Wrestlemania that was a complete show with 7 title defenses and every single one of them was well done. Capped off by two near perfect main events. <br />Outstanding PPV! <br />
B0000000LI|5.0|I see here lot critics blaming Yanni for being reptitious. I think they are simply Deaf or dont know how to identify patterns or simply they cant do anything else apart from critisizing. Yanni's music has varied patterns, not same and they are introduced at approriate beats in his music. Even beethoven would have appreciated it.Anyway this is a must own cd.
B0006L16N8|5.0|.......\\"I'm on the top, I can't get back.\\"  This is one of the lines from \\"Square One\\" The 1st track on this album.  If you are a fan of both U2 and Coldplay, which I am,  it will be impossible not to listen to X&Y and not think of U2.  The reason I chose the line above is because it mirrors a line from U2's \\"Zooropa\\":<br /><br />\\"And I have no compass/And I have no map/And I have no reasons to get back.\\"<br /><br />Coldplay has obviously spent a lot of time dissecting Edge's guitar playing; almost every track on this album has the expansive, helicopterish chiming of the U2 axeman.  That's not to say this is not an awesome album.  It most definitely is. There is actually only one track that doesn't fit with the rest and that is \\"The Hardest Part\\".  Not a bad song, but owes more to Tom Petty and R.E.M. than U2.  Coldplay spends a lot of time reaching for the heavens and outer space on X&Y, and most of the time they get there.  Great album.

0307276902|3.0|I found this book to be disappointing after all the hype. Granted the guy had been through hell but his writing style was terrible. I was glad to see that he did let people know that AA is not the only path to recovery from addictions.
B0007GAERG|3.0|Despite how much I hate Mariah, and would love to give her a 1-star rating, I can't. My friend made me sit and listen to this album the whole way through, and despite her cheap ways of getting more money by the releasing the Platinum Editions for this album (Check out my 1-star ratings.), there are a few good songs. The singles all seemed to catch my attention somehow, especially Get Your Number. Another stand out track was Say Somethin', which featured some good guest vocals from Snoop Dogg. The other songs were either mediocre, or really bad. One song I didn't like at all was One And Only. Mariah was trying to progress something angry into somewhat of a sweet song, and it didn't work. Futhermore, Joy Ride was slow and boring. Stay The Night, Circles, Your Girl, I Wish You Knew and Fly Like A Bird are all average, or below-average, tracks. Do I recommend it? No.
0684830515|5.0|Hemingway's best and most succinctly character driven novel. Profiles the romantic angst of its protoganist all to no avail. Missing his manhood due to war atrocities, Jake Barnes is left helpless as Brett, his ideal woman sashes her way around post-WWI Mediterranean Spain. The quintesential lost generation novel, The Sun Also Rises makes one long not only for wine-spirited Spain sunsets, but for distance-land romantic get-aways. Take the reader back to a unique time-period, mentality, and geographic land - scintillating and succulent to all the senses.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|\\"Playing the Angel\\", Depeche Mode's most recent music effort is a lyrical journey filled with \\"pain and suffering in various tempos\\". Despite the fact that a majority of this record seems to be suspended  in a state of wretched melancholy, there are quite a few songs that deserve recongition as truly inspirational standout tracks. High points include: \\"a pain that i'm used to\\", \\"john the revelator\\", \\"suffer well\\", \\"precious\\", \\"i want it all\\", and \\"lilian\\". Now...this is not to say that the rest of the album is undeserving of any praise; to the contrary, all of the songs thrive in riveting sounds and beautifully haunting vocals...this is a must have for all Depeche Mode fans and an obvious departure from the group's previous work with \\"Exciter\\"..... After a few careful listens I must say I recommend it...
0517548232|5.0|In this text, Hazlitt surveys several economic policies and analyzes their full long-term effects on economic production or efficiency.  This includes the relationship between wages, prices, and production, government subsidies, international tariffs, different tax brackets and incentives, machine and war economies, commodity pricing, minimum wage laws, union membership, and inflationary vs. deflationary factors.  Written with clear and concise sentences and precise examples, Hazlitt does an excellent job at presenting a utilitarian and rational economic model for government policies, as well as individual appreciation of wealth.  Well done.
B00005ATQF|3.0|The beginning of this movie is great. It seemed very realistic and showed the horror of traing for the military. The drill seargent gave a great performance and so did private pyle. But, the second half of the movie which was in Vietnam wasn't that good at all. The action was very boring and the scenes seemed like they were just thrown together. I excpected a lot more from this movie.
0812932293|5.0|From his 16 year old days of publishing a Student publication, smoking spliffs, and squatting with 20 peers in a London tenement, to his around the world balloon attempts, Richard Branson has never done things the conventional way. Starting off with a description of the rise of Virgin Records with the signing of acts such as the Sex Pistols, Oldfield's Tubular Bells, and Boy George, and ending with the entrepreneurial conglomerate branded \\"Virgin I Rule the World\\" - airlines, cola, cell phones, retail, publishing - Branson's journey is a swashbuckling treat. With his fun-loving personality and taste for adventure, Branson corales the reader into his exploratory view of the world.<br /><br />Among the amazing descriptions here are his break-up concerning the tensions surrounding the balance between his business and his significant other at his home-life or in this case boat life, getting busted for illegaly selling music tax-duty free, descriptions of the jam out music sessions at the Virgin castle, and his harrowing life and death experiences in breaking and attempting to break world records in sailing and hot air balloon racing.<br /><br />Branson and Hugh Hefner have to be the most idolized men who have been able to mix business and pleasure, with the equation always leaning toward pleasure. Branson will be able to reminisce about his incredible life in his twilight years on his own private island in the Pacific - if only we could be so fortunate.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|This release is definitely better than the first half of System of a Down's double-album project this year, the horrifically misguided Mezmerize. Hypnotize partially redeems the project with a generally stronger set of songs, but releasing the new material on two albums has had middling results at best. Like all double albums, this material could be boiled down to an incredible single album, but as a double it's just bloated and unfocused. Eliminating stone-cold garbage like \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Old School Hollywood\\" from Mezmerize, and \\"Kill Rock n' Roll\\" and \\"She's Like Heroin\\" from Hypnotize, would have made SOAD's recent product look much more focused and hard-hitting.<br /><br />As for Hypnotize itself, SOAD's strengths are exercised a little better this time, especially in a commanding trio of tracks in the center of the album &#8211; \\"Tentative,\\" \\"U-Fig,\\" and the band's most haunting look yet at the Armenian genocide of the early 20th century, \\"Holy Mountains.\\" Unfortunately, the momentum is then broken by the stupid \\"Vicinity of Obscenity.\\" Of course, the band uses such nonsense as an artistic statement, and they've even done it successfully in the past, but here the point just doesn't come across. Meanwhile, the useless \\"Lonely Day\\" proves why SOAD should not be doing ballads, though the full version of \\"Soldier Side\\" can nearly match \\"Aerials\\" as the greatest of SOAD's powerful slow-burners. But the overall lesson of this double-album project is that the efforts of SOAD (and particularly Daron Malakian) to expand their sound are not leading to true advancements, with a real shortage of their former triumphs in breakneck songwriting and fearsome chops.<br /><br />Malakian has earned respect as an outstanding songwriter, but in his baffling drive to advance his own less-than-stellar skills on vocals and guitar, he is egotistically wasting the incredible talents of his bandmates. The relentless rhythm section of Shavo Odadjian and John Dolmayan has been pushed to the background, while Serj Tankian is now crushingly underutilized. Metal singers who can truly sing are terribly rare these days, and Tankian's incredibly inventive phrasing and terrifying delivery make him one of the best ever at forcing the listener to really think about what he's doing. It is downright insulting to watch Tankian be reduced to a fraction of lead vocals, and to have to listen to him singing backup to the far weaker vocals of Malakian, whose whiny and reedy voice is seriously damaging the power of SOAD's material. In the future, Malakian must retreat back to his core strengths as a songwriter, so the band as a whole can exercise its incredible power once again.

0802130208|5.0|Enchanting tail of the travails of one Ignatious O' Reilly. The continuously alienated Ignatious seeks through a variety of pauper-like jobs to find his freedom from his mother and overweight physical bearing. Farce after farce reveals itself as Ignatious becomes a victim of the bureaucratized, run-down, corrupt, Southern capitalist system of New Orleans. Ironic is the tone and tome of the book, as perhaps the same sluggishness that characterized many of the characters of the book was present in the dense, muggy climate of New Orleans pre-Katrina.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I have over 50 of the most popular Christmas albums and CD's ever made, and year after year this album continues to be my favorite.  The arrangements by Karen's producer brother, Richard, are simply magnificent, and different than any others I've heard of the classic songs of the season.  There are also a few that will be new to you, but will quickly become classics in your house.  <br /> <br />And Karen's voice....what needs to be said?  It is so moving on every single song, whether it's happy, soulful, or in between.  She has the most hauntingly beautiful voice I've ever heard. <br /> <br />I play this album over and over all season long.  It's simply the best, and brings me joy with every playing.  You will NOT regret buying it.
0140042520|5.0|On the peaks of the High Siera, Kerouac's narrator, Japhy Ryder explores the inner nuances of one's thought processes and being, away from the hustle and bustle of the Bay area's consternative environs. Changing thinking along with the weather and seasons, Japhy attends his attention to everyone ounce of his being, becomming one and all with his environment. Achieving moments of Zen purity, Kerouac is able to pinpoint the bountiful beauty and vitality of mother nature and of one's relation to it. A great read showing the inner exploration and sanctity with which Kerouac grounded his Bohemian lifestyle.
1573225517|5.0|Rob is a teenager trapped in a thirty-five year-old man's body, or rather, he's a thirty- five year-old man who still thinks he's a teenager. Instead of moving on in life, he obsesses over past relationships and why they went wrong, beats himself up over his sexual abilities, and practically stalks his ex-girlfriend, whom he claims is responsible, at the moment, for everything that is wrong in his life. Like someone who hasn't yet acquired the maturity that comes with age, Rob prides himself in who he sleeps with, is incapable of having a real conversation with his mother, and considers his life a reflection of pop music. Though not all men are young in everyday behavior, they are young at heart, and the heart always plays a role at one time or another in life. This is a book for women to read to learn why men do the things they do. It is a book for men for the same reason.
0156027321|4.0|The epic journey of Pi and his raft, lion, compatriot Richard Parker is the ultimate test of faith. Matching only the most heroic battles of will (exploration of North Pole, climb of Mt. Everest) in real life, the novel is a vast cacophony of sights, smells, and sounds that blend together for several months along a 27 foot stretch of raft. Oscillating between feelings of comaraderie and predatorial death, Pi and Richard eke out a turbulent existence as the life saving raft drifts along the horizonless Pacific. Ingeniously adapting safety and survival measures, Pi shows the knack of a black-belted Eagle Scout. Whether it's food or water provisions, or emotional warning signals or distance measures of Richard, Pi is able to navigate and fine-tune the balancing act before making mainland for the 1st time.<br /><br />Many things are left unanswered and many things to be explored as to the reality vs. dream-like haze of various events from the capsize to various spottings of environmental objects. In the spirit of The Old Man and the Sea and epic real-life recounts such as Krakauer's \\"Into the Wild\\", this novel is an epic sea-fraring adventure well adapted to the written format.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This CD...sucks. The lyrics are bland, the songs seem a bit whiny and fake-voiced, the guitars suck and so do the drums. It is the worst album ever, and the fact that the songs are all interlinked makes it even worse. <br /> <br />Its also incredibly hypocritical. American Idiot and Holiday are 2 of the most hypocritical songs ever, American Idiot whining about mainstream media when they ARE mainstream media, and Holiday claiming that they are outlaws. <br /> <br />We didn't know signing a contract and selling out would make one an outlaw, and thats because it doesn't. The only way Green Day would ever be what they claim to be in Holiday is if they sung \\"MTV Get Off the Air!\\" at the MTV music video awards. <br /> <br />The rest of the songs seem to have been redone or something, so the vocals sound disjointed from it. It increases the annoying factor by 10%. Some of the songs are just plain stupid and emo. <br /> <br />Like Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and Wake Me Up When September Ends. <br /> <br />Anyone who likes Boulevard of Broken Dreams should get a Boulevard of Broken Face. Wake Me Up When September Ends is the most repetitive song I have ever heard. <br /> <br />In short- do not buy this CD..... It will ruin your life and kill your children and make God want to smite all of humanity.
B00005JOHU|5.0|Nicolas Cage delivers another smashing performance as Yuri, a gun runner who goes from small time arms dealing to supplying whole armies with instruments of death and destruction. <br /> <br />Cage is amazing in Lord of War as always. The genious behind Cage's acting comes from the fact that though we know his character is the embodiement of evil and that we SHOULD despise him, we dont. Its because of his character's wit, charisma, and intelligence. Intelligence stemming from the self knowledge that Yuri has; in knowing and understanding himself and ultimately in realizing he can't do a damn thing to change who he is. <br /> <br />This is why I loved this movie. It strayed from the Scarface plot formulae that movies like BLOW and other tales of The Rise and Fall of Some Power Hungry Fool stayed true to. In the last 10 minutes of the movie it dove into the realm of Shaymalan, where the unexpected twist took even me by surprise. And by the end of the movie, I saw what Lord of War was truly about. A critique of the way in which our world works, social commentary meets hollywood ala Hotel Rwanda, and an entertaining thrill ride thrown in for kicks.

B00028HBKC|4.0|Had no great desire to watch this movie but I bought/watched it to support Mel and all others who had a hand in it. As to the violence in the movie. Yes it is viloent but from our knowledge of Roman history and what the Bible tells us of the last 12 hours of Christ's human life, viloent is what it would have been. I am going to give it 4 stars for the attempt to stick with historical accounts. It loses one star for giving in to changes in the story/script a tiny bit to political correctness (you know, the \\"open minded people\\"). Is not easy to watch but as said it is dealing with a viloent time. Many will watch this with the attitude that Gibson was cashing in on this story. I would remind before watching to keep in mind that Gibson was turned down by all studios for this project but because he believed in the story being put to film he was willing to do it himself, to risk most all he had in this world to seeing it be made. Many will dislike this movie for that reason only. There is no greater divider than Christ. Those that Love Him will want to see this movie in hopes of knowing Him better. Those who do not love Him will ridicule.....Kind of like what Christ said would happen.
B00005JO1P|5.0|I saw the movie last night and enjoyed it as much as any movie I've seen in a long time.However, my enjoyment must be tempered with the fact that I have been an admirer of Cash from the beginning. I first saw him in concert in Montreal in 1969 which by the way,was a tour where he brought along The Statlers.I have most of his music and have read a number of books about him.He was a legend at that time and already had most of his hard times behind him,but his legend continued to grow right up to the end.<br />  Being a Country Music fan for 60 years,I have had a lot of favourites but when all's said and done Cash, in my opinion, is the best of the best;and there have been a lot of great artists<br />over the years.There is nobody that even comes close,except maybe Hank Williams Sr. but the fact that his life was cut so short at 29,and Cash 's lasted so much longer,makes the difference.Even Cash,as great as he was,never accomplished as much in any short period as did Williams.To me, it's unimaginable what Williams would have done if he had lived as long as Cash.<br />  All that said and done,how does one tell the story of Johnny Cash in a 2 hour movie or even a book? The answer is simply,you can't.<br />  What this movie does, is give a snapshot of his youth,a brief glance at his Air Force days,a quick summary of the early days at Sun Records,then a fairly detailed look at his interest in and proposal of marriage to June Carter.How exactly true the details are really don't matter much.The bottom line is that June Carter was the strength that held JR together and gave him the will to continue and become the great success that he was.The foundation of that strengh was faith and love. We saw it blossom and show itself all through the years;but never more on display than when together they sang \\"Jackson\\",way back in those days portrayed in the movie, as well as every time they appeared over the years.<br />  The movie ends with June accepting John's proposal during a concert at Massey Hall,here in Toronto.Although one might argue,I believe that was the real beginning of Cash becoming<br />the legend he did.Had June not been there for John,he might well have mirrored the the destruction of Williams.<br />  So,what this movie does,rather than tell the whole life and times of Johnny Cash,it centers in on that brief period where Cash was on the edge of perdition,things could have gone either way,and probably the wrong way,and it was the union of June and John that tipped the scales.<br />  This movie is excellent in showing the single factor that had the biggest inpact on John's life;not the songs he wrote,the concerts he performed,the causes he championed,the people he loved and helped,the image he portrayed;nothing comes close to the love they had for each other and their faith in God.<br />  If you are a fan of Cash,this is a movie you will not want to miss.here in Toronto.Although one might argue,I believe that was the real beginning of Cash becoming   the legend he did.Had June not been there for John,he might well have mirrored the the destruction of Williams.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Some friends, who refuse to watch any sci-fi shows but this one, recommended it to me. At first I was suspicious, but after about the 4th episode I had decided that this was a very good show. I like the idea of a space western (star trek was supposed to be one, but instead opted for something more intelligent...) that is done in an interesting and intelligent manner. The characters are strong, and the way they develop and interact over the unfortunately brief 14-episode run is great. <br />The premise of a 'darker' future devoid of ANY alien races, poverty, and earth ruled corruptly is interesting and done pretty well. I also like the idea of our heroes being amoral thieves. <br />However, there is also a core of people (some of my friends among them) who are making the bold claim that this is greatest and best sci-fi show EVER. Of course, the people saying that have not seen any sci-fi shows but this one. There's nothing that makes this the best show ever, by any means.  <br />The storylines, for example, are nice and develop the characters well. However, they aren't the most original, and if you've seen much of any Star Trek for example, you'll realize that these do resemble some things done before.  <br />Just a word of advice, don't listen to the chorus of people saying \\"Firefly is much better than Star Trek\\" (who coincidentally have not ever seen more than 1 episode of any Star Trek series.) If you've seen a good deal of the four Star Trek shows (Enterprise not included of course) or Babylon 5 you'll enjoy this, but will most definitely not be shocked by the plotlines or proclaim it \\"the best show ever.\\" Instead, approach this show with an open mind, and you'll most likely be somewhat surprised by it and enjoy it. <br />Also, the Serenity movie is also quite good, but again, it's not exactly \\"the best show ever.\\"
0380789035|4.0|As a person who has dedicated their life to studying various religions, faiths and mythologies, I was thoroughly entertained by the way Gaiman weaved various deities and mythological figures into his novel. With this said, it is easy to understand how someone without a working knowledge of this sort of thing would get bogged down in the seemingly trivial details.<br /><br />There were some aspects of the ending of the book which I would have liked to be a little more fleshed out before coming to the \\"conclusion\\". It seemed to me that if the character of Shadow were to be continued in another novel (or a series of novels, if needed), Gaiman could tie up many of the loose ends and make \\"American Gods\\" a much richer novel in the light of further development.<br /><br />All in all, a good read with engaging characters and enjoyable prose.

B000BJS4SU|2.0|John is a decent (although obviously \\"taught\\") guitar player. the songs on this album come off as formulaic and unremarkable.  As mentioned earlier his vocals are way too fluffy to give weight to songs of this nature .

I know he has passion for the music, but i dont feel he has the soul to do it justice.
B00005JO1J|5.0|I saw the movie in a beautiful theater in downtown San Francisco on the Saturday after Thanksgiving and was surprised to find so few people in the movie theater--maybe 75 of us, and the theater could have fit 500.  I wonder if some of the lukewarm reviews haven't influenced people's decisions to go to RENT.  Hope not, for I'm here to tell you, this movie is dynamite and IMHO much, much better than the play.  For one thing, in the movie you can hear every word, even with the increased rock instrumentation, for hundreds of sound experts have worked their magic and made sure that even people underwater could hear every single syllable; whereas on stage, it depended from night to night what percentage of the lyrics were going to be coming across the temperamental sound system of the Nederlander (NYC).<br /><br />I did miss Daphne Rubin-Vega who was incomparably sexy and chilling as Mimi, but I never believed her being in love, and Rosario Dawson looked like she was just 'playing' at being bad and underneath she was ready to fall in love as soon as she saw Roger through the window.  Her scenes of addiction are captured in the movie effectively, in a rpaid montage that might disconcert some rentheads but will, I think, be easily understood by those new to the show.<br /><br />Yes, some of the actors looked older than 20 somethings.  But we forget that most of those who died of AIDS in the 1989-90 period were actually in their 30s.  What's the big deal?  To me, Angel's fate is all the more sad because he seemed to be healthy for so long and then, all of a sudden, well, any more would bring me into spoiler territory.<br /><br />Idina Menzel is not as over the top as she is on stage, but there's still plenty of fire power there, and she's bigger than anything in the movies since the heyday of Betty Hutton!  She looks remarkably beautiful and she doesn't miss a trick; and just when you think she'll overshadow Tracie Thoms as her attorney girlfriend, Joanne, the latter pulls off some memorable comic business and signals her disappointment and regret with her expressive brown eyes.  Anthony Rapp is charming as Mark Cohen, he comes off as a tiny terror, I wonder how tall he is, the constant scenes of him snarking down the streets with his fists clenched in anger at his sides, but no one else around to reveal his true proportions--the old Alan Ladd trick.  And Adam Pascal is suave and tormented in equal measures as Roger.  His eyelashes are so long I expected them to have a special spotlights in the credits, but no.<br /><br />I have to disagree with the posters who claim that Larson wrote all the best numbers for the men in the cast.  Maybe that's personal pleading, but I find the best songs pretty much divided right down the middle.  Mimi's \\"Out Tonight\\" isn't as exciting as on stage, but it is much more compellingly staged, as Rosario Dawson steps out of the Cat Scratch Club after her shift only to launch into the second verse, and seems to scale the wall of the loft to get to Roger like Catwoman in the third.  (\\"I'll let you make me . . .\\")  \\"Light My Candle\\" suffers a little without Daphne Rubin-Vega in it, and Adam Pascal acts as though he knows he's cheating on her with Rosario Dawson.  Afterwards he gets his balls back.  The ensemble singing of \\"Will I?\\" and \\"Another Day\\" are perfectly staged and rehearsed, and it's there that I started to lose it.  I guess I must have spent the last seventy minutes of the movie in a continual rain of tears.  By the end I had to sit through all the credits in a vain attempt to gather composure.  The faces of those whom I lost to AIDS flashed before my eyes.  Not all of them, but some of them.  I did resolve to go out and try to practice love on a grand scale.  They got me this time.  \\"No other path, no other way, give in to love or live in fear.\\"<br /><br />These sentiments are vapid and, in the daylight, seem a little silly, but the beauty and power of the movie is to convince you of their truth.Good work all around.  I hope the movie's an enormous success.r truth.  Good work all around.  I hope the movie's an enormous success.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|It's about time that the King came back to reclaim his crown as the 8th Wonder of the World. I'm happy to report that this DVD release of \\"King Kong\\" is a breath of fresh air since the only other edition available was the cheesy remake with Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange and Charles Grodin. Why did it take so long? Because the nitrate negative is long gone and Warner had to painstakingly find the best film elements to bring Kong back from the brink of death.<br /><br />\\"King Kong\\" is a pivotal film in the fantasy genre. Calling something a pivotal film can sometimes lead to disappointment particularly for contemporary audiences jaded and spoiled by CGI effects. \\"Kong\\" established the benchmark for nearly 25 years. Animator Willis O'Brien (a former newspaper man) had worked on \\"The Lost World\\" for director Harry Hoyt. O'Brien began world on \\"Creation\\" a film about sailors who find a lost world not unlike in the silent film by Hoyt. The project was abandoned when O'Brien and his collaborators began work on Kong the 8th Wonder of the World. O'Brien developed stop-motion animation techniques and models (with model designer and builder Marcel Delgado) that would ultimately revolution visual effects. Director/writer Merian C. Cooper (\\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", \\"Dr. Cyclops\\") and producer/writer/director Ernest B. Schoedsack (\\"Son of Kong\\", \\"Mighty Joe Young\\") created a riveting fantasy film unlike anything ever seen before.<br />A beautiful looking transfer from Warner Home Video enhances this classic film which has been in very poor condition for a long, long time. The image clarity is exceptionally good as is the sharpness of the picture with rich, detailed vistas that haven't looked this good since 1933. Grain is noticeable but that's not a surprise given how far away from the original missing nitrate negative these elements are from. The DVD transfer minimizes grain as much as possible and analog artifacts in the form of dirt or flecks are minimal. The mono sound is also quite good benefiting from a substantial digital clean up that makes the dialogue clear and gives presence to Max Steiner's classic score.<br /><br />We learn quite a bit about \\"Kong\\" and other films in the two documentaries included in this set. \\"I'm King Kong\\" focuses on director Merian C. Cooper's many exploits. It's clear how Cooper's life influenced \\"Kong\\" once you see the documentary. The documentary runs about an hour. My only complaint is that there isn't a documentary devoted exclusively to Willis O'Brien as part of this set. There's also the wonderful recration of the cut spider sequence. It wasn't integrated into the movie because it's a recreation and it was felt that wouldn't be appropriate. It does give us a flavor of what the sequence might have looked like. Jackson and WETA recreate the sequence using the exact same techniques that O'Brien used and even get the grain and imperfect mattes, well, perfect.<br /><br />\\"RKO Production 601: The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World\\" runs about 2 hours and gives you a complete history of the production. Featuring interviews with Ray Harryhausen, Peter Jackson, writer-director Frank Darabont and others, it's an excellent glimpse into the atmosphere that produced the big ape. We also learn a bit about Willis O'Brien as well. \\"Son of Kong\\" comes only with the original theatrical trailer and doesn't have any of the frills of the other two movies.<br />King Kong\\" comes with an exceptional commentary track featuring Harryhausen, visual effects Ken Ralston and snippets of audio interviews of director Merian C. Cooper and actress Fay Wray. Harryhausen is really the expert on \\"Kong\\" though as he worked with O'Brien on \\"Might Joe Young\\"and had a chance to pick his brain. He uses his experience as a stop-motion animator and visual effects technician to provide interesting insights on the production of the film whether it be on the use of painted class backgrounds (to give depth to the miniatures) or the use of miniature projection of live action into the miniatures to create a sense of realism.<br /><br />Long Live the King! I'm still looking forward to Peter Jackson's remake and am hoping it can do justice to the original.action into the miniatures to create a sense of realism.    Long Live the King!

B000AGTPUA|4.0|Believing in the spirit of Christmas becomes a challenge for a young boy in the charming movie \\"The Polar Express\\" based on Chris Van Allburg's children's book. On Christmas Eve the boy is invited to ride a train to the North Pole by the conductor (Tom Hanks) and a chance to discover the his power to believe in  Christmas once and for all.<br /><br />Although audiences initially gave \\"Express\\" a chilly reception the film actually more than broke even at the box office due to repeat visits from fans of the film and a vaunted IMAX presentation. While there have been complaints that the motion capture technology used here (a familiar technique used less extensively in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, \\"I, Robot\\" and \\"King Kong\\") giving the characters a creepy look, I found the film to be perfectly charming and no less inviting than watching any other CGI movie. While it's clear that this technique is still in its infancy (or, perhaps, in the toddler phase at this point), director Zemeckis makes good use of the technique to render characters that are believable and amazing background for the film.  \\"The Polar Express\\" is guaranteed to be a perennial at Christmas time. Tom Hanks essays a number of roles in the film which is something that could have been done without CGI (think of Peter Sellers and all the characters he played in \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" or Mike Myers in the Austin Powers movies) but the use of CGI makes the transformation into other characters a bit more believable visually.<br /><br />\\"Express\\" looks quite good on DVD. We don't see any analog artifacts (not a surprise given that it was shot digitally and rendered in a computer) nor do we see edge enhancement or other digital artifacts I've come to expect from movies shot either on film. Again, this isn't a surprise given the fact that this was transferred directly from the digital files to DVD. The colors on the train are warm and inviting while those set outside in the chilly, snow filled night has just the right frosty edge to them. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track sounds marvelous with crisp, clear dialogue and nice use of the surround format. The rear speakers get considerable workout with ambience and the rattle filled ride on the train enveloping us in the world of the film.<br /><br />The release of single and double disc movies is becoming more of a trend. It's clear that studios recognize that there are those who watch only the movie and have begun tailoring their DVD releases more and more for different segments of the audience. The single disc edition has just the movie and a trailer (unless you purchased the single disc edition at Best Buy--it comes with a mini-DVD that features footage from \\"You Look Familiar\\" one of the extras on the two disc edition).<br /><br />On the two disc edition you get a whole lot of extras some of which are interesting but hardly essential. \\"You Look Familiar\\" focuses on the performances of Tom Hanks and others in their multiple roles and the use of performance capture to enhance their acting for the film. We see footage of the live performance capture work show with the scene from the film which is a nice before and after comparison.<br /><br />\\"Genuine Ticket to Ride\\" features five featurettes after an introduction. \\"Performance Capture\\", \\"Virtual Camera\\", \\"Hair and Wardrobe\\", \\"Creating the North Pole\\" and \\"Music\\". At under 12 minutes it can't possible offer the depth that filmmakers might want. Nevertheless you'll learn a thing or two about the production and the obstacles, challenges and triumphs that faced the film crew.<br /><br />\\"Josh Groban at the Greek\\" features the popular singer performing the song \\"Believe\\" as well as a featurette on the creation of the song. \\"Meet the Snow Angels\\" Share the memories of cast and crew about their favorite Christmas. \\"Polar Express Challenge\\" provides an interactive game. It's not bad but kids will only want to play once or twice and forget about it once the novelty wears off. There'salso a number of bonus clips throughout the second disc that are called \\"Stocking Stuffers\\" to be discovered for those who wisely use their remote control.<br /><br />Surprisingly Warner chose not to provide much detail or in depth background on the production of the film and its CGI rendering techniques. That's too bad. While this kid friendly approach will certainly be appreciated by the film's core audience, adults like to be entertained and informed as well. Perhaps we'll see something more adult orientated in the \\"Special Special Edition\\" that will no doubt come out just in time for the Holidays next year.<br /><br />\\"The Polar Express\\" charms with its delightful performances, groundbreaking use of CGI and \\"performance capture\\". While the extras could have been more comprehensive and more filling, they aren't bad. I'd suggest sticking to the single disc edition since the movie is the real highlight and the second disc probably won't be watched more than once (if that). Zemeckis has done a terrific job translating this children's story to the screen although it does have the feeling that it is padded a bit. I'd recommend the single disc edition vs. the two disc as I didn't feel the additional extras were all they were cracked up to be. Everybody jump on board but make sure to bring some hot chocolate and a nice warm blanket as it's going to be a long but fun filled ride.off.

B0009QZ456|5.0|I simply cannot understand any negative reviews for this album.  <br />Gavin DeGraw has a vocal range and tone of voice that no modern artist can reach. Yes, there are comparisions to John Mayer, Howie Day etc, but for me Gavin is head and shoulders above them. <br /> <br />I don't understand how anyone can be negative to his lyrics - if you listen to the whole album and put the lyrics in context, you will see what a talented songwriter he is. <br /> <br />Yes, Gavin has signed to a record label, but I think he is one of the only artists who still manages to do his own thing without being manufactured and sold in a certain way which is very rare these days. Remember he turned down record deals before eventually signing. To me he sings what he wants to and how he wants to and that is what music is all about to me.  <br /> <br />Anyone with a negative review has obviously never seen him live either. As he continues to grow in popularity (and yes, he falls prey to teen idols), he still plays amazing gigs despite the screaming girls wanting to touch him. Importantly he hasn't lost sight of his music and I hope he never will. It annoys me that just because he has picked up young screaming fans people automatically assume he has no credibitliy. <br /> <br />Just listen to the music - that is what it is all about. And also, check out his unreleased material - Dancing Shoes is by far the best unreleased song I have ever heard. <br /> <br />Negative reviews on this album are the only negative reviews I have ever heard about Gavin. I guess music is very personal, but for me, this hits the nail on the head. I love it. <br /> <br />
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|A great pop philosopher once said, \\"You may leave school but it never leaves you\\"*, nowhere is that more true than at the high school for the off-spring of superheroes Sky High literally located among the clouds. Although this superhero satire isn't quite as deft as  \\"The Incredibles\\" or even \\"Mystery Men\\" was at its best, it's an enjoyable romp that kids will laugh at and parents won't feel embarrassed to watch. Sure it may come across as a glorified Disney TV movie but what elevates the film above that are the performances of the cast. Will (Michael Angarano) is the son of the greatest superhero the world has ever known; The Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). When not fighting crime this married duo fight the war of real estate sales. When it appears that Will has no superpowers, he's worried that he'll disappoint his dad and end up just relegated to sidekick classes at his new high school Sky High. His worst fears seem a reality when in his first day at school Coach Boomer (the wonderful Bruce Campbell) drops a car on him and the best Will can do is avoid being crushed putting him in the \\"sidekick\\" category like his teacher The Commander's former sidekick Mr. Boy (Dave Foley). Now Will not only has to deal with peer pressure, the hazards of dating and razzing from the school bullies he also has to figure out a way to survive as nothing more than a glorified geek. Will discovers resources he didn't think he had when the school, his friends and his family are threatened by a seemingly unstoppable villain.<br /><br />As usual Buena Vista provides an exceptional crisp transfer. There weren't any analog defects that I could note and, truly, this transfer looks super most of the time. But like all superheroes this DVD does have its weakness-there's some minor edge enhancement noticeable in some scenes and some minor compression artifacts particularly in scenes that involved swirling mists and/or dust clouds. On the whole The Commander would be proud. The sound is equally super with remarkably crisp and clear dialogue. The surround speakers are nicely used putting you in the middle of the action.<br /><br />While it appears that this film might have some mild mannered extras, most of them are pretty good overall. \\"Breaking Down the Walls: The Stunts of `Sky High'\\" focuses on the stunt action of the film and, given that this is a fantasy film with flying superheroes and kids that shoot fire out of their hands, there's quite a few of those.  \\"Welcome to Sky High\\" is a behind-the-scenes featurette. It resembles the promotional featurette that the Disney Channel ran when the show was in theaters. It's not profound but then again neither is the movie and it does provide enough of a glimpse behind-the-scenes to satisfying most kids. We also get an alternate opening sequence along with the \\"I Melt with You\\" (a remake of the 80's hit single by the British band Modern English) music video featuring the band Bowling for Soup.<br /><br />An enjoyable film that probably would have been a Disney Channel original movie if not for the star power and visual effects involved, \\"Sky High\\" won't insult kids nor will they be demanding a sequel. Parents will enjoy some of the silly hijinks that happens in the film as well. It's worth a rental and might keep your kids occupied while you're busy wrapping those Christmas gifts.<br /><br />*Songwriter Andy Partridge \\"Playground\\" from XTC's album \\"Wasp Star\\"oud.

0262731541|1.0|Unfortunately, my copy of edition 3 fell open to page 81, in which the author compares forces from a piston engine to forces generated by living tissue. Unfortunately, this type of comparison is often completely invalid, particularly when the force is accompanied by zero motion in the direction of the force. For example, if the combustion force is replaced by a highly compressed spring, and if the crank is balanced exactly at top dead center, the spring will never \\"get tired\\" of exerting its force. In contrast, a human leg WILL get tired, even though no motion occurs. This is because chemical energy is consumed to exert the force even in the absence of motion.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, with this single unreasoned comparison that drives to the core of bicycling science, the author has shot himself in the credibility foot, leaving all else he has to say in question.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Watched Titanic again.  Not only is this a masterpiece filled with visual storytelling and state of the art special effects but the story is of such consequence at the turn of this century, that it became an instant classic. What a compelling tale of the largest ship ever  to sink to the depths of the cold North Atlantic Ocean taking hundreds of precious lives in the process, mainly because of the senselessness of intelligent men risking everything to prove their prowess and their superiority. For what?    Everything that went into this film makes it truly a classic.  A simple rich-pauper young love story that grabbed hearts. The marvel of being on this great vessel and sailing with it again. The opulence, the characters, the color, the fun of it all.  Yes, we all experience the thrill and the excitement of the moments. Watching the events that lead up to that eventful brush with the iceberg. The spectacle, the horror and the loss of seeing it all die. We are left heart broken and we love it.  Then there was the song, so tenderly sung by French Canadian songbird Celine Dion. You bet we fell for it.    The single vision of writer/director James Cameron was determined to craft this epic, no matter what the cost. Reputedly $250 million US dollars. I remember a week before the film was to open, all the critics, media moguls and so many people in the entertainment industry knew, yes knew, that this was going to be the greatest flop in film history. So much so that the horrors of \\"Heavens Gate\\", the film that sunk the studio (United Artists), were revived. Titanic was a story everyone knew, everyone died, disaster films had had their fling and were no longer successful, and James Cameron was massively over budget to the point of the studios demanding back his salary. This film was a looser from the start. But the public prove them all wrong.    Thank you James Cameron for bringing this story to life like no other could. Yes, we truly lived the experience and are so much richer for it.    And yes, this is the DVD edition everyone has been waiting for, especially me.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I have been a system fan since they first came to be.  Anyone who says 'i wish more this was like the first album', or 'this doesn't sound like system used to be'....WHO CARES!! IT SHOULDN'T BE!! This is album number 5, or number 4-part 2, not number one! its almost 8 years later!! Bands evolve, the people in the bands evolve and grow older, system has evolved incredibly!!  Yes this is drasticly different than their first two albums. Then Steal This Album was a major turning point towards some more off the wall stuff, mezmerize was VERY different, and this album is just off the chain! If I was to hear this album immediately after their first album, I would be shocked, probably in a bad way.  I love the old style they had, and even to my own surprise love this style as well.  <br /> <br /> To be honest, i didn't know how much i would like this album when i made my first listen through it, but then i realized that even the songs i thought i didn't like, like Vicinity of Obscenity, and She's Like Heroin, were absolutely stuck in my head. (how can banana banana banana terra cotta pie over and over not get stuck???) Listen to the CD two or three times on random and repeat, and try to tell me that when that next song comes on that your not like \\"sweet this song again, this one is awesome!!\\" , and you probably will be able to sing a bit of it.  <br /> <br />I agree, I am not particularly a fan of Daron's singing in the least bit, Serj absolutely dominates, his chanting is hauntingly powerful, however, rather than just focusing on Daron's lack of singing skills, just focus on how the songs work, these guys really put their all into their music, and i think you can really feel that. I think Daron does a good job on Lonely Day, Serj is definitely necessary for the chorus, and I think the tone and pace of the song is a welcome change. <br /> <br /> If your a true fan of any band you will accept the fact that a band will evolve, and if they are a good band its a very good thing.  System is so so so far from being stale and stagnant, its great. The range of tempos within each individual song keeps me absolutely hooked, and waiting to see what happens next. Songs like Holy Mountains, Stealing Society, Soldier Side, damn THE WHOLE ALBUM is just amazing.  In my opinion this is their most harmonious album yet, and to me, the most enojyable to listen to and sing with, its the SH*T!!.  Gotta mix it up now and then with some Deer Dance, Mind, Forest, Marmalade, Highway Song, Aerials, Ego Brain, Sad Statue, Spiders, Shimmy, Chic-n-Stu, Nuguns, and more. The diversity is amazing.  Long Live System!
6305388458|2.0|I love Life of Brian.  It is one of the wittiest movies I know.  But the sound quality on the DVD (the $9.99 version, not the Criterion version) is appalling.  The disk doesn't offer subtitles so one misses half the dialogue, listening to the muffled, garbled sound track.  I've never heard a worse DVD.  Don't buy this version!
B000AA4LAK|5.0|An excellent album, to say the least. The album is a very moody and contemplative, very new age 80's revival sort of thing. No one track stands out very much more than any other, but best songs are more towards the beginning, ending with the melancholy/hope laden \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\". The three extra tracks are alright, worth the extra dollar or so, but one should definitely focus on the main album.  <br /> <br />Be sure to check these songs out: <br /> <br />\\"Mr. Brightside\\" one of the more radio friendly songs, pretty weird. Very 80's.  <br />\\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" is probably the best song on the album, with it's strong synth melody and haunting lyrics.  <br />\\"Change your Mind\\" another synth heavy song, but cheerfull and up-tempo. A generally pleasing song all around. <br /> <br />Overall, the whole band is comparable to Blur (I think, but that's coming from a Gorillaz fan). <br /> <br />An album that is most definitely worth your $15 dollars. You won't regret it.
B000BUW4VC|3.0|This has NOTHING to do with the orignal, it is only the same in name alone.<br /><br /> Keith had no part in this album, basically he had his voice recorded, then some random DJ's mixed that to some beats and called it Dr. Octagon II for sales purposes of course.<br /><br />All in all it ain't too bad, it just ain't legit, so save your cash and boot leg this one.
B0009MA8V0|4.0|American Idiot is certainly one of the best albums of the year. Definitely worth your $15 or so dollars. I don't really know how to describe it other than that all the songs are equally strong on the CD, no one track really standing out for me more than any other. It just doesn't seem like filler. What can I say? A great CD all around.
B000001FA4|4.0|U2, even at the beginning, were always restless as artists. Having already hit an artistic peak with the preceding \\"War,\\" the band chose to look outside their relationship with Steve Lillywhite to expand their horizons. They chose Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. Much like he did for Talking Heads, Eno brought the band to a new realization of what their sound on record could be, and the result was an album that propelled them into rock-star super-status.<br /><br />The mood on \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" altered significantly from \\"War,\\" as the moody \\"A Sort Of Homecoming\\" found U2 switching to a subtle approach that had only been hinted at on their prior three discs. The texture to songs like \\"Wire\\" and \\"Bad\\" were obviously inspired by Eno, and these songs have since entered into U2's list of classics.<br /><br />That is not to say that Eno's influence on \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" was a complete match. Both \\"MLK\\" and \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" found the still young band giving into a case of over-reaching. These kind of growing pains are what make \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" one of U2's non-five-star CD's, and also leaves it as the transitional album between a pair of masterpieces, \\"War\\" and \\"Joshua Tree.\\" It gave U2 a chance to expel a burst of artiness and fans a glimpse of where the introspective \\"Joshua Tree\\" would take root. But still, any CD that contains songs as amazing as \\"Bad\\" or the radio-hit breakthrough of \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\\" has got to be recognized as a terrific effort.<br /><br />(Also, why has this album and the U2 catalog not been upgraded? U2 are easily one of the best and most influential bands on the planet, and their early albums deserve more than to have shoddy liner notes and a late 80's quality CD transfer.)
B000005IU1|5.0|Those who know..KNOW!!!! THE STOOGE's were one of the first band's to FRIGHTEN AMERICAN's with a brand of sour ROT N ROLL..these guy's are the father's to a million bas*tard band's..so many try but will never equal 'em!! <br /> <br />Much credit goes out to Ron and his brother..they never will get thier credit like ''Iggy'' did..BUT HEY I GIVE THEM IT!!!!! YOU GUY's RULE!!!!!! PEOPLE STILL REALIZE YOU WERE THE BRAINCHILD BEHIND THE BAND!!!! RON YOU ARE A GREAT INFLUENCE TO MANY OF US!! <br /> <br />CLASICK STUFF!!!! IF ONLY THIS COULD BE ON MTV TODAY WE WOULD HAVE THINKING YOUTH..BUT NOPE..WE ARE LEFT WITH THE LIVING DEAD ''emo'' KUNTZZ!! <br /> <br />BUY TODAY!!!!
B000002GB9|5.0|This album is pretty close to perfect. Eight tracks of real rock. I wouldn't skip a single track if I were to pop this in. But, it is a little too short. Burn this with \\"Pieces of Eight\\" or \\"Crystal Ball\\" and you get an AWESOME disk.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Im going to get right to the point and say it was a good movie but the green goblin looked like a power rangers villian spider-mans eyes sucked (...)they should have gave him mcfarlanes eyes buy and try it
B0000062GE|5.0|In the wake of Nine Inch Nails in the 90's, SW is arguably the best band that used a similiar approach to the angry, sad mood in music. Darkest Days, which was their best release, is very catchy but it also gets to you on an emotional level, especially if you're going through something difficult, or if you're just unsatisfied with the way your life is going (*raises hand*). My favorite song on this album by far is 'Waking up Beside You', it's got a great riff and the vocals are good as well. Most people know the single from this album 'Save Yourself', which is good but certainly not among the best. 2nd favorite track on the album is probably 'Haunting Me' or 'Goodbye'. <br /> <br />I havn't listened to their newer self-titled release but from what I hear they turned into some type of happy-go-lucky frat-boy band, and then broke up. What a shame. if you enjoy this I reccomend NIN (obviously), and Tool. <br /> <br />
0553801503|1.0|To preface this, the first three books in this series are magnificent. High fantasy (whatever that means), at its best.  I think Martin is a fantastic writer and the Song of Ice and Fire series superb. His fantasy crushes Tolkien's boring, gay, and pretentious blather, and whether that's a thorned complement, I'll let you decide.<br /><br />A Feast for Crows, the fourth volume in the set, was never originally intended to exist.<br /><br />And it shows.<br /><br />Reading Storm of Swords a second time around, it's very clear Martin set all the characters and the action in a place where they would hibernate for five years and then pick up when the narrative began in the future, presumably during a terrible winter.<br /><br />What we missed we'd be told through backstory and flashback, a much more effective means of conveying what the reader needs to know than releasing hundreds and hundreds of pages of boring filler.<br /><br />And that is Feast... more like a dull and slightly painful school lunch you know is going to give you the runs later in the day.<br /><br />I was not surprised there were no surprises or real plot twists in this book. How could there be, when the narrative was meant to skip 5 years? Everything that happened was predictable and no one really went from point A to point B. Rather, they chilled at point A for so long it was almost painful to read.<br /><br />The Brienne chapters were pointless. She might have made an interesting point of view, but no. She's looking for Sansa Stark... going through lands in Westeros that aren't even on the map and most of which were never even mentioned before. The worst part is the whole redundancy of it. We as the reader know where Sansa is. There is absolutely no point to this quest in a successful, interesting story. Definitely, the Brienne chapters were like suffering through commercials... but they bore so little on the smidgen of story within the whole book, the reader could easily skip them without missing anything whatsoever.<br /><br />The Cersei and Jaime chapters seemed to roll and slam into each other like a group of unruly puppies in a kid's swimming pool. We get information driven into our head two, sometimes three times through their points of view as if we're reading a Left Behind book. Repetitive, redundant, and again, pointless, all of their overlapping stuff could have been cut without any loss.<br /><br />The worst thing is Martin seems to be repeating himself. The same descriptions (nipples on a breastplate, nipples on a woman) appear over and over again. Then in Jaime's chapters he repeats probably 20 times a sentence Tyrion told him about Cersei, splicing this into his narrative.<br /><br />I wonder if Martin subcontracted this out to a ghostwriter... it's really that bad, and that much of a departure from the other three in writing skill.<br /><br />There is some great stuff with the headsman Illyn Payne and Jaime sparring, and an interesting development with the religion of the Seven, but all in all, this book would have been much better for the series if pieces of it were included through flashbacks or backstory.<br /><br />EDIT as of 7-27-11. It's been more than five years but finally the second installment is out. And it's even worse than Feast. I'm downgrading my rating to 1 star as both books together is a heap of rubbish.emed to roll and slam into each other like a group of unruly puppies in a kid's swimming pool.

B000AADYRQ|5.0|Well this isn't as good as Transatlanctism(I'll call it T. for now on). And I'll be honest about that. T. was just a great CD that mixed its song together perfectly and even with its sad lyrics, it was warm. <br /> <br />Plans seems much more sad and sometimes even cold. These elements at first pained me to hear when I flipped in Plans in my player. For a while I thought Death Cab had seriously screwed up, but the more I listened, the more the album growed on me.  <br /> <br />When I first got it, I'd give it a 4. That obviously has changed. My favorite tracks are Marching Bands of Manhattan, Different Names for the Same Thing, Soul Meets Body, Crooked Teeth, Stable Song, and I Will Follow You Into The Dark. Crooked Teeth reminds me of Soul Meets Body. It's one of those few fun songs that makes you bop along on a Death Cab album.  <br /> <br />I Will Follow You Into The Dark is a pretty acoustic song that is just nice to listen. Marching Bands of Manhattan is a great opener and the lyrics at the end are really spectacular. <br /> <br />The CD may have taken me a while to really enjoy, but in the end it does and is worth every penny.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|A lot of people seem to criticize the increased role Darren has taken, and, while I do agree that Serj is the better lyricist, I think they both sound great, and the tag-teaming they are doing adds a little more to the effect. It does not detract from the sound, as some might suggest. That said, I haven't given this enough listens yet to decide if I like it more than Mezmerize...Mezmerize was great and the pair of Hollywood songs at the end made that whole album worthwhile.  <br />Attack is a great album starter...it starts off heavy, goes into a different section that breaks into a typical SOAD crescendo that leads into the heaviness again...great political message, as always <br />Kill Rock N Roll has a nice upbeat drum section to start, and this is the song where I think the tag team singing is at its best...another great concept, in line with Old School Hollywood from Mezmerize <br />Hypnotize is also great with a great drum breakdown in the middle of it...this song is arranged perfectly, and works to expand SOAD's repetoire, if nothing else <br />Tentative is one of my favorite tracks. It sticks with the SOAD formula, with anti-war sentiment throughout...the heavy sections of this song are great, and the breakdown into the slower, more melodic sections are equally great...there's a great background vocal melody at about the 2 minute mark, that gives this an apocolyptic feel <br />Vicinity of Obscenity starts with some nice fast-paced rim shots, and remains solid throughout, one of the funnest songs on the album...reminds me of a more down-played version of violent pornography <br />Soldier Side seems to sum up the anti-war sentiment that the group has...it's a great song lyrically, and it showcases the vocal abilities of the singers perfectly...the breakdown at 2:10 is worth waiting for, and this just serves as a great close to a great year of SOAD music (\\"surprisingly enough\\" ends with the same guitar riff that begins Mezmerize) <br />Overall, this album may not win any new fans for SOAD (I'd suggest starting with Toxicity for new fans), but it's a great SOAD album that a fan couldn't do without  <br />(I'd give it a 5, but I reserve that for very few albums)
B000002H97|5.0|This is probably the least of Metallica's five great albums, but it sure packs in an exceptional punch. \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Sad but true\\", \\"holier than thou\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\" are standouts. <br /> <br />Other recommendations: <br />Metallica : Master of puppets <br />Metallica : And justice for all <br />Metallica : Ride the lightning <br />Metallica : Kill em all <br />Megadeth : Rust in peace <br />Megadeth : Countdown to extinction
B000002HAJ|4.0|I initially didn't care much for \\"Wish\\", but now I call it their best from the 90's. After the consistency of \\"Disintegration\\", this album was released and reminds me more of the \\"Head On The Door/Kiss Me\\" albums in its diversity. It's also rather lengthy at 66 minutes. \\"Wish\\" has the epics, the moody pieces, and the hits, all in one disc. I truly love each song, but the better ones are \\"High\\", \\"Apart\\", \\"A Letter To Elise\\", and \\"End\\". \\"Friday I'm In Love\\" might be their biggest hit ever, but like many Cure fanatics, I've heard it once too often. This is a good starting point for new fans, after one of the collections I guess. Overall, I'd call \\"Wish\\", \\"Bloodflowers\\", and the live album \\"Paris\\" the best of their last 15 years.

B000008JUM|4.0|Long before the \\"De-Lovely\\" soundtrack, this collection was the place for Cole Porter covers. This AIDS benefit is typical for something like this, meaning many different bands and styles, but it succeeds more often than not. First of all, at 20 tracks, even if only half were good, you'd still have ten great covers. My picks for the best are from Neneh Cherry, Sinead O'Connor, Neville Brothers, Les Negresses Vertes, and Jimmy Somerville. I also really like the Debbie Harry and Iggy pop duet, and my reason for purchase was for the cover of \\"Night And Day\\". U2 do such an amazing job on that song, and it's one of my favorites of theirs and Cole Porters. In truth, almost every cover here I enjoy at least a little, and some are quite interesting. Overall I say that twenty Cole Porter songs sung by twenty artists is a red hot deal.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is one of the best albums to come out in recent years. My Chemical Romance has made originality and solid, interesting song writing cool again. For years we have been feed boy band, lip sync, pop trash by manufactured acts with no musical talent beyond looking pretty. My Chemical Romance has restored my faith in American music and in the existence of REAL bands, who are about entertaining, integrity, and performance. This album does not fit into any pre-fashioned mold. Even within the worlds of emo/screamo/handcore/punk/rock or any other stupid label people want to place on music, My Chemical Romance stands out, and at the very least they should be respected for that alone.     Oh, and by the way, there is no whining about how bad their lives suck on this album. The only songs that even come close to addressing their life experiences directly within the lyrics are; I'm Not Okay (I Promise) and Helena, and that's just raw and honest song writing. This album is a quasi-concept piece about love, death, loss, and revenge. It's an album with *gasp* a PLOT. The vocals are raw and *gasp* emotional, the way it should be. Music without emotion is worthless. So by definition, ALL good music; past and present is EMO. Buy this album if you like good song writing and good music and have the guts to be original and not jump on the elitist, emo hating, if a band is successful and gets played on MTV they must suck, bandwagon. Judge THE MUSIC for yourself. Good or bad, make up your own mind.
0553801503|3.0|Just finished the book, and while Martin is not a bad writer by any means, this simply lacks the narrative drive of the other books in the series. <br /> <br />Violence is certainly toned down in this tome, and the biggest battles happen off-screen, but that's not the problem as political machinations have always been a big lure to Martin's books. We're given chapter after chapter of brooding characters who are essentially acting the same way in the same situations from chapter to chapter. It seemed I was halfway through the book before any of the characters had goals and started to move. Thank God for Brienne, the only character who consistantly had new situations to adapt and overcome (or not). For the most part, though, Martin chooses to focus on trivial character and atmospheric details that do little to give the book any purpose. <br /> <br />The redeeming quality is that the book wraps up as a classic Martin novel. We see a resurgence of the Byzantine maneuvering, and the series is well-positioned for an epic conclusion - after the next book comes out, anyway.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Captain Dobey is played here by an actor other than Bernie Hamilton (who played him in the regular eps). The pilot features many shots that became part of the show's opening credits (like Huggie Bear entering). Has humor too as S+H are waiting outside a hotel in the bushes while it's raining and a dog approaches.
B0006L16N8|1.0|How can you call this piece of trash the best album of 2005? For the best album of 2005 by 'Angel of Retribution' buy Judas Priest, or 'Ghost Reveries' by Opeth, if its must be mainstream get 'Demon Days' by Gorillaz, or even 'Mezmerize' by System of a Down. Coldplay is possibly the most overrated band since the turn of the century. Chris Martin is the worst vocalist since Fred Durst. Honestly I just can't stand this goddamn annoying voice! He's worse than Chester Bennington, Nick Carter, 50 Cent and Amy Lee combined and multiplied. Their poor excuse of a guitarist plays only few riffs and can't solo, the piano is slow and boring and the lyrics are unoriginal.  The worst thing is by far the whiny vocals. But the music itself is bland and extremely boring. All their songs sound the same. I never liked Coldplay. When 'Rush of Blood' got out a friend lent me a copy and I listened to the whole album to find if I can dig at least one song and nope. I got so bored that I fell asleep hahahahaha!!!   I still don't see why people are that crazy abot it. Is it because they're british? I agree that the British has probably the best hold on modern music. Or its that because they feel badass for ripping off Pink Floyd and Radiohead. Or that people just pretend to like them but nobody really does.    'Parachutes', 'Rush of Blood' and 'X&Y' are 3 of the worst albums in music history. And if this is considered to be some of the best so the future of music seems dark. Really dark.    Maybe my review gets 3 of 100 helpful votes but at least I wrote an intelligent review and not just (...).
6300182193|4.0|Like when Lucy in the last scene starts blinking her eyes a lot. I chuckled at that one. Also, when Jonathon Harker scares Lucy in the middle of the night for a joke it's rather humorous as well.And you hear the old goofy line by Drac \\"I never drink---wine\\".
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I always seem to stumble across new Enya albums on accident.  Like \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" which I found accidentally while looking for something by Enigma.  And \\"Amarantine,\\" which I discovered here on accident a while back while browsing New Age albums.  \\"Untitled\\" by Enya came up and of course I fixated on that immediately, and our local Wal-Mart actually picked it up (they never did pick up Vertical Horizon's rerelease of \\"Go,\\" a fact which peeves me no end), and I snatched it up just yesterday.  I mean, it's been FIVE YEARS now.  Even Enigma's put something else out in the meantime.  (\\"Voyageur\\"--go on and check it out, I recommend it.) <br /> <br />In any case, \\"Amarantine\\" is no \\"Watermark,\\" but it's slightly better than \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" which rather disappointed me.  (I USED to like \\"Only Time,\\" until they made it into a dance version, and played the original one ad nauseam in EVERY NBC ad there was...*gags*)  \\"Amarantine\\" is kind of a letdown too but it's tolerable.  (Though I do wish she would pronounce things \\"-TEEN\\" and not \\"-TYNE.\\"  Ugh!  And what exactly is \\"amarantine\\"?  Did she mean \\"amaranthine\\"--\\"eternally beautiful, unfading, everlasting\\"...?)  Most of the songs haven't stuck with me since listening to the CD twice last night, I admit.  And the title track wasn't one of the two that did.  Well, it STUCK with me, but not in a good way.  As I type the title I keep hearing \\"Amarantine, amarantine, amamamama...\\"  I know, that's not what she's singing, but that's what I keep hearing. <br /> <br />The first track, \\"Less Than A Pearl,\\" is gorgeous, moody, and borderline ominous, like walking through a forest at dusk.  I love this song and it's only too bad that most of the others didn't follow its example; I think it's the slightly menacing tone of the song that sets it apart, actually, whereas most of the tracks on this CD are wishy-washy...eh.  Remember \\"Cursum Perficio\\"?  It's not that, but it's somewhat close.  I just wish there was an English-language version, as the English lyrics are so good, and mirror exactly how I've been feeling in life for a while now. <br /> <br />The other standout song is \\"The River Sings,\\" which, even though it's got an Irish-sounding tune, makes me think of voyageurs paddling their canoes, although most cheery songs with \\"river\\" in them tend to make me think of voyageurs paddling their canoes.  It's the one really upbeat song on the CD and truly surprised me when I heard it, compared to all the rest. <br /> <br />\\"Somebody Said Goodbye\\" didn't stick with me tunewise, but the lyrics also captured my attention, due to personal issues.  The rest has rather fled my mind, except for \\"Sumiregusa,\\" which just made me want to scream, \\"SING FASTER!!\\"  That song is one of the shortest, lyricswise, but one of the LONGEST when sung!  (I only just noticed how Enya loves to draw...lyrics...out...forever...)  I loved Enya's instrumentals on \\"Watermark,\\" but \\"Drifting\\" here is just that...drifting!!  That song actually caught me offguard because I was following the liner notes and of course, since it has no lyrics, it wasn't listed there.  It just rather meanders. <br /> <br />The lyrics to the rest of the songs were so beautiful that I do rather wish the tunes would have matched.  They aren't bad tunes, they're just...as I said, wishy-washy.  I hate to keep comparing \\"new\\" Enya to \\"old\\" Enya (as if there is a new and old Enya?), but most of the songs on \\"Watermark\\" had PUNCH to them.  \\"Amarantine\\" isn't bad, but I do wish it had a bit more PUNCH. <br /> <br />Then again, any Enya is better than no Enya!  So I'll keep listening to \\"Pearl\\" and \\"River\\" for now. <br />
0307263118|5.0|Once in a while a novelist totally captures the reader with his exquisite, finely wrought language. John Banville in THE SEA, the recent winner of the Booker Prize, is just such a writer. If you are not careful, you will be so taken by the beauty of his words, that you may miss the nuances of meaning so important to fitting all the parts of his story together.<br /><br />The narrator is Max Morden, an Irishman who a year after the death of his wife, returns to a town by the sea where he spent his summers over 50 years ago and fell under the spell of the Grace family, composed of the mother, father and twins: Chloe and Myles, a strange young lad who has never spoken. In a style reminiscent of Proust, Thomas Mann, Henry James and the best of Edmund White, Banville's narrator goes from the summers in the past to the recent \\"plague year\\" of his wife's terminal illness to the present where he rents a room in the Cedars, where once the Graces lived, and is now inhabited by the mysterious Miss Vavasour, the current landlady, and her only other tenant, the Colonel.<br /><br />You can open the book to almost any page and read beautiful, poetic language. On our memories of our youth: \\"So much of life was stillness then, when we were young, or so it seems now; a biding stillness; a vigilance. We were waiting in our as yet unfashioned world, scanning the future as the boy and I had scanned each other, like soldiers in the field, watching for what was to come.\\" Or on Banville's description of the sea: \\"Down here, by the sea, there is a special quality to the silence at night. I do not know if this is my doing, I mean if this quality is something I bring to the silence of my room, and even of the whole house, or if it is a local effect, due to the salt in the air, perhaps, or the seaside climate in general.\\"<br /><br />I would have been content if this novel had just been about Morden's musings on first love, the inexactitude of memory, the taking care of and losing in death of a wife far too early, the mild sorrow of what he might have done differently-- he opines that if Bonnard, the artist whom he is attempting to write about, didn't have all the answers then neither should he: \\"Why should I demand more veracity of vision of myself than of a great and tragic artist? We did our best, Anna [his wife] and I. We forgave each other for all that we were not.\\" Many a decent writer would have let it go at that. Banville does not. In the last few pages of this small novel, he delivers at least three body blows that the reader-- at least this one-- was not prepared for. Looking back, I see that the writer does drop clues along the away about the possible ending. Read carefully or Mr. Banville will take your breath away.h of a wife far too early, the mild sorrow of what he might have done differently-- he opines that if Bonnard, the artist whom he is attempting to write about, didn't have all the answers then neither should he: \\"Why should I demand more veracity of vision of myself than of a great and tragic artist?

B000BM6AVA|2.0|serj and daron imitate the vocals of the band Ruins to the point that its sickening. people constantly talk about how original serj's vocals are...and here he is ripping Ruins off, simply because he knows that very few people listen to them! same thing happened with the smashing pumpkins, when they totally ripped the intro from What's Going On from Husker Du, and then they used it on the song 1979. do me a favor and listen to the song Iron Lady from Ruins, from the record Stonehenge, and tell me that serj hasn't listened to that record. by the way, Ruins came first.
B00006I53S|5.0|Hi, <br /> <br />We've been using this lens for a while now and we're absolutely pleased with its performance. When we decided to get into the extremelly competitive field of wedding/special event photography business we knew we needed a lens that offered us the quality and flexibility to just forget about it and take great pictures. Thus far it has not disappointed us one bit! Great shots at both the wide end and the tele-foto end. Of course, if you are a photophile or professional you might find some nuisances with this great lens. However, for the real-world photography, enthusiasts, amateurs and semi-pro this lens offers a great value. I've recommended this lens to friends and colleagues and will keep doing so until I can find a better price-value choice. A definite must have for everyone with real-world needs (i.e. not uber professionals).
B000BM6AVA|4.0|This is just to repeat what you will read elsewhere. This is a good CD, but not as good as the earlier ones. A large reason for that is the singing of Daren... Sorry, he may be a nice guy, but he shouldn't be singing. Serj is a great vocalists, and I wouldn't mind it if Daren occationally joined in, but there's way too much of Daren's vocals here. Way too much.
0307276902|5.0|I loved this book. I definitely loved his writing style, I loved the fact it kept me interested, I loved the way he talked about his reality of hitting the bottom in addiction.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's a very inspirational book. James makes the reader feel his misery. \\"A million little pieces\\" shows you how James's life got easily off track; it shows you the horrors of withdrawal he went through but it also shows you that even though he lived a very messed up life, he got to stay clean<br /><br />As a reader, I was really touched by A million little pieces. At times, I'd cheer along James or I would feel overwhelmed. I have to say I was totally shocked to find out what happened to James's friends from the rehab center. It absolutely left me wanting to know more.<br /><br />In fact, I can't wait to read My Friend Leonard.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who suffers from an addiction, someone whose relative has problems with addiction or just about anyone who knows how to enjoy a very good read ^_^.<br /><br />vgxoxo@hotmail.com

Good reading, social commentary, and highly imaginative, keeping you intereted through to the end.

B0002ZDVEU|2.0|THE BOURNE IDENTITY was a fast-paced, beautifully-executed action movie filled with plenty of surprises. Unfortunately, this surprisingly unfocused sequel joins the ranks of INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM and BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II as examples of the law of diminishing returns. In THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, amnesiac/CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is once again forced out into the open when he's framed for murder. It's hardly the most original premise for a sophomore effort in a cinematic franchise, but surely it could have been told in a more coherent and better-paced fashion that what's being served up here. <br />     <br />In attempting to justify the continuance of a story that was wrapped up neatly in the first film, Bourne becomes a darker personality and, as a result, a far less likable character. Do we really care if he clears himself of a phony murder rap when we learn he's actually guilty of other crimes? This fatal misstep is compounded by aimless dialogue sequences bereft of genuine suspense and action scenes that are tossed in willy-nilly because that's what the filmmakers think the audience wants. A note to the filmmakers: What the audience wants is a thriller that doesn't try our patience or insult our sensibilities by thinking we'll accept a truckload of espionage clichs in lieu of a well-conceived screenplay.  <br />     <br />A great deal of THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is Supremely Dull, despite the chases, explosions, and gunplay. As this appears to be the second installment in a trilogy, they've got another chance to set things right. Even an assassin deserves better treatment than this. <br />
B000646MNE|5.0|I bought this set for my wife as our 7th anniversary gift.  She absolutly loved it! It also caused quite a sensation among her friends.<br /><br />I myself am a big fan of this series and really enjoy how it presents four points of views from women's perspectives (although I think most of the writers are men, they relied on real women to create interesting arguments) that couples can identify with, argue about or simply enjoy.  Some of the racier episodes will either make you laugh or  will put you in the mood to do  more interesting things than just watching TV.
B00000163G|5.0|This is easily Pac's best album. From \\"Ambitionz az a Ridah\\" to \\"California Love\\", Pac is bangin'. The highlight songs are \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\\", I ain't mad Acha\\" and \\"Can't C Me\\". <br /> <br />All Eyez on me was produced by Suge Knight, one of the best hip hop producers ever. Personally, I think he killed Pac but thats a different story. There were guest producers such as Daz and Dr. Dre. <br /> <br />2pac was straight outta jail on bail by Suge and Death Row Records.  That definatly affects his music and you can tell. He is acting like a star instead of a hungry kid. Like in \\"Can't C Me\\". Of course, there are positive songs like \\"Life Goes On\\" and \\"Shorty Wanna Be a Thug\\" <br /> <br />I reccomend this to everyone. Go and buy it!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It irks me when people review an album without allowing it time to breathe. I admit, I was at first taken back by madonna's new cd, not fully sure if it was good. But after a few spins, I've grown to become intoxicated by it. The first three songs blend together so well. \\"Get Together\\" is a grand old school Madonna anthem. \\"Sorry\\" is perfect ear candy. \\"Let it Be\\" is an awesome tune that turns itself inside out about 30 seconds into it. \\"Jump\\" is a balls to the floor club anthem. Do give this album a chance if you have enjoyed Madonna's earlier work in the least.
B000005Z0G|5.0|Strictly 4 my N.i.g.g.a.z. is Pac's most focused. This was before he got shot 5 times in a NY lobby and then blamed Biggie He mixes the politicalness from \\"2pacalypse Now\\", and a little bit of the thug persona from \\"All Eyez on Me\\".  There is the classic \\"Keep ya Head up\\" and the ballad about hoes, \\"I get around\\". Its not 2pac's best, but worth 5 stars.
B000AMWIVM|1.0|this film is doesn't make sense, so it starts where two guys are locked up, it's doesn't build up at all, there already there at the beginning. I like certain things to build up, not cut to chase that soon, but I don't like certain things to build up too long, it's got to be just right. terrible ending, worse than \\"War of the Worlds\\"   Ed Wood probably made better thrillers than this bloodbath crap. how does movie even in a genre, it's not horror nor suspense, it's bloodbath crap. Cary Elwes what happened to great lines like \\"hey great gift dad\\"
B000005Z0E|4.0|This is by far 2pac's most political album. With \\"trapped\\", \\"I don't give a f***\\" and \\"Words of Wisdom\\", it is. There is the classic, Brendas got a baby, and the F- the police songs like \\"violent\\" and \\"trapped\\". Its not 2pac's best. If you want his best, buy the Greatest Hits Cd or \\"All Eyez on Me\\". But if you are an old school hip hop fan, or just like people rebelling against society, than \\"2pacalypse Now\\" is for you.
0307276902|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a friend.  It has been a long time since I have found a book this good that I was unable to put down.  Within a few pages I was connected with the author.  His writing style is like no other, and really adds to the intensity of his story.  I saw him interviewed after I had read the book, and he said he chose that style of writing to make the reader feel addicted; like he was addicted to alcohol and drug abuse.  It worked!  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book!  Brilliant work James Frey!
0553801503|5.0|[Slight spoiler warnings, and I'll assume you've read the first three books] <br /> <br />Ok, so it wasn't as good as the first three books, but that was because everyone's favorite characters, Dany and Tyrion, didn't make an appearance. But what was there was top notch. George R. R. Martin still knows how to write: his prose is crisp, his characters compelling, his plot twisting and unpredictable. <br /> <br />As you probably know, production and time issue kept Martin from including the full cast of characters. The book, such as it was, was about 700 or so pages without the appendices and preview for the next book. It was a bit annoying, but I'll live with it. He added Cersei as a point of view character, and I was quite pleased; we had seen her from Ned and Jaime's point of views, and it was nice to get inside her head.  <br /> <br />One critique might be that there were two subplots going on, one with the Iron Men and one on the Dorne. I say these are side plots only because they were told entirely through point of view characters that hadn't been so in the previous books. They weren't bad in and of themselves, and they do have significant connections to the overall plot, but it was annoying at first to have to withstand a flurry of new point of view characters. But stick with them, they get good. <br /> <br />Trust me, if you were engrossed by the first three books, you will continue to be. My friend complained he thought Arya got shortchanged in terms of number of chapters, but I think the balance was reasonable. Jaime and Cersei probably got the most face time, which isn't a bad thing: I love how, as the first book was mostly about the Starks, the series has devoted more and more time as it progressed to seeing things from the Lannister perspective. Jaime himself was my favorite in the book, as he continues to struggle with the loss of his hand and his father (his hand and the realm's). You'll notice the interplay between coping with each loss. <br /> <br />As usual, you get the trademark twists: just as Ned's death and then Robb's stunned you when you read them, there will be times when Martin unfolds a scheme that takes you aback. That was really what set him apart from the likes of Robert Jordan, Martin was willing to kill his characters. Perhaps there was nothing as shocking in this one as the Red Wedding, but trust me, he keeps things rolling. <br /> <br />So if you've read and loved the series thus far, you will enjoy the continuation. You might miss a character who didn't make the cut, but just think, that means double of him in the next one.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|this dude went to berkely school of music...that is not where you learn to play the blues!Blues comes from the soul, not a textbook and a chord chart. He is so phony . The vocals on this album are not gruff or sincere enough for blues, theyre fine for his acoustic singer songwriter thing, but not for this style. The band as a whole is fairly loose. It sounds like 3 individuals , who while all talented, are not a \\"band\\". He shouldnt do any more Jimi covers, its atrocious . Dont attempt a song by a master unless you can do it justice. Overall i was highly disappointed in what i heard, although it was what i expected,...decent guitar work and rhythm section with mediocre songs and vocal execution.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|The trouble with Christmas albums is that by December 26th they are usually consigned to the CD rack for 11 months -- I fear this may be another.  However, it is a nice album,with good, sensitive arrangements; both with the Clayton~Hamilton Jazz Orchestra{which gets one of the stars awarded this cd) and also with the string section. Diana Krall always exudes CLASS and this album is no exception.  It`s also \\"cute\\" that she finds it difficult to pronounce her \\"R`s\\" (Cwistmas; awound etc). This CD would be ideal as background dinner music or for a late night,romantic drive.  It`s not a great jazz album, but it certainly has good jazz tinges and it is very tasteful.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|ive always been a Clapton fan, but leaned more towards his solo efforts, never having paid much attention to Cream(i was an infant when they were formed), so other than the old warhorses like \\"badge\\" \\"sunshine\\" and \\"whiteroom\\" i was largely unfamiliar with the songs in the setlist.   i bought it on the strength of Claptons playing, i figured it had to be good!    when i first watched it and saw Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker walk out i thought \\"now how good can these geezers be\\" esp. Baker, he looks like hes ready for a nursing home, but man was i wrong!   <br /> <br />Bruce is a great bass player and Baker just blew me away with his drumming, that old dude is BAD,  then theres Clapton, he really had to stretch himself out here with only a bass and drums behind him instead of the full backing band as in his solo tours.  Eric Clapton is a guitar God, hes definately top 5 of all time.     too bad that there are no plans for a full tour from cream.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Then why not get CONFESSIONS on a DANCE FLOOR and see what all the rage is about? Madonna has once again reinvented her image and this collection of future hits is as amazing as her early albums in the 80s were and as Ray of Light and other more recent works!  <br /> <br />Madonna may have grown older and more conservative (thank God)  but this album demonstrates that she can still be a mover and shaker!

B000B8QEZG|3.0|Just kidding.  Madonna started out as cutting edge dance/disco, and this is where she has tried to make her come back, of sorts.  Her best work lately has been dance music, invigorated or even redefined by outstanding producers, that seem to rewrite her songs in the process.   <br /> <br />This is a collection of catchy but trite dance grooves that borrow and steal from early 80s/Giorgio Moroder era disco.  Unfortunately this was around the time when she was last relevant, and this disc will not change that.  It is a little onanistic to steal from a musical style that was the origin of her own career 20 years ago.  Here, she revives early 80s disco, which Kylie Minogue and Madonna herself circa Ray of Light/Music, have already done better.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is copy protected! I can't use it the way I want to (in the car, on my work pc, on both my home pc's, extracting songs for my party compilations and so on (i never bring original discs out to a party)) so I sent it back. <br />The only way you and I can tell the record companies that we don't like the way they're kicking our butts adding this sort of \\"technology\\" is by returning their crippled discs back to the store, or even better, steer clear of buying them. The latter is pretty hard since the record companies are denying the online shops to _mark_ the releases as crippled (copy protected). <br /> <br />I support the artists, it's the record companies that needs a wake-up call! They slept in the class (the nineties) when the digital stuff took off and we're now paying for their blunders. <br /> <br />Sad, really. The only business making money of this mess is the postal service (by shipping crippled items back and forth).
B000001FCB|5.0|This is a special disc. When Elis sings Jobim it's the supreme pleasure. For those who like Brazilian music this disc is essencial. Elis gives her best interpretation ever. She exceeds the expectations. Her way of singing \\"&Aacute;guas de março\\" is the ultimate gift for our soul. It's difficult to choose the best music because all of them are \\"the best\\". But \\"Retrato em branco e preto\\" is unbelievable. The \\"Maestro\\" plays the piano and both - Elis and Jobim - deliver the most beautiful music ever. If one wants to have one disc of Brazilian music, this is the one. Attention to \\"Brigas, nunca mais\\" - Elis is pure rhythm. The booklet brings the lyrics in English and Portuguese, and you can see many pictures taken during the recording. It's worth and it's a great present to someone you love.
0553801503|3.0|First, let me confess that I am a huge fan of this series and I think the creativity, complexity of characters and intriguing plots makes this one of the two or three finest series in this genre.  That being said, shame on you Mr. Martin.  Feast could have been written in 6 months.  It's a transitionary novel and not much happens.  All the other reviews here are correct: <br /> <br />- Not much happens <br />- Lots of wandering around <br />- Poor choice of which character POVs to include <br /> <br />Overall, much ado about nothing.  I don't know whether this poorly edited beast is the fault of an author who has gotten lazy and has stopped striving or whether the blame falls at the feet of a greedy publishing house who wanted to cut one story into two in order to sell more books.  Either way, I am sorely disappointed and will not have to wait with baited breath for the next book. <br /> <br />Very disappointed fan.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This film is an extraordinary, timeless classic, and with the incredible technology in this DVD release, everything comes to life. It's a joy to watch, as it always was, and now looks even better than it did on film. Simply a superb tribute to the wonderful people that created this orignial film, and the brilliance of the people that give it larger than life quality on DVD. Would make a great gift anytime!
B0001AP12G|4.0|even though bought this CD bout a year ago I still l it. At first I was like \\"o great another wannabe rapper!\\" But after I heard Through The Wire I was still skeptical but then I saw a sale for him so I decided to buy it and I was like WHOA THIS GUY'S RAPS ARE HOT!!! <br /> <br />Intro- Just a regualar intro i guess...N/A <br /> <br />We Don't Care- This song is probably one of best songs in the album. It really talks bout the hood on school. It has a really great beat and catchy chorus. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Graduation Day- Well at first the skit i weird but at the end It gets good on the singing! N/A <br /> <br />All Falls Down- I actually really like this song. Sylenna Johnson is good on the vocals in the song. Kanye's raps are hot as well. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />I'll Fly Away- Um...GOSPEL SKIT!!! singing is good though N/A <br /> <br />Spaceship- The chorus doesn't really hit me and the beat isn't that great but the raps are tight. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Jesus Walks- One of the tightest rap song in HISTORY!! This song actually talks about somthing apart sex, drugs, hos, and bling!! 10/10 <br /> <br />Never Let Me Down- This song actually kinda speaks to me. The background music really matches with the song. Hov and J-Ivy really do good in this song. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Get Em High- I'm not really into this song. The only thing I like about the song is the beat and Common haha! 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Workout Plan- Hey u gots o 6pack Shakur u know what I'm sayin? HAHAHA!! that's the only thing I like N/A <br /> <br />The New Workout Plan- I don't why but I really love this song!! HAHA!! It just shows his more fun side.

Not really a difference from Twista's but I still LOVE IT!!!10/10 <br /> <br />Breath In Breath Out- This song the best but it's addicting to listen to. It's really weird too. Ludacris is pretty good in this song. 8/10 <br /> <br />School Spirit Skit 1- This is stupid but it's funny at the same time HAHA N/A <br /> <br />School Spirit- I think this beat is tight but Kanye is average on this one. 8/10 <br /> <br />School Spirit Skit 2- Read 1st one N/A <br /> <br />Lil Jimmy Skit- Um.....yea weird. Too bad no one will do that in real life unless they have no life HAHA!! N/A <br /> <br />Two Words- Mod Def and Freeway are tight in this song. The Harlem's Boys are tight as well. 9/10 <br /> <br />Through The Wire- By Slow Jamz, Jesus Walks, We Don't Care, and New Workout Plan, this is one of the hottest too!! I really didn't beleve his mouth was wired when he made this song!! 10/10 <br /> <br />Family Bussiness- This song is ok not a real hit. Probably a filler. 6/10 <br /> <br />Last Call- This song is pretty good even though it's so frikin ass long!! But if you really listen to it it's really tellin a story. 9/10
B000B7HZXM|2.0|I guess when you cant write songs anymore, you cover classics and showtunes for 40something stay at home moms.  Who buys his 'songbook' collections, do you know anyone who owns one?   <br /> <br />Rod Stewart as a solo artist once made vibrant, frantic music somewhere between disco and rock.  'Young Turks' 'Do ya think Im Sexy' are edgy classics, that evoke an age and emotion, once you get past the trappings of their era.   <br /> <br />Rod did extend his career for a time by covering unknown songs of great merit 'Some guys' 'Downtown Train'.  But it is just sad when there is nothing left in the tank, and crooning to the oldies, however smoothly, passes for artistic accomplishment.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Consider my rating a strong 4 star. I'm not exactly sure why I fail to give Franz's CD a 5 star rating. After several listens, I believe it's because the CD, as a whole, gets a little repetitive in its musical stylings - just a little.<br /><br />The music is catchy. I was boppin' my head and just having a great time. What makes me chuckle is simple; the lyrics are not light and frivolous. It's a fun juxtaposition of catchy music and fairly serious/angry lyrics. The tone, at times, almost had me wondering if the lead singer was sneering at the listener.<br /><br />One can hear bits and pieces of different bands from the seventies and eighties - new wave. Overall, this is a great listen. I will be purchasing their 1st CD.

B00003CXAW|5.0|I had the good fortune to have seen this film in a theater with a bunch of other frightened and spellbound kids at a matinee revival back in the 70s. Ever since then, I've made it a point of being somewhere near a TV whenever it was shown. Thank God for DVDs. <br /> <br />This is WAY cool! We all know the story and could wax poetically about Kong buck-wilding on Skull Island and New York City, fighitng planes, et. cetera. Of course, this version contains the subway crashing scenes and the monkeying with Fay Wray that was edited from theatrical versions until recent years, but trivia and film geeks will go ape (sorry, I just can't help it)over the revival of the famous lost spider fotage. Just as scary as I imagined it. Next best thing to finding \\"London After Midnight.\\" <br /> <br />I'd say this is the ultimate DVD of the simian screen star. I could do without the one that ties this with the Krappy Kong Kopies \\"Son of Kong\\" and the anthropiod abomination \\"Mighty Joe Young.\\" Bring your buddies over AND the kiddies to really have a evening for all at your house with this one that's more fun that a barrel of...(no, I won't go there)!
B00000I49J|5.0|JMC came out of nowhere in 1985, and rarely left my turntable.  I think I was the only junior high schooler in Houston who had ever heard them.  60s pop through a layer of distortion, led me immediately to Velvet Underground, one of their influences.  Darklands, there 2nd work, is cleaned up but contains the same classic 60s stylings.  \\"Beach boys on acid\\" may have been their tag line, but the Beach Boys should have been so lucky as to write some of these songs.   <br /> <br />JMC purposefully took riffs and lyrics straight off other records as musical allusions, before turning them sideways.  On April Skies, 'Hey honey what you trying to say' with exact chords, is from Chuck Berry.  Even Frankie Valli is not spared on side 1.  These were only inside jokes for other guitarists/music connesuirs, showing their influences, as JMC sounded truly original while paying homage to 60s pop in black leather. <br /> <br />I suspect reviewers that compare this or Psychocandy to later works, never heard JMC at that time.  Every record after this was a pale, pale shadow.  The simple chord structures and melodies here are pure genius.  Later recordings were more polished and complex, but this always seemed a crutch when this level of songwriting left them.  On Darklands, the philosphy seems to be, why say in 4 chords what you can say in 3.   <br /> <br />Everyone with a guitar learns the chords and progressions in one month of playing, that JMC relied upon for nearly every one of their classics.  So why is such timeless songwriting as this one in a million?  This was a question asked about Bob Dylan's 'All along the Watchtower', and the same can be said of JMC here.   <br /> <br />As proof to their own genius, they never wrote a single song that can sit side by side with the cuts on Darklands.
B0000046JP|5.0|I grew up listening to the version of Aranjuez played by John Williams as it was one of my father's favourite pieces of music and  became one of my own. I thought Williams version was stunning but now having listened to Aranjuez played by Paco de Lucia, Paco brings something extra to the music, an Andalucian understanding, a flamenco spirit, and such incredible technique, lightening fast fingers that melt into a blur.<br /><br />All in all, the spirit in which the music is played, in comparison makes Williams superb interpretation appear dull and robotic. This is surely how Rodrigo intended his concerto to be played.<br /><br />Paco de Lucia is an absolute genius and is to my mind without equal as the world's best guitarist. If you've never heard of Paco de Lucia before, you could do a lot worse than begin your discovery with this album.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I don't know whether to give this CD 3 stars or 5, so I'll cut the difference at 4. I admit, I'm writing this review on a whim.  I only just bought the CD yesterday, and have been listening - and puzzling over it - ever since.  I bought the first Gorillaz album when it came out, and Demon Days is much in the same mold, and yet while Gorillaz debut album was a little quirky and weird, it was mainly a quirky adventure into a new genre of music, something like techno-inspired mix of rock and hip-hop, and it was treated as so.  There was no serious subject material, nothing heavy or complicated about it, which worked, although made for a rather forgettable album.  Demon Days, on the other hand, expands on what their debut album started, building on the potential of this strange new music, and once again, Gorillaz finds themselves in unchartered territory. <br /> <br />Musically, the record is just as genious as the last one.  Their style is utterly unique and their sound, while as one reviewer said \\"an acquired taste,\\" is actually entrancing and addictive, and offers something for anybody, whether you like techno, rap, rock, or country, there is a smattering of flavors from all over the musical spectrum.  Often times, this makes for a very fun listening experience, but occasionally, it lapses into grindingly irritating repetition, or at times, something that is just down-right too weird to get into.  \\"O Green World,\\" a song that starts off with a minute long introduction of heavy basslines, techno \\"beep-bops,\\" and horror-movie like production, is a song I'm forced to skip almost every time.  On the other hand, songs like \\"Dirty Harry\\" or \\"Dare\\" sustain a very entertaining beat and off-brand production, that works, partly because they don't overdo any one technique.  \\"Feel Good Inc,\\" a song that most everyone has probably heard is, in my opinion, one of the catchiest songs on the album, and is one of the more melodically inclined cuts as well.  Sadly, however, there arenever two songs on this album that sound alike, and the closest you'll come to that \\"Feel Good\\" sound is \\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven.\\"  All in all, it takes getting used to, but it's an experience worth having. <br /> <br />Lyrically, however, is the sticking point I have a hard time getting past.  Just let me say, what on earth is going on here?  Gorillaz, while navigating new musical territory, seems to have gone in a similar direction lyrically.  That is to say, making everything they say so obtuse and strange, you have to work extra hard to wrap your mind around it.  I can't tell if they're lyrically brilliant, or simply careless.  There are times when the lyrics make a skewed, clever sort of sense, such as rapper-extraordinaire with more aliases than a graffiti artist, MF Doom's verse on \\"November Has Come,\\" a song with a lulling, floating sound.   Doom's lyrics vaguely hint at some his unrest with hip-hop now-a-days, in a parody like manner, and yet it's hard to be sure that's what he's really saying.  \\"Blew the whole spot/Like some old a** with skunk meat/These kids is too fast/Juiced off of junk treat/Who could get looser off a crunk or a funk beat?/\\"  It's very, very strange.  In fact, EVERY song on this album is very, very strange, and at times, I can't make heads or tails of WHAT ON EARTH they're saying. Take for instance \\"All Alone,\\" a mind-baffling track.  See if YOU can make sense of this.  \\"we happy or we lonesome/the long jump, the beat heart, from start to finish/ten spoons of spinach/the soul and the spillage/the cup that runneth ovah/we turn up the o-god!/\\"  Sometimes I think they're lyrics are bitingly clever because of their obscurity, and others, I have to wonder just what they were thinking while composing this album. <br />

B00000JZI9|5.0|If you judge movies by John Wayne or Clint Eastwood, you'll hate or think this movie's okay.  If you actually just watch the film and not compare it to any Spaghetti Westerns or the Duke, you'll agree it's simply one of the best westerns of the modern era.  Great screenplay and cast, no pretention or egos to get in the way, and our modern day power actors at their humble beginnings make way for simply a great movie.  Kevin Kline at one of his best roles, a YOUNG Kevin Costner, Danny Glover, Jeff Goldblum, and even John Cleese for a few chuckles round out an all star (nowadays) cast with an authentic feel.  Kasdan has been known for his revival of genres, this is certainly no exception.  Must see movie!!!
0553801503|5.0|Before I get onto explaining why Jon Snow is almost certainly the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark (and therefore the nephew of Daenerys) here's my review...    I have never, ever been compelled to write a review of any of George R R Martins `A Song of Ice and Fire' series before because everything I have to say about those 3 books has already been said hundreds of times already. They are masterpieces. This time, however, its strange because the overwhelming impression I get from some of the reviews is that a few people almost WANT George R R Martin to fail, they want the series to become a disaster, which I dont quite understand. The comparisons with Robert Jordan are very unfair. Whereas Jordan has impressively achieved something no author has ever attempted (Hundreds and hundreds of pages of people tugging their braids, smoothing their skirts, drinking tea and frowning  for the last 7 books and losing 90% of his readership along the way) to suggest Martin is heading the same way is not even close. Martin cares alot for the quality of his work AND for his fans (Just take a look around his website [...] and you'll see what I mean) and reading this book makes you feel like as if Martin was writing more for US then himself. Why? The first 3 books didn't elaborate much on the history of the different cities and histories of the Houses, while this one does. The overall feeling you get is of a world that is more `lived in,' where you are a part of the world instead of being someone sitting on the fence and watching. I felt much more involved.    A Feast for Crows is a marvelous book from beginning to end, but splitting it in 2 has caused problems and you have to appreciate it in a different way. With the first 3 books, if you had a favourite character, say Daenerys, and her chapter ended on a cliffhanger, and you just HAD to know what happens next, but you had to read a Tyrion, or Jon, or Catelyn chapter first, then you did, but then... you just HAD to know what happens to them as well and before you know it... half the night has gone and so has half the book. Needing to know what happens to your favourite character(s) kept you reading and reading and made the first 3 such beautiful books. This time, however, seeing as most peoples favourite characters are removed, it can be a difficult read. If Jon Snow(Targaryen) or Dany or Tyrion or Bran kept you reading the last three times, then you might have a tough time here, as I did.    As some other people have said, this book has no `Plot'. This is true, but it does, however, have a lot of `Plotting,' people being cunning and manipulative, especially Cersei and House Tyrell. Another reviewer broke down the number of chapters each character has. I would suggest this, so that you can enjoy this book alot more. Read all of Cersei's chapters first, and then read all of Jaimes. Go through each character one by one, like that. The good thing about this book is that alot of the character storylines stand independent of one another and you wont get too many major spoilers this way either. No major event happens (as others have said) and you might find it easier to follow what happens in Westeros. Cersei first, then Jaime and then Sansa/Alayne and after that Brienne. After that read The Prophet/The Krakens Daughter/Iron Captain/The Drowned Man/The Reaver/ which will tell you about the events of Iron Islands. After that, read The Captain of the Guards/The Soiled Knight/Queenmaker/The Princess in the Tower.which tells you about the events in Dorne. Finally, read the Arya/Cat of the Canals chapters and then complete the book with the Samwell chapters. You'll find it easier to know whats going on everywhere this way and you might enjoy it more.    Alot of people have said that this book is in need of serious editing, and initially I agreed, but now I say to those people... `Give this another read.' The great thing about Martins books is that they are so very readable and I think if you read through A Feast for Crows a second of third time, it also enriches the first 3 books and changes your perception of some of the characters (like Ser Arys Oakheart and Ser Harys Swift). I think you should give it another chance. Also, many people have criticised Brienne's character but you need to look at her from another perspective, something I feel Martin has deliberately challenged his readers to search for. Brienne represents `True Honour,' by which I mean that she is a throwback to Martins numerous inspirations for the series. Martin loves medieval european history, of Castles and Knights, and of honour where, crucially, `My word is my bond.' Every main character, and I mean EVERY main character, has cheated, lied or broken an oath in some way or another no matter how small, or been manipulative with the exception of Brienne. Catelyn released Jaime Lannister with no permission, Robb betrayed his word and his promise to the Freys, Eddard lied to protect Sansa, thereby costing him his life, Theon Greyjoy destroyed Winterfell... too many examples to list. Even Jon Snow broke his promise to the Nights Watch when he bedded Ygritte. Ser Barristan Selmy, now protecting Dany, also lost his honour when he accepted Robert Barratheons pardon and joined his Kings Guard. For Martin, Brienne is perhaps the last of the true heroes, people who kept their word onto death and where an oath is just that: A pure promise that has to be kept, at all costs. Brienne just needs to be appreciated in a different way and I really like her.    Okay, now, this is just a theory mind you, so feel free to disprove it (although this is not a forum) but I am 99.99% certain that Jon Snow is really Jon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark. There is just so much evidence for it and the reason I said you should read Samwells chapters last is because there is a bit of information that almost confirms it. I always wanted to believe Jon was Eddards son by Ashara Dayne but awhile back I reada webpage which completly blew me away. If you mail me, I'll link you to it.     First, the evidence. You'll find most of it in the first eight ot nine Eddard Stark chapters in A Game of Thrones and a bit from what Cersei says in A Feast for Crows. Upon first reading AGoT, we always assume that Lyanna died because she was raped by Rhaegar. In fact, only one person says this. Robert Barratheon. Eddard NEVER says this, not once. Indeed, there is a strange line later on in the book. Robert discovers Dany is pregnant, much to his fury, and Eddard pleads with him not to kill her. There is a huge fight between them, causing Eddard to resign as the Hand. When he is alone there is this line: `Suddenly, uncomfortably, he found himself recalling Rhaegar Targaryen. \\"Fifteen years dead, yet Robert hates him as much as ever\\"' If Rhaegar raped and killed his sister, isn't it strange that Eddard is unable to hate Rhaegar the same way? Unless Rhaegar and Lyanna were lovers. (A Game of Thrones is too well written for Martin to make slip ups).    AGoT also clouds our impression of Rhaegar because of the words of Robert. However, he is far from the villain we think he is. Later on in AGoT, when Dany orders that all the women be her slaves so as to save them from being raped by the Dothraki, Ser Jorah Mormont says in a throwaway comment, `You are your brothers sister.' And in A Feast for Crows, Cersei is also thinking of Rhaegar fondly and how she wanted to be his wife. Cersei, of House Lannister who betrayed the Taragaryens, whose brother slayed the rightful king... that tells you all you need to know about how pure and respected Rhaegar must have been.    Similarly, the way AGoT is written, we have always assumed that the love between Robert and Lyanna is mutual. In fact, there is no evidence that Lyanna loves Robert as much as we're led to believe. Robert loves Lyanna like insane, still does. However, Eddard recalls a conversation with Lyanna where Lyanna discovers Robert has another illegitimate child and that he will never keep to one bed. She may certainly have had affection for him, but not much more beyond.    We also always assume that Lyanna has died some kind of brutal death, as Eddards dreams repeatedly show Lyanna in `a room that smelled of blood and roses.' But this could well have been that Lyanna has just given birth and she dies shortly shortly afterwards. After all, Tyrion Lannister's (The Imp) mother dies in childbirth and, even more bizarrely, far more bizarrely, so does Daenerys. A coincidence? Just remember, this is George R R Martin writing, not just anybody.    Eddards dreams repeatedly have Lyanna telling him, `Promise me Ned, Promise me.' The first time we are told this is when Eddard takes Robert to the crypts. Ned tells him, \\"`She wanted to come home, to rest beside Brandon and Father.' He could hear her at times, Promise me Ned, she had cried...' We always assume the promise is for Eddard to bury at Lyanna, but analyse the sentence again, does it really seem so? With a war raging, and so much bloodshed, isn't it very selfish to demand such a thing? Later, when Eddard talks to Arya, he tells her that she has Lyanna's wild nature. A contradiction, almost. Also, `Promise me Ned' is repeated far too often in AGoT. It seems like something an amateur writer would do, unless we consider the Promise is for something far deeper.     The Promise is almost surely for Eddard to protect Jon and never reveal his identity. Why? Because Robert would have undoubtedly killed Jon. He hates Rhaegar with a madness, so what chance would Jon have of surviving? Robert would have been even more furious that not only has Rhaegar `killed' the woman he loved, but also fathered a child with her, something he never did, or can. Also, Eddard thinks to himself in one of his early chapters that he has lived with his lies for 14 years: exactly the age of Jon Snow. Likewise, in the chapter where Eddard resigns as the Hand and pleads with Robert not tokill Dany, he thinks to himself: `Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust.' Eddard also loses face in front of the other councillors when he begs Robert not to kill Dany, even at the risk of pushing Roberts anger to the max. Why do this, why even resign as the Hand, especially at this stage? After all, Eddard is investigating the death of a man who was a father to him, Lord Jon Arryn, why risk not discovering the truth of his death? And besides, if the Targaryens ARE killed, then it will prevent any future war, permanently. Unless, of course, there is a direct link between the Targaryens and the Starks.    The only thing that could seriously disprove this theory is Jon Snows appearance. He is a replica of his father, another thing Catelyn hates him for seeing as Robb, Bran and Rickon take after the Tully's but the only son that looks like the father is not even hers. Yet Martin does something in only the way he can. Later on, at Kings Landing, when Arya fights with the Septa and hides in her room, Eddard comes to her (When she shows him her sword, Needle). He talks and says, \\"`Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed it. You remind me of her sometimes. You even look like her.' `Lyanna was beautiful,' said Arya, startled...\\" So Arya looks like Lyanna. And of course, who else looks like Arya? Jon Snow.     Finally, there is something else that struck me as mighty curious about the relationship between Robert and Eddard. Throughout the first 3 books, we are told how wonderful friends they were, how they loved each other, how much laughter there was in the halls of Eeyrie. So why did they only meet once again, in 14 years (when they put down Balon Greyjoys rebellion at the Iron Islands). I think its because if Jon grew up and he looked like either Rhaegar or Viserys (remember, Viserys was 8 when he fled Westeros and his face would be remembered), it would have had severe repercussions, possibly start another war. The journey from Winterfell to Kings Landing isn't so far, unless Eddard is deliberately avoiding Robert at all costs. And Eddard would certainly have protected Jon from Robert, thereby costing many lives in the North.    How does this tie in with A Feast for Crows? There is a little piece where Master Aemon speaks, towards the end, which REALLY makes you anticipate the future books and makes you wonder what is going to happen. At the end of Storm of Swords, Master Aemon and Mellisandre talk about the prophecy of `The Prince who was Promised' and she boldly states that it is Stannis. At the second to last Samwell chapter, Master Aemon says they were looking for the wrong person, that at first they thought it was Rhaegar as a comet was seen in the sky, but then Rhaegar believed it was his own son. (I have the UK Edition and its page 520. Maybe its the same in the USA version). Aegon was conceived at the same time, but so was Daenerys. A GoT tells us that Daenerys was born 3 moons after they reached the Free Cities, and then her mother died. However, Jon was also conceived around this period. Remember, Aegon must have been only a few months old when Ser Gregor Clegane killed him. So though Master Aemon says Daenerys was the fulfilment of the prophecy, it may also be Jon Snow as well.    There is also one other thing to bear in mind. Check out the appendix of AGoT and you'll see that in the House Targaryen line, all the Kings are `pure blood.' They are all from brothers and sisters marrying one another, therefore continuing the line and there has never been any record of a Targaryen marrying outside their own until Rhaegar marries Elia of Dorne. Why is this important? Because it seems that if anyone marries outside the line, the children will not survive. We saw this with Aegon and Rhaenys (Rhaegars children)... and we saw this with Daenerys child too. Khal Drogo was not of royal blood and their child was destined to die. The Dornes are not pure royal blood either, despite their titles. They were never one of the original Kings when the Targaryens landed on Westeros. But the Starks were. In ACoK, when Bran is the Crypts at the very end of the book, there is a tomb for Torrhen Stark, the King who kneeled rather then fought the Targaryens. So IF Jon is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark... well, you see where I am getting at.    Of course, this is all just one big theory but I can't help but feel George R R Martin is pointing us in this direction. What I love about his work is that me makes his readers THINK, something very few writers, fantasy or otherwise, do so successfully. And seeing as Daenerys and Jon are my two favourite characters, I'd like to think they are linked somehow. Oh, and I nearly forgot... Daenreys mother died in childbirth, and if Lyanna is his mother, so did Jon's. Also, their personalities are very similar, two young people the same age with vast responsibility on their shoulders, in charge of their own empires with very little support... Just remember, Mr Martin don't do coincidences.    If anyone is interested in knowing more about this theory, then send me an e-mail. I'll send you proper quotes and page and chapter references from all four books. I have a sort of eassy written on this topic. Thanks for reading this. [...]   If you have your own theories, then please do share as I'd love to hear. If you find this helpful, please do let me know too.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|The first time I took notice of John was on Eric Claptons Crossroads Festival broadcast. it certainly took some [...] to get up on stage with the likes of Eric, BB, Buddy Guy and such. He aquitted himself respectfully and I liked his restrained style, remember as M. Bloomfield so often said,\\"the notes you don't play are often more important than the ones you do\\". That said this album is a breath of Fresh Air. His Style seems to be Hendrixy with some SRV and a little Jerry Miller (Moby Grape). The rhythm section lays down an excellant groove with a free flowing ease. Song list is fun and they all seem to be enjoying themselves, which is what it's all about. I'd like to think we can look for more improvement in the future as the guys continue to jell.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I suppose Firefly does not need yet another rave review, but I cannot resist adding my comments.  (And this is the first time I have posted a review on Amazon.) My wife and I have been watching these episodes on DVD and are frantic because there are only two left to view. Our college-age daughter told us about this show.  I went to see Serenity in the theatre with her and her friends and loved it.  My wife and I got hooked on Firefly with the very first episode on DVD. This series is so good it could have been on HBO. I plan on buying the Serenity DVD and I would gladly purchase any feature-length sequel or any set of additional TV-style episodes.  I fear that the television and motion picture industry is so devoted to producing least common denominator crap that they will not revive Firefly, but if they did, I would buy it.
6305842442|1.0|Blade Runner, in either the original theatrical release OR the director's cut, is one of the best SciFi movies ever made. And yes, the quality of the DVD is DREADFUL. BUT, INHD is showing an incredible print of the director's cut in Hi Def with a real 5.1 surround soundtrack this month. If you have an HD Recorder, here's where it earns its keep! Until the definitive version comes out on DVD, if that ever happens, grab it in Hi Def off the air.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I read some of the reviews in the newspaper and was a little scared to give this comedy a try... but, I recieved as a gift and was TOTALLY blown away- the movie is a Christmastime perfection. A Christmas comedy that all ages in your family will be able to sit down and enjoy together.<br /><br />The movie begins when Buddy- a human raised by elves learns that he is a human. Which explains why he has had a beard since he was 15 and is ten times taller than the other elves. He learns that his real human dad lives in New York City- wanting to know his true father and find where he belongs Buddy leaves the North Pole for NYC. When Walter Hobbs meets his son- Buddy who he has never known about he is a little concerned- he has a a son and wife at home and is a hard-working book publisher who has lost the true spirit of Christmas. When Buddy shows up his whole life is turned upside... at first he chooses to acknowledge Buddy- but slowly decides to take Buddy in out of concern for his mental health- fearful Buddy is crazy... since he walks around in an elf costume, talks about the north pole, and puts sugar on spaghetti. Buddy slowly begins to fit into his family growing close to half brother Michael the two spend time together chopping down Christmas trees and throwing snowballs. Once Buddy begins to fit in- Walter out of anger yells at Buddy causing him to runaway. On Christmas-well all of a sudden Buddy finds himself needing to rely on his human friends and family when he finds Santa's sleigh in Central Park- and needs that Christmas spirit...<br /><br />The movie is cutesy to a point... no one can watch this movie and not be charmed by this movie. There is something very sweet and childlike about Buddy that makes you fall in love with him. Will Ferrell as always is a LAUGHING riot as the Christmas elf that brought him to super stardom.<br /><br />Children will enjoy the story and Buddy. Parents will love Buddy and love the popular culture jokes that kids may not pick up on... No matter how many times I watch this film I always LAUGH at the same parts. This movie will be one you'll enjoy again and again each Christmas and definately one I would recommend you own!<br /><br />The DVD features are possibly the best special features I've ever seen with two disks jammed with games, and interviews... this DVD is hours of fun for you and your children to enjoy.<br /><br />This is NO \\"Christmas With the Kranks\\" or \\"Surving Christmas\\" you'll actually enjoy watching this holiday flick more than once- making possibly the best Christmas comedy movie since \\"A Christmas Story\\" or the \\"Santa Clause\\"Definately a movie to buy or own this Christmas!ck up on...

0783225849|5.0|When I watched this on TCM, I knew this was a classic. But it did not make me one bit scared of the shower. If you really want to see something that will make you nervous of the shower, watch Friday The 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter.
1400031087|1.0|while i agree with frey's discription of what drug/alcohol withdrawal is/can be like,all of the rest of the book rang false.  i've been through rehab, i'm not proud to say, five times, and am currently 3 1/2 years clean and sober.  frey would have been thrown out of the rehab for doing once what her claims to have gotten away with many times: physically assaulting another client (a rehab could get sued over this if they allowed him to stay), destryoying property, having a relationship with another client (jeapordizing that clients recovery/safety), as well as many other thing i won't go into.  i do believe that he had a drug and/or alcohol problem, but there is NO WAY WHATSOEVER that this book is based on fact.  it's sad to think that what could have been an honest account of someone triumphing over tragedy is so much of an outright lie.  hazelton would be out of business and under much leagal trouble if what frey claims went on there were true.  he may be sober, (even that is subject for speculation), but he is an outright liar.---from someone who has beeen there-repeatedly.
B00008WG3U|2.0|I guess their sound is still alive but they are nothing but aging punks with a 15 year old's emotional level and mentality. Like most  other punk albums, this one lacks artistic integrity and an origional sound.
B000005H3A|5.0|In the last year or so, I've truly come to appreciate the second great miles davis quintet: Miles, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Ron Carter, and Tony Williams.  During that time, I've also come to appreciate early acoustic Herbie Hancock.  If it were not for records like TAKIN OFF and MAIDEN VOYAGE, I sincerely believe there never would have been great albums like E.S.P., MILES SMILES, or NEFERTITI.  TAKIN OFF really cooks. <br /> <br />TAKIN OFF is Hancock's first solo effort, and a strong one at that.  The lineup is pretty impressive with Dexter Gordon (tenor sax), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Butch Warren (bass), and Billy Higgins (drums).  I always thought Gordon was a much better sax player than George Coleman, who appears on MAIDEN VOYAGE, and would have liked to have seen him fill that role. <br /> <br />This record opens up with the popular 'Watermelon Man' which would appear again many years later on HEADHUNTERS, sounding completely different.  I actually consider this to be one of the weaker tracks.  Next is 'Three Bags Full' which has a beautifully phrased trumpet solo from Hubbard.  The interplay between Herbie and the Gordon/Hubbard combination reminds me at times of hearing Coltrane playing with Thelonius Monk.  Gordon also shines on this track, sounding comfortable in the setting, with a wonderful solo leading up to Herbie's moment in the sun. <br /> <br />My favorite track is 'Empty Pockets' which open up with Herbie playing the main theme followed by Gordon and Hubbard joining in a few measures later.  Every few measures or so, the time doubles and swings for a few moments.  The first soloist to follow is Hubbard over the main theme, with Gordon later on.  This tracks swings hard at times, and is one of my favorite acoustic Herbie moments.  'The Maze' is another exceptional track - Hubbard really shines here.  I have friends who criticize Hubbard as boring, and while he doesn't match up to Miles Davis or Don Cherry, he is overlooked just as much as this fine record is.   <br /> <br />The music settles down a bit with 'Driftin,' a catchy tune similar to later Hancock, like 'Cantaloupe Island' off the EMPYREAN ISLES album.  This track also has one of my favorite Dexter Gordon solos - you can hear that he listened to a lot of Trane in those days, but then again, who didn't?  The album closes out with the soothing '3am afterhours' sound of 'Alone and I.' <br /> <br />Altogether, TAKIN OFF is a much overlooked gem.  In addition to this album, I also recommend MAIDEN VOYAGE which was from a couple years later and we can hear a constantly maturing Hancock.  After hearing much of his music from this era, we begin to realize how important of an element Herbie Hancock was to the second great Miles Davis quintet.  I'll take Herbie anyday over Red Garland or Wynton Kelly!
B000AGTPUA|5.0|This movie brought me to tears and is perhaps the best Christmas movie since \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" or \\"A Christmas Story.\\"  What's not to like about this movie??? Based  on the classic book- a boy who has begun to doubt Santa exsist and is slowly losing the magic of Christmas hops onbroad the Polar Express and travels to the North Pole.<br /><br />On the train meeting kids who truly believe or having Christmas doubts themselves.<br /><br />Arriving at the North Pole in an unbelievable holiday scene he slowly realizes that believeing is seeing what you can't. Upon meeting Santa and making some friends on the Polar Express. This precious little boy realizes Santa exsists in the hearts of all who believe.<br /><br />Tom Hanks as always in OUTSTANDING performing in mulitply roles in the movie. The animation is simply beautiful better than \\"Finding Nemo\\" or \\"Shrek\\" for each scene and frame looks like your watching an moving oil painting.<br /><br />The songs are beautiful and will get you into the holiday spirit.<br /><br />In short this movie is PURE genius... but, to my surprise the kids in my family did not like the story that much-probably because they could not relate. As an adult- I totally understood the emphsasis placed in the movie- that as you get older the magic slowly dies and the spirit/excitement about Christmas does as well. So when I saw the final scene I couldn't help but cry for I knew that I will NEVER again be able to hear the sound of that precious bell-that rings for those who believe.<br /><br />This movie is a rare Christmas movie- that is solely focused on the true nature/spirit of Christmas. If your an adult you simply MUST rent or buy this movie this season you'll find yourself-wishing you could still believe. 5-Stars All the Way!
B00005JOHI|3.0|I have read all Jane Austen writings(going beyond the six major novels and reading all her letters, unfinished works, minor work - juvenilia, etc.)and have read Jane Austen's masterpiece Pride & Prejudice many times in the past 20 years.  I found this adaptation very disappointing and at times corny because this movie does not capture the true spirit of the book (\\"light and frothy\\") and the sharp and irresistable wit of Jane Austen. I wonder what Jane Austen would have thought of the closing scene (no such corny provision made in the book) where Mr. Darcy plants several kisses on Mrs. Darcy while calling her Mrs. Darcy each time.  One such kiss would have been tolerable, I suppose.   <br /> <br />Moreover, Mathew McFayden's portrayal of Mr. Darcy is quite disturbing because Jane Austen did not intend Darcy to be shy or unsure of himself or wooden or awkward.  Rather, Darcy is supposed to be a little over-confident, arrogant and uncomfortable to be out of his environment and among peasants (at the beginning of the book).  Keira Knightly's acting fares no better.  She did not do justice to the most beloved character of English literature, Elizabeth Bennet who is witty, feisty, vivacious but never forward or desparate.  Nowhere in the book, she asks Darcy if he likes to dance or kissed or would have kissed Darcy's hand, etc.  In addtion, several of the main characters are miscast, notably Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins, Charlotte Lucas. <br /> <br />The best, and truest, adaptation of Pride & Prejudice is still the 1995 BBC production with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth with excellent cast, no deviation from the witty sparkling spirit of Jane Austen, and with a perfect Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.     <br />
B000B8QEZG|1.0|This CD is booboo!  Her last two albums have gone from just \\"wellll\\" to \\"damn that's horrible!\\".......You can chose to buy this album, but I would think most would compare this album as bad and as worthless as a Jenifer Love Hewitt album......TAKE YOUR PICK LADIES AND GENTELMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0553801503|2.0|So....after waiting what seemed like FOREVER (something I did with Mr. Jordan) for the next installment. I run buy it the day of release. Low and behold I find myself able to sleep while reading AGAIN! You know like a movie you can leave for 20 minutes and don't have to pause because you know you won't miss anything. I find myself wondering why I even read the book, so I read it again. Still nothing happened. Here is an author that had me hooked by the second page of each of his last three books. He has taken the.... hmmmm.... say...least interesting of the characters and made us follow the same old hum drum of their lives for what seems like forever. Sorry I am VERY disappointed and have put my collection on ebay just like I did with Jordan. I will borrow a copy of any future books from a friend before I spend any more money on George R. R. Martin. Please redeem yourself Mr. Martin.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|There have been so many movies made based upon \\"A Christmas Carol\\" but this one is the BEST one to own. Who could have guessed the muppets could be in such a heartwarming and endearing version?<br /><br />It's a movie that kids and grown-ups will both enjoy to watch on Christmas Eve with catchy songs, and cute little muppet figures you see \\"A Christmas Carol\\" which could be described as a rather dark- story into one of heartwarmth and sentimental feeling.<br /><br />Kermit plays as Bob Crachitt in this movie alongside Michael Caine who IS Scrooge. Michael Caine perhaps giving his best performance as Scrooge- who becomes changed over the course of one night...<br /><br />The movie is simply joyous and TIMELESS- the muppets are delightful and fit in well with the story. This movie is ADORABLE and the best muppet movie ever made. If your a muppet fan or simple looking for a good Christmas movie to watch definately BUY this movie- it will not disappoint!
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece, Pride & Prejudice.  It truly captures the exuberant and vivacious spirit of Jane Austen as well as her sharp, humorous, and insightful wit.  The cast is excellent, the score is delightful, the settings are superb.  To top all that, Jennifer Ehle portrays Elizabeth Bennet perfectly and Colin Firth is so perfect that he is Mr. Darcy.   <br /> <br />I have read every single published work of Jane Austen's (including her letters and juvenilia) and I dare say she would have been deighted to see this adaptation of her masterpiece and would have definitely approved of it.
B0000669JL|5.0|This is a master piece, and has great songs on.  <br /> <br />BUT i think songs such as \\"Africa Unite\\" from Survival should of made it, along with, \\"Coming in from the cold\\" from Uprising. <br /> <br />Here is my rates for the songs, <br /> <br />1. Is This Love - 8.5/10 <br />- Nice verse and good lyrics. <br /> <br />2. No Woman No Cry - 7/10 <br />- Personally don't know why it is so famous.But good sound. <br /> <br />3. Could You Be Loved - 10/10 <br />- Very nice rythm, and lyrics, i always want to dance to this. <br /> <br />4. Three Little Birds - 7/10 <br />- Happy tune, i would of put \\"Africa Unite\\" there though. <br /> <br />5. Buffalo Soldier - 10/10 <br />- One of my all time favourites. <br /> <br />6. Get Up Stand Up - 9/10 <br />- Very good song, I could really tell how much pain they have had. <br /> <br />7. Stir It Up - 10/10 <br />- Masterpiece. Great love song. <br /> <br />8. Easy Skanking - 7.5/10 <br />- Good, but not famous. I would of put,  <br />\\"Coming In From The Cold\\" there. <br /> <br />9. One Love/People Get Ready 10/10 <br />- Very nice song.Good song choice. <br /> <br />10. I Shot The Sheriff - 9.5/10 <br />- Good beat, also good song choice. <br /> <br />11. Waiting In Vain - 10/10 <br />- Good love song. <br /> <br />12. Redemption Songs - 10/10 <br />- Should be more famous than it is. My favourite Bob song. <br /> <br />13. Satisfy My Soul - 9/10 <br />- Very nice, of the Kaya album from 1978. <br /> <br />14. Exodus - 8/10 <br />- Would of put \\"Slogans\\" there, which is a new release. <br />Good song though. <br /> <br />15. Jamming - 10/10 <br />- One would say the best reggae track ever, very groovy. <br /> <br />16. Punky Reggae Party - 9/10 <br />- Good song but I think \\"War\\" or \\"Concrete Jungle\\" would of deserved that place more. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall I give the album - 9.5/10 <br />I Would of given it 10, but i think they choose some of the wrong songs. But worth buying! <br />
B000001FSR|5.0|Possibly Waits' most unusual work.  It is a very strange mix of polka, rhumba, jazz, folk, blues, rockabilly, lounge, etc. It's pretty much impossible to describe this album in words, it needs to be listened to to be understood (if understood at all).  It is highly experimental.   His orchestration is fiercely imagined and masterfully presented.  It is one of those albums so rich, vivid, bizarre, and beautiful that you realize you were just in the hands of a genius when it finishes playing.  In my opinion it is probably the quintessential Waits album, because it shows so much of his range, perfectly capturing the humor, tragedy, poetry, and charm of his music.  <br />Temptation is one of his all-time greats in my book.   <br /> <br />It should also be noted that I believe this to be, next to Alice, his darkest album.  There's a very creepy and brooding tone throughout.  I think anyone interested in waits' catalogue ought to make this one of their first purchases.
B000002KOO|5.0|First and foremost, Jeremy Spencer does not play on this album. Although a great player, (Kiln House is his best contribution to the band) the sounds you hear were created by Kirwan and Green.  <br />I cant begin to say how fresh this album sounds, every time I put it on. While still able to bring you back to that warm 60's sound, it never sounds dated. This is FM's first serious departure from the straight blues which appeared on previous efforts thanks to, IMHO, Kirwan's presence.  <br />Just a young lad of 20 his maturity as a song writer is brilliantly evidenced in the first track \\"coming your way\\". The song changes from a groovy little number to a heavy ending, reminiscent of I want You (Shes so heavy). Only heavier and louder. From here Kirwan flawlessly moves from said number to the dreamy instrumental \\"my dream\\" and other beautifully sad songs like \\"When you say' and \\"Although the sun is shining\\".  <br />How is it possible for him to get no recognition in the annals of music history? To me its simply an indication that people simply dont know their music, and are too willing to accept the Claptons, Santanas and (insert other overrated player) as \\"the\\" guitar players.  <br />Kirwan constantly gets labelled as \\"Green's protege\\" when in fact Kirwan could keep up with Green's masterful playing as demonstrated on Fighting/Searching for Madge. As a songwriter, Kirwan tapped into music in a way that only the most talented musicians could do. He looked to the past for influece, while still incredibly ahead of his time, writing songs the likes of Cobain would write 20 years later. To write songs like he did, and play as he did, at such a young age, is a testament to his brilliance. <br />Speaking of brilliance, enough cant be said of Green's guitar playing either; not to mention his singing. If he had to leave after an album, Im glad it was this one. \\"Before the beginning\\" is one of my favourite album closers and \\"Oh well\\" has to be one of the greatest rock riffs ever written. Listen closely to Green and Kirwan interplay; these guys were meant to jam together. Page(not overrated)was hugely influenced by Green; just compare \\"Showbiz blues\\" to Zep III.  <br />Green's playing had a raw power, a really special quality that no other guitarist, save Kirwan, could harness. This album demonstrates this ability all too well.  <br />This of course could not be so without one of the best rhythm sections in music history. They are the rare breed of musician who knows when to shut up and when to speak up. Every note, every beat is exactly as it should be. Transitions are flawless, (F/S for Madge, ending of \\"coming your way\\") and this album makes them sound full, heavy and just plain ol' great! <br />Come to think of it, I believe I may have already reviewed this album(or was it Kiln House, Future Games or Bare Trees?...cant remember, but you should get these anyway) Either way, listening to this album does just that; it makes you want to tell people about it over and over again. I hope that this lineup, which is shrouded by that monster \\"Stindsay Buckinnicks\\", will earn their rightful place as the lineup representing this band's creative peak. That is to say, once Danny Kirwan left the band, they lost that sound that made this band so special, and gained two members who were so generic, so bland, so very \\"easy listening\\". Please enjoy!
B000002KIE|5.0|You can argue on and on about how much better the Clash were, or the Buzzcocks or Stiff Little Fingers or The Slits or 999 or Gang Of Four; or Black Flag, The Minutemen or Minor Threat; or the Butthole Surfers or The Flaming Lips; or Nirvana or Mudhoney.  It doesn't matter. Regardless of their \\"authenticity\\",goals, or musical ability of the Sex Pistols, Never Mind The Bollocks is THE punk rock record.  In 500 years, when some kid googles \\"punk rock\\", this record will be the first result.  The dictionary definition, plain and simple. Me and a million others never would have gotten into (or formed) these other bands if they hadn't heard this record (except maybe one by the Ramones).  If you don't get it, drink a six pack of imported beer with someone you wanna' have sex with but haven't and listen to this record/CD.  That's punk rock you're listenin' to.
B000002VMH|5.0|\\"Why\\", in my opinion, is one of the greatest songs ever written and performed. This entire CD is brilliant. Annie Lennox dodged the first solo album jitters by concentrating on what she does best, songwriting and performing the hell out of the material.
B00005JNTX|5.0|The director took a little bit of Pulp Fiction and combined it with some of the gore of Kill Bill to come up with this highly entertaining film.   It is like a dark comic book come to life, shot in black in white, with color only used when the director was emphasizing something. <br /> <br />The main actors Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis are all excellent in different ways.  All three are protectors of the women and act as dark knights to save them.  Additionally, Josh Harnett seems to be floating about as someone who murders troubled women. <br /> <br />The special effects are wild, the violance graphic and the women are very hot!  Don't look for realism in this film because you won't find it.  It is more like a dark fantasy where guys can get shot a hundred times, get hit by cars, jump off buildings and keep coming.  Highly Entertaining and well worth watching on DVD because you can rewind things that you couldn't believe that you saw!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Jeremiah Chechik brought me to this film.  His direction in \\"Diabolique\\" intrigued me.  What intrigued me more was the fact that this film,  like \\"Joon\\",  wasn't my kind of film.  The direction was fabulous.  The writing is insanely good.  All roads in this film lead to fun.  The cinematography doesn't take from the comedic skill in this film.  I adore E.G. Marshall,  his comedic/horror acting was/is grand in \\"Creepshow\\".  You'll also love the teaming of Diane Ladd and Doris Roberts.  Although they don't interact much, they feed off of each other to a great effect.  Chevy Chase is a comedic lovers dream.  Even Beverly D'Angelo is cast well here to compliment Chase.  The irritating and grotesque Randy Quaid is likeable,  yet leavable.  This film has it all for the funny lover.  This film works nevermind the time of year.

B000002U9W|5.0|For a legendary band such as Pink Floyd it's usually pretty easy to pinpoint just where their legendary status comes from.  Undeniably the 1973 \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\" would probbaly be it.  But I some fans and definately a lot of critics forget the transformation that a band such as Pink Floyd had to go through to arrive at their pinnacle of musical competence.   <br />       Competence is a weak word to describe the level of musical talent that went into recording each Pink Floyd album. And the 1970 \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is no exception.  Recorded and released in what would be a \\"middle-of-nowhere\\" stage for Pink Floyd's musical taste this album was starting mold for what would be Pink Floyd's future.   <br />        What I enjoyed most about the staring track \\"Atom Heart Mother Suite\\" was my inability to place it in any kind of genre of my own.  It was progressive, it had a choir and brass, but also some amazing guitar work.  When I finished listening to the first track I honestly felt like I had just crossed the desert.  And this was before I found out that the album was originally supposed to be a soundtrack to a Western.   <br />       The very folksy and mellow track \\"If\\" would probably be my favorite on the album.  It's a song that most people can relate to.  It's a trip with small doses of insanity.  Just enough for us to comprehend and not turn away from the song like it's some sort of foreshadowing tale of what will happen to us all.  <br />       My least favorite but still well written track on the the album, \\"Summer '68\\", has a strong contrast between its highs and lows but there's not much to say about a badly mixed track such as this.  Although it goes over well after listening to a track like \\"If\\".  \\"Fat Old Sun\\" is by far the best written track on the album.  With it's nostalgia filled lyrics and great guitar work the you can't help but love the song.  It's true the track is badly mixed also but the band's reproduction of the song live is something every Pink Floyd fan should see. <br />       To end the album the band decided on a simple track with mostly sound effects called \\"Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast\\".  Most critics have ridiculed Pink Floyd for making such a track because they found it pointless.  Well I was very satisfied by all the sound of water running and sort of coherent and delayed speech from Alan himself.  The few guitar and keyboard parts in this track was truly well done and I believe it was a great ending to an amazing album. <br />       With that \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" was released and paved the way for more progressive, socially engaging music to come from Pink Floyd.  The album is a must for any Pink Floyd fan.  It may be fair to say that it was just way too ahead of its time.
B000BTJDG2|5.0|In a little under a month (as of this writing) one of the year's best movies, \\"The Exorcism Of Emily Rose\\", will be coming out on DVD.  It's coming in two formats - the theatrical edition and the unrated edition, which presents something of a dilemna.  Normally I Always go for the full uncut version of a movie, even if it means waiting a long time, but now in the case of two movies I've seen at the theater this year (this and \\"Dark Water\\") there are unrated editions coming out of what was perfect the first time around.  My curiosity and my instincts are to go with the extended editions (\\"Underworld\\", \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" etc. would Not have been as good with Any of the material in the Unrated Extended Editions absent), but there's a vague fear of 'why tamper with perfection' in this case?  I don't know, maybe I would have felt the same if I'd first seen \\"Underworld\\" or \\"Dawn\\" in the edited theatrical versions, although I can't think of anything that could have been cut from either of those movies that wouldn't have diminished their greatness.  Anyway, the theatrical version is what I've seen, so that's the edition I'm reviewing. <br /> <br />   First of all, if you have any qualms about not seeing this movie because of it true life connections (as opposed to \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", which despite the hype was only Very loosely based on real events, the basis of the story having already been formulated - according to Tobe Hooper - before he ever heard of the Gein case) I'd urge you to see the movie anyway.  I admit to having had some uneasiness myself, unlike with a series such as \\"Amityville\\" which was launched with the support of the people actually involved in the real (I suppose I should say supposedly real, although I find the story credible) events.  \\"The Exorcism Of Emily Rose\\" was based on undeniably real events - whether or not you believe in the possession angle - involving real tragedy, so I did have my doubts. <br /> <br />   Suffice it to say thatthe first half hour of the movie annihilated those doubts completely, and not just because of the super quality of the movie.  I can't be specific without risking spoilers, but I'll say that \\"The Exorcism Of Emily Rose\\" proved to me that not only was it based on events where it was acceptable to make a movie out of it, but advisable. <br /> <br />   Juxtasposing the horror movie, the courtroom drama, and the 'theological/philosophical/ethical issues' movie as if it were the most natural thing on Earth, \\"The Exorcism Of Emily Rose\\" tells the tale of an exorcism gone wrong (not a spoiler; that's apparant from the first five minutes) and the ensuing criminal case charging the priest who presided over the exorcism with negligent homicide.  Told, in about equal ratios, in two timeframes - one leading from the aftermath of Emily's death through to the court case and beyond, the other from before Emily's initial possession through to her eventual death - the movie perfectly brings to life a cast of characters that it's impossible not to care deeply about (helped in no small part by the universally brilliant performances).  The battles in and out of the courtroom are heated, but ironically there are no human 'bad guys' in the movie.  The prosecuting attorney believes in his position, actually more strongly than the defending attorney does in hers, at least initially.  The 'bad guy' element is provided by what happened to the Emily Rose character.  In pursuing the route of an actual possession, few movies have ever come close to being so terrifying in their depiction of true, literal Evil.  And yet at the same time there is an abundance of brightness and inspiration in the tale.  Unbelievable suspense and some unforgettably horrifying moments mixed so fluently with the other side of the coin is in itself a great achievement, and \\"Exorcism\\" hits all the other marks with equal force: outstanding production, incredible visuals, tremendous musical score, superb character interaction, the whole range of everything you could ask for. <br /> <br />   Truly one of the greatest movies of all time, definately one of 2005's very best.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Good movie with lots of gunfights and a good story to boot. Kind of hokie when you see the way the clerics dodge bullets.  I understand that they have learned to play the percentages of where their foes will fire, but by playing the percentages, you are going to lose at some point (ala Las Vegas).  That and the trenchcoats that the armed guards wear at their palace is too B-movie for me.  Other than those two little problems this movie is great.  If you liked the Matrix then you have got to see this movie!
B000AUDHW8|5.0|Congratulations on excellent service!  I've searched for many many years for Yentl, and thanks to daaveedee I've received the DVD within 2 days after ordering from South Africa of all places !  Excellent service.  Very high quality DVD.  Thank you!
B00004R99U|3.0|Okay, so I'm really not getting what people are complaining about with this movie when they liked the original.  Our family HATED the original...found it really boring.  But, overall, we really liked this one.  I wouldn't put it right up there with Nemo or Monsters, Inc., but it's really cute with a fun storyline, and they straighten out the historical inaccuracies a bit from the first one.  Granted, the animation is along the lines of a Saturday morning cartoon, but try to keep in mind that this was a \\"straight-to-DVD\\" production that was never meant to hit theaters.  All in all, I think this is a worthwhile DVD, and our 3 year old LOVED it, including the Hiawatha short in the Bonus menu.
0060528737|5.0|A threat is growing at the Red Lake, and a strange Necromancer, Hedge is unearthing an ancient evil within two silver hemispheres. Lirael; the Abhorsen in waiting, Sam; Prince of the Old Kingdom, Mogget; the catlike free magic being, and the Disreputable dog (who was found in the depths of the Library of the Clayr) head for the Red Lake where Nick, Sam's best friend, is being possessed by the Destroyer. Abhorsen is a thrilling book that anyone interested in fantasy will love.  Fans of Harry Potter, Eragon, The Amulet of Samarkand, Shadomancer, and The Lord of the Rings will find this novel almost impossible to put down. <br />Abhorsen is the third book in the trilogy (following Sabriel and Lirael). I recommend all three of these books and suggest reading Lirael before Abhorsen to avoid confusion. <br /> My favorite part of the book was when Lirael, Sam, Mogget, and the Disreputable Dog make their way through the caves, beneath the Abhorsen's house, to escape the dead surrounding them.  <br /> Throughout the book Lirael has to walk into death. She leaves her body and finds herself in the river of death. Here she uses her bells to control the dead. Lirael is more than the usual Abhorsen. She is also a Remembrancer, meaning that she can look into the past. Abhorsen is a great book which I would recommend to all fantasy fans.  <br />
B0002DB52M|5.0|Dogville is a study of human nature, of how people can react and of how power can corrupt (great film for the times we live in, eh?).<br />  When I first saw this film, I was taken aback by the look of it. The set is very sparce and it looks like a play. Along with the narriation, I was beginning to think I would not like this film, but I was sucked in. The performances are excellent and soon you forget about the name of the road being written on the \\"street\\", the lack of walls, etc and just start paying attention to what is happening in this quite little town.<br />  A terrific film.
0064409422|5.0|I read the Narnia series aloud to my daughter as bedtime stories. We were reading from the boxed set of The Chronicles of Narnia, and we started with The Magician's Nephew. It is an interesting story in it's own right, and I assumed that since it is, after all, the \\"first\\" book in the series, that it should be read, well, first. Only later did I learn that The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was written first. A reviewer pointed out to me that reading The Magician's Nephew first robs the uninitiated reader of the wonder of seeing Narnia for the first time with the Pevensie children. While it is a nice prequel, I would recommend going back to it later, for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is undeniably the jewel in the crown for The Chronicles of Narnia.<br /><br />In our current age of antiheros and self-interest, a trip to Narnia is like a balm. It is a world where honor matters and where even the greatest must sometimes sacrifice. It is a world where ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things and where redemption is always possible. All of these are values worth instilling in our children - all the better that they can be introduced in such an entertaining format.<br /><br />For this book would never have achieved its iconic status if it were not, first and foremost, entertaining. While it certainly functions as an object lesson in morality, as well as Christian allegory, it does this without losing sight of the main goal of children's literature, to entertain children. There is magic in Narnia, but it is subtle. The slow revelation of the power of the characters builds the suspense and keeps the pages turning. The device of drawing ordinary children into an extraordinary world is as enticing here as it was in the first Harry Potter book. It allows a child to envision the events happening to herself. The characters are distinct and memorable, making it a pleasure to read aloud as well. I'm happy to report that my daughter and I went on to finish 6 of the 7, with #7 coming up later this year. All in all, a parent child experience worth sharing.<br /><br />Prior to the movie release, I wanted to read this to my son (age 6).  We purchesed the illustrated collector's edition, and I find that Pauline Baines' artwork fits the story's mood perfectly.  I think that readers will appreciate having these illustrations as the pictures in their minds eye more than the CGI animation that I have seen in the movie trailer.ish 6 of the 7, with #7 coming up later this year.

B0006284JQ|1.0|The problem with Pop music, especially bubble gum pop like Spears, is that after one of her hits gets played a million time on the radio and the simple catchy melody that gets stuck in your head finally fades away, its not something you really want to hear again. In other words, music like this has no lasting power, and even if you liked it when it came out, it is already worn and out dated by now - so why try to buy it all again in a greatests hits collection? Not all Pop is this<br /><br />ephemeral, Michael Jackson and Madonna have been able to generate lasting pop songs, but Britney doesn't have the same weight and her songs lose flavor quickly, as does bubble gum after you chew on it for ten minutes or more.
B00006G8HX|4.0|Why does Star Trek III break the mold of odd-numbered Trek films being bad? <br />First off, it features Leonard Nimoy as the director. This was Nimoy's feature film directorial debut, but his familiarity with the Trek universe and with his fellow actors helped to move the picture along. Nimoy was especially familiar with the Enterprise bridge set, so he was able to set up a number of good camera angles there. Additionally, he was able to give every main and supporting character (except Chekov) a short moment to shine on their own. <br />A defining moment of the Trek franchise occurs when Kirk and McCoy steal the Enterprise. Kirk tells Scotty, Suly and Chekov that they don't have to go with him, and each man tells Kirk they're going. It's that sort of all-for-one attitude that has won Star Trek so many fans over the four decades it's been around. <br />Also, the film had its fair share of drama. Kirk's destruction of the Enterprise combined with the death of his son David make this one of the weightier entries in the Trek franchise. <br />Humor also plays a role in the film. Sulu's line of \\"Don't call me Tiny\\" remains one of the most-remembered bits of dialogue from the films. <br />More interesting tidbits: spacedock and the USS Excelsior make their debuts in this film. Both miniatures would get frequent usage both in feature films and in later Trek spinoff series. Also, the debut of the more recognized Klingon bird of prey made its mark on the franchise. That miniature would get used several times in films and TV shows up through Deep Space 9 and Voyager. James Sikking of Hills Street Blues fame also maede an appearance as Captain Styles of the Excelsior. <br />Special features abound on this DVD. Several folks discuss the realism of terraforming. Cast and crew talk about behind-the-scenes happenings. Michael and Denise Okuda provide text commentary offering further insights into the film's creation. <br />As films go, this Trek feature is one of the better entries in the franchise. The Search for Spock provides an entertaining yarn and a reasonable way for Leonard Nimoy to return to the fold.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|I got nothing against the strokes. However if you're not paying close enough attention their albums tend to blur into one big song. Room on Fire is a good collection of songs but as an album it gets a little sterile. I hope the new album is a little more experimental.
0553801503|4.0|First off, it is difficult to judge A Feast For Crows without reference to earlier novels in the series.  This is a middle-of-the-series book, and naturally suffers in contrast to its predecessors; given that, Martin has made several bold decisions in writting this book.  How successful he is is my discussion here.   <br /> <br />Martin is at his best as a writer once again, with the characters he has chosen to write.  Others have already mentioned that some characters and plots are missing, and that this was a disappointment.  I also felt the lack, at least from a direct perspective.  This is why I subtract a star.  However, there are plenty of hints about the missing folks if you read carefully.  The result is \\"fog of war,\\" where the reader only knows as much as the central character at hand, with information from other perspectives that contrasts or completely contradicts earlier knowledge.  This might be frustrating to read sometimes, but it develops the impending sense of doom hanging over Westeros.  This is absolutely necessary for a mid-series novel. Even if big events have transpired, Martin cannot release the reader from the grip of the larger threat.  Infuriating, for we who must wait years between novels, but also delicious to savor, and very necessary to the tale at large. <br /> <br />Martin's choice of point-of-view characters is always interesting, and the addition of Cersei and Brienne are carefully selected, but nothing like a child's storybook: almost all of Martin's characters are the opposite of fairy-tale heroes, which makes their struggles all the more riveting.  This isn't just the listing of dramatic events, but the real story of the survivors of the Storm, which breathes irony into this particular title (incidentally, everyone wanted Feast to be just that, but they seem to have forgotten that a feast for CROWS is something entirely undesirable!). <br /> <br />Best of all, Martin keeps on fleshing out his world with all sorts of characters, from underjailers to wandering pilgrims to seafood hawkers in the Free Cities, and each character however small leaps vividly off the page.  This is Martin's greatest strength as a writer, and this book actually brings in new peoples, like the Braavosi bankers or Summer Island sailors, in tantalizing ways that hint at larger roles to come.  These glimpses, combined with HUGE new pieces of information being dropped into conversations (Doran Martell's final words in the book made me leap up and cheer) almost incidentally, merit a slow, thoughtful read instead of a page-turner, but A Feast for Crows was written for savoring, not for quaffing! Martin makes the very best out of the middle-of-the-series syndrome, fleshes out the story and keep the suspense flowing strong.  I am waiting with baited breath for A Dance with Dragons!
B00000099Y|5.0|This album was dedicated to the awesome comedian Bill Hicks, who actually opened for Tool back in the 90's, and which lyrics in this album were based upon his comedy. The final song, Third Eye, actually has samples of Bill Hicks performing, and in the inside cover of the album there is a dedication to Bill Hicks as 'another dead hero.' Overall the music is awesome, both dark, heavy and full of emotional capability - either of sadness, anger or both. Anyone who likes Tool should check out their hero, Bill Hick's, on DVD and on CD.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Yes, Walter, you have a bad copy. Return it. This is a 4 1/2 star production to me.     The video from THIS DVD concert, has been re-done, and looks spectacular on modern large TVs. It chronicles an incredible concert, (however I am still awaiting the Delicate Sound of Thunder DVD, another phenomenal Floyd Concert from the late 80s), captured in October 1994 at Earls Court in London, topping off their US tour of April, May and June of 94.     There is a lot of good news and a bit of bad in this release.     YES, the audio is far, far superior to the VHS version which was reverb-y and filled with audience noise and mush. This is pristine, wonderfully remixed from the masters, music. Most artists do NOT bother to go directly back to the original masters. Dave and Co. Did. However, it comes at a slight cost: One of These Days was butchered. They left off all the special fx material following Guy Pratt's bass feature in the middle, leaving Rick Wrights superb, ingenious hi freq, cross channeling space music on the cutting floor, and the wonderful echoplex-like digital delay on Dave's pedal steel guitar was woefully dropped in favor of the more staid, cleaner master mix direct to the board from the instrument. I object, respectfully, David. Put it back.     I know they are thinking about their legacy, and striving for peak musical performance, but, and it's a big but, the deleted track leaves a big hole in everyone's favorite metal Floyd song, flying Pig included. One the plus side, I love the Bootlegging the Bootleggers tracks! On the Turning Away is simply staggeringly good. This was Floyd and Gilmour at the very best, with Dave's strat, and his array of HiWatts turned up loud, and ad-libbing and improving left and right with brilliant material and great lead guitar work, despite the accidental laugh at the beginning of Dave's singing after the a ca pella. Marooned is similarly spectacular. I saw several of their concerts, and this is what they were like live most ofthe time, creative, doing different shows in different cities, even re-arranging the same songs in consecutive nights.     The audio is SO good, you can hear one of Tim Renwicks guitar amp speakers blow a voice coil in one song. That is pretty clean. AND you get the choice of 400 or 600 KBPS audio. That is dandy.     For those familiar with the prior PULSE VHS, this is that concert, just looking and sounding better than you could EVER have imagined. I also really like having the films behind the band, chronicled for closeup viewing to music, in special features. I wish they would have included some material for concert B (which started with Astronome Domine, not Shine On), but, hey, you can't have everything. Simply put, a spectacular concert by a spectacular rock giant. I love it. Now, for Delicate Sound DVD. I say bring it on, Dave, the sooner the better. I love Pink Floyd. Had they left the One of These Days material in, I would have given it a 5. Four and a half stars for a great group of musicians and singers; Pink Floyd, THE premier British music institution of the 80s and 90s. Zep owned the 70s.

B000BM6AVA|3.0|I'm disappointed with this new System of a Down release.  I've been listening to SOAD since they released their first album, and I don't really have a problem with the stylistic changes that have taken place so far.  Growth is good. <br /> <br />That said, this album loses one star automatically for the song \\"Lonely Day.\\"  Specifically, the lyrics: <br /> <br />\\"Such a lonely day <br />And it's mine <br />The most loneliest day of my life <br /> <br />Such a lonely day <br />Should be banned <br />It's a day that I can't stand.\\" <br /> <br />Actually, make that two stars. <br /> <br />Terrible, absolutely terrible.  Besides being cheesy and sentimental in a bad way, (if being cheesy in a good way is possible) how can you publish something using a line like \\"The most loneliest day of my life.\\"  Most.  Loneliest.  Redudancy, what?  I don't even consider myself a grammar nazi, but come on! <br /> <br />And don't even bring up poetic license as an excuse.   <br /> <br />It made me cringe the first time I heard it.  To the point of skipping that track.  Every time.  Ranks right up there with \\"Why don't presidents fight the war?  Why do they always send the poor?\\" <br /> <br />Lyrically, the album(s) tend(s) to miss.  I don't know what the reason for this is.  Trying too hard? <br /> <br />I don't recall such poor lyrics in the first two albums.  I mean, they've never been Shakespeare, but the lyrics on this album are low even for SOAD standards.  Maybe I'm being a bit harsh.  Maybe System of a Down don't have standards. <br /> <br />Daron's voice: nasal, but ok.  He and Serj work best with the harmonies though.   <br /> <br />Songs: Overall, a weak bunch.  \\"Attack,\\" structurally, is awesome.  But hearing \\"attack attack attack\\" over and over lessens the effect.  Not too big of a problem though. <br />\\"Dreaming\\" is OK, but doesn't particularly stand out. <br />\\"Kill Rock N' Roll\\" suffers from some more terrible lyrics, but is OK. <br />\\"Hypnotize\\" is excellent. <br />\\"Stealing Society\\" is fun in the beginning, and then is forgetful, and then fun at the end. <br />\\"Tentative\\" and \\"U-Fig\\" are solid. <br />\\"Holy Mountains\\" is not, I repeat, not \\"Aerials pt. 2.\\"  Avoid such lofty comparisons. <br />\\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" is probably my favorite song on the album.  System of a Down stop trying so hard, and yes, it's lyrically devoid of anything, but at least they're having fun. <br />\\"She's Like Heroin\\" is more or less forgetful. <br />\\"Lonely Day\\" needs no more mention.  Make it stop. <br />\\"Soldier Side\\" saves everything.  An epic song with great instrument work.  Tying it all back into the opening song from Mezmerize.  I got chills.  Kudos. <br /> <br />Right, so, there you have it.  A couple good songs, mostly forgetful, and definitely not a consistent album. <br /> <br />I think they should have skipped the double album idea and made it one solid disc.  The playlist should have been something like this: <br /> <br />Soldier's Side - Intro <br />Attack <br />BYOB <br />Revenga <br />Hypnotize <br />Cigaro <br />Holy Mountains <br />Vicinity of Obscenity <br />Radio/Video <br />Question! <br />This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm in This Song <br />Sad Statue <br />Soldier Side <br /> <br />The inclusion of BYOB and Holy Mountain are debatable, I suppose.  And U-fig and Tentative could easily fit in there, but I didn't want to spend too much time debating.  And the list is, of course, subjective.  You know what?  Make your own list.  Just don't don't put \\"Lonely Day\\" in there.  Please.   <br /> <br />Bottom line: I tend to enjoy Mezmerize more.  Toxicity a lot.  And self-titled, the most. <br /> <br />Buy it.  Listen.  Disagree.  Either or.   <br /> <br />Bottom, BOTTOM line: see them live.  Best show ever. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B5UL7G|5.0|I'd regard myself as a staunch Robbie fan and I believe that the collaboration with Stephen Duffy,although I was sceptical to begin with, has paid off handsomely for him. All songs on this album are very good. Lyrically I believe Robbie has moved it up a gear and his ego has dropped somewhat and we see a new early 30's Robbie Williams shining through. The song to look out for is \\"Make Me Pure\\" which although seeming light hearted with the lyric \\"Oh Lord ,make me pure..but not yet\\" is a lamentable insight to the mind of Robbie,as he analyses his past. \\"Advertising Space\\" is supreme aswell,but claims that it rivals \\"Angels\\" are grossly overstated. The bee-bobby power of \\"A Place to Crash\\" is very enjoyable aswell,and the choice of \\"Ghosts\\" as the opening single validated. This song is one of those which will be underrated in time. The weakest song is \\"Your Gay Friend\\" but still listenable. Music is strong,lyrics are strong, Robbie has backed up very well from Escapalogy,showing that he is not just an entertainer,but a MUSICIAN! Must buy
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I was really worried about this album, as I did not like the direction SOAD took with \\"Mesmerize.\\"  In order of likeability, for me, SOAD's albums have gone chronologically from first album being the best, up to their last release, \\"Mesmerize,\\" being my least favorite.  Thank you SOAD for breaking from that path. <br /> <br />This album is absolutely 100,000 times better than the first half, \\"Mesmerize.\\"  I think that the secret to this is that they moved a little bit more towards melodic sounds and good harmonies and rhythms like they did at the beginning of their career.  SOAD has always been a band of fking goofy lyrics, from \\"Sugar\\" to their latest psychosis on Hypnotize entitled \\"Vicinity of Obscenity.\\"  Say what you want about the lyrics \\"banana, banana, banana terracotta pie,\\" but that song kicks ass. <br /> <br />This album gives a good range of SOAD's abilities also.  Daron proves again that he plays some consistent rhythm guitar in some extremely precise riffs and tremolo picking.  It isn't grandiose, but it is definitely catchy and great; (the song \\"U-Fig\\" comes to mind).   <br /> <br />Finally, Daron has died away a LITTLE bit on the singing side and is dominantly back to harmony, which I think he does tremendously.  Malakain is not a lead vocalist, nor should he ever be, and I still think he is being used too much as a lead singer.  Serj is absolutely one of the greatest, most eccentric and most unique vocalists in modern rock/metal, and to think he is being put on the top shelf to Daron is sickening. <br /> <br />I agree in some respects with other reviewers that this album is not like old SOAD, but I think it is back to the great vocal harmonies they had on \\"Toxicity.\\" <br /> <br />This album, also, is a very political album, probably even more so than their last one, with almost every song having some type of anti-war message.  I personally don't agree with many of SOAD's political opinions, but I love their music, so it doesn't bother me.  Don't letanyone tell you what to think. <br /> <br />Another very amazing track is the extended version of \\"Soldier Side,\\" the intro from \\"Mesmerize.\\"  They expanded this song in a very beautiful way. <br /> <br />Thanks SOAD, for turning back to what you do best. <br /> <br /> <br />Highlight tracks are: Attack, Hypnotize, U-Fig, Vicinity of Obscenity, Soldier Side
0740748475|5.0|My love of Calvin & Hobbes began at a young age in the late 80's.  For me, every Sunday was like christmas morning...I'd get up early to run outside, grab the Sunday paper, and tear it apart looking for the comics so I could get my weekly fix of Calvin & Hobbes (much to my mother's consternation).  I was too young to get ALL of the jokes, but I remember laughing hysterically to the \\"Spaceman Spiff\\" and \\"Snowman building\\" stories...so much so that I ended up making my own \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\" snowman, minus head, until the neighbors complained and my mom made me tear it down :)<br /><br />I rediscovered C & H later, when I picked up one of the treasuries.  Being older, I discovered that it was one of the most intelligent, thought provoking strips I'd ever read.  Not to mention the funniest.  Hobbes dry, sarcastic wit had me rolling, along with Calvin's \\"it's all about me\\" attitude.  His interactions with Suzie Derkins, Miss Wormwood, and his parents were classic.  But for me, the best of all of them was Calvin's intricate fantasies....the repeating theme of Calvin as a dinosaur laying waste to his home town was a particular favorite.  His dissertations on living life to the fullest, while flying down a hill in his wagon at reckless speeds, were as thought provoking as they were funny.<br /><br />When Bill Watterson ended Calvin & Hobbes in 1995, I actually mourned as if I'd lost a good friend.  No strip since has effected me the same way.  I own most of the treasuries, and I've re-read them many times over, and discover something new everytime.  If you like thought-provoking comedy and social commentary, along with the most beautiful artwork I've seen in a daily strip, this box set is for you.  You will not be dissapointed.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead had to be on drugs while creating 'Amnesiac', and you can tell right from the get-go. The album is just so weird, you have to listen to it a good 5-10 times before realizing, \\"W...wow.\\" And before you can tell this is Radiohead, you're going to have to go back and listen to 'The Bends', 'OK Computer', and 'Hail To The Thief'. Then you're going to say, \\" I might as well give Amnesiac another chance\\" after you find it in your closet. You'll brush off the disc and put it in your CD player. And you're going to like it much more. <br /> <br />                 Well, at least I did. <br /> <br /> \\"Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box\\" is not the typical Radiohead. It starts off with some ethnic drums, followed by an electronic beatbox. I'll put it to you this way; if you heard this song on the radio, you wouldn't know it was Radiohead until you heard Thom Yorke. And even then, you would probably think it was one of Yorke's side-projects. Many bleeps and bloops and stutters later, and after hearing Thom drone \\"Get off my case...get off my case\\" about 65 times, the album will quiet down and a soothing piano melody will go in one ear and out the other. Then comes Yorke's amazing voice. You'll know offhand that you are being graced by the presence of \\"Pyramid Song\\". This is one of Radiohead's most famous singles, and it shows what Radiohead is really made of. What critics call the 'Thom Yorke whine' is actually a beautiful instrument used to capture the real Radiohead emotion. I really started to like this song the second time around, so please give it another chance. <br /> <br /> Radiohead's album will stop sounding like Radiohead right after 'Pyramid Song'. 'Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors' really shows the influence of drugs. It is an experimental song that sounds more like Richard D. James' techno. The drum really drives the song, while the robotic stuttering and the pads only seem like an accompiment. That's probably because the drumming is way too loud. Thissong was a dissappointment, but the next song more than makes up for this flaw. <br /> <br /> \\"You And Who's Army\\" is a slow rocker-type song. The low-fi effect on Thom's voice makes him sound like Blur's Damon Albarn. I love Blur, so this is not a bad thing at all. It starts out slow, so Amazon's 30-second preview won't justify the rock part of this song. \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is another great song (I made a rhyme! Hello, new Radiohead songwriter!), with a more rock edge than past songs on this album. This is the song that makes you think, \\"I'm glad I didn't throw out that old CD!\\" The \\"I don't care whether or not I get airplay...let's be underground!\\" sound screams all other this album, especially on 'I Might Be Wrong'. Then, after 'I Might Be Wrong', you get 'Knives Out', which might just be the best song on this whole darned album for the people who liked OK Computer. This sounds more like a Paranoid Android follow-up, which isn't bad at all. It's just so emotional...and soft...I just want to HUG THE SONG.  <br /> <br /> You're not going to like \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" from the beginning unless you love ANY RADIOHEAD song ever created. But I urge you to give the song another chance. If you listen to it another time, you're going to like it much more, even though the lyrics aren't too heartfelt. Thom's voice can bring life out of the most boring songs ever! (Hey Thom...would you like to cover Duran Duran's Big Thing?) After you get through the choir-tastic \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\", you suddenly leap from Heaven to the Underworld with \\"Dollars And Cents\\", an ominous masterpiece that only Radiohead could pull off. It's a great song, I'm telling you...although the guitar chords seem out of place at some parts. <br />  <br /> \\"Hunting Bears\\" is basically a guitar driven song...more like a solo, I guess. It's not bad for a lead-up to \\"Like Spinning Plates\\", which opens up with a spasm of stutters, bleeps and bloops, which lead up to choir sounds and drums. Thom's voice doesn't show up until 2:00, which is when the real party begins! The song continues for another 2 minutes or so, and then you hear Life In A Glasshouse, which is a subpar song. I never really liked rock groups doing jazz, but Radiohead does a good job. Yorke's voice just seems out of place for some reason! <br /> <br /> Overall, after completing 'Amnesiac' for the first time, you're going to push it away...yet again. You'll have nothing else to listen to for a while, so you'll give it another chance or two. Then it will grow on you, and next thing you know, it will be in your stereo. <br /> <br />THUMB UP/THUMB DOWN FOR AMNESIAC. <br /> <br />*Not reccomended to be your first Radiohead album. Work your way from top to bottom.
B000002H97|5.0|When Metallica released this album in 1991, they had already earned a fanbase that was so strong and dedicated to their music. And since ...And Justice For All hit #6 on the charts, it's no surprise that this album went straight to #1. Produced by Bob Rock, the sound is more solid and polished than the previous albums. What sets Metallica apart from other bands who have taken this route, however, is that the music is still heavy and on their own terms. Yes, the 8 minute prog-metal jams and 220 bpm thrash beats are gone, but the songs sound great with a more simple structure, and it's tight as ever. The bass comes through much better than the previous album, and the drums sound very full without sounding like a Poison or Ratt album. This is not Metallica's angriest or darkest album despite the album cover. But, not only is it one of best records they have ever made, it is one of the best records ever made, period. People who aren't even into metal bought this album, because it was that good. Not all high selling albums are great, but sometimes, high sales can reflect how good an album is, and this is one of those albums. Top songs? All 12 of them. Five full stars for this album.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|The first time I heard 'Soul Meets Body' on Fuse, I immediately thought of R.E.M., a band that I am very fond of. I was afraid to buy this album...mainly because I felt they sounded too much like REM. I finally got around to buying the album, and now I believe that Death Cab For Cutie is more of a good band than I ever would have imagined. <br /> <br /> I wasn't too crazy about 'Marching Bands of Manhattan', to tell you the truth. It's a very, very pretty song...but when I listened to it (in a very tiring mood) it just sounded like a big mess with tracks layered over each other. I like the song much more now that I am 'awake'. It's a very beautiful piece of music; so melancholy and serene. The album really kicks off at 'Soul Meets Body', a song that doesn't get enough airplay around where I live. This is the great dance song that REM wishes they wrote. It is a very good song that I've put on a playlist that includes my all time favorites, like David Bowie and Bloc Party. <br /> <br />  'Summer Skin' is a very difficult song to review for me. It is filled with amazing lyrics and a great melody to back it up...but the way it was produced didn't really appeal to me. I don't know why I don't like it...I just don't. The next song is a Piano/Vocal duet, and might just be the most beautiful song on the album...at least until the midpoint where it gets really fun and bouncy. 'I Will Follow You Into The Dark' is an acoustic song, and another great one as well. The rest of the album is a mixed bag, high points being 'Your Heart Is An Empty Room', 'Crooked Teeth', and 'Brothers on A Hotel Bed'. <br /> <br />In retrospect, I feel really silly for deeming Death Cab an 'REM Clone'. They are one of the most original bands today and remind me of a Canadian Keane...which is a good thing, because I love Keane. I reccomend it to any Keane or REM fans. Or...people who love beautiful music filled with sweet piano melodies and guitar chords that blend in with the singers amazing voice. <br /> <br />THUMBS UP FOR PLANS.
0553801503|3.0|A Feast for Crows <br /> By George R.R. Martin <br /> <br />First of all, I have to admit that I've been looking forward to the appearance of this book eagerly, from the moment I finished `A Storm of Swords'. The trilogy that had been finished by George Martin thus far was so good, as a matter of fact, that until that moment I considered the series the best ever written. No wonder that I ordered `Feast' on Amazon, like no doubt many other fans of the series did, because I couldn't wait for it to appear in Belgian book shops. <br /> <br />Having finished the book now, I can only say that it leaves me with an empty feeling within. This is not the same empty feeling, mind, that I felt after the sack of Winterfell in `Clash', or after Red Wedding in `Storm'. Those were empty feelings provoked willingly by a crafty author. This one is one of disappointment, a feeling of `is that all there is', as a child that has been looking forward for Christmas for months has when it discovers Santa has only brought it a single toffee and some empty candy wrappers. <br /> <br />Perhaps you can consider the child spoiled, and the same thing can be said for me. Perhaps `storm' was just too damn good, too intriguing, enthralling, binding so no sequel could ever match it. But this one didn't even come close. True, Martin's characters are still as well worked out as they have been, but then again the best one for that matter, Tyrion, has been cut out. The same thing can be said for the wonderful (but just as gruesome) world the author has transported his readers to again, but now he keeps us away from the Wall and the lands beyond the Narrow Sea, the places that we all feel are those that really matter for the proceedings of the story. <br /> <br />Besides, nothing happens in the places where Martin does set `action'. And when I say nothing, I mean as few as there can be happening in a book consisting of almost 700 pages. The Brienne chapters were worst: she departs from the capital city,wanders around the Riverlands, she meets some people, she dies an almost predictable death. The same thing goes for the other character's parts: while often entertaining enough to read, there fails to be a real plot. <br /> <br />Perhaps this is due to the lack of real climaxes in this one. `Game' had Ned Stark's death near the end, `Clash' had the Battle of the Blackwater, and `Storm' had the Red Wedding and Littlefinger tossing Lysa Arryn out of the Eyrie. In the last volume however, no such an event occurs. Near the end, Cersei's storyline seems to be building op towards something big, most likely a Tyrell coup, but if this is going to happen, it will be in the 6th (and not the 5th) volume. <br /> <br />This is, as a matter of fact, the overall impression I got from the book: that `A Feast for Crows' is only a warming-up for something greater to come in the next two books. It's not a feast really, a feast would leave you satisfied and happy afterwards, but only an amuse guelle. I'd like to hope that the main courses will be plainer and tastier. <br /> <br />Ruud De Houwer <br />(Ser Rudyll Brax)
B000002HEP|5.0|This was my first Kyuss album, and in retrospect, I wouldn't reccommend this as a first \\"taster\\" purchase if you've not heard anything by Kyuss, get Blues for the Red Sun instead. <br /> <br />However, the fun begins if you like this kind of music. Heavier than heavy and containing more groove than austin powers, this album showcases all of the different facets to Kyuss at once. You see heavy Kyuss, experimental Kyuss, mellow Kyuss and just plain Kyuss Kyuss, doing what they do best, all on one album that refuses to be classified as an album with a specific vibe. <br /> <br />My only irk lies in the way that the tracks are set-up; 3 gargantuan \\"tracks\\" with 3 or 4 songs within each. You do get an albums-worth of music, but sometimes specific tracks are buried within others, should you happen to be in the mood for just one song. <br /> <br />On the plus side of that, though, it means that the CD stays in the player for the full album, and believe me - that's no bad thing. Awesome.
B000063DI9|5.0|This album has always been on the top of my list.  Well-written songs and top notch production.  The songs are full of true Maiden energy and spirit.  Worth the purchase by all means!  Nobody today in their category can rock out like this. -Mike [...]
B00062IVKI|5.0|This is a combination of the old school and the new school of film making.  This is definitely not your typical Martin Scorsese film.  Scorsese has decided to pay tribute to the classic MGM musical but with a Scorsese touch. <br /> <br />This is a typical boy meets girl boy loses girl movie musical.  He's a saxophonist and she is a singer but her talent is greater than his.  Ala mama Judy's, A Star is Born, he cannot cope with wife's greater success and ala The Way We Were, they're truly in love but can't live together. <br /> <br />This is the Director's Cut with an extra 26 minutes of story and song than the original 1977 release. It has the fully restored Happy Endings musical number which was reduced to 3 minutes in the original release.  Liza can thank mama for this, as this reconstruction was a direct result from the success of the restored A Star is Born (which had its Born in a Trunk sequence restored.) <br /> <br />This is Liza Minnelli's  best film since Cabaret and her last great starring role.  She is helped along with a great score by Fred Ebb and John Kander including the standard Theme from New York, New York.  Liza's original make's Sinatra's version look limp.   <br /> <br />Scorsese does well with this change of pace film.  His vision of 50's New York City and 50's movie musicals is extremely well realized. <br /> <br />De Niro plays the typical De Niro but that's the character.  Most of the other actors come and go and have no real parts but it is fun to see a pre Hart to Hart Lionel Stander as Minnelli's agent. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br /> <br />There is a brief introduction to the film by Scorsese (Tip: Exit from the Special Features and it will ask you to if you want to see the introduction - This will put the into with the film. Otherwise, the into will run only. <br /> <br />Audio Commentaries by Scorsese and film critic Carrie Rickney.  I did not listen to either of these. <br /> <br />There is a series of Alternate Takes, extended takesand Deleted Scenes.  These are nice but there is no explanation of why they were chosen. <br /> <br />There is the usual Photo Gallery, Trailers and Teasers. None of which I watched. <br /> <br />The best is a documentary on the concept of the film with Martin Scorsese. <br />
0895260131|3.0|Robert Spencer's expos&eacute; of the violent and repressive Islamic societies resulting from a literalist reading of the Qur'an is correct as far as it goes.  The Qur'an is opaque enough, confusing enough and contradictory enough that just about any life philosophy can be validated by selecting and interpreting specific passages.<br /><br />The problem is, in Spencer's wildly one-sided polemic, Christianity does not come in for a similar criticism.  Just like Muslims there are Christians who pursue a fundamentalist, highly-repressive and freedom-hating agenda supported by selective reading of their Bible.  Just like Muslims there are Christians who would destroy art and culture in the pursuance of not offending their god.<br /><br />And just like Muslims the vast majority of Christian adherents favor a more enlightened interpretation of scripture.<br /><br />But Spencer has an agenda of his own, and that is to show that Islam is at its basis inherently evil and Christianity is inherently good.  In this he is, at best, only half right.<br /><br />Sam Harris pointed out in \\"The End of Faith\\" that moderate proponents of both apocalyptic cults have made it impossible to criticize the scriptural texts themselves.  This leaves fundamentalists adequate justification and authority for scriptural literalism, leading to a dangerous resurgence of Iron Age morality in the 21st Century.<br /><br />Refuting human progress is a problem for all three Abrahamic religions.
B00005JKED|5.0|I had not heard of Training Day until Denzel Washington won the best actor oscar for his role in the film.  This didn't make me want to watch it especially, as actors and actresses who usually win these awards tend to win them for roles in c**p arty films.  However a friend lent me the film when it came out on dvd and I was amazed, it is easily one of the best films I had seen in years.<br /><br />The star of the film is obviously Denzel Washington, who plays the corrupt, almost evil cop brilliantly.  Ethan Hawke also deserves a mention as the slightly naive rookie cop who disagrees with his partner's methods but reluctantly agrees to do most things he asks.  The film begins strangely with Alonzo (Denzel Washington) telling Jake Hoyt (Hawke) to smoke some weed they had picked up, and he also gives him alcohol after much pesuasion.  At first this seems strange but as the plot progresses it becomes evident Alonzo has Hoyt trapped.  The plot is superb, though the ending is a little predictable, not wanting to give it away though.  I also loved the cameo appearances from Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre, who was surprisingly good in his role.<br /><br />I won't mention any more of the plot, just to say if you haven't already seen this film, get it now.  A superb film and Denzel Washington definetely deserved his oscar and the other accolades that came his way.
B00000F566|5.0|I can't understand how some people are against Dirty Dancing or they didn't love that such great film. Patrick Swayze is so great and wonderful. He show us that he is the best dancer that we had ever seen in the world.His performance is extraordinary. He' so cute,sexy and sweet. All the actors played wonderfully but without Patrick Swayze it would have been impossible to make this great movie.The music and the landscapes,are so nice In my case it'a movie from my generation and each I see Dirty Dancing it remembers my youth. Don't miss this great movie!!
B00005JO1G|5.0|Even though Jarhead has a couple similarities to Full Metal Jacket, I would still consider this film to be one of the more orginial movies I've seen this year.  There are so many awesome truths about it all.  And it was an interesting paradox where Mendas shows the horrors of war and pokes fun at it all within the same film.  I loved the asethetic appeal, the acting, the directoring (Go American Beauty), and the themes.  It took me a couple of days to get over everything that is going on in Jarhead.  This is definetly worth putting in anybodys war movie collection.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is Madonna's newest release and might I add that the song selections are wonderful that after sampling from ITunes, I had to literally go out to the local Borders and get myself a copy! Not everyone will like the \\"feel\\" of the style of the music. Other reviewers have stated that they have an \\"80s\\" feel. I don't know what that means, but music is music and \\"Confessions on the Dance Floor\\" is music to this avid opera fan's ears.<br /><br />One tibit that annoys me about the album is that the album is meant to be played in 1-12 sequence because each songs ends and beings without any gaps.

B00005JNS0|5.0|Though Cars will not premiere in theatres till June 9th, 2006, I sincerely beleive it will become another PIXAR classic.<br /><br />In my past, I have considered every Teaser trailer of PIXAR's to give me the impression that the film would be disasterous.  From A Bug's Life to The Incredibles, the teasers usually left me groaining, thinking of inevitable disaster.  But every single time I saw the actual FILMS, I would be surprised, relieved, and overall GIDDY with happiness from the Quality of Work PIXAR puts into its films.<br /><br />SO when I saw the Cars Teaser in November before seeing The Incredibles, I actually was impressed and now wait dearly for the upcoming film, because when six films out of six films made from PIXAR are MEGA-BOX OFFICE HITS, as well as Oscar Winners . . . then its future films are bound to be great, if not PERFECT!<br /><br />I give this film 5 out of 5 for now . . . out of sheer precedence . . . but I doubt that I'll change it in the coming months!<br /><br />---<br /><br />And now it is August 2006, and I have seen Cars and given it a lot of thought.  While it may not be MY favorite PIXAR film to date, Cars remains an amazing film in all aspects, and it further shows how hard work & commitment really help in making a great film (Heck, it's the ONLY way!).<br /><br />This film prefectly captures the spirit of a road trip.  I may be off the edge here, but one of my favorite moments of the film was actually in the beginning, during the \\"Life is a Highway\\" Scene.  The very animation is stunning, and it throws me back in a time when I was but a wee child looking out my side window and seeing all those fields go by.  Honestly, I haven't been bored in a car since watching this movie.  That Road Trip vibe just keeps reappearing, even if I only travel to the supermarket!!<br /><br />One thing I do have to say, this DVD is NOT up to par.  Sure, the Movie is Awesome, and We'll get two shorts and the teaser to Ratatouille, but after that, it's just a few deleted scenes & ONE Featurette!!  This is seriously skimping out on the traditional PIXAR DVD, where two discs will give you tons of Bonus, too many to list (ALONGSIDE hundreds of little Easter Eggs).  Many of the PIXAR DVDs out even include BOTH formats.  Why this sudden change in tradtion?  Aside from a possible Disney-initiated \\"Double Dipping,\\" I really have no idea.  This is a great film, the DVD should be JUST as great.<br /><br />I'll still give this Film & DVD five stars.  But if a Two-Disc does not come out, then I'll be dissapionted indeed . . . .<br /><br />PS - GO SEE RATATOUILLE!!

B00005JO1J|3.0|I saw \\"Rent\\" on Broadway in 1999. I remember thinking, somewhere into the second act, I'm loving this but there isn't a whole lot going on. \\"Rent\\" survives, -flourishes, on it's sweeping strokes of humanity; on it's bohemian urban ragamuffins singing the praises of life while suffering poverty, disease and drug addiction, like poor and junkie graduates from the school of \\"Fame\\". Big empty spaces in the musical, like a few bland characterizations, and sometimes tuneless songs, were overlooked due to the genuine portrait of unfortunate, but very much alive, lives in New York City's gutter level Alphabet City.<br /><br />And for awhile it looked as though \\"Rent\\", the movie was going to accomplish the same fete. The first half moves at a lively pace, with beautiful people in ragged clothes, struggling for warmth in candlelit urban dwellings, songs pouring out of them as if it was a natural language, and colorful musical crowd scenes. The fiery and passive scene of a unified neighborhood, in chorus, taking a stand against slum lords, is a visual delight. Angel still makes her drop-dead sexy, snaky entrance, and I was about to be content to see \\"Rent\\" again realized, if not creatively reborn.<br /><br />But somewhere along the way, the urban twilight-y atomosphere loses its spark. The thin story lines, which once served quite adequately as brush stroke generalizations of the urban poor, take center stage in lieu of the hardcore song of the city, rising up from the very bricks and mortar of Alphabet City. I thought the film was hurt very much by the absence of the schizophrenic bag lady, so evident in the Broadway production, pushing her shopping cart on stage and joining in on the cast's songs. She served as an anchor weight inclusion of unfortunate city dwellers, not all of whom are artistic bohemians. Here, she has a single dramatic scene that segregates her, as if depicting the real urban poor.<br /><br />It was my understanding that Spike Lee was to be the director of the filmed, \\"Rent\\", and it would be interesting to see what another artist would have done. Director Chris Columbus extracts dynamic performances from the cast, notably Rosario Dawson, as a sympathetic and gorgeous heroin addicted AIDS victim, but he wastes precious time in many scenes, particularly the culture class gay wedding, that seems to wander in from a production of \\"Hair\\", and stays much too long.<br /><br />It's been six years since I saw \\"Rent\\" on Broadway, and I still get offers from that theatre for reduced price tickets to a second viewing. I enjoyed \\"Rent\\", the movie, but I may finally take the theatre up on its offer, now that I'm reminded of what a great show it was.rector of the filmed, \\"Rent\\", and it would be interesting to see what another artist would have done.

0783230079|5.0|It's the 1950s.  A man has a chance for a big audition, but is afraid to sing in front of a crowd.  Another man steals a valuable item from a 10 year-old boy, feels guilty, but is unable to return the item.  A low-income single mother puts her three children to bed, then hurries off to work the night shift.  Another woman has the opportunity to tell her boyfriend she loves him, but fails to take it.  Then POOF!  They're dead, and find themselves to be ghosts with unresolved issues in their lives.  Mysteriously, they find that their souls are forced to stay within about 10 feet of a baby named Thomas, and hang out with him as his \\"imaginary friends\\" until he's 8 years old, at which point they still hang out with him, but are invisible to him.  When Thomas is an adult, the four souls find they're supposed to have Thomas help them resolve the one major issue they wish they could have resolved before they died.  Not surprisingly, they reappear to him as an adult. <br /> <br />This is not only a great idea for a movie plot, it's well executed with excellent acting, good humor, and good cinematography.  The five major actors were all a pleasure to watch, in particular, Robert Downy Jr., as the grown up Thomas Reilly who did some amazing physical comedy.  The child actors were great at conveying emotion, particularly the boy who plays the school age Thomas Reilly, and Lavar David Levingston who plays the 4 year-old son of the single mother.  Most plot twists are predictable, but if you had as much fun as I did watching, you'll easily overlook that.   <br /> <br />If you had the good fortune to be alive at the end of the movie, you'll realize that you still have the chance to resolve the issues in your life, without waiting until you're a ghost and having to cajole a living person to do it for you.  The movie tells us in a humorous way, not to miss our opportunity!     <br />
B000BYY0RY|5.0|I flew to Paris back in March specifically to see Kylie perform at Le Zenith. I knew that she would never tour the USA and because this tour was considered \\"The Greatest Hits Tour\\", I knew I had to see it. <br /> <br />Kylie's concert was phenomenal. From the moment she took the stage with \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" (my favorite Kylie song of all time) and walked off the stage with \\"Love At First Sight\\", I was captivated. She looked better than ever in all her costumes and I was mesmerized by her vocal abilities. When she sang \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\", I shed a tear.  <br /> <br />I have all of her previous concerts on DVD, but it was exciting to hear all my favorite songs performed live for the first time. Believe it or not, I've been a fan since she first hit the music scene in 1987 with \\"Locomotion\\" and have followed her career throughout the years, buying all her CDs as imports. <br /> <br />Kylie Minogue is one performer who only keeps getting better with time! If you are a fan of Kylie or have never experienced her live, then this is a must-have DVD for your collection. Take it from a fan of almost 20 years, you will not be disappointed.
1559408855|2.0|I find this movie to be extremely underwhelming. After having read these exaggerating reviews, I had taken the plunge and decided to purchase this film; what a mistake. This movie is not revolting, nor is it deprave, perverse, or atrocious. Nothing portrayed in this film excited my senses to react in any certain way: in fact it was only merely a backround image to which I paid little to no attention to. That is not to say I found it disgusting to watch, no. I found it to be boring and derived my attention from things I had at hand. I know it would be near impossible to put to film every atrocity cited in de Sade's book, but I would have at least liked to have seen more of the crimes acted out than hearing more narrative than action. If you are interested in looking into this film, feel free. Tastes vary, and I am not saying mine is any better than anothers' -- though it is common nature to think thyself is higher than another in terms of opinions and taste -- but curiousity will lead some to view. If you so wish to expose your eyes to this dissapointment put to film, then be my guest. I would rather advise those strongly seeking, to end their quest.
B000BO0LKY|1.0|OK, I understand. Mariah has had 16 #1s in the US - Madonna has had 12, yadda, yadda, yadda...  <br /> <br />Mariah has had two UK #1s and Madonna has had 11. That's just two countries. See, it's proof Madonna is the Ultimate Pop Queen and that worldwide, people enjoy Madonna's music more.  <br /> <br />This release is also a cash-in.
B000002UDD|5.0|Classic metal. Yes I know there's a lot of reverb. Though I wouldn't want every cd that way, I think it sounds good on this one. This record came out in the winter and the reverb really goes well with the snow and cold! I'll take this anyday over the remaster.

B0000067L2|4.0|1967. The days of psychadelia. Back in the day where EVERYBODY had a psychadelic record out (Even the Stones, unfortunately). Cream came out with theirs, and I must say it's pretty good--for the most part.<br /><br />Strange Brew...whoa. Great track, great harmonies, great guitar...yeah. Sunshine of Your Love...classic stuff. Jack Bruce and Eric Clapton duel on the vocals, and of course there's that riff, up there with riffs of Jumpin' Jack Flash and Stairway to Heaven in terms of recognizability. Things slow down a bit with the strange psychadelia World of Pain, then pick up with Dance the Night Away, a real drugged-out tune, but in a good way. Let us not speak of Ginger Baker's worthless, annoying Blue Condition, which is close to unlistenable.<br /><br />Next up, another one-two punch: Tales of Brave Ulysses and SWLABR (She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow...yeah). The former a psychadelic mythological track that predates Zeppelin by a decade, the latter a psychadelic hard rocker about (probably) drugs. Both great tunes! We're Going Wrong is also good, but not as good as the previous tunes.<br /><br />Sadly, it's all downhill from here. They could've picked a lot better of a blues tune than Outside Woman Blues to cover. As for Take It Back, all I have to say is, \\"Get that thing right out of here!\\" Lastly, there's one of the dumbest songs Cream ever recorded; Mother's Lament. This has got to be a joke!<br /><br />Oh well.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am not here to review this album, as I've done that before on many other accounts. (Shhh, don't tell any Mariah fans.) I can't stand it when people say Mariah has had more #1 singles than Madonna, because, truth is, she hasn't! Sure she has in the US, but not worldwide. Let's take a look then...     Madonna has had 11 UK #1s (one recently scored with Hung Up, which has spent two weeks at #1, and is set to spend a third week at #1 there, as is this album, with a second week), whereas Mariah has only had two #1s. Don't forget, Mariah's two UK #1s are Without You and Against All Odds - they are both cover versions and Mariah never co-wrote them. (No affence to Westlife, because they are brilliant guys. They worked with Mariah on the UK version of the song.) Madonna co-wrote most, if not all, of her 11 UK #1s. Futhermore, Mariah's had a bunch of 16 #1s in the US, whereas Madonna's had 12, though Hung Up is heading for #1...     Total? With the US and the UK, Mariah's had 18 #1s, and Madonna's had 23. And that's just two countries, remember...    Madonna is also a better seller, and speaking of which, Confessions has already surpassed four million copies worldwide (3.5 sold in its first week). I don't think Mariah's sold that much in its first week, and as it stands, Madonna's new album is an absolute stomper. They are all great tracks. And that's my review.
B0000C8AVE|4.0|Bob's second album, and a pretty good one I must say! Five classics are available on this disc: Blowin' in the Wind, Girl from the North Country, Masters of War, A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall and Don't Think Twice It's All Right. And these are among the best in Bob's catalouge Three of these five are protest songs, in fact about half the album is made up of those; some are bleak (Masters of War, Hard Rain, Oxford Town), others a bit more lighthearted and goofy (Talkin' World War III Blues) and still others sad and melancholy in tone (Classic Blowin' in the Wind). But there are also a couple good romantic tunes here, in the form of Girl of the North Country and Don't Think Twice, It's a ll Right, which I believe to be the best song on the album. Then there's I Shall Be Free, which I guess could be considered a protest, but it's a funny one! Bob takes the role of a guy who is apparently well-connected (he's friends with John F. Kennedy) and popular (he mentions several women). However, the song is a bit dated-having not grown up in the 60's, I have never heard of half the people he's mentioned-which is part of the reason why it's not as good as the other songs.<br /><br />However, there are three tunes here I out-and-out don't like. The first is Down the Highway - the song drags on forever, even though it's not really all that long, and isn't very creative. Next is Bob Dylan's Dream, where Bob attempts philosophy and comes up miserabley, intolerabley short. Finally, the sole cover-Corrina Corrina-simply isn't Bob's type of song.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|So! Good! <br />Even if you didn't catch Firefly on TV, you'll love this movie, and maybe even discover the terrific show it was based on in the series DVD set. It's awesome!
B000002H6C|5.0|Wow. When you just thought things couldnt get any better after ALL TIME classics such as \\"Kill em all\\", \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride the lightning\\", Metallica come out with \\"..And justice for all\\". <br />Just put the CD in, crank up the volume and let the ripping riffs run loose. <br /> <br />Grade - A+ <br />Favorite track - \\"One\\" (One of the greatest songs of ALL time. PERIOD)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You can read all about this show in the other comments, so all I want to add is that I fell in love with Firefly. We all have heard that it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. To this we could add that you shouldn't be so afraid of losing something that you won't try for it.  <br /> <br />Don't miss Firefly. This was something really special.
B000002H2H|5.0|For me, this is the second greatest thrash metal album of all time(ranking just below one of Metallica's other classics \\"Master of Puppets\\") <br /> <br />RIP Cliff Burton (The greatest bass player of ALL TIME) <br /> <br />Grade - A+ <br />Favorite track - For whom the bell tolls

B00007FOMP|5.0|Although Motown founder Barry Gordy had originally refused to release it because he had predicted it would be a commercial flop, Gaye pushed and pushed until Gordy finally relented.  The result was an enormous commercial success, and a gift to succeeding generations.  The tracks on this album are not only timely, addressing the social problems of Gaye's generation, but also timeless in a way that few songs in history have been.    From the titular track to Inner City Blues, Gaye's inspirational talent shines through.  An uplifting tribute to peace, love, and happiness, \\"What's Going On\\" is sure to evoke long-hidden memories from those who were around during the chaotic Vietnam years, just as surely it will delight and inspire the first-time listener.    This is a must-have for any collection.
1401301010|5.0|This is one of the best and most candid autobiographies I have ever read. Anthony is very open and honest about his ups and downs from childhood to his current life from his super band RHCP. If you like books about rock n roll life you will enjoy it. If you are a RHCP fan this book is a MUST read.
B000089CJI|5.0|This is one great cd.  I have had it for about a year, I think.  Some of my favorite songs are on this album.  I especially like \\"Such Great Heights.\\"  Nearly all of the songs on this cd are great to hear over and over again.  I am looking forward to seeing the next Postal Service cd come out.
B0002EXH40|5.0|From the heavy opener to the humorous closing, this is a very strong CD with no weak tracks that even makes a slight improvement over Megadeth's previous entry, Countdown To Extinction. Those who already have the original album don't necessarily need to rush to re-buy this entry (it already sounded great, so not much improvement was made in the sound quality, and the bonus tracks are nothing to write home about), but if you don't have this already, you must run out and buy this NOW.
0307276902|3.0|This novel is written in a disjointed ee cummings-esque style - random capitalization of words provide emphasis, uneven punctuation makes for a poem-like read. Once you get used to Frey's style though, the book is one you won't be able to put down. Frey's imagery is graphic and real - this book is not for the faint at heart. If you can handle the blood & guts though, you will be rewarded with a captivating, real-life journey the author took to recovery. His friends were not so lucky. The one thing that bothered me about the book was the statement Frey made regarding 12 step programs. While I am not an addict, I know many people who are friends of Bill and the 12 steps truly saved their lives. That the author escaped certain death from his addictions through will alone is hard to believe. I'm glad for him, but his denunciation of the 12 steps is somewhat irresponsible given the wide reach of his audience. Just one woman's opinion.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|Man, do I love this CD. I simply don't understand why so many people don't like it. The cover is one of my favorite album covers of all time (just like KIMB remastered), and every track is simply righteous. Defining 80's thrash. The MUCH-improved sound quality is worth the price of this remaster alone, and the extra tracks are an interesting listen. One of the best has just gotten better.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Like Alanis Morisette? Then you'll like Avril Lavigne. She's a Alanis wannabe(which theres nothing wrong with). But unlike Alanis she gets very annoying after you've had her Cd for awhile and hear My Happy Ending frequently on the radio and the lyrics are in peoples profiles for AIM. Now that Avril's Cd has been out for a while and the songs are played rarely i can finally start listening to her Cd again.  <br /> <br />Now, comparing to her old Cd, she's totally different. Her  <br />songs have matured and her songs are a lot more Rock than rock pop. So if you think you can handle all the things i've said then buy this Cd, but if you can not then leave it alone.  <br />
B0002EXH5O|5.0|A thrash masterpiece. After the excellent (in my opinion) SFSGSW, Dave was arrested for (ironicaly, at the time) driving under the influence, went to rehab, and came out sober. Didn't stop him from putting out one of the metal world's strongest albums, though. <br /> <br />The fact that Dave redid the vocals on many of the tracks doesn't bother me a bit; still sounds great to me. This is also the only remastered 'Deth CD that has worthwhile extra tracks - Chris Poland demos! <br /> <br />It doesn't matter if you grew up with an old cassette of this or you are just getting into Megadeth, buy this now, it's actually the best place to start.
B00062J00S|5.0|I have to make an admission that I'm not exactly proud of.  Despite numerous opportunities to see this film over the years outside of a few snippets I casually watched this is the first time I've seen \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" in it's entirety.  I had no conscious resistance to the film.  When it was in the public domain it seemed like it was on TV every night on every channel so my thought was I'll catch it some other time.  Some other time finally came and, boy, was I wrong not to catch this cinematic treasure earlier.  This is not just a celebration of Christmas but a celebration of American idealism.  Bedford Falls, a microcosm of middle America, epitomizes the sense of community that we may not achieve but at least aspire to.  George Bailey(James Stewart) is our everyman who perserveres  despite the disappointments life throws at him.  Behind every good man there is a good woman and his wife Mary(Donna Reed) encapsulates that.  The film's basic premise is that every person has an impact on their community, for better or for worse, and despite the curveballs thrown our way life is worth living.  In lesser hands this theme could have been greeting card hokum but in director Frank Capra's hands it is life affirming.
B0002EXH54|5.0|As awesome as Killing Is My Business was, it didn't grab nearly as much attention as Megadeth's sophomore album did. Every track is just genre-defining except for I Ain't Superstitious, a below-average, clear-cut filler. The other 7 tracks are still very righteous though, and the extra tracks, while not worth the price of re-admission (the improved sound quality is, though), is an interesting take on these classics. Worth it for any metal fan.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|This is the dark Batman that Frank Miller created, mixed with some of the original 1940's iconography from the Batman's original Comic Book beginnings.  At certain  points during this caper it was a little bit difficult to recognize him as a hero who wants to help the downtrodden, because of his dark nature (played to the hilt by Christian Bale - the American Psycho himself). <br />Michael Caine has a wonderful comedic influence on this semi-twisted movie.  More power to this actor!  It is certainly a long way from The Hand. <br />Katie Holmes seems to be a bit young for the Bat to be dating, but he is a millionaire.  I suppose that the characters were supposed to be approximately the same age from the scene towards the beginning of the movie where they were playing in the Wayne garden and Bruce discovers the cave under the South-West corner of the Manse. <br />The new Bat-Moblie is killer.  I like the jet-powered one from the Burton films better, but this one served its' purpose.  I never visualized the Bat driving what is, for all intents, a Tank!  It works. <br />This film is a new conceptualization of Gotham and its residents. <br />The character of Jonathan Crane was well played.  I cannot remember the actor who brought him to life on tis movie, but he made the Scarecrow real for me. <br />I highly recommend this movie!
B00005V0X5|5.0|Megadeth's debut was, undoubtedly, their rawest-sounding, most intense, fastest,  angriest, and overall, thrashiest album they've ever released. No point in going through all the tracks; they all pretty much own. And These Boots was never a 'Deth song I cared much for until now, in it's hilariously edited form (though many fans despise it this way). If you haven't yet, grab this remastered KIMB, or get both if you want These Boots too.
0743243153|5.0|I read this book when I was 19 and it really opened my eyes and mind. I would recommend this to anyone who seeks some encouragement on their pathway to never ending spiritual and personal growth.  <br /> <br />'Life is difficult' as the first line says. Their are no shortcuts to achieving wholeness and true happiness in life. One must work through difficulties. The principles in this book are essential, I believe, for mental and emotional health.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|After nearly 4 years since their last official studio effort (not counting 2003's \\"Steal This Album!\\") System Of A Down boldly returned in May with their newest offering \\"Mezmerize\\". \\"Mezmerize\\" proved to be well worth the wait, and when I heard that it would be the first part of a double album, the second part being released 6 months after, I was very excited. But after the excellent return with \\"Mexmerize\\", where did that leave SOAD to go? \\"Hynotize\\" clearly answers that question by being one of the best and most refreshing rock/metal albums of the year. Everything you've ever loved about SOAD is fully intact on the release, and in fact is much better than it has ever been. \\"Hypnotize\\" is everything its predessecor \\"Mezmorize\\" was and more, making it a must hear for all fans. <br /> <br />Opening up with the blistering anthem \\"Attack\\", System of A Down ups the ante on all levels. \\"Attack\\" features amazingly well written lyrics about our government and its nact for attacking things that don't necessarily need attacked, however it's not just the typical \\"no war in Iraq\\" song. No SOAD relates how our own government could eventually turn around and just attack us all, because they could. The excellent lyrics of Serj and Daron's lyrics are just as impressive as always on the release, something which I have always loved about the band. Songs like \\"Kill Rock And Roll\\" and \\"Hypnotize\\" are fairly different from anything the band has written before, and pieces like \\"Stealing Society\\" and \\"U-Fig\\" recall their roots from their Self-Titled album. Musically the band is on the same level as \\"Mezmerize\\", which is not a bad thing at all. Daron gives a great performance on guitar, throwing out thrash inspired riffs in heavier tunes like the afformentioned \\"Stealing Society\\" and \\"Attack\\", but is also capable of laying down soft and intricate portions on thought provokers like \\"Lonely Day\\" and \\"Soldier Side\\". If you listened to \\"Mezmerize\\" you probably noticed Daron's increased timeon the mic, which is carried over into this album as well. His vocals aren't bad by any means, but Serj Tankian has always been the reason why SOAD had such a unique sound, and really I'd like to hear Serj more than Daron. As for Serj's vocals, there are great like always, showing his usual range of zany stylings evident through out all the top tracks like \\"Attack\\", \\"Kill Rock And Roll\\" and \\"Stealing Society\\". Shavo Odajian and John Dolmayan back the band in stellar fashion once again and propel the heavier the songs, and well as balance the slower ones. The album moves at a great pace, and is 12 actual songs (\\"Mezmerize\\" was 10 songs and an intro) so you have plenty to choose from. Standouts include \\"Attack\\", \\"Kill Rock And Roll\\" and \\"Stealing Society\\". <br /> <br />In the end \\"Hypnotize\\" is everything I hoped it would be and more. This clearly surpasses the precedent set by \\"Mezmerize\\", and is one of the best albums you're likely to hear this year. In typical fashion there is a nice variety of SOAD tunes found on this record, and all fans of the band are going to find something about this cd to enjoy. The cover art is particularly cool, and the way it fits with the cover of \\"Mezmerize\\" is very well done. Like \\"Mezmerize\\" before it, it's nice to hear a great band like System Of A Down returning to top form in a time where the original movement they were a part of has slowly died away. This proves that the band was not just a product of their time, but a band with the power to stay years after they debuted. \\"Hypnotize\\" is a testament to that. Having the heavy, catchy tunes that initially drew us to the band, slow and introspective pieces that give the album depth, and plenty of craziness and politically charged lyrics to satisfy the most hardcore fans, \\"Hypnotize\\" is flat out a must hear release this year. Don't delay.
B00005JMEW|5.0|In KB1, we touch bases on a lot of things and a lot of heads are rolling ( and other body parts)! Uma surely outdid herself  in this movie all the way! The crazy 88 killing action sequence totally owns while the duel between The Bride and O- Ren ends the movie perfectly and on a great note! Not to mention the Hattori Hanzo swords were awesome. Now, I'm going to have to get me one!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|She was lucky to sell so much of this trashy album originally, but now she is just pushing it. She is milking the cow with this release, and us fans should not put up with it. Slap Mimi up, and throw her with yesterdays trash i say!!! She is a vile, fat and over-grown monster who needs to be stopped. All her albums are contrived crap, and they all sound like they are created by some computer.  <br /> <br />MAriah, please lose some weight before you decide to wear a skimpy dress again, and save us all the agony of having to look at your vile body!!! Lay of the krispy kremes mimi!!!
B00005JO1P|5.0|Walk The Line is definitly my favorite movie of the year.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are absolutly amazing as Johnny Cash and June Carter.  Their voices amazed me because before the movie, both of them couldn't sing a note!  I hope it gets a whole lot of Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Actress.  I'd love to see this again in theaters.  I simply can't wait to purchase this awesome movie when it comes out on DVD.  SEE THIS AWESOME MOVIE!  I promise, you will be taken back by the outstanding acting and the awesome music of Johnny Cash.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I actually started watching this film reluctantly which my roommate rented to watch on his own time. I've heard of Phantom of the Opera and was a little familiar with the music but curiosity got me watching the film and it's actually a very good movie with catchy music.  If the theater production is anywhere near the creativity and story of the movie, I'll have to go watch it in theater.
B000062TU1|5.0|Not being a Potterphile, and never having read the books, I approached the film version of this installment purely on its cinematic value.  And the filmmakers have created a wonderfully imaginative vision of the world of magic and sorcery.  Director Chris Columbus heads the technical crew with amazing special effects, wonderful costumes and scenery and a rousing score by the inimitable John Williams.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are a captivating trio of child actors, and the supporting cast is superb:  Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, the late Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Julie Walters, etc.  While the movie is longish, over two and a half hours, you never lose your interest and it is overall a \\"classic\\" style of film that should appeal to even those of us who aren't on the Harry Potter bandwagon.  As a movie, it's marvelous.
B00008H2LB|1.0|The band Linkin Park is a joke, I must say I agree with the rest of the one star reveiws. Anyone who rates this 4 or 5 stars doesn't know what they're talking about and doesn't know anything about true musicianship. This band is pathetic. I do own this album, so I've heard the songs, but I haven't even listened to it in years because it's gotten so old and played out, so I might as well just throw it away. For one thing, the drummer completely sucks. Alot of times you wonder if it's a human playing the drums or a keyboard/computer playing a drum beat. The drum beats are so simple that a 5 year old could probably play them. The guitarist just plays like 3 of the exact same chords in each song. He doesn't even know how to solo. Each song sounds the same because they always use the same chord structure and pattern all the time. There is not a single sound of bass at all in the album. What is he not playing or does he not have is amp turned up I mean what's the problem. Another problem, this is supposed to be a rock album, not electronica or techno. There are waayyy too many DJ turntable scratches, too many synths, and too many overproccessed sounds, synths, and keyboards. If you want to hear heavy metal with keyboards done right then listen to Rammstein. Linkin Park is just all wrong. There's no true musicanship in this band whatsoever. The lyrics? Just the same old \\"boo hoo my life sucks\\" message in ALL of the songs. So pathetic. The singer Chester tries so hard to be such an intimidating hardass in all of the songs but instead comes off as a angry 3 year old whose mad becuase he can't get his way. The dude has some seroius growing up to do before he can be taken seroiusly by ANYONE whose not 10-14 years old. And another thing I've also heard of mothers liking this band. If your mom can listen to the same bands as you can without a problem, then that's proof right there that it's not real metal. This band has alot of work to do with their music, first off, the drummer and guitarist should actually sit down and study and pracitce their instruments instead of just playing their instruments for the first time without any real practice or musical knowledge behind it. These guys are no different from the rest of the whiny emo pop/rock scene bands out there like My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy. It's so sickening. The band Linkin Park probably one of the most popular bands out there among teenagers and they're probably living in mansions so what do they have to be so mad about? I mean grow up. Here's a list of bands you SHOULD be listening to: Children Of Bodom, Burnt By The Sun, As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, Trivium, The Chariot, Mortal Treason, Converge, The Red Chord, Necrophagist, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Psyopus. Avoid Linkin Park. They're just another band doing it only for the money.and guitarist should actually sit down and study and pracitce their instruments instead of just playing their instruments for the first time without any real practice or musical knowledge behind it.

Here's a list of bands you SHOULD be listening to: Children Of Bodom, Burnt By The Sun, As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage, Lamb of God, Trivium, The Chariot, Mortal Treason, Converge, The Red Chord, Necrophagist, The Dillinger Escape Plan, and Psyopus. Avoid Linkin Park. They're just another band doing it only for the money.
0792164903|5.0|My daughter and I loved watching Sleepy Hollow, and not just because Johnny Depp is in the starring role! The film has a wonderful eerie quality but also combines CSI with a great supernatural mystery. My daughter says its one of the coolest movies she has ever seen.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|The only thing which is ultra-platinum about this relese is Mimi's back side, as she is one bloated mamma. Seriously, stop buying her records and supporting her eating habits. It is disgraceful!!! <br /> <br />Madonna is skinny, beautiful and talented. She doesn't need implants to sell albums. Mariah, put that cake down now!!!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I was at the '94 concert in Rotterdam, Netherlands and later saw the Earls court concert on BBC, which I luckely recorded on a VHS cassette. So, I know what I'm going to get, and probably more with this official release. <br />This concert sets the standard for sound and visual effects. I cannot foresee or imagine a live concert in the years to come who will match the PULSE concerts. Anyone appreciating PF will have chills from beginning to the end from this dvd. David Gilmours singing skills are ok but not outstanding. But, his guitar skills on PULSE are incredible. The visual effects on Comfortable Numb are superb. Beleave me, you will get tears in your eyes after the 5 minute guitar solo from David Gilmour and the effects created with the movable round projection screen. <br />So, for PF fans, this will be the best buy ever.
B00005JLKB|5.0|As a diehard SUPERMAN fan, over 40, I was a skeptic but I can't say enough good things about this fantastic show for viewers of all ages and tastes!  It is all produced with appropriate respect for the legend of the infamous icon, but with contemporary savvy and excellent production values.  It is a combination of X FILES, NIGHT GALLERY, TWILIGHT ZONE and SUPERMAN (okay with maybe a little ONE TREE HILL thrown in for the puberty-set).<br /><br />Seeing the entire first season in one collection makes you appreciate the labour of love even more.  The casting, writing, production design, etc...all come together perfectly.  Only the supporting cast of dayplayers and smaller guest stars (presumeably hired on location) are the weak links.<br /><br />Definitely one to own and enjoy!  Scary (PG-13), creepy, exciting, sappy, you name it...it's drive-in theatre or matinee movie time!  Translates much better onto DVD than in random prime-time viewing.  Cool soundtrack, too!
B000B8QF00|4.0|Overall this is a good collection, but I was disappointed to see \\"Precious Illusions\\" and \\"So Pure\\", two of my favorite Alanis songs, not included on this collection.  Those are two great songs and should be here.  Instead, Alanis has put on some rarities - which is not a bad thing - but I would have liked to have seen those two songs, as well as some other songs including \\"Joining You\\". <br /> <br />Having said that, Alanis has put out some great singles in the past ten years, and this collection showcases her talents.  I particularly enjoy her new version of Seal's \\"Crazy\\".  It's dance-oriented, and dance music suits Alanis very well. I hope she does more dance songs.   <br /> <br />
B000B8QEYC|2.0|enya is like the Sade of New age Music in that nobody  can lay claim to the way they put stylings down&are able to build catelogs of material.a Proven formula that has worked. Enya's latest Amarantine sounds like leftovers from the past  albums that didn't quite make the cut. very average at best.I ain't felt a Enya album in years,but like How Sade is able to maintain what she has done over the past couple of decades Enya has been able to do her thing,but this album shows a artist running short on new ideas but safe on formula.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I'm in love with this girl (I used to be in love with Agnetha - the blonde with ABBA). Sure the sounds are familiar. That's what makes us want her songs. I can't imagine her doing \\"Hip Hop\\"  or \\"Rap\\" just to give us variety. Ever listen to Neil Diamond? I can tell it's a Neil Diamond record even if I can't hear the words. The style is what seperates the artist.<br /><br />This albums mix is balanced and very enjoyable. I own a retail store and play Amarantine over our sound system and it never fails that a customer will ask \\"What is that song? - \\"it's beautiful\\". I don't sell it but I'll bet the Border's next door gets a lot of sales from my customers.<br /><br />If you enjoy Enya, the album is worth every penny.  Enya's certainly passed the test of time and her sales of millions and millions of albums speak for themselves.<br /><br />On the negative side - I think the album cover could have been better designed and photographed.<br /><br />If you like Enya - buy this album.<br /><br />PS - I love that bell!
B000BO0LLS|2.0|this ain't no bargin by releasing a Album that has enjoyed alot of success with tossing on 2-3 new songs&then re-selling as a Whole again. let it be called a Classic before doing this thing.Usher,Jay z&some other acts have pulled this stunt in the very recent&I ain't ever liked it.I say wait about 3-5 years at least before re-releasing something with bonus tracks&whatnot.Michael Jackson had the re-release of Off the wall,thriller&bad&those were worth getting because enough time had passed&also you gain a whole good perspective on classic Albums. nowadays if a Album sells 3 million copies then it might automatically get this kind of treatment.now I will say mariah Carey along with Green Day have been the comeback kids of this past year.Mariah's Album I find just slightly better than average,but there is no denying Her singles run of the past year.but the cuts that didn't make the album the first go around sound just like 2nd rate cuts at best.if you are gonna re-release a Project then have a whole Bonus disc of 15 cuts that didn't make the cut. make a whole new set of tracks. 2-3 cuts belong as B-Sides to A Side singles released.that is why the single is a Lost tool at the record shop.of course Mariah carey has had singles floating here&there,but I would like to hear at least 12-15 cuts that didn't make the cut.that would be a Novel concept.
0141301066|4.0|This book is about genius girl, who named Matilda. She is only four years old, but she can read books. And also, she already knew two-times table before she went to school. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood, were really mean to Matilda. When she was five years and half, she started to go to primary school. Her teacher, Miss. Honey, is kindhearted teacher. But her school's headmistress, Miss. Trunchbull, is mean person. She hates little children.  <br />Matilda always made me feel exciting. Especially when she gave tit for tat to her parents and Miss. Trunchbull. And Miss. Honey made me feel worm when she was helping Matilda from Miss. Truchbull's mean behavior. And I like Matilda and Miss. Honey's kindhearted mind. Even Matilda is genius, everyone never be jealous. I think every classmates like Matilda's kindness mind.  <br />I like this book. Actually I don't really like reading books. But this book, Matilda, never make me feel boring. This book is one of my favorite book. When I started to read this book, I couldn't stop reading it. I could see that Roald Dahl was telling everyone not to be mean adult like Miss. Trunchbull. The person who like reading novel, may like this book, Matilda.  Someday, I will try other book written by Roald Dahl. <br />

B000BJS4SU|3.0|dug the Blue Note records looking cover. John Mayer is a talented Guitar Player who works quite well with Pino Palladino&Steve Jordan. the only thing missing here is that while Polished&well played,John Mayer ain't ready to get where he is attempting to get to.He seems like He is trying to hard to Impress or be beyond where he has at now.nothing wrong with taken a Artistic risk,but while John Mayer is well suited for the James Taylor vibe he ain't quite fully ready to tackle the stevie Ray Vaughan side of town. but nevertheless I enjoy the musicianship&this is a Pretty good album adding all things up.I'd give this album a 2&half to a 3  to round things up.
6305280762|4.0|You know, it's amazing how one can judge a movie like \\"The Towering Inferno\\" without reminiscing your childhood -I was eight years old when I first saw it and it gave the creeps because of the explosions, the victims, the resolution, and being introduced to Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, a couple of great actors who have been rumored to be like oil and water in real life even though they showed a great chemistry as heroes in this movie.<br /><br />Now I still like this movie, but I'm seeing it with different eyes.  In my opinion, the diffenrent stories in the film are somehow cheesy, especially the relationship between Lisolette (Jennifer Jones) and Harlee (Fred Astaire), as well as Susan (Faye Dunaway) and Doug (Newman).  The situations that lead to the inferno are unbelievable in a way, not forgetting the water tanks explosions as the resolution of the movie.  However this Irwin Allen \\"classic\\" still keeps me watching it as many times as I possibly can.  Ah, those disaster flicks of the 70s...It's difficult to forget them, especially this one, believe me.
B000AGTPUA|3.0|Jameson Thottam checking out Polar Express <br /> <br />The Basics from Jameson Thottam <br />Polar Express goes 3/4 of the way in every department, the story, the script, the voice/acting. If you've ever ridden the subway and had to quit ten stops before your destination, you'll realize the degree of annoyance and letdown involved. Tom Hanks voices 6 characters in this movie version of the justly celebrated children's book of the same name. Four of them are worth keeping, providing for some adjustments. Santa himself is not one of them.  <br /> <br />Review of the Child Characters: Jameson Thottam <br />Of the three child characters, I'd say about 1/3 of each characterization is dated and worn out--even vaguely token and perhaps insulting. I'll leave that for Jesse Helms and Jesse Jackson to fight it out. From starting gate to the 100 minute mark this train steams forward in full action/adventure mode. But even here, warning signs begin first to tink, then to sound, then to BLAIR LOUDLY.  <br /> <br />Jameson Luke Thottam: Story Line <br />Our story begins with Hero Boy doubting the existence of Santa Claus, the veracity of the North Pole mythos, and well on the path toward discovering the elves' origins in Norse/Icelandic pagan god mythos. As he was on his way toward discovering new and intriguing things about the cultures of the planet on which he lived, he must be stopped immediately. And so on Christmas Eve, what arrives at the scheduled hour of dreamtime but the Polar Express to take him on the path to North Pole enlightenment.  <br /> <br />Jameson L Thottam: Multiple Adventures <br />From there to the North Pole many adventures unveil, but a sense of repetition creeps in after, say, the fifth jittery roller coaster downhill slope on a runaway train. I loved the sequence involving the lost ticket which tips its hat in the most unlikely direction of Winged Migration in terms of \\"how the hell did they get that shot?\\" The first roller-coaster type action scene with Hero Boy trying to retrieve the ticket -- great, but very similar sequences just grind the adrenaline down.  <br /> <br />Jameson Thottam: Summary <br />I disliked every single minute of the last twenty which are all bromides like \\"keep the spirit of Christmas in your heart.\\" The entire last 2/3 of the North pole scenes almost destroyed the good will built up in the previous 95 minutes -- and it's really not as if the first third of that portion were really inventive or new like parts of the first portion of the film. The North Pole gift terminal scenes, while enjoyable, have a vague air of TOY STORY TOY STORY TOY STORY TOY STORY TOY STORY familiarity to them. Visually and cinematically ranging from good to sporadically amazing in it's first two thirds, the last third settles for just plain lazy, and that is not a gift I'd want to give for Christmas.  <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Love the album, love her, hate the self-doubt.  Now that I have played the album to death, I begin to pay attention to the lyrics.  Madonna, once again, has a song on her album that wonders whether she should be rich and famous and is it still worth it (or was it worth it).  DRIVES ME CRAZY!  Okay, so maybe she has some regrets?  If so, do something other than write songs about it.  Some of us love her because of who she was and who she is now and enjoy watching her evolve.  Evolving is one thing--self doubt without action (writing songs doesn't count--it is the first step perhaps, but you can only do step one so many times) is truly maddening.
B0000VD04M|5.0|When Hollywood opts to make a movie about your life, man you have arrived, at least in that zip code you have..That's just how it is!..Fame is its own metric..Understand, the odds of getting any movie on any given subject green-lighted, is about as likely as winning a 5 state powerball lottery!..So, despite Ed Wood's well publicised reputation as the very worst film-maker in the no-talent B movie genre, but more specifically, in overall Hollywood film history, some studio executive decided portions of Ed's life were worth reexamination..The moral, if you're going to live, by all means live extravagantly!..What was it then about Ed Wood that set him apart from the laundry list of long forgotten low-brow film makers?..Is it even a worthwhile discussion, a fluke, or just more schmaltz?..And why would a talent like Tim Burton, who after all launched the first \\"Batman\\", an enormous big budget extravaganza want to take \\"Ed Wood\\" the project, on?..Ed Wood, the film-maker, writer, producer, financier? was the irrepressible everyman, that didn't/couldn't fathom personal failure, like he'd had a sensitivity bypass at birth..Didn't understand he had no right to approach a giant, a legend, like Bela Lugosi, and see if he would star in the movie of a producer not only not well known, not well funded, but worse, not welcome!..Despite, Bela had been long forgotten and written off as an incorrigible junkie, which he was, by that same film colony that once embraced his talent, that single-handedly toted the note for a select studio in town, for years..The story of \\"Ed Wood\\" is the story of Hollywood, itself..A town built on impossible dreams by impossible dreamers..And Ed Wood's gift in the end was either his fearlessness or his abject ignorance..Sounds like the bio of Jon Peters to me!..The most endearing quality about Ed Wood's was his naivete and his super saleamanship skills, because he was obviously totally bereft of talent or taste..He saw himself as a film-maker and evidentlythat was what he declared himself to be!..And the only explicable reason he is remembered today, and remains a certifiable Hollywood icon!..Johhny Depp brought Ed Wood to life, and credit to Johnny for seeing the infinite possibilties in the script, and Ed's character..I saw \\"Ed Wood\\" with enormous trepidation, how could this movie/concept be of interest, or have a scintilla of entertainment value?..And within minutes was shocked by the genuis of the idea, cast, and crew, and depth of the story..The most redeeming feature of the movie was Johnny Depp's absolute sincerity and respect for his character and for the character of Bela Lugosi..I revist \\"Ed Wood\\" every chance I get, and thought parts of \\"Bowfinger\\", were in many respects a reincarnation of \\"Ed Wood\\", and as equally as charming..See \\"Ed Wood\\" soon..You will be reminded that movies are ultimately about people and their stories, not just special effects, though that was above all else, Ed Wood's preferred domain!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Don't Listen to the 1 star reviews they just hate Madonna and have not heard the album at all you can tell from their reviews. Nothing about the album but the artist Madonna. Now for a review of each song.      Hung Up: Great song which samples Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man after Midnight the 1979 hit my ABBA. There is one part in this song where it slows down and you can hear 80's sound more pronounced and you hear a clock ticking then going off with another alarm clock going off at the same time, very clever. It smoothly moves into the next song.    Get Together: The beginning sounds like Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper. She sings \\"Can we get together I really want to be with you\\" The songs gets a little fast toward the middle with again amazing 80's sounds blended in while she is singing. It ends the same way it beginns.     Sorry: She says Sorry in 5 different languages and you  hear in the background \\"I heard it all before\\" repeated numerous times with each time it gets louder and she sings \\"I don't want to hear, I dont want to know, please dont say your sorry\\". She also sings \\"don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap\\" great words. Towards the end she sings forgive in a few different languages then in English. This is one of my favorite tracks and is supposed the second single.    Future Lovers: Very different sound from the whole album. This one was produced by Mirwais Ahmadzai who is credited for producing her Music and American Life album. She sings this songs in a very seductive voice and sings \\"would you like to try and come with me\\". She sings \\"give me evidence of this brilliance\\" referring to the love. This has a futuristic disco feel to it and the synthesizers they use do wonders for this song. This is also very dancebale track and one of my favorites and I hope it becomes a single too. This type of sound puts you in a trance. The music goes into I love New York and you can hear a little of Ray Of Light while blends into the next tune.     I Love New York:My favorite track. This is by far the most danceable track on this album. The beats are very intense and has a rock feel to it. This song is brilliant. The lyrics are funny. Madonna sings \\" I don't like cities but I like New York other places make me feel like a dork\\" At the end you hear cop sirens going off. She sings this song with an attitude and near the end she sings \\" get off of my street\\" several times, its just great!!    Let It Will Be: Oddly titled track beginns with the violin and is very similar to the beginning of Papa Don't Preach from the True Blue album. She sings about success and fame. The chorus part is great and I love this song.    Forbidden Love: This is the slowest track on the album but is not a ballad. This title can also be found on Madonna's Bedtime Stories Album but this one is a lot better. The vocoder is used and she sings \\"forbidden love are we supposed to be together\\" and then sings it without the vocoder. This song is also very emotional and sad. The ending ends with numbers being count backwards from 5 and during each one a love line is said. This is just a beautiful song. This songs slowly blends into Jump. The way is blends is is pure genious.    Jump: Starts extacly like the beginning of West End Girls by the Pet Shop Boys. This is just a fun song and she sings \\"Are you Ready to jump, just take my hand get ready to jump.  When she sings these lines you seriously want to get up and jump. She also sings \\"I work and I fight till I find a place of my own\\" referring back to her early years in the 80's.    How High: The vocoder is used again and it has a robotic sound to it in the beginning. Madonna sings and questions her fame again as she did in Let It Will Be and sings\\" was it all worth it\\" and \\"should I carry on will it matter when I'm gone\\". This song has grown on me a lot and has a great beat to it.  It was also produced by Mirwais and Bloodshy and Avant.    Issac: A masterpiece by itself. It starts of like similar to sounds youwould hear in a lullaby story and then you hear a rabbi's chanting in the back. This song is obviously Kabbalah related. Madonna sings \\"wrestle with your darkness angels call your name can you hear what they are saying will you ever be the same\\" then you hear the chorus and the chanting again then she sings other versus and the chanting and the chorus follows through again. This songs usues quite a few sounds mixed in well expecially towards the end. There is a pounding sound an a few times near the end it's amazing then the chorus. It ends with a man talking.I find this song brilliant and hope it becomes a single. This track is the longest track a little more than 6 minutes, its brilliant though.    Push: Another genious pop blend from Issac. This song has a good hip hop feeling to it and if you listen to it it does have a little rap in it. Madonna sings \\"You push me\\" then in a hip hop rap fashion sings\\" to go the extra mile\\" and \\"when it's difficult to smile\\". This song she sings to her husband Guy Ritchie. The chorus is the best part and has such a happy feeling to it and is similar to \\"Don't Tell Me\\" from her Music Album.    Like It Or Not:  A nice song to end this brilliant album. She sings \\"this is who I am you can like it or not you can love me or leave cause I'm never gonna stop\\". This song is mid tempo and not really fast. It ends beautifully with the guitars. Overall I give this album an A+. I dont skip any song. I would highly recommend it if you really want to dance hard!! Also don't forget to check out Madonna's American Life album a very underrated album indeed!
B0002858YS|3.0|The amount of 5 star reviews for this CD is obscene given its disjointed sound, cliched riffs and inconsistent level of lyrical matter. Undoubtedly the same reviewers who worship Nickelback. <br /> <br />Objectively, as a eclectic student to all forms of music, from avant-garde jazz to metal to the classics. I find mainstream music like this EXTREMELY UNORIGINAL. The Killers, I'm afraid, sound average here. \\"What's the Hot Fuss about the Killers?\\" I ask. This album does not break new ground or even rehash old sounds very well. Lyrics from songs like Somebody Told Me are immature and superficial. I'll grant you, bands don't need to metaphorise like Gildenlow or Petrucci, but these lyrics sound really HALF-BAKED. <br /> <br />Brandon Flowers, lead singer of the Killers, has absolutely NO CHARISMA. Every concert revolves around him picking a spot and standing there for the entire duration. Bashing other bands like The Bravery? The Killer's music aren't that much better, you know. <br /> <br />What's the Hot Fuss about? The Killers are merely average.
B00080ZG10|5.0|The Aviator is a throroughly enjoyable movie about the early years of that eccentric millionaire,Howard Hughes. He was larger than life even then, and the film is very well made. The sets, the costumes, the performances, the script--Everything is as it should be. It has been said that Leonardo Di Caprio was miscast in the role of Hughes, but I don't agree. I think he makes an interesting Howard, a guy I personally wish I'd known.
047119350X|2.0|Before you buy this book, you must carefully ask yourself what purpose you intend to use this for.  As a textbook it is horrible, but will serve you well as reference material.  V&V was inflicted upon me by my professor in my single-semester graduate level biochemistry course (I am a first year student working towards a PhD in Molecular Biology).  The course was structured so that we were tested once a month on about 8-12 chapters of this book. Therefore, I did not have much time to dwell for very long on each chapter and was tested in significantly less detail than what was presented in the text.  The problem, as others have stated, was that the author goes into excruciating detail for each component of the chapter and then fails to state exactly why it is important.  For example, the text will spend two pages describing exactly how many beta sheets and alpha helixes an enzyme has, its folding substructures, the critical amino acid residues in the active sites, and what substrate analogs researchers used to elucidate the enzyme's function.   Somewhere buried in that mess will be a few words on why the enzyme is related or important to the topic of the chapter.  For most people, you will never ever need to know 95% of this material unless you are personally involved in research directly related to this topic.  Otherwise you would be a complete fool to waste so much time memorizing the intimate details of all the proteins and molecules.  Unfortunately with this text, the nitty-gritty details are not placed aside from the main points so that you can skip over them when need be.  Instead you are forced to wade through the endless morass of minutia to find the few hidden gems of general principles.
B000000132|5.0|This 1974 release opens with the 9'34\\" Running Hard, which is ushered in with a classical flourish on the acoustic piano courtesy of excellent player John Tout.  John Camps superb, trebly Rickenbacker bass provides some nice counterpoint and then the rest of the band gradually joins in, with the delicate soprano of Annie Haslam soaring above. The music of Renaissance is extremely disciplined and the instrumentation and playing style is more in keeping with a symphony orchestra than a rock band.  Keyboardist John Tout uses the acoustic piano exclusively with some minor organ and harpsichord work, and does not use synthesizers at all on this recording (if they are used, they are buried deep in the mix).  Electric guitars are also absent, which further emphasizes the classical approach.  Perhaps the only thing missing from this recording is the \\"tap-tap-tap\\" of an impatient conductor tapping his baton on the stand!  It is only John Camps bass work and to a much lesser extent, Terence Sullivans drumming that lend the rock aspect to the compositions.  I might add that Terence Sullivan is a very sensitive drummer (he is more of a symphony percussionist) and engages in a dialogue with the acoustic piano rather than bulldozing over it.  This is largely attributable to his emphasis on cymbal/high-hat/snare work rather than heavy beats on the bass drum/floor toms.  The pieces on Turn of the Cards include three short pieces that range from 3'01\\" to 6'25\\" (I think of You, Black Flame, Cold is Being) and three longish pieces in the 9'00 - 9'30\\" range (Running Hard, Things I don't Understand, Mother Russia).  There are some absolutely beautiful and haunting moments on this CD including Cold is Being, which is based on Albinoni's excessively melodramatic Adagio for Organ and Strings in G minor.  Although Albinoni is not credited on the piece, there is a \\"thanks to\\" Albinoni cited in the liner notes, in addition to a \\"thanks to\\" composer Jehain Alain (1911-1940) for the introduction to Running Hard.  Alain was not credited on the composition either.  In summation, this is a wonderful recording made during the period of peak creativity for this band (1973-1977) and is recommended to prog fans that also appreciate classical music.  If you like this recording, also check out Ashes are Burning (1973); Scheherezade and other Stories (1975); and Novella (1977).n to Running Hard.  Alain was not credited on the composition either.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|I find this special edition just plain wrong. Its okay to release special editions, but do it after your album has been deemed 'a classic' (for example, Mariah's wonderful Christmas album) or at least 5 years after the original release. To see her releasing four versions of the same cd (not including the International versions, which includes an extra song or two, not included on the US release) less than 12 months after the original release shows the length some artists and their record companies will take to make a buck (another example is Usher). I find this behavior even more distasteful because it is clear they are taking advantage of the Christmas holiday. I am a longtime fan of Mariah, but this shameless act will make me think twice about purchasing another cd from her. I do not like it when artists treat their fans as dummies. The music from this release is not even Mariah's best work and shows her relying more and more on her producers (check out my review from the original release). Plus, \\"Dont forget about us\\" sounds like the remix version of \\"We Belong Together\\". This season has been a let down from all my favorite female singers (from Madonna's bland and boring release to Mariah's desperate and shameless re-release). We, as music fans, deserve more than what we are getting this year.   * I also think fans need to stop making this a Mariah vs. Madonna thing. Where does it say you can't be a fan of both ladies. They are getting rich over this feud and neither one of them has done work this year that is worth fighting for.

Gabrielle is a schemer and Suszane is just clumbsy.   Bree is just out there!   All good thing when wrtiing characters for a # 1 show. <br /> <br />Shout out to the cast and director!
B000929AJQ|4.0|In this CD, With Teeth, Reznor bares his soul in ways he has yet to show.  Amazingly a lot of the songs on this Cd are softer than his older stuff and not quite as explicit as his older songs such as Closer.  I was somewhat disappointed to see that Reznor and Interscope did not include an insert booklet with this CD and I feel like i was perhaps cheated out of an otherwise good deal.  Yet the musical quality on this CD made up for the lack of a booklet within the CD case.  I recomend this Cd to any Nine Inch Nail fan or anyone just now getting into Nine Inch Nails, yet i would be faster at recomending his older albums.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|After repeated listenings, I'm finding Amarantine NOT to be formulaic ENYA but very unique from her earlier recordings.  Sure it has Enya's musical idiosyncrasies and that's a good thing.  Anyway, my family and I love it.  Sure hope it's not another 60 months till her next release.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|The last song we heard by System of a Down was Mezmerize's soft thought provoker \\"Lost in Hollywood\\", wondering what the hell Daron, Serj, Shavo and John were gonna do next. And we have found out; above all, they did not disappoint. When the first riff from Attack starts, you think to yourself \\"This album is gonna be insane...\\" but then it slows down in typical SOAD fashion. This album rocks from Attack to the final spine chilling moment of Soldier Side. The most insane song the band has ever done is here in the form of Vicinity of Obscenity.  <br />Holy Mountains is the longest song on the album, and it kinda serves as a part II to Toxicity's Aerials. But Aerials is better.  <br /> <br />This album rocks, buy it.
B000A88F22|3.0|I consider myself a true fan of Britney Spears. I have all her albums, DVDs, many singles and really support her career, since the very first time I watched \\"Baby one more time\\" video, on MTV, back in 1999. Maybe that's the reason why I was shocked when I watched \\"Chaotic\\" on UPN. Even though Britney was involved in a few scandals -- which include the 24 hour marriage with her former friend Jason Alexander, the annulment of it, the secret marriage with Kevin Federline,etc --\\"Chaotic\\" is the definitive proof that the age of innocence has come to the end. What we watch on \\"Chaotic\\" is a face of Britney no fan would like to see. The reality show reveals the intimacy of Britney and Kevin, in such a way  that really disappointed me. The part where britney asks questions about sex sounds really vulgar and she is exposed to critics and midia in general, which did not forgive her. In the show, Kevin behaves as if he is taking advantage of Britney's fame and I'd rather think this is not true, for Britney's sake, especially after the birth of Sean Preston.    Nevertheless, this CD+DVD package is really worthy, if you are a fan of Mrs. Federline. I love the videos of \\"Someday (I'll understand)\\" -- which seems to me like Britney's redemption after \\"Chaotic\\" -- and of \\"Do somethin'\\", which is really fun. The bonus CD is cool, with the unreleased tracks \\"Monalisa\\", \\"Chaotic\\" and \\"Someday (I'll understand)\\". This is the reason why I give it 3 stars.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Hmm, while I don't particularily like Avril (the music's pop, its catchy -- thats what a team of songwriters like the Matrix were aiming for)its quite obvious to me after reading all your rants about MTV Supporter's review and then reading the actual review...its all sarcasm, people. \\"better than jimi hendrix\\"? \\"posers like the clash\\"? the best punk album ever? even a die hard avril fan couldn't say that.  <br /> <br />that said, <br /> <br />the album grows on you. buy it if you want some pop music to sing along to every once in a while. the hooks are catchy and avril's vocal stylings are unique - annoyingly so to some, refreshing to others. just don't take it all - the marketing, the PR, the \\"image\\" too seriously. its pop from a girl with a whole lot of good business minds behind her. after all, all you angry people are still here writing reviews, right?
B00005JO1J|5.0|Having seen the Broadway show about 20 times, I am an admitted purist. I was excited to see the show but a bit concerned that it would not live up to its theatrical counterpart. Perhaps due to the brilliant casting of most of the original Broadway actors, RENT lived up to, and in some cases, surpassed it. I missed a lot of the omitted songs but I understand that it was decided to shave a few in lieu of dialogue which fleshed out the characters and story a bit more. But, Goodbye Love, Christmas Bells and Happy New Year were great songs that are sorely missed. Rosario and Tracie were were brilliant as newcomers, but Adam, Idina, Wilson, Jesse, Anthony and Taye brought the passion and fire to the roles they created with a magic that is seldom captured anywhere other than live theatre. Bravo!!!
B00005JO1U|5.0|So I'm 14. Not the brand of person to go and see such a movie for my own gratification; it really was one of those 'well, it's the only thing playing...' sort of deals; like you were almost FORCED to go via ennui.     I would have NEVER comprehended sitting through Zathura at the edge of my seat, encouraging and cheering the siblings and the stranded Astronaut on with every ounce of oomph I could (I might have been screaming it out loud too...) rally, laughing out loud at Danny's charming personality and loving the benevolence maturity of Walter as the film progressed. The action is exhilarating for the kids and prudently done for the parents and a tale that redefines BRILLIANCE and, dare I saw, overtakes the area of Jumonji and all its glory. Zathura is not only a thriller with a plethora of feat and battle, but also a case in point of siblinghood and collaboration shown in such a way it's sure to be super glued to your memory. More than just a film, it's an exemplar for all disagreements of family, clearly not only by telling but SHOWING you that it really does take two; or three and possibly even four hundreds. The numbers could matter less; it's the moral behind the turn of the key and the little tin rocket ships on the board game.     A brilliant film with a three dimensional story for the entire family, young, old, my age, whatever, I command that you see it with anyone you can find. They don't want to go? Drag them blood, tooth and nail into the theater by their legs if you must. It's worth every scratch, every penny and every single moment.     I'm seeing it for the third time tomorrow.     Heh, I'm insane, I know.
0743454537|5.0|This book was my selection in my book club last month.  It came under high recommendation from my aunt.  This book was an excellent book along with being a quick read.
B000059T00|5.0|The Cult of Clapton tends to state that EC is the ultimate rock don who makes everything he touches, from the sheer power of his greatness. How is it, then, that all the great things he did were with other great people? Want EC w/out a great supporting cast? Go buy \\"Lay Down Sally.\\" Not to knock him, he is one of the great guitarists of all time. But come on, most people say Cream broke up because Clapton was sick of Jack Bruce acting like the front man, and then he ended up in two groups that he only lasted one album with (this and Derek and the Dominoes). Of course, they are two of the greatest rock albums of all time. To his credit, Clapton clearly brings out the best in others, though this album testifies to the fact that they often bring out the best in him as well. For instance, to me, \\"Do What You Like\\" is one of the greatest songs in the history of rock and roll. It's written by Ginger Baker? Amazing. (And to his credit, EC has repeatedly acknowledged the fact that Ginger Baker is the most amazing drummer of all time.) Clapton's solo in \\"Do What You Like\\" is one of my favorites of his: fantastic playing and a beautiful tone with a haunting dose of reverb that really works.<br /><br />Steve Winwood is an great vocalist, and it is truly hard to figure out why if you use the \\"American Idol\\" metrics. But on this album, the fusion of his bluesy style and the material, which is haunting and hypnotic, is just plain magic. From the opening bars of \\"Had to Cry Today,\\" this album reverberates in a way that few other albums do and Winwood's vocals are a big part of that.<br /><br />It continues to astound me how many people out there have not heard this record. Searing, unique, incredibly powerful album.
B000002NJS|5.0|I am big Madonna fan myself.  I loved her since the \\"Borderline\\" days.  I have copies of \\"Like A Virgin,\\" \\"True Blue,\\" \\"Like A Prayer,\\" \\"Immaculate Collection,\\" \\"Erotica,\\" \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" \\"Something to Remember,\\" \\"Music,\\" and \\"American Life.\\" These were all great pop albums, but I am looking for songs which I really can relate to my emotions.  If you're also looking for the same thing that I do...you're in the right place.  It's the \\"Ray of Light\\" album. <br /> <br />I will not dare review all of the singles, simply coz I'm too lazy to type:-).  I will just review the songs which simply appealed most to my heart: \\"Frozen,\\" \\"The Power of Goodbye,\\" and \\"To Have and Not to Hold.\\"  These 3 tracks is enough to make you purchase the album and say to yourself: \\"Damn, I made a good purchase!\\" <br /> <br />1) \\"Frozen\\"---A song perfect to dedicate to someone who you really love but can't love you back, but you're still hoping that he/she would open your heart to you.  It's like a chant actually...its like invoking to a Superior Being and asking him to make that person love you back.  Madonna is also trying to convince the one that she loves to \\"melt\\" his heart and eventually love her.  Clever and optimistic thought.  The sound effects here are enchanting.  I listen to this song when I feel \\"down,\\" as I try to move on.  Its somewhat comforting and reassuring, just like a pill... <br /> <br />2)\\"The Power of Goodbye\\"---Perfect song for someone trying to move on.  You're trying to convince yourself to let go...but sometimes it's just damn hard to say \\"goodbye\\" to someone you really love who hasn't loved you back.  One of the most emotional Madonna songs ever---with the lines \\"There's nothing left to lose, there's no more heart to bruise.\\"  I love the lyrics, which was aided even more by its sound effects.  I imagine myself to be in Near East when I listen to this---it has a certain \\"Middle Eastern feel\\" to it.  Video is great too---a vacation house near a beach is a perfect place to meditate and mend your broken heart... <br /> <br />3)\\"To Have and Not to Hold\\"---Perfect song for someone who you really have an attraction on, but you can't pursue him/her due to certain constraints.  Its like blaming your heart for falling for this certain guy or girl, but you shouldn't.  A good example---falling for your classmate but can't pursue him/her because he/she likes someone else, so both of you can end up as close friends---but not intimate lovers.  This happens to me all the time, and when it happens, I always play this song:-) <br /> <br />Other excellent tracks are \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\"---perfect for travelers of \\"life,\\"  \\"Shanti Ashtangi,\\"---very mesmerizing, you can even dance to it in the end.  \\"Ray of Light\\"---the song in which Madonna delivered her most powerful vocals ever, and \\"Mer Girl,\\"---very mysterious.  In here Madonna became a visionary, just like Bjork. <br /> <br />BOTTOMLINE: Don't patronize my review.  BUY this album yourself and give it a try.  Trust me, you will be enchanted and you won't regret it... <br /> <br />
0060090383|5.0|Marian Keyes describes in her book \\"Postcards from the Bed\\" her struggle with alcoholism and overcoming her dependency.  While reading this I was keenly interested in everything I read, because Marian Keyes has been there and done that and it's an accurate account of what really goes on.  I laughed a lot, had a few tears but mostly I just keep picking up the book and reading chapters again and again, it was so well written and so funny. <br /> <br />Rachel Walsh is not a drug addict, at least that's what she thinks. <br /> <br />She lives in New York with her best friend, has a crap job, a gorgeous boyfriend who she alternates between wildly loving and finding embarrassing, and likes to party and have a good time.  But then one night she gets a bit carried away and Margaret her sensible older sister is despatched from Ireland to bring her home.  She then loses her job and boyfriend and best friend too, and decides she will give in and go home to Ireland and allow herself to be put into the 'Cloisters', a drying out facility.  What the heck she needs a holiday anyway and she's looking forard to all the massages, beauty treatments and hob-nobbing with celebrities... <br /> <br />The truth of the matter is decidedly different, and Rachel is in for a shock. <br /> <br />As an aside, some of the stuff in this book helped me give up smoking, another type of drug addiction.  A great read from a masterful and witty author.
0793518326|5.0|Yes, it's true that there are errors.  Yes, it does need an update and inclusion of \\"Free As A Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\".  But what this book does provide is nothing short of amazing.  As a MIDI sequencing tool it is utterly indispensible.  Just to have the accurate drum score for \\"Oh Darling\\" is enough to justify the price of this book - and I purchased it when it first came out for $60.  I have used this book innumerble times for a quick hit on a certain part that my brain just couldn't seem to work out.  As previously mentioned the trumpet part in \\"Penny Lane\\" is a work of art and faithfully transcribed in this volume.  I can't help but wonder if the Beatles had any clue when writing and recording these tunes that they would be so scrutinized.  This is definitely worth the purchase price for any level of musician, Beatles' fan or not.  (Provided your eyesight can be corrected with reading glasses.)
B000028U0Y|5.0|If the new biopic movie \\"Walk the Line\\" is to be believed - the record company didn't particularly want Cash back after his spell on drugs and booze; they didn't want an album of his usual stuff and they certainly didn't want a live album recorded in a prison.  But this is it. <br /> <br />I always equated the raw energy and uneven performance to Cash being nervous about the setting and in 1968 when first released - even in its highly edited form - most of the album could not be played on the UK's BBC Radio where it was basically banned.  But everyone knew of it and it was a huge underground hit.  In this resotred format with the swearing back in place and the CD allowing more tracks it is a raw and powerful live concert. <br /> <br />However after viewing \\"Walk the Line\\" it is clear Cash was also slightly desperate to prove himeself again without the help of drugs or booze.  For sure he played for the prisoners who wrote him but he also played to find himself and the first half is marred by nervous jokes and uneven playing and singing.  The prisoners didn't care and their energy carried him through. <br /> <br />I have no idea if this album is presented in the play order of the day but if it is the last third is interesting.  He and June Carter play possibly one of their best recordings of \\"Jackson\\" and she seems to steady him because the last part of the album is much more evenly sung and in key.  Johnny finds himself and (possibly) so as not to leave the prisoners too uncontrollable tones down the last couple of numbers including the one written by prisoner Glen Shirley to finish the show (though listen for the way the whole band ups the tempo mid chorus at one point - to fit the remaining tape time?) <br /> <br />Along with the best live recording I've ever heard of \\"Orange Blossom Special\\" this was one of Johnny Cash's rediscoveries of himself and it is surely worth listening to for that - what better way to comeback from your personal hell than by playing in hell.
B00005JO1J|4.0|It wouldn't be fair to expect the film version of \\"Rent\\" to completely live up to the original Broadway show, but Chris Columbus' production does a pretty good job. This is a great example of a musical that has been successfully adapted to the big screen. However, there are definitely some kinks that prevent me from giving this movie five stars.<br /><br />\\"Rent\\" is a rock opera that was loosely based on Puccini's \\"La Boh&egrave;me\\" and also contains elements reminiscent of \\"West Side Story.\\" The story revolves around an eclectic group of young people living in New York City that are coping with a world filled with corruption, anger, and disease. With the exception of Rosario Dawson as Mimi and Tracie Thoms as Joanne, the entire Broadway cast returned to star in the film version of the show, and that's what makes this movie so great. The performances are emotionally riveting and the music is absolutely phenomenal.<br /><br />I don't understand why it took Hollywood almost ten years to turn \\"Rent\\" into a movie. Even though the cast is every bit as it was ten years ago, it's kind of weird to see that all of the characters are a decade older than they're supposed to be. The film feels kind of dated when you watch it: although Aids and homosexuality are still topics of discussion, they aren't the issues at the forefront of our lives anymore, and I hope that doesn't turn off people who are experiencing \\"Rent\\" for the first time.<br /><br />There are a couple of nitpicky issues I have with the movie, and the first is the omission of the song \\"Goodbye Love.\\" Ordinarily, I can completely understand that directors have to cut material for film adaptations, but I read an interview with Columbus in which he said that he chose to cut the song because he thought it was \\"too emotional to deal with after Angel's death.\\" WHAT?! Talk about disrespecting someone else's artistic choices and completely belittling the mentality of your audience in the process! That was just ridiculous. Also, the film was supposed to be set in 1989, but I never would have picked up on that if the characters hadn't made reference to it a couple of times...everything looked like it was supposed to be set in the present day. The only other \\"clue\\" about the time period that Columbus threw into the film was a poorly-placed shot of the World Trade Center, which I thought was tasteless and kind of sloppy. There were also some very stupid camera shots in the film, such as that awful close-up of Adam Pascal when he's singing \\"Your Eyes\\" to his beloved Mimi...he looked so ridiculous that it completely ruined the moment. Also, there were some issues with poor character development in the film. That had nothing to do with the actors' performances: certain elements of the story just didn't transfer very well to the big screen. For example, poor Taye Diggs (who is a very good actor) had nothing to do during most of the film and just wandered around looking like a lost puppy dog. It was a real waste of some extraordinary talent. Oh well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good movie. The cast is wonderful and the music is spectacular. The not-so-great things about the film are all Chris Columbus' fault, so maybe someone should tell him not to make any movies for a while.Also, the film was supposed to be set in 1989, but I never would have picked up on that if the characters hadn't made reference to it a couple of times...everything looked like it was supposed to be set in the present day.

B00005JO17|1.0|I thought Chicken Little would be a safe bet for my 4 year old son.  Was I wrong!  I read newspaper reviews to get a \\"feel\\" for the movie and did not get any indication that this movie would be inappropriate for younger kids.  Plus it's rated G - we have seen other G films from Disney without issue.  It looks like Disney is stretching their concept of what is a G film.  Thanks for the nightmares Disney!  What were you thinking?  Our hero boards an alien ship and a \\"lab\\" area with pulsating tubelar \\"organs\\" in suspended jars.  The music is appropriately eerie to add to the scary effect.  \\"What are those mommy?\\".  \\"Will they be ok?\\".  Then Chicken and his friends run into 2 very large spidery mechanical creatures with menancing domed heads.  When the aliens chase the gang away, it's with blade wielding propellers that can mow down a corn field.  Later the aliens attack the town with lasers, zapping characters into apparent nothingness.   \\"Mommy, where did Foxy go?\\"  \\"Why are they shooting everyone?\\".  And to make matters worse, the scenes are rather drawn out.  I tell my son, \\"You'll see, hang on....\\" and it just plays on!  What a terrible movie for kids.  Don't take any child younger than 6 or at least not to a theatre viewing of this movie.  It's just too much to absorb via big screen.  Only jaded, bored kids would not be bothered by the scenes in this movie.

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and it made me love Marlon Brando.  <br />Vivien Leigh's performance couldn't have been better. She should be remembered as a great actress-not just as Scarlett O'Hara. <br />Karl Malden gives a great performance as well-as usual! <br />All in all a superb film, and one of the best plays by Tennesse Williams (you should read the play as well)!

6304806418|5.0|MADONNA in a movie and singing! What more could a person ask for? Okay, perhaps some people aren't as big of a Madonna fan as I am, but this movie was right on the money. There is no one that could have played Eva Peron the way that Madonna did. She completely captured the character, and was wonderful in the movie. Madonna won the Golden Globe for this movie, and it was deserved! <br />There are so many beautiful scenes in this movie, so I cannot pick just one, but I recommend this movie to anyone that likes Madonna, is interested in South American history (keep in mind this is a musical though-but I think it gives a great portrayal of Eva Peron), or to any movie buff (or musical fan)!
B000063DFQ|5.0|this is probably my favorite maiden album of all time, every song is great.
0800141865|5.0|I love this movie, and I recommend this movie to anyone that does not like Larry Flynt-it has the potential to change your opinion. This movie was tongue in cheek, and it was tragic. This wonderfully directed and acted movie will show people that Larry Flynt may not be the most moral person (in some people's minds), but it shows that he has fought for every American's rights.  <br />Courtney Love blew me away as Larry Flynt's late wife. Every movie I've seen with her, she proves that she has a talent, and this movie let her shine with her acting ability.
B0000630BT|3.0|Painkiller is easily priest's most overated album.

0553801503|4.0|\\"A Feast for Crows\\", the fourth novel in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga, continues the adventures of half the earlier characters next to new additions.  Character interaction and internal dialog maintains the excellent storyline quality along with scandalous encounters and political drama.  The series is grim fantasy, filled with brutal and extreme experiences and not for the carefree reader.<br /><br />In the past when main characters died other minor individuals were promoted thereby balancing out the number but more are elevated than gone with this novel.  Additionally, magic earns a minor appearance.  I hope the author has not written himself into a tight corner with this literary direction.<br /><br />As stated in the final chapter (not related to the storyline), the author divided the original narrative leaving out many character chapters (among them Tyrion, Jon, Dany, Stannis and Melisandre, Davos Seaworth) for the subsequent \\"[[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons]]\\".  The novel, which focuses on King's Landing, could have been thinned down however it would not have been enough to include everybody.  Post battle actions with individual reflection or adventuring to fulfill a goal govern the pace while a number of noteworthy events are briefly referenced.  While not as powerful or precise, the storyline does entertain even if not at the high level for a series as distinctive.<br /><br />A greater assortment of major and minor characters, from lords to stable boys, requires a more detailed appendix, perhaps a section in alphabetical order.  A small dictionary of important words would be valuable.  Some portions of the map could have incorporated further detail especially the continents where the story relates.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.

0553296981|4.0|When reading someone's diary, one probably shouldn't expect a story, but Anne Frank's diary is certainly a very well structured story.  Of course it doesn't include the end, but the end is already known... in a sense, the spoiler is what is necessary to understand to feel the sort of tragedy that this book gives off from a generally inquisitive and happier narrator.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of this book is how early on Anne says, \\"I'd like to learn about psychology since I don't know much about it,\\" but her experiences in a sort of abnormal sociological situation presents a lot more truth and depth to her understandings of the workings of human thought than I've ever seen described by a psychologist.  Honestly, something about the forced quietness and the lack of physical freedom creates a level of introspection that is a lot more observational than typical day-to-day life.  In short, Anne Frank became very wise in the two years or so she was writing this diary, so much that she is actually much more wise than the typical person living today.<br /><br />So we have a narrative, and we have very well-written psychological observation, and we have a tragic end.  It's a set-up to a great classic, basically.<br /><br />Many people say that it's a real shame Anne Frank didn't live to be a great writer.  Well, in a sense, it's a bit too late to overly worry about it; I'd take this book as it is.  If anybody's interested in more works by Anne Frank, there's a publication called \\"Stories from the Secret Annex\\" that you can look into that detail some of her writings she did as gifts and time-killers while in hiding.  There is a lot more out there to expand upon and explore beyond this little document, but this document is a very good starting place.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB

The characters come alive, their emotions and thoughts are so vivid, they make reality feel distant. <br />I am sad to see so many complaints about \\"boring\\" chapters in this book. This was not my experience at all. His characters are as complex and varied as....well, people. I feel as if I know the characters. The characters change over time, but do so believably (i.e. Jaime). Martin is a master of making the stories fantastic and realistic at the same time. If you want self-aggrandizing action and glam, go read the latest Mack Bolan and buy a Playboy or just channel surf). If you want something with a little more depth, pick up \\"a Feast..\\" It's worth the journey.

B00007J36V|5.0|I received my CD very quickly & at a great price. I'd definitiely buy from you again . . . and look forward to doing so in the future.
B000000OAN|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums of all time, I can't stand when people mention albums like nirvan's \\"nevermind\\" A night at the opera is a masterpiece, every song is brilliant. My favs are \\"death on two legs\\" \\"love of my life\\" and obviously \\"bo Rap\\" actually every song is my favorite. Great album.
6304806418|4.0|When Evita originally came out, it was considered a mild disappointment. It was pretty successful, got mixed to favorable reviews, and won some awards, but it had so much Oscar hype before its release that its lack of major nominations caused it to be seen as a bit of a failure. This is unfortunate, because it's actually a much better movie than most pictures that win the big awards. The acting is generally excellent, particularly from Madonna. It's beautifully photographed. The music is usually very well done, with great singing (there are points where Madonna's fantastic singing will make you wonder why she never seems to pull that level of vocals off on her albums). Some people complain that the singing isn't as opera-oriented than the original show, but given the mainstream audience this was clearly an intentional decision. <br /> <br />The movie has its faults. The main, overwhelming problem with this movie is its loyalty to the original play. Don't listen to purists who claim this movie strayed from the original. The fact is that they kept this virtually all-musical, something that doesn't work nearly as well on screen as it would on stage. The main problem with this decision was that the story has a great deal of political and historical content, and the songs that are supposed to give you this background don't do a very good job of giving you an understanding of the history. Three almost unlistenable songs--Peron's Latest Flame, Rainbow Tour, And the Money Kept Rolling In--try to give you this background in the context of overbearing musical-theatre-rock. The style of those songs and the flashiness of the editing, not to mention Antonio Banderas's sometimes indecipherable accent, keep any of this important historical information from being understood by the vast majority of the audience. You see flashy clips of riots, people being beaten (by police? be rebels? who knows?), and politicians yelling at each other (about what?), with nothing but Andrew Lloyd Weber's trashy theatre-\\"rock\\" to explain--or not really explain--what's happening. People who dislike this movie, I suspect, are largely thinking back to this part of the movie. All they had to do to eliminate most of the problems people have with this movie would be to take out the weak songs, add some real, non-musical scenes that give comprehensible historical background, and only keep the really good songs. <br /> <br />This could have been a great movie. You get a real sense of Eva Peron as a person, and the story is moving at times. Madonna is great and should have been nominated for an Oscar. Many of the songs are excellent. It's also worth praising for its photography alone. It's a shame they didn't do anything to mend such glaring, relatively easily fixable flaws, because it could have been far more successful.
B00004TH7Z|1.0|this is probably my least favorite album from maiden, every song is long and boring. why is this album so overpraised?...it's just not very good.
B00005JNX0|5.0|I LOVE this Movie!! It is so funny!! I love the penguins!!
B0000BYM3K|1.0|i'll keep this nice and short, this is maiden's worst album with bruce. The best word that comes to mind explaining this album is\\"dull\\"
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Ok...I am a Madonna fan. I want to state that right off the bat. So no, this isn't exactly an objective review of Confessions On A Dance Floor, but I've given it two complete listenings and I have to give M props for doing it again and coming back after American Life. <br /> <br />My reaction to first listening of these songs was that I didn't like them at all, in fact I only found two songs on the CD that were listening to, those two being: \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\". I was completely disappointed with it.  <br /> <br />Today, I got the CD back out and gave it another thorough listening, which is something anyone should do who reviews any type of music or movie. I don't believe you should ever review something in one sitting! <br /> <br />So today, I listened again with the same negativity in mind that I had yesterday when I listened to it, but today something different happened when listening to it more closely: my negativity toward the record seemed to fade and I caught myself bobbing my head to the beat, slowly I began to sway and before I knew it I was wanting to dance! Wow! She did it again!  <br /> <br />There are some weak spots on this album but they don't detract from the work as a whole. The entire album is worth buying for \\"Let It Will Be\\" alone! Still some of my other favorites are \\"Jump\\" and \\"Push\\".  <br /> <br />If you are a Madonna fan, buy this album...you're gonna love it if you give it a chance. If you're not a Madonna fan, buy this album, cause she'll make you one!
B00005R62K|5.0|stained class and sad wings are my two favorite priest albums. every songs a keeper.
B00005JO1P|5.0|My Wife, Son and Myself viewed the movie. All of us have different tastes, and we all loved it. Can't wait for the DVD to come out. I would recomend !
B000000OAH|5.0|one of queens least popular, but it's still fantastic. The album has only one bad song (more of that jazz) but the rest is great. My favs are \\"mustapha\\" \\"fat bottomed girls\\" and freddie's \\"don't stop me now\\" Jazz is a nice mixture of rocker's (dead on time) and great ballads (dreamers ball) if you only like one style of music queen arn't for you, stick to ACDC if that's the case. queen were musically all over the place, that's why they were so great.
B000BB1MHS|4.0|I finally got around to seeing Tim Burton's remake of Roald Dahl's \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\". As much as I love the 1971 version \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" starring Gene Wilder, I thought this new version was just as good. Johnny Depp as the eccentric, mysterious Willy Wonka was hilarious. I definitely could see the Michael Jackson comparisons in the way Willy Wonka spoke and attitude. \\"Finding Neverland\\" co-star Freddie Highmore once again co-starred with Johnny Depp as the good-hearted Charlie, and was a delight to watch. Given his recent film roles, Freddie Highmore is going to be around in the film business for a  long time (I hope). He truly embodied the goodness and innocence in his character Charlie. The scenery in the candy factory was pure visual candy. It was stunning especially with the river of chocolate. I loved the oompah loompahs. Their musical numbers were hilarious although they did tend to drag on a bit which was one of the few flaws I found with the film. The flashbacks were interesting but again annoying. Then again they did serve its purpose and gave the viewer a glimpse into Willy Wonka's childhood. Christopher Lee was excellent as Willy's father with his deep, forboding voice. I loved it when the not-so nice children got their comeuppance especially Veruca Salt and the squirrels scene. Despite the minor flaws, Tim Burton did a fantastic job with his modern take on \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\".
B000063DI9|4.0|This is 4.5 album, almost a perfect maiden album. I think the first 5 were maiden's best, but somwhere in time and seventh son are very close and is the end of the maiden golden era. \\"moonchild\\" is probably my favorite.
B00005JO1J|5.0|Okay I saw the show three years ago and I loved it. I will admit though I had know idea what they were talking about only the music interested me. Everyone keeps saying that the movie wasnt as moving as the show was. I disagree! I was laughing and crying throughout the whole movie and the only thing I could say after it was done was that it was beautiful. The characters new and old were awesome! The only thing I missed about the movie that was in the show was the song Christmas Bells. All and all anyone who s a big fan of the show will love this movie and will want to see it again and again.
0380002930|4.0|I've read this book aloud three times over the last 12 years.  When children get to about age 10, they are ready for the adventure of Watership Down.  Pass along this treasure to your children.  You will be glad you did.
B000002UDG|1.0|Why in the world would anyone buy this single disc bare bones \\"best of\\" collection when, for just a dollar or two more, you could buy the double disc WINGSPAN? It's baffling to me why this is still in print. Unless you're really jonesin' for \\"Say, Say, Say\\" and a nice black and white pic of Macca with his Rickenbacher, buy WINGSPAN and you'll have the essential 70's and early 80's McCartney.
