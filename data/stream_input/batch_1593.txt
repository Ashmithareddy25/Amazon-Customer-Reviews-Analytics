0140623272|4.0|When I read Pride and Prejudice, four or five years back, I loved it.  With Sense and Sensibility, I finish a read through Austen's work with her first novel.  It is a strange genre, maybe, but I think Austen wrote as much for men as women, and there is something in her male characters, good and bad, for us to think about.<br /><br />Why Austen appeals to the Marxist in me, I cannot really explain.  Somewhere, on the edge of her books, the world is moving, rapidly, from a feudal society to one the Bourgeoisies.  Maybe there is an idea in a rewrite of Austen from the servant's point-of-view.  They are, as I read, only inches from the page.<br /><br />Sense and Sensibility is a decent example of Austen.  The characters are well drawn and do not suffer the familiar defects.  The story is somewhat predictable, but so are all her story-lines.  The story resolves a bit too quickly and neatly, and it ends far too abruptly, but, again, it is the same with all her story-lines.<br /><br />With S&S, I find that I cannot tell if Austen is parodying, as I have always believed, or if she is not, instead, pining for the world she depicts.  I think her readers probably wonder that about themselves sometimes.<br /><br />Probably I did not give the book as much attention as I could have, as I read three of her books in quick succession through the spring and summer in order to finish (be done) with her from my reading list.<br /><br />None of Austen's work can really approach P&P and so, for me, was somewhat disappointing in comparison.  I have also since, read Wuthering Heights and I think it somewhat eclipses Austen on all points except, maybe, that of pure language.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series video more than met my expectations. The only issue I had was due to the formatting of the accessing of the episodes and was beyond the distributers control.
1592402038|5.0|I don't know anyone that doesn't struggle with English punctuation. Lynne Truss provides an invaluable service to English language Geeks (like me) that need to know more than just the mechanics of punctuation, but the reasons behind it. Her engaging approach to explaining punctuation emphasizes the literary and historical dangers of poor English. Her obsession is contagious and her style is outrageous. I strongly recommend this book particularly for the common reader or writer. I absolutely guarantee this book will improve your writing and communicating skills while it entertains and delights you.

0767827694|4.0|I was very happy to finally get a DVD copy of this movie!  All the same story, historical flavor, scenes, music... and I still adore it.<br /><br />My problem is that the quality of the film is inconsistent through this version of the DVD: there are times when the quality is as bad or worse than my VHS tape!  (and no, I don't mean the scene near the end where the little girl is using a video camera)<br /><br />Fortunately there are other times when the picture is very clear and lacking any apparent marks or detritus on the film stock itself.<br /><br />I think anyone interested in a new look at life and our relationship to where (and when) we are would be interested in this movie!

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Story: 5/5<br />1: Being Vague, rambling plot with no little believable storyline<br />5: Ripping yarn, clever, thought provoking<br /><br />My title suggests that this could be an epic. The author has started a story here that began as a short story and has opened up into a vista of opportunity. Without a doubt, my biggest surprise read of 2012.<br /><br />I was introduced to this book via a Goidreads friends review, where the author became part of the discussion. I liked what he had to say (in a nut shell, he talked about being a reader as well as a writer) and decided that I would buy the book and give it a try. I have to admit to not being a big Dystopian fan. I am kind of over the whole post apocalypse thing, there is very little that I find new and engaging in the stories and I don't think that Wool gives anything really new in the whole after disaster story, but what it does do, is tell a good story at a great pace.<br /><br />The book is an omnibus of 5 books. I can see after reading book one why a lot of readers were asking for more. It was an interesting short read, had an interesting story line and begged for a story to be expanded on. Whilst the author builds the story with 4 more books I felt the entire read is one big novel, not 5 separate books. The stories flow on like chapters and I am sure a year from now, when this book is main stream and in its 4th print, that it will become one book.<br /><br />One thing that I loved about this book was the pace in the second half. There are a couple of POV's going on and it often cut away on the moment of danger, excitement or pending disaster and I found myself reading faster and faster to get back to the other POV. During the second half of the book I couldn't put it down. I could during book three, which I found the slowest. but in book five I read like a maniac. There is a section in the book where on of the lead characters Juliette has to dive deep under water with a hose system (like the old diving days)and the story slowly builds to the inevitable, and the tension is stunningly written. Even knowing what was coming, i still felt ill reading about the predicament she was in.<br /><br />There are parts that are a little rushed in the book and a couple of \\"oh that is convenient\\" moments, which I am sure will come out in all their glory with goodread reviewers, but you know what? This was a great story. I can totally see this adapted for tv and I would buy another installment of the story in an instant. The story itself could be huge, only limited by the time available to the author and how much he wants it to grow.<br /><br />Characters: 4/5<br />1: Unrealistic/unbelievable. Feel nothing for these characters<br />5: Fully engaged with the characters, believable. Researched.<br /><br />Characters in this books I would rate at about three and a half. There was some really good builds and I really felt like I got to know some of the characters well. Early characters in books one and two were excellent and I tink the Juliette role was pretty well done. I struggled with the Bernard character somewhat and didn't like the Lukas personality at all. I thought the way Bernard was being told in the second half of the book that there was devious nefarious plan in the background, but there wasn't and I kind of felt let down, that the story conveniently changed the personality to suit a quick resolution to a dilemma.<br /><br />Read Weight: Solid<br />Fluffy, Light, Solid, Heavy, Struggle<br /><br />Engagement: 4/5<br />1: Not fussed about finishing<br />5: Could stay up all night<br /><br />The last third of the book had to be read in one sitting. I could not imagine putting it down and coming back to it.<br /><br />Recommend: 5/5<br />1: Would advise you to read something else<br />5: Go read it now. It is THAT good<br /><br />Considering this was a self published book it was brilliantly written. I have read some many professionally published books that lacked the writing skillhere. I would have no qualms recommending this book, I think it has something for all.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Ever since I've downloaded this game one my Kindle Fire its become one of my favorite games.  The visuals are great, I love all the vibrant colors.  The game play is very simple and runs very smooth.  As you're playing through the game you even get to ride in a handful of crazy vehicles which can range from riding on top of a dragoon to beaming yourself around on a crazy teleporter.<br /><br />Then as you play you can collect coins and spin tokens.  The tokens are used to play the slots at the end of each game and prizes range from boost for your next game to coin jackpots.  You can use the coins to buy new jet-packs, outfits for your character, or gadgets to help you in the game.  You're allowed to equip up to two gadgets at a time.  Some gadgets will help you get more coins and spin tokens, others can help make it easier to get farther.  Some examples of these are the gravity belt which helps your character fall faster or the Air Barry which will help you jump more easily.  You can collect coins quiet easily so you don't need to make any in app purchases to play this game if you don't want to.<br /><br />There are also missions and trophies which give you different goals to achieve.  These can range from going so far in different vehicles to dodging so many obstacles.  As you complete these missions your character will level up and you'll be rewarded with even more coins!<br /><br />In the end, this is a fabulous game.  Anyone who downloads this app won't be disappointed.  It is so much fun to play.  You can easily get several hours of entertainment out of this game.
B00782O7IY|5.0|As the old saying goes, people go to the cinema to see actors act not talk. The Artist brings the art form of silent film into the modern era. It's unique and well done. In place of verbal dialogue, music befitting the emotion of the actor on screen sets the mood through much of the film with body and facial expressions telling the rest of the story. In most scenes, you can read their lips and on occasion, there are words posted on the screne as was done in the era of silent film. It's pretty cool and takes you back to the way people experienced cinema decades ago. I don't want to overlook the talented dog. He is amazingly smart and oh so charming.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a very clever puzzle game where as you are working on your puzzle you start forming a picture.  Along the sides of grids the numbers will tell you how many spaces in that row or column must be filled in.  If there are multiple numbers that lets you know that there gaps between the spaces you must fill-in.  At first it will just look like you're placing a lot of random dots but with patience it can be very rewarding to see what you end up creating. As you start to mark the more obvious spaces you start to gather information about where other rows and columns must be.  Sometimes, usually later into the puzzles, you may even be able to fill in the remaining spaces just by guessing what the picture is.<br /><br />As soon as I started playing the CrossMe series I was hooked.  It is fairly easy to learn, but challenging to master.  The game starts you with simple five by five grids but the hardest levels can get up to 100 times bigger!  Thankfully the game is divided into ten different sections with a ton of different levels to play in each group.  I believe anyone looking for a simple, yet challenging puzzle game can easy get several hours of entertainment out of this great app.<br /><br />Sidenote: I have both CrossMe and CrossMe Color.  They're both great but if I had to choose between the two I'd have to give a slight nod to CrossMe Color for the obvious reason that the pictures you get to make are a little more exciting.

B008FOB124|1.0|I really wanted to like this album. But as has already been stated, this is more a Perry work than a DCD one. Gerrard has one of the best, most haunting voices ever, but she's barely evident in this \\"collaboration,\\" except presumably in the music. And there isn't much range in the latter from song to song. There's not single sing that I'll listen to again. Majorly disappointed in this long-anticipated return. It should be titled \\"stasis.\\"

B004OR1XGK|5.0|I'm a electrical engineering and computer science (soon to be graduated) student and this book was recommended to me by a friend who works as a sysadmin.<br /><br />I have always faced problems with programs conception : how can it be designed to be more understandable and easy to be read ? What and where can I optimised it ? Is there methods or things that I should be aware ?<br /><br />This book is so... COMPLETE! There is everything that all people who have to program should know and be aware of! Especially if you're not a programmer, you should have it in your library (or Calibre ;-)). Everything is very clear and necessary. You learn how to code beyond a language, it's really helpful and I don't know why it's not the first book that professors have asked us to read! It would have been so helpful to develop the right coding habit during my school project. I'm looking forward to tackle future project now.

B0050DIWFC|1.0|First, I want to say that there were some things that did not really bother me about this book.  I am a lawyer, but nitpicks having to do with legal procedure, etc, are not the reason I am giving this book a bad review.  I also do not really care how long someone sits shiva or whatever.  My problem with this book was that the characters were horribly underdeveloped, and a story like this must have strong characters in order to succeed.<br /><br />The basic plot of this book is that an assistant D.A's 14 year-old son has been accused of murdering a classmate.  That's it.  No really, that is basically the entire plot.  There are some things regarding the narrator's father, and a family history of violence, but the plot does not expand very much beyond that one line.  It is so simple it could be a one hour Law and Order episode.  Now I want to make something clear: I do not think a story has to have a complicated plot in order to be interesting.  ANY story can be interesting.  It is all in how the author chooses to tell it.  But when a plot is really simple, then it is really important that you have characters you care about.  The characters in this book are REALLY underdeveloped.  The wife, Laurie, does not even seem like a real person, and neither does the son, Jacob.  I will not give away any spoilers, but understanding WHO Laurie is, is really important.  The narrator has been with this woman since she was 17, yet somehow they interact like they are virtual strangers, and I do not think that was INTENTIONAL on the author's part. About halfway through the book it occurred to me that I did not care about any of the characters at all.  In fact the one character who was sort of interesting, was sitting in prison the entire book.  There were also characters and scenes in the novel that were just sort of \\"there\\" and seemed to have almost nothing to do with the story.<br /><br />I want to mention something else this book lacks that made it poor.  I am talking about MOOD.A crime book, especially a murder mystery, really should have a certain mood to it.  This story takes place in a town outside of Boston.  Hey, guess what, I have never been to Boston or any towns near Boston.  That means the author needs to take me there.  What do these people eat?  What kind of houses do they live in?  Are they all wine drinkers, or are they beer drinkers? What does it mean to live there? A novel's setting is important.  It is sort of one more character; when you understand it, you can understand the people in the story a little better.  For example, Tana French does an excellent job of taking you to Dublin in all her novels.  Why?  Well, the fact that the story takes place in Ireland actually MATTERS in her stories, as well it should.<br /><br />In summary, a total lack of caring about the characters in this novel made it very dull.  To me, a great book leaves you will a certain sense of sadness when you finish it.  You are sad because you do not want to part with the people in the story.  This book never made me feel like any of the characters were actual people at all.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it was that good! My husband normally glazes over when I tell him book plots but when I explained the plot for this book his words \\"that would make a great movie\\". I could not put it down!

1423113454|5.0|So, okay. There were the Greek gods from the \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\\", roman gods from \\"The Heroes of Olympus\\", and now, here comes a brand-new god-related series of Rick Riordan: \\"The Kane Chronicles\\".<br /><br />Like the other series, this one is about the ancient god that has been influencing our culture for a long time, always was behind-the-scenes, and had some powerful beings under control, and was the blame for most of unnatural shenanigans.<br /><br />However, to be a little different from the Olympians, this set of gods coming to story in the book is Egyptians, and their world is literally a \\"whole new world\\" for our Riodan fans. First big difference: storytelling. Riodan actually wrote the first book in a diary format of the Kane siblings, taking turns in describing their POV in the events mentioned in the book. I actually saw something like this coming, after the triologic storytelling of \\"The Heroes of Olympus\\" (each chapter taking turns with different main character), but in a diary format? That is not that frequent and like our author. But, I am not complaining! It was totally awesome to be exposed to the two sides of the story and to have some interruptions from reality with some ingenious comments like \\"don't look at me like that! It was true\\".<br /><br />Anyway, I give this a 5 out of 5 since I was really excited about this new series, and judging from the first book, I think it will do amazingly./ although, I have to wonder...... what culture's gods will be on the next series of god storys?
B008COII1Y|1.0|I like Zombie movies as much as the next person but this was painfully slooow. There is minimal to none in the zombie killing and Zombie attacks. The only thing good was the picture on the box.
0142000655|5.0|It is a sweeping story, covering the time period between the civil war and the First World War, and from Connecticut to California. It's interesting that Steinbeck himself is in the novel, and the Hamiltons, his mother's family, takes up half of the book. I wonder what is real and what is not, though everything except the twin's mother seems real. For example Steinbeck's mother's plane ride - was that a made-up story? Or is at least a part of it true? Could there be a real person like Cathy?<br /><br />It's a great book and I'll probably read again several years down the road.
B008NA3HZ4|3.0|Usually the films that HDNet Movies pick to sneak preview on its channel the Wednesday before it opens in (limited) theatrical release is of dubious entertainment value at best and complete trash at worst.

B008Z9YLV2|2.0|I spend much of the movie thinking about how badly it was cast.

B0067EKY7M|2.0|I love Emily Blunt.  I think I'd pay to watch a movie where she did nothing but read from a newspaper.  I also think Yemen is a fascinating --albeit in a terrible way-- country.  So I was eager to see this movie that is billed more or less as a breezy romantic comedy set in Yemen.<br /><br />The movie's basic plotting is pretty predictable with Emily Blunt's character worrying over the fate of her soldier boyfriend who is missing in action and slowly falling in love with Ewan McGregor.  But I could put up with a movie like that being predictable as long as it is cute and appealing.<br /><br />But my ability to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the story can't stand up to my knowledge that no one in the modern era would ever consider introducing salmon and the sport of salmon fishing into Yemen, a country:<br /><br />-that suffers from a horrific shortage of water<br />-is beset by terrible poverty that would make the idea of outlaying millions and millions of dollars for such a project almost obscene<br />-is beset by ongoing political turmoil over who will get to rule Yemen ever since the long-serving dictator (er...I mean president...departed from the scene).<br />-is host to the most virulent and vibrant affiliate of al-Qa'ida in the world<br />-also has a slow burning insurgency involving the Houthi tribesmen (Shi'as who hate and are hated by the Sunnis of the country)<br />-that has serious problems over southerners still angry over the forced merger of Yemen over 20 years ago<br /><br />Another telltale about how implausible this movie is where it was filmed. It was not anywhere near Yemen but in Morocco.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I read about the novel that this film is based on...that it's satirical account of the salmon fishing project.  If the movie had played it like a story out of the Onion, I think \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" would have been a good movie.  But playing it as a gentle, pleasant romantic comedy just doesn't work because Yemen is such a disaster area.  It seems almost in bad taste to set such a story there...the same way a light-hearted romantic comedy in Nazi-occupied Poland would be.<br /><br />So my advice is that it should only be watched if you are a die-hard Emily Blunt fan and you're either ignorant of the reality of Yemen or are somehow able to ignore that reality.aster area.

1607105489|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.<br /><br />But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.<br /><br />Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.<br /><br />But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.<br /><br />Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave.c novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave.

1454901330|4.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight.with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles.

B00000DR5I|5.0|Rolling Stone magazine dismissively called this record  \\"25th Century lounge schmaltz\\"...but then again, that renowned magazine savaged just about every now-classic band or act save for Van Morrison and Neil Young, who were given a lifetime pass to pass gas into an empty coffee can and still receive accolades from their reviewers. As for Tangerine Dream, well, listening to this album 30-plus years on, I realize I love it even more than \\"Phaedra\\", which blew me away, and it ranks among TD's very best. \\"Rubycon\\" is lush and swirling, pulsing, ghostly and dreamy, creative and evocative. Just lie back in the moonlight, sip a good libation, and listen to it with headphones. Pure sonic artistry...the Froese-Franke-Baumann triumvirate at its very best.
B004GJNFHG|4.0|I think Steve McQueen has to be one of the most interesting directors working right now. I loved Shame, which was so multi-layered I think you could teach a class on it. Hunger was similarly well put together. I liked the structure - the first and last parts had minimal dialogue, while the middle had this dynamic discussion between Bobby Sands and his local priest. Book-ending this brilliant discussion with near silence was a clever move.<br />One scene that struck me particularly was of a guard cleaning up the prisoners' urine in the hallway - the prisoners would use their leftover food to make \\"waterways\\" to guide their urine out under their doors at the same time to make a mess in the hall. There's a long, silent scene of the guard first splashing disinfectant (presumably) over the puddles, then, starting at the far end of the hallway, push-brooming the mess down the hall, sometimes pushing it under the prisoners' doors, then all the way down the hall. It was a scene that required patient viewing, but in retrospect, it made me think about how that was one of the few ways the inmates could protest, and yet how useless it was, as if their very voices were simply being shoved back at them or tossed down a drain. And yet despite the futility, they kept working in unison to protest. It was also another instance of using food, the very stuff of life itself, as a means of rebellion.<br />I doubt there are many other actors with enough talent too pull of the role of Bobby Sands as powerfully as Michael Fassbender, who manages to be riveting despite, or even perhaps because of, a lack of dialogue.<br />One minor issue is that film assumes you know what was going on politically at this time. I don't have a lot of knowledge of that unsettled period, but even so, I was able to appreciate the situation. Not quite as stunning as Shame, but very much worth watching. View it when you have a quiet couple of hours, because it's going to draw you in and hold you. I can't wait to see what Steve McQueen does next, and I hope he continues to work with Michael Fassbender.

B009329ZF2|3.0|It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but very forgettable. The best part was that the alien bombs looked like the pegs from the Battleship game. Other than that, full of holes, cliches, and bad acting. On the upside, plenty of action. And finally, an alien movie where the aliens don't have tentacles! Gotta give it props for that.

0805095535|3.0|Paul Auster's Winter Journal is written in the second person and as a result, I found it difficult to read. This was unfortunate for me because Auster is a writer whose work I always wish I enjoyed more. I found his memories of and the description of his mother's death the most moving part of the book. As we boomers age, it's great to have books that help us sum up our lives and for many readers, Auster's book will be a touching and perceptive book about aging and loss. But I do wish it was written in the first person.
B0072IVGZG|2.0|... where most of us walk numbly through a chaotic and ever increasingly life, with endless cheap sensory overload, little knowledge of what is real or quality. It is not as typical as many other albums you'd hear, but it is more writing that attempts to be interesting. Not inspired or fresh - perhaps a 3 out of a 10 on that scale.<br /><br />I did like how they did a lot of moody slower songs, and even some of the faster ones sound like that - like Siberia from the deluxe version. Ofcourse most of them including Life death is uninspired.<br /><br />And to make things worse there's a disgusting U2 influence that can be heard in quite a few places mainly in Ian's singing.

0439023491|3.0|know before I had said that I was never going to read this book, mainly because I just couldn't see what they intended to do after the first, and I still stand by it, so it came to no surprise when there was another Hunger Games in the second book just with a twist.<br /><br />I neither disliked nor was I completely gaga over the second book. Perhaps it was the med's or perhaps it is just that I have such a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of the book.<br /><br />It actually felt a little rushed to me, where as before the first in the series seemed to run smoothly with all the right amount of drama and action, this one felt as if I was on fast foreword constantly, with only snip it's of pause to where I could catch enough information to gather what was going on but not become emerged in the tale.<br /><br />I didn't have a favorite in this book because unlike last time I didn't really get a connection to any of the character's.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I enjoyed the book, the movie was too pretty.<br /><br />Even though the inhabitants of impoverished district 12 look like WWII refugees and wear frumpy frocks, Katniss sports a to die for outfit -- well-fitted leather jacket plus those marvelous boots -- while hunting a deer. No way would she ever gut a deer in that outfit! This implausibility made me laugh out loud and took me out of the movie at the very beginning instead of gaining my interest. And the laughs just continued...<br /><br />Sorry guys, but I got tired of close-ups of Katniss. The irony is that this vain fashion magazine approach is contrary to the theme of the book. How did Hollywood not get it? (Sarcasm, folks.)<br /><br />The characters lack depth, the ending lacks closure, the scenes are mere snippets, the romance is cold, special effects border on cheesy, yet it's mildly entertaining. For some reason, I liked seeing W. Harrelson and L Kravitz in their roles.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|The way the movie portrayed quadriplegia really moved me. I work with quadriplegics, and the the actor playing Phillipe was phenomenal; especially in the scene when Driss transferred him to the chair. I laughed so hard because that happened to me once. Fell right over and never said he was falling. LOL. I loved the story line. Driss learned quickly that he needed to become an extension of another person. It is so hard to adapt. I felt like a puppet at first. I could see in fleeting moments, Driss attempting to cope.<br /><br />The scene when Phillipe was having respiratory problems was the first time Driss realized his nurturing abilities. That was the most tender moment in the whole movie. There is so much merit to this movie, and I don't wish to divulge any spoilers. Go see it. If you don't see a tear or two from your date, dump them! <gr>.

0374275637|5.0|This book illustrates how Kahnneman challenged the established view, of how decisions are made.<br /> His insight in psychology, plus years of work, examining past decisions and comparing the expected result, with what actaually occured, shows how decisons, can be affected by emotions,or if a more deliberate approach is used, the result is likely to be more logical.<br />The use of many examples, which ask the reader to make decisions or choices, allows the reader to take part in the decision making process. The book is an easy read, but at times, some paragraphs or pages will need to be readdressed, to ensure full comprehension and enjoyment.<br />Anyone contemplating a degree in economics, must read this book.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|This book was inspired by a Mongolian documentary that explores the idea of reincarnation of dogs as humans. This is interesting. This is novel. This could, potentially, be the premise for a good and interesting book if that's the concept we're diving into. I love dogs, and the idea that my own old dog might be reincarnated as a human is a lovely and interesting one. Reviews on this site and others assured me that this was a book worth reading for a whole multitude of reasons and, as such, I came into this book with high expectations--none of which were met.<br /><br />From the opening pages, readers know this is going to be a sentimental, schmaltzy, overwrought book with some seriously strained metaphors; we open with an image that is, admittedly, heart-rending, but so very contrived that even our dog-narrator knows he's posturing. Ideas in this book are explored to the point of exploitation as we're hit over the head with the ways we can apply racing principles to our daily lives; I lost count of the number of times I was told that you don't win a race in the first turn. Needless to say, the reincarnation bit is utterly overshadowed by this silliness.<br /><br />Enzo, our narrator, is mostly reliable, but I struggled to really get on board with a narrating dog so wise he understands when he's about to be forgotten at home for three days but who can't seem to recognize that he is the one who destroyed a stuffed animal collection (he blames it on a demonic zebra toy in what is easily the book's most ridiculous conceit). And the sheer volume of bad luck Enzo's owner seems to have is pretty unbelievable too.<br /><br />Overall, the plot is overwrought and oversimplified. The writing is clunky and never gets off the ground. The magical ending is flat-out absurdity. Woof.

B0015AARJI|1.0|I bought this from limmited distributions and fulfilled by Amazon. The controller I got was fake and was unusable.  Even though somebody else complained about also getting a fake through this seller, amazon was still helping them sell these fake controllers. Hey amazon when people start complaining about fake merchandise stop selling their products immediately. I have spent thousands of dollars over the years with amazon which means I deserve real genuine products not knockoffs! This is the second time this has happened and one more and its strike 3 and done with amazon. Amazon needs to keep better track of merchants who do this and get rid of them immediately. I don't care how good your discounts are, product reliability comes first.
0743454537|4.0|\\"If you have a sister and she dies, do you stop saying you have one? Or are you always a sister, even when the other half of the equation is gone?\\" This question would run through Anna Fitzgerald's mind at least once everyday as she watched her sister, Kate, who has been diagnosed with leukemia since age two, suffer in the hospital. However, it is not just Kate that has to undergo all the pain, because Anna would be in the bed next to her having undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so she could save Kate's life by being a personal donor machine. After all, she was engineered that way.<br /><br />My Sister's Keeper is by far one of my personal favorites because the author, Jodi Picoult conveys through her story the question of life's worth, rebellious natures of a teenager, and the overbearing love of a parent. The story is about a family of five that has three children. The third and youngest, Anna, was engineered in the womb to be the perfect donor for her older sister, Kate, who has leukemia. How would you feel if you knew the only reason for your existence was to save someone else's? \\"It's about a girl who is on the cusp of becoming someone...A girl who may not know what she wants right now, and she may not know who she is right now, but who deserves to find out.\\" Anna has a real hard time figuring out who she is because she does not see her life's worth without being combined with her sister. Anna begins to find out who she is by breaking away from being her sister's personal donor machine. She sues her mother, Sarah, for the rights to her own body by saying she will not be Kate's donor anymore. Jesse, the oldest child, suffers from a lack of attention from his parents, and he desperately tries to get their attention by doing illegal activities. This story is about how a family copes when a family member becomes diagnosed with cancer, one of the world's deadliest diseases.<br /><br />This book is told from different viewpoints, which really allows the reader to sympathize with certain characters. However, not all the characters are likeable and easy to connect with, like the mother, Sarah. She comes off as a pushy woman who seems to revolve all of the family's life on the sick child, Kate. The main issue this book addresses is if the liability of someone's life should rest in the hand of a minor patient. The other question that arises is whether the parents know what is best for their child, or should minors have a voice in their medical decisions. Another issue that Picoult touches upon is the shaky line between what is right and wrong regarding medical issues, the strength of sisterhood and family, and reasons why some people remain secretive about certain matters.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book because not only did it show me the amount of love a parent can offer to their child, but it also educated me on medical terms related to Kate's case of leukemia. Learning about this book's existence a couple years ago, I was not too excited reading it for my summer reading. I opened the book with complete disinterest, but after the first page I was completely engrossed in it. I could not put the book down until I finished. Filled with tragedy, family drama, and a big twist at the end that no one can predict, I had cried through quite a few tissues. It is not easy for me to cry, so I was really surprised when the novel touched me the way it did. When reading this book, be prepared with a whole box of tissues. You're going to need it, trust me. My Sister's Keeper is an amazing read that will touch the reader to the bottom of their hearts. This book is worth buying and keeping on a bookshelf. It is a novel that can be read over and over again, and the reader will encounter the same overwhelming emotions every single time.

0800141660|5.0|Of all the movies I have seen about Sense and Sensibility this is by far the best!!  Emma Thompson did a superb job of writing the screenplay.  She followed Jane Austen's book almost as it was written.  She even included the third child which all other screen players did not.  I do not know why some screen players think their script is better then the author's story, but they do.  Buy the movie.

Yes, especially if you are someone who plays videogames, grew up in the 80's, or generally consider yourself a nerd/geek.
0446572993|1.0|The publishers review of the book had promise and at first the few poorly researched facts didn't bother me too much.  However after a few laugh out loud moments, i had to quit. The author obviously has never see a military Service Record Book (SRB)from the Gulf War, talked to someone in the Infantry, talked to a covert armored car manufacturer, researched ballistics, or googled the make up of an Infantry Squad.  Seriously he didn't even care enough to find out how many people make up an infantry squad.  His take on drugs in the military was way off and his use of the term \\"Army Squad\\" was in the wrong context.

Finally, she has an engaging style of writing - it's science with a sense of humor. This is one of the most useful books I have read.

B0000028RR|1.0|hi !<br />My experience was not very good as they arrive and drive out of the package, it looked in perfect condition, factory sealed with seals in good condition, but when removing the packaging we realized that the music CD did not come into it . Not if it's a factory fault or have been involved in the shipment, but I really do not know what to do or what procedure to follow, but I would get my order as I requested.<br />Comments and suggestions would be appreciated.<br />thanks<br />Geraldine Santos.

B005LAIHSQ|1.0|I thought 'Hey, the guy who plays Thor is in it... maybe it will be good.' But I was wrong, this movie had such a big budget and does not deserve any of the money it makes back. The only watchable character is the guy from Thor, then rest of the actors almost didnt need to even be there. Someone could have filmed the queens character pacing the halls of her castle for two hours and the movie would have made just as much sense. Save your money and buy something that is actually quality, and not just a bunch of odds and ends of special effects thrown together. This movie gets two thumbs jammed into my eyes so that I never have to see this crap again.

B007SGM084|3.0|I purchased the trilogy for my Kindle.<br /><br />With the comparisons to the Twilight series (sans eroticism), I wasn't expecting the best written novel. But the writing quality and dialogue was better than Twilight. I did not enjoy the fact that every chapter was another excuse to write an erotic encounter. Again - that seemed to be the purpose of the book, more so than the story line.  And, guess what, the story line is not, actually, that bad.  It was a quick and easy read.  I read all three over the course of a long weekend.  If the couple's \\"adventures\\" were too much and unrealistic, I skimmed the passage.  It was not exactly what I expected, but it wasn't that bad.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|I read the reviews before buying, and decided to try these durable cards. Wow! Really durable! No worries about grimy little hands, tearing or even folding. This deck should last forever.<br /><br />The downside is the laminated plastic is so slippery that it's hard to shuffle. The deck is a lot thicker than regular so the bone pile tends to slide all over.  We use a soap bar travel box to keep them stacked better.<br /><br />The game itself is different from what I remember playing in the 60's, but it's easy to learn the new stuff. Good classic game to teach basic arithmetic without it being boring.
1554072840|1.0|Now that the author has made her millions, let me go ahead and tell you why this book sucks.<br />***Spoilers alert***<br />The story doesn't even start until you're ten pages in after several blank pages, title page, publisher's info and an introductory letter explaining the choice of euphemisms. Why? It's a kids' book. Why all the padding? My daughter is looking at me like \\"what are you skipping? why aren't you reading?\\"<br />Ok, let's do this. You get a page introducing the oddly named character, then a couple pages introducing her body parts. Then an awkwardly worded and ineffectively drawn demonstration of what a diaper change is. Grandma shows up with a giant teacup or gravy server or whatever the hell that's supposed to be. Chamber pot? I don't know I'd have to go get my monocle on to be sure since no one has seen one since the Taft administration. The next several pages, the bulk of the book I might add, are spent explaining all the things that the oddly shaped \\"potty\\" is not. Awesome, the entire book is a derailment because of an incomprehensible aesthetic decision. Shouldn't we be talking more about how you know it's time to go, and what to do when that happens? Back to the story. Prudence shoots and misses. Mom changes her diaper again. Then there's a page of the words \\"and sat\\" copy/pasted so many times that no adult has ever read them because reading the same words that many times makes the words lose meaning. Then she shoots and scores. They dump the poop, and then on the next page she supposedly washes her hands but they show Prudence standing next to the toilet with no sink in sight. (My daughter thinks you wash your hands in the toilet now. Thanks.) Prudence's mother says Prudence will use her potty every time. Then a couple pages of author bio. Why?<br />All said I'm guessing at least half this book's pages are padding. The diaper change page needs to be completely redrawn/rewritten. The potty needs to look like a potty. Maybe even LIKE THE ONE THEY SELL WITH THE DOLL THAT GOES WITH THE BOOK. Prudence's mother seems like she's barely containing a frustration explosion, as she only appears to tell us how many diapers she has to change. What this book does well, it does in about 4 pages, the rest is neither informative nor helpful. Sorry to be so harsh, but with all the glowing and sentimental reviews, I figured I'd chime in with my less than stellar impressions.<br />I'm off to find a potty book with useful information and modern plumbing.Y SELL WITH THE DOLL THAT GOES WITH THE BOOK.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|When Rose has a vision of herself dead, she's more than stunned. She realizes she hasn't actually lived life, but has simply trudged through each day. She's determined to change this and creates her own \\"bucket list\\" on the back of a receipt. All thoughts are set aside, when she arrives home and finds her mother dead, murdered on the living room couch. She's more than ever determined to accomplish her wish list, especially since she seems to be the prime suspect in the murder. Reading about Rose's approach to accomplishing her list, with the able and enthusiastic assistance of her new neighbor, Joe, is an entertaining read, combining romance, suspense and more murder. I found myself shaking my head one minute, laughing out loud the next.
B002ZCLH5S|1.0|Boring. This feels like a made-for-TV-movie. My wife and I watched it with our 12 and 10 year old boys. All of us were astonished at the absurdity. The whole alien sequence is beyond belief. They go for silly and cute, but it's just plain ridiculous. Despite this silliness angle, they also make an attempt at some kind of \\"message\\" which only made it worse. The sequence was also stretched out to three times the length it needed to be. In fact, many scenes drag on well beyond their expiration date. Maybe younger kids would like it (under 8), but even they might lose interest.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is a great way for me to just space out and kill time with out needing to think too much. Yes, you can exit the game without restarting your Kindle. Go to Stuff, then Options. As for the parents that say the game is a scam that &quot;tricks&quot; kids in to spending real money, don't blame the developers, blame yourself for giving your kids your device without turning off in app purchasing and adding a password for extra protection. Apps are never truely free. There are always either ads, which in this game there are not, or ad-ons that you can buy if you are not patient enough to wait to earn these things through game play, like in this game. I have most of the families and &quot;fun&quot; things and have earned them, not bought them. People seem to forget that developing games is a job and that people work to earn money. Oh, and for the reviewer that said the game is obnoxious because he was addicted to it and had to check in frequently, again, don't blame the developer. Yes, your families will leave if not fed every 3days or so but the same concept applies to most games that are what I consider to be &quot;care taking&quot; games. In farmville your crops die after only a few hours and there is no way of recovering them unlike in this game. I only check in once a day or two unless I have an egg to hatch.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it recently has stopped allowing me to visit friends. Fix this issue and I will change it to 5 stars.

0525478817|4.0|So I have two options. One, remove my reading glasses every time I need to wipe the tears from my eyes; or two, hold the book far enough away so I can read without my glasses and wipe my eyes as I read. I choose the latter, since the third option (stop reading altogether) isn't really an option at all. If you read Young Adult-type books I am sure you have heard of this book. It's been everywhere, including the number one spot on the New York Times Bestseller List. There's nothing I can say about it that hasn't already been said. But since I'm here, writing, and since you're there, reading, what the heck.<br /><br />Hazel, 16, meets Augustus,17, in a cancer support group for kids. He's only there to support his friend, Isaac, who has lost an eye to cancer. Hazel wasn't supposed to be there, meaning, she wasn't supposed to make it this far. Three years into her battle, she's holding steady. Despite her ruined lungs, traveling oxygen tank, hovering parents and lack of a life of a normal teenager, she's one of the \\"lucky\\" ones. Augustus knows exactly how she's feeling, since he, too, is a lucky one, except for the missing leg. But he's been clear for a while, and gives Hazel a focus that she desperately needs. He's been there, yet he refuses to stay there. For you can't be \\"normal\\" ever again. People either keep you at an arm's length because they can't relate or they pity you. Neither are comfortable places to be.<br /><br />In one of those moments of honesty, Hazel tries to explain her feelings to her mom, who thinks that she's depressed and needs to get out more:<br /><br />\\"I'm a grenade and at some point I'm going to blow up and I would like to minimize the casualties, okay?\\"...\\"I'm a grenade,\\" I said again. \\"I just want to stay away from people and read books and think and be with you guys because there's nothing I can do about hurting you; you're too invested, so just please let me do that, okay? I'm not depressed. I don't need to get out more. And I can't be a regular teenager, because I am a grenade.\\"<br /><br />Augustus lives his life like there's literally no tomorrow. Even though his type of cancer has an 85% rate of recovery, he's prepared for death since his first diagnosis. He has the suit, he's chosen his plot. So all that's left to do is go to school and be the center of the universe for his friends. His sense of humor, his unflinching views and his love for Hazel are what keeps everyone going. How many cancer survivors do you know that like to taunt death by dangling an unlit cigarette between their teeth or help their blind friend egg an ex-girlfriend's car? How many would share their \\"wish\\" with a girlfriend who has already used hers to travel to Disney World (\\"Hazel GRACE!\\" He shouted. \\"You did not use your one dying Wish to go to Disney World with your parents!\\")?<br /><br />This book, in all of its scary cancer-ness and talk of treatments, lost body parts, lost children, and lost control is ultimately about moving on. From cancer itself, whether through death or remission. From illness being the central focus of one's life (or entire family's life). From friends, both former and stricken. It's about people telling you that it's okay that you're a grenade and they would rather feel the unholy force of your explosion than never feel your love or touch or presence. Because, ultimately, people will be people, we should allow them to be so, and we should let in those who think they can handle an untimely end and love those who can't. It is still a tragedy, especially my looking through a lens of advanced adulthood, knowing the life that they'll miss. But while they are alive, let them carve their niche in their own way and savor life and its \\"normal\\" ups and downs the best they can. Otherwise, it's pretty hypocritical. For how can you justify feeling pity or remorse for someone because they can't live their life and then you don't let them try?<br /><br />For those wondering about the title, it comes from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.

I guess I purchased the wrong book.  I am sure that this book is pretty much the same as the one at work except for the test. I haven't read it but hope to soon. My husband liked it.

038572179X|5.0|The title is ironic.  Briony, the lead character never atones.  She fantasizes about atoning.  She fantasizes about herself fantasizing about atoning.  Astonishingly self-aware in some areas, self-deluding in others, self-centered in all ways.  Briony never atones for her heinous act, because in the end, everything is all about her, and everyone else is a supporting cast member in the play that is her life.<br />The writing is masterful - gorgeous and full of telling detail.  The contents of a tiny office or apartment are described in such a way that the entire history of a character - and their dreams and aspirations - are revealed.<br />The book is also a beautifully imagined meditation on the art of writing, on the author as master puppeteer.<br />Beautifully done!

A must read for sure....

B006AN78XS|3.0|Like the man at the movie`s core, I was hoping to be transported to a different time and place while watching Woody Allen`s universally acclaimed \\"Midnight in Paris.\\"  What I got instead was a sporadically charming but surprisingly earthbound little fantasy that had me pining away over lost opportunities with the Lost Generation.<br /><br />The conceit - not terribly original in and of itself but filled with promise and possibilities - involves an American writer visiting modern-day Paris who is whisked away every midnight to the 1920s where he hobnobs with many of the great writers, artists and thinkers of the time: F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Josephine Baker, Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and others.<br /><br />So far, so good.  Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is portrayed as a hopeless romantic who, as we are too often wont to do, believes that life was better in a time before he was born - an idealized era where life was richer, simpler and somehow more satisfying than it is today.  For Gil, that ideal period is the Paris of the 1920s, which he envisions as a scene of endless literary and intellectual discussions amongst a rarified elite.  He's engaged to Inez (Rachel McAdams), a much more prosaic 21st Century woman, whose father (Kurt Fuller) is a right-wing tea-party type and whose mother (Mimi Kennedy) looks with disdain on her daughter's life choices, including the man she`s picked to marry.  No wonder Gil rushes back every night to that space/time continuum portal that allows him to be with the people he really likes and who seem to like and understand him.<br /><br />The main problem for me with \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is that it is unable to bring its roster of extraordinary historical figures to life.  In fact, they emerge basically as some of the blandest people you are ever likely to meet, this century or last.  They wouldn't even make a good cocktail party crowd.  Not one of them says anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works.  And without that dimension, Gil's trips to the past have all the excitement and authenticity of a dress-up ball that never ends.<br /><br />The scenes set in the present are scarcely any better.  Inez' family and their pompous, know-it-all friend, played by Michael Sheen, are just the Ugly American writ large, and the humor is surprisingly toothless and lacking for a Woody Allen movie.  Wilson, who has been effective in other roles, here feels too much like a stand-in for a younger version of Allen himself to make much of an impression of his own.<br /><br />So what of the glorious views of Paris that one would expect from such a film?  Surely, those are worth the price of admission.  Actually, not really, for the cinematographer, Darius Khonji, has, for some inexplicable reason, seen fit to cast the city in a strangely sickly yellowish glow that robs the place of much of its natural beauty and luster.<br /><br />So what is good about the film?  Well, there are some genuinely tender moments between Gil and Adriana, the on-again/off-again mistress of Pablo Picasso, who suffers from Gil's idealization of the past, only to her, that rosier past lies in the era known as La Belle Epoque.  And there's a very funny in-movie scene in which Gil gives a bemused and befuddled Luis Bunuel the idea for what the surrealist will later turn into \\"The Exterminating Angel.\\"  The movie also does a nice job fleshing out its theme - of the illusion of a Golden Age vs. the reality of a present day - in the final reel.<br /><br />More virtues like these and \\"Midnight in Paris\\" might have been the truly transporting charmer it was meant to be.s anything insightful or witty that would in any way indicate that they are world-famous artists and creators of lasting works.

B000F7CMQ8|3.0|In Africa, a hunter (Clark Gable) has two women come for safari:  One is a worldly,  nightclubbing dame (Ava Gardner) and the other a demure, Bostonian wife (Grace Kelly). Both instantly find the macho man irresistible.<br /><br />I usually like these three stars a lot, but I didn't care much for this movie. Gable's character is a silly caricature of rugged manliness; he growls orders, drinks a lot, and grabs women too roughly. He was only 52, but looked much older and was past his Rhett Butler glory days. Kelly is good but seems to be trying oh-so-hard to be stern and matronly with much lip-pouting and overdoing the accent. Gardner plays her usual sexy, sadder-but-wiser part, but her dialogue is phony and stagy, her character overblown and never believable.<br /><br />While the animal-catching and scenes of marginalized natives are terribly out of fashion and off-putting, the location scenery is beautiful, especially filmed in brilliant Technicolor. With two gorgeous women (inexplicably) fighting over one man, I imagine the movie was quite sensational when it came out in 1953, but now I find it corny and silly.

0451228375|5.0|This book takes place during a less common period for historical fiction (1400s) as does the preceding novel (pillars of the earth) which takes place 200 years earlier. As such, we are given a well researched look into what life was like at that time while also being treated to rich characters and non-stop plot evolution. As a voracious reader, I appreciate the book lasting a bit longer than most and like \\"Pillars\\" it is engrossing. If you like long historical fiction novels, in my humble opinion, this one excels.

B008VBYN80|1.0|i was playing this game or the last week and rather enjoying myself but with these type of games y ou have to buy currency to make any real significant process but that's not why I Gave this one star. I spent a good $30 buying the currency and decided I needed to just make a one time payment for$100. I spent the $100 but never received any like was promises. if you buy this game DO NOT purchase the currency. you will get scamed.

B000RZGIOA|5.0|Not giving a book report summary of the plot or acting critiques here.  Just focusing on the Blu Ray transfer itself.  Should you check on any of my reviews, and I hope that you do, that is what you will get, only a discussion of the quality of the transfer.<br /><br />The video transfer onto Blu Ray, as opposed to the standard def version of Face Off, offers an improvement in both resolution and shadow depth....it is not the best video transfer I have ever seen and there are some scenes that appear soft and perhaps muted via the compression, but never the less, the video transfer to Blu Ray is good.  There aren't any hints of video banding, aliasing or artifacts.  Some snow or grain can be seen if you look for it but it is not very apparent or in any way distracting.<br /><br />The audio is the star of this transfer, tho the audio on the Standard Def version was also good.  You are offered DTS 5.1 or 5.1 EX.  I preferred the DTS audio and, tho it is lossy, the disc is still demo worthy as it will definitely give your audio system a huge workout.  This is a loud movie and, at one point, I had to turn the volume down a touch.  There is excellent use of the discreet channels and panning of effects from front to back and side to side.  Your sub woofer is kicking out the jams producing as much bottom end as your system can handle.  My system is very high end audiophile gear and it was wonderful to hear it put to good use.<br /><br />The extras provide deleted scenes, an alternate ending (which I am glad they didn't use) and a lengthy and comprehensive 'Making of'.  Commentary tracks are included as well as a very interesting bio of John Woo.<br /><br />I have long loved this movie.  As I said, the standard DVD version was not bad at all.  Therefore, the jump to Blu Ray doesn't provide an earth shaking difference but it is still a great BluRay and well worth buying.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksso check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game to play. I like to play it when I am bored. but I like unlocking new games. and I'm really just writing a review for the 250,000 points I get when I finish it.

B003JZT2AW|5.0|[[ASIN:B003JZT2AW Time Flies... 1994-2009]]<br /><br />I ordered the Best of Oasis in its collector edition (3 CDs + 1 DVD). The product was shipped quite quickly; it even arrived before the due date. The CDs, as described, were brand new and worked perfectly. The package was in hard cardboard, so no worries for the shipping. I would buy again with this seller and I definitely recommend it!
B005WGBQ9G|2.0|I feel like the series morphed from horror to drama with gore.  I am disliking the characters more, I feel yucky somehow.  I felt cleaner after watching the resident evil movies. I don't know if I want to see any more now.

0679721037|5.0|A non-biased look at six survivors of the atomic weapon dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The book tells the story of these six survivors from the moments before the bomb, to the lives they had many years later. Probably the best and most well known first person perspective book on the subject.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Highly enjoyable game that doesn't commit the cardinal pay-to-play sin where you must buy everything to enjoy it. Highly recommended, but it can have framerate stutters; I use a Kindle Fire, and it works great for me most of the time, though technical issues are present. A solid 3.5 stars from me.

0385737955|5.0|Despite the countless recommendations I had received for this book since it was published, I decided against reading it until recently for the sole reason that I just wasn't that interested. The plot seemed dull, and I have never been much of a dystopian kind of person. Now, I wonder what the heck I was thinking. As James Dashner would say, holy shuck! The Maze Runner was AMAZING! This book has officially made it up to my top five best reads of the summer; I was completely blown away. I always find it so much more difficult to write reviews for books that I adore than books I despise, mainly because it is so hard for me to express in words just how phenomenal said book is. I seem to have encountered this recurring problem once again with The Maze Runner, but nonetheless, I will attempt to write a review worthy of this fantastic book.<br /><br />I must start off with the plot. Thomas wakes up to find himself in a box that opens up to the glade, the central part of an elaborate maze where monsters dwell. From the moment of Thomas's entrance into the glade, he works to try and recover any part of his memory while also trying to solve the maze and stop the deaths of the boys who live in the Maze with him. It seems as if dystopian books nowadays are sort of merging together; essentially, they all follow the same storyline. Dashner brings something completely different and new to the table with this book. Kids purposefully being trapped in a maze and subjected to countless atrocities for the sake of all of humanity? This idea is so unique and overwhelming; it is completely unfathomable to me how Dashner could come up with a plot idea so new and execute it flawlessly. The plot is very intense and suspenseful, and (much to my delight) eliminates the romantic aspect so many popular dystopians feel the need to include (yes I'm looking at you, Michael Grant). Not that I have anything against a good ole' romance once in a while- I just feel that (unless done very very well) romance is completely out of place in a dystopian novel. I could go on for hours on this topic, but this is a review on The Maze Runner- not a rant on the many faults of dystopian romances.<br /><br />Now onto my next favorite part of this book: the pacing. I love how we were kept in the dark along with Thomas. Right from the start, I was utterly bewildered and disoriented- I had no idea what was going on. I could almost taste the frustration radiating off of Thomas; Dashner purposely keeps us confused to build suspense. Some think it's tedious and slow, but personally, I say it's genius. The apprehension leaves readers squirming in their seats, flipping pages frantically, dying to know what's coming. But all the frustration and blind reading was well worth it, for when Dashner finally tells us what is happening I am utterly flabbergasted. Can you say plot twist? From there the whole story picks up speed. Everything is explained, I am no longer confused and Dashner has moved onto the action! The pacing is done perfectly; a slow introduction, slowly picking up pace and then BAM! Non-stop action from then on out. I love it.<br /><br />I fell in love with the characters. Dashner has created the perfect mix here. You've got the gruff and opinionated Alby, the sweet and naive Chuck, the hard-working and determined hero Thomas, the beautiful and smart Teresa, the strong and hilarious Minho, the likeable second-in-command Newt, and the closest you can get to a secondary antagonist: Gally. There wasn't a single character that really stood out for me with this book; I just loved all of them all as a whole. They are introduced to us and crafted so perfectly throughout the novel. By the end, they have all grown and developed so much- most become very three dimensional for me. I say \\"most\\" here for a reason. One character who I liked, but wished could have been developed a bit more was Teresa. I didn't feel that I got to know here very well (seeing as she was in a coma for most ofthe book). I had hoped Dashner could focus on her role in the plot a bit more in the last little section of the novel, but much to my chagrin, this wasn't the case. I only hope this issue will be cleared up in the next instalment of this series.<br /><br />As for the writing, this is one of those times you either hate it or you love it. I have to say, for this book, I'm on team \\"love it\\"! Dashner includes quite a few made up slang words, sometimes in place of swear words. For example, \\"holy shuck\\", \\"go take a klunk\\", \\"shank\\", \\"good that\\", etc, etc. The list goes on and on. Originally, I hated this aspect of the writing. It seemed hokey and out of place for me. However, as the story progresses, these words seem to just flow from the tongue, as if they were part of normal vocabulary. I get used to the idea of these strange words and I learn what each means. As a result, the new words lose their irritating side and begin to seem cute and downright hilarious. You can't help but laugh when adorable little Chuck tells Thomas to \\"go take a klunk\\" (klunk being the made up word for poo) or when Thomas unknowingly calls the big boss Alby \\"shank\\" (shank being the made up word for newbie). These words popping up everywhere prevent the writing from being poetic or beautiful, but the book is undeniably well written. Dashner definitely has a way with words; he is extremely descriptive and his story just comes alive in my mind.<br /><br />One last note: the ending. Wow! Dashner sure knows how to end off a book! One of the most suspenseful cliffhangers I have ever read about. I was completely satisfied, but somehow desperate to read the next book.<br /><br />I set in to this book with high expectations, and James Dashner delivered. I am very pleased with this novel. The plot was unique, the characters were relatable, the pacing was flawless, the writing was good and the ending was the perfect way to tie everything together. I would recommend it to those who enjoy dystopians and suspenseful novels. Overall, a fabulous novel. Now I must get my hands on the Scorch Trials! Can't wait!
B007Z9QS5K|3.0|I suppose this movie may be good background for having friends over, when you can talk over the movie and not really feel you missed too much.  You get the feeling you are people watching more than sucked into the plot or characters.  I did feel like the movie is propaganda for \\"experiencing your life\\".  Somehow it failed me, but I appreciated the effort.
B0034G4P26|3.0|Fun film . Saw this at the movies and totally loved it . This will look great at home in Blu Ray . Why the 3 star ? Because yet again i fail to see the sense of the film companies . I want to buy this in Blu Ray . I have a Blu Ray player and a nice big TV at home . Why in Gods name would i want a DVD version as well ? I don't want a digital version either . So i'm afraid i wont be buying this until they release a single Blu Ray edition .<br /><br />As a further update to this annoyance ...... why is this available in the UK ( sadly as region 2 ) as a single Blu Ray disc edition but not here in the USA ?
080701429X|5.0|I had to read the first half of this book for a college class (\\"Great Human Questions\\"), but I continued the book to its end because I was amazed by Frankl's life, thoughts, and insights. Although a psychiatrist, much of his method of helping patients came from existential philosophy rather than abstract psychological theories.<br /><br />The first half of the book details how he came to write the book through witnessing events in various Nazi concentration camps, and how he felt he survived when others didn't because he had found a reason for living while others had given up. The second half of the book discusses and tries to explain his theory of logotherapy, which I am still not sure I understand.<br /><br />Man's Search for Meaning is probably a book I will read over and over again throughout my life.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|It was a very interesting book that I completely loved! The ebook part was great because the hardcovers are really big and klunky to carry around so it was much easier when traveling. Great buy. I would reccommend it to any kid who likes adventure.
0553801473|2.0|This book was such a let down for me.  Especially since the first 3 were great and fun to read. The last book was so long and boring.  I wish I would have read Macaroni's review first.  Would have saved me a lot of time. Hopefully the book(s) that follow will be better.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|How far would you go to accomplish your goals?  Not a movie for the easily nauseated.  I must say it is interesting to see Jackman, Bowie, and Bale in a \\"historical\\" piece like this, so this movie's asset is mostly how unusual it is.  If you are bored stiff with regular drama movie fare try this, but beware how it may haunt the dark corners of your psyche. I give it four star's because of the freak factor.

0451155807|5.0|As always, the book was mesmerizing as I was taken on a journey of discovery: discovery of the depths of our planetary solar system, and discovery as who we are as beings occupying our tiny corner of universe.<br /><br />Clarke is true to his philosophy of human evolution and cosmic formation, and he brilliantly intertwines those philosophies to produce a tale that has stood the test of time, and shall do so for many many years to come.<br /><br />I don't personally share Clarke's philosophies, but I do share his probing curiosity into what it is that has brought us here to this point in our individual journeys through time and space.<br /><br />I love Clarke's mastery of the English language and his ability to paint wonderfully telling and powerful images with the written word. As much as I enjoy the movie based on this opus, I almost prefer to spend the time re-reading the printed word.<br /><br />As many times as I've read this book, I still struggle with the final section. In contrast to the length and breadth of the material that precedes it, the final section is short, compact, scattered in thought, busy description and ends much too abruptly. I don't fully understand what Clarke is truly getting at in his ending; do I understand at all?<br /><br />Clarke was truly a visionary. Time and again he includes technological advances within his work that inevitably come to fruition in the not so distant future. This is the first time I've read this book since the advent of the eReader  and the tablet , and am amazed as the just how integral to daily life that technology has become - a shared element of the daily life contained within the book.<br /><br />I give this book a 5 star (+) rating on the following scale:<br />+ poor read<br />++ so-so read<br />+++ good read<br />++++ excellent read<br />+++++ life changing read
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I loved CalenGoo for use on my Kindle Fire so much that I purchased it a second time for use on my new smart phone.  It works as flawlessly as others have stated.  It is super easy to use--very intuitive and miniscule learning curve.  The displays are big, easy to read, and pleasing to the eye.  I can change things in dates in the past (it gives me a warning that the event is passed), which I use as a log or journal.  Very very satisfied.  Well worth the small investment.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game or should I say games is really fun but the games are too expensive but its still a good game
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|the game is loads of fun with many features to try out. you can enjoy the whole game without burning a hole in your wallet like with other games. the more you play the more coins you earn the more features you can enjoy. its a great 5 minute game for when you're bored at work or on the commute. id recommend it to anyone.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought one of these after several pacifier clips and this was hands-down the best option. My son loves to cuddle with his wubbanub while he takes his bottle, often placing it over his eyes as he falls asleep (he is now 10 months.) I think it'll be nice when we take away the paci too as he will still have the stuffed animal to cuddle with (after clipping off the paci.) We now have 4 different wubbanubs and love them all.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was never one of those Constant Readers who avidly read Stephen King for the blood and gore or to be scared witless, although I have been so scared from time to time (the most frightening book I ever read was \\"Misery\\", a book completely without any supernatural or phantasmagorical elements). Mr. King suffers from being typecast as a horror writer and he has done much to encourage that buttonholing himself. However, even those who favor violent bloodletting will have to admit that Mr. King is at the top of their list because HE'S A DAMN GOOD WRITER.<br /><br />In his afterword to \\"Wizard And Glass,\\" Mr. King expressed being daunted about writing a love story -- he needn't have fretted. There isn't an aspect of literature that he does not dominate and \\"11/22/63\\" is a tour de force worthy of any Constant Reader's devotion. His talent for creating protagonists is so well developed that one is casting the movie in one's mind before the story is told. \\"11/22/63\\" bears witness to this in spades. Like Jake, I'm not a weepy guy. Nonetheless, I felt my eyes overflowing several times toward the denouement of this novel. Mr. King has imbued his characters, including Lee Oswald, with a realistic, quite credible humanity which compels the reader to sympathy or contempt: one does not remain indifferent to any of them.<br /><br />Character development is not the only fundamental that Mr. King has mastered. The plot has plenty of depth, action, color and pace. The settings are so well depicted as to leave nothing to the imagination. Some may kvetch about the length of this tome, but this one found himself wanting even more when he arrived at the end. I enjoy feeling like I'm a fly on the wall and taking in every meticulously crafted detail. Others complain about predictability; for my part, I find roller coasters predictable, but I enjoy the ride so much that I take it over and over. Mr. King could have designed great coasters in another career choice.<br /><br />The best fiction distinguishes itself by making the reader feel what the characters are experiencing, by taking you so deep into their world that one forgets his own. Mr. King does one better by taking a portion of our past and casting us into an alternate vision that is at once plausible and preternatural. If you want a slow ride through a discretionary reality, climb into \\"11/22/63\\" and fasten your seatbelt (yes, you'll need one even at this jaunt's deliberate pace).<br /><br />BTW, Mr. King, Jake is disappointingly wrong when he says that history repeats itself. As an English teacher, he should be intimately familiar with the works of Samuel Clemens who famously said, \\"History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\\"distinguishes itself by making the reader feel what the characters are experiencing, by taking you so deep into their world that one forgets his own.

B006O7XOOW|3.0|I put this to the test with my 9 month old twins.  They found it modestly interesting.  One really likes the music (which has a catchy early-80's-disco-vibe).  The ball part is merely okay.  They trays on the bottom don't catch all the balls and they invariably end up under a couch or rolling off into the kitchen.  In the right location you could make this problem a bit more manageable.<br /><br />It comes in about 10 pieces that go together easily enough.  You do have to drive in a few screws and supply four AA batteries, but it takes no more than five minutes to put together.<br /><br />For the first day at least, it was also a big hit with my 5 and 6 year old boys.  Having them around to retrieve the balls for their sisters helped.  Once they get bored with helping them I'm afraid this might be destined for the garage.
B0061JPYX2|1.0|I have been playing Back to Black in my car for weeks now and very excitedly put on Lioness: Hidden Treasures CD after taking nearly 8 weeks to arrive. I think I only got to track 5 when I ejected it, never to be played again.  The quality of Amy's singing voice just wasn't there.  Amy's backing group sing a lot more to support her, and in some tracks there is this annoying drumming that wasn't on the original track, I was beginning to think it was to divert me away from the poor quality of singing.  I don't think this CD should have been released, even though we all yearned for a third album.  Leaving us with Amy's best album Back to Black would have been kinder to her honour as Lioness: Hidden Treasure reveals cracks in her voice and the strengh and power is gone.  It was too sad for me to listen to anymore.

B003HARV3Y|5.0|Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman, \\"Gamer\\") doesn't have a great life it seems, he has some friends at school but gets picked on by others, his mother is his rock but is together with a massive drunk who does nothing (Joe Pantoliano, \\"Daredevil\\"). Soon this changes though as Percy is found out to be the son of the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd, \\"Brave\\") and gets taken to a camp for children of the gods so they can be trained on how to use their powers in the best way to defend themselves. The rest of the movie has Percy not willing at first to accept his fate, but soon after making a couple of friends at the camp they decide to go retrieve the thunderbolt of Zeus before a war between the gods and Earth occurs.<br /><br />Given the PG rating its actually a well done flick, doesn't focus on a ton of the bad for too long (don't want to scar the younger viewers of course) and keeps the pace up through the action sequences especially the final few, with the last one being a grand display of special effects. The story is fairly simple, though the cast has some good actors in it including, Catherine Keener (\\"Capote\\"), Pierce Brosnan (\\"Goldeneye\\"), Uma Thurman (\\"Kill Bill\\"), Sean Bean (\\"Silent Hill\\") and Rosario Dawson (\\"Alexander\\") among others. Also nice how young up and coming performers besides Logan, there's Brandon T. Jackson (\\"Tropic Thunder\\") and Alexandra Daddario (\\"Bereavement\\") who has some of the most beautiful blue eyes I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this flick, it was just fun from start to finish and even though it was totally predictable at least it was enjoyable. ***1/2 out of 4 stars
B00007GZR5|2.0|I agree with those who were disappointed with poor film of a great book. Stars are for visuals only.<br />Plot changed a lot from book.  Guess getting rid of the kids cut down on salaries.<br /><br />Think the only movie I've ever seen that was as good as the book was TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  Every would-be adaptive screen writer should be required to study both book and film BEFORE beomg allowed to attempt the same.
0312641893|5.0|What I really want to tell you is: I love Cinder, the first book in The Lunar Chronicles. Oh, and Marissa Meyer rocks as an author! Yet as a reviewer, I need to back up those statements with reasons. Well, if I absolutely must give you more of an explanation, I enjoyed Cinder by Marissa Meyer on two accounts. As a reader, I love that it's a fantasy, set in the future, and based on a fairy tale. As a writer, I feel in awe of how many elements of fiction Marissa Meyer gets perfect. Now for a closer look at those statements.<br /><br />As a reader, I like that Cinder is a fantasy for young adults. The most recent trend is dystopian. Cinder fits into that genre, being set in a not-so-pleasant future. However, it branches beyond that, being about a teenage girl who is part cyborg and part human. Despite movies like A.I., which featured an advanced robotic boy who longs to become real, I haven't encountered many young adult books about cyborgs. Another way that Meyer sets Cinder apart from other dystopian fiction is that she set her story in futuristic Asia. Cinder's home is in New Beijing, delegates who meet with the prince are from actual countries (including Canada! ), and that bamboo screens, pergolas, and Buddha statues form the background of the city. Moreover, her main characters have olive complexion and dark hair and they're addressed formally in ways other than our American standard of Mr. and Mrs. and Miss. These realistic details aside, I most felt mesmerized by the androids, net screens, mechanical legs, hovercrafts, and other markings of a futuristic world. This is an area where Meyer excels-but more on that later. Let me wrap-up this paragraph by saying that Cinder is also based on a fairy tale--I'm sure you can guess which one. As such, Cinder has an evil step mother and step sister, meets a prince and attends his ball, and there's even a marriage proposal. Some reviewers criticized Meyer for basing Cinder on a fairy tale, because they felt this constrained her. I love fairy tales, including the modern ones when they are done well, and so I didn't have a problem with Meyer's choice. Moreover, I think she handled it quite smartly, in that she used what she needed and dropped what she didn't. For instance, while there are two step sisters, one of them is nice. Also, Cinder meets the prince before the ball, and Cinder's `fairy godmother' is instead a secretive doctor. Last, there's a Lunar Queen who is far more terrifying than the entire wicked step family.<br /><br />As a writer, I feel in awe of how many elements of fiction Marissa Meyer gets perfect. The plot instantly takes off in the very first paragraph, with the introduction of Cinder who is a most unusual character in being part cyborg and part human. On page three, Cinder is shunned by a fellow merchant, even though wires are not \\"contagious\\". One page later, Prince Kai shows up at Cinder's mechanical repair booth with a broken android that contains top-secret information. Before the end of the chapter, a plague outbreak forces the evacuation of the market. With that much action, you might wonder if there's any room for character development. In Meyer's skilled hands there is! Cinder is a delightful mix of human and cyborg parts. As such, she can feel squeamish over the singing of a death-themed nursery rhyme that the local children sing but also scan the prince's face and identify him from a net database. Her heart throbs at the sight of Prince Kai but she's a mechanical whiz, earns her own money, and is skilled with her hands. I identify with her because she has all the normal emotions of an adolescent girl, but doesn't derive all of her value from whether her crush has recently glanced her way. Real teenage girls will appreciate that Cinder isn't just a trembling flower but also has amazing strengths. Regarding the story's secondary characters, there are certainly those that are two-dimensional. For instance, a few of the minor characters are evil for no apparent reason and Prince Kai too conveniently falls in love with Cinder. However, the majority of the cast are quirky and complex; I love how sweet and fun Iko and Peony are.<br /><br />Because description more than anything else is Meyer's selling point, I'm dedicating a separate paragraph to it. Not only did Meyer become familiar with technological scientific advances enough that she could include a lengthy explanation of it on her website, but she also seamlessly integrates it into Cinder. I grew up living next to a bog and yet I don't think I could talk as naturally about it as Meyer does about cyborgs. For more than one reason, Meyer made the perfect choice when she opened Cinder by writing: \\"The screw through Cinder's ankle had rusted, the engraved cross markers worn to a mangled circle. Her knuckles arched from forcing the screwdriver....\\" In these few opening lines, I've fallen for Meyer's character and for her world. Better yet, I stayed immersed in the Cinder world for the entire three-hundred-and-eighty-seven pages.<br /><br />Upon recommendation of my teenage sister, I read Cinder this past July. I intended to simply skim through it again in preparation for this review but couldn't stick to that resolution. Despite having several other books to review, I found myself again being drawn into Cinder's world and reading thoroughly rather than scanning. Over the next year as I work on own novel, I imagine that I'll reread Cinder a few times again to remind myself how Meyer's captures her main characters' emotions and describes their world. Cinder is one of my favorite books of the year. It's exciting enough that I can picture other authors trying to emulate it. Could Meyer start a new trend of cyborg literature?arent reason and Prince Kai too conveniently falls in love with Cinder. However, the majority of the cast are quirky and complex; I love how sweet and fun Iko and Peony are.<br /><br />Because description more than anything else is Meyer's selling point, I'm dedicating a separate paragraph to it.

B0077SGMXM|5.0|Hours of fun play.  It gets quite hard and challenging, but you just can't give up.  Well thought of, good graphics, and good physics.
0060765488|5.0|Narnia let us to enter a new world along with the Pevensies, with a great story and the one of the most enjoyable books i've ever read.
B002UJIY7A|4.0|On a beautiful island two people on their honeymoon Cydney (Milla Jovovich, \\"The Fifth Element\\") and Cliff (Steve Zahn, \\"Joy Ride\\") decide to hike through a lush jungle and they happen to overhear about a few people who were brutally killed by what could be a man and a woman and that the killers could possibly have escaped to some remote location (like oh say the island there are on). After running into two more hiking couples, two of the people are Gina (Kiele Sanchez, TV's \\"The Glades\\") and Nick (Timothy Olyphant, \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\") and soon after everyone suspects the others could be the deadly couple and violence occurs.<br /><br />It does pick up after a while and the violence spices it up, so do the performances by Milla, Zahn and especially Timothy who as Gina states a couple of times just seems hard to kill. Its not a great film mind you but I mostly enjoyed the flick, it had a breezy air about it and while the reveal of the killer's is of no shock to anyone who has seen more than oh say two horror movies it is done in a goofy and funny way. The final sequences between the killers and the surviving characters are actually very well done and do keep your pulse up.<br /><br />I'll give credit to director David Twohy (\\"Pitch Black\\") for making a conventional plot at least fun to watch, cause the trailer is somewhat misleading (for obvious reasons mind you once you watch the actual film). So its no great feat in the world of film, but again its fun. **1/2 out of 4 stars.
030758836X|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it is original. Just when you think you have figured out the plot, WHAM!! The author hits you with a curve ball. Highly recommend if you enjoy psychological thrillers that move at a fast pace.
B004VRL4BM|5.0|I bought both Season 4 and 5 Blu-ray discs.  None would play on either Blu-ray player, my 2 year old Sony, or the Sony BDP-S590 I recently purchased.  I took both disks to BestBuy and found they won't play on Sony and Panasonic high end players, but will on Pioneer ones.  I bought a Pioneer BDP-140 which plays them well, and they are very enjoyable with great action and CGI effects, very graphic creatures.<br />  If this is an oddball version of BD, why don't you tell people on the ad?  Obviously a lot of other folks have run into the same problem?  Why isn't this made clear in the description so customers don't spend hours trying to find out why they don't play?  A little effort toward this wold avoid unnecessary returns.<br />  Why aren't all seasons offered in NTSC US-version standard DVD's instead of these expensive unreliable BD's?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a great app. I like the games but I ain't gonna lie its super hard and I don't like the way you have to reach a certain amount of points to progress.
B008MEM24S|5.0|just ignore those people who say its horrible its really fun and has a lot of levels you should buy it. it is worth the money. 5 stars!
B00122BEPA|4.0|Van Halen is Rock n Roll. All of David Lee Roth's screams to Eddie Van Halen's guitar shredding this album brings back all the live shows.  With exception of the newer songs that haven't grown on me yet, it is a great remastered album!
B0061S073A|5.0|I allow my kids to play games on my phone. I have quite a few games for my 3yr old. I once turned my back on my 3yr old (2 at the time) for a moment and he had accessed FaceBook and sent a friend's request to someone who commented on a friends post. As funny as that was, it could have been so much worse.<br /><br />This app fixes all of that. I can hand my kids my phone and allow them to play for how ever long they want with no worries. It has settings to give you some freedom. My kids can't navigate away from this (all their games are inside this app), they don't get the ad popups, they can't access the web, no in app purchases, etc... it is GREAT!

B008L1PYQU|2.0|I've been a huge kiss fan since Hotter than Hell came out and saw that tour and a ton of tours after that. So I'm a big Fan.<br />I'm not a big fan of this record however. I am using a very high quality system to play it on (Marantz 4400 and Marantz 6300 Turntable) Real top of the line audio. The tone of this album is tinny. I couldn't believe that I had to turn up the bass to make it listenable.<br /><br />I'm a big Ace Frehley fan as well and the lead in Sweet Pain was terrible. It was a sub-par Ace Lead on this record, the lead that appeared on the regular Destroyer was great. Just leave it alone<br /><br />all in all I'd say I bought a new Album cover but the vinyl isn't worth buying. Sorry. Cover looks cool however.
030758836X|2.0|The beginning is slow & boring building the background.  Then once she is gone it gets interesting, but only for a while.  This could have been an amazing thriller but the author turned it into a convoluted mess about three quarters of the way through.  By that time I couldn't care less what happened to any of the characters.  I ended up skimming the last several chapters in hopes that it would end in a  thrilling fashion.  Unfortunately, it just drug on and on and then fizzled to the end.  What a waste of my time!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've used this app for a while now and have had no issues. I especially like the voice alerts when battery life reaches a level that I choose. This app does what it is supposed to do very well, and has nice customization features. Easy to navigate through and quick response time.

0553386816|5.0|This is a collection of short stories that revisits some of Grisham's best loved settings.  There is something for everyone in this book--humor, tragedy and lots of legalisity lawyering(what Grisham does best!)  This book is just as amazing as a 'regular' novel.  Grisham is one of those rare authors whose voice caresses in your ear as you read.  You can't help but hear his Southernness and trueness.  He has a way of making me believe each story really happened in real life, just as he saw it.  My husband listened to the audiotape and said it was absolutely amazing.  Since it was read by the author, that is easy to believe.<br /><br />Every story in this book is a work of the master.  You won't be disappointed if you're a Grisham fan.  The most affecting story is one about a lawyer.  He's just a regular guy with a job, a wife, and aq couple of kids.  Life is going fine until he is kidnapped ad forced to the face the reality of one of the cases he has argued against.  It's tragic and haunting and just so darned good!
B007USWD0U|3.0|Though this movie was highly touted by reviewers and friends, I found the experience to be a bit maudlin.  The characters were involved with issues that seemed specific to such a small part of the population that I never developed even a passing concern for their outcome.  Not my cup of tea but others liked it.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this game so much I have been playing it for a whole dat now.  hopefully I can upgrade everything soon
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think that this is a great app for kids and adults. The puzzles are challenging but still fun and they make you think. Five stars for this game!!!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|This app can have a lot of pros and cons. This app is a,&quot;Need&quot; for some people because it can tell you the amount of battery you have left, how long to charge it until it is 100% healthy, and even how long you have(in min.) till your kindle dies. Some people are saying it is the,&quot;worst app ever&quot; because when your alarm for your device goes off like, 5% or less, it will send your device to the app and not allow you to play other games. I say it is opptional. If you want a app that tells you how much life you have, but you don't want a reminder, then don't get it. bottom line, get it if you want,just read the des. first.
0307120007|3.0|Paper seems very cheap. Won't last long for curious little hands. Contents look good but will be better if it's a board book. Since it's only 10 bucks, I won't bother return it.
B00913DPW2|4.0|extremely good graphics and perfect music.  challenging puzzles. I confess to using the online guide a time or two.  excellent suggestion re the jigsaw puzzle - put together pieces as often as possible.  I usually stay away from horror scenes but this was great fun. froze 3 times on my<br />kf but exiting or rebooting fixed it.  I am on the last leg of the game and it took me a couple of days to get there.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I've been reading some comments complaining about how this isn't \\"the promised director's cut\\" and how they think it's unfair to release this now and then that cut later.<br /><br />Joss Whedon, the director, has stated time and time again that the version released to theatres IS the director's cut, so there will not be a longer version of this film coming out in the future. If that would hold you back, don't be afraid, the chance of that happening is just about zero.<br /><br />As for all the trolls stating that this film is overrated to then proceed to disect its flaws: it's a film that has 4 films leading into it, has 6 superheroes, a superpowered villain, aliens and Samuel L. Jackson. Even without reading a description or review of this film, you should know it's not going to have a traditional goal of storytelling (in the sense of getting to know a character, throwing some romance their way and then making them fight the bad guy). No, the goal of this film is to entertain as much as possible and that's exactly what it does. The characters ARE fleshed out as much as they can be over the course of 2 hours and 20 minutes of film in the hands of a very capable writer and director. The film is hilarious (as can be testified to by anyone who has seen it. I have never heard an audience in a theatre roar as much as they did during this film, and it's not even a comedy), it's fun, the action sequences are engaging and superbly filmed. It's a highly enjoyable climax to what the Marvel Cinematic Universe has spent the last decade building up. And that is why this film is --at the time I'm writing this review-- the number 3 best-selling film of all time.<br /><br />In conclusion, this edition is definitely worth your money if you liked the film or if you want to see a fun, superpoweredly entertaining film. Your abs will be tired from the laughter-induced work out, but ultimately greatful.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />I loved this book but I was so sad when prim died. Katniss killed coin and president snow is dead. Katniss realizes she loves peeta. Peeta try's to kill katniss . I would purchase this book a thousand times

B001974DG0|5.0|[[ASIN:B001974DG0 Watchers]]<br /><br />This is my second book by Dean Koontz, the first was False Memory. I've reached page 131, no doubt i will finish this one also. Another thrilling, entertaining, fantasy written so good you almost think it's reality. No doubt in my further reading I will look for more books by this brilliant writer.<br />Thanks Dean :-)<br /><br />Bent Jørgensen
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Great title in a best edition on Blu-ray. Theatrical edition is good but Extended edition (included in this edition) is better.<br />Image clear and a imprassive sound (DTS).<br />Recomended!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really enjoy this app though I wish it didn't use wi fi since I cant use it at church but over<br />all I enjoy it and it keeps me on track doing my devos!
0439023521|4.0|The book wasn't as graphic as the movie.  Some of the characters were different in the book than in the movie.  It's a story about kids killing kids so doing a movie about that should have meant diligence in the portrayal.  The book handled it better.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good book since I just love mysteries. Well thought out and written. I have already purchased another by this author, Gillian Flynn. I very much like her style of writing.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this is a great app! its so much fun! and I just love it! it us so useful! and easy to make pictures to make things FUN!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I read the trilogy and loved it.  The film is not as bad a rendition of the novel, there were moments that took me right back to the book which were nicely done. I loved the casting of everyone except for Sine and Peter (what were they thinking with this peter!).  But here's what I think, this book is very rich, nuanced and detailed and the movie simply rushed right through the story leaving out many layers.  I believe the Hunger Games trilogy would have been better if it were turned into a high quality 3 season teleseries where they allow for all the relevant content of the book to be realized over time and keep the version as close to the book as possible, I would have preferred that to the thin shell of a rush job. However for what it is they did a decent job.  Visually I think they caught the feeling and aesthetic of the novel. They totally botched to Cornucopia which was a large gold structure and they totally downsized the tail end of the game which was fierce. The film didn't catch the darkness portrayed in the book and I don't like the way they downplayed the significance of the Mockingjay pin.  There was so much material in the book they could have tapped into but again that would have taken an HBO tele series or something like that, not a one shot film. They missed that whole world developed in the book, I'm not sure if it would make much of an impression if a viewer hadn't read the book.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|An enthralling read with twists and turns to keep you guessing. Another Jeffrey Adcher book that was hard to put down.
0425263908|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I enjoyed reading this book...actually never put it down after I picked it up and read it from cover to cover within a few hours.<br /><br />The good stuff:<br />Bared to You took the time to develop the characters and they are far more likeable than the characters in 50 Shades.<br /><br />The heroine though emotionally damaged is strong, instead of the weak/pathetic way some books portray these women. If you're like me and found Ana (50 Shades) to be quite annoying, then you'll like Eva in Bared to You.<br /><br />The other characters in Bared to You are developed and interesting...honestly, I can't remember most of the other characters from 50 Shades.<br /><br />The writing in Bared to You is far better than 50 Shades. While I enjoyed 50 Shades for what it was, sometimes getting through the bad writing was tough.<br /><br />The not so good stuff:<br />Unlike 50 Shades which made the D/s aspect part of the book from go, Bared to You didn't even hint at it until damn near the end of the book, then never mentioned it again (guess this means I have to read book 2). I bought this book because it was recommended for readers who liked the D/s nature of 50 Shades - if that's what you're looking for, skip this one!<br /><br />The sex scenes at first were ok, then it got kind of stupid and I started skipping them. Maybe the scenes would have been hotter if they DID NOT SPEAK. Stupid lines from Eva like `You make me come so hard' got pretty lame, pretty quick. And they way she described his you-know-what in every scene was laughable at best. The sex scenes needed to be better written...they sounded as if a teenager wrote them.<br /><br />The lack of originality - Anyone who read 50 Shades then read Bared to You would laugh at these \\"similarities\\" (when I was in college, they called this plagiarism lol)<br />1) The heroine lives with a roommate who dresses her, does her hair, and wants to protect her from the hot but dangerous guy.<br />2) Super rich, super hot, super hung, emotionally damaged guy wants to claim her<br />3) The stalker-ish behavior of the man (having her followed, the background checks, knowing what gym she goes to, what coffee she liked, the security detail etc.)<br />4) Speaking of stalker-ish behavior, stepping over the line and getting involved in her work just to be closer to her<br />5) The `other woman' - you know, the one from his past who's mean to the heroin but he can't stay away from her because they're `friends'<br /><br />Decision:<br />If you want a good, decently written book with likeable characters, READ THIS BOOK.<br /><br />If you're looking for an erotic book, or much less a BDSM book DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.
B007K3JCAE|2.0|I know this is a little late, but tonight for movie night we rented the 2nd Sherlock Holmes movie that so many people raved about.<br /><br />Ouch ... this was painful<br /><br />All 6 people at my home yelled out .. \\"GONG\\" about 30 minutes into it.<br /><br />Wonderful sets and wardrobe ......... but it was like slapstick humor.<br /><br />Too goofy, like a parody.<br /><br />We were waiting for Jerry Lewis and the 3 Stooges to jump out at anytime.<br /><br />It was NOT Sherlock Holmes, it was some comedy spoof.<br /><br />It seemed to be nothing but an endless romp of fight scenes done in s silly comical way.<br /><br />The whole group of us voted to eject it and stop watching it.

B0086700CM|5.0|The game runs flawlessly on my nexus 7 tablet. Absolutely no lag whatsoever, and the tilting works like it should be. Just because your phone is old and outdated and can't run this game smoothly doesn't mean it deserves a one star rating and being called a crappy game. Your device is what's crappy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|cool dude I hope they have Lep vs Mario it would be beast right pep would probably win though right
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I bought this CD and it immediately became one of my favorite Joe Walsh CD's (records)- and I have pretty much ALL since his first James Gang LP.....and Joe is timeless. The guy can write, can sing like he's still a crazy kid, and can rip up the fretboard with the best of them. The Deluxe Edition also comes with a DVD that really makes this a special set. Joe Walsh has a sense of humor and a perspective on rock over the past 40 years that brings insight that only Joe Walsh can provide (he recites a story about him and Keith Moon doing some crazy stuff that is laugh out loud great - unbelievable!).....also, I play the guitar for a hobby and this DVD shows the fingering Joe performs on several songs that is easy to see and learn from - well worth the price for the DVD!<br /><br />Okay....Joe is touring right now (summer 2012), so I got a chance to see him perform at Wolf Trap Center for the Performing Arts (A National Park outdoor venue in DC suburbs)....I thought I'd hear tons of this new CD - oh no, not so - sure there were a few new selections, but Joe went back...went way back to the James Gang days and played things like The Bomber, Walk Away, and Funk 49,....then moved through the years with an excellent selection of past favorites culminating with an encore of Rocky Mountain Way and Life's Been Good. If you've never seen Joe Walsh, don't pass up the chance, the guy relates to the audience telling stories as he plays...and he can rip it up - there isn't some young dude handling the lead licks - it's all Joe and he is tight! What you hear on the CD is what you will hear in the concert.<br /><br />This CD is something special from Joe.....it is a real treat with some great, kicking tunes....it's pure  from the \\"So What\\" and \\"The Confessor\\" days (he played The Confessor in concert btw)......Joe Walsh is timeless and still has the energy and drive that other bands wish they could match......a truly fine recording - highly recommended - do yourself a favor and get the deluxe version with the DVD.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks: (all are good - not a bad track here - and not in order of my favorites)<br /><br />1. Analog Man (Great fun Joe tune - I totally relate to this tune)<br /><br />2. Band Played On (kind of a mystical sounding tune with a sitar sound - psychedelic but rocks!)<br /><br />3. One Day at a Time (You can hear Jeff Lynne's influence on this one - Joe's self reflective story)<br /><br />4. Funk 50 - Oh Yeah....I love this one - think a modern day take on Funk 49 with a shout out loud sing along sound)<br /><br />5. India - really cool instrumental - Joe rips it up on this one - starts with a guitar riff that could be an AC/DC riff - then settles into a great driving beat with soaring leads and riffs that just carry you away - exceptional tune)<br /><br />6. Fishbone - Down and dirty grinding tune \\"My baby's got a fishbone... stuck down near where she swallers...\\" a stomping tune....<br /><br />7. But I Try - Features Little Richard on vocals and written by the original James Gang (Joe, Jim Fox and Dale Peters - from an old tape Joe found dating from a jam session in 1970!) - what a great way to end a killer CD - this track kicks! With Little Richard on vocals, what else would it be!<br /><br />This CD is pure fun....enjoy my friends, enjoy!<br /><br />Catch Joe live if you get the chance!
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I was glad it was no a triller, when reading it I thought on Harrison Ford in The Fugitive. You can get the adventure, the science, the romance, but also you can go deepen and have a personal learning from it.
1609611543|4.0|THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN BY A DR AND HAS  TRIED THESE CONCEPTS ON HIS PATIENTS WITH AWESOME RESULTS. GOOD INFO HERE.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Having had a number of friends that have suffered from Alzheimer's (Including early onset), I think this book does an amazing job of portraying the process from the patient's point of view. The book, in that regard, has parallels with Faulkner's Abolsom, Ablsolom. Be warned: if you are a woman going through menopause, this book has the ability to convince you that you, too, are in the early stages of Alzheimer's.<br /><br />Apart from the issues to the disease, there are a number of puzzling threads that are left unresolved. It is never clear why the husband is not more supportive of his wife in the process. But I do think it does a good job of depicting the conflicting emotions of the children and others who love an patient with Alzheimer's, in coming to grips with the realities and limitations of the disease.<br /><br />The book also contains the narrative drama necessary to support a novel of this type.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Wonderful adaptation - truer to the book than all previous movies. Even though I know the story well, made me jump half out of my seat at least twice - both times I've seen it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I think that who had suffered any kind of harasment may feel insulted, this is not Romance. This book is not supposed to be a psychological analysis, it was made to enjoy the plot, but nobody should be excited with the most deepest suffering than others have felt. I read it till the end, I hopped I was overreacting and search for a relief, but I did not find the explanation to such a twisted kind of relationship.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Good price.  Bright light. Three way switch for off, on, and auto.  Will purchase at least two more.  No need to struggle with dark spots in my rooms such as under the computer table where I have my computer on the floor and most of the USB ports are on the top of the unit.  Now as soon as I put my hand under the desk to plug into a USB port this little light shines and now there's no feeling my way around.  Saves time and I don't get as frustrated.  That alone is worth it!  Now I've become aware of other places such as in cabinets.  Sure I can see but I put one of these light in there and now I can REALLY see.  Just makes me want to get all organized and stuff. LOL!  Put one in my cubby in my headboard, now I can see clearly whats, what.  One in the bathroom, two in the hallway and no need to flip on light bulbs at night just to go to the bathroom. When I need to walk into my home office just to grab something, there's no need to turn on the overhead room light (it gets warm enough in there with the computers) just open door, this little light comes on, grab what I need and walk out.  Makes things more automatic for me. Same with grabbing a tool or two from the garage.  I am using Sanyo re-chargeable batteries looks like this is going to be a very economical solution for our family.  These can be used for trucks, campers, and storage units.  I like this particular one because you can turn the unit off or you can turn it on, or your can let motion or lack of motion govern.  Put some matching Velcro under the hood of your car.

B0088TG252|3.0|From Paris with Love is 5 star, this is 3.5 stars in the same genre.  Good flick, not great.  Lots of action.  Nice anonymous type ending.
B0065FFMR0|5.0|There is nothing I didn't like about this series. I've always been a fan of horror and this had everything I love about the genre without going over the top. Scenes were gory without being too gory. The plot was relatable and believable. I thought it was brilliant how certain real historical events  were worked into the story. So many times at the end of horror movies I'm left with unanswered questions but because this was an entire season instead of a ninety minute movie, I got attached to the characters much more and found the whole experience truly satisfying. I hope season two is this good.

B0000ABPLG|1.0|DVD was for REGION 2 (Europe) and will not play on my Panasonic DVD player. Total waste of my time and money. Typical unscrupulous sales practice from a company that cares little about the customer. I will never do business with them again and advise everyone else to avoid.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Bought this after seeing it on Wil Wheaton's YouTube show \\"Tabletop\\". It's a fun game, easy to pick up and a quick play. My kids enjoy it, friends have a blast with it and even my youngest has started to pick up the probabilities aspect of gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|Luckily, Earth is far from the interspace wars that rage throughout the universe; that is what makes it such an attractive place for alien refugees seeking asylum on some unnoticed planet inhabited by a simple, somewhat-intelligent, and technologically-backward species that is willing to make room for them; of course, we jumped at the chance to establish a safe haven in exchange for a few trinkets. . . .<br /><br />An enclave was established in New York City.  By treaty, the aliens had to blend in and not reveal their unearthly origin.  While a few lucky alien species could pass themselves off as human; most had to rely on organic-mechanical contrivances.<br /><br />Keeping the aliens in line was a tough policing job and keeping their presence on Earth a secret required constant vigilance, and in general, it worked, but unfortunately not all species are covered; one such, is a particularly obnoxious species: the Bugs. . . .<br /><br />One night, not long ago, an unlicensed, immature Bug crashed his flying saucer into Edgar's pickup truck.  Luckily for the Bug, Edgar stormed out of his house to see what had happened.  Unfortunately for Edgar, Bugs are indiscriminate eaters and Edgar's skin would suit it well until it could find and snatch the Arquillian's prize possession; foolishly, an Arquillian had brought it to this defenseless planet. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): 4.5 to 5.  Languages and Subtitles: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Thai.  Additional Subtitles: Chinese, Korean, Arabic, Dutch, Indonesian, and Alien.  The \\"Alien\\" option is underwhelming.<br /><br />Special Features: possible additions, beyond those listed in older DVD reviews: a MIB trivia game and \\"Ask Frank the Pug\\" ( he is an alien, in a dog suit, who has the inside scoop).  He will answer your questions about love, money, and etc.  Be sure to talk loud; Frank is a little hard of hearing. . . .

B003N7ORNI|5.0|I got this book for Christmas along with Heroes of Olympus:The Lost Hero, & The Throne of Fire, the second book in this trillogy. On the first few pages I was totaly hooked. I know a lot about Eygyptian mythology so this went really well with the coverage. It all started when Carter & Sadie Kane's dad blew up the rosseta stone. I won't give any spoilers exept that there is quite a few explosions that I love.<br /><br />P.S, I totaly recomend the Percy Jackson series, Heroes of Olympus series,( No. 3 &#34;The Mark Of Athena&#34; is coming out 2 Sep!) Deltora Quest, and Animorphs.<br /><br />P.P.S. If you type in kindle books for free you can have a lot more books in your archive!<br />Peace Out Dudes.

B005HHSXP0|5.0|An epic sequal to an epic sereis! Percy finds himself with two snake-haired ladies who refuse to die. He tried everything droping bowling balls on their heads , run them over in a police car . But they just re-formed like a snowman un-melting. But what really sucked was thet he could only remember little outside his own name. The only thing he as sure of was his girlfriend Annabeth. Her face and how she kissed him when he did something stupid. Since he woke up in the ruins of a old house he exepted the messed up world of Roman gods and monsters. When the gorgons Stheno and Eyrale caught up with him he grabbed the free sample platter that Stheno was holding and sledded towards the fast lane. Ever since Percy left the Wolf house his internal radar was guiding him west and it was ping like crazy now. He knew he must be to high up because ther could be nouthing here. He lost the platter on the way down and dogged the four lanes of traffic. Standing next to what looked like a maintainance tunnel was two guards dressed in Roman armor. Near where he landed was a old hippie bag laddie. She told him to carry her through the tunnel,acrros the plains ,and throgh the river. Percy dident know about any river but carryed her because the gorgons wetent geting any closer. the guards let him pass and when Percy got to the river he saw a huge Roman camp.<br /><br />Charecters:Percy. I am so glad Percy came back(With his sword ,Riptide.) as so him so him at all times.<br /><br />Hazel: Hazels only 13,but usualy comferts the older boys. She is daughter of Pluto and has a curse.<br /><br />Frank: Frank is a stocky and extremely strong and has a little baby face,but also hase quite a few secrets as well.<br /><br />Summary: I absolutly love this book and how sweetly everything about it flows with Rick Riordand previous books. It is also bombarded by great humor and to my suprise doesent leadthe quest! I can't wait fot the &#34;Mark of Athena&#34; book wich is the next one in the series.

B002SSUQFG|2.0|I've had this watch for 3 months now and already the band is starting to wear out around the adjustment holes. The watch looses about 3 minutes a week. As it's an automatic this was expected but 3 minutes is too much. I like the style and the face and it's a comfortable watch to wear. I probably will not buy another, when I need a new watch.<br />UPDATE.....After this review I put this watch away. I recently started to wear this watch,again, April 2014. 5 weeks later the watch stopped and has become even more unreliable. I only used it for every day wear and not for any hard use or work. Not good, I'm reducing it to 1 star.<br /><br />UPDATE......Hi, After this watch stopped I returned it to the Seiko Repair center as it was still under warranty. Came back in a week and so far it looses only  seconds a week. I'm surprised to say the least.Still not worth the drama,but going up to 2 stars.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Taking a college course in Science Fiction and Fantasy, I realized when listening to my professors that maybe my education had been neglected.  Fortunately, your inner child is still viable into adulthood. Also the literary trek has enough divergence to satisfy the most rabid of movie fans.  Thanks to them, I read 'The Narnia Chronicles' in my twenties and, now, this, 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' during middle age.<br /><br />There are plenty of differences between the book and the movie.  It would be a spoiler to elaborate, but one example is that the China Land and the Witch of the South have details the movie couldn't afford to go, so that in itself is worth visiting.<br /><br />As this century roots more and more for literacy and 'Harry Potter' and the '...Wimpy Kid' keep them occupied and savor our hopes for continued literacy, L. Frank Baum's classic remains a great alternative that kids and adults can discover for the first time.

014241493X|3.0|I was really excited to read something by John Green. I carefully read each description and picked the one I was most interested in. I've heard nothing but great things about him, but this did not live up to my expectations. It was nothing really new to the genre and really did not feel like it even warranted my reading the entire thing. Though, I did finish it just so I'd be able to write based on the entire book.<br /><br />What I liked: I liked the minor characters. I liked that Ben and Lacey are together (Even though the whole prom queen/nerd idea is way overplayed). I liked that we get to see several of the \\"popular\\" bully kids turn into real people (although, this too is way overdone across the genre). I kind of liked Margo, but only some of the time, but I think that was the point. Since it was drilled into your head that she had so many dimensions. I really like the whole idea of paper towns that exist only on maps. I liked some sides of Margo that I could relate to.<br /><br />What I didn't like: I couldn't stand Quentin. He complains constantly that his friends don't care about finding Margo, but he doesn't care about anything but that. Really, though, his love of her has no foundation. The Whitman thing got old, very fast. I'm, admittedly not a huge fan of Whitman, but I now don't even want to hear his name. I almost felt like Green was saying, \\"Hey, look, I know how to analyze poetry!\\" I'm not sure if this was meant to be a teaching moment, if maybe it was meant to be a clever way of figuring out where Margo went. Honestly, though, it was just irritating. The writing was repetitive. \\"Point in fact\\" is not a phrase I think I've ever heard anyone use aloud, but it was on every few pages in this book. The dialogue between the main characters is borderline ridiculous. They speak like no one I've ever heard in my life.<br /><br />I may at some point try another of John Green's books out because I wanted to read Looking for Alaska, but this one has kind of put me off from him. Papertowns could have been a pretty cool idea, but the delivery left much to be desired.me off from him. Papertowns could have been a pretty cool idea, but the delivery left much to be desired.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I purchased this for my Baby Jogger City Mini GT. It fits well and could clearly fit any number of strollers. The backside is black which is what I have facing out so I don't see the red logo. Great purchase, has a nice frame to keep it structured. Much cheaper than the brand one and I like that it isn't too bulky to obstruct my stroller's fold.
B007P6PLDI|5.0|This is not a true review but a few of my observations and a couple questions that I hope someone else may have an opinion about as well.  This was re-edited from my Face Book page blog.  Well, I finally opened my copy of the Smashing Pumpkins Reissue Pisces Iscariot Deluxe Box Set. I had been saving it for my birthday. This is going to take a while to digest but even just getting a clean copy of their cover of the Velvet Underground \\"Venus In Furs\\" was practically worth the entire price. Damn, both the original VU and the SP versions put me into a trance. That song is dope! Actually the SP version of \\"Venus In Furs\\" sounds to me like if it were Pink Floyd doing it. Very psychedelic and trippy. Much of expanded album is unreleased songs but I actually already have many of them on bootleg albums and web downloads. Billy Corgan has been giving stuff away for years. Also many of the songs can be had as different mixes available from the Reel Time Sessions. But all in all, a huge amount of great material. I am starting with disc 2 to listen to. The facsimile cassette of their first demo cassette is interesting to get but I think I should copy it to my PC and burn a CD-R of it before playing the cassette more than once. I am sure the DVD will be interesting as well. The song list certainly is. I wish there were an explanation of the enclosed picture cards, family and stuff? One seems to be a picture of Billy as a young boy. Did anyone else notice that the cover pictures on this release are watercolor painting copies of the original three cover photographs from the original CD, LP, and Cassette version of the album. Nice idea for something different yet.<br /><br />Well I gave everything but the cassette the once through so far. Actually I listened to Disc 2 twice. That one is the most interesting. The Basement Jam selections on the DVD Disc are really interesting even though so many of those songs sound similar. They are different from the Reel Time Sessions and others Ihave of those songs. That goes for audio Disc 2 as well. Or the song is a different or new mix or completely new song to me. Disc 1 is of course the original album. I don't hear much difference in the mix here, that is probably a good thing. Considering for a few of the alternate mixes or recordings of songs on Disc 2 I prefer the original ones I have elsewhere. The only real negative for me is the Bonus Clips on the DVD: the sound and video is terrible. Most of the live bootlegs I have of the Smashing Pumpkins are better. But it does capture a small place in time of the band -- not their best, but...<br /><br />The booklet article is cool, would have liked more in fact. I have my own little story about Pisces Iscariot. It was the first SP item I ever bought. I had heard the SP on the radio, about the same time as the Breeders short career. I liked what I heard so I decided to give the SP a try as a whole CD. It just so happened that the SP CD with the lowest priced at the time at Rhino Records, Claremont, CA of the three in stock (PI, SD, MCIS) was PI. So I bought it. Like a lot of people it seems I thought it was just a regular album, not a cut-out compilation. Upon listening I could not tell, it was fantastic. But I knew little about the band at that time. Looking act the pictures I found of the band I thought they were two men and two women! I was soon embarrassed to learn that the Asian one was male, James Iha. And upon learning through the media that their best album to date was another one. Better, I thought the what the hell could that be like... ...I would soon learn! It may be odd, and I understand why SD is so highly rated, but to this day I still love MCIS the most of all SP albums.<br /><br />I have a pretty good idea what the cassette will sound like as I have down loads of the songs elsewhere. I do wonder how they created the facsimile cassette though as I thought two of the songs' masters were lost (Sun & She). Did they find similar versions to substitute? Has anyone else noticed how muddy sounding Jackie Blue is on this RI? The original VA Compilation album it was on sounded fine other than being a bit too loud and with some distortion. But the new PI version sounds awful, and muddy and muffled. What happened, did the other record company not give them the original tapes back?

B0054JZC6E|5.0|very nice game.l play every time I can. it does not matter what time of the day or what day it is.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game has the mysterious playability in spades. Excellent time waster and well worth the $3 price. Graphics are kind of retro which is fine as the game harkens back to a time when playing games was about the game being fun not being more graphically realistic than the others.
0767827694|5.0|If you love period drama, this will give you much drama and many, many periods.  I just caught this on TCM and I was quite taken with it, I wonder how I had never seen it before?  Tilda Swinton is mesmerizing in a gender-bending, can we say \\"double role?\\"  The costuming, settings and music are all astonishing.  Be forwarned however-as breezy as the film is you will be expected to work a bit to full in the blanks here and there.
0743454537|5.0|How far would you go to save your child's life? Brian and Sara Fitzgerald, the parents of Anna, constantly worries about their other daughter, Kate, who has leukemia. When Kate was first diagnosed with leukemia, Brian and Sara decided to have baby who would be genetically created and be a close donor match for Kate. From the day Anna was born, she has constantly undergone numerous operations and surgeries for Kate. Each chapter that was dedicated to the characters gain insight into the complicated decisions family members make. I would highly recommend this book because of Picoult's unique writing style and inspirational message.<br />Each character has their own individual chapters dedicated to them. In Sara's chapter, she talks about the past events that lead up to the present; she provides background information for the reader. Brian shows a side different to that of Sara; he is more compassionate towards Anna and cares about her. In Anna's chapter, she talks about the events that occur to her at that moment. In Jesse's chapter, he talks about activities that he did to disappoint or call out for attention to his parent. Although Jesse's behavior and attitude disappoint Brian and Sara, Anna's decision to be medically emancipated from her parents is was what disappoints them even more.<br />Although it was assigned as a summer reading for school, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\", is one of the best novel I have ever read because we learn about the perspective of a young child who must constantly face the dilemma of whether she should help her sister while putting her life in danger or do what she believes to be right. Jodi Picoult makes a reader realize that parents have to make many difficult decisions for their children; she also illustrates what some parents have to face: the idea of losing their child. \\"I can't stand the though of losing her,\\" and not being able to see their child grow up. \\"It was equally as difficult for Kate to get honestly excited about things like homecoming and SAT's when there was no guarantee she'd be around to experience them.\\" This novel makes me wonder how far a parent would go to help save their child's life. It also demonstrates the controversy between something that is moral and immoral. This controversy is similar to the debate about whether stem cell research is just or unjust. There are many surprising twists in the plot. This is the best book Picoult has ever written.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I was a young teenager when the original Star Trek series came out. I have been a big fan ever since. I must admit that I have watched this new vision of Star Trek several times now and have enjoyed it each time. The casting of the young Enterprise crew is simply brilliant. Most look and sound extremely close to the originals while at the same time possessing a new uniqueness. The casting director was a major contributor to this film. These youngsters are a treat to watch and especially the interaction. This whole movie was filmed to be epic-like and I feel they have accomplished the task quite well. This movie is visually stunning. It has a Star Wars like quality to it. Action packed but a great drama at the same time, with some comedic moments sprinkled in. The only flaw I saw was that why did Nero spend all that time and effort going back in time to get his revenge on Spock, when he could have simply warned his planet of the coming supernova and tried to save as many lives as possible instead? Highly illogical. That withstanding, I still love this movie! Since the price of this DVD so low, now is a great time to pick this one up. It is a worthy addition to your collection. Nuff said!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love the widget that tells you how much battery life you have left. As a task killer to save the battery I haven't noticed too much of an improvement. I agree with everyone else that its annoying trying to use your phone when it is charging because the app keeps popping up. overall a good app though.
0307887448|5.0|Just finished reading. This is an awesome book, very realistic. I identified with the characters. The books is also very well written, which is rare for the sci-fi. If you are a gamer, this will be total haven. I am not a gamer, but I enjoyed the book immensely. Highly recommend to anyone.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I am going to stop trying the free versions of Playrix apps because they are so good I have to buy the full version!

B002BWP49M|5.0|The acting has come a long way since the first movie.  Many of the scenes are so much more believable in this movie versus the first one.<br /><br />Overall, I thought that this followed the book pretty closely, the exception being the attack on the Cullen's.  I did think that they did a fairly good job of conveying how the wolves communicate.<br /><br />Can't wait for the last one!

0345803485|5.0|I really enjoyed all three of the books. Though not totally realistic it one of the best love stories I've read. I've heard a lot of complaints about it being an exotic novel, but in my opinion it was very well written and much less dirty than other things I've read! 5 stars! Any book I read in less that 48hrs gets 5 stars!
B007KAJG3K|5.0|I really love this movie.  I found myself laughing more throughout this movie than the previously. I also thought that the plot was much better.  My favorite parts were always when you don't see Holmes but he's in the room....<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first movie, you will love this one.  I would highly recommend purchasing it has a lot or replay value.

B000002KGT|5.0|Talented musicians, some of whom are in relationships with each other that are falling apart, put this fantastic collection together.  These songs all are written and sung from gut wrenching emotions.  The listener can feel the anger in Second Hand News, the melancholy mood of Songbird, and the hopefulness of Don't Stop.  The order of the songs tells the entire story well.  Finally, I am amazed at the excellent sound and emotions of The Chain, a cut not originally meant to be played or even written but composed of cut pieces from previous recording sessions with some lyrics added.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of any song or album that expresses raw emotions, whatever they may be, and Rumours is the best album ever recoreded that does this.
1400031524|5.0|This books deals with the problems of the police department and everyone in general following the new era of freedom from Soviet oppression.  The problems of secrecy and lack of trust in people around you are stressed.  A Swedish policeman is sent to help solve a murder; his attempts to ask questions are stymied and he is constantly shadowed.  I purchased this book second-hand to give to a friend who had just been on a lecture tour of one of the Baltic countries.  She had been told many tales of persecution and secrecy so I thought this book would be enlightening for her.  (I had read it in Swedish so I couldn't share my book with her.)
B001OQCV6K|4.0|This movie is pretty good.  It has a lot of value in repeat play, its one of those movies you can certainly watch more than once and still get enjoyment from it.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|Well, Super 8 isn't a bad movie and it's not amazing either. It's a 3.5 but I'll round up instead of down. The story focuses on a group of Junior Highschool children making a independent film. During the film they get caught in the middle of a disaster and that's where the story begins. Super 8 Mixes The Goonies, with Godzilla (that horrible remake one) and E.T.. If you think that's a strange and unexpected mix well, this movie is just that. It's has it's serious moments (mostly drama) but it has it's lighthearted moments too. The Alien doesn't make its full on screen appearance until later in the film but like Godzilla it can be seen in the shadows running around and tearing up the town. There is action in the movie but in between that action is adolescent drama that results in long drawn out scenes. These scenes just make you wonder what the Alien is doing while the characters on screen are crying out their feelings.<br /><br />Overall Super 8 is a decent family movie and worth checking out if your board but but just don't expect to blown away by it.

1477419497|5.0|\\"Murder on the Cote d'Azure\\" was an extremely gripping read, one of those books which one needs to hide oneself away from possible interruptions.  The plot not only stymies the investigators but also the reader, while the sprinkling of French throughout the book both add to the atmosphere as well as give further depth to a number of the characters.  The clever title takes on much greater significance from later conversation with the intriguing Madame Zouk, provoking much thought about a crime that is perhaps not as straightforward as one might first think.  Action-packed, fast-paced and filled with colourful images, this novel must be a great candidate for film.  I look forward with eager anticipation to reading the others in the series.
0767803434|1.0|Impeccable production of a wildly absurd story. . .  The US president single-handedly (or nearly so) takes on a half-dozen extremely well-armed terrorists, carrying out feats worthy Bond, James Bond. But everytime he gives in when the leading terrorist threatens the president's wife or daughter. In addition to the absurdities, i also find it unpleasant to see the US president being tortured and degraded by the terrorists. Also, the director seems to use the movie to promote his personal politics.
B0036T32LQ|1.0|this is my first amazon review, and i am writing because this movie is horrible!!! i tried to believe all the the positive reviews, but it was awful. i love psychological movies.....but this was just groundhog day with a horrible plot and no ending and leaves you wishing you had watched dora the explorer instead. seriously. i have never reviewed an item and i am telling you i threw aside my laziness just to save you from this movie. everyone who thought it was good has never seen a real film or is crazy!! DO NOT WATCH IT!!

B002ZG98UK|5.0|I love the movie franchise (and the games as well), so take that with a grain of salt.  That said, I love the 3D version of this movie.  I already own the 2D, but recently got a 3D TV, so this was the first 3d blu ray I bought to test it out.  Again, I love the movies, so I'm probably biased, but this made the movie even better for me.  If you are new to RE or just looking for something to show off your 3D TV performance, probably other options out there.  But if you're a fan of the franchise and don't already have the 3D disc, I would 100% recommend getting it...Retribution is due out in theaters in a couple of weeks, and when it hits blu ray 3D, I will actually pre-order that and pay full price if necessary!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Motorola Electrify running 2.3.5 - Jetpack Joyride is one of my favorite games so far. Installed this about a month ago and really enjoyed it, but I held off on the review to see how long it would hold my attention. The popular temple game bored me after a week, and this plays a little like that. Collect these coins and buy power-ups. Where the game differs is the variety of power-ups, the bonus slot reel after you lose, and the inclusion of a quest-like system to keep you playing. Must have app this year.
B0049U4INC|4.0|This will be a short review, for I am a man of few words.<br /><br />I'm in sales as a territory manager in the Carolinas for a manufacturer in the natural products industry. From reading this book, I was able to glean principles to apply in my day to day business with accounts; even though I think this book is geared more toward entrepreneurs.<br /><br />I read a review where someone said this book was too simple. Exactly! I think the book was suppose to be simple. Just as doing business with anyone today should be made simple. This is one of the points I take from 'Enchantment', how to simplify business with the accounts and consumers I come into contact with.<br /><br />The \\"How To Achieve Likeability\\" and \\"How To Achieve Trustworthiness\\" are two factors that play a big role in what I do in sales. So the bottom line for me here is, it's about building and maintaining the relationship. This makes doing business easier in the long run.<br /><br />The company I work for gives their territory managers multi-paged pitch books to use in selling promotions to accounts. I dislike using them. Too many pages. Guy's 10-20-30 rule is what I now follow. I tweak my Keynote presentations to make them short and sweet. All the other information from the pitch-books I learn and can relay without a slide.

1451648537|5.0|As a keen Apple user of the last 15-20 years I was strangely devastated when Steve Jobs passed. Whilst this wasn't a surprise it still upset me. I'm keen into biographies and more so from people that interest me and companies that appeal to me. Once I started I found it hard to put down and constantly said to myself, the next chapter I'll put it down!<br /><br />From a content point of view, if you're interested in business stories, start up stories and generally good biographies then you'll not be disappointed. I chuckled at points and also came close to tears. What a fantastic book that reflects everyones opinion of Steve, good or bad. Personally, they guys a legend to me! Ironically I finished on my iPad!<br /><br />Great book!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I honestly cannot see why this became a best seller, it's poorly written and the story is not even beleivable nor did I find the characters sympathetic.  The much talked about sex scenes didn't even do it for me, as someone else remarked it seemed as if the book might have been written by a teenager.
0375842209|5.0|One of the most poignant, beautiful stories I have ever read in my life.  The prose is so touching and eloquent; you know, the type where you go back and read a sentence over and over.  Towards the end I had to stop to wipe away tears more than once.  This book will stay with me forever.  Very special.
B007SGM084|5.0|A must read for and one that enjoys romances (Steamy) (Hot) (Warm) the best. I admit I am only half way in the first book (Bought this morning) will re post another when I finish all three books.
0307716546|5.0|This book was so full of surprises, I can't even begin to tell you... and don't worry, I won't.  Several times I thought I had it figured out, only to find out I was wrong. The twists and turns were believable, sometimes horribly so, and I quite enjoyed how it all ended. A wonderfully written tear-jerker at times, but also part mystery with a love story thrown in (the love of a mother for her children and a husband for his wife).<br /><br />Put simply, I loved this book!
B007MDB71O|4.0|Disney Blu-rays are generally top notch in the transfer of quality, and this remains true for John Carter. Visually, this movie is truly stunning. The CGI and special effects are fantastic, and the various alien critters look really cool. It's true that the creature design is also a bit on the goofy side, but it works really well with the style of the movie. The locations that were chosen to film were excellent, and greatly resemble what I would imagine the red landscapes of Mars to look like.<br /><br />In terms of story, John Carter is very entertaining. I never read the novel (\\"A Princess of Mars\\"), so I can't say how true it is to the original source, but I liked the background for the protagonist. It's a very cool take to have him from the civil war era, and his background is fleshed out perfectly for the (very strange) task at hand. His experience with resiliency, combat, and surviving in vastly different cultures suits his unintended expedition on Mars perfectly. Furthermore, it's a clever trick to explain his rather remarkable abilities on Mars (super strength and crazy jumping) as a result of the difference in gravitational forces on Earth and Mars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the pace does start to get bogged down in the middle of the movie, which seems to happen far too often in the \\"epic movie\\" genre. But not to worry, it's not long before things pick up again, and John Carter finishes on a high note.

B006H5120E|5.0|It is not often you see a film whose convictions, dramatically and visually, match its ambitious intentions all the way through. Although it's been oft-parodied for years, James Cameron's eloquent, unforgettable 1997 Oscar-winner TITANIC (****, 194 mins., 1997, PG-13; Paramount) is one of those special films: an \\"epic\\" with an intimate, character-driven center, and a visual panache that truly makes one feel that you're right at home on the doomed ship itself. When the vessel meets its inevitable fate at the end, you feel the pain and horror along with the characters since Cameron has done such an amazing job balancing story with spectacle, paying proper respect and historically recounting the incident as accurately as he can, while still producing an entertainment - and, at times, a piece of art - that's been seldom duplicated by Hollywood in recent years.<br /><br />Part of the film's enduring appeal is due to the chemistry between Leonardo Dicaprio (outstanding) and Kate Winslet (excellent), who embody the film's admittedly old-fashioned, somewhat hokey but still compelling love story between the lower-class passenger and the upper-class rich girl slated to marry snobby tycoon Billy Zane. DiCaprio confirmed with his \\"Titanic\\" role why he was one of the top young actors of his generation, with an unpredictable yet earnest quality that informs his performance. The then-buxom Winslet is often captivating as the female lead, a role that often comes across as cliched and maybe a bit forced, yet she does such a fine job with it that it is hard to complain. Excellent supporting work abounds in this film, from Kathy Bates's Molly Brown to fine character turns by David Warner and Frances Fisher. The first half of the film is so good, in fact, that you forget the ship is on-course for the deadliest maritime disaster of the twentieth century.<br /><br />When the big event does arrive, Cameron treats us to a simply breathtaking dramatic display, the closest thing to a veritable rollercoaster (geometrically and otherwise) we've yet seen in the movies. The incident is awesomely conveyed in size and scope, with detailed special effects that haven't aged too badly. They masterfully assist Cameron in producing a meticulous recreation of the actual tragedy, with virtually every incident coming straight out of real-life accounts from survivors. (Indeed, Cameron frames shots that were supposed to have actually happened throughout the film. There is one moment early on where a young boy is spinning a top on the vessel's deck, a picture that originates from an Irish priest's photo of the Titanic in port at Belfast - one of the final photos ever taken of the ship. Clearly, Titanic scholars will find an incredible array of moments like those interpolated throughout the film, in addition to dialogue between some of the White Star line and crew members that also reportedly occurred in real life. Of course, not all of the film is historically accurate, yet that so much of it is speaks volumes about the director's attempts to balance art with authenticity).<br /><br />Like every great film, the cumulative whole of \\"Titanic\\"  is that of a true, bona-fide experience - the kind we hope to see every time we go to the movies. The picture stays with you long after the film has ended - yes, its relatively simple messages of living your life to its fullest, freed from the restrictions imposed by other individuals and society itself, may seem straightforward enough, yet Cameron's movie has a haunting resonance that is almost impossible to describe (part of this is due to James Horner's outstanding score).<br /><br />After it's over, you're left contemplating the immense significance of an almost incomprehensible event that has been broken down into pure human terms that apply to all of us. It's hard to think back on other movies that have left that much of an impression on viewers, which is why \\"Titanic\\"  is a movie whose cinematic legacy may live on as long asthe historical impact of the tragic sinking itself.<br /><br />Paramount has, at last, brought \\"Titanic\\" to Blu-Ray in a couple of different editions, the most notable being a 3-D Limited Edition combo pack. I didn't go to see the 3-D re-release in theaters, but there is no doubt that Cameron's attention to detail has resulted in one of the strongest 3-D conversions to date: there's scant ghosting, and plenty of depth-of-field, effects throughout here, with the picture playing more effectively in 3-D than you might've anticipated (note that the film has been split into two parts on the 3-D side). The 2-D version (contained on one disc), also included here, has been treated marvelously, with a razor sharp, natural looking 1080p AVC encoded transfer, while 5.1 DTS MA audio masterfully conveys an intricately mixed sound design that's as important to the film as the visuals themselves. It's a technical presentation as satisfying as you'd anticipate coming from Cameron and his Lightstorm Entertainment banner.<br /><br />Extra features include three commentaries on the 2-D Blu-Ray plus a bonus fourth disc of extras. These include the all-new \\"Reflections on Titanic\\" (an hour-long film retrospective, in HD, offering interviews with all of the major participants sans DiCaprio) and \\"Titanic: The Final Word With James Cameron,\\" a 96-minute special (also in HD) that originally aired on the National Geographic Channel earlier this year, with Cameron talking with various Titanic experts one last time about the ship's final night. Deleted scenes are also included, in full HD, with optional Cameron commentary that's been brought over from the 2005 DVD edition. A series of original production featurettes are also on tap, plus a full range of trailers and TV spots (left off that 2005 release), Titanic parodies and, of course, the Celine Dion video for \\"My Heart Will Go On.\\"<br /><br />It's a rich, outstanding package that's been assembled here by Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainmentand Paramount, with terrific extras and spectacular transfers -- no matter which version of \\"Titanic\\" you wish to revisit.

B005VR9328|5.0|This might be the best album they have ever put out.  Yes, its short, but musically, it is a great creation.  The CD is un-skippable.  This is the type of stuff rap music needs these days, and it won't ever sell 1 million copies thanks to its lack of 3rd grade xylephone music production.  The roots have had solid albums throughout the years, but this one rises to the top.  How I Got Over wasn't anywhere close to a great album by them, and this one resurrected their status as a legendary musical group.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Here's The Lowedown on \\"Battleship\\" (A Sci-Fi DVD review)...Loved IT!    Become a fan of The Lowedown on Facebook: [...]    Genre: 8 Movie: 6.5    What's it about?  Based on the classic Hasbro naval combat game, Battleship is the story of an international fleet of ships who come across an alien armada while on Naval war games exercise. An intense battle is fought on sea, land and air. What do the aliens want?    What did I think?  For the SCI-FI and F/X...this movie is worth a look.  This would have been one of my favorites of the year, had it not been for the corny reference to the game itself.  Other than that, it was \\"Top Gun\\" meets \\"Transformers\\".  I enjoyed the film, the character development, and the battle sequences.  Don't take the movie too seriously..just sit back and be entertained.  I bought it and have liked it more and more every time I see it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|3 excellent workouts.  Each about 27 minutes long (to include warm up and stretching at the end).  I'm in pretty good shape, and she really kicks my butt.

B0033H7VI6|5.0|Here is my review of the knife put simply. I bought mine to keep in my Bug Out Bag/ Go-Bag and the knife is heavy duty and strong and I feel it will last through a lot of abuse. I added some pictures as well to compare it to other popular knives and also the sizing compared to my hand.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The knife is under $40 and heavy duty<br />2. Easily can be used for batoning and other bushcraft.<br />3. Comes with a sheath, not the greatest but at least it comes with one.<br />4. Good grip which looks to be removable for lashing blade for bushcraft/hunting.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Made in TAIWAN, but at least its not China. You want made in U.S.A you got to pay starting at $50-60 for a KA-BAR.<br />2. Sheath is weak but can be beefed up with some better stitching or broken down to just plastic insert.<br />3. It is somewhat heavy but for a Go Bag or B.O.B its fine.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this knife because in the long run its $35, built well, comes very sharp, has a sheath that could be reinforced but works well for strapping to my Go Bag. I could buy 3 of these knives for the cost of the Buck Knifes, Ka-Bar or Ontario knives I was looking at which is great because I intend on using this but more so purchased for Emergency situations.

B004ZN9NCY|4.0|Ummagumma, Pink Floyd's fourth albume in 1969 is a little different than their latter works. The band hated this album (which I can understand) along with Atom Heart Mother (which I can't understand).<br /><br />Many fans said the live album is a lot better than the recorded studio album, which is true. The songs are double the length for the live version. Yet it's still enjoyable to listen. I think \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugen,\\" is the best live song.<br /><br />Now for the studio album, this is where you have to play most songs in order to start liking them. Richard Wright delievers \\"Sysyphus\\" in four different parts, which is a very weird start for the albume. A couple of these parts are just eerie and some sound more like \\"Quicksliver\\" from More. Like I said, you just have to keep playing these songs in order to like them.<br /><br />Roger delievers a song that any Pink Floyd fan should have, \\"Grantchester Meadows,\\" which is a very slow accoustic piece with Roger singing.<br /><br />Then he delievers yet again, with more of a comic twist, \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict.\\" The song is nothing but weird animal noises and Roger's voice in the background saying very wordless things, as if making his own speech. To be honest, this \\"song\\" made me laugh.<br /><br />David Gilmour gave us \\"The Narrow Way\\" in three parts, first two just music, while the third has lyrics. Part one is accostic with an eerie twist, while part two is more heavy with electric guitar. Part three should be enjoyable, and a must have for Pink Floyd fans. David gaves us weird and eerie lyrics and the musci is just brilliant.<br /><br />Last but not least, Nick Mason's turn with \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" in three parts.<br /><br />Part one \\"Entrance\\" is a short flute like song while part two \\"entertainment\\" deals with weird drums. Then the album finalyl closes with part three \\"Exit,\\" which is the same as \\"Entrance.\\"<br /><br />Just grow into the albume, and you'll likw it. But it shouldn't be on your top list until you really get to know and understand Pink Floyd. But nonetheless, it should go in your Pink Floyd collection.st grow into the albume, and you'll likw it.

B009329ZF2|4.0|Playing the game Battleship, as a child, I never thought of an alien enemy.  Thought provoking concept, and done very well in this 'game gone movie' flick.  Even with the length of the movie, I think that quite a bit more should have been used to explain the nature of the aliens.  Maybe we could have learned more about the history of the enemy.  All in all, if you can turn off your 'that could never happen' attitude for 2 hours and 12 minutes, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The CGI was excellent, and the acting was just as cool.  I really kind of have hopes for a sequel!

B0058YPGSY|5.0|I had never really seen much of this series in the past, but after watching this I have already looked into the first three seasons to catch up on what I missed. This is an action packed show and in this season you are kept on the edge of your seat in every episode (or at least I was). I was impressed with the overall acting within the show itself and the relationships between the characters were very solid. As I said before there is plenty of action in the series, but you also will find drama and even if you are not into the motorcycle scene, you will still find a lot to enjoy about the series. There are definitely references to biking culture that you have to catch onto, but you can catch on quite quickly and once you do it is smooth sailing!

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I am a fan of the recent fairy tale movies that have been coming out. So I did see Mirror Mirror, and now I have watched this. This was definitely a much different look at the Snow White story. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth did an amazing job in their roles within the movie. Both actors made me believe that they were their characters and they did a great job at this altogether. Kristin Stewart on the other hand would not have been my pick for her character. Not that she didn't fit the role, she did, but whether she was believable in this role she really was not in my perspective (but I would say similar things to her portrayal in the Twilight series as well). Overall, the movie was engaging and though darker than other fairy tale movies, it was action packed and fun. Overall, I enjoyed this, though the acting by Ms. Stewart could have been stronger.

B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|This movie was so much fun for the whole family! For anyone who loved the original Lorax, this is a new spin to a classic tale. The makers of the film have made a beautiful film that is visually stunning. The colors simply jump off the screen and the characters are fun loving and memorable (Grandma is hilarious). I love the underlying theme of the movie that surrounds caring for the planet. This was an underlying theme of the book too, but the movie hit it home even harder which was great and I had a great conversation with my kids about the importance of this after the movie was done and you can do the same! All-in-all this was a wonderful film that added much to the original story and with a great message, this is definitely a movie I would share with all families!
B000002JR8|5.0|In 1994 I was 18 yo...Me and my best friend lived together and was spending every weekend drinking beer and listening to metal. I remember the day this album came out very well. We both didnt work that day and we went to our record store and bought 2 cds of Far beyond Driven. We listened to it like 20 times in a row, and a 24 pack each of course. We never thought that Pantera could make a better record than Vulgar Display Of Power, but they did. Far Beyond Driven crushes everything they ever did. This album makes me really feel Stronger than All. You cant call yourself a metalfan if you dont own this album.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I have been a fan of Claire Danes for some time, but have not seen her in much lately, so I was intrigued to see how she would do as a CIA agent, as it is not her normal role that she has played in the past. She did an amazing job in her role, and I also have to say that I loved to see Mandy Patinkin again as he always does an amazing job in any role that he takes on and in his guest role he definitely lived up to this as well.<br /><br />I was quite impressed with the season and will look forward to the next season, as this one left me anxious to find out what will happen next. The series is full of action, suspense and drama, a great combination in my perspective.<br /><br />If you like a series that is full of intense, edge of your seat action, as well as strong acting and characters, this is definitely the series for you!

B003VANOFY|1.0|these headphones are bad news. avoid them.<br /><br />first, the default software had to be replaced (the volume button didn't work correctly, the hotkeys were hijacking the controls, and the headset likes to turn itself off at random moments for no reason, like it just idles out)...<br /><br />so with the new software, volume button works. but now exists new problems. sometimes the headset will just start buzzing horrible loud noise that will not cease. i've had to unplug them from the pc and let them sit a while before trying to plug them back in. the buzzing even continued after unplugging them from the pc... so i unplugged them from the battery charger too. this is a ridiculous problem to have, and it happens frequently.<br /><br />also, the power button doesn't work too great. i've tried tapping it, holding it down for several seconds, holding it down until i see a power button... its just doesn't turn on when you click the power button. usually takes 20 seconds for the light to finally pop on.<br /><br />and in the case of the buzzing sound, the power button will just shut itself off if you try to turn it on after its been buzzing and you shut it down (hence why i have to just leave it alone for a while and try again later).<br /><br />not sure i want a replacement. i'd rather choose another headset, possibly one that doesn't use USB.

0525478817|5.0|I'm not a person who likes Oprah books about murdered children or Nicholas Sparks books with a Requisite Tragedy. I choose my angst with care.<br />And I'm glad I chose this.<br />This book is sharp and funny and unsentimental, while being utterly true.<br />Everyone is likable, even if they are a mess.<br />And it has, I think, the best set of parents since A Wrinkle in Time.<br /><br />\\"Oh, I wouldn't mind, Hazel Grace. It would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you.\\"

B008GJV8BW|2.0|One of the top rated reviews states that this is the smart mans version of Casino or the Godfather. I don't think so.... First the worst part is the soundtrack. It's a laughable Disney soundtrack. Second, the characters are also Disney-like in that they are so freaking cliche. Lastly, it doesn't have a smart twist at the end. I loved \\"No Country for Old Men\\" but for this to be a Cohen brothers movie... I feel embarrassed for them. Not worth the 2.99 rental.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Ordinary game not to special but a good time passer for bus rides or times when your bored. 4 stars because it works and it serves its purpose well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book ever! I LOVED IT! Although a few of my favourite characters died, I still loved the actionfilled rebellion it entails. But it still begs the question, what happened to Gale???????

B004QL7K8E|3.0|I got a kick out of one movie source listing this confection as \\"Science Fiction & Fantasy.\\"  That seems crazy but yeah I get it.  Certainly none of this would likely happen, certainly not on this scale.  I'm reminded of the 1983 Tom Cruise classic, \\"Risky Business\\" except that movie actually had a purpose, a story and some likeable characters.  Like this film RB featured a party, an expensive car in the water and a pair of potential love birds.<br /><br />In Project X, high school student Thomas (Thomas Mann) an otherwise sober kid is convinced to have a party at his house on his birthday while his parents are conveniently out of town for the week-end.  His best friends Costa (Oliver Cooper) and Miles (Miles Teller) invite everyone they know and thousands they don't thanks to the internet.  The whole thing is filmed by another friend (Dax Flame) in yet another take on the \\"found footage\\" theme.  Actually I thought that worked pretty well for a change.  The camera guy actually didn't have to run for his life while remaining committed to keep on filming.  Here he didn't want to miss a stray boob.<br /><br />By boob I mean the fleshy, perfectly formed ones that are attached to nubile young ladies.  On that front there is no shortage.  The party devolves into one giant booze fest with what appears to be indifferent neighbors but for one and a seemingly powerless, ineffective Pasadena police force.  I guess the filmmakers hit their target and I suspect plenty of Blu ray players will have worn out pause buttons as a result.  Me?  I'll take \\"Risky Business.\\"
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book immediately had my attention and I could not put it down... I really enjoyed it. The characters were very interesting. I do have to agree that the author seemed to bail out at the end. Its like when you have a sneeze coming and your nose tickles and you are waiting for it... and then nothing. But I am not sorry I read it.
B0085HWZDK|5.0|After former Led Zeppelin front man Plant ended a brief but successful pairing with bluegrass star Alison Krauss he formed this Band of Joy named after an early pre-Zep collaboration from the 1960's.  This time he includes several heavyweights into the mix including singer/guitarist/songwriter Patty Griffin, guitarist/singer and producer extraordinaire Buddy Miller, singer and player of anything with strings Darrell Scott, bassist Byron House and drummer/percussionist Marco Giovino.<br /><br />This band is like a perfect cocktail.  One part country, one part blues, one part gospel, one part soul and fill the glass with rock `n roll.  Plant still has what it takes but he no longer screeches and screams.  His musical taste is perfecto with 6 or 7 Led Zep songs (out of 16) that sound brand new given the great arrangements.  Each band member is given a chance to shine and they all do.  Pay special attention to Miller when he gets a guitar solo (often).  He's as good as anybody in the business.<br /><br />This concert was filmed in Nashville at the War Memorial Auditorium by the TV program \\"Live from the Artist Den.\\" The disc includes a brief tribute to the venue and very brief interviews between some of the songs.  The concert itself is a too brief 77 minutes and features a PCM Stereo or DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  I saw this group when they first got together a couple years ago.  Don't miss them if you have a chance.  If not pick up this great concert.

1610390938|3.0|The book is great. Very interesting. Can be used as introduction materials to someone who has never touched on development economics before. But the margins are quite small.
B004MKLRQA|1.0|This book was extremely irritating to read. This poorly written book explains a young boys journey through war. Being forced to read this for a grade is a ridiculous decision on my teachers part. I have to come up with 5 interesting activities he did per chapter...can't do it. I had all summer to read this but at 72 days I'm only at chapter 5 and hate every bit of it. How this book got any good reviews is beyond me. Don't get me wrong I enjoy reading and I feel for what this boy had to go thorough but seriously the way the story is told SUCKS! I even bought this book on tape but fell asleep 3times. Its slow and confusing with grammar errors. Maybe I should write my report on the spelling errors and bad grammar. I am told this is a great heroic story but I can not get past how boring it is to read. I asked my mother (a college Communications and English Lit. instructor) to read this book but she refused. She told me to read it and form my own opinion. I already had an opinion and told her what it was. She then confirmed my opinion was hers as well.<br />If you must read this book then I feel for you but if you want to read it check it out from your library before you purchase it. Try to read and understand it. There is a good story here just not represented well in the way this book was written.
B0057RCFQS|4.0|It was really fun to let my kids watch the movies for the first time. Watching it with them made it seem new to me too.
0684803356|3.0|Not really a review, but hoping readers of this book can clarify. I'm reading the Kindle edition and note that the word \\"unprintable\\" and \\"obscenity\\" are written in place of well, swear words. Is this Hemingway? Or am I reading an edited version of the book? I'd prefer not to read an edited book. I can't seem to find an answer to this question online. Anyone know the answer? (Kindle user can do a search on \\"obscenity\\" and \\"unprintable\\" to call up what I'm talking about.) Thanks in advance for any clarity on this.

B00493E1GI|5.0|This is a woman's unique journey of learning how to love out of generosity, not sacrifice.<br /><br />Gilbert, like so many young American women, commit themselves too early to a direction/relationship in life. After all she grew up in a very traditional, middle class, mid-western family (who often define happiness as a traditional marriage and planted lifestyle in your 20s). And she held onto to this life for a long time, because like all women, she didn't want to hurt anyone. But many young American women need to figure out who they are before committing to a husband and a life. This takes time and emotional maturity many women are taught to believe they do not have.<br /><br />Why? Building a life not based on your unique passions and understanding of the kind of husband who is right for you is frankly...wrong.  This means you will spend your life loving others by giving from your root and not your fruit. And in the long run, yes it hurts us, but it ALWAYS HURTS OUR LOVED ONES.<br /><br />Gilbert married into the wrong relationship for her. She couldn't accept him as he was. She was dependent on him being someone he wasn't.  When we don't feel good about ourselves and our lives, we struggle to love others well. \\"Do you feel my love for you?\\" as Elizabeth said. So by the time most women hit their 30s, they realize living a life where you're tolerating misery isn't good for anyone.<br /><br />Truly loving people means there are no strings attached...because believe in the authenticity of our love for them BASED ON HOW WE LOVE OURSELVES. When we are content and at peace with ourselves, then we can really GIVE to others without NEEDING back from them.  That's how our love empowers others...which is the greatest way to live.<br /><br />But to change your life so you give from your fruit and not your root is often a MESS.  But Gilbert had the courage to do it.  If she had not let her husband go, he wouldn't have had the chance to make a happier life. What a risky, loving, and brave thing to do.<br /><br />So I find the principles in Eat Pray Love incredibly relateable to every woman who decides to un-compromise her life for the sake of making the world a better place.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best of all of the free Bible apps available for the Kindle Fire. The daily devotional plans are a real motivation to get into Gods word and start the morning off right.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the reminders, studies, and various options. I highly recommend this if you find yourself on the go or just busy with life in general. It's a great way to stay faithful in reading God's Word.

1469984202|5.0|I bought this book based on the number of high level reviews, and I can't say enough, I am not sorry I did - this is one of the most riveting, well written and crafted stories I've read in a long time.  Almost anything I say may give away something of the story, so I'll just recommend - read the first two books before coming to any judgement - then you will be hooked. Thank you Mr. Howey for an excellent piece of work.
0374214913|3.0|Our hero, Clay, a graphic artist and fan of a fantasy series, stumbles upon a bizarre, narrow bookstore in San Francisco and lands a job as a night clerk. There, he encounters a trickle of bizarre customers who seem only to trade books rather than buy them. Through his connections to his roommates, a childhood friend and a cute girl who stumbles in the store, Clay embarks on a quest to solve the riddles posed by these mysterious volumes and the store's owner, Mr. Penumbra. The novel combines the complexity of contemporary computing with a love for books; the novel represents an elaborate puzzle, and we join Clay in the pursuit of the solution. Overall, the novel is short and entertaining; a job at Google and thirst for immortality give Clay's girlfriend depth beyond the SF manic-pixie dream girl we expect. The novel deals with the whole inforg issue in a roundabout way -- how old knowledge can be sought and informed by the massive abilities of computer-based information processing as well as the human imagination. Everything ties together. If the riddle at the center of the novel isn't quite as mysterious or interesting as the riddles in other examples of the genre (think Shadow of the Wind, The Thirteenth Tale or The Magician King), nevertheless you still enjoy getting there.
B001FB4W0C|4.0|Can't say anything negative...so far, every disk (that I have watched so far) is without error. Item arrived timely!

1476712042|2.0|I was very curious about this one, mostly because I had read so many contradictory reviews that I wanted to find out where I stood in the matter. That said, many thanks to NetGalley and to Atria Books for providing me with a copy of Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />This book tells the story of a young woman, Abby, who goes to college and there she meets Travis Maddox, the bad boy of the place - you know, shaved head, lots of tattoos, a fighter, and most of all, a playboy. Against all odds the two end up becoming best friends, but everyone -except Abby-- can see that their relationship is so much more.<br /><br />Travis can't stand when Abby goes on a date, when guys talk to her, or even look her way, and he always does something about it, like punch the date/talker/observer straight in the face. Abby complains but deep down inside she loves it, she loves that Travis is so territorial and protective of her, so why not face the situation and just date the guy? Well, Abby has a quite mysterious past, which she slowly lets the reader know along the story, but the main problem is: she doesn't want to be romantically involved with a guy who kind of reminds her of her father when it comes to vices -- all the drinking, and the easy money that comes from the fights, not to mention she knows about the tons of girls he has slept with and discarded in the morning.<br /><br />That's when the \\"beautiful disaster\\" part comes in, because despite all of Abby's fears, they become a couple for real and all is great until it isn't anymore. Of course this wasn't a surprise for me, since they become a couple around page 200, and my copy was 400 pages long, so I figured I was still in for A LOT of drama - and I wasn't wrong.<br /><br />Abby and Travis will breakup, start over, breakup, start over, to the point of driving their friends to breakup, they'll have to face demons from their pasts, go to Vegas, make deals with dangerous people, breakup again, go through hell while apart, try one more time, fail, fail, fail, until SUCCESS!<br /><br />I'll admit I got to a point where I just wanted them to please stop, please just stay together, I just can't anymore, PLEASE! And honestly the writing could use some grooming, BUT for some reason since the moment I started I couldn't stop reading, I needed to know how Abby and Travis's story was going to end.<br /><br />I can't say Beautiful Disaster is a great book, that the plot is original, that the writing is flawless, or that the hero and heroine are the best main characters around, but I can say that this was one of those addictive, impossible to stop, just-leave-me-alone-I-need-to-finish-this readings, and in my book that's always a positive thing.ore time, fail, fail, fail, until SUCCESS!<br /><br />I'll admit I got to a point where I just wanted them to please stop, please just stay together, I just can't anymore, PLEASE!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is the second in a series of the Hunger Games.  Because of the type of storyline I really didn't expect to like the book, but after reading the Hunger Games, book #1, I ordered the two subsequent books in the series.  Catching Fire continued so smoothly from the first book, that is was a pleasure to read on with the story.  The author, Suzanne Collins, certainly has the knack of keeping her story running smoothly and even though it was  more futuristic I really did get caught up in the life of Katnis and her family and the life that they were living. I get my books for my Kindle and I really enjoyed being able to go from one book to the next with just a touch of my finger!
B0087HT36U|5.0|love this game! cannot wait for the next installment because I can never seen to put it down. on my kindle or ipod
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book of The Hunger Games series, MOCKINGJAY, leads us  through the last adventure of Katniss, the heroine of the series.  Suzanne Collins, the talented author of this series, never shirked her duty of leading the reader on through the fights, deaths, loves and reuniting that gave me the full view of the life that people in those 12 districts led.  While the terror and bloodshed that the Tributes had to deal with,  was gory but never too gory, and while it was so life-like it still didn't make me want to put the book down and not continue reading.  All in all I loved the series, each book blended into the one before and they never were boring, there was always some new twist that made things take a sharp turn to another adventure.  The twists and turns that happened to the lives of Katniss and her family, although they were seperated and at some point lived apart, they were always loving and understanding of that persons inner feelings.  A truly great book, and a great series.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Almost didn't get this book after the first one seemed to be \\"acceptable\\" porno. My daughter recommended I read it though and I'm glad I did. The story of why/how Christian came to be was interesting. The story had some twists, mystery, excitement to it. AND the third book is the BEST!

1402270275|5.0|In London, Honoria Todd hides in the dangerous Whitechapel slums from the Echelon as she tries to keep her siblings safe and alive.  However, anyone foolish or desperate enough to enter Whitechapel must deal with the master of this slum Blade, infected with the identical vampiric virus as the Echelon.<br /><br />Blade lives to destroy the beast who changed him.  When he realizes that same monster pursues the Todd trio, he decodes innocent Honoria would be a perfect lure.  However, the one problem with his otherwise sacrificial scheme is he also needs her blood.  All changes when a monster enters Whitechapel, as Blade will do anything including letting her go to keep his beloved Honoria (and her siblings) safe.<br /><br />Kiss of Steel is an enjoyable steampunk horror thriller starring a vivid radically different London and two seemingly opposite protagonists.  Fast-paced, readers will root for the brave intelligent heroine while unsure of the motives of the master of Whitechapel.  Filled with action and especially vile villains with the one being particularly evil, fans will enjoy Bec McMaster's strong opening act.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0785116885|4.0|I did wonder what happened to the Hulk's Warbound after he was taken into custody, and this did a really good job of filling in the gaps.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />So apparently the Warbound are all hiding under the streets of NYC as SHIELD is hunting them.  Later they are teleported from NYC to Gamma World in New Mexico where they fight The Leader and his minions.<br /><br />They of course win but some of the humans can only see them for the \\"monsters\\" that they appear to be and not the saviors and heroes that they truly are.  It's a little old and tired, but I guess if creatures like this showed up in the real world this is how we would view them, no matter how much good they did.<br /><br />In the end the main SHIELD agent that was pursuing them turns into a super being of her own and is able to channel the \\"Old Power,\\" like one of the Warbound can. which is pretty cool.<br /><br />Another interesting part was that all through this, SHIELD has people interrogating Miek trying to get him to give them to get dirt on the Warbound to find their weaknesses.  It's really good cuz this gives us more info on their back stories and we find out what drives these characters other than their undying loyalty to the Hulk.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />This was pretty good and I'm glad I picked it up.  The only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is the fact that the Hulk is only on a few pages and in there he just shows up in the background and doesn't say anything.<br /><br />Check it out!
B004HO6I2E|4.0|This movie is raunchy, predictable, crude, and completely unoriginal but it's also hilarious. My wife and both laughed out loud.

1612183956|5.0|....and a surprise is what I got. I can always count on Blake Crouch for a kick A narrative and a plot with more twist and turns than a rollercoaster! I have read a few of his novels as well as some he has co-authored. Pines is completely different from his other works. Proving for me, that Mr. Crouch is blazing a trail of his own for others to follow. In this story Ethan Burke, a Secret Service Agent is sent to the town of Wayward Pines to locate or find out what happened to two other Agents that were now missing. Upon entering the town, Ethan and his partner are involved in a horrific car accident. Ethan comes to in a hospital to learn that his partner is dead. However, this is only the beginning of his nightmare. Wayward Pines is not at all what it seems. On the surface it looks like the perfect town. Deep down Ethan knows that something is not right and that he has to get out....I thought I had this mystery figured out more than once. I was wrong. Blake Crouch has a far reaching imagination and the talent to take us there.

0061726834|4.0|When people turn 18 they've procedure to cure themfrom a disease called love, or amor deliria nervosa. Love is the reason that made evything to turn into chaos and a cure was developed. The feeling of love for a best friend, a parent, or a pet is not tolerated.<br /><br />Lena can't wait for her procedure but then she meets Alex. At first she's horrified at the feelings she now has but slowly starts to question the way of life. She has always wanted to be happy and ordinary and the procedure is the answer to that. But what if there is another way?<br /><br />I haven't read many dystopian books before and I'm surprised how much I liked this. And I think the idea of love thought as disease is interesting.<br /><br />It started little slowly but things starts to go swiftly little by little. I actually liked Lena. At first she is rather insecure and feels like she is in her best friend Hana's shadow. Hana is the type that catches all the attention at first and then there is Lena's mother's suicide that still cast a shadow on Lena's life. I loved to see that Alex made her start believing in herself more. But when Lena's procedure starts to approach she starts to think about running off with Alex .<br /><br />While I liked the book there was few things that bothered me. I would have liked to learn why the government suddenly started to force everyone to be cured. It was said love and feelings was the reason for wars and that people were unhappy but I kept thinking if there was something that really set things off.<br /><br />And it's said that it's dangerous to take the procedure before you turn 18 because of side effects but then later on we're told that some people who has gotten the deliria is forced to take procedure earlier. It kinda came out like it's a normal thing when just before it's stated to be dangerous.<br /><br />But all in all it was fascinating reading and I'm looking forward reading more of her books!

014132855X|3.0|It was not great but I liked it better than the first 2 books. I think Rose has grown a little. She's still ckinda childish but atleast she's not so slutty anymore...<br />At first I was little annoyed about the useless drama she created because she wouldn't say what was going on. And it's irritating how she thinks Dimitri is perfect and can't do anything wrong. I'm still icky about their age difference, or more like of their mental age difference. Dimitri is too mature for his age and Rose too childish for hers. But I've started to like Adrian more.
0345410025|5.0|I'm in my 30's and possess an advanced degree - I am no stranger to studying and mnemonics.  I wish now that I had found this book and invested some time in it's methods years ago.  After minimal study of this book and maybe an hour of work (just for fun) I memorized all 50 states in order of admission to the union and can recite them forwards, backwards or by number.  I can also quickly calculate in my head what day of the week any calendar day is for the upcoming year.  These small feats would have taken many hours of study without this system.  Great read for students or anyone who wants a more robust memory.

The venue is a circus that arrives without notice and opens only after sun goes down. But what their mentors did not take into account was that they might fall in love.<br /><br />I'm so happy I finally decided to read this because I loved it! Before I started it I wasn't sure about the whole circus thing but it worked here.<br /><br />This isn't action packed but it still managed to be not boring. The time changes were little confusing at first but I got used to them,<br /><br />I loved Marco's and Celia's relationship but it could have felt more closer if they would haven spent more time together. There were years when they had no contact with each other which meant many chapters with no contact. I loved seeing them growing closer and learning more about their magic and what they're capable doing with it. It was interesting to see  Celia building some kind of relationship with her father and what kind of person it made her.<br /><br />I have to say I never really got the meaning of this duel. I mean there was never any real confrontation between the players and it seemed like they never really did anything besides creating a new tent. Yes those were some special and cool tents but still. And how does that kind of duel really end? What makes the winner a winner? But that would be my biggest complain that the world would have been better explained.<br /><br />But I really loved the book and it was a great debut. Can't wait to read more of her books!
034580404X|5.0|Read it twice. Love it for its diversion factor. I'm 40 and have gone back to school. I work hard and love the escape it provides. My husband loved me reading it too;)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so glad that I did not let a few negative reviews deter me from downloading this app! If you love Pinterest you will not be sorry. I have NOT had a single problem and love to Pinterest from my Kindle. I actually prefer the Kindle over My laptop for Pinterest. I would 100% recommend you to download! :)
B003ITZBVS|5.0|I'm a huge Batman fan from the comics to the old animated series to all the live-action films. Yes, I believe that even with the Nolan films considered, this is the best Batman film.<br /><br />It's basically the Red Hood comic storyarc in animated feature format, but somehow it actually seems to work better in animation than in the comics. The dialogue just works so much better spoken than read in this case, I dunno.<br /><br />The action choreography is by FFAAAARRRRRR the best out of any Batman film, bar-none. If you're a fan of \\"punchy\\" Batman you'll love this. If you're more into the detective stories, this may not satisfy as much (I'm actually a fan of the detective stories, so that tells you how amazing the action was in this one).
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I think this was a great game :) fun, challenging, and exciting. Even though I think the ending could have ben better it was still a grate game.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This game has puzzles, hidden objects, and multistep problem solving games all in one. It's a great game,  multifaceted and engaging.
0525478817|5.0|It might have been stated, but I did not see that it was hardcover... I thought it was paperback. Also it was delivered in 10 days, much to my surprise. (:
B004X60QE2|5.0|Completely hooked. Eureka is a great show and fun to watch. The DVD shipped fast but, one of the disks was loose and showed signs of rubbing. No issues with the disk as it worked perfectly.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love it and the other great thing is you don't have to spend any money in the game like some other games.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This is just what I needed to get out of the rat race. Every household should have a copy of this book!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I loved this movie! Yes, the story may not have been the most original out there, but it was a well done story nevertheless. Emotionally, it was a grabber. Visually, it was stunning. Technically, it was created by leaps and bounds into new technologies that hadn't been tried before. As many times as I've watched it, I never fail to be moved by it.<br /><br />I was one of those who rushed out to buy the film when it first came out. Two years later, I bought the extended BluRay version and I'm thrilled I did. Watching the actors create these characters with the use of minimal props, seeing the stunt work that went into creating the humanoid movement of the Na 'vi, the blank canvas that was the studio ... everything about the production end of the movie gave me a much greater appreciation for what the movie did accomplish.<br /><br />Bashing? There are those who find great pleasure in tearing apart. They will find fault no matter how great a film or show might be. These people have no understanding of what goes into the production of a film, especially one of this capacity. I don't hold much sway wiith their criticisms because very little of it is  constructive.<br /><br />If you want to really see some of what goes on behind the scenes, the extended BluRay version is well worth the money.
1439152799|5.0|Quite by chance, thirty something book editor Edie Burchill discovers that her mother, twelve years old at the start of WWII, was evacuated to ancient Milderhurst Castle in Kent. Since her mom vehemently refuses to talk about it, Edie sets off to discover why. She travels to Milderhurst and arranges for a tour, where she meets the now elderly - and eccentric - Blythe sisters, daughters of famous author Raymond Blythe. A strong sense of deja vu overtakes her during her visit to the decaying edifice, and she reluctantly departs with more questions than answers. When a few weeks later Edie's offered an opportunity to write the preface to a new edition of Blythe's The True History of the Mudman, her favorite childhood novel, she eagerly accepts, and finds herself immersed in a tangled web of mystery.<br /><br />Narrated from multiple viewpoints, The Distant Hours is an outstanding example of modern gothic fiction. It contains all the requisite elements, from spooky setting and enigmatic characters to madness, tragic accidents, and murky mysteries. Author Morton commendably restrains herself from going over the top, never sacrificing subtlety for blatant effect. This is prose that captivates. Slightly reminscent in style of duMaurier's Rebecca, Hours is just as compulsively readable and memorable. The truth very gradually yields itself up to Edie's relentless research, not to mention courage, with the biggest surprise - shocking yet wholly believable - withholding itself until the very end.<br /><br />This is a writer who keeps getting better. On my list of top five reads of 2012.

B002LVVCQM|5.0|Wow.  What a great read.  Even if you think you have a good understanding of the details of evolution, this book will likely shed new and breath-taking light on this intricate- if a little clumsy- process.  Occasionally, Dawkins has trouble resisting the urge to (respectfully) stick his tongue out at creationists, but as I'm on his side, I didn't mind.  ;-)  This is likely one of the most significant books I have ever read, in that it has opened my eyes even wider than they were previously.  I now have a much better understanding of this natural process. What a wonderfully complex and fascinating universe we live in.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a beautiful story.  It will break your heart, over and over, but it will more than heal it in the process!
B004RZGUBM|4.0|Well, It's hard to add anything significant about the book collection, besides the title. If I remember correctly, it cost me about 3$, and it does what it's supposed to do: include The Complete works of Charles Dickens, with illustrations.<br /><br />Only tiny downsides are the occasional \\"together-spelling\\" and that the images was small and wouldnt rotate in the direction I was reading, so it was always 90 deg off. (None of them at all important, but slightly annoying).<br /><br />All in all, a splendid offer all things considered (Worth more than 10 times the money IMO).
B00368PSN2|5.0|I have sometimes been misled by very favorable reviews of DVDs. This one is exceptional! Have watched it time and again. Friends who have watched it with me agree and have recommended it to others.

He loved it, at first - yet read on please.<br /><br />The the right ear speaker went out in June 2012.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book held my attention with all of its twists and turns. It was well written and had great plot and character development.
159413586X|5.0|All 3 books are amazing. I'm actually sad that I'm done reading them. The whole series makes you think of how t.v manipulates reality. Such a great trilogy.
B003INBNXO|5.0|A great movie. The first movie features how hard it was for Ip Man to become how he was. This movie shows a lot of great martial arts move and great fighting scenes.
B005L12SB2|5.0|Vinyl Confessions  .....<br /><br />Got the oversea copy shipped quick, and the price was right.<br />The Good; Monolith, Audio Visions, by far the best work that had not been remastered.<br />The Bad; CD label does not match vinyl artwork, which is part of the record. Also the sleeve artwork and lyrics are missing.<br />Other than that this is a complete must have KANSAS, just add \\"Somewhere to Elsewhere\\" \\"Always Never the Same\\" and \\"In the Spirit of Things\\" and you pretty much have Everything KANSAS.  For a Band that the artwork is remembered as much as the music I can understand the complains about the packaging.  But as the Song goes...<br /><br />The MUSIC is All for you (not the packaging)<br />It's really all we got to Share
B004I1AGTC|5.0|This Movie shows how IP Man got his respect and how he became a great teacher of martial arts. Great sequal to the first IP Man Movie.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love the Pinterest app but it needs work. Force closes alot!! Sometimes it doesn't want to load and I get a white screen....which ends up force closing. Have to reload a second time, and sometimes even a third.  If these things could be fixed it would get 5 stars. When it DOES work, it's great little app!
B003CN4R74|2.0|\\"Evanescence\\" by Evanescence starts out with the very strong \\"What You Want\\".  \\"What You Want\\" is very good and symbolizes hope.  The rest of the songs were much more quiet and solemn. Her voice quality comes through, but the rest of the songs sound like she may have been under pressure to release the cd quickly.  I originally found out about her when I was stationed in Japan and heard her music being played where I sleep.  Music from her \\"Fallen\\" cd was played on the radio frequently during the time I lived in California. My husband also owned her \\"Fallen\\" cd and I enjoyed \\"My Immortal\\" from it the most.  It is hard for me to say that I would gently recommend checking out her cd from a library first before deciding whether or not to buy it. However, I do wish her continued happiness and intend to give my copy to a local library for Evanescence fans and/or anyone else curious to check out the cd.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have always loved this kind of puzzle games. The art and the interface are very well done, easy to use, and the game is a blast.
B007XHWROK|2.0|\\"Believe\\" by Justin Bieber starts out with the catchy and fun \\"All Around The World\\" featuring Ludacrais.  \\"Boyfriend\\" and \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" are also ok.  I decided to give this cd a chance because of his strong singing and good music video for the \\"Baby\\" song.  I was only hoping that the rest of the musical tunes would follow in the similar carefree energy as \\"All Around The World\\" and \\"Boyfriend\\".  This cd is more for those who are already Justin Bieber fans and/or those who enjoy teen-pop.  I admit that I plan on sending the cd to a local library so that Bieber fans and/or those who like teen-pop may have a chance to hear the cd.  With that said, I would only recommend the cd if you truly love \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" and/or teen-pop.  However, I do still agree with those that believe that he has a lasting career in the entertainment arena and has the potential to release more creative songs in the future.
0618871713|5.0|This is only the second graphic novel I've ever read, so my basis for critique is limited. That being said, I really, really enjoyed Fun Home. Thoughts:<br /><br />Positive<br />- The honesty. It's hard to write about yourself and your family.<br />- The coming-of-age aspect. Given the fact that it's in a newer-to-me format makes it even more intriguing.<br />- The father-daughter relationship. No matter what you're story they're complex.<br />- The humor. There's a dry wit to the book that's appealing,<br />- The quirk. Nothing is random, but everything is different.<br /><br />Is it for everyone? Nope. But if you have an open mind you'll love it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally able to enjoy pinning on my Kindle.  This app has bade all the difference.  I also have thus app For my Froissart 4 and am very happy with it.

B008M34INW|5.0|Rare original coming out of Hollywood, unlike most hollywood movies, especially action movies, this was a unique and not obvious story. Good acting, and the movie did not take itself too serioulsy
B002EE583O|5.0|For those who missed Madchester period, a good way to discover one of the 10th best album of the past century.
B00843TZJM|1.0|I can understand their voices not being what they were 40 years ago, but to not take care to record them properly is well, ludicrous... or to be blunt, a major f*** up.<br /><br />Their voices sound thin and tinny. Amazing that these guys still don't know how to work a mike after 40 years, and the producer was obviously asleep at the wheel. Ok, so let's tweek the center channel to smooth them out and bring them up front a bit more. Never happen. This bluray is only a 2 channel mix, so there are NO controls for center channel balance.<br /><br />For the fans only....I have better recorded versions of everything on here that I prefer to remember them by.

B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This movie has been way over-rated. The acting was subpar, special effects weren't that good, and the make-up looks like it was ripped off from Alice in Wonderland. Glad I waited to see it on video.

B000FC1MM8|5.0|To me, The Last Coyote is one of the best of the Michael Connelly books. It takes Harry Bosch, at one point, to Florida in search of the killer. Little does Harry know that he has already interacted with the killer and the killer is the last one he suspects as the killer. The analogy between the coyote and Bosch is done well and stays throughout the book. All in all, a great read.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Nice sequel to the 1st game. I Like the fact that you get to take time and actually see the hint as it is being given.

034580404X|5.0|I have to tell you, the story line was very good. Yet, eventually, I flipped through the intimate parts. It seems the wind just had to blow and they were engrossed with each other. In the first book, those scenes were gut churning. By book three they were anticipated and redundant plot line. I highly recommend reading the series.

B005HETDNY|3.0|This episode raises a few interesting questions and serves as an allegory for veterans. While it was interesting watching the prisoner run around the Enterprise and the crew largely unable to capture him, I kept thinking to myself \\"with all that technology, they can't apprehend this guy on their own ship?\\". There were a few moments as well when I was thinking \\"ok, what's the point\\". But again, we see Picard's humanity appear, as he clearly asserts his authority to reject the planet's request for Federation membership based on the fact that veterans of a war have been cast off inhumanely.<br /><br />Interesting episode overall.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book. You take a man that has an abusive past and a woman that has very low self-esteem and are reading them in their disfunction that is a by-product of their very unhealthy childhoods.  It's disturbing. I was under the impression that the book was going to be an exciting, fun read that would possibly ignite some further passion into my personal life or the very least give some good ideas for my girlfriends and I to discuss to regards to helping ourselves and our husbands have more fun.<br /><br />Instead, I was disturbed, upset and disgusted about the fact that this book has been given the credit to do those things. I was sad for Mr. Grey and wanted to tell the woman to grow a back bone and walk a way once she discovered that he is abusive and controlling. That is Not a personality we should become excited about or even condone.  It is not to say to limit what you want to do in the bedroom to keep things exciting. By all means, spank away if that is what turns you on. But when it stems from abuse or neglect as a child that has never gotten the help or proper therapy they need, it is not only sad, but angering that the media became so excited in what seemed like a mis-representation of this book.
B005HETV4K|4.0|This is an episode that echoes themes that many great writers have at one time or another explored. I think the most obvious example would be Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible'. However, in this episode, the accused don't aimlessly point at others in an attempt to save themselves, and that's what makes this story a bit different. This is especially true as Picard is put on the stand. What really caught my attention was how Picard looks out after his people. He is portrayed here as genuinely concerned about those under his command, no matter how far in rank. He personally sits down with a Crewmember 1st class to get to know the man accused by the visiting retired admiral. Also, Picard is the only one to speak up against what is going on with these baseless accusations. In this episode, you can see how Picard sticks with his integrity and beliefs no matter who he alienates in the process.
0439023521|5.0|Katniss is sixteen, but she has yet to experience the slightest intimacy beyond a familial kiss. As the oldest child in the family, she is tasked with the unenviable job of providing for her mother and younger sister when her father perishes in a mining accident. Set in the near future, most residents of Pan-Am are forced to subsist through utter capitulation to the Capitol's whims. The only ways out are to break the law and hunt outside the district (which carries a capital sentence), or prove victorious in the annual Hunger Games.<br /><br />Being forced to live off the land for years, pairing her natural talent for archery with Gale's instinct for setting snares, they eke out a comfortable, if arduous, existence in District 12. Until Katniss' sister Prim is chosen for the Hunger Games, despite only having one slip with her name in the Reaping. I expect this \\"coincidence\\" to play a prominent role in the following two books.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is fast-paced, with occasional flashbacks to Katniss' past, and how she seems to be the only lady in the family without a talent or desire for treating the sick and injured. Although she has her father's talent for calling out to the Mockingjays, she chooses not to do so, preferring the practical and more immediate fruits of hunting and gathering.<br /><br />The Games themselves are never dull (particularly because the Game Masters can't afford to rely on nature and the killer instincts of the contestants to whittle down the numbers). Any tribute who gets complacent or is lucky enough to enjoy a cushy half-day or two is immediately beset by traps, lack of resources, or anything else that could lie in store for them (including genetically engineered killing machines). They know their lives are not held in high esteem by the Capitol, and the only way to increase one's chances of survival is to appeal to one's sponsors, a task that becomes exponentially more difficult the longer the Games continue, and the more delirious the betting becomes.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is excellently written and paced, and while Katniss' introspective analyses of her personality, her emotions and her life can get tedious at times, it doesn't adversely affect the experience overall. It soon becomes apparent that while Katniss is unfamiliar and uneasy with the concepts of romance and love, she still has a firm grasp on her humanity. Love has been abandoned, alone in her soul, but it is far from dead. A sense of duty, obligation and debt has replaced it, and she hates being in anyone's debt (although she soon learns that this is sometimes unavoidable, and some debts can never be repaid, at least not in the conventional sense).

B00447L4KA|5.0|I love this movie. I've seen it a few times before purchasing it here through Amazon. I haven't seen it for a couple of years though on tv so I ordered it and watched it early that night. And may I say, Heth Ledger is definately a plus for this movie :). Lol. And I like Julia Stiles performance in this movie, her and Heth Ledger's. Its a classic that's worth being in your movie collection.
B003UXPUMW|5.0|Well, (((5+1)*2)*4)+4=52, not 40. But if the ninja witch says it's 40:1 I wouldn't quibble with her either. I kept waiting for Kahlan's dad to offer everyone some lardo, but the adaptation wasn't that literal. Great episode--definitely worth a watch.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|The Last Song...uhh...so many words for this movie. But I can put it into 3- I love it! Its not what you expect, its better. Way better. It had me all teary upped. Lol. My sister cried! Lol. Miley Cyrus did an amazing performance in this movie and had they of picked a different actress, this movie would of been all wrong. People give Miley Cyrus a lot of heat, but this movies proves herself. That she's a great actress and a great singer. Its a must for your dvd collection.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I basically purchased this CD for one song only.....and found the rest of the song list just as enjoyable.  Jason Mraz has such a unique voice, and is just a great talent in general.  You can't miss with this CD...but then again, it all depends on the listener and what you're looking for.  As for me...this CD was worth every nickel.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I really enjoyed the Percy Jackson series, and I think tha Rick Riordan is a gifted writer.  In starting this book, however, I thought that the author was trying to milk a good thing.  Wrong.  If anything, his writing has gotten better in the Heroes of Olympus series.  As a warning, I will say that one needs to read the Percy Jackson books FIRST to really understand and like these books as much as possible.  I think that the main characters are very well crafted, the \\"god\\" characters are a good contrast to their earler Greek presentations, and the stories are very interesting.  The book is FUN!  It is a great way to learn about mythology, it is an easy read, and it is hard to put down.  Enjoy!

B00141HPBQ|5.0|I had only read The Old Man and The Sea before this novel. This book just grabbed me and I had to read it until I finished it. The trademark Hemingway style of silence is present here. The landscape and environment are as much a part of the story as the characters. It took getting used to pages of describing the landscape so deeply, but once I went along for the ride I enjoyed the novel immensely. The plot seems conventional, that's fine for me.

B004EPZ0BG|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 1.5 out of 5<br /><br />Jamie is an executive recruiter who recruits Dylan, a young, up and coming art director for a small internet company in Los Angeles, to come to NYC and work for the much more high powered GQ Magazine. Before this happens, there's a prologue showing their back story: both are going through another unsuccessful relationship with a member of the opposite sex. When Jamie and Dylan meet each other for the first time, they're both jaded, as they've been burned one too many times, in their quest for 'true romance'.<br /><br />While getting to know each other, they watch a parody of a romcom (romantic comedy) on TV, both bemoaning the pitfalls of traditional courtships and wondering perhaps how they can circumvent all the complications associated with traditional romance. They forge an unlikely friendship where they can avoid any kind of commitment in the relationship and simply enjoy sex for its own sake. Hence, the 'benefits' is the satisfaction of having the sexual relationship without the commitment.<br /><br />Soon, the film's scenarists strategy of setting us up for an old fashioned morality tale, becomes clear. The 'friends with benefits' program--that is, sex without commitment, is only part and parcel of a larger overall problem with the personalities of our protagonists. Jamie and Dylan are unfortunately narcissistic, coarse and immature.<br /><br />The film's scenarists would like us to laugh at Jamie and Dylan, as they expose their foibles in the first thirty minutes or so. Jamie, the perennial go-getter, obnoxiously puts down Dylan, who extols the virtues of wide-open, west coast living as opposed to what he regards as the cramped living style of New Yorkers (the put-down becomes clear when Jamie sarcastically cracks, \\"What are you, a Gazelle?).<br /><br />If Jamie's coarseness is off-putting, it pales in comparison to Dylan's complete cluelessness. Dylan is so narcissistic that he simply can't understand why he's so wrong about Captain Sully. People rightly perceive that he's stubborn and ignorant when he claims 'planes fly themselves'. In reality, Captain Sully's plane was almost completely disabled due to the bird strike and could not possibly fly itself. So he's wrong on that count and 'tunes out' all those who are justifiably angry with him.<br /><br />Dylan's myopic 'Sully stance' is indicative of what's wrong with the first third of the film. By trying to 'humanize' the characters, exposing them as deeply flawed human beings, the film's scenarists have gone too far and made them out to be decidedly unlikeable. Somehow the Sully joke needed to be lighter and not cast Dylan in such a negative light. That way, we would care more about him at the end, when he finally does redeem himself. The same goes for Jamie whose constant use of expletives coupled with her overreaching competitiveness, also casts her in a negative light, during the expository sequences.<br /><br />The failed comedy of exposing the two 'losers' who adopt the self-defeating 'friends with benefits' program becomes a much more traditional romance in Act II and III, not unlike the 'film within a film' parody of the romcom the two lovers watch and disparage early on. It doesn't take long for Jamie to have true feelings for Dylan, after he invites her to California to meet his family and they have an intimate tryst. But Dylan remains locked in his fear of commitment and after Jamie overhears him putting her down while talking with his sister, the third act crisis is precipitated.<br /><br />It takes a little while longer before Dylan redeems himself by realizing how selfish he's been, but with the aid of two key allies, he finally sees the light. The allies who counsel Dylan are of course, Tommy, his gay co-worker, delightfully played by Woody Harrelson and Dylan's Alzheimer's afflicted father, Mr. Harper (solidly and convincingly played by Richard Jenkins).<br /><br />Couldn't you guess, but despite Mr. Harper's fluctuating memory loss, he manages to impart to his son, a tale of long lost love which turns out to be the big lesson here: don't let your best shot at love slip away.<br /><br />It's all very predictable and sentimental but Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis do seem to exude some chemistry, working together. I only wish their characters were a little less alienating and a little more gregarious in the first thirty to forty minutes.<br /><br />In the end, 'Benefits' can only live up to its billing for its romance and not its comedy. Simply put, there's nothing funny about obnoxious, clueless people. But once these protagonists are transformed, they do become a bit more likable. Still, is this rather predictable 'love-fest', a film you'll remember for a long time? I doubt it quite a bit.<br /><br />As an old fashioned morality tale, where a misguided couple realizes the error of their ways and finds 'true love' in the process, 'Benefits' fits in well with the pantheon of mediocre romcoms, populating our movie theaters today.ldn't you guess, but despite Mr. Harper's fluctuating memory loss, he manages to impart to his son, a tale of long lost love which turns out to be the big lesson here: don't let your best shot at love slip away.<br /><br />It's all very predictable and sentimental but Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis do seem to exude some chemistry, working together.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|As someone who very much enjoys Sci Fi, but who has been very disappointed about all the terrible movies in the genre that have come out  recently, I can honestly say that Prometheus was refreshing.  Unlike other, action orientated sci fi movies, Prometheus makes you think while never letting up on the amazing visuals.  All in all, the score, visuals, and interesting plot earned this movie a 5 in my opinion.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I just recently upgraded from the lite to full white noise app and would gladly pay double for the variety of sounds built in or downloadable.  Not only do I use the app at home, but as a 12th grade math teacher, I use it in my classroom.  The pleasant ambient noise helps keeps students focused and reduces the number of students who try to pull out headphones in class because they can't handle silence.  Thank you, ToMo.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|Words really cannot describe this wonderful film. Let me just say it's a great love story, with wonderful performances. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and it's got a cute dog too!
B0090EIILU|5.0|The Dictator gave me good laughs. Sacha Baron Cohen did a good job.<br /><br />So, the movie is not Borat quality (Borat involved real people and The Dictator involves actors) but it's still a good movie.<br /><br />If you are paying attention to the news, politics and are aware of some cultural misconceptions - you will understand where Sacha Baron Cohen went with the script.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Love this game! I play on PC, phone, and tablet. Transition animations very choppy on all my ICS devices. Still a great game, but seriously needs to be updated.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|If you're a musician and want to be inspired, then buy this disc. If you're a fan of Genesis buy this disc. If you are breathing and have a pulse, buy this disc. This is the best, most creative live concert film I've ever seen!! From the stage and set decoration to the sound to the songs and the interaction between the musicians, it's all fantastic!! Peter is great a helming the whole show and keeping it tight and mysterious at the same time!! Buy! Buy! Buy!!! You will not be dissapointed!!! Your Welcome.
B004UJST78|5.0|Absolutely in love. This is an incredible book, written by a scholar who only spoke various languages, but had profoundness in his analysis. A must read.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|The books, all three, were fantastic reads.  The only thing the movie and books have in common is the name.  Nothing else.  The movie is pure unadulterated crapola.  If I were able I would rate the movie a minus (-) ten (10) stars.  It is that bad, so bad that I was unable to finish watching it.  Don't waste your money on it, buy the books and read them instead.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|cant turn off the music no matter how many menus you go through which is frustrating because the help menu tells you there is one
B008MEM24S|5.0|My daughter loves this game!  Hours of fun for both of us.  Keep the &quot;Where's My&quot; games coming.  Thank you.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|I don't know why but the quality of this dvd set is terrible, its kinda hard to watch because it is so noticeable. Very dark, its not as crisp and clear, kinda blurry. I first thought the settings were messed up, played around with them and nothing, still bad picture, tried it on another tv and still have the same problems. I did not have this problem with the first season dvd set. This is a big disappointment.
B00756GKBA|2.0|I totally agree with the 1-star reviews. Been listening to Madonna from her 1st album. Was there for her \\"Like A Virgin\\" roll on the floor at the MTV awards. This album is just downright embarassing---the lyrics are cliched and amateurish! She resorts to her OLD bag of tricks---religious references, slutty language, and unimaginitive dance production, but most of these \\"songs\\" are soulless. And if she needs guest \\"stars\\" on her album, then it's proof that Madonna is no longer relevant! It really sounds like she phoned in this collection. ** Madonna: If you need some real songs, I have quite a few that you can record---I'll even help produce them! Give me a call!
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I saw this when it first came out and plan on buying it when it comes out on dvd.  Seems like most of these bad reviews are from people that don't like Kristin Stewart.  When someone you don't like is one of the main characters what are you doing watching the movie anyways??  It's common sense to avoid what you don't like.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|like the challenge of earning artifacts and points. runs smoothly. saves accurately.  have artifacts 2, also.  addictive.  like all 3 game sets.
1568363931|5.0|I got this book in today, very quick delivery! Ordered on the 28th of August and arrived on the 1st of September.<br /><br />I took a look through it and it includes not just a basic bento box recipe but many, many variations on every recipe, so you really get a lot more than what it seems when reading the description. It also includes different information on bento in general not just the food that goes in the box. There are handy timelines, bento box selection, japanese terminologies, and how-to's for making sauces and storing your food so it stays fresh until lunch.<br /><br />I am happy I bought this.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|I watched the Firefly series first, then Serenity, so that everything would be in order. The action is quite exciting and I felt very tense waiting to see how things would turn out in the end. Full of heart. Some sad bits, but very good film.
014004891X|5.0|This book should have been called \\"Of mice and men and crying your ass off!\\"  It's a touching story and a must read for everyone.
034580404X|1.0|I really tried to read this, having foolishly purchased the trilogy, but I couldn't. The \\"heroine' was so stupid! Who in the world is that dumb? LOL, She seemed to not know anything about anything, which is impossible for a supposedly intelligent woman of this day and age. I thought it was ridiculous for her to get entrapped into such a situation, unless she was mentally impaired. The book came across as very unbelievable, and i had no trouble putting it down after the first 20 chapters...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a truly heart touching story, very creative, and superbly written.  Makes you look at your pet in a new light.  Highly recommended.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|Don't expect fantasy.  Expect a political book in a medieval setting.  This book is lauded for it's ambiguous characters, however if you are ever surprised in this book by any character OTHER than Tyrion...<br /><br />If you like pages of descriptions of food, clothes, and weaponry with political backstabbing.  This is your book.
B008OOYALE|3.0|There are no goals for this game on the kindle. I'm level 12 and still no goals. I have the game for my itouch and it had goals right away. I think I may just delete it from my kindle because its too hard to get money and level up without goals. So unless it is fixed by my next level up I am going to delete it. It is pointless to play without the goals that's what makes the game more fun to play.
0765316994|3.0|I graduated from high school in 1966. So I was pretty young when the original Star Trek television series played out. Sometimes I feel I'm just as young and naïve now.<br /><br />This science fiction novel depended upon knowledge of the series, the fact that crewmembers unimportant to the continuing television saga got killed off in dramatic ways in the Enterprise's weekly exploitations. Scalzi plays on that \\"flaw\\" and builds his story from there.<br /><br />So the main dynamic is set in the future with a spaceship named Intrepid and its \\"secondary\\" characters. The main characters of the novel, those secondary characters, figure out that essentially the same dynamic is happening to them.<br /><br />Satire raises its head for savvy readers. Characterization is wanting. The dialogue seemed unnecessarily strained. The narrative focuses on the underlying mechanics and physicality of the scenario. The codas that follow the basic narrative play stronger, addressing such issues as life, choice, duty.
0425263908|5.0|In this time of 50 shades and all the rest people are looking for great emotional and erotic reads..this book delivers but is not fifty shades.  It is beautiful and written so well.  Bared to you will not dissapoint you.  It focuses on insides of individuals who may not seem like the underdog on the outside but is very much so on the inside.  The love scenes are Hot and will satisfy.  You need this book in your library and I am waiting for the next book in the series with held breath.
B00571F26Y|4.0|What most people don't realize is that humans were not meant to eat grains, corn, legumes, rice, potatoes and such. Those products were cultivated during times of famine, when there was not enough food to eat. We were meant to eat meat, poultry, pork, eggs, green leafy vegetables, and a few nuts and berries. And by meats, I'm talking wild animals that eat grass and forage for food,  not animals raised in big company facilties that are fed slop made up of grains and other dead animals.<br /><br /> Neanderthals and people who came before cultivation didnt die from the food they ate, they died of other causes. All the prescription medicine was and is developed due to the health problems directly related to the food we eat. Our culture has taught us that food is not only to be enjoyed ..holidays and gatherings but as a way to bring people together. Food's sole purpose should be to keep us alive and healthy.<br /><br />Not only are we feeding our livestock grains and such but we feed ourselves the same way so even when we want to eat REAL food it is difficult. We have to pay more money just to buy grass fed meats. What a sad and woeful world we live in where we no longer have the skills or desire to hunt and gather our food supply.<br /><br />Our world is all about money and things to behold rather than living healthy, strong and sharing with others. Materialistic beings who eat all the wrong foods and care more about clothes, cars and other things than we do about people.<br /><br />All the things wrong in this world are directly related to the food we eat. Most of our health problems, mental and physical are directly related to the food we eat. We see all these horrible things on the news that people are doing to each other but never stop and think that the foods people are eating are causing them to do the most vile things.<br /><br />Our bodies as well as our brains need proper nutrition to function properly. Not only are we eating grains and corn we eat processed non food items that destroy every fiber of our being, then we wonder, what is wrong with our world?<br /><br />I know people are going to read this post and say I'm off my rocker for saying all this but let me just ask this simple question. What does everyone believe is causing all the health problems, mental and physical, if it isn't the food we eat?<br /><br />Our government obviously doesn't care that big corporations are producing and selling food that isn't real by the truck loads and people are consuming it just as fast as they can make it. We are not just talking grains, legumes, rice and corn here people, we're talking, twinkies, candy bars, cheetos, and all kinds of non food items that do nothing to nourish or promote healthy bodies.<br /><br />I know what everyone is thinking. We have a choice, we eat what we choose to eat, nobody is forcing us to eat grains and junk food, but it's been engrained in us to eat this way over hundreds of years. It's not like people are walking around everyday thinking that what people are eating are causing mass health issues and crimes against each other. It's not like people watch the news and are thinking that guy that went crazy and shot up a bunch of people, has mental health issues because of the food he consumed. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't, don't think I'm saying that all health problems and all mental problems are directly related to the food we eat, or am I? It is a fair observation if you ask me, considering you are what you eat, I don't think I'd be that far off.<br /><br />Now ask yourself this,  what is wrong with our world?n food items that destroy every fiber of our being, then we wonder, what is wrong with our world?<br /><br />I know people are going to read this post and say I'm off my rocker for saying all this but let me just ask this simple question.

B007N8RULO|5.0|Great game I just cant put it down.  Very much a mind numbing time sink.  I have fun relaxing with this game.  It has something for all levels of ability. Highly recommend this game.
0205313426|5.0|\\"The Elements of Style\\" by Strunk and White is page for page the best book written on writing. If you follow the simple rules, your prose will be forceful, lucid, and understandable. I wish more academics read this book and put it into practice. Have you ever read the contorted, tortured prose in an academic English journal? Then, you know what I mean. Buy this book, read this book, memorize this book. Your writing will improve. Even if you never become a writer what you do write will be clear and concise. Remember one of Will Stunk's precepts: \\"Omit needless words.\\" The world will be a better place because of this.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I am a late comer to Lee Childs Reacher books so have read them in order in the last six months. Thinking back although I have read every book they have nearly all blended into one, and A Wanted Man unfortunately will mostly blend into the rest.<br /><br />The start was great, how to work out the  dynamic between three people who he finds himself sharing a car ride with through the night. Unfortunately it was down hill from there, if only a gentle downward slope.<br /><br />Still a good read though and I would recommend the series and the book but feel Reacher may be becoming a little tired.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a 14 on my 1 to 10 scale. Maybe if you play it you'll love it. Just like I do.
034580404X|4.0|Enjoyed the series but could have gotten the same story told in two books. Less descriptive info would have been fine with me.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I was surprised to see how much of the book made it into the movie.  Pretty much the entire book, from beginning to end was in there, with some changes made here and there.  But even with so much of the book in the movie, the movie's main problem was  Gary Ross' set up for it.  The movie's pacing was WAY to slow.  It should have picked up a lot of speed, but never does.  Another major problem that sort of ruined the movie was his direction for the action and the violence.  I know they wanted to keep this movie PG-13 and such, but the violence is one of the main themes and focuses of the book.  He turns to Blair-Witch Project shaky-cam effects when people run, fight, or get stabbed and the audience can't see what the hell's going on.  The camera is all over the place.  The violence is meant to heightned the storyline.  I know the action and the violence isn't everything but I thought that the director could have used a more effective way to show us.  Ross puts more attention on the forced romance between Katniss and Peeta more on the Games.  Instead, we have an uneven balance between the star-crossed lovers storyline and the action scenes.  I'm not one of those people who are obsessed with violence and need buckets of blood for every movie, but this movie out of all movies really needed it to showcase the theme of the novel more.  I'm glad he's not coming back for the sequel.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really super fun I enjoyed it a lot it was so entertaining I highly recommend it u will not be bored by this game
B007712XAU|5.0|I enjoyed watching seasons 1 and 2. I can't wait to see if there will be a season 3. I first saw this when I visited my daughter in Australia and was instantly hooked. The order came quickly and the products were in excellent condition - thank you.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|A great cast and superior acting. Like a mature spy movie out to be. Oldman shows his versatility. Firth's character/villain brings us the surprise. I watched it twice in the theaters and once on DVD rental. Digital copy wasn't available on iTunes(?). Thx amazon.
0062124293|3.0|I bought this after a certain website that rhymes with Schmezebel picked it up for their feminist book club.  \\"Belly laughs and crude humor?!  Sign me up.\\"<br /><br />Meh, no.  Moran tries too hard pretending to be a Very Intellectual Contemporary Feminist.  She gets points for trying, but her judgment of other women (and sometimes, ever so subtly) does more harm than good.  Whatever your opinions are on anything from \\"knickers\\" to adult establishments to adult movies to grooming, you better not be too fond of them, even if they are well-thought out and derived from years of actual experiences; Moran will, without even the grace of nuance or the support of logic, mount her soapbox and tell you what your opinion should be.  Concominantly, she will proclaim that feminism is about choice and freedom.  It's mind-boggling and ultimately detracts from any of the small chuckles to be found here.<br /><br />I am glad that another woman in the world has the moxie to navigate her life as a feminist.  But I found her one-size-fits-all opinions to be much more offensive than her vulgarity.<br /><br />And on the topic of vulgarity: it does not guarantee comedy!  Moreover, it gets to be tiresome when it is not funny.  I swear there are sections of this book that are just Moran's stream of consciousness, in writing.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I was enjoying this game, until it wouldn't allow the person I was playing with to guess before he drew for hid turn. When I watched &quot;him&quot; guessing my drawing, random letters were guessed until eventually the wrong word was chosen. So our score between us was reset. Fun game, but that's an annoying glitch.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wish more games were available - great app except for the ads every game... not bad for a free app
0525423656|2.0|I'm a big fan of dystopian novels and turned to some YA titles during the Hunger Games craze.  I really enjoyed Matched and made  sure to add the sequel to my \\"Wishlist\\" so I would not miss it's release.<br /><br />I made it about halfway through.  I can only think of only a few other books (Twilight being the most recent) I have not read all the way through, just on principle.  I did not much care about Cassie or Ky. It was page after page of pining after one another.  I didn't really care if they ever met up.  (Except I thought it might move the story along).  And then when they finally did meet up, it was more of the same.  NOW, they were pining because they were together and maybe couldn't always be together.  This book is all about a teenage romance, with all it's angst.<br /><br />I think my teenage niece would love this book.  That is the audience.  But if you are an adult looking for a good cross-over dystopian story, look elsewhere.
B001AFF25W|4.0|First I would like to apologize for any english mistake. This is not my native language.<br /><br />I really liked the book. To set a context: I'm a 20 year-old overachiever at the academic and work side. But I'm a procrastinator. I don't do things until the last minute and sometimes I even lose deadlines. I know I have more potential than what I'm bringing out to the world. And I felt more than ever the need to organize my time schedule, since I have very little time. So I picked up that book to read.<br /><br />I still haven't put everything into practice but I think it will be really helpful. Somethings are indeed already widely known. But at the preface, he says this is a compilation of all knowledge he has on the subject, that he's able to use.<br />This is very easy-read and most tips are really usable and practical.<br /><br />I'm giving four stars because:<br />A) I don't like the \\"fast-paced\\" life rythim he seems to want to live in. I think we need to be calm in order for it to work. I'd go with a more zen approach.<br /><br />B) I also don't agree with the fact that he says we have to eat low fat and low carbs and low protein. This isn't even consense between people that studies nutrition. His field isn't nutrition, and I think it is kind of irresponsible to tell people what to eat. I think telling us to eat healthy and exercise, or by other words, to take care of our health, would be enough.<br /><br />C) This is about me: I'm not a business woman. I'm not reading this book to be the best in my company. I'm not reading this book to impress my boss. I'm reading this book to acomplish my goals in life. And many of them don't include being THE BEST. I do think we should always try to improve but I disagree that we have to believe we'll be the best. As a person who suffer from perfectionism, I learned through life it isn't healthy.<br /><br />D) I don't like the affirmations he tell us to say, like \\"Go back to work! Go back to work!\\" or \\"You can do it! You can do it\\". It doesn't seem like a doable thing to me.<br /><br />Far from that, the book is really good and I really recommend the book to everyone!
B006JP11HQ|5.0|Milton Freeman and his wife were amazing people.  It's truely a shame that more people have not listened to them.  He and his wife were such deep thinkers, they turned what seemed to be simple matters into indepth studies.  I will reread their book.  I love my kindle and really enjoy the speed at which I may begin reading.  Thank you Amazon.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|Just a good entertainment.  Good pace.  Lots of laughs.  Some romantic elements so ladies will love it too.  Quite scary though, so keep little kids in their rooms...
0425263908|4.0|I ordered this book, Bared To You, after reading Shades series. Honestly, nothing compares to Shades, but I was into reading again and needed a fix. This book was good. I enjoyed it however, it was worded in some places exactly like Shades and made me think it was almost trying to be too close to Shades...I did however, finish it in a day or so and enjoyed it. Thanks
B005AKFXZW|3.0|The Night Circus is a book that had me thinking it was fairly good until I really thought about what I did and didn't like about it. I was initially impressed by the original theme and plot, and the writing is bordering on great but didn't quite get there for me. Morgenstern's descriptive language provides a rich atmosphere, but the rhythm overall is repetitive and, at times, monotonous.<br /><br />The editing lets the book down. I know a lack of punctuation can be trendy, or speed up the flow, but only when used effectively. Tim Winton is a skillful writer who knows when to leave out punctuation, but Erin Morgenstern's editor should be slapped with a wet fish. There were instances where sentences became unclear and I had to read them twice to make sure I understood exactly what they were saying--a comma can be a good thing. I also found a couple of run-on sentences, which a reader probably wouldn't notice, but as an editor, I couldn't help but see.<br /><br />The characters were likable and I could picture them clearly, however they lacked depth and I didn't love any of them. The love story between two of the characters had moments of intensity, but not enough for my liking (and I don't mean it should have been more raunchy). It seemed like the author was keeping them apart to build suspense and it worked as I was thinking, come on when will they get to see each other again, but when they did reunite it wasn't spectacular, it was just OK.<br /><br />I'm wondering if the focus on the circus took too much focus off the characters. The author has skillfully set the atmosphere and scene but it has come at a cost to character depth. Sometimes I wished she would just get on with telling the story, rather than describe every single tent in the damn circus. The circus stole some of the soul of the characters and none were as central to the story as it was, which I think is a mistake. To me, this book is a good example that characterization can be more important than plot and setting--give me lovable characters and I'd be happy to watch them lazing away on the beach, but give me boring ones and my heart won't race even if they're wrestling crocodiles.<br /><br />OK, I know it seems like I didn't like the book, but I liked it enough that I wanted to read the whole thing and I did enjoy parts of it, however it doesn't make my `want to re-read' list.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great  game. tons of options and or tweeks to make this a fun filled long lasting non boring challenging game.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is very fun. u can get high scores and improve them all the time. also you can unlock different backgrounds and swords! its a great game for all ages. in fact I know a 3 year old who loves this game too!! definitely a kid friendly game!!!!  by: Kylee
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I like everything about this clock except the digital time display doesn't show up correctly. The alarm still sounds at the correct time but the display is off not only in hours but minutes. I tried reinstalling it but this did not fix the problem.
B007JWKLMO|1.0|This is the worst documentary I have ever seen. The rerecording engineers completely screwed this one. The difference between the sound volume of the narration and the music is so great that you can't hear the narration, even if you try to change the volume between narration and music - the music cuts in and out of the narration so quickly and often that this documentary is worthless in terms of trying to learn anything about GH. Do engineers, directors and producers thinks it's nifty, hip, cute, etc. to blast your ears off during the music segments? I find it offensive and annoying.
B008BM9L72|2.0|I read all three Fifty Shades books!!! OMG a ten year old could have written better books.  I feel the author just copied story lines from Twilight and the Pretty Woman Movie.  It was also a modern day version of Pride and Predjudice!!!And these books have been in the best seller lists!!!!I would not recommend anyone to read them!!!Even the sex got boring after the first book!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This was a pretty good app.  Some of the games are a little challenging like where you have to uncross the yarn but it is pretty fun.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Lots of quality songs on this one!! Really great cd. There still going strong and with sign of slowing any time soon.
B0055S348W|4.0|Works as advertised for me. Doesn't support my Brother MFC-J430w wireless printer, but the generic driver will at least let me print documents and pdf files from it. Couldn't ask for a better printing app. -1 star because you support the MFC-J4xx series printers except mine :(
086571701X|5.0|I bought this for my husband... he loves it! Has started his plans to start our aquaponic garden!! He said this book gives him awesome instructions and is a great DIY book
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a very engaging puzzle game that really makes you think about the possibilities. Its also not possible to just try every possible way and get the solution. It has a massive amount of levels and they keep getting progressively harder. They also update it frequently and add more levels. I still have not been able to get to the last levels, as soon as I get close they update the game and add even more levels so I have the inclination to go back and do the easier levels first.

0307887448|1.0|So, having heard rave reviews of Ernest Cline's Ready Player One, I figured I'd give it a shot. I got the audiobook, narrated by Wil Wheaton, and inaugurated a recently-resurrected iPod with it. I figured I'd love this book. I grew up in the 80s - I'm a year younger than Wheaton and the Halliday character from the book (and four months older than Seth MacFarlane), so all those references should be right up my alley. Besides, I love cyberpunk. So - 80s themed cyberpunk? I should be loving this.<br /><br />But after four hours of the audiobook, I couldn't take it anymore. I know a lot of people love this book, but I didn't end up enjoying it one bit.<br /><br />The biggest flaw is that the 80s references aren't fun. They aren't interesting. They don't make any commentary or provide insight on the 80s. They're just sort of... there. This is the same problem I have with Family Guy and its endless 80s references. They don't actually amount to anything other than: \\"Hey everybody, remember the 80s? Yeah - they totally happened!\\" But it's even worse in RPO, because every reference is provided with an explanation. This misses the point of cultural references, which, in a way, are like jokes, in that if you have to explain them, the purpose of telling them has failed. Also, who are the explanations for, anyway? People who grew up in the 80s or are hip to 80s pop culture don't need them, and those who aren't are unlikely to be reading an 80s nostalgia piece in the first place.<br /><br />Also, Cline has no discriminating taste even in 80s culture. Thus, the references come across less as a bunch of hip references from someone who loves good pop culture than just a dump of a list of stuff that happened in the 80s. The disquisition on Family Ties is a good example. I watched that show with my dad back in the 80s, too, and I remember it well. It sucked then, it sucks now, and it will continue to suck in the 2040s. It was unfunny, maudlin dreck then, and now it doesn't even have any kitsch value. Every decade has stuff that's worth remembering and stuff that's worth forgetting in it. This book just seems to take everything equally, no matter where on that scale it lies. It comes off, as one reviewer on Amazon said, like reading a Wikipedia page on the 80s.<br /><br />And yeah, the exposition... the endless exposition. Even in the four hours I put into it before I gave up, there were things explained two or three times, in more detail than I really needed them to be. Especially since the premise is, really, not all that futuristic or original. Snow Crash covered much of the same territory twenty years ago, and MMOs have been around for more than a decade. Again, I don't really need them explained to me all that deeply, and taking the time to do so made the story sluggish.<br /><br />There's also a weird tone of arrogant mean-spiritedness to this book. It's a little hard to describe, but it reeks of that attitude you get at a comics shop if you say that you really don't know that much about Green Lantern or that Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was actually a pretty okay movie. The author's taking occasional breaks to beat you over the head with his sociopolitical views doesn't help, either. The whole \\"geekier than thou\\" thing just doesn't work for me. It definitely keeps the book from being as \\"fun\\" as a lot of people have claimed.<br /><br />And yeah, the writing is clunky and artless. It's of the \\"This happened, then that happened, then this happened, then that happened\\" style. The characters are flat and undistinctive, and have more than a whiff of Mary Sueism to some of them. The bad guys are generically bad, mostly because they - horror of horrors - want to run a business at a profit, which reeks of pure evil to those who have the internet generation's \\"everything ought to be free\\" sense of entitlement.<br /><br />And none of that would bother me if I didn't hear everywhere I turned about how this was the best book since A Tale of Two Citiesand the most clever thing to come along since Dorothy Parker retired. But I just don't get the raves for this book - it's a generic Snow Crash clone, except not half as good and peppered with joyless 80s name-dropping.<br /><br />Is it just me?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire and it works wonderfully! I love that it tells me how much battery life is left and how much is left to do certain tasks. This is helpful when you don't carry your charger all the time. Great app to add to the Fire!

0805095535|4.0|This is a memoir that is unlike any other that I have read. Paul Auster examines his life from a multitude of seemingly mundane angles. First he thinks about all of the ways that he has experienced his body, the joy he felt in using his body to play baseball as a child, the ways his body has compensated for his inability to express grief by shutting down and causing him to endure panic attacks when his mother dies.<br /><br />Auster then considers all of the addresses at which he has lived, and what the specific spaces have meant to him. My favorite was his description of a ramshackle farm house he purchased with his first wife in upstate New York that was previously owned by two ancient German sisters and still hosted their malevolent spirits.<br /><br />I think that this non-linear approach to auto-biography reveals more about the author than any other I have read because his categorical lists of remembrance are the ways, I think, that most of us think about our own memories. Therefore, Auster's writing seems more real and vibrant than if he had chosen to fashion his life into a traditional, linear format.<br /><br />I have read a couple of Auster's other books, but I don't think it is necessary to have any familiarity with him in order to enjoy this book. The interesting word pictures he makes and the unique point of view is enough to make this an interesting read even if Auster were a plumber instead of an award winning author.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|... on the tower defend formula.  Much more active than the usual top down &quot;hold the line&quot; style. Rather worth it.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, and though she has a long way to go, little miss Bella's acting was a step up. Other actors did a stellar job. A great dark fantasy addition to the genre of vampire/hunger games/avatar escapism movies we all enjoy so much.

0893860468|5.0|For 15 years I have followed teachings from the Theravada Buddhist tradition. Practice has deepened and blossomed with guidance from my local teachers, and from some of the great western teachers in this lineage. The Buddhist teachings are a raft that transport us to the other shore, but they are not the end into themselves. After years of learning the foundations of dharma, the destination is within view but rarely spoken about.<br /><br />\\"I Am That\\" recently came into my life. It now feels like Nisargadatta is with me on this path of discovery. Nisargadatta's words reveal the other shore. His answers show what it is to live a life undistorted by habitual mind states. When reading \\"I Am That,\\" I feel that I am touching true dharma and that the sacred that is me is awakening.

159448385X|5.0|The women in this book broke my heart and I wept many times while reading it.  The writer is so skillful, I believed the characters were real as I was reading.  Very thought provoking and enlightening on women's plight in Afghanistan over the last 50 years.  One of the best books I have read in a long time and am looking forward to reading The Kite Runner.
B003Y5H4SO|2.0|This is one of those films that could have been interesting with a bit more subtlety but instead falls flat on its face.<br /><br />It starts as a basic locked room mystery.  Five strangers are trapped in a stuck elevator and one by one they are killed off.<br /><br />But M Night Shyamalan gave it a supernatural twist which makes it hard to get into the mystery and then, even worse, gave away the twist in the TITLE!<br /><br />It could have been worse, it could have been called 'Elevator Murders: The Devil Did It'.  But not much worse.<br /><br />It would have made for a decent Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside episode but really the plot is not enough to fill a 2 hour movie.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was not at all what I would call erotic fiction.  This book was plain and simple, a love story that had an erotic undertone as part of the story.  I mean you could take the BDSM issue out of the story and it would not change the book at all.  So he ties her up once or twice, spanks her once or twice......not a big deal.  I have read a lot of erotic fiction and this was by far one of the worst once I have read.  I was really looking forward to reading the trilogy because of the excellent reviews, but I was very disappointed in the book and in the storyline.  I would not recommend this trilogy to anyone.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I presently use an Alfa AWUS036H with which I am extremely satisfied.  I thought I would try this Alfa AWUS036NHR for it's higher power and wireless N capabilities.  I am sorry to say, it is no where close to being as good as the Alfa AWUS036H.<br /><br />I receive my Wifi from an access point about 100 yards away, with a large metal building in between.  I have an outdoor directional antenna, the TP-Link NT TL-ANT2424B 2.4G 24dBi (Which is a fantastic directional wifi antenna).  I have low loss coax running into my house and have easy access to switch the adapters for testing.  I use Vistumbler to compare my signal strengths using the different adapters.  Here are the results:<br /><br />With my original Alfa AWUS036H, I have a signal of 64%.  Plenty of signal for a fast connection.  I removed it and switched to the Alfa AWUS036NHR.  The signal dropped to an unbelievable 6% to 7%!  A worthless connection as you can imagine.<br /><br />Just for the heck of it, I removed it and added, inline, a TP-Link TL-WN722N 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter that I had laying around.  The Vistumbler results from this adapter was a 34% signal, which I am using now to watch Netflix and write this review.<br /><br />In conclusion I would recommend purchasing the Alfa AWUS036H for your high power requirements.  If you do not require a high power wifi adapter that can reach a mile+, but will greatly outperform your built-in laptop wifi adapter, you can't go wrong with the TP-Link-TL-WN722N.<br /><br />Oh BTW, I have bought many items from this seller and highly recommend.
0312427999|5.0|I have yet to finish this book, but I'm through the first 5 chapters and can, so far, say it's a great book.  The book is well-researched and well-written, and for anyone looking to acquire a better understanding of the not so pretty side of Capitalism, I'd suggest you pick up this book.
B000059GEH|3.0|During 1953, Marilyn Monroe's star was rising, Betty Grable's popularity was waning, and 20th Century Fox was struggling financially due to TV competition. Fox came up with an idea to save ITS skin: they cast the new fame Monroe and the old fame Grable in a romantic comedy spectacular \\"How to Marry a Millionaire\\". To give the film an extra sparkle, Grable garners top billing, Monroe second, and other co-star Lauren Bacall receives thrid. Ironicaly, Bacall is truthfully playing the lead role. The movie recieves a three star from me because there isn't enough of Miss Monroe. I enjoy Miss Grable's performances (and others as well in other films), but I'm not to crazy about Bacall. Her husky, deep, and somewhat manish look about her makes her unattractive to me. Fox could've cast someone else in this movie with Monroe and Grable, like Lana Turner, Ava Gardner, Linda Darnell, or maybe even Susan Hayward. I guess if you like romantic comedies, this would be the one to see; however, don't go searching for much Monroe/Grable screen time.

0316067598|5.0|I grew up near Danny Dietz so when I heard about this book, I could not wait to read it! This book is so inspirational! I was completely captivated from cover to cover and could not put it down. The only thing anyone should be saying to these men is \\"thank you for your bravery and courage, to you, we are forever indebted\\".
0547569653|1.0|Bleah, boring. Perhaps my expectations were too high after having read \\"Born to Run,\\" which I found to be so engrossing and inspiring and I literally could not put down BTR. I was always keenly interested in Scott Jurek, but after reading this, all I can say is that he says over and over is \\"my recovery time got shorter and shorter,\\" and that's about all he says. Scattered stories everywhere that have no conclusion. Uninspiring, and the reader is left with no insight into what makes Scott run (at least not this dense reader).  I am interested in a few of his recipes. I had to push myself to finish and now don't even know why I bothered. Borrow from the library, for sure.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG...This is one of the best books that I have ever read.  It is definetely a must read.  I may actually read them again.  If you haven't read them then you are really missing out.

B005QUQP76|2.0|It's not a terrible mouse, but its defining feature (the aim button) is only suitable for huge hands, due largely to the fact that the body shape seems to be confused between palm-grip and claw-grip.

B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Great quality was what was advertised and the price was great and when I recieved this item so quickly and in perfect packaging, I was indeed pleased with my purchase. When I ordered this I was getting it for a Christmas gift and thought that it was a great price considering that the cheapest one's I had seen in stores were $39.99 per season so I ordered both the first and second season and couldn't be happier. Great quality and great packaging with my order coming in only 6 days after I had placed it. I will look for this seller again as we buy year round and are always looking for boxed sets of television shows at great prices. Very good product and service.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|First off, if you're buying this as a gift, be sure to pick up two AA batteries.<br /><br />The darts are soft, but firm enough to actually shoot.  When they hit you, they don't hurt.  You are shooting them very quickly out of a gun, so they can get lost under things like stove, couches, and beds. So plan on losing a good many darts.<br /><br />It comes with 24 darts in four cartridges.  I can hold up to 8 cartridges, so you can buy more and have longer between reloads.  But it still has enough to play with as-packaged.  You have to make sure you put the darts in in the right direction or they will get stuck in the barrel, but they're easy to get out if one does get stuck.  Cartridges only go in the right direction and the cartridges have a sticker on them clearly showing which direction to load the darts, but young children can still, in their excitement, put them in backwards.<br /><br />It would have been nice if it had come with some kind of target.  The inside of the box would have been the perfect place for a target as the cardboard packaging was rather big.  This was something that my son missed a great deal.<br /><br />Holding the gun:  It was comfortable for an adult to hold, as well as my kids.  Since it fires so many so quickly, you do have the ability to track the flow of darts and make adjustments quickly to hit your target.<br /><br />Final thought:  I wish it would have come with all 8 cartridges, not coming with four empty slots (which made my son feel like he didn't get a whole gun to play with).  An extra four cartridges cost at least 15 more dollars to have a full complement (bringing the total cost of the gun and 8 full cartridges to closer to 50 dollars).  Once you  add on 20-40 more dollars to replace \\"lost\\" darts, you've got a very expensive toy.

B00000DI2T|3.0|The problem with expressing an opinion on a complete set of Gustav's symphonies is that it is a task that requires months/years of close listening. I lived with this set for about 2 years, and simply did not like it. His original set with the NY Phil on Columbia (now Sony) is much, much better.<br />These recordings come late in his life, and his outlook seems to have changed significantly, but not for the better. His tempi are consistently slow, and seem to reflect a jaded, disillusioned outlook on life. Gone is the youthful, impressive, happy attitude, here replaced with a gloomy, grey, old fart vision.<br />On the positive side, it is always reassuring to have sure hand at the rudder guiding you through such treacherous waters. On the bad side, I do not appreciate being growled at and told to sit down and finish my cup of coffee.<br />I absolutely do not recommend this set. A more edifying set of performances worthy of your life force is easy to come by [[ASIN:B0000589BP Mahler: The Complete Symphonies ~ Bernstein]].
B007YNBOJM|5.0|I tried this at the Penny Arcade Expo today in Seattle, WA and they were quite fun. The demo lady was an expert at them. I was personally stuck in excited mode and couldn't get myself to calm down to try the other features of the ears, it takes practice. I have no idea how durable they are but they are quite fun and educational.
B000TDIDQG|5.0|The thing about Brand X, I mean besides it having caused me to take back all--well, most, anyway--of the nasty things I've said about Phil Collins over the years, is that their virtuosity as players is not just self-serving masturbation. These guys ARE virtuosos, but they use their skills to make really awesome music which serves the listener. I bought a few Brand X records (yes, records.... on vinyl), decades ago and the music is on my iPod today. If standing the test of time is one measure of good music, then this is good indeed.<br /><br />And, let's face it, for many like myself, this band turned the Phil Collins legacy from the lame, forgettable pop stuff he churned out like a placebo factory, to \\"Holy crap; this guy is a seriously talented player\\".<br /><br />\\"Unorthodox Behaviour\\" and \\"Morrocan Roll\\" are my favorites, though all of the Brand X releases are enjoyable.

I found it inspiring (you can do it attitude) and motivating, I wondered how many ideas do I have? The stories are ones that I can identify with and they got me thinking about what side projects I could start and how can I help others. In todays world it would be wise to have several streams of income, life comes at you too fast if you aren't prepared.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have to admit that I wasn't aware that this was a YA book. I also have to admit that this is the first time that I have reviewed anything before now. Haven't made these admissions, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book \\"cover to cover\\". The characters are so well developed that I felt I knew them. One might think that a book about terminally ill teenagers would be maudlin and overly sentimental. It is neither of these things. Absorbing and entertaining and thoroughly readable. Give it a shot.

B007KOYEOC|1.0|FRUSTRATION!!  I would review this ebook if I could read it!  I am sick of my kindle freezing up, especially when on holiday with pre-downloaded books.  It's happened too many times and I can't follow your instructions online to fix it.  Help!
030758836X|1.0|THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD READ IF NOT FOR THE F WORD.I DON'T HAVE THAT WORD IN MY VOCABALARY AND SEE NOTHING TO BE GAINED BY SAYING IT.I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT CONVERSATION AT HER HOUSE MUST SOUND LIKE.OK,I WILL ADMIT I AM AN OLD FOGEY,BUT I AM NOT FORCED TO READ HER BOOKS AND WILL NEVER BUY OR READ ANOTHER.JUST FOR THE RECORD I ONLY READ ABOUT 1/4 OF IT BUT KNEW THE BOOK NOR THE AUTHOR WAS SOMEONE I WOULD WANT TO ASSOCIATE WITH.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|Pearl Jam 20 DVD is is great documentary about Pearl Jam.  I found the history of Pearl Jams beginings interesting.  The video footage from 1991 was fun to see.  Seeing the band members talk about eachother and about the tragies they indured was inspiring.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves Rock n Roll.
B0086700CM|5.0|great time passer. good graphics. its free. doesn't get boring. well worth the space on my kindle fire. so y not get it.
0385528752|5.0|To start with, I really liked the 'rider-elephant-path' analogy that the authors have chosen to explain change. It made understanding the process of change a lot simpler.<br /><br />The book makes you think about human behavior itself and to some extent, answers why people are the way they are. It gave me some insight into how we can bridge the gap between rational/logical brain with the emotional (not so logical) will.<br /><br />I could also closely relate myself to some of the examples that are mentioned in the book - allowed me to appreciate the book even more.<br /><br />This book is for any one who works with humans. There are definitely scenarios where you'd want something different from the other person/people and the chapters of the book help you achieve the same.<br /><br />I would like to start by applying these concepts on myself first.<br /><br />\\"For individual's behavior to change, you've got to influence not only their environment, but their hearts and minds. The problem is that heart and minds often disagree.\\"
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book gets even better. This book made my husband an I very happy ;) one of the best books I have read. Had a little bit evrything omg its a must read and a must read again!
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|Flat characters and weak storyline.  Just watch a MUCH better film like Battle Royal and you'll see why Hunger Games hardly compares.<br /><br />I went to the theater to watch Hunger Games and walked out after seeing enough Rupaul dresswear and lame slow moving storyline.  A few minutes watching Battle Royal, and I am writing this bad review for Hunger Games.  I thought a post apocalyptic movie where people off each other was COMPLETELY unrealistic, not good art because it teaches NOTHING, and is crap random entertainment.  Like watching it is worse than watching reality tv garbage.  I was wrong, Battle Royal redeemed that survival genre and I also remembered reading things like \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" and \\"Running Man.\\"  They can be done though the CRAP movie Hunger Games almost single handedley destroyed my faith in survival movies<br /><br />Hunger Games = CRAP
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So sad when it was over!! I want more!!! Loved it omg I am addicted I reccomend the whole trilogy to every one. The goddess within you will come to life!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great fun the puzzles do get hrder and i love he combinationof good art, good music,  and a good puzzle.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it!! It had a little bit everything the ending is soo worth reading the whole book I was actually sad whem I finished it bit super excited for the second one. Its a must read and I would def read it again!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|hi ppl rlly cool game. I love it. go sanrio and hello kitty. play it ppl go sanrio play it play it now
030758836X|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. It was incredible. The characters are complex, the writing is smart, and the plot is endlessly engaging. I've read some reviews that state the second half of the book isn't as good as the first, and that the end is unsatisfying. I couldn't agree less with those assertions. Buy this!
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a very awesome game.I love the whay that you can chang the sord. I also like the whay there is all different fruits
0345803485|2.0|Based on the hype, I thought this book would be a lot better than it was. I'm normally a fan of popular fiction and series, but I just couldn't get into this. I found the characters one-dimensional and silly, and the writing was juvenile. In fact, Christian seems like a teenager's fantasy concoction. The sex scenes were pretty good, if unrealistic. But then again, the writer is going for fantasy, not reality, with those.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its their when u need it it even speaks to u<br />I love it becuz it helps me get through the day without worrying about my battery life
1849386684|5.0|Justin's book(s) are a great adjunct to his popular and excellent website. The book has a variety of songs all presented in a logical, friendly, fun way. i recommend this book.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is the best app for putting me to sleep that I've found. the music sounds are very calming. I love this app
030758836X|3.0|I thought pretty much the entire book was very good....kept me wondering, kept me turning pages, fast paced, etc. But after 415 pg. and reaching the end?  I was very disappointed!  I'm still not even quite sure what it was all about, except perhaps two damaged people.<br /><br />And not sure if anybody else picked up on this and I hate to be picky, but I'm a huge animal lover....Amy's cat is mentioned at the beginning, got out of the house, is sitting on the front step, cat has been declawed and is an inside cat...I have 3 of those. And then? Nothing! The cat was not mentioned again until maybe 200 pg. later, like an afterthought. The whole time, I wondered did the cat run away, if not who was feeding the cat as the house was a crime scene, etc. Probably picky, but I fail to see why said cat was even mentioned at all if the reader wasn't given the info.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this game. it's a good challenge and great way to kill time. but i think the games are just a little too hard. and the prices for the games i think are too high.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love this game! so addictive! ! I could spend hours on this game. creating. then recreating. my city!  it is like Sim city! I am absolutely a huge fan and would highly recommend. it to everyone! if you like building/ creating your own city or town you will love this. I have been playing it for a week and I have only positive things to say. I love it because it allows me to be creative.
1439127700|5.0|This book was purchased because of interviews of the writers on \\"Morning Joe.\\"  The subject seemed somewhat interesting.  However, the book gave more than hoped for.  It was a great book!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It didn't take long to read this one. A well-paced read that grabs your attention. Great character insights with twists that make you catch your breath. This should be on everyone's must read list.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I love this game its kinda  slow but not impossible to level up. Sure I have to wait a day to battle but its not that bad. Add me hamster3.
B008XFAT7S|4.0|Not a bad movie if you're looking for nonstop action/fighting. No brain movie though. Plot was quite shallow. Acting was decent. Would rather have watched it without the sub titles.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|I haven't watched any bonus features, so I'm just commenting on the movie itself: What a great adaptation of Edward Albee's play by the same name. It's one of my favorite books of all time. I'm not sure yet if this is one of my favorite movies of all time--I'll need to watch it again. But it's definitely in the running. And I still think it deserves four stars. My only tiny criticism would be the length--it seemed almost to drag along towards the end. However, it would've been hard to choose things to omit from such a great play. The acting is brilliant--even by the younger, less experienced pair of actors. And it helps to think that Burton and Taylor were once married in real life--adds to the believability of it all. Great movie. Very entertaining. A must see! (unless you're not a fan of dark comedy)
B00846REIS|3.0|A decent story, but not as well written as 50 Shades.  The ending was not just disappointing, but boring as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Although slow at times, this book has you waiting for the next plot to unfold. I would have finished the book in one day if I didn't have to actually go to work! It was a great book.
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|I purchased this book for my Kindle after reading a review of it on a website that had mentioned it in a top 10 fictional series list.  After scrutinizing the list, I decided that it sounded like something I would like, and I purchased this book to give it a try.  I had trouble getting a feel for the time and place of the story - the setting seemed to be futuristic, but it also seemed like a completely fictionalized world where there was no comparison to be made with the world I live in.  There simply wasn't enough description to know for sure.  There were no characters that I could identify with.  I also didn't understand the wars that were taking place, because (to me) there wasn't enough background about them.  I never had the opportunity to \\"sink my teeth\\" into the story.  It seemed to skip around a lot and, just when I was starting to get into one storyline, it skipped to another.  I was used to that, after coming off the Game of Thrones series, but with GoT, the transitions were smooth and natural.  After wrestling with it for about 6 weeks, I finally did something I NEVER do - I gave up on the book about halfway through.  Of course, I blame myself for not being able to follow it.  I wouldn't be surprised to find out that it's my own lack of understanding and shortcomings that keep me from being able to enjoy the book.  You should try it for yourself - perhaps you'll love it.  Thanks for listening.
B004V5A7K8|1.0|does not work on HTC evo 4g. would love to play it since I spent money for it. hope this gets fixed.
B009157BWU|5.0|what a delightful movie! more please!!!! amazing videography! i especially enjoyed the closing credits! make sure you watch it all to the end!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great place to find ideas and anything else to make life better.  Great place to be when you're on a diet, because I find myself on here for hours and that keeps me from snacking. Works great on my kindle fire.  Thanks
0393316041|2.0|Feynman was undeniably brilliant but he was also a bully and a supreme egotist.  He recounts story after story of how he humiliated people, usually with cruel \\"jokes.\\"  I did not find him appealing at all.
B000OVLIQU|4.0|Very interesting story about the recording industry in general and especially the Beatles' albums.  Sheds light on the personalities of the Fab Four.  The only thing I didn't like was the author occasionally indulged in some personal axe grinding about people he clashed with, like Phil Spector.  But at least he was honest about his feelings.  I recommend this book for anyone who grew up in the 1960s and wondered how albums were being produced.  And by the way, George Martin is the only person who contributed enough to be called a \\"fifth Beatle\\", and you only need to read this book to see that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I wasn't sure about pinterest at first, but after getting recently engaged I have found amazing wedding ideas. I love it.
B000QUCNOU|1.0|The disk didn't play I tried to fix but got nothing. I should probably send it back but it's only a few bucks so I won't bother.
B007DX39XW|5.0|Took a while to finish but it was worth it. My daughter loves it and has many Lego sets this big.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is the fastest, most complete free  application I know of for quickly determining the battery level of my Kindle Fire.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a great app. I play on my Kindle Fire. It works well and easy to play. I would recommend  it.
B004IK9SQ0|5.0|This is one of the greatest books I have read in a long time. It cuts right to the heart of things. You will realize everything you ever wanted to know spiritually. I have shared this with friends of mine and they agree. It's a book that once you start reading, you will not want to put down. I love it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so much fun and super addictive . I got it for my son and found myself playing it more than him
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|its really addicting. I recommend it. I was sad when they didn't have it on kindle fire but it finally came. I was so excited! buy this app!
B008XG1X18|4.0|love it, but wish I could pin stuff I find while browsing the web on my kindle. overall a great app tho!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this game! has updates every week with different stuff. entertaining whenever you play. and don't forget to add me: gehyun
B005XN0SGU|1.0|Buy ComiCat, it's leaner and meaner than this junk. Prefect Viewer is not. ComiCat is cheaper as well and has more features too.
B00913DPW2|5.0|This game was one of the best ones I've played. The graphics and the music are great. Once I started I found it hard to put down, though I did find it necessary to use a lot of hints. A big thumbs up to the game designers. Keep great games like this coming!!!!
0553293397|5.0|Isaac Asimov is my favorite author and that makes it difficult to say anything negative about his work... So I won't.<br /><br />This work takes you back in time so you can see the future, a future that is yet beyond tomorrow, in a different light than you can see it in today.<br /><br />A future visualized as having similar morals, social interaction and ideals based on and somewhat similar to those held by Americans of the past.<br /><br />A dark future, full of bright possibility.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I read a review of this book before I bought it which I found to be very true... You will either love this story or hate it!!! I LOVED IT!!!!<br />The book isn't just about sex... although that part of it didn't spoil it... the development of the relationship between Cristian and Ana captures you in a way that makes you want to buy all three of the books just to see what happens. It could also be a life lesson in that learning to communicate with your partner can improve the relationship beyond your imagining!<br />Thankyou to E.L. James for a wonderful and fascinating story, which I will enjoy reading again and again.
1609611543|5.0|This book has totally changed my husband's and my life. We no longer have cravings,and my husband's arthritis seems like a bad memory.<br /> In one month I lost 8 pounds and my husband 11! Can't wait to see my next results for my blood glucose levels. I reccomend this way of life to everyone. You will feel and look so much better.
0142402753|5.0|This is another fabulous book by the author of the Gruffalo and I think one of her best.  I think that it is book that can be enjoyed by children of various ages.  Perfect for a 4 year old.
0307592731|4.0|Excellent read. An outstanding description of a beautiful region of America and amazing courage af a women that learned the value of determination to find a new life.
0142405809|4.0|This is another brilliant book by the author of the Gruffalo.  Would recommend this book to others.  Great for children of Primary age.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am 72 years old, male, and I have to say that I have never read such words that struck a resonance, an emotional link, as this has. I wish I was an English teacher in High School because this would be required reading; I wish I was a \\"civics\\" teacher so that we could discuss the implication of the words. Collins has put on paper what many have already concluded. Bottom Line: This is not a \\"story\\"; it is the Final Judgement!
1606863622|5.0|LOVED this book and movie!  Absolutely incredible!  Couldn't put it down!  I love Nicholas Sparks and this is my favorite book of his!  Such an incredible love story!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Others have described the plot and cast very well, so I won't even go there.  All I want to add is that if you are a senior citizen who sometimes feels that \\"that's all there is,\\" GO SEE (or buy) THIS FILM!!!<br /><br />\\"It ain't over 'til it's over.\\"<br /><br />LATER, ADDITIONAL NOTE:  This is one of the VERY rare cases, in my experience, in which I found the movie to be a lot more entertaining and satisfying than the book.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Loved this movie. Great story line, excellent special effects and pretty decent acting. Beats the pants off Transformers 3. Made me want to join the Navy and hunt aliens!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|simple fun and inspiring lots of plans to choose from i absolutly love this app there is no better way to start the day
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Just making money out of sex.  Perhaps for the young twenties. I should have known better am a non fiction reader, was just following all the chit chat going on about it and became curious.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun and addicting so easy my four yr old could play it but so complex to hold my interest too. I reccomend it.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This was my 18 year old's favorite birthday gift this year! She carries it around to \\"sonic\\" things randomly - phones, radios, door locks, etc. Only had it less than one month, so not sure how durable it will be. Would be great if it was metal instead of plastic, but then the price would probably increase, too. Great fun for Doctor Who fans!
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved this series! Not being one involved in this type of activity I wasn't sure what I was getting into. I could not put these books down. The BEST love story I have read in a long time.  Very disappointed when I was finished with the books.
0345803485|4.0|A bit too slow getting started but erotic descriptions are good. Younger readers should enjoy it more than sexually experienced ones.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has truly written a masterpiece in this book. Poetic and witty, theres not a dull moment to be found. Bravo, John!
0802473156|5.0|This book helped my husband of 5 years and I reconnect as it seemed like we had kind of lost our way. Five years and 2 kids later we sort of lost ourselves and this book got us reconnected and back on track.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|I loved it...But then again I love all animated movies.  Adding to my collection for my grand children when they come to visit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm retired, and I do not need a scientific calculator or one with specified scientific or financial uses. I just need to balance my checkbook or check my grandson's homework. This calculator is great, all that I need. And, I really like that the buttons are so large!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I liked it becuase its fun and it lets you play with other people and you can tip them and all sorts of stuff and also I think you should get it!!!!!:)
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Was such easy reading.  Could not put it down.  Was sad when the journey was over.<br />It really does get the mind thinking to bring different ideas to your relationship.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book draws you in with its love, tragity, hope and of course its hummer. Although cancer is always present, Mr.Green has found a way to distract, educate and inspire me as a reader, teenager, and daughter of a cancer surviver. Thank you Mr.Green. p.s. sorry about the abominal spellin.... in my defense im severaly dislexic and there is no spell check...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm  actually crying as I write this. Our class Mrs. Houghton's class, just finished reading this. I understand August. This book taught me that appearance doesn't matter-your heart does.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moCXKBIO8BMFP5]]ok so i paired it with a bunch of remote control led candles hanging in lanterns from my patio ceiling like in the harry potter great hall, thats where i got the idea for useing the wand as a remote control. works great. very good, plus with 13 commands i can also control my stereo and other devices.
B00005N6RU|1.0|This disc wouldn't play in anything! we tried playing it in multiple devices such as dvd player blu ray ps3 xbox all said disc can not be read, very disappointed about this purchase.  As long as it took to get here and to not even work.
B008D19WBQ|4.0|Does the red box set of Friends on DVD have the extra footage in each/certain episodes everyone is talking about. Also what extra features on this blu ray set are actually different than that of the red box set on dvd. Thanks.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the Pinterest app for my Kindle Fire. I broke my arm so my laptop is too heavy and awkward to deal with. With my Kindle Fire I can still enjoy browsing Pinterest and pin all the great ideas I want to try when I can again. I love looking through all the great pins.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Not impressed, written through the eyes of a teenager starting out in life, with a lot to learn. I could not recommend it.
030758836X|3.0|I was totally into this book, like staying up late with my Kindle until I could barely keep my eyes open. Definite page turner. But the ending was so disappointing to me that I am sorry I read it and wouldn't recommend it. Totally un-satisfying. I read a lot of books, and I don't mind an ambiguous ending, but this did not work at all for me, there was no pay off.<br />Also if you have a thin skin for derogatory names toward women, I wouldn't even bother with this book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app everyday.  It keeps track of my battery &amp; lets me know if its healthy, too hot, etc. Pretty smooth app. I love it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Play this all the time, my now favorite on the go game. One finger is all you need to have the most fun of while out and about our even at home. Must try!
B007VUA7VO|2.0|Ever since I installed this app my battery life drains so fast. I'm uninstalling this app as soon as I post this review.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I absolultly love all the angry bird games. But I am mad because somehow my 3 year old bypassed the parental controls and bought this ap. Thank God it wasn't one of those expensive ones and it is one that he will play a lot. Angry Birds is a favorite with everyone in this house :).
B008YRVW0I|5.0|one of my favorite games!!! great graphics and fun &amp; easy to play. gain money fast to buy items for your tank. Very addictive! I don't want to put it down! I love that I can have it on my kindle fire.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|Couldn't wait for this music to arrive.  I am not disappointed.  The price is right and it has already given me hours of music listening pleasure.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey opened my eyes to a different type of sexuality that I have never even viewed before!  It's weird, but there are some out there who embrace it.  It's a tastefully written, humanly charged book,that I had a hard time putting down!  It is so erotic, and very spellbinding.  I couldn't wait to read the next in line!  Soon, I will reading the last one, and looking for more from this Great author!
034580404X|5.0|I had already read the books when I purchased this. They arrived brand new in their box still wrapped in plastic. Completely satisfied.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I love this workout and the music!  I have been using this workout for years since I had my last baby.  It helped me get back in shape after having the baby and it is the only workout I have found that I can actually \\"stand\\" the music.  Most other workout videos have the most annoying music.  The music on this video is great and keeps you motivated.  I also love that it is more of a low-impact \\"toning\\" workout as opposed to an aerobic workout.
B007X4ECLY|5.0|Lockout is a really cool action movie that everybody needs.  There's no hard plot to follow.  It's just a great action packed sci-fi movie that'll definitely pass the time.  Guy Pearce is a great walking one liner through the whole movie.  This movie is definitely worth your time and money if you're looking for a fun action movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it has all the info you need I reccomend it to everyone la la la la la la la la la la
B007JVJ3C4|4.0|Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a fun movie to watch and pass the time.  The first Ghost Rider is still better, but I'm not knocking this one like everybody else because it's still fun to watch.  The 3D version is pretty cool to see also.
B003Y5H542|5.0|this movie looks amazing and it has a lot of extras, the cover for the blue ray is great its raised image and what can i say if you liked this movie and are considering buying it i say buy it, its worth the money and its just amazing really.<br /><br />its a great movie for kids and adults all together funny, interesting characters also the extras are great, it shows the making of the movie and it shows how this movie is different and how it came to be the great movie that it is.<br /><br />(also i managed to get it for 12$ which dint last long but i managed to buy it fast enough before it went up in price :)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003Y5H542 Rango (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]
B005LAIH9K|5.0|American Reunion is definitely a good raunchy fun movie.  I definitely recommend this movie to anybody who's looking to pass the time or because you need something to make you laugh.  The people who give this movie 1 star and a bad review need to stop writing reviews and get a life and not take things so seriously.  These movies are made to make people laugh and have a good time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the Colest game I have ever seen no thing is beter than this game siriesly buy this super awesome and totaly cool
B0067R0APK|4.0|This is a very good weather app. I've bounced the predictions against other apps and the weather service. It agrees most of the time. It's being able to track oversea cities is a plus.
1476712042|5.0|The book was a twist and turn of love.  I thought the story was great and I loved it!!!  A must read.
0547564651|5.0|This is not just a book about changing public policy to give impoverished kids the best chance to succeed.  All parents can put the theories of enhancing success factors to work for their children by focusing on character traits such as conscientiousness, grit, delayed gratification, persistence etc.  These non-cognitive skills - and Mr. Tough characterizes them as skills because they are malleable and prone to influence through early intervention - are just as much predictors of success as cognitive skills.  The conventional view of pumping with and measuring child development on the basis cognitive skills, e.g. IQ is outdated.  How well your child can persist when faced with mundane and often unrewarding tasks is more important.  The ability to delay gratification is important, and in that regard, Mr. Tough cites a famous Marshmallow experiment conducted years ago, whereby kids who were able to hold off eating a marshmallow for the promise of eating two became more successful than the ones who forgo the reward.<br /><br />This very important and entertaining book is about solving the mystery of predicting \\"who succeeds and who fails\\", and there are strong indicators that conventional wisdom may not hold.  Mr. Tough draws on numerous unconventional U.S. educational programs such as KIPP focusing on non-cognitive skills of  children from high stress and adversity familial background, and what methods they have employed to close the gap with children from affluent background.  There are intriguing studies from diverse topics such as chess and nurturing lab rats to explore the neuroscientific and psychological basis of the arguments presented as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0345803485|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I mean...granted it was her first book, but everyone has their own desires.  This book series totally touches those bases.  I miss reading about Christian and Anna.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its nice to see someone left over from the early years of gamming is still around. I'm old school so 100 rupees and a 1up to the developers.

B0058VW36U|4.0|It was fun but eventually it became boring. other then that it was fun. It passes time. but like the title it was okay.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|dude if u first get it, 1 day or 2nd day u have it and it erased all my progress. I almost beat the game!!!
B002KKCVS2|4.0|We purchased these for my husband for a recent 2 week trip around Europe. The size was perfect. He wears a 9.5 in regular shoes. These were mainly what he wore for the whole trip.

I think this concert was 2 month before that Nevermind was realized I don't know but was close to that day so Nirvana were very well motivated. Dave a Krist were in good form. For all the Nirvana's fan I recomend this DVD.<br /><br />cheers from Lima - Perú

B000FC1MM8|5.0|I found the book to be interesting and exciting to read. Harry Bosch who is the main detective in the story is good at what he does and he loves his job. After I finished this book I started reading some more books by the same author Michael Connelly.

B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|Finally I'm able to write a positive review for an App of the Day. This game is fun, requires some puzzle solving skills and is actually rather clever in its own way. I have noticed one bug on the Nexus 7. When the application is in the background it doesn't sleep. This results in the music continually playing if you do not have the sound muted or have turned the audio off in game by tapping the radio at the welcome screen. I would prefer an in game method of terminating the game. For free, it's a great addition to your application library. With a couple of minor fixes, it might be worth a dollar.
B0079J28NC|5.0|I was never that big of a Beatles fan, chalk that up to timing and/or whatever, I appreciate their music and vast contributions to society........but that left me in the category of never having seen \\"Yellow Submarine\\" in my youth.  The review, however, of the DVD in the last issue of Film Comment made me take note and a chance on it.  Boy am I happy that I did, not only is it one of the most truly creative and inspiring animation films of all time but an absolutely terrific film to share with the family, in my case wife and five year old son.  Kids are already familiar with the submarine, blue meanies and oddly enough all of the beatles due to books that now circulate in pre-school, my son knew more going into it than I ever did!  And that's a real joy, we all watched the first time in awe and as of now, it's a DVD that has circulated on our screen multiple times without ever losing that magic.  The remastered release also comes with some nifty fan stuff in the DVD package, nothing that I'm apt to hold too sacred but great additions nevertheless.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|At first, this book sucked me in. Had a nice, solid start. As the story went on, and got less believable, I started losing interest. Still....a decent read.

B001TW69J4|5.0|This amazing album has been put into the \\"metal\\" category, but there are so many jazz/fusion influences heard here... mainly Allan Holdsworth and Al DiMeola... Pioneering dudes that most metal-heads never even heard of. And of course there's the obvious Rush influence and Robert Fripp's \\"Frippertronics\\" tape looping technique used decades before modern digital looping. As for the reviewer that described Rush as \\"prog metal\\", sorry bro but Rush was NEVER \\"metal\\". In the 70's we called groups like Rush, Yes and King Crimson \\"Progressive Rock\\". Silly kids. The \\"metal/shred\\" aspect of this album is only a part of it. I don't know how to categorize this record and that's what makes it so great ~
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Well, as others have said -- straight out of the Twilight Zone.  Crouch is a master at building a story and characters, adding totally unexpected twists and turns to create a story that you will be sorry has ended and won't forget in the foreseeable future!

B000Q7ZND6|5.0|I love this movie.  I can watch it over and over again.  Perhaps it's how cavalier Constantine is about eternal consequences.  It is certainly tongue in cheek.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|After playing to level 76 the game reset to the beginning. I lost every thing in it including the stuff I paid money for. This happened after the update. It was a pretty good game to that point.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|a great read to lose yourself in. Nice fantasy world with great story and character building. Disappointing ending to book 3.
0374275637|5.0|Great book from Dr. Daniel Kahneman. He is one of the pioneer in the field of behavioral economics. This book carries decades of his works and researches.<br /><br />It might be weird to say a scientific book inspirational, but contents of this book do make me ponder upon some of the actions and feelings that I've done. In some ways, it changes the way its readers look at lives.  The idea of System I and II helps us to make more appropriate decisions or at least understand why those actions were taken and perhaps prevention on making seriously wrong decisions.

B007SGM084|2.0|I have nothing against erotica as long as it is written well. I just felt that Ana's character was too predictable as was the first book and second book of the trilogy. To be fair, I did not read the third book as I was thoroughly bored with the first two. I had to keep reminding myself that these books were indeed, written by a woman. I felt that it was a woman's perspective written by a man. Too strange...

B0088X7YMS|3.0|I'm glad they made a animated adaption to the ST series. I was a huge fan of the first ST. This version contains all the elements that ST is known for; Guns, gore, and boobs. I was however disappointed by the sore acting and lack of depth in personalities. The characters feel bland and like a mediocre anime tried to fit the cliche' roles they were assigned. Sometimes the character personalities feel forced and unpractical like most animes. Speaking of animes my biggest caveat is the Japanese elements brought into this movie. Now I do enjoy watching anime (only some recently) but this movie is supposed to be a adaptation of a American movie so I wished they directed it in a style American audience can feel familiar with.
B000244FDW|3.0|Pride and Prejudice is a Jane Austen classic, and probably her most popular and most-loved work.  This film is a very nicely done version, but it is difficult to truly dissect and rate this particular version after seeing the Andrew Davies version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Colin Firth portrayed on-screen the quintessential Darcy that Jane Austen had in mind, in my opinion.  He managed to play a gentlemen of few words, with a stern countenance, who was drop-dead gorgeous and filthy rich.  His Darcy cannot be compared to any other, which makes it difficult to really enjoy any other film versions of Pride and Prejudice.<br />This version has merit, though, as the actors were well-cast,unknown to most of us,but played well their parts.  The scenery and screenplay were well-done, but the Davies version is still tops in my opinion.

1451648537|5.0|After suffering for a year with my first computer, a PC, I happily bought an i-Mac. I knew it would work out of the box. I pulled it out, plugged it in, and pushed the flushed button. Magic. I loved my i-Mac, and became a Mac and Steve Jobs fan. After reading this autobiography, it solidifies to me why the Mac products are superior in performance and experience for the user.<br /><br />I was up late evenings reading about the real-life drama of Steve Jobs and the Silicon Valley. It was hard to put this 571-page book down, but alas there was no way I could read in one sitting.<br />True, Steve Jobs was tough to work with, but he had vision and passion. Does that make his nasty behavior acceptable? No. Does that entitle him to park in handicap spots, before he himself had developed a handicap? No.  But, hey, who among us is perfect?<br /><br />Seriously, through the years and to this day, I occasionally will thank Steve Jobs for the Apple products I use. There's no other CEO on this planet that I stop to do that for. He was an amazing man, with an amazing story.<br /><br />Walter Isaacson, this was the first book I've read of his, and because I thoroughly enjoyed reading this autobiography, I plan on reading all of his other books.

B0000X61VE|5.0|This is an awesome video!  I have bought several and gone through them.  This is timeless, a classic. The look is cool, the music is fun, CIndy is beautiful, articulate and specific all the way through.  Even better is that if you use this 3 or more times a week you will see results of a better, leaner and stronger body. It works parts of the body we don't use and gets excellent  results. Since there are 2 separate work outs you won''t get bored. And a mini work out if you are rushed. Few work out videos offer this great quality and results! And even as Cindy approaches age 50 now...she looks amazing! So this works for her! I have hope ha ha ENJOY this! Not easy but worth it--work your way up to it! FUN TOO!!!
030758836X|2.0|I went in blind reading Gone Girl.  I had no idea what it was about but was sucked in by the buzz from friends, reading lists, etc.  For the first  third of the book, I had no idea where the plot was going.  Half way through, it suddenly go interesting, twisting in such a way that I didn't want to put the book down.  About 75% of the way into the book, I just wanted it to be over.  It kept getting more outrageous, ridiculous, and bizarre. Now that I am done reading, I still can't tell you anything about the characters or the relationships between the characters.  In the end, the plot wasn't that creative to begin with.  I have not read a novel by this author before but I can't figure out what it is that I just read. Was it a thriller? A feminist rant?  A precautionary tale on getting involved with sociopaths?  A love story?
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I loved being able to read the books I purchased using the Kindle app for my android phone. Being able to read on the go using this app was awesome.

B003XT60KO|5.0|This can be read in addition to Thomas Sowell's [[ASIN:0465003451 Applied Economics: Thinking Beyond Stage One]]. There is a lot of overlap, but this book differs in several ways.<br /><br />1. The chapters are very short and bite sized. Each section is about 10 pages and can be read just before going to bed/ over lunch/ during some 30 minute interval.<br /><br />2. The writing is mildly sarcastic and is a change in tone from Sowell's slow, reasoned writing style.<br /><br />What else?<br /><br />The author carefully circumscribes his topic, and he states several times (of some peripheral topic that \\"that need not concern us here.\\" The age of this book also tells us that a lot of economic misconceptions have been held for a LONG time. The book was written 50 years ago. Updated commentary was put in 30 years ago-- and yet the book reads like it was written yesterday. I don't think that one bit of relevance was lost over the last 50 years.<br /><br />Who is this book for?<br /><br />It can be for a friend of yours (that you want to keep as a friend and don't want to argue with) that is, um, not well informed about Economics-- but who does not want to go through all the gory details. It can be for a person who is reads Economics as a hobby (like the present writer) and wants to review/ keep fresh/ consolidate his readings over the years or have a good number of them in one single place.<br /><br />The book is just a couple of hundred pages, and I can't complain about the Kindle price, since the book version was about the same price ($12).<br /><br />Verdict: Worth the time, worth the money.
0307341550|5.0|Reason for Reading: I read Gone Girl earlier this month and thought it was just OK but I had read Dark Places years ago and loved it, so I wanted to read this, Flynn's first book, to see which opinion of her as a whole author I had of her.<br /><br />Sharp Objects presents a completely unique premise for a thriller that kept me on my toes and excited throughout the book.  From the first few pages I knew I was going to like the main character and she proved to be a multi-layered personality who did many unexpected things and yet remained true to her character.  The three main female characters were all highly intricate psychological studies of deeply affected personalities who the reader never knew whether they were truly good or bad.  While I won't say I was on the edge of my seat, as I had decided upon one of two possible solutions, I will say Flynn keeps you guessing until the very end.  And even when you think the whole case is solved, she pulls out one final twist to unnerve you and make sure you go to bed feeling slightly creepy about the whole thing.  I had a hard time deciding whether I liked this or Dark Places better since it has been some years since I read it, but I re-read my review and it brought the whole book back to me and this one wins out ever so slightly.  As a first book, this is extremely potent and Flynn has followed up well with two more.  Even though I thought Gone Girl was less than stellar, I still enjoyed it and will be looking forward to her next book.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I think I might be in the minority when I say I didn't love this book, but I didn't love this book. I despised the two main characters. I kept trying to find something about Nick and Amy to love, or even to like, or just something to tolerate. And I found NOTHING! Nothing about either character. The book would have gotten one star if not for the story. The story was interesting and the bit players were likable. Go was a twin sister who just wanted to believe in her brother but was caught up in the evidence. Boney was a good cop in a small town who also wanted to believe in Nick. Amy's parents were just plain weird. This book took me forever to read too. I just got bogged down in it. The story was interesting, but I just didn't really care how it ended since I didn't like the main characters.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Amazon isn't Rotten Tomatoes nor IMBD, so I'm not reviewing the movie, I'm reviewing the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />\\"This title will be released on October 11, 2012\\" - yet again, the industry is still failing to realize that people don't want to wait for the \\"treat\\" like rats in a maze - and then they wonder why so many commit the indecent crime of illegally downloading content?<br /><br />Prometheus is out of the theaters at this time, apparently. So why isn't the HD digital copy available? How is this mandatory waiting period a good business model, for anyone in their right mind?<br />To the old folks running the MPAA: wake up. Make this movie available for HD streaming rental/permanent download already, and you'll make money with downloads. No one cares that you still want to use physical copies. It's only your fault that you take time accepting new technologies. Physical discs are wasteful in this day and age. Make it available for purchase as an option for people who want to own the disc (me included).
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I remember my Calculus instructor years ago telling me I needed to see the greatest movie he'd ever seen--\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\".  I followed his advice and was suitably impressed.  Then came \\"Star Wars\\"--wow!  Critics have said there is nothing new in \\"John Carter\\" that they haven't seen before in these movies.  There's nothing new in any good story told since Socrates.  It's in the telling, not the plot.  This movie tells Edgar Rice Burrough's tale so very well with excellent acting, humor and believable aliens. If you've read the books and enjoyed them, you'll love this movie.  I wish Hollywood would go back to more classic SciFi.  Asimov, Heinlein, etc. done properly would be amazing!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very entertaining to say the least. The author was a little repetitive but I was still able to enjoy the story. I would definitely recommend this to others.

B0053VKP8S|3.0|Needed one of these to hook up my Sennheiser RS-120 wireless headphones to my Samsung LCD TV which doesn't have analog audio out (although the TV did have headphone out at the back but it was too cumbersome to plug in/out the headphone wire on every use)<br /><br />The DAC does work as advertised given the fact that my TV does have the option to set the audio out to PCM (even if the source is dolby).<br /><br />This DAC sounds quite different than my TV's built-in audio and has an impressive bass response and mid-tone clarity. As a matter of fact I was not aware that my headphones could reproduce good quality bass until I heard the sound via this DAC. I could also notice some finer details which I altogether missed earlier.<br /><br />On the down side, the only complain I have (and the reason I gave 3 stars to emphasize this point) is that it doesn't reproduce the high-frequency signals well. The treble response is quite poor and faint. I am wondering if anybody else faced the same problem. I tried changing the analog audio interconnect cable but it didn't give any better results and led me to conclude that the issue is with the DAC itself probably.<br /><br />Reliability - I can't give any verdict at the moment.<br /><br />Overall, this DAC allowed me to easily achieve the setup I wanted with my TV for interconnecting my wireless headphones and is serving the purpose well.

1423140591|5.0|Before reading the second book of the series, I had my doubts as to whether I would enjoy the book or not. However, now, after finishing the book, I realized my wavering feelings were completely unnecessary.<br /><br />This book, like all the others written by Rick Riordan, fully satisfied my appetite for literature.<br />-The narration, as always, makes me laugh out loud without realizing.<br />-The character depths (as in history, background, etc)drew me into the book.<br />-Percy's ear problem and sense of sarcasm never fails to make me smile.<br />-It is heartwarming for me to see the traces left behind from characters and adventures of previous books (aka the female Cyclops from Lost Hero...etc)<br />-As usual, this novel is fast paced and exciting, with a mix of love, humor, and unexpected situations.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this book is a must read!

B0041KKYEM|5.0|You will either love it or hate it!<br />This movie is very intense (to me). I didn't even realize I had been watching for more than one hour until it was done. There is no breather in the movie. Everything is closely tied together. The protagonist lives in a distorted world, where reality changes and black and white intertwine. I love the change of angle as it imitates the change of her mood. She is uncertain of herself. Her talent surfaces when the uninhibited side of her dominates. The distorted view of the world reminds me of schizophrenic patients. The struggle inside of her is dynamic. It changes rapidly as if she is a rapid cycler.<br />I know some of my friends will hate it. This is not an action movie nor a comedy. It is one of those philosophical movie.

B005OZDXR8|4.0|In a review of a set of recordings that include most of those anthologized in this &#34;Complete Sokolov&#34; set, one critic wrote that &#34;[Grigory Sokolov] has gained an almost mythical status amongst music-lovers and pianophiles throughout the world, and is now considered by many to be the world's greatest living pianist.&#34; (Musicweb) This is high praise indeed, however, based on the recordings assembled here, which date from 1982 to 1995 -- in other words, the most recent of which is already seventeen years old - there's not a hint of where the pianist is now, artistically speaking; nor, of course, would any amount of evidence suffice to pronounce him or anyone else the &#34;greatest living pianist.&#34; In any case, based on some snippets on youtube and other media I had high expectations for this ten-disc survey from the now 62 year-old Sokolov. At his best, in this wide-ranging assortment of recital out-takes, Sokolov shows himself to be a great technician without being a show-off, but also very musical and capable of sensitive, imaginative and insightful playing. At his worst, which isn't very often, the pianist indulges in grand gestures that fall flat and engages in excessive point-making.<br /><br />I started my survey, naturally enough, by listening to Bach (The Art of Fugue) and was disappointed to find it dry and monochromatic; and the absence of color and contrast results in a reading of near-formlessness. My reference point here is Vladimir Feltsman's recording which is a model of clarity and musicality.  Conversely, the second Partita, which closes the Bach program, is excellent. Sokolov brings digital precision to the score without overt pyrotechnical display, and combines this with genuine sensitivity. It's one of the finest things in this set.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the Diabelli Variations. Sokolov introduces moderately exaggerated accents into the first variation, which is tolerable enough; however, he turns the march-like theme of the second variation into pompous overstatement. Once (or if) you get past this bombastic opening, things settle down a bit and a number of the variations - particularly those that require fleet fingers - are vibrant and charismatic. Many others though are fiddled with and end up sounding affected. Inexplicably, this is romanticized playing of the sort that might be expected from someone who is completely unfamiliar with the modern approach to Beethoven. The op. 7 sonata fares better, with Sokolov turning in a competent, straight-forward performance. The op 101 sonata, however, begins with all kinds of hesitancies (which brings me to my chief complaint about Sokolov, which is that he is a pianist whose attempts to create the effect of depth, which are no doubt sincere, often end up sounding contrived). The March, which is taken quite literally, sounds like a series of pecked out notes with no sense of flow or continuity. The Adagio and Allegro are more natural sounding, but they don't erase the impressions made by the uneven opening movements.<br /><br />Sokolov shares Arrau`s grand vision of the Brahms op. 5 sonata - achingly Romantic with a capital &#34;R&#34; - and brings it off in a most impressive way. There's all the passion, poetry and drama that one could hope for  -- just a superb performance. Sokolov is also on firm ground with the two Schubert sonatas (D 894 and D 960), the later getting an especially fine reading.  Here Sokolov maintains the musical thread, singing out long thematic lines in the most natural way. With the exception of the slightly pedantic second movement, there's little interpretive interference of the sort that mars, for example, the Diabelli Variations.<br /><br />There can hardly be a pianist who hasn't been influenced to some degree by Vladimir Horowitz's Chopin. In the case of Sokolov's treatment of the B flat minor sonata, I would say the Horowitz influence was present, but clearly Sokolov has his own mind and what comes through isa sturdy, cohesive performance with just the right amount of muscle. The whole thing is very good, but the finale is truly exceptional.<br /><br />It's not often that a pianist tackles all of Chopin's op. 25 etudes in recital - a variable that adds to what is already an arduous undertaking. Sokolov is certainly up to the task in a traversal that combines technical brilliance with musicality; and, unlike Pollini's cold, steely etudes, there's plenty of warmth and humanity.  Nevertheless, Sokolov can tend to swing from one extreme to another. The tenth etude, for example, a masterpiece of drama and poetry in the right hands, starts out with great promise as Sokolov charges through the opening octaves. The long interlude, however, is taken too slowly, not so much that it drags, but nearly so. If only the pianist didn't feel so compelled to underline the contrasts in the music, which are already self-evident. While the results are the best when his hands are busy and he has no time to over-think - the &#34;Winter Wind&#34; etude is a perfect example of this; ditto the &#34;Ocean&#34; etude, which is fabulous - Sokolov's cycle is still an impressive achievement.<br /><br />The Chopin Preludes, on the other hand, are a mixed bag. The slower ones (for example (nos. 3, 4, 6, 13, 21 etc) are just too slow; and some of the others seem flat or one-dimensional. A few, though, are excellent: the 16th is a whirlwind, and Sokolov really digs into the 18th and 22nd preludes, revealing their underlying menace. Unfortunately, he can't seem to resist over-emphasizing the measure of quiet notes before delivering the three cannon shots that close the final prelude - another example of excessive point-making that diminishes what could have been an authoritative finish.<br /><br />The best things in this set are from the Russian composers. The Scriabin Third sonata is absolutely outstanding and so too is the Ninth, or &#34;Black Mass,&#34; which is among the finest I've heard, rivaling Horowitz's classic recordings. Both sonatas bristle with imagination and energy; clearly this is a composer Sokolov identifies with. The Prokofiev Eighth sonata is also superb. The pace is perfect (I always thought Richter was a little too fast, preferring Lazar Berman, whose recording is long overdue for reissue by DG), the percussive episodes are executed with just the right degree of aggressiveness, and the melodic sections sing beautifully. Unfortunately the pianist's humming - more like buzzing actually - is also audible throughout a good deal of the performance. All in all, a masterful reading despite the vocal accompaniment.<br /><br />The recorded sound is far from ideal, with the piano often sounding dry and airless with a fuzzy edge despite the variety of recording dates and venues. The recording levels are also very low practically across the board. The Brahms Ballades, for example, required the volume knob to be set to 75% of the maximum, but boosting the volume didn't compensate for the thin and distant sound. Furthermore, no attempt seems to have been made to adjust the levels from one track to the next as the source material changed. After the Ballades, the Brahms sonata, which was recorded at a more or less normal level, is launched like an artillery shot which sent me scrambling to adjust the volume knob yet again.<br /><br />For the record, this set incorporates all of the recordings found in [[ASIN:B0000CE7E6 Grigory Sokolov (Box Set)]] and [[ASIN:B000ALCFZ2 Grigory Sokolov: Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Brahms [Box Set]]] at a much lower price.a sturdy, cohesive performance with just the right amount of muscle. The whole thing is very good, but the finale is truly exceptional.<br /><br />It's not often that a pianist tackles all of Chopin's op. 25 etudes in recital - a variable that adds to what is already an arduous undertaking. Sokolov is certainly up to the task in a traversal that combines technical brilliance with musicality; and, unlike Pollini's cold, steely etudes, there's plenty of warmth and humanity.  Nevertheless, Sokolov can tend to swing from one extreme to another. The tenth etude, for example, a masterpiece of drama and poetry in the right hands, starts out with great promise as Sokolov charges through the opening octaves.

B008RTE09S|5.0|Yes, the movie is cheaply made and amateurish, but I really don't care, because spliced in between the poor \\"acting,\\" silly scenes, blurry photography etc is the pure magic of seeing the Beatles performing some of the greatest music ever written. When, the songs start, my heart still jumps, and I forget about the filler in between. In all fairness, this was an experiment for the Beatles; if the cinematic part of the experiment failed, what matters is that the music succeeded beyond all.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I've been waiting for this one.  So good!  I'm a big fan of the Alien saga, and I am very pleased with the way Prometheus turned out.  I've had friends of mine say that they were disappointed with the lack of fright that the Alien series gave us, and I agree that it wasn't scary.  But Ridley Scott took questions of evolution versus creation to a whole new level (at least on the big screen).  All-star cast, sweet action, and special effects that put the old Alien movies to shame.  Prometheus is not for everyone, but I can't wait to watch it few hundred more times.

B003ITZBVI|5.0|No Batman fan is complete without watching this movie.<br /><br />Seriously.  If you like Batman - even in the slightest - BUY THIS MOVIE!!<br /><br />This is one of the best movies I've ever seen...note I said \\"best movies\\" and not \\"best animated movie\\".  It's that good.  The emotional depth in the story-line is fantastic.  The plot makes sense and is gripping.  The Joker, as always, is fantastic.  Although Mark Hamill didn't voice him, the voice still fit the story...and was quite menacing, to be honest.  Also, Black Mask kicks butt in this movie.<br /><br />I'll rave on forever about how good this is, but in the end, get it.  Not only will it fill you in on the goings-ons of comics if your interested in getting into them, but it's an amazing movie in general.  Seriously, don't think about this one...buy it!<br /><br />As a side note, the Blu-ray quality was fantastic, and definitely worth the few extra bucks.  The extras were equally as fascinating and good.  It really delved into the history of the character of Jason Todd in the world of comic books.  It also explored (in depth) the \\"vote\\" that went out to the public that ultimately decided whether Robin should live or die.  Great choice of individuals for the extras interviews - and totally amazing extras, that really fill you in on the history of the Batman comics in the 80s.  Total awesomeness.

030758836X|5.0|Nick and Amy Dunne met in New York City, where they were both writers.  Amy was an only child.  Her parents were well-educated and had a happy marriage.  Amy needed to be Amazing Amy all the time.  She was a true New Yorker, who could cook French Cuisine, speak fluent Spanish, knit and run marathons.  She had a Master's in psychology.  She was very competitive and had a greedy curiosity.  Nick, on the other hand seemed to be more laid-back and liked a more quiet life.  He came out of a poor family and his father was abusive.  Nick worked hard for everything he had.  Although Nick and Amy were so different in their likes, they were in love and decided to marry.  When they both lost their jobs as writers, Nick came up with a plan.<br /><br />Nick told Amy he would like them to return to his hometown in Carthage, Missouri.  He borrowed money from Amy to buy a bar and it was named The Bar.  His partner was his twin sister Margo.  Amy was more or less left on her own with nothing much to do.  She had nothing in common with the people there, nor did she like the town.  To everyone on the outside, they were the perfect couple.  On the inside, the marriage was falling apart.<br /><br />On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick receives a call at work from his neighbour, Carl, telling him that the cat was let out and the door was open.  Amy loved her cat and would never let the cat out.  When Nick comes home, the house is in a shambles.  The coffee table was shattered, shards of glass were on the carpet and there was a pair of sharp scissors in view.  Amy is nowhere to be found.  There are signs that point to a struggle.  Amy had disappeared and probably been kidnapped. Nick calls his sister and the Police.  The Police arrive and they question Nick and then call in the detectives.  Amy's parents are called as well.  Nick is interrogated by the detectives and they are investigating more deeply now.  This was supposed to be the perfect marriage and Amy's parents, Nick's friends and neighbours sympathize with Nick.<br /><br />We only get to learn more about Amy through her diaries that she kept for seven years from their courtship and through their marriage.  We begin to find out that she wasn't very happy.  What could have happened to her?  Did Nick Kill her?  Was there a lover involved?  Her body has not been found.  Could she still be alive and held OR.......?<br /><br />As we read on, we learn from the diaries that there is much more to these two personalities than we know.  There are twists and turns, surprises and jaw-dropping scenes all along the way.  The writing is fast-paced and the characters believable.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has written one of the best novels I've read in 2012.  I highly recommend it.and neighbours sympathize with Nick.<br /><br />We only get to learn more about Amy through her diaries that she kept for seven years from their courtship and through their marriage.

If you are a Star Wars Fan,  go for it.  3 bonus discs are included. There are minor changes in the prequel which I will call as enhancement on his own movies by Lucas - I believe Lucas has done a technology upgrade ( like CGI was not when the movie was orignally released ). This is the best Star Wars collection ever released.

B005LAIHPY|3.0|Taylor Kitsch was in two huge tentpole movies this summer--John Carter and Battleship. For a number of reasons, John Carter did relatively poorly at the box-office in relation to its cost.  It was, however, a really enjoyable film.  Battleship kinda tanked at the box office also, and so I thought that maybe I'd give it a try also--perhaps two Taylor Kitsch starring blockbusters would be similarly fun.  Well, John Carter started with a killer source--a classic of sci-fi pulp by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Battleship started with a Hasbro game.  It is a fun game, mind you, but not much of a plot.  The movie makers completely embraced the concept of the game for this film--all the things that make Battleship a really fun game are here.  Two naval powers (one alien in this case) locked in a battle where neither can see the other and both need to bomb the heck out of the other.  That makes a great game, but kind of a thin plot as produced here.  The script tried to inject a little human drama in: the main character and his brother have a nice relationship, but it doesn't grow much.  Alexander Skaarsgard does a great job as the responsible older brother, but it would have been nice to see their relatinoship mature somewhat.  There is a very pleasant romance with an extremely beautiful woman who likes chicken burritos, a fact which fuels the best scene in the entire movie.  Sadly, that scene happens in the first 10 minutes.  Rihanna is another bright spot--true, she wasn't required to do much, but she had lots of screen time and she did a great job.  The special effects are, of course, excellent in quality.  Unfortunately, they are lacking in originality.  There is nothing wrong with the space ships--they look cool, but they look and behave like transformers.  The spinning ball saws are also very cool, but also look like transformers.  The aliens themselves are a little laughable, but get points for their creepy hands.  There are so many plot holes and contrivances that it getsa little wearisome in the middle, but in spite of it all, the movie comes to a satisfactory close as a popcorn movie should.  My pre-teen boys all thought it was great; I enjoyed it inspite of everything but will likely not need to see it again.  I probably should have waited for this to come out on HBO or something instead of buying the blu-ray, but i bet my kids will watch it enough to justify the purchase.  And if you haven't seen John Carter---give it a try.  It's much better popcorn fun.

I emailed them through the support link in the app just past midnight last night (Sat to Sun on a holiday weekend!) and they responded by the next morning, less than 7 hours later.<br /><br />very impressed.  bought from Amazon to support their ecosystem.<br /><br />only suggestion would be to keep the upgrade within the free app instead of being another separate app install.

I have this app saved to my favorites, which makes it more convenient to get to.  Also, it gives a more accurate idea of how much time is left for different programs, such as games, music, or other things.  This has become one of my most frequently used apps. It isn't something one couldn't do without, but it is definitely more convenient.

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I bought this ablbum the day it came out. It is one of the best albumns I've ever heard. Their lyrics are so heartfelt that you feel like the song could have been written about your own life. The music is well-written and powerful. I just love it and have recommended to everyone I know.
B008B3EQPI|5.0|Alright, I know people tend to throw around phrases like, \\"The greatest album ever made.\\"<br />And yes, that's going to by hyperbole no matter how much you mean it.<br /><br />When I say that Pandora's Pinata is the greatest album ever made, however, I mean it as much as humanly possible.<br /><br />This is the Diablo Swing Orchestra's third album. The first album was called The Butcher's Ballroom, and the second was Singalong Songs for the Damned and Delirious.<br /><br />If you have never heard the Diablo Swing Orchestra before, they are a swing-jazz/heavy metal band with opera vocals on most of their songs. They might, to a passive listener or someone otherwise not-paying-attention, come off as a gimmick band. You might listen to them and say, \\"Ho ho, that's cute.\\"<br />But further inspection reveals a tremendous amount of depth and thought that go into each song. The composition is flawless.<br /><br />Now, let's talk about how freaking BIG these songs are. Because they're big. Opera has always been a bombastic style of music, as has heavy metal. The Diablo Swing Orchestra combines them to flawless effect, creating tremendous crescendos. And with their classical and jazz composition, their songs tend to have a dynamic that really emphasizes those parts, by having quieter, mellower parts before them. Not in a formulaic way, mind you. Each song's dynamic is different. The quiet parts are also beautifully written.<br /><br />There's really nothing bad to say about this album. If you hate opera, then that's really the only reason you might not like this. And even then, several songs don't have opera vocals on them. Also, if you hate fun, I guess.<br /><br />Buy this album, and support this band!<br />They make some of the most well-composed, fun, unique music in the world, and they're only getting better.

006197806X|5.0|You know those books that make you want to cry, laugh insanely, hurl things at the wall and scream? This is one of those books. Just like the first one, Delirium. Oliver just has this way to make you truly experience a story and just dive in so deep that when you take a lungful of air you're sputtering and blubbering like an idiot with how freaking genius the story is! Oliver delivers and BOY does she deliver!<br />Okay, so I was excited to read this because I was dying to know if Alex was really alive. I was so torn and heartbroken when Lena kept running and Alex died. I was so frustrated and ag! It was awful. I cried like an idiot, just really like you wouldn't believe! So, this story was pretty action-packed and intense. Lena is supposed to keep an eye on Julian though she doesn't know why and when hell breaks loose in a conference they are in she sticks to the kid like glue and they both end up kidnapped. Lena tries to free them both, but things get complicated when Julian finds out that Lena is an Invalid...<br />The book goes back and forth between Now and Then, Lena when she first escaped and how she adapted to the Wilds and how she's coping and dealing with life nowadays. It was amazing and that ending was just so incredible and such a cliffhanger that I just am going insane! It left me my insides all twisted and OMG I cannot wait for Requiem!

B004Z4LZ7E|2.0|For a fan of the film, this book was certainly a great visual diary of the immense amount of creative design and visualization that was integrated throughout the film of Avatar. There's a page dedicated with sketches and models and sculpts of each of the recognizable characters, creatures, and components within the film.<br /><br />Personally, I was very disappointed. For a movie that so heavily touted the visuals as being the most prolific in film-history, this book just fails miserably at portraying it. Sure, there's sketches of every character and creature that was digitally created... but mostly the finished products. It doesn't show the development and earlier design evolution of characters/creatures. For me, I would imagine they didn't just get it right on the first try, and probably agonized and had alot of creative development with James Cameron's feedback/desires to produce a plethora of character drafts/sketches, but this just doesn't show it.<br /><br />I could compare this to the \\"Art of Star Wars\\" books that are phenomenal in breadth and variety, with how they include dozens of design sketches for characters that never even made it in the films. It was in a word, comprehensive. This \\"Art of Avatar\\" is almost like a kids book of the art, with very pixelated pages as well. They took screenshots from the movie and inserted them as full page bleed images in the book, but the pixelated quality defeated the point of viewing the images full-page. And for a film that claimed to have such high resolution and an incredible 120 (?) frames per second, the lack of carrying over that prestigious quality to this book is pathetic.<br /><br />All in all, disappointing.

With a mighty band backing him up,  this gifted and dynamic Italian vocalist grabs each note by the throat, throws it into your ears till your head is filled with his equally raw and smooth voice, and the sounds of virtuosity. I'm already starting a collection of his music.  Judging by the rising  prices, a lot of people are also catching up to him. Bravo Biondi!
B001MYIXAC|4.0|Forget about TWILIGHT, this is the vampire movie people should see. The snow-filled landscape is the most gorgeous this side of FARGO, and LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has a lot more than atmosphere going for it. In the end it's a coming of age story about twelve-year-olds, and one of the most interesting things to me is how Eli, the vampire \\"girl,\\" *is* a child, regardless of whether she's been around for decades or centuries (it's never made clear how long she's been a vampire). Eli is emotionally on Oskar's level, and at best, she has a little knowledge over Oskar, with insight to recognize that she kills out of necessity whereas Oskar's homicidal tendencies are rooted in being bullied and the desire for vengeance. The morality is even further complicated since Eli, who kills out of need, chooses innocent victims, as opposed to the bullies who are the focus of Oskar's homicidal fantasies (who are also, after all, just kids -- shitty kids, but kids). Oskar's ease of walking through doors, as he does repeatedly through the movie, is contrasted with Eli, who must be granted permission before she can do the same. This pays off when Oskar bullies Eli into entering without permission, and in this movie rules are there for a reason. (We also see Oskar, many times appearing almost ghostly, as a reflection in windows and mirrors; not so for Eli.) When Oskar sees the consequence of Eli's transgression, it doesn't matter that she's a vampire, he deeply cares for her, and she for him. The audience's bloodlust is paid off in a vicious and shocking way at the end (pay attention to the bully marching in place, as his legs continue to march as Eli drags him through the pool). Eli and Oskar's relationship is both touching, and in its implications for the future, frightening. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is, along with the American remake, LET ME IN, among the best horror movies of the last twenty years.

B000VS6QTK|4.0|I love watching the concert, lots of energy throughout, great songs, freakin AC/DC!  My only complaint is the sound mix.  I usually watch it with the 5.1 PCM version, and although it does sound good, the vocals are a little buried in the mix.  The guitarists sound like they are sitting right next to you because they are panned left and right in the surround channels, which is pretty awesome, I just wish the vocals were up a bit more.
B00887490Y|1.0|I do not normally leave reviews but I felt the need to warn people away from this movie because it is truly awful.  Jessica Biel must have owed someone associated with this movie a big favor.  I have no other explanation as to why she would have agreed to do this film.<br /><br />She spends most of her time simply staring, dazed, into the eyes of various people, saying nothing.  The viewer knows she is the only person who has any idea what's happening and the writer and director perform the most infuriating acrobatics to ensure she reveals nothing.<br /><br />You wait and wait... and wait for the reveal - and nothing ever happens.<br /><br />This is most assuredly not a horror movie and it's only a thriller if you're thrilled by 90 minutes of an exaggeratedly coy demeanor and excessively obtuse behavior.<br /><br />The manner in which this movie slowly culminates into some bizarre socio-political statement is akin to watching a very old man walk up a long flight of stairs, occasionally fishing in his pockets along the way and each time coming out with nothing.

B0058YPGSY|4.0|SOA is one of my favorite shows on TV right now. I ordered Season 4 to catch up and get ready for the Season 5 premiere coming up next week. I'm extremely disappointed because the BRAND NEW DVD set skips. A whole entire episode was skipped through. Needless to say, I'll be returning the DVD to Amazon and hopefully exchanging it for a non-skip DVD.

By the time you get done with the 2 book the author has you wanting to continue with the mystery continued on in book 3.

B001N1DPDE|3.0|I bought this knife as a sole survival knife for backpacking. I used it and then sold it. Here's what I liked and what I didn't:<br /><br />Good:<br />The blade thickness of .25\\" makes this knife an absolute beast. I'd love to see someone break one of these knives. It'd take some serious effort.  1095 cro-van steel is an excellent steel, especially for a knife of this size and at this price.  Speaking of price, this is the cheapest high quality heavy duty bushcraft knife on the market.  The 5.25\\" blade is a great length for any survival knife.  It's not so long that it becomes clumsy and gets in the way, but it's not so short that it can't split kindling.  I have never split wood with a knife easier than I did with the Bk2.<br /><br />Bad:<br />I think the single most frustrating thing about the Bk2 are the grivory handles.  They become extremely slippery with even slight moisture, including sweat.  So if you're chopping wood with this knife, and moving it quickly, the grivory can easily turn it into a missile if it's not secured to your wrist.  If you decide to get a Bk2, I would definitely recommend getting some micarta handles to replace them.  Weighing in at 1lb, this knife weighs as much as some hatchets.  Since I bought this for backpacking, weight becomes an issue.  Not an issue for every application though.  This is an excellent splitter and a decent chopper, but it is mediocre at everything else.  While the thickness of the blade makes it extremely tough, it also makes it much more difficult to do delicate tasks like food prep, sharpening tent stakes, or making feather sticks.  While it can eventually be done with the Bk2, there are many knives that can do these delicate tasks much better.  The grind angle of this blade is not 20 degrees.  I promise you if you try sharpen this knife at 20 degrees you will dull the blade.  It's closer to 23-25 degrees.  This is more like the blade of a hatchet and is great for heavy duty bushcraft but there is no way to getthis knife razor sharp without reprofiling the blade.<br /><br />I'll let you decide for yourself, but I decided to sell the Bk2 and instead purchased a Fiskars 8\\" hatchet and a Mora Bushcraft Force knife.  Both together cost less than the Bk2.  I can split and chop wood better and faster with the hatchet than I could the Bk2, and the Mora does delicate tasks 10x better than the Bk2.  Now I know what you're thinking: these two together weigh a little more than the Bk2.  True, but I'd rather have 2 tools that perform their separate functions very well than 1 tool that does some things very well and others just ok if they're going to weigh about the same. This knife is a great substitute for a hatchet, but I just found the blade to be a little too thick and the angle too wide to be a great knife.  If you're looking for a knife for heavy duty bushcraft tasks, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one.  If you're looking for an all around survival knife, I'd look elsewhere.

B004U52VPS|3.0|This is a great idea for a game (the whole concept, use of cards, building aspect, etc.) -- unfortunately, the construction of the block pieces makes it impossible to build the structures as pictured on each card.  I'm an engineer, and I couldn't build the structures as pictured ... my 6 year-old had no chance, so it led to frustration, and then we simply resorted to (as I assume most people do) building our own interpretation of each pictured structure.<br /><br />The problem is, the sides of the blocks (when picturing H x W x D of the blocks, this would be the \\"depth\\" side) are made so that it is not a flat surface; instead, there is simply a thin plastic border around the entire perimeter, with a hollow inside (think of a belt loop).  You are supposed to use these thin bordered \\"depth\\" sides as the stacking side, but they are way too thin to stack more than one or two bricks on, so the the entire structure inevitably falls down as you attempt to complete the structures as pictured.  You need to resort to using the flatter side.<br /><br />I still give the toy 3 stars, as my son likes playing it now that we've decided to loosen up the rules with regard to building structures exactly as pictured.

1402270275|5.0|Oh my I am sooooooo in love with this book.  An intriguing throw together of vampires and weres with blue bloods who haven't quite made it to the full change yet and a miss mash of the lower than low humans, some down on their luck and some just down right nasty.  Throw in people with some human parts, some mechanical parts and you are bound to gasp with surprise at the intensity of the lives they lead.<br /><br />The story is set in the nastiest part of London where anything and everything can and will happen.  Despair cuddles with fear but if you're lucky enough and find the right protector you just might be able to stave off some of that fear for a price.  But at what price would you be willing to pay?<br /><br />This is a hefty beefy story that has a lot of pre ground work introducing you to the how's and whys in order to give you the proper back story to bring you to the now and up and coming.  Action packed with love scenes that will rock your boat all in a bit of the tick tock Wizard of Oz style of Steam punk.  Oh what a ride this has been and I just can't wait to see what the next book will bring us.  I feel as though this is my dysfunctional family and it's killing me to hear from them again.
0062060562|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. It is not a typical thriller, although ultimately has to be fit into that genre. It is a book I found very hard to put down. Although by pages 15 and 22 a giveaway clue is given (twice) and one can guess the villain, the book hinges on the more subtle issue of personal identity: and not only the identity of the protagonist, a woman, who awakens every morning with no memory of the preceding 25 years. A person with no memory is at a huge disadvantage against a threatening adversary . I suppose everyone knows by now the author is male, but it would be hard to guess this from his excellent portrayal of the vulnerability, but also mental toughness, of the female protagonist. In fact at one point I thought the book was going to make an explicit connection to feminism. But no, the author made it a psychological thriller and it worked brilliantly.

B00003CXDV|5.0|There is more than one DVD issue of the 1999 &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;; this is a review of the 2000 DVD issue: [[ASIN:B00003CXDV Galaxy Quest]]. The Special Features aren't huge, but they are fun. And, besides, the star is this high-quality film itself. This isn't low-budget - this is the real thing. Great actors and great acting. Special effects by Oscar-winning Stan Winston as well as ILM (Industrial Light &amp; Magic).<br /><br />And a script to die for. There are so many good lines and good bits, and the take-offs on the original Star Trek are tone-perfect. I have so many favorite scenes, but every time I get the biggest kick out of the &quot;chompers&quot;. Gwen (Sigourney Weaver) and Jason (Tim Allen) have to shut down the ship's neutron reactor and are moving through the &quot;bowels of the ship&quot;. They're guided by Brandon, teenage mega-fan, with communicators. He tells them, &quot;Take a left and then straight on through the chompers.&quot;  CHOMPERS?! As Gwen squeals, &quot;What is this thing? There's no useful purpose for a lot of chompy things!&quot;, I am rollicking with laughter. No, there is no useful purpose, they are a writer's invention to add to the chase scene and tension. And as I'm hugely enjoying it, I cannot agree with Gwen when she hollers, &quot;Whoever wrote this episode should die!&quot;<br /><br />Totally excellent family entertainment.<br /><br />Special Features:<br /><br />1. &quot;On Location in Space&quot; This is an enjoyable &quot;making of&quot; short.

Certainly made it more real for the actors as well as the viewers.<br />I would love to have one of the Thermian octopus-like masks that were used for the Thermians!<br />Stan Winston's costume for lead bad buy, Sarris, is awesome, too.

B005FKGUTK|4.0|This book, given the era when written was a change in literature. It explores youth disenchantment and thier values in a world increasingly diffciult for them to come to terms with, related to such things as extremes of wealth and systems that do not treat all as equals.<br /><br />There is no question that the behaviours related to violence are unacceptable. However, Burgess is trying to suggest that without a changed world, these types of behaviours remain possible.<br /><br />The most important aspect of the book, however, relates to the \\"treatment' the main character receives that renders him unable to continue to commmit crimes. The thesis here is that we need to provide a world where people choose to behave appropriately rather than to remove peoples' right to make choices.<br /><br />A highly recoemmeneded text.

0143116177|3.0|Niall Ferguson's works about World War I and World War II were highly controversial when published and still are. All the more so is his book \\"Empire\\" concerning the British Empire, in which he argued that the benefits of Imperialism outweigh the drawbacks. You might not agree with Ferguson's arguments, but you can always count on him to put forward a thought-provoking premise.<br /><br />As well, Ferguson's understanding of financial history is widely acknowledged. Nevertheless, writing a financial history of the world is a not a triviality, especially when considering the shortness of the book.<br /><br />In \\"The Ascent of Money\\", Ferguson follows after the creation and evolution of the main financial institutions important to the development of Capitalism, and that helped to improve the quality of life of people over the centuries. Among other things, Ferguson reviews the development of the banking system, stock markets, bond markets, and insurance; he does a noteworthy job in explaining the importance and contributions of these institutions.<br /><br />Ferguson's main premise is that these institutions, which are highly criticized these days, are vital for the success of the capitalist system. Stock markets allow companies to raise money in order to expand their businesses and by that create jobs, or provide services in which the consumer is interested in. In the process, the quality of life of the people, who got hired or received better services, has improved. The banking system achieves a similar goal, but in a different manner. The banking system acts as the middleman, between the person who wants to lend money and the person who wants to borrow money. By doing so, it helps to better allocate capital into places where it is more needed.<br /><br />Ferguson's writing is very lucid and intriguing, and his arguments are compelling.  \\"The Ascent of Money\\" is more a short overview of the development and evolution of financial institutions and their importance tothe economy than a comprehensive account. In this narrow field Ferguson has written a worthwhile work, however, it is far from being a comprehensive financial history of the world as it claims to be.

The writing style might be great but this book was chapter after chapter of failure, disappointment, lack of communication, and non connected relationships.  There is no reason to read this book unless you are looking for an example of How Not To Live Your Life. The only relationship that brought this man any happiness was a love affair that he gave up when the University told him he would lose his job....so he stayed in the unhappy marriage in his unhappy life and died the same way.

1400069289|5.0|When I picked up this book, it was for a senior-level business management class. The book was introduced to me as a text on business and judging from its title and focus on organizational and corporate examples, it seemed like the most obvious thing in the world that this was a book primarily about business.<br /><br />I notice a lot of negative reviews mention that the book starts off \\"on topic\\" in the first section (which focuses primarily on behavioral science and neurology of habit) and then goes \\"off topic\\" for the rest of the book. I beg to differ with these reviews; I think many people thought this book to be a self-help book or a book on neurology. Make no mistake: This book is primarily about how the science of habit affects business and organizations.<br /><br />While it does hold plenty of advice for how to use this science in one's personal life, these are usually just meant as examples to familiarize the reader with the key concepts by applying it to uses that a private reader could relate to (making the unfamiliar seem familiar is, in fact, one of these techniques!).<br /><br />The science of this book is relatively basic. This is not a psychology textbook. This is not a neurology textbook. This book does a good job of making the basic concepts of psychological reward mechanisms accessible to readers before moving on to the real heart of the book, explaining how organizations use it. But what this book sets out to do, it does quite fluently. Most of the book uses anecdotes, varying from Target's customer identification policy, to a woman addicted to gambling, and more than a dozen more, to illustrate the impact of habit loops. This makes the book a lot \\"lighter\\" than, say, a psychology textbook, but it also makes the book approachable, easy to understand, and interesting.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you're looking for a self-help book, move along. If you're looking for a textbook on neurology, this one doesn't really have the focus you're looking for. But if you're interested in applying the science of habit patterns and behavioral science to organizational leadership or business, this book is absolutely a must-read.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is an either love it or either hate it book. I personally loved it for the characters of the book. Put aside the BDSM literature and concentrate with the characters of the book and their interaction. The way Christian evolves through knowing Anna and how she changes him is capturing. Better yet, is the way you unfold her own self-doubt and how Christian gives her confidence through his love for her. A love story that is very different than any other I have read or watched.<br /><br />I read the trilogy in less than 2 weeks, during a vacation where I had little time to read to start with, but I was so captured by the book, I couldn't let it down.<br /><br />You get to connect with the characters & I actually saw a resemblance with Anna's character that made me more connected to her.<br /><br />I do recommend reading it.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought this on sale (just under $25), in great part because of the price, but also because of the fantastic reviews. I was very impressed by the comfort of the headset, as well as the price. I'm very picky about sound, all my music is in lossless format because I can tell the difference between that and a regular MP3 files. Anyway, I'm very impressed with the sound quality, although I'm sure you could get better for a much higher price. I work long hours, and these are very comfortable on my head. They fit well around the ears without squeezing or squishing. The microphone also tucks away so that they can appear to be regular headphones (rather than a headset) if you don't need to talk when using them.<br /><br />As a side note, I didn't want to keep hauling them between home and work (I'm a grad student so I share an office), so I decided to buy another set. The price had jumped, and I was informed there was a newer version (Gamecom 380). That model was supposedly newer, sleeker looking, and just as good or better than this model. The headstrap is sleeker on the newer model, but the microphone sticks out like a sore thumb on the 380, which is very undesirable for my environment.<br /><br />The design of the 367 is also better in terms of comfort, at least for my head. As I noted, I love the fit of this model, but the 380 has smaller earphones. It squeezes my ears on both the top and bottom, and discomfort turns to pain if you're using these more than half an hour to an hour. Granted, not everyone has the same size head or ears as I do, but I'm pretty average in terms of size, so I imagine it may be problematic for others too.<br /><br />The 367 also has MUCH better sound quality than the 380. The 380 sounds tinny by comparison, and the sound is uneven (some ranges/types of sound come through much louder than others). I observed this in various types of music as well as SWTOR (SWTOR uses audio cues during boss fights, as well as regular combat, and it's much moredifficult to consistently hear and discern.<br /><br />Ultimately, If you're looking at both this model and the 380, get this model. I feel it's much higher quality than the 380.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The cost of this cover is pretty steep, but I got mine as a gift (thanks, Mom!). I resisted any type of eReader for a long time because of my love of reading in bed. I thought that I could never deal with an electronic device while shifting and settling in with a good book. This case truly sold me. I cannot stress enough how handy and perfect the little elastic strap is for reading in bed. You slide your hand through it, and the Fire is perfectly positioned for reading. It makes it possible to turn over and not have to grip the book in a way that you may accidentally turn the page. The stand works as advertised, but the strap is the crucial element for the 5 stars. One comment - the soft material on the flap picks up pet hair like nobody's business. I have to keep a lint roller for my Kindle for the mornings after a good reading session.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|This movie was BAD. I gave it a chance because of Guy Pearce. Don't make the same mistake! You will find yourself daydreaming of what you could have done with your time and money.
1416955070|4.0|To begin with, let me tell you, I'm only 18 years old, so this review is from a teenagers point of view. Also, I apologize for grammatical and spelling mistakes, I'm from Denmark and english is not my first-language.<br /><br />I don't think this book, or the rest of the series is for everyone. In my personal opinion it was amazing, but then again, I tend to get sucked into the typical teenage/fantasy book. I really enjoyed this book, the world it takes place in, which is our world and a little more. I've read all the books, that are published in The Mortal Instruments, and it's one on the first series, where I didn't feel like I could predict what would happen on the next page, though that might just be me. This is a typical teenage romance, but with some extra add-on's. There's family for once, which I felt like mattered a lot more, than in the average teen-fiction. Then there's the humor, I must admit I laughed out loud severel times at Simon's (The main-character's best friend) witty comments and jokes. I did feel like a Cassandra Clare made Jace (another main character)seem almost god-like, and too good-hearted. I liked the work in the series with angels, and how they're not the amazingly good creatures they're known for, and are highly dangerous, even to their own 'kids'.<br />This book gave me what I wanted; fantasy (I do love me some imagination), love, friendship, action, surprise, etc. But most importantly, it left me wanting more. It left me wanting to become a shadowhunter myself, it left me wishing that my mother had protected me as Clary, and that I would soon find out, that I too should spend my life, fighting, with runes burned into my skin, side by side with warlocks, vampires, werewolfs, at some point fairies, and of course my own kin, too keep the demons from taking over.<br /><br />As a fantasy loving teenager, I will recommend this series to anyone, who loves fantasy, romance, and action, but especially if you're still a teenager inside.<br /><br />With love to all my fellow readers,<br />Kat<br /><br />Ps. I mentioned vampires, don't worry, it's not the sickening 'Twilight'-kind, these ones burn in the sun.

B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Kept me guessing until the very end!!  I'm usually critical about mystery novels, but this one was a very rewarding reading experience.  Highly recommended!  The descriptions allowed me to totally assimilate myself into the storyline and I was THERE !!  Haven't been back to the park behind Notre Dame since the late 1960s yet she took me right back, easily and completely.  Thank you, Susan Kiernan-Lewis for introducing me to Maggie Newberry!  I am looking forward to other books in the series!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I am at a loss why this series is all the rage right now.  This thinly veiled primer into the abusive world of S&M is not only poorly written it slow and repetitive and just plain tiring.  I routinely skipped over yet another abusuve sex scene out of sheer boredom.  Not to mention I really couldnt stand watching someones spirit soul and dignity stripped away all in the name of so called love.<br /><br />This book is just titillatiom for teens and twenty year olds and misleads a young woman into the the frightening belief that &#34;If he feels this angry he must love me.&#34;<br /><br />Its disturbing abusive and two dimensional.  This kind of relationship doesnt have the Disney Princess ending
B005R6FZNO|5.0|This collection includes;<br /><br />Edward The Conqueror 9/10 (story about a re-incarnated maestro come back as a cat)<br />The Way Up To Heaven 10/10 (story about a woman who hates running late & how her husband makes matters worse)<br />William & Mary 10/10 (story about a man who's brain is removed & kept alive after he's died from pancreatic cancer)<br />Parson's Pleasure 10/10 (story about a greedy furniture antique collector)<br />Georgy Peorgy 8/10 (story about a priest with women issues)<br />Mrs Bixby & The Colonels Coat 9/10 (story about an adulturous scheming wife & her mink coat gift from the colonel)<br />Royal Jelly 10/10 (story about bees & the wonders of Royal Jelly)<br />The Champion Of The World 8/10 (story \\"poached\\" from \\"Danny, The Champion Of The World\\")<br />Genesis & Catastrophe 9/10 (a true story)<br />Pig 8/10 (story about the wonders of food)<br />The Landlady 8/10 (story about a landlady at a bed & breakfast who is very choosy about her customers)<br /><br />Some of these books appear in other collections, as is typical of Dahl's short stories they're all very readable. Aimed more at adults than kids although teens will still probably enjoy these.
0345803493|2.0|I feel the author has tried to 'push' in a story to a very repetitive format of erotic stories. The storyline is weak and alot of repetition is seen through out the plot. The main characters seem to have the intellect and resources but they are applied to only 'one' purpose.
0307742539|5.0|Of the 3 book of the series, I think this is the best one. Also the biggest in pages  once you get started to read it and get caught up with the action, you breeze through it really quick. In the end will get you. Just saying
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game for all ages! like that you are constantly building. good use of characters old and new. wish there were easier ways to earn acorns
B0002VFXFE|4.0|The item was as advertised, and arrived on time. The only thing is that this can be used for a one time only, as it is 3.5g (like half of a pencil).
B008XG1X18|3.0|ok I love the app and I'm stokedto have it on my kindle but half the time I open it and it says it isn't responding :((
B005LAIHGI|5.0|I absolutely recommend this movie to people from age 17+. Only if you've been following current events in the news will you understand some of the political references. This is a parody movie so as such is must be treated lightly, it is NOT intended to offend people but to simply make fun of racism, sexism, liberalism, ect. I don't expect everyone to understand the movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is very sarcastic, and rough cut and dried humor. Just another AMAZING movie by Sacha Baron Cohen! I'm so happy I rented this movie! Also being a female, you'd assume I'd find it offensive, but on the contrary I found it absolutely funny! But I do agree this is more of a guy movie. Sacha changed it up and used actual actors this time, and with a leading female actress like Anna Farris, HOW CAN YOU NOT WATCH!?
B008MEM24S|5.0|I started with &quot;Where's my water&quot; &amp; then when I did the preview of &quot;Where's my Perry&quot; I was in heaven again! My family &amp; I all enjoy putting our brains to the test trying to figure out the puzzles, its great fun &amp; for only 99&cent; you cant go wrong!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I read the whole series together and it was far too much. The novel is repetitive (count how many times she calls 'fifty' \\"mercurial\\", or describes her character as being \\"trussed up\\") and predictable.<br />The series is a tad overrated and, if you are widely read, just a little insulting and mildly condescending. One too many 'rich, troubled, handsome man' stories for me!<br />Having said that, if you are reading purely for the erotica (and are not particularly fussy) go for it.<br />Be warned: I didn't have high expectations going in and I was still pretty disappointed.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Who knew that 52 years ago when I first read \\"Flowers For Algernon\\" - written by Daniel Keyes, my English teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School, that I would be the co-author of 3 novels. Mr. Keyes was a wonderful teacher who encouraged me to write, but I never did until age 68.<br /><br />\\"Flowers For Algernon\\" is a classic tale of struggle, success, and tragic failure. The genre might be Science Fiction, but it is a story that surpasses genre and it lives forever. Cliff Robertson played Charlie in the movie adaptation \\"Charlie\\" and gave a magnificent potrayal of flawed genius.<br /><br />I have no special praise that has not been mentioned, other than the personal attachment I have to this book. If you are a parent, make sure your children read this book on their IPad, Kindle, or telephone. Of all the wonders predicted in 1959, who knew such things would come to pass?<br /><br />Neil L.

0345803485|2.0|I started this book three times because of the media hype. I find it shallow and poorly written. Not for me.
0307472841|2.0|Having only vaguely heard of Henning Mankell, other than in reference to his authorship of the famous Wallander detective series, and trusting good reviews of this book I bought it and read it. Without giving the plot away, I can say that it starts with a chilling crime in the icy north of Sweden, moves to 19th century America, and winds up in Africa before closing somewhat disappointingly in London. It's a good story, although rather too implausible at times, but then a good thriller should above all be a page-turner and this book undoubtedly is. On those merits alone I can recommend it to lovers of the genre. However, had I known in advance that the author is a diehard leftist, I would have refrained from reading this book. I dislike authors who insinuate their political views into the narrative of a novel, catching readers unaware of the fact they are buying a disguised political treatise. Mr. Mankell has every right to be an apologist for the mass murderer Mao (\\"no doubt, mistakes were made\\") or to whitewash Robert Mugabe's rape of Zimbabwe by admiring his anticolonialist zeal (who knew the British were still scheming to recolonize Africa?) but he might show more respect for his readers of detective thrillers by warning them that his work comes laced with a good dose of politics - honey to some, arsenic to others. His anti-Americanism, so salonfähig in Europe and apparently even more in Sweden, moreover is of the clichématic kind, when two of his characters, standing on a porch admiring the landscape, \\"returned indoors as soon as a group of American tourists arrived\\". Of such heady stuff is diehard leftism build these days. No more Maoism from Mr. Mankell for me, thank you. I gave the book away promptly.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love it its so cool and i love how it reads it to you and everything. its great to read to your kids or anyone for that matter

B007SGM084|1.0|At best the flimsy plotline that connects the dots through somewhat interesting sex scenes is compelling. Fifty Shades of Grey itself was quite interesting. However, this trilogy glamorizes and then subtly demonizes a sexual lifestyle that doesn't deserve such treatment. The third installment, on top of being composed horribly and ending in such a way that it makes \\"Cinderella\\" seem to end fresh, (They got married and had 2 kids, snapshot of the first delivery and the second is on the way! We fixed his issues, but he still has some hard limits, I accept that). WHAT BULLCRAP.<br /><br />If you love someone you don't expect to change their sexual interests in such a way that you completely diminish them.<br /><br />Are you looking for better characters, better dialogue, and steamier sex? Try the Black Dagger Brotherhood by JR Ward. If you really like the S&M you may be tempted to skip forward to \\"Lover Unbound.\\" The world building alone is phenomenal, but in addition to that, this book actually develops the idea of a sexually traumatized man who has a taste for being the top, with a woman who can't completely go there, but they find a way to meet in the middle. And the woman is smart, capable, and not a stupid, incompetent, infantile barely legal moron.<br /><br />Did I just say that? My bad.<br /><br />I am sure people \\"in the scene\\" have read this trilogy and found themselves nodding from time to time and thinking, \\"this is why I don't assume anything\\" and \\"this is why I don't play without a contract.\\" All I can say is, Ana's lucky she didn't get killed-- by Christian. Never, never piss off your dominant. Oh, and I can see how she'd let him use a strap on her, but orgasm denial is reason to use a safeword? PLEASE.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|few of my friends said the games awesome and so cool then I went to the appstore it's only a dollar so I bought it. I wonder how the game is!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Let me just say this, I am as dumbfounded as everyone else who read this trilogy and thought \\"what the hell?\\" In my opinion, this book was the worst of the trilogy, and it felt like the author decided, \\"Ok, well everyone likes the other 2 so much and the want more so why bother trying so hard?!\\" I mean, quoting Shakespeare from project Guttenberg, really?? Just the play and the character's name will suffice. If you're going to stick to a literary theme, stick with it. Don't jump everywhere.<br /><br />This girl was too stupid to live. The only real characters I saw emerging were side characters, and almost all of these people were destroyed in this last portion.<br /><br />Also, I hate the chronology of this portion. They're on the honeymoon, they're home, they're on the honeymoon. Flashbacks are for hacks. It's a good pnuemonic device for a reason.<br /><br />Also, while the evil hag deserves punishment for her crimes, why does Christian? The whole story just fell apart here.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is awesome, I could not put  it down once I started reading it. I was so sad to be done reading, it left me wanting the story line to continue. Hopefully there will be a book four, even five.[[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app. Pinerest on my Kindle Fire was so...... difficult to pin.The app. makes it easy as pie!!!!!! I will now really spend too much time on it.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|nice and easy. a game I can pick up and play a few minutes here and there all day. I would recommend this game to all ages
B002GJT4XM|5.0|I think it was one of the very best series of movies any one has ever made because as many times I've seen the movies of the series,I still get excited because I see things I didn't see before and I love it and well always think it is the best series of movies ever made today.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Upon my 1st listen - I knew instantly this was going to make my all time favorites list.  There is no mistaking it's brilliance and originality. The style is simple but still lushly fills my sonic appetite with everything I need.  Like having a delicious meal that makes you salivate not for it's complexity, but for it's carefully chosen parts.  A dish that makes you realize that when you're cooking with great and fresh ingredients - you can taste and appreciate every savory component for what what it is in itself, and how it plays with the other ingredients to form something wonderful.  I love this album because it's a masterfully executed recipe of lyric, melody and production.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is a pretty good game. even for adults. quick short levels that require brains as well as skill. I like it alot.
B007KL8Z40|5.0|A dark but very beautiful album.  Sometimes haunting, sometimes grand.  Pristine sounding production.  Stylistically very unique and timeless.  Definitely appealing to a very musical music listener (but not in a complex progressive way).  I don't give 5 star reviews lightly.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is awesome.I think that this app is great for people who do not like spending a lot on apps.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this book is amazing except sad at end best book ever known you guys gotta read it.i cant wait till next year house of hades
B006RUJST6|3.0|This was truly a solid debut book. I downloaded the sequel instantly after finishing this book in under a day.<br /><br />The experiences of this young couple set a solid foundation for not only the plot of this book but the series. A constant struggle to do the right thing for their families as would adults while struggling daily to fight off the reasonable desire to live and enjoy a \\"normal\\" teenage life. There is a very natural progression in the sequence of events. The events that take place aren't breathtaking, spectacular, but very realistic and one can see themselves in very similar scenarios.<br /><br />Because of this, many find the book slow at times but I loved it.<br /><br />The narrator is very witty and amusing, yet always seems to give into to her emotions despite her every effort to do so. She doesn't pretend to be tough which is admirable. She has a very honest view of things which one can appreciate.<br /><br />Don't let my 3star rating deter you...I've read some very amazing titles, and this is btw of NYT best seller far more worthy than the Shades of Grey series (in the honest opinion of many).
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very addictive and fun.  I highly recommend these games.  I love them.  Great games for the brain.  Do yourself a cavorted and download and enjoy.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|I liked this movie in the theatre and i like this movie on Blue Ray. Try and put the Blue Ray in a home theater of any type<br />to feel the effects it was designed to give.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really loved this book. The way the author twisted how the story is written was great. Clearly stepping out of the box of what we read today. I have recommended this book to several people I know. They have also loved it. This one is a keeper for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app,  and so many available versions so you can find what works best for you. Many grateful functions and plans,  bookmarking and a spot for notes. Only complaint is that I don't take advantage of it enough.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|This is a fantastic movie! This makes me proud to be an American. It also is a great reminder of all the sacrifice made everyday by every soldier and his/ her family to protect and to serve.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the numbers are beyond easy to see. good for me... I love it.  does just what I want<br />so I am very happy with it and it is free!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing. You need to get this game. If you don't like this there is something wrong with you. The only problem with it is on the kindle fire it is hard to control it.
B00843TZJM|3.0|It's been a few years since I've seen CSN live. They've always been a fantastic act. They still do most of the songs I'd like to hear, but this is the first time I've had to admit that they are getting older. The harmonies are'nt as sharp as they used to be. Missed Mike Finnegan on keyboards. He's great.  I'd still pay to go see them.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|loved the game but it just got boring after a while. love the simplicity of it. great down time fun.
B000N2HCM4|3.0|I was under the impression this was an uplifting story. Instead it is a book written by a humorless, bitter, rather racist man.  I don't think I've ever read a book where the author was so obsessed by race, he sees every slight as being racially motivated.<br />I'm really glad I didn't listen to this on audio, because I really don't want to hear the President of the United States in his own voice insinuate his grandmother was a racist or discuss how he smiled at white people to reassure them or how it is self hatred that makes a black woman want to wear blue contact lenses.  It offended me how he tries to glom on to \\"our people\\" when he is not descended from Africans brought here against their will to be slaves and never had to deal with Jim Crow segregation.  This is a middle class guy who went to PRIVATE PREP SCHOOL and apparently was given a good enough allowance to buy good weed.  It just smacks of someone who grew up in the suburbs and has romantic dreams of being from the `hood.<br />Some of the stories seem rather contrived, like Tut being so scared by the black man at the bus stop that Gramps had to drive her to work or the tearful breakdown at the gravesite of Barack Sr.  I didn't understand the whole \\"there was no shame in your confusion\\" thing.  Barack Sr. had a wonderful opportunity and threw it away because he was a drunk and a womanizer.<br />There were several times I almost stopped reading.  My opinion, this is a book written by a spoiled upper middle class guy with way too much time to feel sorry for himself
B008VBYN80|5.0|Good game, expands the genre with battle and troop upgrades. Not willing to buy the gems, or diamonds or whatever, but it is fun, and well worth the play.
0545123275|4.0|Very enjoyable read! A young girl is snatched off a swing and molested. Not by a man, but by a pack of wolves. Soon, we see that the story is being told alternating between the girl (years later) and the wolf that saved her. A story, ultimately, about love, but also showcasing how teens these days are not in the same universe as their parents. Friends share a lot, but not everything. And: you love who you love.
B001NBEWN6|3.0|Interesting story line but a little aimless and meandering at times. Great character development with a surprising ending. Generally was an okay read.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is awesome. you use crazy inators and it is very challenging. I think it is crazy cool. I am a serious gamer from California.
0307592731|4.0|I do like it (im still reading)....its like a part memoir and part fantasy and part thoughts/emotions/actions  we all experience on some level, but hardly ever admit to, much less  are any of us able to describe them and present them to the world. !!!!!<br /> Its amusing to read, at times laughable, at times way too descriptive, but overall good.  The only thing I didnt see/read was the \\"lesson learned\\", the \\"awakening\\", the 'wisdom'....so it is NOT like \\"Eat,Love,Pray\\" at all-especially since Julia's character had at least one thing extra Cheryl's character didnt and that being $$$$$!:-).....but if it is a memoir, then it is to be excpected that we dont learn a lesson actually at all in this lifetime.....and if it is fictionalized then we(the readers) long for that uplifting ending and feel denied if its not coming.<br />P.S. DOnt judge! since you aint bin in her shooz!!! just enjoy :-)

B004FA8NOQ|5.0|This processor is used on my home desktop and has been working very stable even on slight overclocking. The temperatures are lower than the previous i7-950 that I had, and performs much faster. I'm a power user and have a lot of programs that uses the CPU power a lot, and it helps to have the clock speed working at over 4.0GHz all the time without any heat issues. I use this CPU with my ASUS Sabertooth P67 motherboard with Corsair Vengeance 4GB x 2 DDR3-1600 RAM, with an AMD HD5870. Software that I use frequently is Adobe Photoshop CS5, and the processing time for applying effects appears instantly without delay, which saves me a lot of time.<br /><br />Even with the newer chips that are out now, the 2600K is still a great CPU for its price and fast enough to handle most of the average person's computer tasks. If you are not concerned with catching up to the latest technology and spending hundreds of dollars more, you won't notice a big difference between this and the newer Intel offerings such as the 3930K that my friend owns. I tried using his computer and the same photoshop software and didn't notice much difference, perhaps a bit faster on loading files than my own PC, but maybe because he also got a SSD operating system drive.<br /><br />I'll probably use this CPU for another 4-5 years until there is a huge speed difference with what's out there. Right now I don't see a need to buy the newer i7 models.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|it seems challenging at first but never really gets any harder. it is interesting and addictive though. I recommend for anyone stuck in Airports or waiting rooms often.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I went in with low expectations, and I must admit I was surprised. It is trashy in the most delicious way. I recommend it.
B0041KKYGU|2.0|The best thing to say about this movie is that it mostly avoids the failings of so many of Hollywood's comedic efforts. In other words, it isn't a gross-out, genitalia-laden, bodily functions-heavy, everyone-act-like-a-thirteen-year-old pile of audience insulting stupidity. It does have a few unnecessary shots, but those are quick one-offs that, while totally unnecessary, don't torpedo things completely. The comedy is certainly crude, but at least they go for acerbic instead of infantile. Given how many puerile offerings are being made, I'm taking what I can get.<br /><br />There's a host of vaguely familiar actors, but the best effort comes from the dead panning Jason Segel, doing his best Bill Murray circa the mid-80s as the P.E. teacher. Justin Timberlake never fully convinces me as the substitute the two main female characters vie for, maybe because he seems to be trying so hard in every role I've seen him perform.  Then there's Cameron Diaz as the main lead, playing against her normal cutesy characters as a slutty, ill-mannered, gold digging party girl who incredulously happens to be a public school teacher. The problem is that Cameron Diaz isn't Billy Bob Thornton so it was hard to buy her as the same kind of foul-mouthed loser he plays with such ease.<br /><br />Bad Teacher isn't a horrible movie, although it will probably offend those hand-wringing, paranoid, Helen Lovejoy-types who find any movie in which children are exposed to anything adult as the first steps on the road to the apocalypse. If you aren't one of those people, however, you might find some laughs along the way. From a teacher's perspective, there were some funny moments (the grading of papers, overzealous teachers, parent orientation), but the story has a lot of holes that simply don't make sense or stretch credulity too far, and thus prevent the movie from ever getting off the ground.<br /><br />Bad Teacher is tepidly recommended if you can preview it for free before buying.  2.5 stars.
B005EPFA8I|4.0|I saw this in 2-D via Amazon Instant Videos.  I'm so glad the cave is documented on film, and the interviews with the scientists and curators were interesting.  The narration was, in places, a bit too flowery and melodramatic for me.
0618918248|1.0|I wonder how much dough Dawkins drew from this Delusion !<br />Surely there must be  better ways for making money !
B00846REIS|2.0|this book is like a fifty shades replica with minor tweaks and changes, and frankly-not nearly as good.  Disappointed because I loved fifty shades and felt like these two books were just too similar.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The binaurals are worth getting and mixing two or more of them to produce that back beat which slides around in your head as your ears detect the beat and pulse.<br /><br />The amount of variety you get is worth supporting the developer. lets see what other sounds we can get.<br /><br />and I am not just saying this, I use this app every night since I got the free version. so yes I think it worth the price.
0345803493|5.0|Book came wrapped in plastic and in excellent condition. The shipment came when expected. The book was an easy read and fun. Excellent choice for a weekend read, read at the beach, or book club. Just have your man readily available for after the book is completed.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a first review for me and after hearing many thoughts on the book from the lunch room to the Dr Oz show, I had to read for myself. Of course it was a fast read that keep me wanting to read more. Kind of an adult Barbie and Ken novel, but like many romantic \fantasy relationships, the girl gets the rich guy. Which is so predictable. Then there is something left unanswered. How do you feel about child sexual abuse? How do you feel about corporal sexual punishment?<br />I do know from a reliable source that sales at a sex toy shop in our area have sky-rocked since this book is being read and more people are exploring their sexuality.<br />For me it is still a novel about a poor girl gets rich guy with a few extra benefits, some welcome, like electronic gifts, cars and glider rides. Some unwelcome like being punished for being an independant free thinking person.<br />I will admit ordering the next book as the story is interesting enough for me to want to find out if Christian Grey will miracuously gain understanding into his unusual erotic and (for me)kind of disturbing sexual behavior.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I tried only giving this app a half star but it wouldn't let me. This app sucks! It only worked about 5% of the time. The other 95% of the time nothing. When the app worked ig was great, but it really gets annoying to click on it, wait 3 minutes on a blank all white screen, and force it closed. So annoying!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|This album captures Yo-Yo Ma playing his cello to the various movie soundtrack themes written by Ennio Morricone. First heard these on Pandora Radio, and fell in love. Could listen to this anytime. Magical and outstanding.
B005SLS3ZU|5.0|Excellent book. Gripping story, easy to read, very well written. I couldnt put it down,  A true Micheal Connelly book.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time. All the songs are wonderful. They take my mind and soul to another world! I love the deep techno sound and the lyrics feel so meaningful. I LOVE BLACKOUT.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this is the best of the four I tried. I used the free version and have now purchased and will be keeping this one.
B007SWZVBQ|5.0|What can I say.  I am A Gleek.  I previewed all the songs before I bought the CD.  This is a very good Glee cast product.  Some very moving songs.  Shipment was standard but came very fast anyway.  I recommend the album.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I bought this in January and it's been used maybe 20 times. It started going downhill quickly and as of yesterday was unusable. It breaks down and shorts out I believe. It slowly started flickering and sputtering on the sound, and it had more static every time we used it. Sadly....dead. It was just used when we traveled but was great to have for my Macbook Pro, MacBook Air, and iPad.
B008MM9630|4.0|fun game with lots of things to do. cute characters and good graphics. fairly quick to get energy back. a bit addicting.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|was very excited about this season. can't wait for season 5 to begin. unhappy at the fact this was a brand new dvd and disc 2 skipped all the way through other than that really good will continue to buy from amazon
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|I'm always looking out for the app of the day that I will enjoy. This one definately counts! It is too cute for words!
034580404X|5.0|I didnt know what to expect when's started the series, I'm not a big book reader. Once I started the series I couldn't stop. It took me only 3 days to read all three books! AWESOME, AWESOME reads! Wish it were more then the three books :-(. Would highly recommend the series to everyone!
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I am not a fan of remakes in general a it is usually the same thing polished up but this game is just as fun if not more than the original game. I tip my hat to the development teams as they did a gear job. (MOTO RAZR 4.1)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|cool minigames... but no substantial gameplay. It would be better if it had a storyline perhaps. overall... I'd recommend. like it.
1937986047|5.0|This book is exactly what the title says - a guide to the X10.  The X10 is a very complex camera, with many different settings and menus.  The manual provided by Fuji gives a cursory description of  each item, but there is virtually no discussion as to how the function should be used.  Alexander White, in his book, discusses the functions in detail, and explains how their use translates into actual photographs, for which he provides examples.  As the title indicates, these photographs are in B & W, so it is not possible to see any colour rendering.  However, the B & W edition is significantly cheaper than the version with colour reproductions, and Mr. White indicates that he will send copies of the full colour exemplary photographs upon email request.<br /><br />The book is very well written and so is easy to read and explains clearly how each feature of the camera is used.  So far it has answered all my questions.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who has bought or is intending to buy the X10, especially for those people who are not very experienced photographers.
1419703692|5.0|This heavy book is a must have for every BATMAN addict! It is really the best compendium ever written about Batman movies. If you really want to read something cool this year about moviemaking...this is the right reading! Also, it is fully packed with awesome photos and great production stills! Grab a copy before it becomes difficult to find in the market!
B008MZU8R0|1.0|Rush, what can you say... I was extremely excited to see they were making new music..  then I listened to it, and I was extremely dissapointed.  Every song sounded the same, there was no differentiation  between songs.
B005LAIHRC|1.0|Oh boy! Where do I begin?<br /><br />Honestly, WHERE do I begin? Well, let me say this. The only, and I mean ONLY reason I went to see this movie was because it's a musical. I am a HUGE fan of musicals, especially classics like Singin' in the Rain and An American in Paris. But that's neither here nor there. I've not seen the musical that this \\"film\\" was based on. But I can already make the judgment that it is a lot better. I heard rather poor reviews of this movie, but I went in the theater hoping to like it.<br /><br />And.........(sigh) I want to be nice, but this is how nice I can be when summing up this movie.<br /><br />WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER HAD MY EYES WITNESS!!!<br /><br />Oh... God do I hate this movie. Now I have seen some bad movies in my lifetime. But as bad as they may be, they don't piss me off. This... piece of rat puke literally made me feel insulted. I'll try to sum up the \\"story\\" as best or worst that I can.<br /><br />It's 1987. Dreams and hopes run high for many. Especially young Sherrie Christian (Sister Christian? Get it?)She dreams to be an upcoming singer in Hollywood. Along the way she gets her luggage stolen and a guy named Drew, played by a thankfully unknown and hopefully forgetful to my psyche Diego Boneta, meets her as he tries to get her luggage back. So in an instant, no really, like 30 seconds, they start to hit it off and fall in love. Another of the many subplots in this flick has Russell Brand and, yes, Alec Baldwin trying to pay the bills so their bar/club named The Bourbon won't go out of business. There's also a West Side Story kind of subplot with Catherine Zeta-Jones trying to shut down the bar, as well as protest against the rock star Stacee Jaxx, played by Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Honestly, it pains me to write this review. I'm sure you're asking \\"Then why write it?\\" Well, I feel better just showing my pain and frustration through words from my laptop rather than scream my voice out in a boiling rage. As soon as the movie started, I knew that I was in trouble when Julianne Hough's character started to sing Sister Christian. After that, the movie went downhill...fast. Let me first talk about the performances. Julianne Hough is a decent actress and singer, but in terms of her singing, she sounds very nasally. And Sherrie, whom Miss Hough plays, is just your stereotypical supportive girlfriend/dreamer. God, I've seen more creative things done with Styrofoam than I have with her. In a nutshell, Sherrie is an ANNOYING character. Even worse is Diego Boneta as Drew. OH MY GOD! I HATE THIS GUY. Again, his character is the stereotypical boyfriend character who dreams for more in life. He makes the Disney Princesses look like good role models. He is a stupid, annoying, jack@#$! I hate his face, I hate his singing, I hate his character, I hate, hate, HATE him. I've heard things on the internet that girls swoon over Boneta. I don't think that he's that attractive. Bottom line; I LOATHE Diego Boneta's character and I can't stand Boneta himself.<br /><br />The highlight of the movie is Tom Cruise. I thought that he was brilliant in Tropic Thunder because he manages to blend into the role wonderfully. Here, he does that too. While he isn't as mesmerizing as he was in Tropic Thunder, it's another role he gets lost in and he does a good job. He also has a monkey in the film. That was also a highlight.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta-Jones is pretty darn bad in this movie. I've seen bits of her in Chicago and I thought she was quite good. Here, her talent is wasted. Just a bad performance, pure and simple. I really liked Russell Brand in this movie. Silly, but fun. I, like everybody else, couldn't take Alec Baldwin seriously in this movie. The moment he and Russell Brand started to sing into a hairbrush, I was done. Paul Giammati, however you say his name, is forgettable, Mary J Blige is wasted in this film, Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad fame is almost non-existent in this movie, the story is bland, the characters, aside from Tom Cruise's character, are bland, the versions of the songs done in the movie are making Glee look like The Beatles. The movie is just insulting. It's a cliched, formulaic, sloppy story. I should also note that in the beginning of the movie, as Sherrie arrives in Hollywood, I noticed that the filmmakers put the Roosevelt Hotel next to the Capitol Records building. They're insulting geography! I live over the hills from Hollywood, so I have been there so many times. So I managed to notice it instantly. There is also a scene in which Drew is shooting a very dated music video that looks like it was from the 90's. But the wardrobe they were is so laughable, it makes the costumes of Saved by the Bell look like something done by Hubert de Givency. Look him up on Wikipedia. He's a famous costume designer.<br /><br />This movie hurt my soul. I was laughing, but unintentionally. I was crying inside after it ended because it hurt me to think that this is a movie. Overall, this movie may be the worst thing I have ever seen. If this movie doesn't get nominated for Razzies, then I have no hope or faith in humanity or mankind anymore. Avoid this piece of filth.
0307730697|5.0|Great book, couldn't put the book down once I started it. True inspirational story and I like to thank all the men in women that give there life for are country.
B002AS9OZW|5.0|Their music is for anyone and uplifting for anyone who need a lift in their spirits.  I have purchased discs for my sister and a friend who had been looking for their track 'Home' but had forgotten the groups name.  She was very thankful that, on a whim I brought her home.
1468161660|5.0|The other reviews already say how I feel. This story is awesome.  I couldn't put it down. Definitely recommend this one!
B0055SWM08|5.0|nice way to pass the time. this is a good puzzzle game. I think it is worth 99cents. fun and challenging
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I lost all my progress and all the gold that I won and spent during the 34 levels and rewards. It is simply not fair. I wouldn't put my money in a game that does that to users.<br />Thank you
B001NY9YNQ|5.0|If you've never heard this album, you have no idea what you are missing. Tesla was a band from the 80's that was unfairly lumped into the \\"hair band\\" genre. On \\"Five Man Acoustical Jam\\" They took their heavy, often high speed, electric sound and tuned it down for a live acoustic show. With a mix of acoustic versions of their own material, such as their power ballad hit \\"Love Song\\", and covers that include The Beatles, The Stones, The Grateful Dead and CCR, this album totally rocks from start to finish. One of the high points and one of their best-known hits is their cover of \\"Signs\\". It's commercial success was the inspiration behind MTV's entire \\"Unplugged\\" series. If you like hard rock and have never just taken a chance on an album, this is the classic album to do that with.
1440503257|5.0|I haven't tried any of these yet, but all look good and the instructions are thorough.  Another reviewer has commented that this is \\"sit down\\" food, not party food, and that's true.<br /><br />The thing that gets this five stars from me is that most or all of the recipes could be made by middle school kids because of the clear, step-by-step instructions.  The only warning I'd give is that there should be an adult present to guard against burns because these recipes involve real cooking.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book, I read all 3 I would recommend it to mature adults it's def not for ppl wout imagination. The author is very vivid. Great read and def a page turner
0345803485|1.0|I thought I would give this book a try for a change in my usual style. It is sad that a book written on a 2nd grade level could be so popular. It says a lot about our society.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It's a great story and very well written. Once you start reading it, you don't wanna do anything else. The way the author approaches gender issues is fantastic.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|An excellent movie!  I always loved Johnny Cash and June Carter!!!  This is an excellent movie about Johnny Cash's life.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I have waited long enough for this News app to arrive on my Kindle Fire.  This the next best thing to USA Today.  BBC, you made my world a whole lot better now and please keep up the great work.  If you have to allow ads in the future, be sure to keep it minimal and non-invasive.<br /><br />To all my Kindle Fire fellas, hurry up and download this as soon as possible to feed your empty heads with decent news.  Cheers!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this so much. very user friendly. makes pinning easy and fun! seriously great! and free! would reccomend this app. :)
034580404X|5.0|The books are excellent.  I was intrigue by Christian past. Hope the author write a book about his first years and how he become a submissive. I recommend the books for men and women.
B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle is one of the 'BEST' books I have read.  I am so happy I decided to buy it.  You are not able to put it down for long
B00479SVBU|5.0|its' equalizer produces great bass. Easy to use. The only issue i've had is with scrolling the playlist using the navi button on the remote.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I just bought it, haven't even played it yet, but its Sonic!!! 5 effin stars!!! why would I even have a need to say anymore?
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read the second book in the trilogy looking to find out why Christine was such a mess....amongst other things LOL.  Although I did begin to get an insight into his character the repetitive nature of the writing quickly bored me.  Sorry it even bored me in the sex scenes.  I was beginnning to wonder if Ana's inner goddess couldn't just do a backflip out of there permanently, and / or if Christine owned a condom factory because he should have.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I read all three books but once I started it wasn't completely for the sex I really was looking for some depth which there never was.  She had some great ideas for depth but never explored or developed them. Which is really too bad because the author definately has what it takes to create a really good piece of nonfiction.<br /><br />Congratulations to the author first books out and a smashing hit....you my dear have obviously found something the female gender is not willing to discuss but definately looking for.<br /><br />Please don't quit writing Ms. James you have a talent....just find a better editor!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I love the game but they don't tell you what to do other than that I love it I could play all day
B000W25JUW|5.0|This Album NEVER grows old! One of the last times the Allman Brothers played together before Dwayne was killed in a motorcycle accident in Georgia, this Album Shows this Band at the very peak of their musical chops, and kicks ass from the first side and Statesboro Blues to pumping instrumental Hot 'Lanta followed by In Memory of Elizabeth Reed to the last side with the best ever version of their iconic song Whipping Post! From Dicky Bett's soloing with Dwayne Allman who plays both lead and slide guitars on this and at his very best that he could bring tears to your eyes as he plays here with such heart and soul, to the dual drummer set up that just pumps so much energy into this album ...If you could pick just one Album to save for this band, this would be it by far!
B0091XRL86|1.0|Uh, really?<br /><br />Okay, I'll be honest, I'm not part of the big \\"pirate\\" trend that happened a few years ago.  Honestly, I don't get it.  Glamorizing a particular type of criminal seemed odd to me when the trend started.<br /><br />That said, I really can't find any merit in this film.  It's very long and boring.  There's not enough plot to keep anyone's attention.  The scenes drag on and never really go anywhere.  There was one funny scene with a bathtub.  The rest are utter non-sense.<br /><br />Not to spoil it for anyone who chooses to waste their own time in this life... This movie is centered around the mushy emotional relationship of a crappy pirate and his crew.  That's why I say, \\"really?\\"<br /><br />The captain is not a ferocious and cruel type, and he's not heroic and loyal, and he's not even the ridiculously focused on, emotional and values his relationship type.  He's worthless and this movie is in character with the captain.  Add to that, the characters are not funny, and the lines are not funny either.<br /><br />The adventure type scenes are too ridiculous to be exciting, and end up boring.  The queen's character is too bizarre to be entertaining.  The only value was clearly in the animation and claymation style of film making.  I think the queen's character was created just for the animators pleasure, but surely not the audience's.<br /><br />Wallace and Grommit's, \\"the Wrong Trousers\\", is the only film they've produced that I thought was aimed at and entertaining for the whole family.  The rest of their films always leaves me asking, who was this aimed at?  Too boring for adults and older kids, and often scenes too disturbing and frightening for the youngest viewers, but not the type of storyline that would appeal to youngsters anyhow.  Maybe these films are geared for other film makers.<br /><br />This movie is so worthless, I hope you consider spending your family's time watching higher quality cinema.  It's hard to find these days, but it'sout there, good luck.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it is the best game ever I love it its the best game on my kindle ever it really is fun and I'm not just swing that IT IS
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is a riot, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />There are lots of funny scenes and great dialogue.  The film has really bizarre characters, which will appeal to and hold the attention of your most finicky movie watchers.  I think there are very few people who won't like this.  The over analyzing and sensitive types might not connect to the characters in the beginning of the film, or even feel concerned they're watching a disturbing movie.  By half way through, even they'll be on board, as the film has a great message and the \\"sinister\\" characters are beyond lovable, they're irresistible.<br /><br />This is great for the whole family.  Of course really young viewers may need a hand held in a few parts.  With the luxury of the home theater, you could pause it, and let the youngsters have a break or something explained.  I would say most 5+, will really enjoy this, and not find it unsettling.  There's enough explosions and kiddie style drama to entertain the middle school brother as well.<br /><br />So great to find a film that is entertaining for young and old alike, and leaves the audience with a good feeling.  Far too rare, as too many feel good movies leave you bored or with a sickly sweet feeling.  This movie does neither, you feel good because it was a well made movie with a great story line, original, funny, and has a great message.<br /><br />I hope other film makers really watch this film, and take the hint... this is the style of movie people give 5 stars to.  This is what audiences like.  Now make more, duh!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|At first I was discussed with the characters but still wanted to see what was going to happen next. I kept reading & it kept me interested into the next chapter & then book.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is a blast. Excellent time waster. It is challenging and exciting and really gets you thinking. Five stars.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|this is such a cute game but its still hard after the first couple of levels I wish they would give you more hints though...
B00881VLCE|4.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles, you will love this app.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is sometimes it is difficult to move the piece section to see all the available pieces.  Just takes a certain touch.  Overall I love it.  I could play it all day, in fact sometimes I do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a really compelling story.....and I am NOT a big fan of fiction.<br />Well written in \\"his story\\" / \\"her story\\" format.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought I wouldnt like Hungrer Games due to its popularity....<br />BUT<br />I am reading it so fast and love every single word...<br /><br />Cant wait to read the rest of the series...<br />THANKS, Suzanne for such a good read!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I tried to not buy this book for the longest time.  I finally decided to give it a try because of all the hype & because I heard it was going to be made into a movie.  I couldn't even finish it because it was so bad.  I only made it to about 25%. Characters were boring & the erotica was too much for me! Very poorly written. Please don't buy it. You will be dissapointed if you do.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|By the end of this movie, I felt as if I had not taken a breath during the whole thing.  At times, literally on the edge of my seat.  Twists and turns galore.  Just when you think everything is going to be OK, well, no, it's not.  Altho this got to be kind of old, esp. when people repeatedly did dumb things and certain plot twists didn't seem too plausible.  Between that and an incredibly clueless hubby, I removed one star.  Still recommend the movie, tho.
