B000RO9VJK|5.0|I just finished to read the book. The book goes directly to your heart,then goes to your brain and finally make your spirit awake up to the world.<br />The book is nice to read, but thE most important part is that the book is so powefull for the soul of the business.
B000089RV6|4.0|Purchase this because it is my favorite AC/DC album received it in a few days no issues to report anyone who likes kick ass rock would love it..
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thought it was a typically Grisham type of book, but through enjoyed it. It made you wonder how it would end, which is a good thing. But like many before, they sail off into the Caribbean. Or is that Patterson I'm thinking of?
B00BEXB18M|4.0|This cd is not my favorite but it does have a lot of good stuff here classic Megadeth with some new influences in there
B004ZN9OTG|5.0|Adam, he was my best mate circa 1969-70. He was a ginga cool kid living in Welwyn Garden City with his beautiful art teacher mum. Adam with monkey ripple soled shoes said &#34;Here listen to this&#34;. Pink Bloody Floyd! Now Adam knew I had a bad secret aka a John Sebastian album and a copy of “Bridge Over Trubled Waters”. He had “Trout Mask Replica”, Matching Mole and Soft Machine. Get the picture? He was so cool I was such a wannabe. On first listening to Atom Heart Mother I was not impressed. No sir! I thought “what a by-product of playing with yourself!” Being a lad after all and expert on such matters. But shucks Adam-you left me with a life sentence of listening to this and loving it. It was experimental, is multi-layered, mood enhancing without illicit substances and in parts rocks. It is an album of two sides and the first &#34;Atom Heart Mother&#34; definitely puts the pomp in pomposity. However, that is no negative as it works well. In particular that unlike many &#34;concept&#34; albums of the late sixties/early seventies the guitar driven symphony of Floyd takes you on a meditation of soaring moods and even the added sounds of car engines, gunfire etc. combine with the choral to create a full piece that is satisfying to the ear and brain. The second side is a series of songs which work in the folk rock idiom. &#34;If&#34; is one of those best sun drenched acoustic songs of the sixties-like Nick Drake on that traditional one English summer's day of the year. It was the first Pink Floyd album I owned and has remained over time a firm favourite. It makes a good bookend with &#34;Meddle&#34; before the forces of the &#34;Dark Side&#34; gathered on the top of the pops concept album horizon. And the Hipgnosis cover is a classic in itself.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Charges the BT headset FAST.  After an hour of charging , its ready for another 7 hours of talk time. Also holds enough charge over the weekend to keep the BT going, away from any power points. Keeps BT protected and easy to find.

B00EEDNA4M|5.0|If you, or someone you're buying for, are a fan of Breaking Bad then this is the collection to own. Every episode of this visually stunning masterpiece on Blu-ray, and several extras. The neat money barrel storage case can actually be left out as a conversation starter. I don't regret this purchase at all.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|It had more descriptions than I care and no sexual tension between Benton and Scarpetta.  Very interesting use of words and I had to look up a series of them, didn't like having the French not translated though I was lost.  It had a good flow, until she kept revisiting her past and comparing everything.  Great read if you like scenario descriptions.
B003B02OOG|5.0|My favorite short story was Blood Drive; reminds me of my escapades with my country cousins.  Fetching Raymond and Funny Boy were the most thought provoking.  Michael's room had a little Stephen King in it.  Fish Flies could also be called the Great Escape.  I enjoyed the other short stories as well.  Great read for quiet moments.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|A very good read.<br />This is a good book to curl up with on a cold winter evening by the fire
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|For the most part, it's a great relaxing game. Some missions are a little nerve-racking, but it's still fun. Various places to run through, various costumes to put on with different abilities. When I've got free time from homework and whatnot, it's my go-to game. I've recommended it twice and in both cases the people have also become slightly addicted :)
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Overall this is a pretty good album.  There are a few songs that i personally didn't care for but the worst part of it was some of the features.  A majority of the features on this album didn't have good voices and/or sing that well.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|Been playing this for months and months.<br />I have several versions from other sources that aren't as good as this.
B00BEF1AEK|3.0|I found this game to be really fun, however I got up to the second to the last section and my game was reset. The king was in the right place but all my completed levels were wiped out. I won't be playing until this is fixed, and that's why my rating is low.
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|If you want homosexual soft porn, then by all means, this is for you.  The story could have been told without all the sexual content.  So unfortunate that Liberace himself is not capable of providing his side of the story.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|And you don't have to. No big deal. I just got this today and just finished listening to it for the first time. I personally think its fantastic. The remix was a little short but who cares. Disc one is well worth the price of admission.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it!  Nothing better than free game that makes you laugh! Now if I can just stop falling off of stuff.<br />excellent work.
B001LOU8ME|3.0|While this recording is quite entertaining and has mostly excellent line up,this is ,as someone mentioned, no UFO. It is a good example of that The band as great as UFO is not just Schenker. It is a good played set, but you can not create the band out of session musician even great ones. Lack of UFO's songwriting magic shows and fine guitar solos would not make up for it.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Ridley Scott's return to the sci-fi genre that started his career garnered mixed response expecting another &#34;Alien&#34; or &#34;Blade Runner&#34; disappointed some of his fans but not this one.  While not the equal of these 2 masterpieces, this sci-fi thriller still holds his own  because Scott is reaching for more than just thrills---perhaps making a statement about mankind.  Also the acting is top notch with  Fassbender as David, the android and Rapace as then heroine earning top marks.  Also if you purchase this in  3D (I saw it in  3D IMAX) is outstanding, I don't understand why one reviewer knocked it maybe he was having a bad day.  Anyway grab this if you're in to sci-fi or a Scott fan.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I have been waiting years for a castleville game to come out for my kindle. It is my favorite zynga game ever but I wanted to be able to play it on a mobile device instead of having to sit up at my desktop to play it.<br /><br />My joy quickly changed to sadness when I found out that it is not compatible with my kindle fire. Why make a kindle game that isn't compatible with all kindle fire platforms? Please make this game compatible. I've been waiting so long!
B005HED11Y|4.0|The HD remaster is fantastic!  Incredible detail on the space shots, way better than I ever saw it on tv.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Did not read the instructions. Just plugged it and guessed. Worked right out of the box. I use the supplied mine 1/8&#34; audio cable. The FM transmission locks right it. I will buy an SD card and down load some music on it. I had a Livio unit previously, where I used the Blue Tooth function, it quit working so I returned it. I like the Livio app though that's still on my Android.<br /><br />One day when I feel like fooling around I'll check out the other features.

0812550706|5.0|Phenomenal book. Quick read. Complex characters. A really solid sci-fi book. I would recommend it to anyone that likes space and sci-fi novels.
B001BW02B8|5.0|This is my favorite Maroon 5 album! The vocals are strong. The lyrics are well written. And the music sticks with you. It does what every great album should do.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|This movie is a cult classic. It was filmed in the Las Colinas/Irving business area (near Dallas) in 1999. This movie is so very spot on, in representing office life as it was, an is still today, to some extent and all the bull and formality that entails. The boss man (Gary Cole) is hilarious as were a few of the other players that, by the way, were very instrumental in the success of the King of the Hill series. This movie is such a great reminder of the late 90s (better times), particularly when being from the Dallas area, like myself. The outdoor scenes are familar and the satire and humor is non stop. It is hard not to like this movie.
006097625X|5.0|Fantastic book! I co-taught a university graphic novels course. We used this as one of our required texts. This was a wonderful guide for the students. I always suggest this to friends who want to learn more about sequential art. Thanks for making a great book, Scott McCloud!

0938045768|5.0|Can you do pistol squats, one armed pushups, one armed pullups, one armed handstand pushups, standing to bridge then back to standing and hanging straight leg raises with PERFECT form and for multiple reps?  If you can't do any of the above, then this book can help you become strong enough to be able to do any of the above.  The great thing about this book is that virtually anyone can use this book for training.  The beauty of the system is the progressions that lead you up to the hardest exercises present in the book.  It even has tips for people who are recovering from injuries to help them rehabilitate faster.<br /><br />A little background information.. I've been hitting the gym seriously for about 4-5 years now (I started lifting at 15) and I've gotten considerably strong for someone my size, my average weight is right around 165 pounds.  I got to the point where I was deadlifting 375 lbs for reps, squatting 315 and bench pressing 225.  Even though I was satisfied with how my strength was going I noticed I was not good at any type of calisthenics.  Despite my lifts I still felt... weak.<br /><br />My motivation for hitting the gym slowly began to dwindle and I forced my self to keep lifting no matter what.  It hit the point where I decided I needed a change of pace and somehow I managed to stumble across this little gem.  I love the simplicity of the big six movements, they are the only movements you will ever need to get truly strong.<br /><br />When I first jumped in to this book I figured I would start somewhere in the middle of the progressions.. but I was wrong.  With the exception of the first progression for pullups, the first stage for all the exercises were actually really intense.  Wade explains it in the introduction but basically the form should be extremely strict with 1 second pauses at the top and bottom of each repetition.  This makes all the exercises considerably harder but it's one of those things that will pay off in the long run.  (One armed pushups with this tempo is going to be insane)<br /><br />The thing that is great about this is the amount of investment required.  I go six days a week with this (2 exercises a day, 3 times a week) and it only takes me 15 minutes.  Compared to weightlifting which took me 2 hours a day, 3-4 times a week I'm saving a lot of time -  plus I don't have to go anywhere I can work out at home now!<br /><br />Since it only takes me 20 minutes a day I plan on throwing in a couple cardio sessions a week (sprints, jump roping, bike rides etc).  If you're like me I hate treadmills, elliptical, stationary bikes.....  Anyways if you buy the book, read the introduction! The introduction is an invaluable introduction to calisthenics and I learned a lot from it.
B00FJ7YDV6|5.0|The book is actually awesome and my grandkids really like it.  I bought the &#34;free&#34; version and of course, halfway into the story, it asks if you want the whole thing for $3.99, which I bought because it was worth it.  It is fun and interactive.The child needs to help out at times and they loved it.  Don't do the free - pay and get the whole book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book was awesome. I highly recommend it. I liked every little thing about it. the details and the romance :) katniss
B002RXVOX0|5.0|Kept to the original story line written by Bram Stoker. Excellent acting and effects. We have watched this again and again.
B00GHJ1S2M|5.0|I love lady gaga and I've been wait three years for a new cd that is better then all me other CDs and just not from mother monster. I loc. it so much.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is very addictive. Once you start, there is no coming back. It could have been better if it were possible to buy coins with bananas, but the main reason for this game is to make money. Isn't it?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I couldn't put it down, it was impossible for me to do something else throughout my day lol. But if you like action and romance this is a book for you.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Damn ever since this game came for apple i've been waiting for  itto come out for android and now it has . This game gotta be the best fighting game ever released for mobile.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Still a classic, still great to watch. I LOVE Patrick Swayze. He's so talented and can really dance AND act. I'm so sad he's gone. He's such a blockbuster talent. Love Jennifer Grey in this too. She was so cute.

B00CZ7OC46|3.0|A good read, but nothing earth shattering content-wise. In fairness it had a lot to live up to after Rework
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|One of the best books I ever read. I ordered it because I generally like to read the book before I see the movie...
B005LN5UOC|5.0|This is a very nice Bluetooth headset that is a refreshing alternative to the huge over-the-ear headsets you find so often. I find that those sets, while providing excellent stereo sound, can be very tiresome after a while, especially when gaming over long periods of time. This Earset (I find it hard to call it a Headset) fits comfortably into one ear and even after several hours use remains very comfortable. I really can't recommend it enough for the PS3 gamer. I am not aware whether this will work with the soon-to-be-released PS4, but hopefully it will be. Otherwise this will prove to be a gadget with a remarkably short lifespan.<br /><br />One other comment. This is not just comfortable compares with other PS3 headsets, it is comfortable when compared with other Bluetooth single-ear sets. This has more padding than any other Bluetooth set that I have encountered. It really is a device that makes gaming a lot more fun.<br /><br />Now, if only it turns out to be PS4 compatible.
B008NIS2SS|3.0|These are early Bill Evans recordings, early because copyrights expire in the UK earlier than they do here in the US. And they're an attempt to be comprehensive (although some have said they don't have the complete albums of the ones shown on the cover). Because it's a series of early albums, and not cherry-picked best Bill Evans albums, you'd be interested in something like this if you were thinking of making a major commitment to buying his music (i.e., becoming a completist).<br /><br />This set is the wrong direction for that pursuit, because a lot of what's here is on the Complete Riverside recordings. If you already have that, or are considering it (in the interest of being a completist). scan the pictures of the albums: most of it is on Riverside. The Complete Riverside also has more outtakes from the territory within this set, so this set won't satisfy your completist interest.<br /><br />If you don't want to be a completist, don't buy this set. Read up on Bill Evans and cherry-pick some albums from his entire catalog, and be happy with those.
1742204236|4.0|Australia is an enormous country that offers the perfect blend of urban sophistication, natural wonder, and rugged, rural beauty.  In your reviewer's humble opinion, it is the world's best country.  I love it.  Always have.  Always will.<br /><br />Australia is endlessly fascinating, as the authors of this book readily explain on multiple occasions.  But all this Aussie lovliness also makes a good travel guide that much more difficult to prepare.  As the authors of this book have said, they've been writing about Australia for 30 years, and they could spend another 30 and still not cover it all.  A single-volume encyclopedia of all things Aussie, which this books attempts to be, is a very tall order.  Any such book will be necessarily summarized, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />It's a good book, but its coverage of urban and suburban areas outside the major cities is thin.  For example, Melbourne gets the kind of feature attention you would expect for a city of its size and importance, but the fascinating Victorian gold-rush towns of Ballarat and Bendigo get only the most summary review.  Also, the authors do appeal to certain stale stereotypes when describing the cities in social context.  Sydney is the easy-going beach town.  Melbourne is the artsy London wannabe.  Then there's progressive and snobby Adelaide; isolated, Mod-Oz boomtown Perth; sleepy Canberra, etc...  While there's some truth to these observations, they become less obvious with each passing year, and few tourists are likely to understand, or even recognize these cultural traits.<br /><br />Areas that stand out in this book are its treatment of outdoor activities, natural exploration and indigenous culture.  Australia is an absolute playground of all things natural, and this book is sure to bring your attention to that fact.  There's excellent content featuring, for example, the Great Barrier Reef, the Snowy Mountains, the Atherton Tablelands, Uluru, the fantastic national parks around Sydney, and (literally) hundreds of other beautiful natural locations.  The first time I saw the Blue Mountains, I was absolutely floored.  Not-to-be-missed locations like this feature prominently in the guide.<br /><br />This is a brand new book, so listings are right up to date (as of late 2013).  Hotel and restaurant listings are selective since it would be impossible to include everything, even everything good.  What IS included runs the full range of most rustic to most luxurious lodgings, from bushtucker to ultra-refined Mod-Oz cuisine, and includes many listings that offer a unique and authentic experience.  The listings of tour operators are particularly helpful, especially in tropical Queensland.<br /><br />Pragmatic information gives way to physical content in this book since Australia is an easy country to travel in.  There are some nice suggestions on how to survive extended treks in the bush and outback.  Historical and cultural contexts, likewise, are only there by necessity, and offer few real insights into the history and multi-ethnic culture of the country.  Anyone looking for a meaningful history of Australia should consult other sources such as Robert Hughes' superb colonial history, \\"The Fatal Shore\\" or Bruce Chatwin's \\"The Songlines.\\"<br /><br />This is a big, general guide book that covers the country well, particularly its natural wonders.y, and (literally) hundreds of other beautiful natural locations.

B0084B0656|3.0|As a nonbeliever, I found this book both interesting and frustrating.<br /><br />The most admirable quality of Orthodoxy is Chesterton's honesty about his motivations in accepting Christianity. He sees that the world is not as it should be, by which he means the magical and ethical qualities of the fairy stories he heard as a child. The book is his story of how he formed views on how the universe should be in order to satisfy him, how there must be an absolute standard for good and evil, an ultimate purpose to life, a great struggle against a mortal enemy (and so on), and how he eventually came to the realisation that old-fashioned Christianity met all these desires.<br /><br />Absent in the book is any attempt to claim or show that the tenets of Christianity are _true_ in a factual sense. One gets the impression that Chesterton doesn't much care about the question. Indeed, where he spends time defending Christianity against criticism he mostly confines himself to rebutting claims that it is _bad for society_ or _immoral_ rather than the claim that it is plain not true.<br /><br />Were he alive today (and much less erudite), one could imagine him saying &#34;If this is wrong, then I don't want to be right!&#34;, which is a lot better than believing it because it comforts you and then pretending that you have proof, so points for that.<br /><br />The frustrating thing about the book is, as you might expect, the old canard that if one is a materialist then one must necessarily be a nihilist. There is quite a bit of familiar stuff about how the materialist cannot appreciate the flower because he feels he understands it completely whereas the artist appreciates the mystery etc. One wonders if Chesterton ever spoke to an actual scientist in his enquiries. If he had, he might have discovered that the scientist _doesn't_ think that everything about the world has been explained, otherwise why would they go to work in the morning.<br /><br />One more example: At one point inthe book, Chesterton claims that a &#34;mathematical creature from the moon&#34; might observe that humans had two arms, two legs etc., infer a &#34;law&#34; that they had two of everything and then be plunged into an existential crisis on finding only one heart. Again, showing the confusion over how scientific enquiry actually works is amusing, as 'laws' are updated in the face of new evidence continually - it's kind of the point of the exercise.<br /><br />The last thing is the desire one has on reading to scribble &#34;[citation needed]&#34; on every page. The two funniest examples are the claim that all madmen are mad because of an excess of logical thinking and the claim that Europe is divided into multiple countries because Christianity values diversity and doesn't want to make the French and Germans too like each other. One can only hope that Chesterton's contemporaries (many of whom, like GB Shaw and HG Wells, he refers to in the book) called him on this rubbish at the time.
B000001GRZ|5.0|Always heard about Bach's Cello solo suite and this is one of the best edition! The recording (made in 1961) is very good. The sound quality is perfect. The performance is sensational. I will keep listening to it in the coming time.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|This movie is entertaining, fun, visually brilliant and completely unpretentious.  The special features on the Blu Ray are fantasticas well.  There's a great deleted scene where they have a song that my kids love.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book brought me to tears because I was in such a bad state myself......just like Katniss. And I could relate to her because I know how it feel to wake up screaming because if nightmares....I know how feel to have so much pain that you just have to block everything else out.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I liked the book, but I thought the first so had better plots and were more adventurous. Very entertaining series!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Addicting! Love that you can do bingo or slots. No other game comes close to this one. Just wish I was luckier.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was great book. I loved the characters and really connected with August, Jack, Summer and others. Overall a fantastic piece of writing.

(We're not all Rex Reed or Rona Barrett)<br /><br />My favorites, (so hard to say, 'cause they're ALL so good, and talented) are the urchins, It's SupperTime, maybe their sequin pumps...<br /><br />Must see musical ... The Best of the Best!
1400052173|4.0|I liked the book although it had a lot of repetitive technical information that was detracting from the plot line.  I would certainly recommend it.
B001NOOKH6|5.0|GReat all time classic, want a musical. Don't need to be Jewish, just gotta love the diva of all time. (Sorry, she does do justice to an important story in history) We Love!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The device works perfect, but it wont allow you to play anything that you already have... all you can do is play youtube (or netflix)<br />There are workarounds to play local media from a chrome tab, but the performance and quality is awful.<br /><br />The device itself is really powerful and I think google team made such limitation by design. A group of hackers had found a way to bypass those, but google released an update to quickly fix that .. it seedont work for local streamingms google does not want to let you watch whatever you want -- at least if they are not involved in the delivery process.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have now read this book three times. It is fabulous and I would recommend it to anyone who is into adventure.
B001BXO1PK|5.0|This is definitely a great cd. I think this is what the secret and other similar books are based off of.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Yet another story of Nazi, Germany, but this one through the eyes of a German girl who was not Jewish.  It is a  good read and I recommend it to anyone interested in that time of our world.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It looks like fun, but the video goes &#34;bonkers&#34; on my Android Toshiba Thrive - I had to delete it.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Cool game<br />I like it<br />It could use more guns more armor<br />Faster reload time is needed in my opinion
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've read this trilogy straight through four times in the past few years & still love it. I think a mark of a great story is when you continue thinking about the characters after you put the book down; I find myself thinking about these characters often. An excellent read.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|And it is great! As a long-time ZZ Top fan, it has been a long wait for new music. The last album, Mescalero, was not their best effort, but this represents a triumphant return.  Good to hear some good 'ol Billy Gibbons riffs. Looking forward to their next one. I only hope the wait is not too long.
B00FEMJF6O|1.0|I've been plying this game for a week and love it. But today I woke up to play and I'm stuck in a loop that leaves me unable to play at all. Game says they've made changes and I have to upgrade. It takes me to a popup window that says the preferred app site isn't available, so I have to go to the app store. At the app store there is no option to upgrade...just brings me back to the game that I can't play because I have to upgrade. Guess I'm done  playing Castleville Legends. Otherwise I would have given it 4-5 stars.
1476733953|4.0|Warning: This is an addictive read.<br /><br />I initially felt daunted by the large 500 plus page volume sitting on my shelf, especially because I had so many other books to review. I turned to the first page and read, “The children were playing while Holston climbed to his death…” and that was it. I was sucked in. When I looked again, I was on page 300.<br /><br />Wool takes you to a devastated, uninhabitable, dystopian world, where the very air you breathe will kill you. The few survivors live in underground silos and follow very stringent social and political rules. There is no room for freethinkers; there is no tolerance for curiosity.<br /><br />We are introduced to Holston, the silo’s sheriff, as he decides to follow his wife to ‘the outside’ and to certain death. Part one of Wool concentrates almost exclusively on Holston and I found this section of the book to be the most successful. I know Hugh Howey wrote this as a short story and it is enthralling from beginning to end. Despite knowing Holston’s fate from the onset, you still hope for a positive outcome, but it inevitably leads to the bleakness of the truth.<br /><br />The focus then shifts to a strong-willed and fiercely independent mechanic, Juliette, who is chosen as Holston’s successor. It doesn’t take long for Juliette to discover some shocking silo secrets, knowledge of which will ultimately send her to ‘clean’ the outside camera lens – a death sentence in silo terms.<br /><br />This is a completely gripping and engaging novel. There is always some action taking place, some secret being uncovered. And what makes it so terrifying is that this could be a plausible future for humankind.<br /><br />The biggest let down, and the reason Wool didn’t get 5 stars, was the romantic interest. Call me unromantic, but I don’t quite understand why Lukas is so distraught over Juliette. He sobs for days and he knew her for like 2 seconds. I could buy him being outraged and indignant, but come on, grow a pair! I was frustrated by his inaction too; he could have helped the revolution in some way surely? Perhaps I expect too much from my heroes.<br /><br />The film rights have been acquired by 20th Century Fox, with Ridley Scott expressing an interest in the adaptation. So read it before it hits the silver screen.
B00EOO1RHS|5.0|Instructions were clear and everything worked as it should. I can hardly tell it's there after applying the protector, I am extremely pleased with the product.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can give u 3 reasons to play this game 1 it doesn't cost any $$$ 2 its fun to play 3 its like temple run
B000000XB9|5.0|This is classic rock music and the best of CCR.  Takes me back to my childhood when my older siblings listened to it ...
0812417755|1.0|The one star is not in relation to the story itself.  I will not be reviewing that but instead in the actual book, hardcover edition by random house 9780812417753.  The book is small for a hardcover, but was expected from the description, but the binding is not tight, the pages are thin and fragile, typical of mass market paperbacks not hardcovers, and the pages and font do not go together well.  The paperback edition is much nicer.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|BEST MOVIE OF THAT YEAR, A DELIGHT, A TOTALLY ENJOYABLE MOVIE, REALLY GREAT AND WORTH WHILE TO SEE<br />A DE LIGHT
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|One of the songs on this CD is one of my husband's favorite songs and I purchased this CD as one of his gifts.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I'll be purchasing the Blu Ray edition.  Cloud Atlas was absolutely engrossing but you have to be willing to think just a little a little bit to enjoy it.  Cloud Atlas is six stories across an enormous period of time that are all interwoven.  Because the same actors appear in each segment it is easy to get caught up in trying to figure out which actors are playing which characters as the film moves from story to story (who knew that Hugh Grant could play a brute savage in war paint?) If you engage in tracking the actors then you will miss subtle points in the stories that are important.<br /><br />I am now reading the novel and this is one of those cases where I really do wish I'd read the novel first before seeing the film as I think I would have better understood - or at least caught on a bit quicker - as to what was going on.<br /><br />Entertaining, thoughtful and visually stunning.  I think this is a beautiful film and story that's going to get some negative votes simply because one has to THINK just a little bit.  This is not idle entertainment.  This film is waaaaaay better than the 3.5 star score shown here on Amazon - IF you don't mind a little thinking.  This is not mindless entertainment.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|A thinking man's show that normally moves along rapidly and is very compelling and entertaining. I like the development of the characters and the dynamic interaction between Moriarty and Holmes.
B00F37VHPM|3.0|Great show, but I don't understand why the single Blu-ray version costs more than the 3D Blu-ray, Blu-ray, DVD combo package. Makes no sense particularly for those who have no interest in the 3D version at home, although the 3D was great in the theater.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Helping someone plan a wedding and got lots of cute ideas.  Only problem is they don't tell you where to purchase the items shown.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Another brilliant look at a subject we take for granted. Leave it to Malcolm Gladwell to cast some much needed light on something we've always had a feeling was misrepresented. Being friends with some dyslexics, I've always known their affliction was at the root of their success. This book takes the magnifying glass to these tales. Bravo!
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|Very cool album.  Personally, I don't think there are any bad DT album.  Some are better than the others, of course; however, this one is very good, and I've been listening to it for awhile in my car now.<br /><br />If you're a DT fan, and has been from the beginning, you'll definitely like this one.<br />I especially like the lone instrumental in this album, the Enigma Machine.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Not the optimal wrap-up for this trilogy. If all 3 books get made into films there will need to be some retooling done. Nonetheless, Roth's characterizations and developments are sublime.
B001O54NKS|5.0|Very cool album.  Brought back a lot of memories too.<br />I'm in the process of changing my tape collection into CDs, and this is one of them.<br />This is probably Dokken's best album, if not, one of the better ones.  It's understandable that this is the album that has the highest number of sales out of all Dokken albums.<br />There are so many rockin' songs in here, and of course, Lynch's solos are just plain kick-ass.  Nobody can play like he can.
B00FAVRFXE|5.0|This was an amazing special. Will make you laugh, cry, and make you even more excited for Doctor Who to come.
B008JFUPOY|4.0|Highly entertaining for both kids and adults.<br />It's very fun, but not as good as the first one, so I took away one star.
B00FQPHA0M|5.0|As a huge superman fan, this is by far the best ever made. Characters are believable and they finally have an actor willing to work out to become a convincing man of steel. Still love the old Christopher Reeves movies too though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its Addictive love love love it cant put my kindle down . Its just as if im playing it on my pc and u can sync it with Facebook so u dont have to start all over if u like ,
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I found myself not able to put the game down after I started. It is ad<br />dicting and so mulch fun. Yes, the story is long winded, but it is a great adventure if you take the time to read it, otherwise you can skip the reading and just play the puzzles. I would highly recommend it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as the first. Some parts of the book seem they were stretched out to just take up space. An easy read and a thriller but at a few parts it just seemed like words were wasted.
B00GIZO674|4.0|If you liked this on the computer, you'll like it on the Kindle.  Good game play and lots of levels.
B00004TS0E|5.0|The DVD did not work but was replaced quickly.  There were no hassles and all was completed online. [[ASIN:B003EHLCWQ The Miracle On 34Th Street]]
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Mastering the levels is challenging. And finding special items adds to the exploration. This game keeps me coming back for more.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This is a fun way to kill some time.  Plays just fine on kindle fire hd.  But this is a 100mb game not 1.8 as listed. Therefore I feel the need to take one star away for that.<br /><br />no Wi-Fi required.<br /><br />As an update, I the computer player are programmed to get rid of it's high point cards 1st.  So it will always play a wild weather there is another play, especially the draw four.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|Have been using this for the past few weeks, primarily for Grand Theft Auto V (a must) and it is quite impressive for the price.  If you are one to break or lose expensive headsets or just don't see the need to invest in such a thing, this is completely fine and works perfectly.  My primary headset is the PS3 Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headset which is great with dual ear cup and extended mouth piece.  But, with too many wires and a complete pain to setup.  With the Gioteck EX03, it's a simple bluetooth earpiece that connects instantly and works without issue or interference etc. I like the easy controls and easy to adjust while in ear.  Quick to mute or shut down.  Small enough to store in an eyeglass case.  I have the 3ACTIVE Twin Storage Case where I store my 3D glasses which has small pockets, and it fits the headset and it's charging cord.<br /><br />I like the fact that it separates the potato chip munchers and keeps the game audio out of the headpiece.  So great to ignore the ignorant with a click.<br /><br />Yes, this is really cheap, but in this case, you get more than you pay for.  It's certainly a great backup set while your main set is charging, but honestly, I have used nothing but this headset since I got it because it's just so much easier to deal with.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Even though this is a demo and it has a timer. Just do things quickly and it will be fun
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist is what brought me back from getting laid off from two jobs in 6 months. It re-energized my soul and spirit to continue in my pursuit of my own personal legend. This is definitely a must read for all.<br /><br />Since this book I have read; The Zahir, The Aleph, The Warrior of the Light, Accra, and now on The Winner Stands Alone.<br /><br />His books are easy to read and feel so personal. I have cried through some but felt so good afterward. Thank you Paulo!
0316055433|4.0|Yes, a modern Dickens, with characters from our world today.  Wonderfully absorbing.  Thoughtful.  It will change the way I look at objects, not just art.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Hey guys!<br />I spent a few months in the US and learned about Breaking Bad.<br />I loved the show and would like to buy this complete series package.<br /><br />There is only one question for me:<br />Is it possible with this disks to watch the episodes in German? What languages can you chose when you start watching?<br /><br />Thanks for your help guys!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|Great action packed movie but not very close if you are a Superman follower. I was quite disappointed with the deviations.
0060005696|1.0|While I did like the book in the beginning, and I saw that most of what he was saying was true, I realized that there was too much fluff in this book. This subject is not so worthy of exploring it deeply.<br /><br />I mean, it's pure common sense when you think about it. It is clear that the author wanted to make the book long, especially considering that most people think that the longer the book is, the more valuable it must be. Even though the contents of this book are good, he still over-complicates this issue and delves too deep into it.<br /><br />The point of this book could be summarized in one big article and everyone would get the point. It seems that the author had stumbled upon this niche that no one has written about and wanted to make money off of it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Ok so it's all right. I love candy crush but it doesn't come with instructions or what things do. That would be helpful. It's all right though. They have hard levels
006202406X|3.0|I'm not a famous author or a respected critic, I am only a teenager who fell in love with Divergent while it was still an unknown book. I will not bash on this book or completely tear it to pieces like so many reviews do, I will only give an opinion. I gave this book a three out of five even though I give both Divergent and Insurgent a five(maybe a four point five for Insurgent). I will not lie, Allegiant was not what I expected. My reasons:<br /><br />1. Characters: somewhat unrealistic and out-of-character. Sometimes I felt like the main characters stopped developing and gaining more depth. Side characters did not have much depth as well. Nita and Matthew were not as well developed as Al or Johanna.<br />2. Dual POV: sounded very similar, often times I would forget who was talking. I read Four's POV of a chapter from Divergent(story is titled &#34;Free Four&#34;). His voice was so distinct but in Allegiant his voice blends intoTris's.<br />3. Complicated solutions: the reason for the factions was to correct genetic damage, I often felt as if the explanation was drawn out and not pulled together into one thought. &#34;My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations&#34; -John Green. This quote is how I felt about the explanation.<br />4. Easy circumstances: Chicago is under lock down from within. When Tris and others try to escape it was too simple. I feel as if one death was incorporated to make the escape seem more difficult. It wasn't difficult, there was one guard when the whole city was under lock down.<br />4.2: ****Spoiler**** At the end when Four tries to convince Evelyn and Marcus to stop what is happening the battle was easy. They both just forgot their reasoning for what they were doing and how determined they were. Every villain should be a hero in his/her's own mind. Convincing them to change should be just as difficult to get Tris or Tobias to change sides. Maybe more.<br />5. Senseless deaths: ****Potential spoilers, skip whole section.****We've all heard how disappointed the end was but honestly I don't mind main character deaths as long as it's purposeful. I love The Fault in our Stars so that's proof that deaths don't make me hate a book. In Divergent it made sense why Al would die. It made since when Tris's parents die. There was purpose and honestly I understood and accepted it easily.<br />Deaths are lifelike, yes. But good guys win too and bad guys sometimes lose. It's called life where everything happens for a greater cause. Do all protagonist live? No. Do all antagonist lose? No. But there is a middle ground where some live and some lose. The middle ground was lost, there needs to be middle ground.<br /><br />I love Veronica Roth. She's quirky, hilarious, and seems like a wonderful person. She made two of my favorite books that I will always remember. I don't know why people completely bash on her. Sure, the last book wasn't what the fandom expected and we honestly do not like it, but when she comes out with a new series I will read it, perhaps buy it because I like her. Writers grow with experience and this was her first widely-popular book. There was a lot of pressure but I know she'll continue to write amazing books. I hope that I can write books like her one day. To end this let us not forget the good parts of Allegiant. Even if we disagree you cannot deny that you regret reading it because it's our fandom and we will stick through it till the end. &#34;Be Brave.&#34;

B0036S4B6M|3.0|One of the many vignettes: Piper has so many friends and family willing to visit her, she has to juggle their names to fit -- the prison limits her to 25 visitor names at a time. Eventually, the administration relents, and she can just make one list with everybody on it.<br /><br />There are several ways to read this vignette and this book. One can read it as a story of privilege; not everybody has transportation and time to visit Danbury so often. Piper acknowledges that, but still, it's cloying. One can read it as a personal brag. Or one can pick up the how-to tip: if you ever find yourself in prison, then it's vital to have a strong social network. How many family and friends do you have that would stand by you if you went down? And conversely, how many people would you keep faith with and visit if they were locked up?<br /><br />Similarly, Piper drops a few scant tips about talking to people inside prison (it's okay to ask how much time; it's not okay to ask what for; and you need to very cautious with people before talking about anything important) -- but again, it's wrapped in a layer of &#34;I get along with everybody because I'm humble.&#34;<br /><br />Another thing bothers me more: the incompleteness of a lot of narrative threads. Piper mentioned that she got up to 30 miles per week on the running track, with a pace of 7:00 per mile (at least part of the time). That's actually some pretty serious running. What did she do for shoes? Was she able to go out to the track any time she wanted, or were there rules about it? Did the COs ever try to manipulate her by cutting off her access to the track?<br /><br />Similarly for the time she re-encountered some of the women in her drug ring (also in prison). She describes her initial reaction, but barely describes the conversations they had and their outcome. Those must have been some helluva conversations over the time they were forced together.<br /><br />At the end, Piper lists some organizations that work on behalf of prisoners. But she doesn't list any other prison memoirs. This is one person's memoir, and it's partial. You'll have to read other books for a picture larger than one person.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|Great CPU for the budget gamer. Would do great as a HTPC as well! Very fast and easily over clocked! I have it running on a MSI FM2-A55M-E33 motherboard and its eating up any game I throw at it. Running 6 gigs of DDR3 @ 1333 Mhz and a Geforce 1 GB GT 610. Great CPU!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like I said before, the best show on TV.. Can't wait for season 4 to begin. Definitely something worth watching over and over again.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Was looking for a simple storyline-ish game and I saw this one. Simple commands and good art quality.  Would recommend to my friends.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Good movie but the end was not good.  I think the main character made more jokes in other movies and this was a little boring at times
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game, totally addicting. I think the only problem I had was a few weeks back it said I couldn't play, it was like that for a few days.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great graphics and ad free!!!! Makes for wonderful hunting without freezing lol nice beginners game very easy to navigate and understand what you have to do
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|As others have said, the book was somewhat interesting, but the main &#34;argument&#34; was poorly supported.  Gladwell selects a handful of anecdotes that seem to correlate with his theme that small/nimble/clever is superior to large/lumbering/stupid (hardly a revolutionary concept to anyone who has studied free markets or libertarianism), but these examples don't rise to the level of proof, and he doesn't really bring any new thinking, scientific method, or philosophical illumination about this concept to the reader's attention.  The book ends up being a collection of unrelated stories of modest interest.  I found it a much less rewarding read compared to his previous books.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Very very fun. I can't stop playing the game!!! I would definitely recommend this game to my friends and others to play
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Never disappointed by Messrs Preston & Child & this is a good addition to the Pendergast series! Looking forward to more
B00782O7IY|5.0|The movie is excellent.  I wish they'd make more silent movies like this.  I love watching the original silent films; pantomime is so important to convey emotion.  The Artist is just a lovely movie.  The dog deserves an Oscar.  This is a rare film because it's entertaining, it's fun, and it's safe for the whole family.  I have started buying French films because they are so good at telling a story, and being funny or romantic without being sophmoric and slutty.<br /><br />See that!  Great films can be made without vulgarity, cars exploding or bedroom scenes.  It just takes a little class and imagination.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|well written but the story goes nowhere, wish it had a climax and resolution. its pleasant and easy reading. I expected more.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Simply awesome.  THe best game about racing. NIce graphics. DOn't forget to buy new cars, otherwise it is really pass to defeat the whole season.
B005ERX1Z0|5.0|This will be a stocking stuffer for my husband he is a huge Jackie Chan fan, he has almost all of his movies except this one. Can't wait to give it to him :)
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's castleville for your kindle/android! Can't beat that. If you enjoy the Facebook game, you'll love this. I'm impressed so far. I might even go as far to say it's better than the FB version.
B00EO2I6XS|5.0|Like [[ASIN:B004KCAYXC Vision]] (the previous movie by Margarethe von Trotta starring Barbara Sukowa) this is a fantastic movie with a serious flaw. But in both cases, the flaws have nothing to do with Sukowa, whom I had never heard of before Vision but who I now see is one of the world's greatest actors. She is perfect in both roles, in both movies. Since she dominates both movies, she is so good that she earns the movies five stars from me despite the serious flaws.<br /><br />The flaw in this movie is that many of the supporting roles are filled by terrible actors, and they're so bad that they can't be ignored - when they're on screen they completely derail the movie, and it doesn't recover until Sukowa returns and they leave. The very worst of those incompetent performances are by actors (Megan Gay, Harvey Friedman and Janet McTeer) who have been thoroughly competent in other movies, so the problem must be with von Trotta's direction of them.<br /><br />The fact that all three characters are Americans (only one of the actors - Friedman - is) probably isn't a coincidence. Von Trotta evidently doesn't have much sense of how Americans tick, or even talk, so she doesn't quite know how to create credible American characters in a movie. Germans - of any era - she does great; Americans: no.<br /><br />A secondary but related flaw is that she should have hired an American production designer. I understand why she filmed all the New York interior scenes (which means practically the whole movie) in Germany, but, unfortunately, they all LOOK like German interiors, not at all like real New York interiors, even in the early 1960s.<br /><br />Although I'm very glad she made this movie, if she plans to continue filming American stories she really needs to get help from people who know how to create a believable America and believable Americans on film. She's a great director, but she needs help if she intends to keep making movies about America.
1401937519|5.0|A great recounting of her encounter with terminal cancer and her miraculous recovery.  Interesting for me was her description of merging with the experience of others, being her brother as he flew in to visit her at her death bed.  I have experienced for myself being able to have the direct experience of others in dreams and meditation and this was the first time I had seen it being described by others.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Kid loves the first movie which we watch all the time. This is a great sequel and nice disc options for BD, DVD, and digital streaming viewing.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I like the way that John Grisham tells his stories. I feltI like I was a part of the story.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Kid loves the first movie which we watch all the time. This is a great prequel and nice disc options for BD, DVD, and digital streaming viewing.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I am finding this game addictive.  Full of beautiful graphics and interesting characters.  As long as I don't have to purchase anything like crowns, it might be one of the best games I am playing.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|it would be better if there wasent a bug to where I cant get any region 2 or 3 guns but if they fix ignite perfect
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game and recommend it for all ages and. It is so fun and will keep you interested and its fun for me and I'm a 10 year girl.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A refreshing account of similar stories we know and have read. A horrible part of history enlightened with happy tales told by a very unique narrator throughout. It's great to read about the love and hope intertwined with such a horrific part of history. My only wish would have been for a slightly mire developed ending. The story built up great all throughout but ending came on too suddenly. That is probably only because I became so attached to the characters. Job well done. I will definitely read more by this inspiring author.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Loved this series. Authentic, complex, captures your interest, actors look like real people, great location shots. What's not to like
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very good game. helps time pass by when you are bored. I would recommend it to everyone.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Do you have to ask! I have watched Adam since American Idol. I was born in 1946, but boy, he keeps me &#34;rockin&#34; like I was a teen again. Amazing talent, and easy on the eyes, too. As a fan of Queen and Glee, I am living La Vida Loca!!! right now.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Do you know who creates these games?  The homeless!  Every time you turn around, they're asking for a dollar.  Game play is unfair:  the game says no more moves, when clearly there are more moves.  The game is designed to pick your pocket one dollar at a time.  Addictive? Maybe for those bozos that want to lose money.  However,  if you're looking for an expensive addiction, I recommend drugs. At least that gets you out of the house and socializing.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|I thought it was funny and good, but wish I had longer to watch it, because I fell asleep and went back to watch it the next night and finish the end and couldn't.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|It is quite a sad story. You get to know Anne and the families living with her and when it is over it is almost like your own family dies. I have very much of the same feelings Anne does towards her parents so I really was able to relate to her. It was almost a distant friendship. The whole three or so years of hell the families went through is unbelievable, knowing it actually happened. I wouldn't recommend this book for children 14 and under. Some details are for the more mature.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|i know the game is cool because I played it on my friends phone but it want let me play I don't know why
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I enjoyed playing Castleville but it got too unwieldy. I was pleasantly surprised to find this app, which is all the fun of Castleville, without the bulk.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|the game is great. the find the pairs and find the differences you need to be able to zoom or pan. the objects are too small sometimes that makes it even harder to find them if you have bad eye sight like me.  I am going to give this a 4 mainly because of the zoom problem.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Again I bought the Blu-ray, DVD & digital copy.  It has lots of extras that weren't in theaters.  It is a heartwarming and funny movie.  This movie presents the story of how two mismatched monsters met and became lifelong friends.  Ever since college-bound Mike was a little monster he dreamed of becoming a scarer.  He knows the best scarers come from Monsters University (MU).  But in the first semester at MU, Mike's plan change when he meets Sulley, a natural scarer.  The  pair's out of control competitive spirits gets them both kicked out of the MU elite Scare Program.  They realize they have to work together, along with other odd bunches of misfit monsters.  They do make things right.  This has bonuses, including an inside look at the monsters world and an animated theatrical short film.  I recommend this for the whole family.  It is hilarious.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun and kept me wanting to play more. 5star game in my book. look forward to playing any chance I get.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|When the book started, I wasn't thrilled with finding young Danny in such depressing circumstances. Logical, believable, yes, but it felt unfair. By the end of the book, I came to believe that this is probably how King felt as well. The affection for Dan Torrance, and the gratitude for AA shine through.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Old time favorite.  If you love White Christmas, you'll adore this.  A must have for anyone who loves Christmas movies.
B00BPQYWSO|5.0|This is probably my top album of the year. James Blake is an amazing musician. I'm already ready for the next album.
B00AF1ERXU|5.0|THIS IS WHAT I NEEDED MORE THAN WHAT I ALREADY HAVE. I HAVE MANY USES FOR THIS GROUP OF ITEMS
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like playing, however this game is more frustrating than most. Some levels are a lot harder to get through than others.

B0019NB9A2|5.0|I bought the Blu-ray version to replace the HD-DVD version that I'd originally bought several years ago when X-box had an HD-DVD player accessory (this was before HD-DVD lost the format war -vs- Blu-ray). No disappointment, the Blu-ray version is better --
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun to pass the  time All the links don't work<br /> Takes too long to get gems Says there is an error
B003UESJH4|5.0|The movie won the Best Picture and I knew I couldn't go wrong... and I didn't. This is one great movie with an exceptional cast.
B00GD9F59S|4.0|Great series. This book starts right where the last book stopped. I feel the writing turned more juvenile and the final ending simply explained......
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|WONDERFUL. I am a huge Star Trek fan and Trekkie so of course after seeing in the theatre I had to add it to my collection. I've watched it several times since and enjoy it every time.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Excellent story. Interesting to see so many famous singers with their music arrangers & performers & the start to become famous.
B0042816YK|5.0|I saw it on the big screen and loved it and so had to have it for my collection. It is so enjoyable I've watched it over and over.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I completely love this game . It's time consuming and fun :) It kid safe and it has a mature touch to it as well ... download it to play it.
B0000640SB|5.0|I own MIB and MIB II and needed this to complete my collection. I hadn't seen it in the theatre and enjoyed it immensely. Josh Brolin as a young Tommy Lee Jones was unbelievable and should have gotten an award in my book.
B0091VYG86|5.0|Pleasantville features a great cast, great writing and direction, great music, humor, historical and societal allusions and tugs at your heartstrings. It's worth viewing a second time and even a third.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Excellent movie. My daughter had a bit part in it and that, along with the fact that I enjoy these types of movies made it extra special for me.
0802473156|5.0|Love this book. The two most important messages are clearly conveyed and amazingly easy to grasp. Love people in the way that fulfills them...not the way you think they should or in the way that fulfills you. If he likes steak and you like chicken that's great if you recognize you have different likes and what fulfills them. Same with love language, maybe your love tank is filled by physical touch, but his is affirmation. Understanding these allows you to show your love to someone using their language and help them understand yours. It applies to your marriage, but also your relationship with your parents, your children and close friends. It's just a simply fabulous way to understand how to give and receive the love we all want and need.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Heard about it from my friend. He was right, it is fun. I like that it is a very realistic game.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love this book. I am good about diary of a wimpy kid books. This is a good one. Jeff Kinney went all out this time.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Red 2 is hilarious!! It's the perfect combination of action and comedy. I've never seen an action movie as entertaining and I recommend it wholeheartedly!!
B00BGI08GG|1.0|I'd like to know what drugs those people who gave this series 4+ stars are on because clearly I need to be using them the next time I even think about trying to give this show a shot. The only thing this show has going for it is the eye candy, and even then it isn't even worth the loss of braincells in the end.<br /><br />The fanboys (or girls) who wrote this series are constantly grasping at straws when trying to figure out which villain from DC they want to throw in next, and if they can't get the exact rights to use said character, they seem to have no problem butchering another, and combining multiples together to make a new atrocity.  The cast has no chemistry.  The acting is shoddy.  The leads are whiny and annoying.  The plot goes from one extreme to the other in all of one episode.  There are loop holes, there are loose ends, there is a love triangle that makes Jerry Springer's interview panel look sane.  It's quite obvious that this show isn't intended for those who grew up reading the comics, or having an idea about them.  It's aimed for housewives, and high schoolers.  How it got a second season is beyond me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Yes, this is the type of game I am familiar with and love the way it can help you make moves.  An old favorite and the best
B00332CWLW|3.0|This had been recommended to me and when I started reading it I thought I might quite enjoy it but I didn't really in the end and found myself barely glancing over sections of text just to get through it.  I know others who did enjoy it so it's probably just not my cup of tea.  I thought it had the makings of a really good story but that kind of got lost along the way with too many characters getting involved but at the same time not really involved, just on the periphery.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|All of Alien's movies in Blu Ray!!!  I really like this compilation.  These movies have been cleaned up and even have the director's cuts on some.  I really only cared for the first and second movie but having all of these is worth it.  Highly recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Don't buy this product. Google does not honor the warranty unless you purchase an additional service called a Google Wallet which requires that you give Google your credit card information. I bought three of the suckers - two set up okay and one is an expensive chunk of plastic. The product's hype is far greater than it's performance. With any mobile device, you are pretty much limited to Netflix and YouTube. Google is keeping third party developers from letting you view local content, such as your own PowerPoint presentations or recorded/purchased content. Stay away.
B000TETM7Y|5.0|Classic #1 is followed by Voodoo which is classic #2.  Must haves for the soul music lover. It is sad this voice has not produced more for us to love.
B00AEBB8PQ|4.0|Light, fun, happy ending stuff. Robert De Niro is a riot. Michelle Pfeifer, as always, makes a great ...uh... witch. Big stars in character roles not afraid to be ugly. I watched this on Amazon prime for free but bought new as a gift for a &#34;Star&#34; themed  Christmas basket. Thankfully, arrived with case intact, no holes or scratches.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Helpful in reading messages and articles created in PDF form.<br />I fund this makes keeping up with important information an easy task.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome! Not to hard although there are a couple of challenging levels but, other than that it is great!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I like the historical look and insight this book gives. Stays true to fact unlike so many books about Jesus.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|This game is very fun and i would recommend this game to all of my friends.  The only negative thing about this game is that there is a limit on how many times you can play until you charge up again. And that takes time
B00080Z53O|4.0|Javier is an amazing actor and his range is really on full display in this movie. This story touches upon our basic desire to live life as we see fit.

B00BSBY38A|5.0|Adventurous and exciting tale of a boy's experience at sea that helps the viewer evaluate his/hero own fears and how we choose to confront them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! I am actually glad they time you out...otherwise I might be on it for hours!!!  LOL!!!  =)  Try it... you'll like it!!!  =)
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is perfect in every way. I love playing it. It's graphics are great, as well as its  AI.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Felt a strong need to read before seeing movie. SO MANY emotions expressed in this book. Far too many to count. Have read many from this time period, many true, and not. This now stands out as my favorite. Would recommend for others!! SO well written and like how narrated. Completely differently done than any other book I've read. PLEASE, READ!!!
B003JUGQ38|4.0|You do not need to be a loyal fan to understand Season 4.  Special effects were fun and not cheesy as in the past. Great entertainment.
0804162727|5.0|Great product! Definitely a special edition. I saw the plain strategy guide prima sells and while it's got the same content, it's a soft-hardback book, the pages aren't gold, but are non-colored, and the price for the lower-quality guide was around the same. For $20, this was a steal! Almost makes me want to purchase the 5-book set they have here:<br />[[ASIN:0804161380 The Legend Zelda Box Set]]<br /><br />Overall, it was a great product and came with a cool map and lithogram of the Master Sword. Thanks Prima!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good story and great ending combined with social relevance about race relations in the United States and in particular the South. Involves one immediately.
B004UID2LC|5.0|it works well - downloading and playing youtube videos with no bugs. very easy to download and navigate. I would definitely recommend.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Akinator guesses right about 90% of the time, and it seems to be learning about the characters that it's stumped by! Fun little game
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Excellent ending to the Hunger Games. The only criticism I have is that some of the events are summarized by the characters. I would have like to see those events played out in real time.
B0001RVQM8|5.0|Biss is making a great name for himself in the piano world, and rightfully so.<br /><br />It would be easy to speak of the musical legacy Biss holds as a background....his paternal grandmother was  one of the first well-known female cellists, the Russian cellist Raya Garbousova, for whom Samuel Barber wrote his cello concerto. She premired the work with Serge Koussevitsky conducting.<br />His parents, Miriam Fried and Paul Biss, are both violinists. After studying at Indiana University, where both of his parents teach, Biss entered the Curtis Institute of Music at the age of 17 to study with Leon Fleisher.<br /><br />All that aside, Biss is a formidable pianist, and this disc of Beethoven and Schumann  offered as his debut recording shows a promise that he has held up to over nearly a decade now. The recording chronicles his first recording of the Beethoven &#34;Appasionata&#34; Sonata, and the Schumann Davidsbundlertanze.<br /><br />The understanding of the music is apparent, and he possesses a beautiful technique to handle the selections. Most of all, Biss performs with taste...and a maturity which seems well beyond his chronological age.<br /><br />Keep an eye on this artist if you don't know him...he is truly one who is here to stay.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|A little disappointed it wasn't like the original. But over all good game! I like that they used a lot of the same characters.
B00BATG18K|2.0|This is a true disappointment from one of my favorite authors.  The book rambles, much of it doesn't hold true. The marriage and trip to the center of China is ridiculous for such an astute, bright businesswoman. The descriptions of the art of the painting of the Valley of Amazement were weak. Very week, rambling epic.  Best part was to finish it.  I hope her next book is of the same caliber as her last!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, even though I figured out the secret.  In the end, though there were still some surprises.  If you like some light reading, written well, easy to read and enjoy - this might be for you.
B00CEB5QU2|1.0|DEVICE IS NOT SECURE - DATA BREACH Waiting to happen<br /><br />I purchased this device to be able to store extra data for my iphone / ipad. I specifically picked this Kingston product (MLW221) over other vendors as it has the ability to act as a wireless network bridge so I can have access to the data on device and access the internet without changing what wireless network i'm connected to.  Sounds great.<br /><br />One VERY LARGE problem.  There is no protection for the device from the internet side.  It's wide open. If you connect the  device up to a wireless network so that you can get to the internet, anyone with the external IP address can access the device and your data. All that has to be done is point a browser at the internet address of the device and you can see the data, enter and change the configuration options, etc.  (To be fair the URL of your data files is presented with the inside address of the device, but if you copy the url and change the address to the external address your data is accessible.) There are no security controls in place to prevent this, it's the default and only state.<br /><br />I can not understand how such a basic security could be ignored, the product is specifically advertised to be used with the internet. From the Amazon description of the product:<br />  &#34;Stay connected to the Internet while sharing files and photos with friends&#34;<br /><br />I contacted Kingston support and was told, &#34;Yes, we know about that issue and are not sure if we will be able to fix it in this version of the device or if it will require different hardware.&#34;
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|The book was well written and the characters were very believable.  The authors description of the views along the trail was awesome.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Engaging. Addictive. Believable and informative. Daniel Suarez has knocked it out of the park, Again. I couldn't put it down.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I absolutely love this book and the whole series! I had nothing to complain about it except for about the last 60 pages when tris flipping died! That ticked me off!
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|This book should be mandatory reading for anyone working in the mental health field.  Allie Brosh captures depression and makes it understandable to the masses.  Plus her Helper Dog is hysterically funny.  I cannot imagine anyone who would not gain something by reading this book.  Buy one for yourself and one for your therapist!  May the corn be with you...
B00005JO5L|1.0|the dvd I received wouldn't play in my player kept saying the disc was dirty.....so I played several different dvd's I had and all of them played...I wanted the movie and still want it...havn't heard anything back from anyone after sending it back....not real happy so far
0143113100|4.0|Another well-told explanation of some recent findings about the human brain.  The author relies on anecdotes mainly to make his point about brain plasticity.  He is arguing a viewpoint and is quite convincing but one must wonder whether someone with different anecdotes could make the opposite point.  Perhaps too, his repetition of cases that illustrate much the same thing is a bit excessive.  Nevertheless, this is a fascinating read and one that should be widely known.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It's a good read for sure. Can't give it five stars because it just isn't -- the pacing is out of whack at times, and the continuous reflections were slightly annoying at times since Ender wasn't particularly interesting when his thoughts were not directed at inner conflicts.<br /><br />Still, it's a quick read and was thoroughly enjoyable!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The series is slightly above average at best.  For those who complain about the ending, it did end even if you didn't like the ending. I don't particularly like the ending either but it is an ending.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excellent read. I did not expect the ending. I would recommend this book to anybody having trouble in their marriage.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book for my girl, I guess I should say ex now lol but it seem like she enjoys every bit of it. Although it did get on my nerves at times lol...great book i guesss.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was another magnificent piece by Suzanne Collins. I thought she was going to max out at the hunger games, but she managed to do it again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another &#34;King&#34; great read.  Started a bit choppy but came together in a page turner!  King novels are like an addiction - finish one and want another!  He is the master!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I do not think there is one song on this album that I do not like. I am generally not a fan of the quasi country-pop crossover stars, but I wil freely admit, that in her case and this albums case, a rare exception is made. I can't even find one song I do not like better than another.
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|This album should have been released in 2010 and Suburbs should have been released now, in 2013.  Reflektor is a groovy, dancy, moody album that would have been more suited in the late 2000s next to a release like MGMT's Oracular Spectacular.<br /><br />The title track, Reflektor, is the best song on the album.  Here Comes the Nighttime, and It's Never Over (Hey Orpheus) are my other two favorites.  Overall the record has a sweet synthetic and organic mixed sound scape.  The reggae/island mixed in with canadian punk vibes are super fresh on Flashbulb Eyes.  I like that they are experimenting.  The lyrics are mostly melancholy and have a huge sense of regret to them.  It makes for a dark introspective experience, but a highly recommended one.
B00966TN1Q|5.0|From start to finish a great book - hard to put down and I'm now sad to have finished it.<br /><br />Good plot - excellent characters and it flows so well!<br /><br />Don't miss it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it.its such an amazing game that everyone should have. My high score is right below 4 million with a 20× multiplier.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This young woman's story could change the world.  Well written, moving, and real.  Her love of country and frustration with its struggles is inspiring.  This should be required reading for teens in the US.  We esteem education far too lightly.
B00004RFCM|5.0|The season that started it all. It gave me a good laugh. Reminded of Carrie's excellent narration. What's not to love?
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|Want that mix of Tribal Wars and Age of Empires that Clash of Clans brought?<br />But do you feel like its been played out too long for you to dominate it?<br />Well Gameloft has just the game for you! Great gameplay, awesome graphics, and all in the setting of  the vast and chaotic post Roman empire! But jump in quick before someone else gets a head start, because its a vicious fight for glory, power, and bragging rights!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was huge help for me to read The Shining and Doc Sleep back to back.  The story made more sense to me.  I enjoyed this story but I thought the final battle came too fast and too easy.  Well worth reading, I hope you enjoy it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I felt as though I heard this story before.  My parents were raised in northern Ireland and were dirt poor.  I heard the tales of the orphanages, laundry,etc.<br />Aol
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative book by a cardiologist who used the approach to help many lose weight and get healthier.  I recommend everyone read it and consider their own diets.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo mail is the worst provider you could have. Match that up with a Kindle that constantly glitches out and closes apps, you will get NOWHERE. No emails read or sent, lost drafts...don't even bother. Seriously.<br /><br />Yahoo news articles are littered with grammatical errors and misspellings and the mail system is, in a word, problematic. I was locked out of my account for good for no reason. Yahoo is just the worst.
0896898288|5.0|I love the letters from the farmer's wives that accompany the blocks. The letters give me great insight into the design of the blocks and the heart of the writers for their daughter(s). As I have begun working on the blocks, I already sense a connection and understanding of the life and contribution of these amazing women to that time in our history.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun I like that's there a lot of places to play like I got the mall it's so fun the ones I like beach mall
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This series started off ok, kind of a Hunger Games rip-off but not too bad.  Unfortunately, it peaked at book one and went HORRIBLY wrong after that.  I'm really surprised someone is making a movie out of this.  I predict a box-office bomb!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I first heard about this author on Dr. Oz and I thought Wow, my suspicions about processed foods are confirmed in this doctors research. I purchased his book on kindle and it was great, easy to read and factual. I could not put it down. I have recommended it to all my friends and family who by the way thought I was a quack for switching to organic foods six years ago.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is such an amazing book Two in the series and sets up book three magnificently. You want to find out what happened to District 12. and about Peeta' s fate.  She discovers that she truly loves him in the end. There is so much action and adventure in these books that you have to read them all to do d out what happens to  Pantem, the capital and Pres.Snow. Katness loses any innocence that she had when her dad died and it was left for her to look out for her family. After surviving the Hunger Games with Peeta  as victors life has gotten better but she is more confused about her feelings for Gale and Peeta. She thought she would end up with Gale but she has too many feelings for Peeta. I think Gale is more like a brother to her since she has known him for so long. With Peeta being captured by the capital has only intensified her feelings for him and hopes that he is still alive and not tortured since he does it know anything about the rebels. This is where the book leaves you wondering  what happened and what is going on now. A great trilogy.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Really good read. I felt so sorry for the main character because of her past. Its hard to deal with that type of pain.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is the best hunting game I have ever played that is free keep it up guys halls games are awsome
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the trilogy and the movie was both entertaining, and not as gross as it could have been for young children.
B002YGSZBY|2.0|This wouln't play on my computer due to the differences in coding.  It would have been nice to have this highlighted so that I wouldn't have purchased this version as a gift.
1577314808|5.0|Life-changing! I've read this book at least three times and plan to read it again. I've referred to it often and purchased it for friends. I would recommend reading as opposed to the audio, just because it's somewhat dense. Definitely take your time with it. There are little breaks in the passages for you to stop and meditate on. I read this book two years ago, and since then, I have hardly had a bad day or even a bad moment.
1250012570|5.0|Just finished this book.  Like Eleanor who describes her feelings for Park as wanting to &#34;eat his face,&#34;  I wanted to swallow this story.  I was a little skeptical when I started because I had read &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; and loved it so much, I couldn't imagine enjoying another story where the two teenage protagonists fall in love in the face of the impossible.  Anyway, I was not disappointed.  I loved this book so much.  The characters are amazing, the plot and climax are raw and brutal, but the book maintains that the power of love is renewing without getting sappy or preachy.
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|I followed him on tv and liked his sound.  So I watched until this cd was put out so that I could have his music whenever I wanted it.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|My daughter moving  back home and working shifts for the NHS, meant that I needed a good set of 'phones  if I was to continue enjoying my music with a clear conscience. I dug out my old Beyer DT 811's which I thought sounded great when I bought them twenty-odd years ago, but times and my system have moved on and they are no longer  a satisfactory substitute for good loudspeakers- it felt like listening underwater. My current music system  is mainly middle of the road,  Sony ES 5500 amp/ 5400 SACD and Cambridge Audio Stream Magic 6 digital player, but  flattered considerably by a pair of Quad 2805 electrostatic speakers which I  just love. An odd combination perhaps but it has been developed in a logical manner and  sounds great to my ears, delivering excellent detail with a clear and uncoloured sound in it's main duty as a music system whilst  serving also  as an AV system when required. So what to match with it?<br /><br />Like other reviewers here I found it hard  to audition phones and had to rely on published sources for comparison. Difficult to interpret as opinions can be subjective, and in any case heavily dependent  on one's individual  taste in music. Amongst the many helpful  amateur reviews I found- and thanks to all who submitted them- Christopher Harris's  here  stood out for me as we appear to share similar tastes and I could relate to his description. That clinched it- decision made, and  order placed through Amazon. Great service as usual, with a delivery time given within a one hour span the following day  and arrived 10 minutes into the hour.<br /><br />Having unboxed the 702s  my first move was to try them out on my  favourite lollipops. I won't try to replicate other reviews by giving a detailed description of each piece, as others are better qualified than I to do that. But to give an idea of the territory we are in so you can gauge how relevant it is to you, some highlights are-<br /><br />Glenn Gould, Goldberg variations. The 1981 recording remastered from the backup analogue tapes, on Sony Classical. A sonic delight, if you can ignore Gould's infamous humming in the background which sounded a little more prominent through the phones than the speakers. But I found I could still blank it  out and enjoy the music.<br /><br />Andrew Manze and Richard Egarr, Handel complete violin sonatas on Harmonia Mundi. Particularly the F Major; slow bowed legato in the opening Adagio, brisk staccato in the Allegro second movement, all beautifully played and recorded and  faithfully reproduced by the cans.<br /><br />Academy of Ancient Music/ Hogwood- Beethoven's 7th symphony on L'oiseau-Lyre. Great interplay between strings and wind in the opening movement, gorgeous slow second movement with a succession of dramatic crescendos, and an energetic finale. Original instruments may  lack the power and full tone of modern ones but they do have their own charm.<br /><br />Bonnie Raitt, Dimming of the Day from Longing in their hearts. Bonnie's gin voice in reflective mood with harmony vocal from Paul Brady, against a backdrop of acoustic  guitar, organ and bass.<br /><br />Joni Mitchell, Cold blue  steel and sweet fire from the album From the Roses. Joni's haunting note-bending vocal floating high above a background of strummed guitar, with reeds wailing in the distance. Still spine tingling after 40 years.<br /><br />Allman Brothers Band, Stormy Monday from Live at the Fillmore. Laid back blues, wonderful guitar work from  Duane Allman and Dickie Betts  with great support from Thom Doucette on harmonica<br /><br />Miles Davis, So What from Kind of Blue. The opening track to the  iconic album, hesitant plucked double bass building to a steady rhythm on bass, brushed drums and piano with Davis, Coltrane and Adderley trading solo riffs. Sheer magic.<br /><br />All this was handled with aplomb by the AKGs, showing  great clarity and detail  and good separation of the various instruments. Much of the music  I played comes from oldanalogue recordings and various defects like tape hiss were revealed by the 702s , but the music shone through. A very enjoyable listening session and I was becoming convinced I was onto a winner. But I did find the bass a little light if well articulated, and  after a couple of hours listening I started to feel a mild headache. That worried me until I remembered one reviewer saying  that spectacles are incompatible with the K702s. The  ear cups fit very snugly over the ears and exert pressure on the head via the spectacle  side arms, and these also affect the seal around the ears reducing bass. Guess what I'm wearing - Doh! That seemed a good point to end the first session.<br /><br />Coming back to them fresh the following day, I thought I'd try a little experiment comparing the 702s to my old Beyers, and more importantly  to the Quad electrostatics. Without the spectacles this time. I picked out Diane Krall/ Girl in the other room on SACD, a clean modern recording with  a good range of subtle sounds,  and  plugged the phones into the SACD player. That way I could pop the cans on and mute the speakers, and go  back to the speakers again, within seconds.  I picked out several tracks for the comparison including Temptation,  vocals over a fingered double bass and brushed drums  with subtle electric guitar and piano accompaniment. I found the sound balance of the 702s was  very similar to that on the Quads,  which suggests that the 702s are pretty neutral in that respect. Bass was nicely weighted, clear but not dominant. There was a good sense of space. Detail there was aplenty with the varying weight of guitar fingering, and the hint of tremolo in some of the diminished chords, all  faithfully reproduced; it  still didn't match the Quads but then they  are a bit  special in that department.  Individual instruments were clearly distinguished and placed, and whilst  headphones couldn't be expected to match the soundstage  of  full sized speakers they came close enough. Overall,  a thoroughly engaging listen  and certainly an acceptable compromise. Switching to the Beyers was a very different story. On the positive side, the mid range was clear and warm, and in some ways preferable to the 702s with the piano in particular sounding more full and rounded.  I guess that's what attracted me to them all those years ago.  But all else was disaster. The bass was more powerful but much less articulate,  the higher frequencies dropped off sharply losing that feeling of space, and the sound stage all but vanished. The result was a boomy, muffled sound with much of the fine detail lost. Good to know that music reproduction technology hasn't stood still these past two or three decades!<br /><br />So in summary, I'm very happy with the 702s.  Whilst I haven't yet worn them for more than a couple of hours at a time, comfort seems good so long as there is no need to wear spectacles and they don't seem to fatigue the ear. If you value delicacy and detail over raw power, and don't need specs for your listening sessions  then I'm sure you'll like them.

B008H6GHL0|3.0|I can't really give a good rating on this.  But it was my fault.  I did not realize this was an digitial creation and not actual actors.  Story line was good - just surprised the ad did not clearly state not real.

B00006RAKP|5.0|When Eton 1st appeared in the mid 60's it was under his original name,Bernie Taupin, and he had already written and recorded &#34;Your Song&#34; it around 1967 playing the piano only.He later cut the song with more musical instruments and it was a hit and very great song to lsten to.Ellton has had many hit  recorderds and #1 songs from then to date and keeps rolling the crowds in to his concerts where he has on outfits that are dazzling to the eye,like I wouldn't be caught dead in that oufit!To him he likes the different touch like the huge platfor shoes and sunglasses in &#34;Tommie&#34; starring &#34;The Who&#34; who gave their all for that movie with Eltons appearance of the great #1 song &#34;Pinball Wizard&#34;.I have abiut every song I guess he ever cut and still love to listen to the man sing..INCREDIBLE is all I can say he is!!

B00AF6MF9I|3.0|I've been play this game for a few days now and must have spent 50$ worth in dlc.<br />Great game and all but I have found that the game does not save everything you do/build. I level up and unlock the airfield, place it, unlock another portion of the map and come back to find I have no airfield and no expansion anymore. Not the first time happening. When this issue is fixed, I'll give 4 stars.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I may not love some of the story lines from this show, but I love the music they bring into my home.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The writer brought us into the very depths of human frailty.  Each character drew you into their suffering and strength that comes with perseverance.  So well written, this author has the gift of words to be enjoyed  by all who read her.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Been waiting for this to come out so I can complete all the unlockables on the console version. If you have injustice on the console you need this app to unlock some of the coolest costumes for it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read.  I read this immediately after reading A Time to Kill and truly enjoyed that some of the characters stayed true to form.  I believe that this is Grisham's second greatest work (behind A Time to Kill).
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I was glued to the chapters wanting to know what came next. Although completely different from The Book Thief, this one kept me going straight through to the end just like it. Amazing messages about living life! Thanks!
B004XWMXX8|5.0|This CD is a great new look at the classic Selena Gomez. Not only does Miss Gomez show us her old, sweet, and unique personality that we all have loved since she just started appearing on television, she also breaks into an audience older than tweens and teens. Selena's CD is very impressive! Her songs have taken the next step and evolved into a more adult tune. Her lyrics and melodies bring out her firing passion in every song that someone who listens to even just a little bit of one knows she takes her work seriously. Her songs give powerful meanings and her music videos for them keep getting better and better. Check out Miss Gomez and The Scene's delectable music. And if you haven't already, check out their new CD, &#34;Stars Dance&#34;. It contains Selena's new hit single, &#34;Slow Down&#34; and is just as good, if not better, than &#34;When the Sun Goes Down&#34;.

B008IGP8QE|5.0|This Album ROCKS! Ross Lynch and his friends on &#34;Austin and Ally&#34; have created the best first album to the hit show. I love the beat of every song -- it is perfect to rock out to with friends. It's hip, it's clean, and anyone who watches Disney Channel or likes music that comes from Disney Channel will love this. This soundtrack has all of the hit songs from the show and even a couple of bonus songs from Ross's family band, R5. From part of a hometown band to a Disney celebrity, Ross Lynch has showed his fans his capability to create rocking music. This Disney hit is a blast for any occasion, whether just listening to it in the car on your way to school or as a playlist for a rocking party! This is one of the best Disney albums out there for tweens and would make a perfect present for those youngsters during the upcoming holidays. Check this out! You won't regret it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of those shows where you need to see the next episode. The show is very well done and realistic.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|This is not as good as &#34;The Citizens of London&#34;.  I thought it was brilliant.  It did not paint the US in a good light, and that was a different picture to me.  This book is about the same time in the US.  What a difficult time that was.  I was a child during that war, and all I remember is the tremendous war effort.What a relvelation to read how hard Roosevelt had to work to get us into war.
B0039208JE|5.0|A lot of people say the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve Superman film started off big budget Superhero films but if they started it the 1987 disaster that was Superman IV: The Quest for Peace almost killed it. THIS FILM in my opinion is what started off the modern Superhero era.<br />The film holds a soft spot in my heart because I still remember seeing it in theaters when I was 6 years old. This is also the first time Batman is portrayed in a major motion picture without the campiness and cornball humor of the Adam West Batman. This movie is responsible for helping the mainstream public learn that Batman is far from a joke and is one of the greatest badasses in American Pop Culture.<br />Jack Nicholson is amazing as the Joker and I'm sure everyone knows that but Michael Keaton really is great as Bruce Wayne/Batman. I know a lot of people complained because he didn't physically look the part but his performance is perfect. He's also the first person to speak with a slightly altered voice when wearing the Bat suit, even though a lot of people will try to claim Kevin Conroy who voices Batman in the awesome animated series did it first they are wrong. This film came out in 1989 and the Animated Series came out in 92. Keaton did it first.<br />The Batmobile in this film is arguably the most badass version of the Batmobile you'll find in any form of Batman media whether its other films, comics or cartoons. This film greatly inspired the 1992 Animated Series with it's design and you can clearly see that. This is also BY FAR the best of the Burton/Schumacher Batman films. After this one they got progressively worse to the point that Batman & Robin is damn near unwatchable.<br />Is this the greatest Batman film of all time? No way. Is this better than Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy? Not at all. Is this a fun, entertaining and exciting action/superhero film? ABSOLUTELY. The soundtrack is a bit dated and total 80's with Prince songs but I honestly think it helps add to the charm of the movie. The Danny Elfman score is ICONIC and right up there with John Williams Superman, Star Wars and Indiana Jones themes. It's shocking and mind boggling why they changed his score for Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.<br />The only SLIGHT negative I'll say about this film is that THIS particular version of Batman kills without remorse. If you can take that with a grain of salt then you'll have no problem enjoying this film for what it is. A fun, entertaining action adventure film that helped usher in all of the modern Superhero films that fill movie theaters to this day.add to the charm of the movie.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is &#34;old&#34; John Grisham writing.  It's not as good as his very first books, but it is almost that good.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Awesome movie. It gets a lot of flak because it had the tough task of following up The Dark Knight and Heath Ledger's legendary performance as the Joker but this movie is a classic that will grow on people over time and stands on it's own two feet. It's really a first for Superhero films since it gives a definitive ending for THIS version of Batman which some fans may not have liked.<br />Christian Bale is outstanding as usual but Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy both kill it as Catwoman and Bane. Hardy is the first Batman film villain to ever be a true equal to Batman in terms of physicality and mental skill. I know some people complained about being able to understand what Hardy was saying but I had no problem and I think if you just LISTEN and have the volume properly set you'll have no problem either. Hathaway IS Catwoman, hot as Hell and extremely tough and believably bad ass at the right moments. When she rides the Batpod there's no doubt that she got in insanely great shape for this role. You'll know what I mean when you see her mount it. If you're a fan of Batman or superhero films then this cannot be recommended enough.<br />This is more than just a good &#34;superhero&#34; film, its just a great FILM. Beautifully shot, amazing score, some really great effects like the Football Stadium scene and the opening on the Airplane, and arguably the best fight scenes of The Dark Knight Trilogy, especially the first fight between Batman and Bane underneath Gotham City.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|As this is a #1 game by many, this is not my favorite. In order to win you have to buy boosters. Easy to spend too much money.  Very addictive.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of Horror in general. A lot of people think this is a remake of the first Evil Dead and they're right to a certain extent but not entirely. If you watch the commentary or do your research you'll learn that they had problems with getting footage from the original film so basically the first 10 or so minutes of Evil Dead 2 are a sort of recap of the original Evil Dead where they trim things down to just Ash and Linda.<br />*SPOILERS* The end of The Evil Dead features the unseen Demonic force sneaking up on Ash and knocking him through the woods. So in Evil Dead 2 when the invisible force knocks Ash through the woods and he wakes up in the mud puddle possessed only to have the demon forced out by the sun that is actually where Evil Dead 1 ends and Evil Dead 2 TRULY begins *END SPOILERS*<br />This film is a horror classic and the Blu-Ray is full of great features and the film itself has never looked or sounded better. And with the low price even if you own a dozen version of this film there's really no reason for you not to pick this up, especially if you're a fan of the films or just horror in general.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Great fun! &#34;Three  Amigos&#34; style movie where misguided aliens seek aid from washed up TV actors. Watched this many times. Always good when I want a laugh. Usually &#34;over the top&#34; nicely balanced by Tony Shaloub character.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|This is a great B movie from the 80's. Fun, doesn't take itself too seriously, and has great make up and effects for the Killer Klowns. Do not go into this expecting some riveting, critical, influential film. This is simple B movie fun at it's finest. If you enjoy horror movies of the 80's and are just looking for something quick and fun to watch sometime then this is perfect for you.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great movie. Action packed thriller from start to finish. Daniel Craig continues the 007 tradition. Can't wait for next film.
B003TT2X72|5.0|This second film in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is full of many badass moments. The end fight scene is amazing. The build up to it and the actual pay off of the fight will not leave you disappointed. &#34;Epic&#34; is a far too overused word in today's society but the Battle of Helm's Deep truly is EPIC.<br />Viggo Mortensen kills it as Aragorn and he has to since this film is largely on his shoulders where the first movie was more on Frodo, Gandalf and the Hobbits. Mortensen just seems like a guy that you would want to follow and can range from sympathetic to straight up badass. The film is pretty much split into three tales. Frodo and Sam transporting the ring, Legolgas Aragorn and Gimli helping out Rohan, and Merry and Pippen with the Giant Trees which really may feel like the film is dragging when it switches to them but it really helps build to the ultimate pay off at the end battle.<br />The special effects and score in this movie, just like the rest of the series are amazing. The pace really picks up in this film and the stakes get raised for the final battle set to come in Return of the King.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This was an enjoyable read!  I had no idea anyone in the world had to live like that....if they really do
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie blows Superman Returns away and is the first worthy Superman movie since the original with Christopher Reeve. I know a lot of people were on the fence about the amount of action and violence in this movie but this film has a HIGHLY realistic tone. If you want a campy, fun loving, almost cartoonish take on what an alien invasion in a major city would be like then The Avengers is for you. The climax of this film is basically what would happen if a large alien force invaded a city and there was only ONE super powered being present to fight off the attack in a realistic way. There are real consequences to the battles in this film. The action is over the top and looks amazing.<br />The music in this film is amazing as well. I honestly didn't think the John Williams score could ever be topped but that music was for Christopher Reeve and the music in this film is PERFECT. When the main score kicks in at the end of the film if you're a true Superman fan you'll get Goosebumps and it will make you anticipate the sequel even more.<br />All of the performances in this movie are amazing. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe are amazing as Superman's Earth and Krypton father respectively. Henry Cavill IS Superman. This guy isn't just doing his best Christopher Reeve impersonation. He takes the role and makes it his own. He is jacked beyond belief and just looks like he could tear a city apart with his bare hands. There are times where he's standing there in the Superman costume not even speaking and you just KNOW that this guy IS Superman.<br />The special features are very, very good and loaded with entertaining and interesting stuff. If you're a fan of Superman or just superhero films in general then this is a must have. If you love action and want a more realistic approach to superhero films then this is right up your alley and will not disappoint.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this series due to curiosity...but I was addicted immediately and HAD to purchase the next one as soon as I finished each book.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|If you enjoy The Walking Dead, horror films, zombies or just slow moving zombies in general then this is a MUST OWN for you. George Romero makes one of the all time greatest horror movies and defines what a zombie film should be with this movie. If you even think about watching the 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead before watching this then you are really missing out and doing yourself an injustice.<br />Some of the special effects may seem dated or not up to par when you consider today's films and even the television show The Walking Dead, but the story of exactly what happens to society when the world ends and the dead rise is the main draw here. The main difference between this film and the 2004 remake is EVERYONE returns from the dead. If you get bit by a zombie you turn, but if you just die in general you turn. That means anyone who dies in their sleep, commits suicide without destroying the brain, has a heart attack, a brain aneurysm, etc will return from the grave. The sheer amount of undead you would face would be unbelievable and that, in my opinion, is far scarier than undead that can sprint like marathon runners and make noises that resemble Raptor's from Jurassic Park.<br />If you're looking for a great, old school, classic horror film that will make you think then check this out. You will not be disappointed. There would be no &#34;Walking Dead&#34; and no zombie genre without this film and George Romero. Do yourself a favor and watch this classic.

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I finally read the first book of the Harry Hole series. Now some things are clear that are referred to in later books. I should have read this book first but glad I finally got around to it.<br /><br />It's not my favorite Harry Hole book but it is really good. As always, the ending was unexpected. Nice job Jo! Please keep the story going.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Excellent and incredibly informative. Another Bryson masterpiece. I've read virtually every book Bryson has written. This book was filled with so much information about who was doing what in the early 20th century. Bill's writing style is just great.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|My favorite Harry Hole story so far. So much detail in the back story. Loved how Jo ties the past and present together and how this book is the foundation for future Harry Hole stories.
1438826486|5.0|This is a well-made calendar, and my seven year old son loves it. I think his only disappointment is  that none of the &#34;mods&#34; he's into are not represented, but what does he expect? Those are not sanctioned by the company, so whatever... you get what you get. Anyway, it would make great holiday gift for anyone that loves Minecraft.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Where do I begin?  This was a book I'd seen over and over and thought well, I guess I'll try it today!  There are themes throughout.  For adults, for kids, for parents, for friends, for family, everyone really.  August Pullman is truly a wonder! I fell in love with Auggie-doggie!  :)
1451666179|5.0|This book is completely amazing. It has made me laugh outloud so many times and it is just so true to life. If you like dry humor and can laugh at lifes oddities, you will likely love this book.
1781162646|4.0|It is a good book. Shorter than most King books, reads quickly.  A bit more mystery than horror, but a great read by a master writer.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A wonderfully written addition to the game of thrones anthology. A Dance of Dragons was not merely authored as it was masterfully crafted. The complex characters and opposing factions, along with the Thomas Hobbes like portrayal of stark realities of a medieval world infested with violence and treachery. Truly an addictive read. This was the 2nd time that I have taken the journey into the game of thrones series. Hopefully I (along with many fellow enthusiasts) will be able to walk with George R.R. Martin's characters in his final culminating work: \\"The Winds of Winter\\".
B003VS0CXS|4.0|This is a gift for a fan of the movie. Disc works. Nothing to add to that.This is the one time I could have gotten it cheaper elsewhere.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I can't say enough about clean sweep. Kindle free time was taking up a ton of unnecessary space and clean sweep found it and eliminated it!
0553801473|5.0|Not as great as the first 2 or 3 by Martin, but a great book in a great series of books.  Martin lives up to his reputation of always keeping you guessing by putting his character through situations that change their lives.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt knows how to spin a story--a long one, 800 pages.  The trade-off is that you don't want The Goldfinch to end. That Charles Dickens is Tartt's  favorite author is evident in the characters who people her novel, such as the orphan and the artful dodger and the benevolent caretaker. As with Dickens' works, there are elements of humor, supplied in spades by the narrator's friend Boris. The dialogue crackles.  The prose flows-- with one exception:  the narrator's habit of overusing the word &#34;amidst,&#34; which--since this is a contemporary setting-- strikes this reader as being anachronistic.  But the plot is intriguing enough and the characters complex enough so that one might be inclined to overlook that. It took the author eleven years to write this book, plenty of time to get the plot just right.  She knows where she's going, but she keeps the reader guessing.  The Goldfinch is for people who love to read.  The Goldfinch is an Amazon Best Book of the Year.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this mouse! I watched it for sale for a couple weeks before I pulled the trigger.<br /><br />It has all the power of a high end gaming mouse, but at a reasonable price.<br /><br />The ability to change the weight of the mouse and the DPI settings is great! I can go from flying a plane to sniping and then to assault in Battlefield 4 and change my sensitivity on the mouse in no time (1 button push!). If were them I'd change the thumb cushion to something that doesn't quite collect so much grime, but its nothing a cotton ball of alcohol won't clean.
B00DZPVS9O|5.0|I have been a Monster Magnet fan ever since Superjudge came out. My favorite bands have always been English, but USA's Monster Magnet are right up there with them! I wanted to live with this new release for a few weeks so that I could give a more seasoned view. When I first heard it, I immediately thought it was one of their best. Now I think it is absolutely the best album they have released. All of the various Monster Magnet styles from over the years, are on this album, and are perfected. It is like a fine wine that has reached it's point of perfection! I particularly love the Hawkwind influences on a few tracks. I would hate to say, 'every one a gem', but close enough for rock & roll, maaan!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How can you NOT love this show? Its Joss Whedon directing a show about a spaceship crew!<br /><br />I was sad to see it go and even sadder to learn it was officially dead with no hope of returning.<br /><br />At least I will always have my season on DVD from Amazon.

B00006L9ZT|5.0|There are any number of other complete Rings one could recommend on audio.  Not that this one is terrible, it is not.  The Alberich, Mime, and Hunding are exceptional and would rate with any performer of the past.  And the other cast members are all more than adequate.  But for a traditional staging on video, this is not merely the BEST version, it is the ONLY version out there.  It's the closest by far to what the composer would have expected.  And the conducting is particularly excellent.<br /><br />I would like to bring up the frequently mentioned topic of tempo.  Other reviewers have asserted that Levine's tempi are too slow.  Out of the whole Ring cycle I noticed very few places that were markedly slower than other mainstream recordings.  One example offhand would be the entrance of the giants in Rheingold.  Even there the tempo seemed musically and dramatically correct to me.  On the other hand, Levine was a bit brisk elsewhere.  The entire Wintersturm scene (to end of Walkure Act I) was almost too fast to recognize.  Compare to the benchmark Bruno Walter 1933 recording with Melchior (I don't mean compare voices, just compare tempo).  Where are these slow tempos?<br /><br />Minor quibbles aside, I have loved this performance since taping it from PBS in 1990.  Very happy to have replaced those worn-out tapes with new DVDs :)  Sure, I enjoy Solti, Bohm, and Furtwangler audio, but would not want any but a traditional production on video.  I sure hope someone else will also do one sometime!

B003VANOFY|5.0|This is the best headset I have had.  I had some Triton's that broke after about 6 months because of the plastic.  These are very well built and have no sign of problems.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|When I got this game I was exited.It seemed really fun.At first it was okay.Then after a while it got really boring and repetitive.I deleted it.
1455525839|1.0|I read a lot of violent books and can accept inhumanity to man but cannot abide killing animals within the framework of a novel. There is no excuse for killing a dog. I often resolve that I will stop listening/reading a book where an animal meets a gratuitous death, but am usually too wrapped up in the plot to quit outright. So I forgive, and move on. After all, no real dogs died in the preparation of this manuscript.<br />But when they killed the second dog*  I shut it down, turned off the tape and erased it from my phone. I will not read another Pendergast again, ever. You shouldn't either, if animal cruelty, even fictional, upsets you.<br />*This isn't a spoiler, the killing of the dogs is a minor occurrence that has little bearing on the plot. I don't know if that should make us feel better or worse, but these deaths are hurtful because the animals are innocent, any way you add it up.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I got this game and it was really fun.At first.Then it got really,really slow.If it hadn't I would have given it a 5 star.I was disappointed.
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is pretty fun. I like that you can get more free puzzles. The carasel is difficult to use though.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great game very fun. Fun to do when you have idle time on your hands. I like seeing the trucks go to each place.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Earth Wind & Fire has been one of my most favorite musical groups.  They have that special sound that only they can produce.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I can't decide whether I truly enjoy this book or not, I feel the entire series really will rest on the power of the next book. The feel and flow is like a welcome friend but some of the decisions made by the characters make for sour taste in the mouth and almost put you out of the moment. But with that said when I stop and think about the long term implications of their actions and what they've been through and the society around them I get a better understanding of what the author is trying to strive for. I look forward to the next book since this is very much a story that should be read without waiting between sets.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Holy.. I read this in one day. This book was slow at first but then it sped up real fast when the games started. I wish there was more of the games
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed the game. it was long, but did not drag on. the graphics are great and the puzzlesmake sense. worth the money.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game! The graphics are amazing. Fairly challenging as well. Definitely worth the price as it will take you a good few hours to finish.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is the only way I can look at Netflix on my bedroom television, very convenient.  Does a big job for such a small device
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this type of puzzle game.  I couldn't quit playing until I beat it!  I can't wait for more levels!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I never watched the beginning season's & have been told by several friends how good the show is.  I wanted to watch from the beginning & now I can (at my leisure).
B009H442DG|2.0|Wow, this is not the Grease glory days.  Olivia can still pull her weight, but John is absolutely horrible.  The production sounds like a high school project.  I'm a big fan but not even I can condone this atrocity.  Olivia must have signed this contract after a little too much egg nog.  They'll sell a ton just because, but this is not good music at all.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Oh come on... who can hate Hugo!!  A story that has been redone several times, even a stage play.  Read the English version, but only if you can't do the original French.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|If you ever wondered, &#34;Is there life after death?&#34; then you must read Anita's story. It is inspirational and teaches us a lot about the purpose of life, what happens when we die, and about spontaneous healing. This book is a “must read” if you consider yourself even remotely spiritual. I highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read over a thousand books and this was one of my favorites. This was an amazing book and I can imagine it would make a blockbuster movie. I have never written a review before but Hugh Howey has a hit that will be thoroughly enjoyed by everyone who loves a great book!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I wouldn't say that it's perf..but it's almost. Could toats use work tho, most deff<br />But when my niece's come over they toats adore it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is an amazing mouse for the price of $39.99! I'll break this review down in to sections, I guess.<br /><br />Size/Shape/Asthetics:<br />Very ergonomic design, fits easily in my hand. Very comfortable for long sessions, too! I've played 4+ hours of games at a time, and my hand has never hurt from holding this mouse. It's quite big in my opinion, but it still fits quite nicely in your hand.<br /><br />LEDs:<br />Very nice lighting on this mouse. One on the Anker symbol, which you can change the color of in the included software (I keep it blue to match the color scheme of the mouse), 4 LEDs for the DPI, and one LED on the scroll wheel. All in all, very eye pleasing, not too bright.<br /><br />Buttons:<br />9 buttons! That's crazy! Great for macros, volume up/down etc. on the fly, like when you're in a game.<br />My bindings are:<br />3 thumb buttons - Vol up, vol down, mute<br />Front middle button (big one in front) - alt-tab<br />Medium middle button - control-alt-delete<br />Small middle button - DPI switch<br /><br />Weights:<br />I put all the weights in, though I don't feel much of a difference... I don't know, maybe some people do, but I don't.<br /><br />Software:<br />The software that comes on the CD with the mouse is super easy to use and very helpful to create macros, change your bindings, your DPI and more.<br /><br />Overall I think Anker did an amazing job, and I love this mouse. The DPI is crazy for the price and very helpful, since I play a lot of FPS games like Counter-Strike. Great job Anker, I couldn't have asked for more.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Download it now two thumbs .. WiFi multiple player works great when friends around ..  join the gamer circle look me up ...if you think your good let's see ..ILL kick your @$&sect;&quot;&quot;..enjoy
B00G32QIEG|2.0|Great actors...poor eveything else.<br />What a great idea and what happened to it?<br />1st grader script, non imaginative characters...<br />Staying frosty???<br />yes...and far, far away too...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My grown daughter played this for quite a while before I tried it!I didn't know what all the hoopla was all about til then. OMG, I am hooked and since I do not Facebook, I am doing it without extra lives!  Lots of fun!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This show is awesome, I have watched a ton of Sci-Fi in my day and this one is among the best I have ever seen. I very rarely hand out 5 star rating's. Thank you to the makers of this great TV show, I hope it never ends.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|Nice packaging.  Included the Mini-series and the Razor movie.  Nice small booklet included covering each major character of the series.  Liked the blu-ray extras and BD-Live features it supported.  The first disc played w/o issue on my U.S.A. blu-ray player.
1250038820|5.0|Absolutely true to the blog and facebook page.<br />It's inspiring and visually stunning!<br />i just hope there were more stories like on Facebook.
B005SAP45I|5.0|Pixar just keeps putting out good family programming. An interesting take on what happens when you take a small town boy out into the bigger world.  Good opportunity for Mater to shine.
0316055433|5.0|I loved this book! I've read her two other books, and while I loved A Secret HIstory, I didn't quite enjoy A LIttle Friend as much. This, however, is her best yet! I highly recommend this. I couldn't put it down, and it was so intelligently written. I was sad when it ended!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Great movie with a compelling story.  What happens when operations go bad?  How does an aging agnet handle a young man's game?  Certainly an update in the type of threat which faces the indomitable Bond.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Needs a lot of attention to really get growing unless you buy crowns.  Keep this in mind when you start.
B006O2QNOU|1.0|I am sure that the story would have been interesting.  I have been looking for a taunt mental thriller.  Unfortunately, the excessive language in even the opening scenes really spoiled the movie for me.  I realize that won't affect everyone the same way, but if you don't enjoy listening to foul language, it does get in the way of enjoying the story.  This might work well with a TV Guardian or Clearplay filtering mechanism which allows one to watch the story without having to listen to the language.  The only drawback is if the language is so pervasive that the filtering devices crater the storyline connections.  I did not finish more than about five to ten minutes.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This Is the best game I ever played in my life I will play this game until I die and then when I die I will still be playing it
B000VIK8D0|2.0|This is another case of where the movie was impacted by the excessive language.  This fact will not ruin the movie for everyone, but if one does not enjoy listening to bad language it totally takes away from the story.  I did not finish this.  Watched maybe 20 minutes.
B00CWXIL54|5.0|Finally, this great unknown classic is available again on vinyl for those of us that missed it when released. Sounds great!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series! I love the characters and the drama that follows them. It is very easy to caught up in the story and hard to stop reading it.
0062238868|4.0|This is a great read for those of us who are fascinated by warfare.  Mr. Kyle doesn't go into great detail about his tactics, which I assumed was so he wouldn't reveal SEAL secrets, but it was fascinating nonetheless.  At times he seemed slightly arrogant, but I overlooked that b/c he was simply reporting his successes, and I think it's in our nature to think someone is tooting their own horn if they point out something they're good at.  It's sad that he met his demise while helping a fellow vet, and I think reading this was a nice opportunity to see what Mr. Kyle was about.  Seemed like a great guy who did what he did for this country and simply told his story in a patriotic manner.  He talks about killing quite a bit, which could be unpleasant for the soft hearted out there.  It was enjoyable, but it's not for everyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addictive I can not stand it.  But I can't stop it. I just keep going. Please help. :)  ,
B00GXFR21Q|5.0|Got a chance to watch this before it was released, and I must say it is amazing.  There are so many different stories in this film that I can guarantee you'll learn something you never knew about the awesome history behind music that has been loved for decades.  Definitely gonna buy a copy when it's released.
B005LAII12|1.0|I am such a big Seth M. fan, and a major fan of Family Guy.<br />The previews of this were great, but the movie was so bad, in oh so many ways.<br />Did they even wright a script or was it all adlib?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The game is very entertaining. The only thing I have found to be a problem is not being able to access Facebook friends who are. I know some have accepted my request but I haven't been able to access their kingdoms. I also wish the time for making things wasn't so long and that there was another way of making money. All in all though prefer this version to the Facebook version.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|I just love Olivia newton john and Travolta.<br />Excellent movie, brings good old memories,<br />Love the music and dancing how clean and innocent it is.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this trilogy and all the characters in it! I'm so sad to end it. I can't wait to see how the movie turns out
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This app is fun. There are hard challenges where you have to think but it's fun.<br />Hope you guys get this app. It is fun.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|Awesome review tacos pickles and Facebook Ma and forgiving the Teenage Witch hunt and grief but I don't know what Honduras
B008SLEX1U|5.0|My daughter (2.5 yrs) loves &#34;spooky&#34; books, so when Halloween was over and I had to put away her illustrated copy of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, I knew that she would love A Christmas Carol.  The spirit of the story is not lost, although this book has been adapted for young children and the ghosts are really not that spooky.  The illustrations are beautiful and we are happy to have this as part of our holiday traditions.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game ever, it has a little bit of everything in it, action, comedy, it test's your reflexes, I tend to get bored with games really fast but not with this game.
1449410243|5.0|OMG!! This book is hilarious!!! A must have for any cat owner, cat lover, or just if you like funny cat pictures on the internet. It also comes with a poster that we hung on our wall of various ways your cat is plotting to kill you. A definite must buy so you can read again and again!
B0002WZTOI|5.0|A great movie it shows the true meaning of love and great friendship of these brothers in arms! I was in the military also when I was17 and I served for 3years I have a good friend which I served with we have been friends for more than 30years.Brothers in Arms, I Love him as my own Brother.Pablo Vazquez Sydney Australia
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is horrible.  The interface is like one of those old cellphones and not a smartphone and it make it worst when viewing it in the beautiful Kindle Fire HDX screen.  Amazon you have a Kindle native Facebook app and not use this crap from Android market for phones.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting. I play it almost every day. I love how they keep coming up with more updates. I also love that it is free and every one can play it.:)
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book Is so cute and happy! I cried and laughed and it was awesome! I recommend this to anyone that needs a heart-touching read!
1476712042|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I finished this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. Jamie McGuire did an excellent job writing this book. This is a must read! I never got bored with this book. I love Travis and Abby. Everything that happens in this book is perfect. This is one of those books where you get pulled into the story emotionally. You feel what Abby and Travis are feeling. I smiled so much through this book but i also got emotional with the characters. Beautiful Disaster is by far my favorite book. Please please please read this book and the follow up book Walking Disaster! AMAZING
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Great graphics like most GLU games. However, like most GLU games, the further you go, the more it locks up or closes out. Due to that I am only givingit 3 stars.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|One I wanted. Could not find this movie. Looked for it for awhile.<br />I am happy to find movies I like an want.

1451666179|4.0|This woman is definitely &#34;half a bubble off of plumb&#34; but she knows it and lets us enjoy her personal brand of wackiness in an entertaining book about her trials and tribulations with her dogs and the world at large. Many illustrations but she has to be the worst artist I have seen presented in a book but somehow the expressions she is trying to portray manage to shine through. Second book by a woman of her generation I have read this year and like the first author, she also suffers from &#34;potty mouth&#34;. Not sure what the appeal of that is to the younger folks but if you can get through that it is a funny and enjoyable read.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Colin Firth is a masterful actor as we know, but I believe this to be his finest role.<br />This is a beautifully filmed heartfelt movie-<br />it is remarkable that Tom Ford ventured outside of his usual realm with this jewel<br />one of my favorite all time movies
3899554914|1.0|Vertical twins or inline fours with pod filters or velocity stacks and no rear fender? Firestone 5.00 x 16&#34; tire on the front of a Bonneville?<br /><br />How many of these do you have to build before realizing: That doesn't work.<br /><br />There are a few decent bikes in this book, but just a few.

067144901X|5.0|This book is an instant favorite with my twin boys!  They love the simple words and animal sounds.  I love the subtle humor - three pigs singing, &#34;la la la&#34; - so silly and fun to impersonate!
B000OPOAJS|5.0|I was browsing around for holiday shopping and saw I purchased this back in 2010 but never reviewed it. If you have never seen this movie, you've probably heard about the car chase. It's spectacular! So is the action, and so are the performances from a very solid cast of actors. This is an action/thriller that most guys should have in their collection, so it's a great buy or a great gift. It's also good enough that it's date-movie friendly for a night in.<br /><br />Every movie with an action scene tries to hype their action - this movie has the action that got others to hype it.

0393317552|4.0|People have been recommending this book to me for at least a dozen years.  I am happy to have at last gotten around to it.  Professor Diamond basically says, to vastly oversimplify things, that geography is destiny.  Some societies succeed and others don’t primarily because of their location.  If our ancestors were in an area where there were plants and animals suitable for domestication, they had a head start, because food production made people available for specialized tasks, which ultimately led to a stratified, organized society capable of carrying out larger projects.  This makes sense to me.  The Americas, Africa, and Australia did not have enough animals suitable for domestication, and the few suitable plants were, for the most part, inferior to those of Eurasia.  Thus, Eurasians came to dominate the earth, rather than Africans, Native Americans, or New Guineans.  Diamond stresses that this dominance came not from innate superior strength and intelligence, but rather from their advantageous geography.  This was his reason for writing the book.<br /><br />I appreciated the way that Diamond approached his material from multiple disciplines.  He supports his arguments with archaeological evidence, genetic testing, paleolinguistics, climatology, et cetera.  This kind of scholarship was very impressive in his examination of the migrations of peoples.<br /><br />The only part of his argument I didn’t really buy was his idea of “continental axes.”  According to Diamond, Eurasia has a natural east-west axis, which allows the rapid diffusion of crops and innovations.  The Americas and Africa, on the other hand, have north-south axes.  To my way of thinking, there are too many exceptions for this to be completely accurate.  One thing that puzzled me was why Diamond never examined the idea that if Polynesians were capable of travelling in rafts and canoes from Indonesia to Hawaii, why couldn’t the Indians of the Pacific Northwest, who were adept whalers, travel by boat to Tierra del Fuego, if they wanted to?  Was the so-called “bottleneck” of Panama really that great an obstacle?<br /><br />Before reading any work of history it’s good to remember what Orwell said: “He who controls the past, controls the future.”  Virtually all history writers have an agenda.  Diamond states his up front.  He also rather disturbingly hints in a couple of places that some people could interpret one’s disagreement with him as an act of racism.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and found it very stimulating and provocative reading that asks big questions and tries to answer them.el by boat to Tierra del Fuego, if they wanted to?

B006INDGFE|1.0|Oh, so very nasty and not in a good way.  Yuck.  Surely not even brain-dead, drug-addled teenage frat boys found this one amusing in the least.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Pretty addictive game. At times it feels almost impossible to get enough money for equipment needed. Finally on level 4. Hoping for more levels soon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun if you love horses :)<br /> I would love to have a real horse to spend time with and ride but this is cool in the meantime hehe
B003KGBISY|5.0|This is typical Criterion Collection - excellent packaging and extras. It was kind of weird to watch this Japanese classic on a remastered blu-ray after growing up seeing it in moderately low quality and on old fashioned tube TVs. It was almost jarring on a modern LED HDTV.<br /><br />HOWEVER - it was a great experience and if you're a fan of this movie or have only ever seen the Magnificent Seven, I would definitely say that this is a movie and an excellent edition to purchase.<br /><br />The blu-ray does have the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio (more of a rectangle than 4:3 tv's, but not as wide as modern HDTVs). Also included are a very nice book with a variety of information, notes, and MIFUNE &#34;in his own words,&#34; etc., plus a second disc of extras.
B00DBSZ6ZC|1.0|terrible movie, awful plot & sad special effects. Not sure why I even bothered but to see Jeremy Renner in tight leather outfits ... Not sure if that was worth the price of the rental ...
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This is a gentle read of self-discovery told in a contrived manner, with some very funny insights and comments on love and sex in the modern age.  Our protagonist's seemingly extreme self-awareness and complete social dysfunction blend into a commentary on how little we know ourselves.  The story unfolds in ways to let the reader understand more about what is really happening than what our narrator does.  A book that had to be difficult to write but a pleasure to read.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|I was really ready to not like this new version of Superman, honest.  But I must say I enjoyed it.  I liked the backstory very much (hell, I'd watch Russell Crowe brush his teeth) and  &#34;Clark's&#34; childhood were entertaining and enlightening.  Henry Cavill is just a bit too averagely-good-looking for my taste, but he carried it off nicely.  (missed the little forelock curl however!)  I liked the relationships, especially with Clark's adopted father (Kevin Costner, who just keeps getting better).  I was gratified that Lois wasn't just a ditzy dame.  It was the final fight scene(s) that fatigued me a bit; while expertly done and amazing, it was too much, too long and finally unbelievable.  Just see it and enjoy a franchise being re-awakened.
B000053VAF|4.0|Some extra features would not play but so happy to watch since not available on Netflix. I will love the movie as long as I can somewhat see the picture BUT hear the dialogue clearly. :)

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Have spent a good hour trying to connect device to a new wifi connection with no luck. Gave up. Must use Chrome which is fine but setup and interface was very spotty on Macbook pro.
0811879542|5.0|My grandchildren love this book!  The 10 year old read it twice - and then went back to her 10 year old books.  The 5 year old read it 10 times and did every activity on each page every time.  The 3 year old had it read to her 10 times and never got tired of pressing here and shaking there, etc.  And that was just the for weekend visit!  I recommend this for ages 2-6.

Always a follow up email to make sure your happy, great packaging, and stylish products! What more could you ask for!!
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Never received download, although I paid $4.99 for it. Not really sure if available on Kindle Fire 1. Very Disappointed!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|As other reviews have mentioned, the goal is a bit disturbing but it is a fun game. I love strategy games so I had to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I usually name my plagues things like &quot;happiness&quot; or &quot;giggles&quot; so it makes the actual goal less creepy, plus it's hilarious to see &quot;giggles has destroyed humanity&quot;. If you like strategy games, this is well worth the money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just hard enough to keep you jumping. I would recommend this game to everyone! MobiGrow makes wonderful games. I will buy more.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Would not work on my kindle. Mad at Amazon. Works on my other ipad. I don't understand hope it works on my new kindle coming in Dec.
0761119752|5.0|I love this little book, my little granddaughter loves to dance-sortof to music (at 16 months) and this little book is just the right mix of calming and rhythm to be a nice read (a couple of times) to start to calm down before the final trip into bed. Okay, maybe it's just MY favorite to read aloud but that counts too.

0060794410|5.0|I have not listened to this audio book yet, but I will.  It is much easier to listen and drive, than to read and drive.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I could not get through this book for the life of me. Its boring, and slow. Most of Nicholas Sparks books are slow but start to become interesting towards the middle. Not this book. I have not finished it, nor do I have any desire too. Save your money on this one. I can only imagine the movie is just as bad.
B00EB9Z9Z2|3.0|Nice people success story. But I still prefer the Secret, the book and the video. Interesting to know how this book hero became Hero
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|I was not aware we were given a free rental until after the rental expired, otherwise I would have loaded it to my kindle fire.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|A lot of people continue reading a book for the relationships and that was destroyed in this book. She had a lot of options with this book and I believe she chose the wrong one and then poorly executed it.
B008ZDC7M8|2.0|Within 5 minutes he buries Casablanca and spends most of the series trivializing Hollywood's contribution to film. I appreciate the focus on world cinema, and the work that went into this, but Mark Cousins comes off as the worst type of hipster.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Have not opened the DVD, but I watched this in the theather and really enjoyed it.  Youtube.com has some great clicks and Tom Cruise does an excellent job.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I've watched a few movies lately and this was by far my favorite. It's hard to come up with a new idea. I've been getting tired of all of the ex special forces guy down on his luck and the wrong people messed with him stuff and the super heroes and the coming of age blah blah blah and so on. I haven't seen anything quite like this one, but maybe I live a sheltered life. It's best to see this knowing nothing. I've seen some negative reviews that seemed kind of conceited as it's just a movie. I can't think of any I've seen lately without plot holes or a need to suspend your disbelief to some degree or other.  Just see with the expectation of having fun. Enjoy!
1451666179|5.0|I read the first few pages and I'm already hooked! I'm a big fan of Allie's blog and this book is an extension of her wonderfulness. A great gift for anyone on your list!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wow! I thought Grisham was sort of running out of stories. Not so!!! I have read them all & found the Racketeer to be one of the best!
B00G32OER4|1.0|Redundant claptrap that didn't spook me one iota. Some decent technical flourishes but nothing more. A WASTE of my time and money in every way shape and form. No more needs to be said.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|The script, cast, setting and direction are excellent and entertaining. The character of George is perfectly understated and we see him and Emma transformed by their physical, emotional and mental bonding. It is however hard to believe the 16 year age difference.
B00EIBO8UK|5.0|This is a fun and quirky despite being a seemingly generic story.  What makes it great is how everything is written and blended into a beautiful fun film.  This is my favorite movie.  Love the cast, story and how it flows with such a large casts that all seems to connect with one another.  Great writing and direction with an excellent soundtrack.<br /><br />This is an interesting dramatic romantic comedy, with a new take on pointing out love.  I give nothing away.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Mentally engaging!! A pleasant surprise. I tried to avoid it for a long time because I didn't want to get hooked. So much for that bright idea
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Today I lost out on points because one portion of the game freezes.  This is a frequent problem. Many players in the Facebook comments complain about this issue. I don't have this problem with other games.
B0091WNK8M|3.0|Fun movie with enough laughs to break up some kinda scary situations/scenes. There is one character that is a little too disturbing for children under 7.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book even more after seeing the movies.  I wanted to refresh my memory of what lies ahead for Katniss and Peeta in the next sequence of the movies.  Unlike other books made into movies, the movie version and book enhance one another. I a
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|What a fantastic story, told in a charming, fun, and beautiful way. The art and animation are gorgeous, the story charming and captivating. This Blu-ray is a must see for any Ghibli or anime fan.
B009LDD22U|5.0|If you know the show, you know why you bought this.  If you do not know the show, then here are a few reasons to get thi s...<br /><br />The main cast is fun and interesting with their own personalities that add to some of the best writing around. The cast has been expanded now with Amy (Sheldon's gf) and Bernadette (Howard's wife) and they have been slowly expanded and part of the ensemble.<br /><br />Witty, fun, intellectual but as common as anyone you know.<br />Serious but a bit of an ass-Sheldon,<br />Sexy-Penny,<br />Shy until he talks-Raj,<br />Loud and in-your-face-Howard,<br />Awkward-Leonard<br />Outspoken-Bernadette<br />Direct and to the point-Amy<br /><br />I have watched the show since the beginning and hope it stays around for at least five more seasons!  Love this series.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|They are used in stations across the world . The sound is top notch! they can be used not just in the studio ( I'm a radio dj ) but also on live broadcasts as well. they are comfortable, and easy to store away.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|it is a rare book that you read and think about a month later. You will be thinking and wishing to reread it in years to come.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King IS the King!  Love that we find out what happens to Danny after the Overlook Hotel.<br />Everything I want in a book and more!
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I use this with Weber FireStarter Lighter Cubes and a good oak charcoal. Starts easily and rapidly. This is the smaller version of the two that are available. Just right amount of charcoal for my Lodge L410 Pre-Seasoned Sportsman's Charcoal Grill.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Overall, I think the series was written well and kept things interesting. This last book slowed down a little, but it made up for it in the end. Definitely surprising.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|Reminds me of the 80's and Depeche Mode days. This album has some great fun songs with a great beat to workout to.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|Lovely movie, where the hero shows us that dreams can come true, with scenes that leave no one indifferent, widely recommended
B008JFUS5A|5.0|***spoilers possible ...***<br />Excellent YA action movie. I'll be honest in saying that I don't remember much about the book. It's probably been a few years since I heard the audio CD. The movie's almost good enough to make me want to return to it, but I remember loathing the third book.<br /><br />Rumors said this movie was better than the first and I agree 100%. I remember the first starting out with a needless bout of shaky cam that just ticked me off. This one started out with a sweeping view of rich, green forests.<br /><br />It's got a nice mix of action and story building to keep you from checking your watch too many times, though there was a time or two I checked. Katniss is beautiful and defiant. Gale's not in it a whole heap but we assume he's off doing his thing. Peeta's there and pulls off the wounded semi-lover thing well.<br /><br />It's a good enough stand alone movie, I'm tempted to buy it just 'cause.<br /><br />Update: I've seen it twice now, so I can say that it does have replay value, which is probably something you want to hear if you're considering buying the dvd or blu-ray when it comes out. The second time around, I got to pay more attention to the details, like the particulars of each of Effie's outlandish outfits. BTW, I'm not a huge fashion guru, but one of my favorite scenes during Caeser's interview of Katniss when her dress does its thing. Very powerful moment in the story.<br /><br />Update (12/2/13): I've seen it 3 times. Some of the slower parts were a little more painful this time around, but I'm happy to report that I still enjoyed the overall experience. Also, this time around, I got to focus on a lot of side details. I've come to appreciate Effie's character development a bit more. She goes from complete airhead to someone who understands how much the situation stinks for Katniss and Peeta and the tributes in general.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is my favorite Hosseini book yet. It's like a much simpler \\"The Grass Dancer\\" and I absolutely loved it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I read many of these reviews and agree that it was much more poorly written that the first two (Did she feel rushed? Felt she had to stretch to make all the peices fit?)  That it seemed nonsensical at times.  And that it was really hard to tell between Tris and Tobias- I had to check many times to remember whose voice it was.  And finally, like so many, I hated the ending.  I did fall in love with Tris and her spririt and her strength.  And I fell in love with Tris and Tobias's love story.  I felt like they spent three books battling, trying to do what was right for so many others, that they deserved so much more in the end.<br /><br />I went to Ms. Roth's blog to get her take and I actually understood it.  After reading her blog, I realized got what Ms. Roth was doing the minute I read those final tragic moments of what happened to Tris.  Tris finally figured out what being truly selfless meant, she finally understood what her parents had lived for and had been trying to teach her.<br /><br />So I get it.  But it doesn't mean I like it.  In fact, I hate it.  Death and sadness happens too much in real life, and now even the character I have grown so fond of throughout three books (which I do to escape reality) dies?  Nope, I don't like it.  Yes, of course I am sad about it.  So unfortunately as much as I understand Ms. Roth's perspective, it did ruin it for me.  I will not read the books again.  And I will not go see the movie.  Why do I want to see a movie where I know it's going to end so tragically?  I can watch the news instead.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|A game for my 8 year old or me. Some of the puzzles are really difficult to solve. I highly recommend this game.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|This album shows the transition that Dylan went thru and became Electric! I can't for positive this is the first album that went electric, but has some awesome tunes on it and is one of my favs.
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|This app will truly be enjoyable for any sports fan, especially boxing fans (serious or casual). I have enjoyed it for hours on end.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|She has a beautiful voice.  I like all of the songs on this CD.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I like to play this tape often and miss seeing Susan Boyle on TV. Hope that she is sharing her gifts somewhere, because it is such a great story and provides hope in life.
1451666179|5.0|Speaking as someone who grew up with chronic depression, this collection of Allie Brosh's blogs could very easily function as a &#34;How to interact with and understand the basics of Depression.&#34; She clearly is familiar with difficult and prickly states of being that she proceeds to somehow observe in herself and then narrate those observations with brilliance. It is touching, tragic, hilarious and off putting all at the same time. Her attitude and style create a narrator, at least as far as I was concerned, that I simply had to like regardless of how horrible her recounting of past events got.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This was a very entertaining and fun filled movie.  The spin on the old Jack & The Beanstalk story is excellent.
B005COO1X6|2.0|King has been one of my favorite writers since I was in 4th grade and unfortunately, this short story just fell flat. The ending was terrible! The guts of the story was going great and then it just went nowhere....needs more work!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Classic Film Horror, craftily packaged for TV.  Knockout performance by Jessica Lange.  A heartthrob from my youth.  Still gorgeous these years later.  The second season has few return actors, in entirely new roles.  But the first season was incredible.  And nicely tied up for the finale.  No spoilers here, but for horror fans, worth checking out on Amazon Prime Video for free.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Our whole book club enjoyed this book. Many of us did not know about the real orphan trains of America's past, and this book  brought that to light. I enjoyed how the author switched back and forth between the modern day story and that of the past. Parts of the story were heartbreaking, but it was well written.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it. Got it mainly for HBOGO and it wouldn't work until I upgraded my iPad to iOS7 now works like a dream. Very cool!
B00000J2PH|5.0|I used to have this vinyl and decided to replace it after seeing how good the price was for the CD and the bonus of being able to download from amazon whenever I want to on my tablet.  Love that feature.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|,:Lots of fun!  Keeps you ocupied for hours!  I would recomend this game for all ages.  Give it a try and see for your self.  You well get hooked.
B000002KDS|5.0|This was a great album! Anyone who is just getting into Cooper, this is a good start and one for the collection for those who love him :)
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Nylund is absolutely spot on in this book. His character development, storyline and flow combined to create an emersive reading experience.  Great job!
B006B7LQ90|4.0|The principles in this book are excellent and applicable even at the lowest level of single individual proprietorship small business. Recommended reading for any one, even a part timer, small business. You should also add 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing' and 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding' and make it a set.<br /><br />I give this book only four stars because: a) toward the last quarter of the book he parsed into separate categories several 'principles' that were really just a single principle and I got the feeling he was just trying to make the book seem more 'rich with information';  b) this information is thirty to thirty five years old (1980,s) and the examples show it. It needed to be updated - it was published 2001; c)  some of the predictions in the book were way off. After thirty five years or so, they now know what really happened and should have explained the reasons, thus adding to real 'richness of information'.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the principles are sound, well tested, and applicable (with some good judgement when doing so).
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|It was very enjoyable movie. It was non stop action.  It was an effective  background for the Lord Of The Rings trilogy.
B000002L68|5.0|Cant go wrong with Prince.  This is my favorite album and I also got the digital version. I bought this as a teen on the vinyl version.
0689835604|3.0|Yes just ok.  Had for my 6 year old but no longer have on my Kindle.  Didn't freeze or stop just was an average application/game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I found this book to be well written and interesting. It wasn't one that I stayed awake to read all night but it was good and I recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had trepidation about this project..The Shining was one of the very first King book that I had read, and just couldn't see a jumping off point that was significantly different, but still honoring the core facts of the original.  King has succeeded here.
B000FC10H0|5.0|One of the best straight forward, to the point, apply immediately and get a better result books you can buy on a marketing subject.<br /><br />I had worked in the business world for fifteen years before I started my own one man operation twenty eight years ago. I have read many marketing books, I read economic, marketing, and small business articles all the time, and I focus on those same subjects on news and talk shows ('Your Business&#34; w/ J. J. Ramberg Sunday mornings on MSNBC, etc.).<br /><br />This book is one of the best collections of immediately applicable high quality marketing information you are ever going to find. There may be many books just as good as this one, but none better.<br /><br />P.S. You should also buy 'The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing' and 'Positioning' by the same authors. They will be the best set of marketing books you will own.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works as stated! Very useful since I have a bunch of old macbook chargers laying around which previously couldn't be used with my new macbook air.
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|What can I say, I bought this album when it was first released.  This is a great value and today it showed up in my Amazon Music app as a download , which I did not expect.  Its a great deal.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Yes just ok.  Had for my 6 year old but no longer have on my Kindle.  Didn't freeze or stop just was an average application/game.
0743201140|3.0|The book is ok. The &#34;free&#34; online Strengthsfinder test was the problem.<br /><br />The password to access to the test it does not work, so I got the book but without the test. This is not a good deal to me.
0307730700|5.0|This memoir about Navy Seal, Adam Brown, was inspiring and probably my favorite read. I have never cried reading a book. I felt as if I lived through the book and saw every step Adam took throughout his life. I felt close to his family. Eric Blehm did an amazing job capturing Adam's life story. Adam is an inspiration to any human being and it's sad that the worst things happen to the best people. He was a brave warrior and I will never forget reading about his life. RIP Adam Brown.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love the game but I loose my gold if my wifi glitches and the game acknowledges that there was a blip but nothing is refunded.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|The product is not as easy to use as they make it sound.  The directions to put it together are not clear and it took experimenting with it to find out I had it put together wrong.  The directions to cut and get a clean break are bad and so far I have had no luck it making a nice even cut/break.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|A great talent that died too early.  I had heard great things but still hadnt read anything by him, but this really made me interested in reading more.
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|Yes just ok.  Had for my 6 year old but no longer have on my Kindle.  Didn't freeze or stop just was an average application/game.
B00G3HSF7O|2.0|Had high hopes for this movie, but it was a total let. Matt Damon was good, but the story was bad!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me : Minion Rush is a wonderful game  and I don't say that allot about game's. But I do wish there were more o obstacles .
B00FN8FCO8|3.0|this album sounds great because Korn  plays awesome but have you noticed the sellout sound and the producer wrote most of the songs.  wake up people were getting ripped off again like RISK and st. Anger from the other great metal bands
0060578793|4.0|This book had a lot of advice in it that was helpful, even if you don't intend to live off the land it has a loot of basics that people need to be aware of.
B0012GTZFC|3.0|The appendices (highly mentioned in the text of the book) do not appear in the Kindle version of the book.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Ms Moriarty has written an excellent and captivating story where lives are interconnected and characters share so much. We all never realize the depth of our actions and how others are effected. The snowball of a lie or hidden truth is unimaginable. Read this book to find out how big the snowball can get!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Another winner from David Baldacci. What an amazing author! This is the first King and Maxwell book I've read. I love that his books have so much depth, intrigue, excitement, suspense and mystery. There are many scenarios, many characters, and plots which leaves the reader constantly trying to solve the mystery. I was shocked when the truth was revealed and highly recommend the book.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Best game ever it never freezes I personally think that it is the best game ever it is also so addictive love the game.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|I got this amplifier because when I bought the &#34;Seenheiser PXC 450 with NoiseGard&#34; headphones, the Amazon &#34;Frequently Bought Together&#34; showed this amplifier and a wire to use directly the 30 pin connection from the iPhone, the truth is that I cannot see the difference in the sound quality or volume, I've been testing the iPhone 4s with the amplifier and without it, and there is no difference to me.<br /><br />I've tested with the FiiO L3 Line Out Dock, and the &#34;FiiO L8 Line Out Cable Stereo Right Angle 3.5mm to 3.5mm&#34; and I honestly cannot see any improvement in volume or bass.<br /><br />If you want to use it with iPhone 4S, PX450 better think twice.
B000002A3T|4.0|Life-long Pink Floyd fan.  Bought this CD on the day it was released.  Always liked it.  Never loved it.  Listening to it now, after years on the shelf and nearly 20 years after its initial release, I'd say that there are about 5 songs on here that have what it takes to be Floyd:  The two instrumentals, \\"Cluster One\\" and \\"Marooned\\" (both excellent!); \\"High Hopes\\" (of course); and the two 'talking' songs \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" and \\"Keep Talking\\".<br /><br />The other half dozen tracks wander into mellow, nondescript adult contempo territory (dare I say bordering on filler?) and sound much more like Gilmour's solo stuff, even though Wright and Mason were involved.  I like all of Gilmour's solo albums, but I wouldn't have labeled any of them Pink Floyd.  The David Gilmour Experience.<br /><br />Call it what you want.  I suppose it is about what one would expect from a middle-aged Pink Floyd in the mid-90s:  a well-produced, even-keeled album and a reasonably pleasant listen.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This may well be the first trilogy where I have ever felt all three books solidly merited 5 stars (or whatever the top rating available happened to be). I was amazed by Brandon Sanderson's masterful world creation and story crafting. I sincerely feel that crafting a series that keeps things interesting and exciting at just the right level must be difficult, but Sanderson pulls it off seemingly with ease. I grew attached to the chracters and enjoyed their distinct personalities and how they grew and changed over the course of the three books. The various plot twists were well done; some with enough hints that I was able to figure them out in advance with others catching me completely off guard, but still making sense with the benefit of hindsight (rather than being shocking simply because the reader was not given enough information to possibly be able to predict what would occur). Some twists seemed to have been planned very carefully from the first book and had been set up so delicately that they were not obvious or contrived at all (if they were not planned in advance, still credit is due to Sanderson for being able to use seemingly minor elements of the story so cleverly to have greater reasons later on).<br /><br />Even character deaths were well done (I won't say more for fear of spoiling things).<br /><br />There were perhaps a couple moments where it felt things were getting repeated overly much in this particular book (largely some of Sazed's mopings or Spook's thoughts). In the context of their thoughts though, it makes sense... the topics seem like things people would mull over repeatedly. Perhaps you can tell I'm grasping for anything I can call a flaw here to try to make this a more critical review. Honestly though, this series simply blew me away. Many many thanks to Mr. Sanderson for an amazing read... I'll definitely be checking out more of his work. I highly recommend this novel to anyone remotely interested in fantasy. Absolutely, mind-bogglingly incredible series.
B008N1V11U|4.0|I mean I love it but it basically it on only 5 or  6 buttons<br />But other than that it is well okay so you should be okay
1609611543|5.0|Nice to see that an allopathic cardiologist &#34;gets it&#34;. Slowly but surly the tide is turning. This book should be required reading.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|A few fantasies can draw one into a world both so absolutely alien and yet seemingly familiar. This is one.  Brandon Sanderson weaves religion, philosophy, politics, psychology into a gripping, almost swashbuckling, adventure with tragically human heroes and evil characters who are often revealed as misunderstood heroes, set against the emotional backdrop and power of absolute end times.  Most of all, you are left touched by the central heroine of the story who worms her way into your heart slow and steady, until, by the end, you realize that you will remember her for the rest of your life.  If you like fantasy, and perhaps even if you don't, simply read this story and be moved and left thoughtful.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Lots of action. For me Sean Connery IS James Bond, but Daniel Craig does give the character that same kind of feel.
B001IF252M|3.0|I'm pretty sure it only cost about $.05 to make one of these, but like all things Apple,...it is EXPENSIVE!  (that being said,...I love my apple products, so I guess I'm part of the problem)  Anyways, this works just as it should.  Unfortunately it comes at a ridiculously high price.  DO NOT buy the cheaper versions.  I've tried in the past and you will get stuck with a $5 piece that doesn't work.  Guess that's why Apple's version is so high?  It does work!
0316055433|3.0|I'm giving it three stars because the first half or so was terrific (although a young teenaged narrator, however well-educated, would not use such an unrelenting tide of cultural references/scholarly turns of phrase!).  Then, I started skipping ahead -- an indicator that I'm having trouble staying in the world of the book.  I love Donna Tartt's writing -- her masterpiece, I feel, was The Little Friend -- but I think she tried to cover too much ground in the space of one (very long) book.<br />And that narrator really got on my nerves.  The only character who really made sense was Boris!<br />Perhaps, some day, they'll find the book's editor wrapped in pillowcases and packing tape, stowed in a Manhattan storage unit...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|But you don't have to spend money to play and have fun. You likely will want to spend money to beat a level.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|This was a gift for my mother and she just loves it.  She loves the songs and the beautiful voices of the men who sing.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This book was fantastic. Amazon has been recommending it to me for years, and for some reason it never sounded that interesting. I finally bought it when I needed a few dollars more to get free shipping (it was on a special bargain price at the time), and I regret not buying it sooner! Fans of classic Gothic books like Wuthering Heights will love this story.
1619698463|5.0|A &#34;must&#34; read for everyone of all ages!<br />A good education to knowing how to eat without gaining weight and just staying healthy.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie is bound to become one of the new classics, in my opinion.  Very little crude humor in comparison to most modern cartoons, and provides a feel-good story without being shallow or sappy.  Some themes include: reaching outside yourself, caring about others, the importance of feeling like part of a family, and the development of a moral compass.  The minions are, without a doubt, my favorite modern cartoon character and are beloved of my children as well.  Enjoyable for adults and children alike, and Steve Carell is spot on (as usual) with his character.  Highly Recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so fun. I am addicted to the game ,my fav is the beach part and the mall. Those are the easiest for me and the lab. It's great for kids to play on you must have it !!!!!!!!!!!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|It's funny, endearing, and adorable. It's a great take on classic characters. It's a great family movie that even my 2 year old (a fan of monsters in general) could enjoy.
B005ES0ZDU|5.0|We know that the Crocs brand provides excellent quality products, but this product is special because it provides extra comfort due to having double sole, allows feet to find a real rest.
B0082Z447U|5.0|Fantastic story! I highly recommend to any fans of Gothic novels like Wuthering Heights. And the Kindle version was surprisingly good (no major typos or problems).
B005HED11Y|5.0|A must see for anyone who loves Star Trek. Digital remastering really improves it for today's televisions. Smooth streaming, also.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I just love this app. It is the best. Much, much better than Pandora, Slacker, i Heart Radio. I have really fallen in love with this app. I have it in my tablet, and my Smart phone. There are a lot of music apps but this one I give it five stars.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Damn...Not the ending I was expecting.  Now I am disappointed that I have to wait for the next book.  Again, George R.R. Martin has crafted a story that makes you want to hold on for dear life as the heads roll and we race from one vignette to another.  The dwarf has more lives than a cat and Snow is coming into his own.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is awesome because it make my Kindle lag less and now it charged fast and I charged more than usual my Kindle used to charge to 80% percentage now it goes to 100%! So that's why it's awesome.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game should not have Oregon trail attached to it at all. I downloaded it thinking I was going to get to play a new version of a game I loved as a kid 20 years ago. nothing about this game is Oregon trail, it is basically the sims under a different name.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|This is my first Joe Bonamassa album. Before buying this one I'd heard of Joe Bonamassa but never actually heard his music. A friend recommended this one so I bought it as an introduction to Bonamassa.<br /><br />This turned out to be a very good album. It's a mixture of Joe Bonamassa compositions with some well known and not so well known compositions by other artists, including Robert Johnson (Stones In My Passway), Willie Dixon (I Got All You Need), Bill Withers (Lonely Town Lonely Street), Howlin' Wolf (Who's Been Talking) and Tom Waits (New Coat of Paint).<br /><br />Overall a very good album; Bonamassa is an excellent guitar player. After this introduction to Joe Bonamassa I'll be checking out some of his other albums.
B008JFURKG|3.0|The first RED was very entertaining.  The story of improbable retired CIA, KGB, and MI6 Agents working together and being chased by bad guys/ current CIA operatives.  I enjoyed the banter and situations from start to finish.  RED2 really fell short, IMHO.  It was just OK.  The cast was great, but the story wasn't nearly as good as the first.  I found RED2 to be barely entertaining.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I'm trying the Pulse again, and I have to say that my second unit is working well so far.  I did a few things differently, which may have improved my experience - I charged the pulse before trying to connect or update.  Even though the first time (see below) the pulse seemed ready to go, I let it charge for a few hours first.  I was also meticulous about inserting the mini-usb - properly inserted, the connector is _almost_ but not quite flush with the side of the pulse.  Since it is pretty cold outside, I also let the pulse sit for a day before I opened it, just to be sure that it had come up to room temperature.  With all these steps, the pulse synced to the iPhone 4S without difficulty, and updated smoothly.  It now seems to be working well.  While I'd like to think that the first pulse was bricked due to crashing while updating, I can't exclude operator error.  Once we connected, I also have to say that Withings support was responsive and timely.    I'll update again after I use it for a week or two, but the out of the box experience was much, much better this time around.    (Updated after one week - so far the Pulse is performing as advertised.  I've had no problems syncing, battery life is excellent, and monitoring steps, altitude, and sleep has been excellent.  I'm already getting some data about my sleep quality which is useful, and having the step meter has been a genuine motivator to take the stairs, etc.  Very neat little device - I'm glad I gave it a second chance.)    (Updated again after one year - I'm using this daily, and there have been no problems with operation.  It continues to sync well with my phone and holds a charge for at least 2 weeks.  Getting feedback on steps has definitely encouraged me to exercise more.)  ***  (this was my original review)  Unfortunately, this product ended up as a very small, 8g brick.  A very expensive bit of Lego, if you will.  It is a nifty idea, and perhaps I'll try it again when the manufacturing is more solid.Product arrived uncharged, and I plugged it in to charge.  After a few minutes, it booted up, and started the syncing process with my iPhone 4S.  This seemed to go well, and the Pulse indicating that it was updating.  At some point in this process, it shut down, never to wake again.  I tried charging, resetting (holding down the button for 15-20 seconds) and did not see anything on the display.    I emailed Withings (included the MAC address and everything), but did not hear back from them in 48 hours, so this is going back to Amazon.    It looks like a very neat product, but whether through design or manufacturing, perhaps not ready for prime time.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Romance, Fantasy, Drama and character development.  A burning page turner with more plot twists than a dragon's tail.  I never knew when the next shoe, sword, or head will drop.  I ended up going to work each day tired, sleepy and wanting the clock to hit 5 PM so I can return to reading more.
B00G6YH6G0|5.0|The book is quite enthralling.  Characters are well drawn and the plot is well constructed.  The author's description of the characters is well worth the reading.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|angry birds is angry birds. you either like it or you don't. I think it's a fun way to waste a little time. this free version is fun but with all the alternative versions out there they can be more exciting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is the best TV series I have ever watched.....watched all 3 seasons in a few days! Love love loved it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good waste some time. It would be better if can earn more energy and diamonds.I like that I don't have to spend real money.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's very breath taker book...I love this book and it is a must read book for you who likes adventures!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|One of TV's greatest characters ever does his clever thing in ever episode ever.  Not only is Peter Falk great,  but the writing,  guest acting,  producing of these shows is just so much classier and intelligent than most other programs.  Great stuff done with pride and integrity.
B007T8BYWE|3.0|This one is ok. But other flipflip are more fun. Wish there were more puzzles per screen. This one is not all planes.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I just said it is cool, and it has helped me with my French and i do awesome. I passed my teacher who gave the assignment and she is far behind Mexico. The only downside is that you can`t stream
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|Since releasing Dummy in 1994, Portishead's mission statement with new material seems to be &#34;deeper, darker.&#34; This worked out well with their eponymous second album, since they left room to expand. That record was an excellent example of stoking the apprehension of their original release to full-blown menace. With 'Third', however, the band is approaching some asymptotic limit in their aesthetic. A friend of mine put the record on when she first got it, and it took far too long for us to realize she'd set it at 45 instead of 78. Even at the right speed, it's an eerie circus of gnashing and wailing. Perhaps it sounded like a statement to some people, but I couldn't hear it as anything other than Portishead trying to out-Portishead Portishead. They've taken their sound, shaved its head, died its stubble black and put a dog collar on it.<br /><br />What a shame. Of course we all expected great things. I wish they'd been genuinely adventurous, instead of faking it with this drivel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome. It's the best game that I have ever played on my kindle fire HD. This game is awesome!
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|What I liked the most about this book was all of the intriguing short stories. I loved the mixture of the modern and sci fi mixed together. The stories were so captivating that I couldn't put the book down. I had to read it from the beginning to the end. It's not every author who can create a story let alone several stories that will captivate your attention so much that you just have to keep reading. Well, this is exactly what this book does.  Luca Rossi did a fantastic job with creating these compelling stories. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|If bowling is your thing with a bit of a twist then here you go....A polar bear riding an inner tube hits the pins and you have boost to help you along the way to a 300 game. I had no problem with the play or loading of this game at all. It's easy to pick up on the play of the game.  A cute game for any age and any level players.<br />0 blood factor ( no gore no blood no violence).<br />I hope you enjoy playing this game and good luck bowling your  300 game.

0394800184|5.0|A wonderful book for children. I read this to my grandson. He can practically read it himself because he's heard it so many times.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I love the game on my iPhone4 but its spool small! Thank you for bringing it to Kindle! Just wish my accomplishments transferred over but its ok.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This works like you remember..Having been an avid ebay User on the Pc I Like using this mobile version.I think that it could be easier to navigate through. However I may just need to use it more. Great app we do need paypal on amazon also.
030759565X|5.0|A cookbook written by a real person, not some celebri-chef with every tool and gadget available and a penchant for pretentious ingredients. Some of these recipes do call for some slightly exotic ingredients, but they are all well written and easy to follow and most importantly yummy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Lovely without being saccharine, poignant, a strong, fresh narrative. Must read. Beautifully simple but not simplistic. Enjoyable. Appropriate for 12 and up.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|When I saw my friends reading the book, I made fun of them. I thought that the book was only for sissies. One of my friends told me to read the book before criticising it. I then read The Lightning Thief. I just loved it. Now I am a Percy Jackson fan!!
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|You need to watch all three. Before Sunrise then before sunset then before midnight. Very good really enjoyed them. So good.

B00E9A656K|1.0|what a lame game !  no fun intended ! were's the thrill in touching a screen  the olny thing i got was a sore finger big deal
B003B02PFO|2.0|Just too goofy. Good judgment was never an option. Because this is the only Grisham I ever read I didn't care for, I certainly will give the author a pass.
B004G600A4|5.0|Granddaughter asked for this for Christmas.  She was thrilled when she opened it and we all sat and watched it Christmas afternoon.

B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I think it's a pretty good game, I tend to play offend on my free time. It's just like the one on Facebook.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so much fun. Totally addicting and it doesn't he  boring<br /> Dec worth the dollar that it costs
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Fun movie - a little disjointed at time and the FX could be better; however, all in all a fun romp through Stormhold!  A fun movie about romance and good vs. evil...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I finished this book in 2 days! Trust me, you will not want it put this book down! My favorite Nicholas Sparks book yet!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|good games runs great I really like it cool sweet really nice great awesome really like it good nice great
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Impressive!  Strong vocals, great lyrics, and cool song arrangements make this record enjoyable from start to finish.  I really dig the hit song &#34;Royals&#34;, but have also been impressed with how catchy all of these songs are.  And wow, she's still a teenager?  I'm really looking forward to many more great things from Lorde.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Enjoy the game, have not found a place where I am instructed on how the whole thought process can be evaluated. What moves give me the best results.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I'm a fan but would love this even if I weren't.  Didn't care for the duet with Elvis..........hokey and unnecessary.  She doesn't need him to sell an album.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Absolutely brilliant read!  Amazing story line that held my attention from start to finish.  A real page-turner!  I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I could not wait to see how it would turn out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I used to watch Netflix using an RGB connection with my laptop.  When Chromecast arrived on the market I was willing to risk the $35 for a better experience.  While it seemed to work fine with the laptop, my wireless is sometimes sketchy when connecting in our bedroom.<br /><br />Once while watching a movie in another room on my new desktop (which uses an ethernet connection), Netflix asked if I wanted to watch on TV or Chromecast.  Well, three rooms down the hall I now have a perfect connection with no interruptions.  Well worth the money!
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I read this after reading The Book Thief and am not disappointed, Zusak's style of writing makes you feel as if you are part of the story. I Am The Messenger does not allow you to venture a guess as to what will happen next, the story flows so consistently it just takes you there. You will enjoy the ride. I am now a Zusak fan and look forward to the next adventure.<br /><br />Buy the book the message is worth every penny.
B0014JGDUC|5.0|I have a wide foot in front and average elseware. This shoe is not always in the local store at this time of year. I am happy to see they are available from Amazon. The shoe fits my foot and has enough support to wear all day on hard floors without too much fatigue to the feet!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Really good.<br />Great game to play and good time killer. Graphics are great and my son loves this game and so do I.
0553593714|3.0|I was disappointed in the type size of this book..............very tiring to read.  Although the story is great, I'll probably buy a hard back to continue the series.
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|I found it a very disturbing book!  I did not like it almost from the start.  Just not my cup-of-tea.  I stopped reading it after a few chapters.  First book I did not finish!
B008DVJO8C|4.0|Maria Brink just has a ridiculous voice.  Enjoyed the cd, for sure get it if your an In This Moment fan, you might like some songs better than the ones they play on the radio, theres other great ones on the cd.
B009APMNB0|4.0|I've had a few of these devices over the years as I do photographic work and also a lot of print work for various companies in the area. Often times I find them to be quite annoying and time consuming as periodically you will always have to sit there and make adjustments to your profiles as monitors get older they need readjustment.<br /><br />Another problem is that some of these devices just don't like to work with some video cards. This one proved to be quite the pain on my lenovo laptop. my Spyder seems to be the only one that likes my laptop.<br /><br />Though my custom built tower that I put together earlier this year likes this unit. x-rite makes a lot of things for photographers and this one is an okay product but I think they might want to stick with their normal photography color cards or at least do a much better job with their drivers as it took a couple tries to get it to work on both computers, well several times on the lenovo.<br /><br />Once in the software it worked okay and seemed to be doing well. I'm waiting on some prints right now to show up that were made after installing this unit but also the same prints from using my spyder as well. It seems that the colors are a little more warmer than I would typically prefer. I would think that they should be more neutral and allow the user to adjust on their own but I have noticed that x-rite likes to emphasize warm in their products. Overall it's a nice product and will certainly get you better results than you had before hand but I like to work from a more accurate base and adjust to my liking from the start.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I'll make it not a secret that I'm a huge Neil Gaiman fan. From the Sandman comics to one of my favorite books ever, American Gods, I can honestly say I’ve enjoyed a great bulk of his imaginative works. With that in mind I will try not to let my admiration of this author get in the way of my review.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is about a boy (though a man at the very beginning of the book the book deals with his childhood. So I will refer to him as a boy.) who is never named in the story. I personally think the fact the boy is never named works well for the story given the style which I’ll touch upon later in this review.<br /><br />The boy in the story becomes involved with an odd and mysterious family comprised of three women. Considering that the women were loosely were an old woman, a middle age woman, and a child, I wonder if Gaiman was trying to evoke the imaginary of the triple goddess archetype. It would certainly be fitting.<br /><br />In a fairytale like quality the boy finds himself dealing with forces beyond his knowledge yet in a way is so familiar to any child who has had nightmares or complained of something living under his bed. And the only way to rid him of this dark intrusion is to get help from the Hempstock family.<br /><br />This story reminds me slightly of a preview books of Gaiman's called Coraline. Not so much in plot but in style. Like Coraline, this book has a fairy tale style. It feels like something that you would read to a small child. And like in a fairy tale, more so in their original, grim form, there is that seed of warning and darkness within the story.<br /><br />For rest of review and rating, please check out Musekicker's Reading Place.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think that you should get this game is VERY addicting before this came on kindle I kept on typing in Candy Crush Saga and it would just give cheats and then I typed it in and THERE IT WAS!!! And I think that they should have Clash of Clans on kindle too.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great science fiction movie!  Can't wait for next one... Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic, as is the rest of the cast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is without a doubt one if not the best game I have ever played! Subway Surf is an amazing game because everything is so simple but fun at the same time. If you are a Temple run girl like me, I assure you you will love this game. The controls are cool as you race into a busy subway dodging things such as Santa, freight trains, and construction obstacles! Skate, jump, and roll through this fantastic game . As I guarantee you will enjoy it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I chose this one because I love this game.<br />If I had to tell one's to play a game this is one of them.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|intricate weaving of several stories in one. suspenseful, keep me wanting to read more each time I picked up the story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was waiting for this game. I am glad this finally was made available for my kindle.Happy this was free.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|This game is AWESOME the game is a lot of fun but I wish  the every mission was  free because their are only three mission other than that the game is AWESOME.
B00992CF6W|4.0|For my kids who love Minecraft, this is a very workable version of the game that they will play on longer trips.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|great nostalgia,acting with scenes a good story.Spectacular scenery and costumes with music to fit the time period.I was not disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addicting. It is good for all ages and is really fun! I seriously recommended this app.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's timeless classics of SciFi... already. Almost all Card's books are good, but this is one I read first, and it probably was best... although fans of Elvin Maker saga probably will disagree with me... Just buy this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Wish that it updated sooner so I can do more like on pc or xbox edition also I'd like to be able to look in crafting tables on creative and I wish there were more items
B00884GR0W|5.0|Okay this game...no this legend is the best mobile game I've ever played. It has fantasy role play mining quest and people and etc. Just the music sounds beautiful to me. And I'm only 13. But anyway this is definitely worth the pay.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Mad About the Boy surpassed my expectations! I loved the book, because Bridget is the same person still living in England-just different circumstances, such as being a Mom! Bridget still has her diary but also uses new technology such as twitter! Bridget still has her brilliant sense of humor and circle of friends. Thank you Helen Fielding for bringing Bridget back! I might read this book twice!
B0000CFW87|4.0|If you like his singing, you will like this album.  As good as the rest.  No surprises here.j  Similar to his other stuff.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Most interesting. Could not put it down.I liked the way Suzanne dident underestamate her readers and repeate herself to fill space.the whole book was interesting and ended well.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Amazing movie, but be prepared to be depressed. This movies content haunted me for days afterward. The acting was excellent, the content disturbing. I would recommend this movie, but be prepared to not want to fly on a plane or have a cocktail ever again.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  The storyline is during a time that I remember as a young child so it brought back a lot of memories for me, both good and sad.  It'll make you laugh and cry.  Excellent cast, acting is superb!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It fits my needs perfectly.  Small, lightweight, and sharpens my knifes very well.  I keep it in my every day portable kit where I sometimes have to hunt for it.  I've sharpened a high carbon(non stainless) hunting knife with a nine inch blade and the result was just fine.
B005H2IAM6|5.0|Because I love the anime version, but there is something wrong with it. It takes forever to load and when It's done and I turn off the the player it has to reset all of it functions. Why send me something that isn't right for US players. You know where I live.
B000LYCNJQ|5.0|At first I ordered the wrong screen for this CD.  I didn't see how to cancel and then re-order what I needed.  It was rectified within seconds of the phone call.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think it's a good game so far. It has a lot of potential to be even more popular. But, it does get a little hard when you're trying to get the investment points. Hope they fix it.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|anything from Eminem I like! this is not my favorite cd, but I liked that fact I got it first thing on the release day when I pre-order!  I love Prime too!
B008602KQI|3.0|First hour of the movie is very boring and slow. I also hate the color of the movie as well.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|It's a great game. ! I enjoy playing this game! It's time consuming but it is really entertaining! Buy it buy it buuuyy itt!!!
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|Great film.  I really liked this &#34;prequel&#34;.  Well worth the buy.  That said, I watch Amazon Streaming using my Roku player.  When I watch it that way, there are no bonus features attached to the video (or at least none that I can find).  They seem to be there when I load it in Firefox on my PC (the video length appears much longer), but I prefer to watch movies on the old 42 inch set.  Any ideas?
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is the first casual game I've played where the pressure to buy things and use the game with Facebook is barely there. Both situations are asked about during game play but not in the way most games will shove it in your face. I've been playing for hours with continuous things to do, the wait time for things is not as absurd as wait times in other games for items. All around genuinely pleased.<br /><br />-Waited until level 11 to make review.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Yes, Yes, Yes, the definitive collection for every big music fan. I believe hundreds of years from now this collection will be worth a small fortune as The Beatles legacy will better than rival music from Bach, Beethoven, Mozart etc..... Their music changed the world and the way we think today. Everything we listen to today is truly based on their chops. I'm not a big fan of John Lennon but I must say he was a genius along with Paul and George....I like Ringo but he was in the right place at the right time.
B002R5QPRI|2.0|I watched this as a teen and it was great, watching it again I got the feeling that Kevin Costner really did not want to do that film.  The music was enjoyable.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|being a hug Sabbath fan I expected the best album in their life!....Well it's not really but it's not heaven and hell a cd I never played more than 6 times in a row to  the day I got it to try to get the feel and let it grew on me because any other Sabbath besides ozzy's version is not the real thing(Dio's Sabbath was the best of the lot but it could never replace Ozzy in black Sabbath ) 13 is good honest 70's like inspired Sabbath but I sort of falls short of the might old school black Sabbath but this is honestly not the original Sabbath either Bill Ward is missing and seriously missed behind the drums they should have given bill the 25%$ he wanted! it's his and it always was and will be he's 1/4 of the original band he is a metal music national treasure as is Tony or Geezer or Ozzy! Well this cd is very good and but the best tracks are the bonus tracks they seam to have that old Sabbath sole and feel-more than some  of the other 8 standard tracks. the point  this is possibly not the amazing album you wanted to hear after 35 years wait sadly but it's not a horrible disappointment either just a bit of a let down and something that grows on you a bit but the bonus song are the best songs in my eyes!
B00FN3HRG4|4.0|Barbra's latest concert dvd is great. The only draw back that I can tell is her vocals aren't as pure as they were when she was younger. Sadly, her voice has more of an rasp to it. I know she can't help it because her voice changes as she has gotten older. Barbra truly seems like she is having a lot of fun on stage. She's performing songs that she has never sung live in concert before. Which is an huge plus.<br /><br />Barbra is an much better singer then most of the modern singers of today. It's really remarkable that that at 71 years old she can still sell tickets and people still go to see her sing. I also wish as an bonus they would have put in Barbra singing with her half sister Roslyn kind there duet of Get Happy/ Happy Days are Here Again that Streisand originally performed with Judy Garland on her TV show from back in the early 60's. The documentary I Remember Barbra was a nice edition to the dvd. If your an Streisand fan this is an good edition to your ever growing Barbra collection.
1556438850|5.0|This book is VERY helpful. It gives a really good run down of anything you'd need to know for teaching yoga-ideally you've gone through or are going through the teacher training. This makes for a good quick reference guide when you're looking to put a class together or have a question regarding some of the spiritual aspects of yoga and it helps when setting out to create a certain space for a class.<br /><br />I think it's worth it for teachers just starting out. It obviously can't cover everything, but it's a great, great run down. It would work really well too for an advanced student looking to explore the subject matter further-not so much information to overwhelm you as a self studier, but certainly quite a bit to set you on the path to learning more.
B003O86FMW|4.0|On the edge of my seat all the way through. I had to pull an all nighter for this one.<br />CindyKay
1781162646|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book as I love all Stephen King Books, although it was not one of my favourites  :)
0793518326|3.0|Book was in mint condition; however, the print is so small it made it difficult to read the notes.  Tried to play several songs on my guitar and piano and it was almost impossible to do.  Passed it on the the local library to resell and it is still there after months.  It wasn't a good investment for me as far as I'm concerned.
B005544TRQ|4.0|The series was a pleasant surprise to me. I did not expect such a well done drama surpassing most of the others out there. It is as good as &#34;Mad Men&#34; although I prefer the 50's era of Mad Men reenactment and better than &#34;Breaking Bad &#34;. Of course these are personal choices. I watched the interview of the actors and writer which was a plus. I had a marathon of Suites until I ran out of episodes. Please keep them coming.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book is great because it helps you learn that is why I gave all star. Don't have any dislikes because it helps. I would recommend to people who need help.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I am anxiously waiting for season 6 to come out on DVD. Nathan Fillion as Castle and Stana Katic as Beckett work well together though the writers need to keep Castle's off-beat nature in check and please Stana settle on a hair style - maybe that of the second season.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I would enjoy this A LOT more if there were more rooms. It's actually a little challenging which is definitely something I look for.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|The new mixes of The Band's live performances in 1971 brings new joy to these old gems.  Not just another release of old material.
034580404X|5.0|fabulous read!  couldn't put it down, now i know what all the fuss was about.  Simply captivating highly recommend to anyone with a pulse.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome<br />Free game the best game I have played ever<br /><br />Better than the rest of the games like this .
B001JRB16U|5.0|Love the story.  Had it on VHF for my now 20-year-old granddaughter.  Needed it on DVD to share with my second (4 year-old) granddaughter.  No, not the same parents. :-)
0316247545|5.0|My daughter is into my Little Pony and the book just puts everything together. Her friends at school want the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my opinion is that I like this game because the minions are just running for their life its so funny too!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I &lt;3 this game! Everybody loves it! I wonder if you can put flint &amp; steel on creative mode to blow up dynamite. I also think you should spawn mobs on creative. Probably, just probably, you could make spawn animals and spawn mobs on survival mode. Besides that, this game is EPIC! It should be a ONE THOUSAND STAR game (if it's possible.)

B00G9TR60I|4.0|A little bit cheesy in the beginning, but on an overall scale quite an artistic portrayal of life after death.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the graphics of the game, especially the chocolately-looking candy with the sprinkles on it. However, I've played a similar game, I think it had jewels perhaps? That game allows you to  switch and collect all the gems connected to the string- not just in a straight line but at a right angle also. I like that better. But it's a pleasant time filler/distraction from the real stuff.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|King and Maxwell by David Baldacci is a Grand Central Publication released in November 2013. I received a copy of this book from the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />In this sixth installment of the King and Maxwell series, we start off with Sean and Michelle coping with Michelle's near death experience and the physical and emotional scars left behind. As they are about to make plans to take a vacation, they find themselves in yet another murky situation they pretty much just stumbled upon.<br /><br />Tyler is a teenage boy who has just learned his father was killed in action in Afghanistan. He is left behind with a step mother that isn't the warmest person in the world. The other issue Tyler is dealing with is an email from his father sent AFTER his father was allegedly killed.<br /><br />Sam, Tyler's father, accepted a mission in Afghanistan. Things didn't exactly go as planned and now Sam is being hunted by his own country.<br /><br />Tyler has asked King and Maxwell for help. But, there are people that do not want them involved and make that crystal clear, not only to Sean and Michelle, but to Tyler and a few other people that became involved, including the unlikely source of Sean's seldom discussed ex-wife.<br /><br />After years of reading The Camel Club series, I started reading the King and Maxwell series too. The first book in the series left me a little underwhelmed, I must admit. However, I didn't want to dismiss the series out of hand. After reading a few more King and Maxwell novels I have been thankful I stuck with it.<br /><br />This plot was very detailed. Greed and revenge motivated the operation that snared Sam into a plot he patriotically accepted, that was anything but. Baldacci provided an emotional story about a strong father/son relationship and opened new doors in the relationship between Sean and Michelle, which could prove very interesting in the future.<br /><br />Overall a satisfying addition to the series. This one is an A.ies. This one is an A.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My problem with this device is that you have to stream whatever video you are watching through two devices.  Whichever device you are using to control it, phone, tablet, laptop, has to stream the video in order for it to be sent to the device connected to the TV.  This would be a very important piece of information that the manufacturer should provide in its advertising.  I would not have purchased it had I known this.  I don't want to stream through my laptop to watch on tv.  I might as well watch it on the laptop.  Also, Netflix has changed its program and only allows streaming through two devices at a time.  With this device you will be using all streaming ability with one device.  I don't like it because of this.  I wanted a device I could use independently and this is not it.

B00FAVRHBE|4.0|I have mixed feeling about The Day Of The Doctor. In many ways I love it and have already pre-ordered the Blu-ray even before I saw it in the cinema, and I thought the 3D aspect was very good. The best 3D I've seen since the Doctor Who Experience actually which was the best with the Pandorica and Daleks and Matt Smith's Doctor.<br />I enjoyed TDOTD very much but I am a little sad at what could have been, I think Eccleson not doing it was a mistake. It's obvious that it was written with him in mind because Eccleson was the Doctor that was born in war and as wonderful an actor as John Hurt is of course Eccleson should have been there. It also messes up the order because by John Hurt playing an all new Doctor it pushes every Doctor after him forward so now 9 becomes 10, 10 becomes 11 and so forth....<br />My other big complaint is Billie Piper, she is so overused and my least favorite companion in the new series. Besides that to be honest it would have made a LOT of more sense if Clara had been The Moment for John Hurt's Doctor instead of a Rose clone because after all we had just seen Clara enter The Doctor's time stream in The Name Of The Doctor and was able to be in all the places of his life from William Hartnell to Matt Smith. Excepting in these parts I consider TDOTD a success and wonderfully crafted story (note * when Matt Smith is in Trafalgar Square and the TARDIS door is left open we can see inside and the control room is not present but instead we see the inside of the prop! Whoops! Something I fully expect from the classic series but until TDOTD they never missed a beat and normally we would see the control room.)<br />Seeing Tom Baker was a delight and having him come in as the curator to the museum was brilliant and a fantastic nod, 30 years late from appearing in The Five Doctors but at least we see him join this Anniversary Special...<br />I think Eccleson made a huge mistake on this one but it is a joy to have John Hurt in it so as I said, mixed feelings on this all around but that won't stop me from enjoying it.<br />If I had my way we would have had Chris Eccleson instead of John Hurt, a second Clara instead of Billie Piper, the TARDIS control room sliver fixed and Captain Jack Harkness show up! Well... we can't have everything but what we do get is wonderful...
B00GSE92F6|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I cheered at my television set...  it's as if Steven Moffat looked into my most secret Whovian fantasies, turned them on their collective heads, added a whole `nother dimension and then put it all on film in this greatest episode I have ever watched in my 30+ years as a devout fan of the most imaginative sci-fi television series of all time.  The chemistry between Smith and Tennant is nothing short of electric, John Hurt is brilliant (as always) Clara demonstrates once again that she's a companion on a level with Sarah Jane and I even found myself enjoying the presence of Billie Piper (for once), but the Zygons!!!  OMG... talk about fate considering this features the return of one of my all-time favorite aliens from episode 80 which was precisely when I started watching Who as a young child.<br /><br />But it's the story fellow Whovians that will utterly amaze you and I shan't divulge but I will say again that I honestly never imagined in my wildest dreams that the series would take this particular turn nor was I ever more pleasantly surprised.  \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" is easily worth the price of admission so stop balking and just buy and I promise you will absolutely not be disappointed by this 80 minute thrill-ride which ends in unmitigated Doctor Who magic.  :o)

B009K6DKTS|5.0|Taleb loves to be provocative, he enjoys to shake up established beliefs and contest respectable schools of thought, he purposefully wants to blow up comfortable convictions - like a Zen master who is trying to push his disciples out of their beaten ways! His writing is sometimes disconcerting, this is not a rigorous but dry academic book about probabilities, extreme events, complex systems and chaos theory, although it touches all these fields when the author develops his arguments by drawing on numerous examples from many fields, times and thinkers. &#34;Antifragile&#34; seems also to be Taleb's personal liberation from the demons unleashed by his first hit, &#34;The Black Swan&#34;.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|It is a thought provoking movie, well done. Very good acting, some offensive graphics to my eyes.<br />God's love works positively; we need to allow that love to come to others through us.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Which character am I describing? With Cornwell's latest novel, Dust, it's tough to say. The unsubs and those who hunt and trap them approach each other from either side of that fine line which separates good from evil, right from wrong, sane from psychotic.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story line.  I loved the way the different character's lives were meshed together. Very well written. This book has several secrets revealed, as the title suggests, but it's also intertwined with aspects of real life that we can all relate to.  I was sorry to reach the end of the book. I will definitely be reading more books by this author.
B00DMEQP46|3.0|I'm and Mgnt fan, first album was the best, really like the second.  This is still worth listening to, just not at the same level of the previous two.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Based on some of the reviews, I was uncertain about purchasing, but really good story with good character's. I especially enjoyed the message at the end, as I have often wondered about the fork-in-the-roads of my life.
0385350864|2.0|*Spoiler*<br /><br />I read the entire book with as open a mind as I could. While it was not the direction most people would have expected the author take, I can understand why Mark was killed. For Bridget to be single, Mark has to be out of the picture. If they were divorced, something would have had to go wrong. No matter what, some readers would have viewed him as a bad guy. By him dying, he still gets to be a hero and a good man.<br /><br />Then that leaves Bridget to fumble around, making mistakes and having no clue what she is doing. That is the part that bothered me about this book. I find it hard to believe that in her 50s, Bridget still is completely insecure and obsessed over the same things she was in her 30s. There is very little character growth.<br /><br />When Bridget was in her 30s and single, I think a lot of women could relate to what she was feeling and experiencing. I would have liked to see how a slightly more put-together Bridget would have dealt with being a widow and single mother.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like it for the reasons many hate it. First I am up to level 65 and haven't paid a dime, so it can be done. The reason I like it because I am constrained not just by levels and time, but by lives. It forces me to get off and take a break, which for me is good or else I would play it all day. So I like it for that reason, and I like it better than games you continually play. It's cute, I like the graphics because they are smooth I don't like the 3 swipe games that &#34;jump&#34; in to each space - jewel stars does that, and I don't like it too much. Anyway cute game and graphics

B001XV3LSS|4.0|What I love about Contact most, is the imagination.  Without giving anything away, let's just say that it's a ride containing different periods of struggle, persistence and success... even if that success is sometimes limited.  Also, if you're expecting &#34;little green men&#34; from this, you'll be sorely disappointed.  This is a look at one possibility for contact through educated and creative eyes.<br /><br />Jodie Foster as Ellie is spot on for what I'd hope a passionate, atheist, scientist, protagonist would be.  She's stubborn at times when confronting McConaughey's religious character, making her both lovable and frustrating simultaneously.  In the end, regardless of her beliefs, you can't help but to admire her honesty... and the fact that despite having the opportunity to lie or sell-out multiple times, to get what she wants, she never does.<br /><br />My dislike for the flaws (McConaughey's acting, the radical appearance of the religious zealot, Skerritt's frustratingly opportunistic/exploitative personality etc) are far outweighed by the imagination and excitement the movie contains.  In fact, I believe that a script/film of this scope & type could be a breeding ground for inaccuracies, annoyances and loose ends.  While it certainly has some amount of these, at least the latter was in the movie purposefully. The others aren't so heavy that I didn't enjoy the movie, I was able to ignore them and finish the story... I THINK most would be able to do the same.<br /><br />You certainly have the opportunity to leave the movie with more questions than answers, something I view as increasingly rare for today's films (or maybe I'm just watching the wrong ones).  I'm a big fan of films making me think beyond the minute I leave the theatre, or turn off the TV, but even if you aren't... quite a journey.

If I don't want to spend my Christmas money on your stupid game, you shouldn't freeze me out, or make my stuff disappear if I won't buy stuff in app. Deleted it, and moved on, my Mom was right, a good book is better than a game like this any day , no wonder the park didn't work in the movie, the same people who made this game wrote the park software probably.

0880794968|5.0|I've been learning to read tarot for a year. I began learning on an Arthurian Tarot deck and was later gifted a Deviant Moon Tarot Deck. Both of these are based off the Rider-Waite tarot, interpreted through the perspectives of different artists.<br />The Universal Waite Tarot deck contains 78 cards: 22 Major Arcana and 56 pip cards with the traditional images.These images are iconic, making learning to read and interpret the cards easier. The traditional Waite tarot contains images with symbolic features that draw your intuition and subconscious. Many of the symbols are repeated in many cards through the deck, making the relationships between cards easier to determine. This is an especially nice feature for readers who like having a conversation with those they are reading. This simple and iconic images allow the reader to ask, &#34;what do you see in this card?&#34; or &#34;how do you relate to this card?&#34; &#34;What does it make you feel?&#34;<br />I love this about the Waite tarot. In contrast, when I read using the Deviant Moon tarot, the people I am reading for often fear the macabre images. While I can relate to the Deviant Moon, not everybody else can. Yet the traditional Waite has images to which many can relate.<br />I like my Deviant Moon deck because it fits with my current understanding of life, but wanted to see how my deck relates to their original inspiration. The size of the cards are about 2.5X4 inches. These cards aren't as long as my Deviant Moon tarot, making them a bit easier to shuffle, but larger than a deck of Bicycle cards. Depending on shuffling skills, you may want to consider the size of your deck when selecting which deck you will use to read.<br />The glossy cards make shuffling the deck easy and simple.<br />The card backs are designed to keep the direction of the cards hidden until they are flipped. Excellent if you read with reversals, if you don't read with reversals, overlook this detail.<br />A booklet is included to assist with readings that contains both the upright and reversed meanings of each card. The booklet also contains directions for a Celtic cross spread and directions for a divination.<br />Overall, very satisfied with this deck.th readings that contains both the upright and reversed meanings of each card.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun. I thought it would be a kiddie game, surprise surprise. Just like Subway Surfers and Temple Run combined!
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|Fun game.  I liked the way they used real images photoshopped together to create stunning scenes (different look than the usual cartoon graphics),  along with lots of motion and action.  Puzzles were not too hard to complete,  although I did have to use cheats a bit to figure out what to do next.  Game time was at least 4 hours.  Partly because it is not set up to be finished one scene after another,  but instead lots of running around to different scenes to collect items and accomplish tasks, but also because there is simply a lot of puzzles and scenes (about 100) to accomplish.  Well worth the money..
B003JUGQ38|5.0|At the end of the season the writers bring back nearly all the characters from the first 4 season for a grand two episode finale.  They incorporate several of The Doctor's old enemies and put The Doctor into a seemingly impossible situation.  Naturally, this on the viewer having seen all the past episodes for reference but the result if fantastic.  Long live The Doctor!

B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I really enjoy this game!  I read the reviews before getting it as the FAOTD and didn't expect much, but it surprised me.  King Odball is definetly oddball looking with a l-o-o-o-n-g snakelike tongue that he uses to swing rocks.  The front interface is  an overhead view of a map divided into sections.  Each section shows pictures of tanks and you simply tap one of the tanks and your taken to a scene where King Oddball hangs in the sky, like the sun, and there are various layouts of tanks, helicopters and little helmeted characters arranged in various formations.  In most scenes there are three rocks or small boulders hanging in air near King Oddball which he grabs with his tougue and swings back and forth.  The goal is to tap the screen when you want the King to release the rock to strike the tanks, helicopters or little guys.  If you can \\"blow-up\\" everything in the scene with the 3 rocks (and occasionally some gold rocks that result from certain explosions) you get to go back to the map and tap another tank, taking you to another scene where the types and number of components are arranged differently than before.  The game has many interesting variations where some components have shields to break before you can hit the component and explode it.  There are also exploding boxes, big rubber balls, rock barriers, steel beam barriers, etc.  In each section of the map there is also a unique symbol that let's you try various challenges.  For example, one provides a dozen different challenges requiring you to blowup everythingin the scene using one rock.  Every time you fail to blow everything up in a scene with the rocks provided, you are presented two buttons, one to try again (as many times as necessary) and the other to retreat back to the map.  The music and noises are OK and aren't overdone.<br /><br />Overall, I find it to be good fun and somewhat addicting.  There are probably hundreds of different ways to blow everything up in any given scene.  You can strategize by thinking \\"if I release the stone here I can bounce it off the big ball to get it under that overhang and hit that tank\\" or \\"hit the exploding box that will throw those slabs and hit that guy\\", etc.  But as you try to do those things, other things happen that you didn't plan or even expect, and one rock may blow up everything in the scene.  So even if you went through the same scenes over and over and over, it will be fun and different every time.  I often try a game for a little while and dump it, but this one I will probably never remove.  It's that much fun, at least for me!by thinking \\"if I release the stone here I can bounce it off the big ball to get it under that overhang and hit that tank\\" or \\"hit the exploding box that will throw those slabs and hit that guy\\", etc.  But as you try to do those things, other things happen that you didn't plan or even expect, and one rock may blow up everything in the scene.

B008JFUS5A|5.0|[ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW: My discussion of the plot occurs in the fourth paragraph following this one, and should represent no more \\"news\\" than you'd get in the trailer.]<br /><br />This is an absolutely faithful and extremely well-made adaptation of the second book in the trilogy, and for those who are fans of the books (and the preceding film) rest assured; you're going to like this movie. The only caveat I offer is this: CATCHING FIRE concerns itself less with characterization than it does with plot. Big things are happening, and it is the furtherance of those elements that will carry us from The Hunger Games [HD], the first book, to the dramatic events of Mockingjay, the final one.<br /><br />I had really been wondering about this entry in the series, and it was more than just the fact that it was the pivotal entry: I really had a few questions after having read the book. What in fact would this warring arena look like--particularly concerning its \\"boundaries\\"? Were Johanna Mason and Finnick Odair going to meet my expectations? How different will this movie look and feel under the direction of Francis Lawrence (no relation to Jennifer)--who was primarily a music video director, though he directed I Am Legend and Water For Elephants (and will helm the next two parts of MOCKINGJAY, the trilogy's conclusion)?<br /><br />Well, I was pleasantly surprised in all three cases, and more. Not only did the arena hold up well--though I would have liked a little more physical clarity in its climactic scene--but I felt Jena Malone as Johanna and Sam Claflin as Finnick both hit it out of the park. And I found no real faults with Lawrence's direction either; the movie had a suitably different sense this time around, certainly, but I wasn't overly aware that it was any more a directorial choice than it was a narrative one.<br /><br />The plot is only a little different this time around. A very imperious commander-in-chief, President Coriolanus Snow (played by a malevolent Donald Sutherland) is sick not only of Katniss' popularity following her (and Peeta's) survival of the 74th Hunger Games, but also of how that popularity seems to be empowering a rebellious foundation. Believing that her victory came from more strategy than any real prowess, he has decided to do away with her once and for all: he will fill the new year's games with those who survived their own games, and feels sure one of them will be able to end her existence once and for all.<br /><br />I found the movie this time around really came around to three acts: the first concerned the?? , who orders our heroine Katniss to be more convincing at selling the romantic angle between Peeta and herself, OR ELSE. The second act concerned the preparation for the games, and a pretty grim recounting of the various champions Katniss and Peeta will now be forced to face. The final act comes down to the game itself, and how uniquely it will evolve.<br /><br />So, to those who were disappointed by the movie's de-emphasis of characterization, I must admit I am puzzled; the second book was not ABOUT characterization. The only real fleshing out of personalities occurs in terms of what those opponents from the other districts will bring to the game...and one doesn't expect to learn all that much about any one of them. This movie is more about strategies: it is concerned with President Snow's demand that this year's game will serve up Katniss' head on a platter, and he has made himself even MORE sure of that fact by hiring a new Game Master: a self-assured Plutarch Heavensbee (played self-assuredly by Philip Seymour Hoffman). That her death is believed to be so guaranteed is made clear by the plans Katniss and Peeta themselves make with Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who is portrayed less comically and more scrupulously this time around).<br /><br />What this movie also lets us see more openly and with a little better focus is the true manner of the police state that makes up the twelvedistricts, and the ugliness of despotic rule. The numbing effect of Snow's terrifying rule is clarified through not only the fish-belly grey machines and armored men who rule the districts, but also through the morphing portrayals of many of the continued secondary and tertiary characters, none better than in the albeit-so-slight evolution of the uber-flippant Effie, played especially well by Elizabeth Banks.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found this to be an entirely fitting second movie. I've heard others claim it was too long, but I felt just the opposite, and wished it could have been longer. I was shocked when the end came, and I read the book. I so badly wanted more that I hoped the movie would continue past the all-telling nature of Katniss' transforming expression.<br /><br />When all is said and done, I think that might be the truest sign of a motion picture's success. And CATCHING FIRE had that in spades.districts, and the ugliness of despotic rule.

B006AZZPCM|3.0|TubeMate is okay.  I don't like or dislike it.  I just prefer using YouTube.  Can't figure out why I even downloaded it.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I never thought I could get use to not seeing the original Capt Kirk and Spock; however, this movie was awesome.  The plot is great and the movie is action packed with many facets going on at once.  It is well written and I think it was as good as the first one.<br />I hope to see more in the near future.

B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan Boyle has one of the most beautiful voices out there today. Every song on the album is gorgeous, except the part where Elvis sings. I remember him sounding much better than this.<br />This album contains some of my favorite Christmas songs, sung with beauty and expression.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really love Candy Crush.  Friends got me playing - and hooked on it.  I don't like the fact that you have to bother friends to go to another level or pay to move to the next level.  That's why I've given it 4 instead of 5 stars.

0425252868|5.0|A must read for any military or history buff. I tore through this book quickly as I couldn't put it down, a very rare glimpse of compassion in a brutal, ugly war. I would guess anyone who does not read military history would still enjoy this book.

0316204366|4.0|Gladwell is an excellent storyteller, and his books are extremely readable. However his research and thinking are often intended to be provocative rather than informative.<br /><br />For example, he tells a wonderful story about the Biblical David and Goliath, which he says people have not understood for a couple of thousand years. David was certain to win in a fight that was unfair -- he stood at a distance with a sling that fired a stone -- the ancient equivalent of a gun. Goliath had heavy armor and a sword. He could not defend himself well (usually an archer would accompany a swordsman to defend against the slingshot) and could not chase David.<br /><br />But Gladwell is careless, so relying on his work for information will be a mistake. He says Goliath was 6'9&#34; at least -- about two meters. But that is not what the Bible says. It is quite specific. He was 6 cubits and a span. That would be 9'9&#34; -- about three meters. Perhaps he thinks he knows better and the Bible is mistaken, but this is a warning not to rely on everything he tells.<br /><br />I like Gladwell and have been reading his books for many years. Nevertheless, the entertaining anecdotes will lead you astray if you think they accurately show how things work.

B008602KQI|4.0|I like seeing strong female characters who fight back.  Acting was pretty good.  I liked that the fight scenes didn't go on and on, but instead time was used to develop character histories and relationships.
B00FVZAPB8|5.0|Great NEW album by Paul McCartney. Very glad that at 71 (!!) he's still inspired to produce music of this high calibre.<br />As we could expect, with the choice of 4 different producers, it's a very varied collection. Ranging from melodic pop, through straight rock, to ambient, country and simple but beautiful  ballads. But better than expected: no duff tracks this time. It's been in almost constant rotation during my daily commute and I still hear NEW things every day. Highly recommended.

0938045768|5.0|After doing the Insanity Workout (by Shaun T) for 2 months, I see good results on my body, but while I got lots of<br /><br />fat burnt, I still hope to strengthen my power and coordination. For example, I could do lots of full push ups,<br /><br />but never even one single one-arm push up (except spreading my legs really wide and twisting my body, as Paul Wade<br /><br />put it, the &#34;ugly form&#34;) or even a one-leg squat, never mention the one-arm pull up or the crazy stand-to-stand<br /><br />bridge.<br /><br />Now I'm on the first week of doing the Convict Conditioning, but I do it with higher frequency than the schedule<br /><br />recommended by Paul, and let's see if I could continue my own timetable for at least 3 months.<br /><br />My schedule is as follows, it was designed using the principle of Burst Workouts: Simple Quick Routines to Get<br /><br />Lean and Fit by Mike O'Donnell.<br /><br />The basic idea is:<br /><br />Doing Push Up, rest, Pull Up, rest, Squat, rest, Leg Raise, rest, Bridge, rest, Handstand, all on the same day.<br /><br />For each exercise, I use the number of progression as an indicator. For example, Paul recommended 3 sets of 50<br /><br />wall push ups as the progression level, so I try to do 3 x 50. If I feel too easy or too comfortable doing it, I<br /><br />will progress to the next step. If I could finish 3 x 50 but with sore arms or short of breathe, I do the same set<br /><br />again after two days.<br /><br />For example, on the first day, I do it in a sequence as follows:<br /><br />Day 1 ---<br /><br />Doing Wall Push Up: 1 set x 50 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br />Doing Vertical Pull Up: 1 set of 40 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br />Doing Shoulderstand Squat: `1 set of 50 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br />Doing Knee Tucks: 1 set of 40 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br />Doing Short Bridge: 1 set of 50 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br /><br />Repeat the sequence above for three times.<br /><br />Finally, do a Wall Headstands for as long as I could.<br /><br />Day 2 ---<br /><br />A rest day for muscle recovering and doing different exercise, I usually do cycling or some abs exercise.<br /><br />Day 3 ---<br /><br />I found the Wall Push Ups and Vertical Pulls extremely easy and I couldn't feel a thing at all, so on Day 3, I progressed from Wall Push Ups to Incline Push Ups, and Vertical Pulls to Horizontal Pulls. I actually found Knee Tucks rather easy, but I could feel sore abs, so I just keep doing the same workout until I start to &#34;feel nothing&#34; about it. So on Day 3, my program is as follows:<br /><br />(Changed) Doing Incline Push Up: 1 set x 40 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br />(Changed) Doing Horizontal Pull Up: 1 set of 30 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br />Doing Shoulderstand Squat: `1 set of 50 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br />Doing Knee Tucks: 1 set of 40 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br />Doing Short Bridge: 1 set of 50 times;<br />Rest for 30 secs;<br /><br />Then repeat the sequence above for three times.<br /><br />Finally, do a Wall Headstands for as long as I could.<br /><br />Paul Wade recommended us to follow all 10 steps slowly, but I found it really too slow. I'm not really impatient, what I worry is that some workout may have no effects on me. I know it doesn't sound very convincing as I'm only on my first week, but I am confident that I can continue the program with enough patience and endurance (I finished the two-month Insanity Workout, which many people would simply give up after two weeks.)<br /><br />I also read You are Your Own Gym by Mark Lauren, it gives more theory about bodyweight training but I found the exercises hard to<br /><br />follow, there were simply too many variations. It's a good reference, but I like Convict Conditioning better, simple, six exercises in ten steps.<br /><br />I actually had some dumbbells at home, but I love a workout without any equipment (or not even video). I define myself as a minimalist, try to carrylesser stuff, calisthenics is perfect for me as I carry my body with me all the time...<br /><br />As for the story about prison, not sure if I should believe it, but hey, if I found the principle of this book useful, I can either read the rest as a fiction or autobiography, it's no difference to me.lesser stuff, calisthenics is perfect for me as I carry my body with me all the time...<br /><br />As for the story about prison, not sure if I should believe it, but hey, if I found the principle of this book useful, I can either read the rest as a fiction or autobiography, it's no difference to me.

B00FFWMI8U|5.0|30 years ago, Hell were about to take off, but never got to record a full-length album before disbanding in 1987. The circulation of the band's demos gained them popularity however, and it was only a matter of time before a reunion happened. Unfortunately, original vocalist Dave Halliday took his own life by carbon monoxide poisoning. However, the man that would help make the reunion possible was a musical student of Dave's and he'd go on to play guitar in another popular metal band, and produce/engineer many albums - Andy Sneap. He's helped out on many memorable metal albums, but he's also a masterful guitarist. If you've never heard his talents as a musician (not just producer/engineer), get ready to have difficulty picking your jaw up off the ground. Ultimately though, the deciding factors on whether you'll be able to handle this music are a couple of minor things. Anyone who enjoys good power metal will certainly enjoy current vocalist Dave Bower's cheesy, yet skillful vocal style. The other being lyrics that revolve around dark themes such as the occult and religion. If you're not into power metal that easily brings to mind Mercyful Fate and King Diamond, then this isn't for you. This is the dawning of the age, the age of nefarious.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game tons of fun! While it is like temple run in my opinion subway surfers is much much better!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book is pretty boring if you are like me who is turning 18 in a year, but who DOES like dictionaries anyways, so I'd give it 4 stars for useful  in English class, but no stars for entertainment.
B009ETEEAU|5.0|Cool gadget it was a gift,<br />Light weight and great price, video is perfect , comes with all attachments and charge cords, needs sd card, would buy another<br /><br />It's a life booster
B00BATG18K|5.0|Another masterpiece! Amy Tan is my favorite author and this book will not disappoint. If you are a fan of her and think her books can start off a bit slow, this one is a little faster from the start. I've been waiting too long to add this one to my collection!
B00FQMZ5M0|4.0|I liked it. I think people are being Pixar snobs or elitest about this movie. Been there seen that.<br />Is it like Cars? Yes.<br />Does it follow the same basic Pixar premise? Yes.<br />But, the animation is top notch and the characters funny and a very positve message that my 7 yr clearly picked up on.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|This Bluetooth headset is a bit of a mixed bag. As far as in game communications go, it's effective but flawed. You need to speak clearly in order to really be heard.<br /><br />The other problem is that the headset isn't adjustable. You basically take a gamble that the product will fit on your ear. I'm not sure that's something that everyone wants to do.<br /><br />For the price, it's hard to argue against this though. If you spend more money, you'll get a better product. But for the price, this headset isn't a bad option. I like it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really liked this book. it keeps you wanting to read more to find out what is going g to happen. I c a my wait to start the next book
B001AQO3XS|5.0|Highlander is a classic movie with a great sound track.  Blueray just makes it that much better. I got it at a price that couldn't be turned down.
B00FMF3R0I|5.0|it is great fun to hear them play music that originated with other  musicians, such as ray charles.  they put their own spin on it which shows what superb musicians they were.  the comments are priceless.  i hope more of these recordings will be released soon.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I had to have this set, I enjoy the old classic movies and Holiday Inn is at the top of the list when the weather gets cold and the holidays start to come around, Excellent movie that they just don't make anymore today. Buy it, watch it and enjoy some old fashion fun.

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is great and really keeps you interested in the plot. Great if your a fan of tap zoo or tiny village.  Try it..
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|What can I say, this is a great film about a shoe company and what becomes of it. We had to see it before we saw the show on broadway, and it was great.

B00GI8AMI8|4.0|Graphics are good.  The puzzles are not to easy, but not so hard that you need hints.  Which is good, because you don't get any.  Worked great, true point and click.  A little short but it was .$.99!  I recommend it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Excellent movie, as this movie could be a classic as it has a twist to it. Not wanting to give it away you should watch it as it makes you think. Great film

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|a very excellent movie, well done, terrific acting;especially Denzel Washington.<br />unbelievable photography.  I recommend it! (don't see it right before you fly somewhere)
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is by far the BEST Solitaire game in my opinion.  Simple and I LOVE it!  I have it on my Kindle and it has helped me pass many hours while &#34;waiting&#34; in places.  Better than a book.  A must for anyone wanting a simple but satisfying game.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Awesome headset, very nice sound quality for the price, comfortable and practical had not used my speakers since i brought this a year ago.
B00CH3QLG0|5.0|Best house music I've heard in years! Amazing album start to finish. These guys collaborated with a lot of different vocalist to turn out  an attention grabbing infectious album that I can't stop listening to! Always puts me in a good mood
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Really, really great app.  I love that i can have it on my tablet and my phone and it will sync. I am feeling much more confident to speak spanish when i need to.
B0046RE5HW|5.0|Delicious mystery/thriller! One of my favourite Agatha Christie novels up there with 'And Then There Were None' and 'Orient Express'...would read again and again.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I bought intrigued by other readers' reviews as I was searching for a good science fiction book after many years I was out of the loop.<br />I liked the story, the creativity and the way is built, the three level scenario at the end of the book with a nice crescendo and sometimes reminded me of asimov's foundation ...but only sometimes. Asimov is still some levels above.
B00GNL96H8|5.0|amazing story of Ip Man. A must watch for all those interested in his life and teachings. They nailed it with this movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Awesome book. Well written. Great stories and a realistic look into the life of a Navy Seal Sniper. Too bad he was killed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly addictive!! Is it the colorful candy pieces? The sweet sound effects? The increasingly difficult puzzles? Or the simple &amp;#34;match 3&amp;#34; gaming? Probably all of the above.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Possibly the best movie to watch on an iPad while sitting in a plane ever made. Is Die Hard with Giant Robots.

B008JFUQZ2|3.0|This was &agrave; fun movie to watch. Nothing fantastic but well worth &agrave; look . Great fun an enjoyable evening
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this trilogy of novels.  Far and above the Twilight series.  People who have this preconceived notion that it's young adult nonsense should give it a whirl.  It's much darker than I'd imagined and found it brave of the author to take the path she did, especially in the final book.  Well done!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I am glad I waited until after hitting 40....it would be a rather depressing movie if I had watched in my 20s!<br />The scene in the bathroom with Words With Friends is TOO Real!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I already reviewed the giraffe but I simply cannot say enough good things about WubbaNub! My son loves to hold the animal and bite on the sides of the Soothie. I always know where his pacifiers are. Worth the $13 or whatever.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Every dog owner will love the book, just because you can actually relate to a lot of the situations presented. It would be better if it wouldn't be so much conflict between the characters. I understand life implies conflict, but sometimes the author portrays it as a constant struggle.  But overall is a well written book that is likely to make you cry :' )
B006YTTVHO|3.0|It's helpful if you aren't the natural conversationalist.  It will help you to get started, and at some point, to be a self-starter

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|You can never go wrong ordering from Amazon. I was using this on my phone for sometime, and I really enjoyed it. When I found I could use it on my Kindle it was a no brainer.  I can be sure you will find it useful as well.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I'm entirely biased as FFDP is one of my favorite bands, but I've enjoyed every single one of these songs! Can you name the last time you bought an album and enjoyed each song?! FFDP has a terrific sound but even better lyrics. &#34;Lift Me Up,&#34; &#34;Watch You Bleed,&#34; &#34;Wrong Side of Heaven,&#34; &#34;M.I.N.E. (End This Way),&#34; &#34;I.M.Sin,&#34; and &#34;Anywhere But Here&#34; are ones I can listen to over and over - and have. Easily one of the best FFPD albums, and one of the best I've ever purchased.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Just finished reading with a box of tissues surrounding me. This is one of those amazing novels that are so rare to find and such a value to the mind and soul. I'm lost for words. Bloody brilliant is what it is.

B003G4W49C|3.0|This is a &#34;good&#34; read.  I'm stingy with stars on books.  This was loaded with introspection and got a little slow in some places, but the story is basically a good sy fy tale.  Read this book many, many years ago, but my son, now 50, a sy fy nut, downloaded it for a second read, and I also read again.  Four stars is usually my top rating on books.  I don't ever expect to experience the 5 star thrill of such books as &#34;The Count of Monte Cristo&#34;, etc.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Much like &#34;Dogma&#34; and &#34;Constantine,&#34; this book looks at the Apocalypse with a lack of reverence and seriousness. And that's such a good thing!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It sucks because its hard to use and needs improvements and i don't think it has longest word in the English language
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|You can never go wrong ordering from Amazon. Specially if they are the free games. You can always try another. They have so many choices. It really can't hurt to try any of them and find what you like.  I love Google search engine and it works great on my Kindle as well.

B004RZGUBM|5.0|I enjoy his characterization and find his social commentary commending. HIs characterization of all minor characters  I find humorous and also filled with pathos. I have only read three of his novels so far, and have enjoyed each one.

0307749606|5.0|I love the Lee Child series with Jack Reacher and have read the book. This is actually a christmas gift for a friend who also likes the Jack Reacher stories, but he's just gone through a cornea transplant and has difficulty reading print. This will be perfect as a gift!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! You've been warned!<br /><br />This review is hard for me, because Divergent is my favorite book of all time now. Tris and Four my new favorite characters. Insurgent was not as great as Divergent, but still held me in the same way, however, Allegiant lost me and took me twice as long to read. It felt so forced and boring; it was disheartening...<br />First off, the perspective switch between Tris and Four...I get why obviously, but I still didn't like it. Tris was a great narrator, and this just threw me off to where I had to keep checking whose voice I was reading in this chapter, which obviously means there was not enough personality in the two characters who have been the strongest personalities all along...<br />Second, because of this new perspective, I was a little let down by Tobias...he went from sexy, tough, and supportive to just plain whiny and indecisive. Yes, a sensitive side is important, but that is not the Tobias we all fell in love with (it seems Four and Tobias are split personalities).<br />Third, Tris progressed so much in the first two books, but then dropped off in the last one. I went from wanting to be her, to thinking she might make a good friend instead...<br />Fourth, the whole story is kind of ridiculous. I mean, I get that there had to be some explanation for outside the fence, but it was basically given the whole &#34;it was all a dream&#34; vibe, which is a big no-no! The idea would have been okay except for the overload of information with all the genetics crap, which is what made it boring.<br />Last, the ending...I don't dislike it for the obvious reason, I am ALL FOR a tragic ending (anything to avoid the BS Hunger Games 'all is wonderful' ending to a trilogy), but it was just done ALL WRONG. She gave her life for someone who did not deserve it for a plan that was SERIOUSLY flawed. Too many holes in this &#34;plot.&#34; LAME.<br /><br />I have a hole in my chest due to the finish of this trilogy, and unfortunately, it is not because of the death of my beloved characters. There seemed to be no point to the story or the characters and it's a shame because Roth had it set up for an exciting, wonderful ending to an amazing series...I hope she finds a way to make it up to her many disappointed fans.<br /><br />End rant.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|\\"The Giver\\" is sensational, when I reached the end I couldn't believe it. For a moment I wished that there was more.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I am not usually a fan of post-apocalyptic type tales, but Steelheart grabbed me at the prologue and never let go. David was my hero from the first word out of his mouth. Just like him, I wanted to see Steelheart bleed. Bring on the next book in this series. I'll be waiting.
0374104093|5.0|This is a strange premise, and an unusual, brilliant novel.<br /><br />Our protagonist is known only as &#34;the Biologist.&#34; She's part of a small female team of similarly titled characters, all part of the latest expedition to Area X. The previous expeditions have all failed in various bizarre, lethal ways, but still expeditions keep going, and people keep volunteering for them.<br /><br />I don't want to say much about what they find in Area X. It'll be better if you read the book. I will say that it's even weirder than the expedition members originally think. And also, though it's a devastating place that it seems like no one ever survives contact with, it's also beautiful and awe-inspiring--something I love seeing in fiction and rarely find. It's never icky or gory or gratuitously cruel.<br /><br />The mysteries of Area X and the twelfth expedition clear up in only the tiniest increments, often while revealing a greater mystery or an additional ambiguity. I found that progress compelling and had trouble putting the book down. I learned a lot about Area X by the end of the book, but nowhere near the full story. This is the first book in a trilogy that will be released quickly, each book just two months after the other in early 2014. This (relatively short) book tells its own complete story, though.<br /><br />I have enjoyed some of Jeff Vandermeer's other books, but found this one a huge improvement. In the past he's sometimes used a strange voice that was hard to get past, but the prose in Annihilation is beautiful and elegant. (Which is good, because with so much weird going on, having to expend effort on ambiguous sentences *also* would be too much.) And sometimes in the past he got too much into the gross and gory for my tastes, but not here. There is, of course, still fungus involved. :)<br /><br />My only hesitation at this point, is wondering what the explanation for all this strangeness will be. I've come across quite a few fictional setups that seem awesome and weird and compelling, but it all falls apart in the end. I hope Vandermeer can pull this off. I think there's a good chance can, especially since the trilogy is already complete. I will update this review once I finish the final book.<br /><br />Overall, very highly recommended. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. I think a lot of people will be talking about this series in 2014.awesome and weird and compelling, but it all falls apart in the end.

B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Good story, well acted, but slow and very depressing.  Made me question if I want to get on a plane again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Well done. Still in tears. Won't soon forget. So very good in so many ways. Thank you, signed A \\"survivor\\"
B00A285OOW|5.0|Great book, with well developed characters.<br />I love Phillipa Gregory's style and her knack for filling in the blanks in history.
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|Unless you are a programmer, this is a toy in the purest sense - very cool, mostly useless, and very fun.  If you like the idea of rolling a remote controled ball around at speeds of up to 6 ft/second (4 miles/hour), you will like this a lot.  Even better, if you are a programmer, it's basically a programmable robot!  If you don't think that sounds like fun, then don't buy Sphero, because that's pretty much what it does.<br /><br />- The biggest fan of this toy is my cat.  When he's bored, he'll bat it off of its charging stand and then look at me until I relent and play with him.  Not all cats will like it - it's not furry or anything, but just a smooth plastic ball about the size of a softball - but my cats love following it around, especially since it can go under dressers and other low surfaces.<br /><br />- I haven't tried out the programming environments, but according to the Sphero webpage, there are two ways to develop programs Sphero, which allows a lot of educational possibilities.  Check out the manufacturer page for more info - it seems like the programming environment is where this really changes from a cool toy into a robot.<br /><br />- If you're not into programming robots, then there are a variety of apps you can use.  The basic remote control app installs on an iOS or Android device, and allows you to control speed, change the light up color, and drive the ball around.  I have the app on my iPhone 4s and my 3rd gen iPad, and it works great.  (OTOH, it won't install on an older iTouch, to my daughter's disappointment.)  The controls aren't completely responsive, but we can get it flying around pretty well.  Other apps let you chase zombies or fight aliens.<br /><br />- Spero does well on solid surfaces, and OK on our plush carpet.  He's waterproof, and you can buy a studded plastic cover to allow him to get extra traction on grass or water (and to keep him clean during outside play).<br /><br />Like I said, if that sounds fun to you, then it will be, and if it doesn't, then it won't.  If you're buying it for someone else (human or pet), make sure you know them well enough to guess.  Recommended for people who have the funds to spend on an RC robot and either want to program or are confident they'll enjoy the toy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a good book. Slow at the beginning but picks up later in the book. All of these books in the series are incredible. Thank you Suzanne Collins for writing these books for all of us to enjoy. I can say other word to describe these books awesome, fantastic, fanominal, just to say a few.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very good read!  A little tedious with trial and legal detail, but very good overall!  I enjoyed this book very much.
B0019O6IWU|2.0|Don't need to think while reading is a common attribute of most self-help books. Just follow exercises and all communication challenges would be solved. Readers are not encourage to critically think.<br />  At the beginning of the book author stated that his technique known to humankind for thousand years. No references were provided. Another place in the book stated that engineers, military personnel can not express emotions. It contradicts with authors idea not to label or diagnose. Huge amount of personal stories distance the book from science.<br />  Assertive communication and CBT are scientifically proven and work for decades.
0385351399|4.0|A good read, entertaining and well written.  However, any insights into the character of the millennial and the slippery slope of the social media malaise is rather shallow.  One suspects that Eggers is, by no means, a digital native.  Rather, he approaches the subject from the point of view of a chagrined neophyte.  Most of the observations and conclusions were probably dated before the book came off the presses.
B008C20TDG|5.0|It's an excellent read and if you follow the plan, you will feel amazing! I followed it because I have arthritis in my back and following this diet reduced the overall inflammation in my body and my back barely hurts anymore. Its been 3 weeks since I started this diet.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a good time waster (and I mean that in the most positive light).  One problem is that I often get the message the game is not responding.  Other than that, it's fine for the doctr's office, etc.
B005544V6A|5.0|Very clever and entertaining show that you may not watch because, you know, &#34;lawyers&#34;. However, this one is great with funny characters, clever overall plot, and great references and one-liners. Love it!
0345803450|5.0|McEwan's books are always sweetly nuanced pleasures to read, if perhaps a bit over-nostalgic for a Generation X American.  Unfortunately, I left this one in my hotel room when I was only halfway through.  However, it did get off to a good start and I'll go out on a limb and recommend it.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|The akinating of this akinator is a-mazing.  It guesses right most of the time, it only bombed on a few instances when I thought of an obscure character and when I did not know answers to most questions.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|The visuals and computer-generate graphics were so realistic you really thought you were there.  I liked that the story focused on the development of his strong moral ethic.  I also like that the storyline in Krypton was more fleshed out with very little in his early and teens years.  We got too much of that from Smallville.
0060007737|5.0|This is an easy read and very interesting if you like marketing/advertising. Had to buy it for a class, but read it in two days because the author is witty and the information is organized well.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|Fun, but it broke already twice -- once on the button, which comes off, and the second on the bottom pen attachment.  Barely fits together.  My other son has another Screwdriver version which is much, much better.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I must prefer to buy all my music from Amazon since the music-files can be played on a multitude of devices, including iPad, iPhone and Android. This download is part of my &#34;Tony Bennett&#34; library which I play when it's time for relaxation and fun time with friends. It's the best of the DUETS album, DUETS II
B00992CF6W|5.0|Look. People only rate it 1 star because there's no updates or it has problems. I downloaded it a couple month ago and guess what, IT WAS UPDATED TO 0.7.5!!!  SO DON'T BE MAD PEOPLE!!! THEY FINNALY UPDATED TO KINDLE!! I rated it 5 stars because it's the best game EVER!!
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|So so so so so pleased with how awesome this set is. It is even cooler than I imagined. THe way the blu rays are cased....super awesome!
B009APMNB0|4.0|My situation is almost identical to JoeD, one of the other reviewers. I'm reviewing this ColorMunki based on past experience with several other DataColor units, and I do pro photo work on a wide-gamut Dell U3011 monitor. I think the summary in a nutshell is that this is the perfect low-cost unit if you own a standard monitor (not wide-gamut, and if you're not familiar with what a wide-gamut monitor is, then perfect, this ColorMunki is for you!).<br /><br />Bottom line is that every monitor needs calibration, even if you aren't a photographer, because monitors are simply not accurate. In the past, calibration was expensive and complicated, but not anymore. This ColorMunki is easy to use, and once you see your monitor calibrated, two things will happen: 1, you'll wonder why you ever waited so long, and 2, you'll bring the thing to work and cal your work monitor too, lol! There is something comforting to the eyes when the colors are correct,<br /><br />I deducted one star because of the quirky software, but I have yet to use a colorimeter that has intuitive bug-free software in the past 7 years, so for me that's just par for the course. However, there is one feature with this unit that is a nice bonus and not often found in inexpensive units, the fact that it handles multiple monitors, and a lot more people use that second monitor now so this is a nice addition.<br /><br />Final word for pro photographers: I contacted X-Rite and they do not recommend this unit for wide-gamut monitors running AdobeRGB colorspace. But for the standard sRGB monitor which most people have, you just can't beat the price, so given that I highly recommend this unit for the majority of users.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Temple Run and Subway Suffers have lots of glitches and issues, but this game does not. This is a wonderful game if you love despicable me
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I'm not one for writing reviews, so I'll keep it simple and to the fact. I'm a big David Bowie fan, and I've heard most of his albums through his different time periods (70's, 80's, 90's, 2000's). You always hear people around hating on his new stuff, reviews saying this album is 'garbage', but the truth be told, this album, like its predecessors Reality and Heathen, exceed and excel his old work.<br />  People are too closed minded, only accepting one form of Bowie. But he's a chameleon. He changes so quickly you can barely have time to notice it. And if you only like one form of him, if you only look at him from one angle, ignoring others because you don't like the way the colors shoot out at you, well, you aren't really looking at him right.<br />  You aren't supposed to compare, you're supposed to appreciate. And no matter what Bowie, new or old, he's still a musical genius. And that's enough said.
0788812408|2.0|Half way in the movie it started to get fuzzy for like 20 minutes for the first half of the movie.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Typical mystery solving game that requires the player find items to progress thru the game. Nice graphics and sound. Fun time consuming game for when you have nothing better to do.
B00B2DGYQS|4.0|It is indeed refreshing to watch a gay movie that doesn't revolve around gay bars and drag queens, but the little white subtitles are hard to read and extremely distracting. I keep having to backtrack to re-read what the actors are saying and that is very annoying!  One would think a movie of this caliber would at lest include decent subtitles.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really loved finding out how Danny T. has been doing after all these years. And it was so thrilling to have read such an awesome sequel that had some scary moments but also a lot of heartfelt, funny yet beautiful moments. I thought the addition of Abra was great and I feel in love with her. I love how Mr. King wrote their inner dialogs and changing physical characteristics  when they were \\"together\\" as one. This book was truly a lot of fun to read and will be given to friends who are his  a few of his  many \\"constant readers\\"' Thank you so much for giving us this well written and much enjoyed update
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I wish it would have never ended, I loved the series. One of my favorite reading experience of all time.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|A great book almost all the way through. The book had me page turning, however, the ending was quite abrupt & disappointing.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I think this is a good game because you could level up_ you could kill and get so you could do dongens
B0071XO8RA|1.0|This book was simply slow and boring with a slightly interesting ending.  Yes, tragic things happened, but once you understood the tenor of the book, you're able to predict almost every event.  I don't know why so many people like this book.  At best it's so-so.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I'm trying to download it and its not working so I don't like it and love subway surf by the way

B00CH87HF4|5.0|Ok so I downloaded the game a month ago and I'm a lvl 30 but my game got reset and I had to buy a new handheld but wen I went to go log into my account it says account not made or something it not letting me wen I type password and email in and it still won't let me(ANTONE KNOW WHAT TO DO PLZ HELP) plz I really like this game?!!!!????!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Beautifully written. Wonderful characters that you need to learn. More about. Lovely lush descriptions of nature Harold comes to love just a nice well written story on many levels.
0812983459|3.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce was cute and a light read but not captivating at all. I give Rachel Joyce credit for not being repeatitive and managing 320 pages of a man walking but it was not as entertaining as what I'm used to reading.<br />The story involves a retired man, Harold Fry, who's former coworker has been suffering cancer. He decides to post a letter but does not stop at the post box. Instead, he decides to walk over 600 miles to see her in person. There is absolutely more to the book and even a few unexpected twists.<br />My biggest shock was that the author did not repeat anything too many times. There is great talent to have enough to write an entire book about a man's journey.<br />I do recommend this book to anyone looking for a light read. This would have been perfect on a plane or cruise. Very easy to read while there are people around. Captivating enough that you don't decide to ditch it but also easy to skip a few sentences and not worry about missing a ton. Enjoyable!
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|the best rap album to come out In 2013 far exceeding all others I wish I could give It 10 stars
B00E9A656K|5.0|Accelerate game, tell you how to accelerate to win the race, and close to the reality. Also, the second stage is a little bit hard.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great companion for the console game. Lots of unlocks that you can only get with this app. Overall great game too.
1416987126|5.0|Our 24 month son loves this book. You've got to read it right, and find the natural lilt of the story, which results in a fun read. My cousin's inlaws read this to their grandkids and turn it into a whole bear hunt activity before going to bed.  Super fun book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love my little pony and this game is no exception its soo Fun I just love it SO much I just wish it was easier to get coins and the elements of harmony! other than that this game is AWESOME I suggest this for any brony out there or just getting it for your kids!! : ) XD Best of wishes<br />  - Pinkie Pie
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Gift for my wife, not yet used this item, seems like I got a good deal on it considering local prices.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a great game. It would be better if you could earn more men. A good way to  pass a wintery day.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|Great movie. It was very interesting  and great for any ghost followers or those who follow the warrens original cases. I only had one problem with it if everything happened as was shown in the movie I think it was very strange case. So I have some doubts about the story as it was shown.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Loving this game.Im finding it more in depth n def making me think 1 step in front.The graphics are really good and nice n clear.The mini games r slightly harder than the norm but again very good.Very good value game n long playing time.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is truly an amazing app. It's easy to pick up. I think it is cool how you can &quot;sea trade&quot; with other friends on Facebook. I love this app!:):):):):):):)!!!!!!!
0765365278|5.0|Best book I've read yet from Brandon Sanderson! Actually, this is probably my favorite fantasy novel. The world is deep and the story is so creative. I can't wait until the next book comes out next year! Buy this book, you will love it!
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Long story short. Story terrible, events unrealistic, Iron Man suddenly feels like a cheap replica made in China, and it feels like story was changed to satisfy Pepper's desires for a bigger role, even if it didn't serve the story best. Also, and since they already brought SHIELD into the story, you see them completely missing when they're needed the most, and shall not allow what's happening. But they don't show up. Why? Because it will cost them more than $10M to bring Samuel Jackson and Scarlett Johanson.<br /><br />The ending made no sense at all, and is just a lame way for them to say it's a wrap. I prefer it to be a normal ending over this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The grandkids love this game.  It is fun and easy to play. It is similar to the game Temple Run. It has a variety of characters for the kids to play as.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Twisted and pretentious. Informative and enthralling. First SK book that I have read - there will definitely be more to come.
B0030P1WKY|4.0|Find your birth date and Whammo!  YOU will be revealed.  It was amazing just how well this book can describe the battles people face just based on their birth date!!!!  Very helpful with regard to identifying issues, just need to find how to address them now!&#62;!?!?!?  Worthwhile if you're having trouble getting your head around where you are at and what it all means.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Meh. It's a way to stream your browser to your TV but dont expect much quality. I bought it to watch GoT on HBOGO but ended up getting a roku3 which I would easily and highly recommend over this device. Google TV doesn't appeal to me.

B00DQC2FPM|4.0|Imagine how excited to finally own my own time machine.  I liked the idea that I could build my new time machine at home without the hassle of having to lease a workspace.  When the time machine pieces arrived, they were much smaller than I expected, but, I still kept the faith.  I turned on the 1985 time travel documentary, upon which this kit was based, and proceeded to build my time machine.<br /><br />The instructions were very easy to follow.  But, I found it very difficult to fit inside the time machine.  Also, there is not a working flux capacitor- a let down for sure, as now I do not know what to do with this plutonium that I bought off some libyan guy in a mall parking lot.<br /><br />If you are expecting to travel in time with this kit, you won't be let down. Upon completion I was transported back to my childhood with Doc and Marty.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|There is no questons that moview with great actors such as Morgan Freeman and Tom Cruise are always well done in terms of acting, theme, story, special effects, and balance with action and dialogue.
B000I62JBE|3.0|I like Robert De Niro in almost any movie.  Probably would not have rated so high if he was not in it.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love this case because there are multiple ways to stand up the Kindle.  Good quality product for a modest price.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed a departure from my normal novel reads. This is quite a concept and seems to me too close to the direction this world is taking. A bit scary.
B001P36OY2|5.0|Lots of action, good dialogue. Vin Diesel is an exellent actor for this type of movies. Obviously if you like this actor
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I think not! Nothing replaces having a plan, sometimes with pictures, and sticking to it, and with modifications as you go. The process presented here is more like &#34;magical thinking.&#34;
B000VZX8J4|5.0|It's Soundgarden. This album is untouchable. There are others that are as good, a few perhaps, but none better. That's it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I am actually reading this book right now - an easy read which I am looking for since I like to read merely for pleasure.  The book is holding my attention and am anxious to see what happens next.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book was entertaining and interesting.  It is different from the Netflix show, as they try to add more conflict and drama on TV.
B00GO95TAC|5.0|Regardless of the price, I intended to purchase 'The Day of the Doctor'. It was amazing and I don't regret spending the $7.99 on it. But I am horrified by how much Amazon is charging for it, it should be priced accordingly to the normal rate of episode prices not so far-fetchingly high. All in all, I was happy to be able to watch it with good quality and no commercials.
B00ANTX3HA|5.0|This film is awesome. There have been three watershed periods in the history of this country since it's birth: the Civil War, WWII and the Kennedy administration. If you are interested in why the country is the way it is, watch this film.

B00GIZO674|5.0|My favorite game ever & great game play!!! So glad I can play it on my kindle instead of just on my PC!!
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Just bought this from Best Buy,<br /><br />First the bad:<br /><br />1. When I first picked it up there was a clicking noise as it moved it. I thought it was the chip ratting around. Turns out the piece that holds the special features disc came off the underside of the Barrel Lid (along with the disc)! Thankfully the disc was not damaged and this is a minor issue - it's possible to just glue it on and no-one will ever know.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />1. The construction is solid. Feels great and has some serious weight to it.<br /><br />2. The packaging for each individual disc blew me away. I did not think they would work on that aspect so well. Each disc is 100% protected from any damage and the holders are magentized! To take out a disc - just pull the casings apart and remove the disc and replace with the magnet! - GREAT and I know my discs will be fine (unlike many other Collections that provide very poor protection for the disc.)<br /><br />3. Looks amazing<br /><br />4. All the episodes are either uncensored or extended or both<br /><br />5. The overall package that the item arrives protects the whole barrel very well.<br /><br />6. Apron and the Chip are well made and not some cheap knockoff thing that most collection sets might include.<br /><br />Time for a Thanksgiving Breaking Bad marathon to begin...
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Loved it!  It's great story telling and has much depth compared to many other movies nowadays.  It's not a love story, but I'd compare it to The Notebook.  I personally love movies that actually tell a story about life, love, history, and overcoming trials.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|This device wowrks very well.  Have been slowly moving all my old cassette tapes to my ipod.  It is very easy to use and works very well.  I am quite pleased with it.  Highly recommend it.  I have also moved some to my lap top and also my iphone.  Works well!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|O'er the last little while, Stephen has dabbled in short stories, essays of intrigue and suspense. It was a pleasure to read a full-length novel again. Abra is the next character in Stephen's more than normal humans championing the cause of protecting the human race from things that go bump in the night.<br /> I look forward to seeing where Abra's strange but strong mind takes Stephen's pen.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I should probably preface this by saying that I am a fan of the Discworld series and own all of the books therein.  I bought this book almost the moment it came out, and was never sorry I did so.  It's not the best of the series, but it certainly has a lot to offer.<br /><br />Sir Samuel Vimes is strong-armed by his wife and Vetinari into taking a family vacation.  He, Young Sam, and Sybil head to Sybil's childhood home/mansion out in the country.  The house is situated near a town that is very unlike Ankh-Morpork.  It's one of those tiny places that has one of anything: one policeman, one pub, etc.  It also has all the usual characters you can expect to find in that sort of place . . . and a nearby nest of goblins.<br /><br />Goblins are one of the few remaining intelligent species on the Disc that every other species not only despises, but things of as animals.  Goblins can be slaughtered, sold into slavery, etc., without any sort of repercussions.  Except that Samuel Vimes (and the Summoning Dark residing in his head) are not about to let it go when a goblin girl is murdered.<br /><br />Snuff takes a while to really get going, unfortunately.  I had a hard time getting into the first couple of chapters.  But once the book got going, it really got going.  I was completely absorbed and unable to put it down.  The villains were suitably villainous and a real threat to our protagonists.  The climax was intense, had surprising moments, and was worth waiting for.  Pratchett's usual social messages were present but didn't feel like they bashed you over the head.  His characterizations were good -- including, I'm glad to say, his characterizations of women, which are usually one of his weak points.<br /><br />I'd probably overall gives this book 4.5 stars if that was an option, because of the slow beginning, but I am by no means ashamed of giving it the full five.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Excellent premise with deep messages of planetary conservation, love even among machines, betrayal, abuse of power, and the need for vigilance in preserving humanity. Very well done.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read The Shining before the movie, but I picture the actors while reading Doctor Sleep.  I absolutely love how my anticipated questions were answered.  Stephen King is my hero, his analogies of dying and death are what will carry me through.  Thank you for another captivating novel Mr. King.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The best version of this show ever, and put on DVD so you can revisit it whenever you like.  Ramin Karimloo is astonishing, but the others are similarly stellar.
006074748X|4.0|Vanessa is approached by Tim's mother, who requests that she escort the seventeen-year-old boy to Austria where, she says, Vanessa's husband is . . . except that her husband is meant to be in another country.  Tim's mother explains that she saw video footage of Vanessa's husband in Austria, and Vanessa is convinced when she sees the footage herself.<br /><br />Once Vanessa agrees to escort Tim -- who turns out to be quite self-reliant, intelligent, and helpful -- they set out to find Vanessa's husband.  They soon find themselves embroiled in a mysterious plot centered on a circus, horses, and various mysterious individuals.<br /><br />The book is, to start with, not in the least what I expected from the first few chapters.  That isn't to say it wasn't enjoyable: it was.  It was a fairly solid entry into the genre.  True, it was a bit odd that every good guy character got along with every other, and the plot progression was less gripping than it might have been, but I still read the whole thing (trust me, I *will* stop if I don't like a book) and was glad I did so.  There is just enough humor to lighten the tension, plenty of interesting and personality-filled characters, and a definite mystery.  The book also has good setting and atmosphere, giving the reader a tourist-eye view into the various locales.<br /><br />All in all, although I wouldn't press the book into peoples' hands and demand they read it, I would say that the book is definitely a decent way to pass a Sunday afternoon.
B00AHDXTIK|3.0|Does not work with both of my Apple devices, and I had to go out and buy another Apple Lightening cable, so that it would work with the device that this was intended for.
B00GHJ77KO|5.0|i thought that the song was great, a great beat(sound) and the ong has great lyrics I would honestly reccomend this song!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played. One thing I think they should change is the bosses difficulty. Especially Vector. He was so hard. It took me like, 15 try's to beat him. Other than that it's great.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is a story of ideas (much different from the movie, which tried to turn it into an action adventure).  The characters seem very human to me with their nobility and flaws.  The horrible aspect is that the soldiers are such young children who are ruthlessly used by adults who believe their reasons are valid.  There is a lot of material for thought.  Orson Scott Card includes a foreword in this edition which was apparently not in the original book.  It adds an interesting dimension of understanding to the book.  It's well worth reading.  I can't say the same for the movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the book. Plain and simple. It is easy to read, yet it is a book you can read over and over again with something new discovered every time.
B001AFF25W|5.0|This review first appeared on  [...] --- my blog<br />  Well, let me ask you this question, For how many times in your life were you swamped by a feeling “ Oops,  where did the day go?.  I wanted to do so much  !!!  but the time just flew.  We all plan to do many things, we complete some and grow aversive towards the rest. Somehow something (low/high priority) props up in the middle and we end up losing the race.  The other thing is procrastination; we always have our reasons for not doing the right things at the right time.  Procrastination, in essence is the king when it comes to self sabotage.<br /><br />  Improper priorities and procrastination are the  two big things that haunt the performance of most of us today , I am  no exception.  However, if I am handling things better than before, it’s because of the tips I read and am implementing from a book called “Eat that frog”.<br /><br />  Written by the self-made millionaire Brian Tracy, Eat that frog comes up with 21 principles for setting the priorities right and handling the procrastination.  Written in simple English this 100 page book gives some very useful and very easy to practice tips to improve our efficiency at work. I am not telling this for the sake of the review, but the 3-4 hours you spend reading this book will change your perspective on your daily regular tasks .  The book is available on skill port/Amazon,  do read it, and I am sure you’ll refer it to others.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mon because she is difficult to buy for.  This is one of her favorite movies, but it was so expensive in the stores.  The price I paid was excellent, the movie arrived in perfect condition & in time for the holidays!  Will use this seller again.
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this game. The robots in this game have some awesome moves! Tag team mode is the best. Free sparing mode is so fun, you can play as any robot you want!

B007IXGUG0|5.0|I admit that I used to consider Drake girly rap but that's not the case. I gave him a chance & I wasn't let down. I love this album & I listen to it on the regular, especially if there are girls present ;)
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME.......Did I say I love this game, well I do. There is a few things that I do not like but can live with. First thing is that you need crowns for a few important things. Second is items not all but a few are way over priced. Third the time it takes to craft things take way to long to wait out.<br /><br />Great things, one, the type of items are realistic to that fictitious day and era. Secondly the story is a good one. Thirdly the graphics are great and cute. They even have a patch that made it winter with snow and the theme is Christmas. Fourth you can rearrange your village any way you want. I could go on and on but this should give you a pretty good indication and also despite the first paragraph the game is still great.
B000002J1M|5.0|I loved this one from the first time I heard it on Philly FM station WMMR I went out and bought it. This has held up well over the years what a great opening Watcher Of The Skies the whole album is great but one of the best songs ever is the epic Supper's Ready what a simply wonderful song it soothly flows through each section to end in a most wonderful way. The band is so tight on this one this the orignal band when all of the members were still in the group. A great release.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Downloaded it on my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX and I love it. It is huge. comes in handy. Very easy to download, not expensive and used often.
B000VZKMSO|5.0|I am not a big fan of early Kanye but this is a really good album. The only song that I skip is &#34;Stronger&#34; because I am not a fan of radio.
B00GSE92F6|5.0|SPOILERS.<br /><br />Loved the Doctors bickering,  Pointing out each others differences They even have 12's eyes make a guest appearance oh and of course Tom Baker and Matt Smith at the end. Hurt regenerating. Wonderful!
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Flight could have toned down the f___ word but it was an important story about integrity and self-delusion. Great flight scenes!.
1455508691|5.0|Who doesn't love Ellen.  I love reading her books. She is great, funny. Never disappointed in her books. Especially like it on my Kindle.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|What can I say other than I was pleasantly surprised after listening to this album. I always liked J. Cole but sometimes his music can be monotonous but this album is different. The beats are hot, Cole stepped up his lyrical game & out came this gem. Highly recommended!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved this book and I loved the characters. Written from a unique point of view that allows readers a birds eye perspective. I almost didn't give it a chance though because the cover photo makes it look like a cheesy sex book. In reality it is a smart, fun, witty and erotic rump.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|The plot was not believable.  I know science fiction movies are usually pretty far-fetched but usually the writers find a way to make the plot remotely plausable.  I could never &#34;suspend disbelief&#34; with this one.<br /><br />The acting was also corny and overly dramatic.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great family movie for all ages.  The animation, sound and story were fabulous. The &#34;Believe&#34; theme is perfect for the season.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I would recommend this book to people young and old. It's neat that my kindle has a mobile dictionary. I love it.
1401242855|5.0|first off, every man or child should have a collectible. The Court of Owls storyline in the new Batman 52 series was a great way to kick off the introductory villian. This is a must read! a must have! Wear the mask to sleep, maybe Talon will spare you after all. Great buy!!!!!!
B000B589JI|1.0|Yep, the other reviews are right it leaks. I'll have to figure out a way to solve this problem. Will try to add washer.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed Sycamore Row. It was a lot like The Testament in that it showed the greed of families when there is a lot of money to be had, even when it is not deserved or earned. John Grisham again weaves a tale of families, honor and enjoyable courtroom drama!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It is fun when you are bored  i like emoji a lot and anyone who likes emoji should get this game
B00ECL7ZCY|5.0|I don't buy music very often anymore because I can pay $10 a month for Spotify and listen to music until I get tired and move on.  Haim was my first purchase in a very very long time.  In fact, I love them so much that I dished out $25 to get 'Days Are Gone' on vinyl just so that I can hear every nuance.  My only gripe is that it's split onto two records which means that my lazy ass has to get up and flip sides every 3 songs.  Still love it though.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Day of the Doctor makes so much more sense after viewing this.  Plus Paul Mc<br />Gann!  Who doesn't love the eighth doctor!
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I liked this movie quite a lot.  There is a lot of criticism on Jaden Smith, but I think honestly it's just in comparison to his father, which is unfair.  I've seen him in other roles, and I thought him improved over them.  The special effects were great, the story line was fairly straightforward and interesting.<br /><br />A good watch.  The message it gives, to live in the now and not in fear, was obscure but good.  It's a little scary for pre-teens, which is disappointing as that is really who I think the message and movie woudl benefit the most.  it may not really be violent enough to
B00G4I11YQ|4.0|Very informative film. I had no idea they treated animals that way and lied about people's deaths. I hoped sea world would allow themselves to be interviewed for this film , but they didn't. Always two sides to a story
B00AQN09VQ|5.0|Great price great product. Would recommend to any Big Bang fan.  Happy thanksgiving, merry Xmas and happy happy new year.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|You just plug it into your device, and stream things over wireless from your phone or any computer. So totally awesome!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Loved the history that came with the story, and the connections between the different characters. I also like how the story was connected to actual events in American history.
B00G21XNKU|4.0|It should be 5 stars...but the price of the &#34;Day of the Doctor&#34; episode was absolutely ridiculous. I mean, $6.99 for a single episode? Seriously?<br /><br />Anyway, the episode was pure magic and brilliance and funny and all the rest we've come to expect from the doctor. There were of course some lovely surprises along the way as well, but they're spoilers so I won't say. Suffice it to say that seeing Matt Smith and David Tennant and John Hurt be doctors together was just so much fun that I have a hard time coming up with the words. There are lots of little moments and looks they give each other that make any Doctor Who fanboy bubble over with joy.
B00CDTSFF8|2.0|Seriously lacking in quality when compared to Game of Thrones.  Disappointed in the plot.  The whole story was just not believable at any point.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This is a compact and light flash. It delivers beautiful illumination and color and provides great skin tones. Easy to use and it has good battery life
B0014VQGX4|5.0|i got this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. looking at it the toy is well built and i'm sure he will have plenty of fun with it
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great read that takes you back to life in the late 50s/early 60's. While the story slows a bit in the middle, King does a great job building suspense towards the story's climax, and throwing in an ending I did not see coming.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Just crazy about this show.  Did not expect to be so caught up in the characters and story line.  Wish that we could get our hands on season two faster!  We recommend this to everyone.  And this is coming from someone who does not like anything to do with fighting and mideival stuff at all!!!!  The man who plays the very short brother is absolutely wonderful . . . our favorite charactera bar none.
B00B2QA646|2.0|I deeply respect the attempt of the director in this drama/ theatrical direction, but looks really twisted interpretation of such a classic novel, no such a loss if you miss seen it
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|watched in the theatre and couldnt wait for it on blu ray.I love it! One of the best since the exorcist!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wish i could give 0 stars. Extremely disappointing. I feel like the entire trilogy was now a waste of my time with the conclusion of this book. Poorly written and left me unsatisfied. If the author's point was to leave her readers angry, she succeeded with me.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|Despite the gargantuan success of \\"The Wall\\", Pink Floyd was pretty much finished as a working band. Richard Wright, fired during the sessions of \\"The Wall\\", only to temporarily return as a salaried session musician for the accompanying tour, was gone; Nick Mason was reduced to an even lesser substantial role as a drummer; and the relationship between Roger Waters and David Gilmour completely disintegrated, subsequently leading to a court battle that would dampen their friendships for nearly two decades before their reunion at \\"Live 8\\". Before this dissolution, they made one more album, an album disregarded as a Roger Waters solo record, yet still possessing the same aural trademarks that defined a Pink Floyd album. And a very good one too, despite its faults.<br /><br />Contrary to popular belief, \\"The Final Cut\\" is not a sequel to \\"The Wall\\", even though it was originally planned as a soundtrack album to the film adaptation of \\"The Wall\\" and even featured some of the tracks that were left over from that two-disc monolith. Instead, with his disgust towards the Falklands War and his utter hatred towards nationalistic leaders who obtain military and societal superiority at the expense of human life, Roger Waters turned it into an antiwar document - a \\"requiem for the postwar dream\\" as it says in the back of the album. As a result, \\"The Final Cut\\", like many other Pink Floyd albums, is a concept album, one that could stand on its own.<br /><br />\\"The Final Cut\\" is unlike anything Pink Floyd has done before, even compared to \\"The Wall\\". The electronic inventiveness and strong psychedelic melodies of their previous records were all gone; no inventive art-rock epic to showcase the band's instrumental abilities; and the surefire singles that made \\"The Wall\\" a huge hit were nowhere to be found. In their place was a hugely subdued, lower-key and brooding music that recalls the downbeat introspection of Nick Drake. Michael Kamen's rich, emotionally charged orchestration had replaced the lush, immaculately detailed productions that made \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and even \\"Animals\\" invigorating listens. Richard Wright's melodic keyboards and synthesizers were replaced by Michael Kamen's somber piano chords and Andy Bown's spooky Hammond organ. Even David Gilmour's duties as a guitar player were reduced, offering nothing more than a series of enticing guitar solos that sporadically appear here and there. In fact, Gilmour only sings one song and that's nearly at the end of the album. Listening to \\"The Final Cut\\", one could be fooled into thinking this is not a Pink Floyd album.<br /><br />And yet despite these musical changes, \\"The Final Cut\\" still possesses the same signature motifs that defined Pink Floyd's music in the seventies. There's the monolithic menace of \\"Animals\\", the emotional nakedness of \\"The Wall\\", the wistful sadness of \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and the philosophical lyricism of \\"Dark Side\\". An anti-authoritarian undercurrent, traced in all Pink Floyd albums between \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"The Wall\\", was still visible in \\"Final Cut\\", moreso than ever. The album still flows from track to another, making each essential listening. Most of all, the themes of alienation, conflict, mental illness, corruption, the denigration of war and emotional repression, central in \\"The Dark Side\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"The Wall\\" have been pushed to the forefront, where now the words would garner greater attention than the music. There is no doubt this is a Roger Waters record, but one that still bares the hallmarks of all Pink Floyd records that came beforehand.<br /><br />\\"The Final Cut\\" gets to a rousing start with \\"The Post War Dream\\", a melancholic piece that slowly builds into a powerful release with Waters' asking Margaret Thatcher, \\"What did we do?\\". The guitar work is only there for about thirty seconds, but it makes a huge impression. \\"Your Possible Pasts\\", a leftover track from \\"The Wall\\" and the only one that sounds closest to a Pink Floyd song, harmoniously alternates between a soft dynamic in the verses and a louder dynamic in the rollicking chorus, before Gilmour provides an electrifying guitar solo that makes this a lost classic. \\"One of the Few\\", another leftover song from \\"The Wall\\" allows Waters to showcase his talents on the acoustic guitar.<br /><br />The next track ranks as one of the album's best songs: \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" was released as a promotional single for the film adaptation of \\"The Wall\\", but failed due to its somber nature. Although it was re-released on the Pink Floyd compilation \\"Echoes\\", it was firmly put in \\"The Final Cut\\" in a 2004 reissue (where it's been ever since), making it integral to the album's central themes. And indeed, it actually fits the album's narrative very nicely. Composed entirely with Michael Kamen's grievous orchestration, Waters provides one of his finest vocal performances as he agonizes the death of his father during WWII.<br /><br />After the forgettable \\"Hero's Return\\", \\"The Final Cut\\" reaches another peak with \\"The Gunner's Dream\\", an intense, heartbreaking piano ballad about a gunner envisioning a utopia without violence, death and maniacs blowing holes on both sides of the tracks. Despite his deficiencies as a singer, Waters brings emotional intensity to a poetic elegy that would have been rendered moralistic and hackneyed by a lesser frontman with smaller passions. The first side concludes with \\"Paranoid Eyes\\", a shimmering ballad about a soldier lost in a \\"haze of alcohol soft middle age\\".<br /><br />The second side, however, begins with two of the worst songs on \\"The Final Cut\\": \\"Get Your Filty Hands Off My Desert\\", showing Waters' anger at invasion and war, impressively begins with the roar of an aircraft dropping bombs on a desert, but descends into a hokey folk piece played with a ponderous orchestration. \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\", however, showcases the worst of \\"The Final Cut\\": an emotionally overwrought, melodramatic and depressingly simplistic expression of rage, in which Waters expresses a vision of putting tyrannical and colonial leaders into a mental asylum and applying the final solution on them. The crude songwriting on this song is disappointing coming from Waters, an indispensable songwriter not known for his lack of sophistication. The song's only saving grace is the excellent guitar solo by Gilmour. Bizarrely, \\"Fletcher\\" is the only song from \\"Final Cut\\" that has appeared on compilations \\"Echoes\\" and \\"A Foot in the Door\\", instead of superior tracks like \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" or \\"The Gunner's Dream\\"<br /><br />The album gets back on track with \\"Southampton Dock\\", a delicate folk song that could have come out of \\"Pink Moon\\", but whose despairing outlook on seeing soldiers leave to fight a war is vintage Pink Floyd. The title track, another rejected song from \\"The Wall\\", is as close to a love song Waters has conceived. More than most other songs by Pink Floyd, it comes closest in revealing the writer's intimacies. Naturally, this isn't a feel-good power ballad, but a reflective portrait of an individual suffering from sexual repression before attempting a failed suicide.<br /><br />The quietness of \\"Southampton Dock\\" and the title track make the blazing hard rock of \\"Not Now John\\" an unexpected surprise. It's also an unexpected delight, the only song on \\"The Final Cut\\" to feature a lead vocal by Gilmour and the only one with a subversive sense of humor. The song satirizes the cutthroat competition between post-war America, Europe and Japan as each of these countries endanger the lives of their soldiers for a good game. Waters' mimicking of sound effects (can't stop lose job mind gone silicon what bomb get away pay day make hay...) should dispel any doubts that Waters has a funny bone in his body. The final song, \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\", brings the album to an appropriate finale, although after the high drama of the title track and the hard rock of \\"Not Now John\\", it sounds like an afterthought.<br /><br />\\"The Final Cut\\", like \\"The Wall\\", came out to strong mixed reviews. Unlike \\"The Wall\\", however, it had no staying power, selling a piddling 3 million copies (a number acceptable to anyone not Pink Floyd). Listeners were taken back by the album's austere, introspective material and rock journalists panned Waters for making what they felt was an emotionally overwrought mess of a record completely devoid of melodies (although the best of \\"The Final Cut\\" has a personal quality lacking in some of these dunderhead critics' favorite artists). Everyone involved, even Waters, has expressed regret making the album and you are unlikely to hear \\"Not Now John\\" or \\"Your Possible Pasts\\" played on rock radios today or in the future.<br /><br />But like the greatest of all Pink Floyd records, \\"The Final Cut\\" has not dated, but grown relevant through the decades. Its blunt antiwar messages, anger at the establishments and intensely personal songwriting seems more prophetic today than back in '83. With the failures of the United States government under the Bushes and the Obama administration to regard human life with prosperity and kindness, with the public debating on the merits of the Gulf War and the War in Iraq, and the rise of disillusionment in the global economy, \\"The Final Cut\\" could have been made today and still seem modern. By comparison, after Waters' departure, Gilmour and Mason brought back Richard Wright, several session musicians and a bunch of professional songwriters to make \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\", a generic, uninspired relic that sounded less like Pink Floyd and more like the dated pop-rock acts of the 1980s.<br /><br />\\"The Final Cut\\" is not one of Pink Floyd's greatest moments - the emphasis on anger, lyrics and sonic textures; the inaccessible nature of the record; and several filler tracks make this a tough listen for music fans. But the best of \\"The Final Cut\\" makes this a worthwhile experience, for anyone willing to submit themselves to such a flawed yet bold and ambitious vision and hear the sentiments of a man trying to come to terms to what is wrong with this world.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.t, melodramatic and depressingly simplistic expression of rage, in which Waters expresses a vision of putting tyrannical and colonial leaders into a mental asylum and applying the final solution on them.

1476727651|4.0|I was very excited to read the sequel to The Shining, though it's not my favorite King novel, it cannot be denied it is a classic. Getting to see what happened to the survivors of the Overlook Hotel was a treat, especially Danny (Dan) Torrance. Dan has grown up & no surprise his \\"shining\\" has not made his adult life any better than his tormented childhood. We also me Abra Stone, who like Dan is a child with so much power that she gets on the radar of a group of travellers called the True Knot. Ruthless people who live forever feeding off the \\"steam\\" that children with the shining release as they are tortured & murdered.<br />You don't have to have read The Shining, there's enough explanation in the book & it really is mostly about the new story & not the past. I would always read the first book before a sequel but I think this is one of the rare kind that could stand on its own.<br />Definitely an good read both as a sequel & a stand alone novel. As usual King weaves a fantastic tale that I stay up with late into the night, telling myself just one more chapter.
0142405809|5.0|This is a wonderful story like Room on the Broom or Tiddler. It's a real joy to read aloud to an eager little listener and the pictures are gorgeous.

B005723JSQ|5.0|In an age where the mobile phone, texts and emails dominate our communications, Sophie Kinsella has thrown two unlikely to meet people into each other's lives.<br /><br />Poppy Wyatt and Sam Roxton have a unique meet-cute moment.  But what develops between them is a fragile arrangement. She's a lot of insecure XXX's & OOO's.  He's terse, brusk and to the point.  She meddles in his business and personal life, while he is equal parts irritated and amused by her.  Over the course of a very short time, their interactions become a lifeline, through their texts, that neither knew they needed.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the footnotes as they develop both the humor and emotions of Poppy's thoughts.<br /><br />I really wanted to the book to continue when it ended.  Suffice to say, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book.  Which I was fortunate to get, according to the Kindle reviews.  And believe me when I say, I &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 my Kindle!<br /><br />If you are looking for a cute, HEA kind of book, then search no further.<br /><br />1. It should be noted that Kinsella's novels are about funny, quirky ladies.  Each is unique and has a voice different from the others.  Suggesting that all her characters are the same is ridiculous.<br /><br />2. Footnotes by DB
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Pretty good story, whoever doesn't like this is just nit picking. Yes there are similarities to other great stories and plots, but once you start reading you won't be able to put it down, besides, the book was free, can't beat that.
B003B02O0A|5.0|From the very beginning this book kept me on edge. It is a reminder of where we came from and where we are now, in the end we are all just people.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I really enjoy this album. Aside from a few songs, everyone of the others are fantastic. Really an improvement over his previous few albums in my opinion. Highly recommend to any Eminem fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|get this game I like temple run but this is even better I will give u 5reasons to get this app<br />1.) it is free<br />2.) u can delete it if u dont like it<br />3.) it is rated 4 and a1/2 stars<br />4.) it is special for kindle fire<br />5.) it is new and improved version of temple run
B009NF54ZE|5.0|its about time they made a game that could keep your interest.<br />it is a refreshing change.<br />I like all the different games within a game.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I so love this game!  I was a bit skeptical before I downloaded the game.  I though maybe the game wouldn't be very good on the Kindle since the screen is so small (comparatively).  Boy was I wrong!  And happy to be wrong.  The graphics are really great.  The game play is a lot of fun.  Seems like even though you have to wait for crops to grow and recipes to finish, there's always something else to do.  The other thing I really like is that while you can spend real money to get game coins and &quot;crowns&quot; that you can use to buy stuff and advance the game more quickly, you don't HAVE to buy them to fully enjoy the game.  Bravo, Zynga!  I'm one happy gamer!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game!!!! Love the stage changes and music. Wanna play it like everyday now. Should allow manual stage changes for more fun.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Is it perfect?  No.  But it explores themes we need to examine.  Connection, community, the attack on privacy, the growth of monster companies, brainwashing, our removal from solitude and personal time for reflection, identity, desensitization to the loss of our freedoms by those (even ourselves) who justify our tech tools as convenient and helpful.  Any tool someone developed for the greater good can be perverted for the negative or nefarious. Everything in the world is rated, measured, which is how I see a lot going - we are plumbed for \\"market research\\" (I'm reviewing this book!).  Big business and government form partnerships that wield way too much power.  If you've lived in a time before technology infiltrated almost every nook and cranny of our lives, you know where and how it begins.  This book pushes it along to a possible future (although some of the ideas aren't far-fetched).  Eggers did a good job projecting the present into the near-future.<br /><br />My quibbles: No one would possibly have had the time to do everything they're asking the protagonist to do in a day - she has so much more to do, but no more time to do it.  As others have said, the lead character's weak, a little naive, and a little cardboard.  I wanted to know what happened to the couple by the boat rental place (I think they stood for something important), but they vanished. The book really didn't need the sex - seems the author only threw that in to illustrate a point, but it would have been just fine and able to be read by a wider, younger audience (who could really use a novel like this) without it.  And I really would have liked a victory...but I guess that's not the point.  This book made me think about the way the wind's blowing, what our techno-gods hath wrought, and where it might end up if we're not careful.<br /><br />I'm glad I read it.  It covered ideas I'd been thinking about for the past few years, and placed them into a framework for how things might play out.  As a toolto reflect on society, you could do worse than read this book. It causes you to think more deeply about your online life - what we accept and what we give up by accepting it (did for me, anyway).  It was my first Eggers novel; I plan to read more.  And do you think this might be turned into a movie?  I'm thinking so.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It's always a great book when you get so emotionally attached to the characters. It's basically based on the holocaust so you know it's a sad book but the way it was narrated was unique. If you read it, you won't be disappointed.
B005PK56TA|2.0|It's nothing to write home about. Ok Movie, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at a theater.
B00687PWQG|4.0|this was a very good and educational film about one of our most important founding fathers. Everyone remembers Washington and Jefferson, but few remember Adams who was one of the driving forces behind our independence from England
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Horrible movie, all the actors from the first one are missing in this one.  The cast is weak, the acting is bad, the story is predictable and pathetic.  Probably should have asked for my money back after the first 10 minutes, but thought I should give it a try.  One of the worst decisions of my life.
B004UPANAI|3.0|would sparks fly off of indestructable steel? maybe i guess<br />im a marvel fan, but this movie got hte shaft in my opinion. special effects sucked, but i would imagine since it got leaked before it hit theaters, and before the special effects were complete the studio got the effects budget chopped. something about it just didnt have the marvel sheen to it. the newest wolverine movie makes up for it.
075666733X|5.0|This is a great book for the basic information into the human body.  It comes with a CD- ROM which i have not tried but looking forward too.  It is a great study tool and reference guide, for learning anatomy. I would recommend this book to medical students, and also people with interest in anatomy, and body functions.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game would be a lot better if it was not limited on how many times you play and not having to buy all the extras you should be able to have the choice to have free time or pay
B003L77G8I|5.0|great show. why do we have to type to much just to say great show. I do like her books better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|holy cow! I cannot express how absolutely happy/excited I am that this game is now available for my kindle! I'm like a fat kid in a candy store!!  I have been waiting so long for this and gave up looking for it in this market for a while now, and just got the urge to just &quot;check and see&quot; and its here and its the actual game. Not some cheap knock off!! YIPPEE!!
B001MW0J2Y|4.0|Highly original and beautiful. Central is the standout track on this record. John pours out his soul on this and you can hear it in every note.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|its super fun and its funny!you should totally get this game plus its free!!!I give it five stars so BOO YAA
B00005JMYI|4.0|complete farce, wanted to see it before I go  to see Anchorman II.  Set in 70's, clothes outrageous, as is the entire story.
B0088XXCZ6|3.0|Don't listen to it much, don't like it as much as some of Fiona's other albums.  I do however, love Fiona.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is an awesome game I play it everyday. How do I update it to open more puzzles? Hope to see more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm 30 and my daughter is 6 and she is better than me at this game! Fun for all ages... great way to pass the time...
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie?  It was a great value since it included all the different options for a low price.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Wheeeeeee! What a wild ride.  I did not watch this when it started on television.  Now it is so suspenseful I have to wait until I have 3-4 shows to watch the cliff hangers are awesome.  This let me catch up to everyone else.  it was great to have the entire seson at my fingertips because as I said the cliffhangers are something!

B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Like all of Gladwell's books (and I've read them all) he does an excellent job of providing data to support some great take aways I can use in business and life.  Truthfully maybe a bit &#34;drier&#34; than others as a complete work, but surgically criticized, parts are masterpieces.
0871164566|5.0|Worth the price.  This book kept me interested.  it is well organized, well written with clear directions that include some pictures.  I don't think this is ab ook for a novice wire worker.  You have to have some understanding and basic skills first.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|I like it but every time I want to take a pic the camera will turn upside down... and the pic shows up upside down! It soooo annoying but it is really cool u can put pics on top of one another and stickers and effect and I recommend u buy it. DIS IS just on kindle fire HD so it might work on other devices but my camera might just be messed up so why don't ya try it for it self while I figure out what in the name of pie is going on wit my cooky camera!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I downloaded mob of the dead trailer and I went to downloaded and there was nothing there this thing sucks take it off the store
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Cute fun game that can be played quite easy on a tablet.  Will be playing it for sometime. Hope others enjoy it also
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|The first and current third are better. But it was good to watch between seasons.  I did not woatch it when it first started.  I liked being able to catch up.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Good &quot;condensed&quot; version of Castleville. :-) Same pretty music and some familiar characters, too. Like that the ship links to others on a quest.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Duolingo is a great app for learning a new language. It is fun and interactive. The repetition helps you to memorize words and phrases quickly.
B000W8HC8I|4.0|The story of an unbelievable lifestyle. Every vice you can imagine, and nothing in moderation. Adult in nature and language.
1616550414|5.0|Awesome book. I love what they did with this to give a clear history for Zelda. But I ended up giving my to a little girl in the program that I work for who loves Zelda a lot so I have a good memory with this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is one of the most craziest, hardest, fun, suspenseful games I have ever played, not to mention one of  the best apps. Anyone who hasn't played this game soul should give it a try. It is also very addictive and intense. :)
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This Game is awesome and I'll spill the details this game has great graphics easy medium and hard challenges Realistic Looking Levels AND Online Multiplayer the developers of this game are pro and you should get this game. Remember share this game to your friends and subscribe to my YouTube Stoicworm80. Game on gamers.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is well done, very difficult (some stages) and very entertained.  I really recommend it. Ojce you try it, you feel the need to continue...
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Nicholas Sparks' stories are always good and gentle stories.  totally enjoyable and nice characters.....the page turner intrigue was not there, but the ending  was, or am I getting this one mixed up with the one where his wife was her good friend????  They are maybe too much alike.
B004SBULWE|5.0|HELPS ME SAVE MY BATTERY... A LOT!! When I have programs running in the background, task killer hats rid of them!!!!
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson made it worthwhile to finally finish this series. The ending (which I understand was Robert Jordan's) was awesome.
B00GINENG0|5.0|It's fun seeing Tom grow I like have fun with many of u people should get this game please get it follow me ya
B000BJ7BCU|4.0|I love this movie
1250038820|5.0|A perfect combination of great photography and collective Human wisdom .. once you're done with Humans Of New York you might find yourself wanting to strike a conversation with a complete stranger!, dont hesitate doing it.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|fun. good graphics. time sucker for sure. I was really surprised by how the graphics and sound sounded on my kindle fire HD. I don't know if I would put this on my phone.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|If you like traditional Country Music from the '60s and '70s, you'll love Vince Gill's<br />vocals and Fender Telecaster, and Paul<br />Franklin's pedal steel offerings on<br />&#34;Bakersfield&#34;!
B00GD9F59S|5.0|What a great ending to a series filled with magic, cunning one liners, fantastic characters, a few snarky Greek gods and a heroine so powerful she ties it all together.  Sentinel will leave you cheering, sighing and reveling in the magic that Armentrout created in this series and I hope for all the little daimon babies out there we see more of these characters in the future.  Be it short stories, extra sneak peaks, whatever I'm not picky ;-)
B003K15IF8|4.0|I found this to be a gloomy timeless story that could apply to just about anyone, anywhere, in any time period and thus one that just about anyone can relate to at some level.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|The movie is great. It really gives you a quick overview of Temple Grandin's life and how she had a mother that pushed her to live in whole different world than what Temple knew. It helped me understand much better what autism is all about.
B00EVW013E|4.0|My type of movie!! Action packed, good looking guys, a few intense moments, not realistic but most movies are not. ut Oh, and not for whole family.. (10 on up for boys in my family) ENJOY
B00B5HQL50|5.0|The only bad part I could see was the death of M. But that is the life of Bond. Moneypenny is finally brought in, which is getting back to the bond I'm sure we all remember.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I think some of the reviewers were way too harsh in their assessment of this book.  The story was quite absorbing, especially in the last half of the book, and the feel of being in France was strong.  Contrary to other reviewers, I felt that the character development was very good.  I wish I could have given it 3 and one half, because I thought it was better than just okay, but 4 stars seems a little high.  The only negative criticism I would give is that, at times, I had to retread because things seemed a little muddled, and it was a little slow in the beginning.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|Amazing album.  Love Five Finger Death Punch!  My son also loves their music.  Just received the new cd and dvd
0307960471|3.0|Jo Nesbo is an Economist, a great author, has a successful bank and is good looking.  Is that too much?  I do love his books.  This is not as intense as the previous books I have read.  I thought this book went on and on and it would have read much better if it was about 1/3 shorter.  Nesbo is migrating into movie rights for his books and those should be good when they come out.  There is one more book after this one which is surprising when you read this.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a fun puzzle and you don't lose the pieces. I have tried all the. Combinations and absolutely love this app.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I had read this book once in 5th grade, but hadn't quite understood it. Now, that I am older, I have come to the realization that &#34;The Giver&#34; is breathtaking and heartbreakingly beautiful.
B001HN6922|5.0|What can I say.  Loved Cars and family could not wait to get and see Cars 2.  We were not disappointed.  Animation was excellent, story line easy to follow, kids enjoyed all the action, and I enjoyed the humor.  Great moral lesson.
B00GME9AJK|4.0|what a jerk. a genius, motivating, brilliant...jerk. very solid movie. Read Isaacson's Bio a while back so I thought I'd be disappointed but that's not the case.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It is a great book to read it has meaning and value. It teaches the kids morals.and kindness hope joy
B00C74SHRK|5.0|I loved this book.  Beautiful writing with standout characters and a page-turning plot.  A very modern novel with a Dickensian heart.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Great story.  Well photographed, animation was awesome, well worth the money.  This is a keeper.  Packaged extremely well protected.  Shipped quickly and received sooner than expected.  Good Value for the money.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I like the game at first but I was so happy when i unlocked Yevetty but then it asks me for 2,000 coins and I don't have that I wonder If I have to pay for the others too.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I really enjoy this free game! Great graphics, gameplay, and monster variety. But, unless you plan on spending real money, be prepared to wait. In order  to level up, upgrade equipment, or regenerate potions, you have to wait a few hours unless you speed it up with $$.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved this story... If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend you do so!  I couldn't put it down.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|very fun game, if you like hunting games this one is your best bet its definitely the best for kindle fire!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Interesting and a quick read not a book I would normally pick out. Overall it was alright but I would borrow from a friend and save the money
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun, but I have to thank my friends for introducing me to it. This game is in MegaPixels, and big ones to. That's Minecraft's charm.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is stylish, well written, well acted and spooky as heck.  But, I couldn't stop watching.  Mesmerizing!  Don't miss it !
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super easy set up.  Works well.  Its nice to Youtube music videos on the big screen wirelessly with the surround sound.  $35!!! Google does it again.
B00BKZUVGM|2.0|Absolutely LOVED this series (...well the first two books) But this book RUINED the whole series for me! Really disappointed with it - I don't mind drama but the whole plot of this book was just stupid and didn't really have a direction or purpose - if you are a lover of this series I would let your imagination work out the conclusion to the cliff hanger end of the second book and not let this book ruin the series for you!
B00005JMJG|5.0|Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind is still one my my favorite movies of all time.  It's beautiful, emotional, deep, layered, imaginative, and above all, it captures a human element that registers with everyone.  Jim Carrey is absolutely brilliant as Joel, who is shy, reserved, and essentially the polar opposite of Jim Carrey's usual roles.  Kate Winslet is also amazing as Clementine, the quintessential impulsive, independent, and self-serving id to Joel's ego.  I have yet to meet someone who has seen this movie and not agreed that it deserves heaps of praise and acclaim. If for some reason you've never given this flick a watch, DO SO.  You'll be happy that you did.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The best season yet developed, with a cliff hanger at the end. Two key characters leave the series opening the door to new, fresh faces.
B00G21XNKU|4.0|Wrapped up a few loose ends and opened a great new storyline. A not to miss episode if your a fan (casual or serious) of the series.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Where writer and director Jeff Nichols set \\"Take Shelter\\" (2011) in the American Midwest, \\"Mud\\" takes place in rural Arkansas, on the Mississippi River. The milieu and young cast  conjure memories of Mark Twain's \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and the 1986 film \\"Stand By Me\\". Fourteen-year-old friends Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) set out for a small island in the Mississippi with plans to claim a motorboat that was stuck in a tree on the island during a flood. But they find someone else has beaten them to it. A mysterious drifter calling himself \\"Mud\\" (Matthew McConaughey) is living on the island and asks the boys to bring him food. When they do, he has some more challenging requests and regales them with tales of a long-lost love named \\"Juniper\\" with whom he intends to reunite soon.<br /><br />The strong sense of place in Jeff Nichols' films lends them a potency that the stories alone might not have. Nichols returns to his native Arkansas for \\"Mud\\". This is his strongest effort since \\"Shotgun Stories\\" (2007), and this one's a little more optimistic. \\"Mud\\" is part coming-of-age tale, part suspense. From the moment the boys meet Mud, it doesn't look like this character could come to a good end, but Nichols keeps us guessing. Ellis is quick to take the romantic view of Mud. Neckbone is more circumspect. The audience will tend to think that Mud could not be what he says, but it is difficult to know what to make of him. Ellis, meanwhile, is getting conflicting views of love, from Mud's stories, his parent's crumbling marriage, and his own painful experiences with a slightly older girl. \\"Mud\\" is slow to reveal its secrets.<br /><br />The DVD (LionsGate 2013) has no bonus features, but subtitles are available in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in Spanish.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I totally suggest it . But it can get a little addictive.I hope that every one gets this game.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Old school Ipod nano and classic user should rejoice! This product worked immediately with a 5th gen nano and 4th gen Classic. It paired with the bluetooth to FM receiver I got. The sound quality is much better then 3.5mm and best of all the pause forward and reverse buttons all work with the units. So if I get a call or need to pause the music I push the button on the fm transmitter and it works on the ipods because of this device! PERFECT!!
B000FVE3AC|4.0|When it has came down to Invicta, they definitely have been the quality leader in making great watches over the years, not just in demand, but class and innovation. They have made some really great automatic watches for the past several years, but the demand of their great timepieces has definitely exploded over the past years. But for anyone that wants a over-sized timepiece without worry about the price, this is definitely one I recommend. This Pro Diver Grand Diver Automatic is a great timepiece that is simple and easy to take care of. What I honestly love abut this piece isn't just the style, but the blue face and excellent illumination of the watch. What I do though wish was that this piece would be a bit easier to open and close with the safety lock. It can be uncomfortable, and the unidirectional bezel can stick a bit. But nevertheless, thi is a good watch to get for anyone that wants a bulky automatic, without the waste of price.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: B-<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I loved the first three albums so much that I didn't think it was possible, but I think that this one is her best yet. I'm glad I picked up the Deluxe edition, as usual, I found songs on it that I like as much as on the standard album.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|One of his best, never thought I could enjoy music sung in a different language but his voice makes up for it.

B008Y5OW20|5.0|Jeff's version of some old classics as only he can do them. If you want to score sentimental points with your significant other, play this for her. Guaranteed to get results.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|OK James Bond film  kind of a let down from Daniel Craigs previous films. Audio streaming could be improved .. plot a little too unbelievable
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|great game! Some times it is a little complicated to understand which object can be used or not but otherwise it is really good
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun, and very adicting. I wish there was a way to earn boosters though as I am one of those people who wont spend the money.
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|Strong, colorful, longlasting.  Not much thicker than the 4/4s when installed. Many colors available.  Easy on and off.  Not too slippery
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|really slow start - so slow that I turned it off and didn't go back to it. I heard it got better, but...
B00EPFEY44|5.0|I have almost every andrea bocelli cd to date and this just came out and i'm thinking to myself do i really need another one ? So i bought it and honestly its just as good as always his last cd and this one have alot of new material which i appreciate after alot pf semi redundant cd's with to many songs that were the same with different arrangements or duet partners.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Nice humor, excellent premise.  Slow-moving, predictable and with an anti-climactic ending.  DeMille can do better.  Worth the read if you have low expectations.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I'm a big fan of Rollins' Sigma Force novels. I know it's a guy thing, but I go for action novels and movies, and am not attracted to novels that focus on feelings and romances. Pretty much in the same league as Connelly, Crais, Silva, and Child.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|A cute movie cannot wait to give it as a gift ! It's a seriously unique storyline thats heart warming.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|What can I possibly say what has not already been said?  It is an absolute MUST READ for everyone as it helps you understand your purpose on this planet and our constant searching...

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book had me hooked in the first chapter. Highly recommended for anyone that loves a mystery and anything about southern living. Great story!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Not entirely a surprising ending, but a book definitely worth reading. Nice for the long holiday season with pleasant characters
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Very fun, but the new level wont update!<br />What a disapointment. Where can i find an update Would you please help me Rovio?
B0090P98Z4|3.0|great game but do not spend real money on up grades.I had to start over twice for no reason.amazon should be told about this and if l had spend my hard earned money l would really be mad.it seem to happen around level 58-60.if it wasn't for this I would of gave this game 10 out 5.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Great information told in a straight forward way.  I never truly knew anything about James or Jesus' other relatives(cousins).  Thanks.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I really loved this book, and the protagonist, Don Tillman. It's always fun to get into the head of an unreliable narrator, especially one who really is so charming and whose story is as heartfelt as this one. I wish I could find more smart books like this one, that take me through a range of humor and weepy moments like this one does.  Highly recommend this gem.
B00C061I3K|5.0|just an amazing album that shouldnt be missed.  not to mention the price is perfect, only 10 bucks! i bought two as gifts and i am very pleased with my purchase
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read Wonder because my twelve year old granddaughter was reading it and was so enthused about it that I wanted to be able to discuss the book with her. I was completely taken in by this wonderful story. Some have criticized the changes in point of view. I know as a writer myself that point of view is crucial to the story. I think it was done brilliantly. Rather than detract from the story, it gave depth and understanding and made the picture much bigger. I believe this story is a wonderful, realistic accounting of the challenges presented by this child and by his family and friends. I give it a 5 star rating and would highly recommend it for youth or adult, and for groups of young people to read and discuss together. Good job R. J. Palacio.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books, these characters and their story are simply unforgettable.  No matter what you think about the material, this story is a classic,  in the sense that, it's about finding your other half.  That is universal.  No one really wants to be alone and we all crave to have the connection these books refer to.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is okay but you can't get any tokens which is annoying because you can't unlock any places . I don't know about this game it's okay
B007EC27QM|4.0|Sure beats the calculator on my phone.  Nice big buttons.  Add some basic trig functions and it would be perfect!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've always been a Stephen King fan, and his latest work did not disappoint me in the least!  Doctor Sleep is a continuation of The Shining.  It takes place several years after The Shining, and brings us once again into the strange world of Danny Torrance, as he struggles with his past demons, as well as new ones.  I honestly don't want to go much further into describing the book, because, let's face it, readers don't want to hear it from me, they want to hear it from King.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Cool, great buy. Got on you tube and watched a how-to video so setup was very easy. Works as expected.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Unlike many sequels this book carries its own weight and further develops the challenge involved in different sentients, completely alien to each other, trying to find a way to communicate and coexist.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|It brings to light the cruelty Humans are inflicting to these very intelligent gentle giants. They are best to be left in the wild and hopefully with this Doc (creating public anger and pressure) it might be possible for one’s in captivity now to be set free. I hope they will release Tilikum back in the wild soon.<br />I hope everyone will Boycott SEAWORLD after watching this and force it to go out of business once and for all.<br />Children need to be taught that this is not OK.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A really good game and simple to get the hang of. There is no need to spend money on crystals or energy, wait for the energy to gather again and you don't need crystals many things anyway.
