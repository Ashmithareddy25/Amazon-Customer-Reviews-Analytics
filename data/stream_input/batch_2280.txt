B002OMZTSK|5.0|High school is hard, and Russel Middlebrook is here to tell you it's a whole lot harder when you're gay. So Russel and his friends start a gay/straight/bisexual alliance support group called the \\"Geography Club,\\" because really, who would want to join a geography club? Russel and his friends figure they'll have a safe place where they can talk and support one another. But life is never that easy.<br /><br />Russel's voice is real, and you will become a student at Goodkind High School as you read this book. He shows you what it feels like to be bullied and to be a bully. You'll experience a first crush, the ups and downs of teen life, and what it's like to be different. You'll enjoy friendship and endure betrayal. And even though much of this book is serious matter, Russel tells it in an engaging, often humorous way, and if you don't identify with the main character, you'll want to be his bff.<br /><br />The admiral thing about Brent Hartinger's ability as a writer is that even though this is a book about teen agers, adults will find it intriguing, enlightening, and enjoyable. This is the first book in the Russel Middlebrook series, and after just a few pages in, I was hooked. I highly recommend this series.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|A page turner.  John Corey is at his best in the sands of Yemen.  Mr. Demille actually sent time in the that country to do research for this book.  Great job Nelson can't wait for the next one.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is so wonderful!!! it's mind bobbling and, it is just soooooo addicting!!! even though it is similar to the galactic game, this one is more portable and it has more levels!!! it even has more aliens that you have to shoot and dodge!!! i highly recommend this game for all ages, young or old!!!
B0007IN318|5.0|The unkind would say that the author manufactured a book around Roman water systems and the eruption of Pompeii.  And while the end is a bit weak, it is a &#34;crackling good read,&#34; as they say.  It's a good detective story with some interesting twists and turns.  It's a not bad love story.  And it is paired with a tremendous exposition on Roman aqueducts and the importance of water in the Roman world.<br /><br />Once you start, you don't want to put the book down -- the entire family enjoyed it.  Highly recommended.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|The game is challenging! It has searches by object name, category,  and shape. Sometimes you are also asked to find differences between two pictures. It comes with mini games as well. The characters and storyline kept things interesting.<br /><br />What I really liked about this game, though, was its interface. It was intuitive and well thought out. When looking for differences between pictures, the zoom feature automatically zoomed both pics at the same time. It also had no problem identifying where your finger is pressing, which is great because many of the objects are small.<br /><br />My only nitpick is that sometimes there are two of the same object in the picture, where one of them is the item you're looking for and one isn't. However, there isn't really a penalty for choosing the wrong one, so I guess it's alright.

B0001GL3K4|3.0|This may be OK for a 30 something person but way too shallow a storyline for us.  The story had it's funny moments, but the vulgarity over shadowed the fun parts.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|Lean in provides a strong point of view that I agree with, having noticed self sabotaging behavior in myself and in other women.  When the men jostle for position in a boardroom and you can almost smell the testosterone, the women hang back and take the seats at the back, away from the table, physically and metaphorically.<br /><br />I have avoided calling myself a feminist for exactly the same reasons that Ms Sandberg mention in the book, but I realised that indeed, I am a feminist.  I care deeply about the younger women I work with, about their professional progress and ability to cope in challenges.  I care deeply about the rural women that live in totally unjust societies on the continent where I live.  If speaking up gives me the &#34;label&#34; of feminist, then I will happily wear it.<br /><br />A great book that must be read by all women.  And it must be compulsory reading for any man before he may be promoted into a  leadership position.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This is a great game. It makes you think strategically. I am hooked already and cant put the game down. It's worth having.
B0079LSJ6A|4.0|With strong arguments that cannot be ignored, Ms Fine rattled my cage and upset my dearly held opinions about gender behavior popularly ascribed to differences in male and female brain function.<br />Altough I am not ready to fully let go of all those opinions, I will be considerably less blase when voicing it in future. The book has created an awareness in me of how, subltly but surely, bahavior can be influenced by mere suggestion.  I will be considerably more vigilant in my observations in future.
B00BGIC170|4.0|This film was great. It truly lived up to the expectations I had with any Judd Apatow comedy. Very romantic for the \\"Chick Flick\\" lover (like my girlfriend) and for guys like me a well rounded comedy that had me rolling throughout.

B000001EPB|4.0|Michael Flatley shouldn't have been on top of the dancing world yet his persistence and drive made a small boy into a world class dancer. the skill with which he executed the dances and the attitude that he displayed make you want to listen and/or watch over and over. The only downside to this album is that the songs don't have the background of the Irish Dance. they're pure music, until the two bonus tracks. that combination of the rousing Hardiman score and ensemble cast of phenomenal dancers bring to life a time and a culture that isn't found anywhere today.

6304779607|4.0|Why do Sylvester Stallone movies always have such bad acting? I've often wondered. Finally, I think I understand. Stallone, himself, is a terrible actor and there's no way to remediate it except to surround him with equally bad actors, either the good guys or the bad guys. Except for the women, of course and they're usually much better and quite beautiful. Does this work? Well, in Cobra, the acting is just awful, but does anyone care? I think not. You watch a Stallone movie for the unrelenting action, the really extended chase scenes, the destruction and violence, the body count and, yes, everything is so extreme that it's actually funny. All these things come together in Cobra. Who cares if the story  doesn't make particularly good sense? To notice that a functioning steel mill has no workers is just being picky. Of course it has no workers, they're filming a Stallone movie, you idiot.<br /><br />Cobra, AKA Marion Cobretti, is a typical Stallone movie. It's very entertaining even though it doesn't make good sense and the acting is atrocious. I should indicate that the production of the movie is quite good. The stunts, especially in the car driving scenes, are spectacularly done, except that I hated to see that beautifully customized '50 Mercury destroyed. Well, they made up for it with the scene where Stallone was machine-gunning a good-sized contingent of hotly pursuing motorcyclists from standing in the back of a speeding pickup truck. How do they ever do those scenes? How do they make them look so realistic? I wonder what the body count in this movie was anyhow. Let's not worry about it. Cobra was Stallone being Stallone ad it made for an entertaining evening of watching.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B009AMAMF2|5.0|A great movie. Having not read the book, it did seem to jump around a bit as though the story was compressed into too little time.  Maybe a four hour movie would have been perfect.<br />Unfortunately it is not available on Amazon on-demand, Netflix, iTunes, Hulu+, PlayStation store or XBox video.  Forcing us to go old-school and buy the physical disc to rip into our library.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Child rape and sexual abuse is a very serious psychological problem. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think child sexual abuse can be treated so easily by a teenaged boy with a trouble and anguished past. It was obvious from the beginning that Sky has repressed her feelings about sex. I have known victims of sexual abuse and it is not easy for them to replace fear and shame and jump into a full-fledged sexual relationship. They've shielded their bodies from feeling anything into a comforting numbness. Even after a lot of therapy, there are certain places or ways of touching that trigger distress. But in this story, Holder waltzes in and starts messing with Sky. He not only messes with her body, he messes with her mind. He insults her, then acts like he gets to order her around. \\"Who gave you the d*** bracelet, Sky?\\" He even gets physically abusive when his grip tightens around her wrist and he's staring at her coldly, expecting an explanation.<br /><br />Holder acts like he owns her when he hardly knows her. To me, it triggers all the warning bells control, abusive, stalker. Then it turns out that he knew who she was all along, and had looked all over for her. Well, I'll say no more on this because I don't want to spoil the story. I also wonder at the continuous use of the words \\"hopeless boy\\" throughout the story because it was too much, like any repetitive gesture it becomes cliched.<br /><br />The other thing that was so unbelievable are the flashbacks. They totally kicked me out of the story. Believe me, I had to check the date twice. 2012, 1999, not 2009? okay, 2012-1999 = 13. Sky and Holder are 17 and 18. That means they were 4 and 5. But they didn't talk or think like 5 year olds, more like 15 year olds. I worried that there was a mistake, it had to be 2009, right? But no. The concepts and language of these 4 and 5 year olds, what they remembered and the details and explanation was pretty unbelievable. And I don't understand the math where the author refers to Holder as 6 years old. Even if he just turned 6 in June 1999, he can't be 18 in Oct 2012. But still, the detail and deep psychological concepts that he remembers is a stretch for even a 6 year old, although he was only 5 if you do the math.<br /><br />I liked Sky's friends, Six and Breckin. They made the book tolerable. They cared about Sky and give her reassurance and affirmation. I also really liked Karen, especially after I figured out why she did what she did. The story was pretty obvious and predictable, so it was just watching what the next step would be and wondering how the author would present it.<br /><br />I would like to add that there is underaged sex at the end of the book after some pretty disturbing things come to light. I didn't find that night of passion realistic considering the traumatic experience both of them witness [again I won't spoil it, but it is serious and they were covered with bodily fluids and tissues], so I wonder why the author had to give us the gratuitous sex scenes. I believe the story would have been stronger without this considering the abuse suffered. Come to think of it, Holder's an adult who took an underaged girl across state lines for sexual purposes, and of course nothing happens at the scene of the crime, no investigation, no witnesses. How convenient. Oh, and I didn't find him ordering her to get on birth control pills very romantic. What a dweeb. It's her body, she should get to decide whether she wants to mess it up with hormones and all sorts of nasty chemicals. And she's underaged!<br /><br />But I did like the ending, especially the reconciliation with Karen. Now that is a brave woman, a selfless woman, and one who was the true hero of the book. The ending was almost satisfying, but of course I wonder if these two damaged characters are really healed by the rush of revelations and tragic events and whether they'll be suffering longer term post traumatic stress disorder.Holder as 6 years old.

B003QP4BJM|5.0|A good combination of budget and anthropological history. Lots of research went into this one. Five more words to complete review.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Easy payouts and rapid advancement make this game fun to play, with just the right level of silliness to be worthy of the Ice Age movie franchise.<br /><br />[UPDATE] Unfortunately, the Ice Age world feels just a little empty right now. My neighbors are either abandoned new villages, or maxed-out hyper-arranged megaplexes, with not much in between. This is typical of my experience with Gamelon product line--they rely heavily on social interaction to make progress in the game, which rapidly loses its playability when the crowd moves to greener pastures.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I don't find many books like this: full of heart, meaning and soul. A great joy to read. I thank the author and all who helped make this book possible.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|I bought this with high hopes and am disappointed to be honest. It dies amolify the sound. Recharges nice. The eq settings make a muddy improvement. The biggest issue is your headphone remote stops working. You must fumble to find this device to adjust volume. Track changing is gone. On top of that you have another thing hanging off your device (which quicky becomes annoying.)  also another device to charge. My suggestion: use the money twds a better set of headphones.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a well-written account of a woman's nightmare relationship and consequences.  The author effectively uses the switch between time periods to keep the reader keen.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Chris Hemsworth looks like a Nordic god. It is that simply. This man looks like he could literally be Thor. His emotional journey into a mature leader is obvious to anyone older than twelve, but he travels the well-worn road convincingly. The plot is simplistic and unsatisfying (perhaps the writers were depending on the anticipation of the Avengers project to sell Thor for them), but Hemsworth does such a great job in his role that this weakness is easy to overlook.

B004EPZ07U|3.0|In brightest day, in blackest night, no corny joke shall escape my sight. I love superhero movies and my allegiance has always been with DC Comics, but let's be honest. Marvel rules the comic book movie world, so I was very excited to learn of a Green Lantern film coming out. It is definitely worth viewing, but Ryan Reynolds is simply unconvincing as Hal Jordan. He is just too goofy.

B004YM6JI2|4.0|I really love this show! It has been consistently good. However, I was not overly fond of the Leviathan story line, and as I have with many previous seasons, I found myself looking forward to those stand alone episodes in which Sam and Dean fought the monster of the week.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was happy that after reading three books it was tied up nicely.  I wish I could have read them back to back to keep the characters straight from the previous two books.
B001GCUO5W|4.0|This is one of those films that absolutely require more than one viewing. Once you know what is going on, you have to rewatch it to see how it all plays out in front of you. After seeing the movie once, the viewer is greeted with dozens of great shout-outs to waht is really going on!
B00111YM5G|1.0|The story line was too dark and sinister.  My daughter threw the movie in the trash as soon as she watched it......never to watch it again.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I do not know how I missed this all these years, but I recently was introduced to this fantastic show. After watching all the episodes, I immediately had to grab a copy of it. It is that good. There are a handful of scenes that are inappropriate for small children, but it is a great little series. Be forewarned: this show was canceled shortly into the premier season. It will leave you wanting more in such a way that is reminiscent of an itch in the middle of your back just beyond your finger tips.
B00005JPTK|5.0|Love this movie so had to buy it! Its great that it has an alternate ending, and it also gives you a free copy to put on your laptop!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Ridley Scott's return to the Alien films does not disappoint. It answers several questions left hanging by the original movie, and Ridley Scott is a master at slowly developing a story. Honestly, I found this to be very refreshing in a world which seemingly requires steady action. Prometheus moves in the same slow pace that the original films did, but it holds your attention the whole time. The only issue with the film is a couple of very minor inconsistencies when this film is watched immediately before a viewing of Alien.
B000JML7EC|5.0|Great book.  Wonderful story to read to children.  I read it to my daughter instead of letting her watch TV.

B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I am not sure if the people who already wrote reviews on this movie have ever been in long term relationships but I am guessing not. This movie is funny because it shows the ups and downs that couples go through when they have been together for a long time. Marriage is hard and sad and funny and all of that is rolled into this movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was amazing.<br />It has lots of action and adventure.<br />But the ending leaves you wanting to read more but it ends,

B005IZNM0W|5.0|Here's Max Schnell, one of the 11 race cars in the Cars 2 World Grand Prix race, and although the photo accompanying this listing shows WGP packaging, the model # (V2815) on the listing along with the &quot;#21&quot; in the title indicates that it's part of the original &quot;numbered singles&quot; line released after Cars 2, with a little &quot;21&quot; in the left corner of the packaging, meaning he was the 21st (out of 50.)  If you're a collector, might want to double check to make sure you're getting what you want!  He represents Germany, and is very neat looking with his purple/black/yellow/red designing, resembling a BMW M3 GTR.  (A list of the racers for parents/grandparents who, same as the position we were in several years back, aren't sure who's who?  Francesco Bernoulli, Lewis Hamilton, Max Schnell, Miguel Camino, Raoul CaRoule, Shu Todoroki, Carla Veloso, Nigel Gearsley, Rip Clutchgoneski, Jeff Gorvette, Lightning McQueen.)<br /><br />10/7/15 Update:  I'm adding the following couple of paragraphs strictly for the benefit of anyone considering starting a collection - don't spend any time on them if you're only looking for one or two of these diecasts.  When we started collecting Mattel's Cars 2 1:55 scale diecasts for our oldest grandson in early 2012, there were SO many choices when it came to singles... 50 &quot;numbered&quot; packages (along with 14 &quot;Deluxe&quot; numbered packages), &quot;Lights &amp; Sounds&quot;, &quot;Pit Stop Launchers&quot;, cars with &quot;synthetic rubber tires&quot; or &quot;metallic finish&quot;... and multi-packs to boot!  We were completely overwhelmed and confused.  Ended up deciding to stick with the &quot;numbered&quot; packages (probably a bit naive since - at least at that time - we might've found some better deals with the 2/3/4/5/7/10 or 12 packs, but you have to have a strategy if you go that route since there are so many duplications), along with the Super Chase models.  Then in November of that year, they started coming out with a bunch THEMED series, &quot;lenticular&quot; singles, etc... it's so easy to spend a small fortune (and we did!), so I'm glad we at least set the parameters for our collection early on before we got too sidetracked (and spent our retirement funds!)  We've had a couple of more grandsons since then, so we really feel it's been money well spent given the high level of durability of these small models and the enjoyment they get out of playing with them.  There are so many ways to collect, and obviously the more recent the releases, the more readily available (and more reasonable) you'll find them.<br /><br />For anyone who might be interested in knowing what those original &quot;numbered&quot; singles packages were, here's the (very long) list:  1) Race Team Mater, 2) Finn McMissile, 3) Lightning McQueen with Racing Wheels, 4) Francesco Bernoulli, 5) Holley Shiftwell, 6) Professor Z, 7) Jeff Gorvette, 8) Carla Veloso, 9) Raoul CaRoule, 10&amp;11 (together) Race Team Luigi &amp; Race Team Guido, 12) Acer, 13) Grem, 14) Race Team Fillmore, 15) Race Team Sarge, 16) Rod Torque Redline, 17) Miles Axlerod, 18) Petrov Trunkov, 19) Hydraulic Ramone, 20) Nigel Gearsley, 21) Max Schnell, 22) Shu Todoroki, 23) Miguel Camino, 24) Lewis Hamilton, 25) Carlo Maserati, 26) Hudson Hornet Piston Cup Lightning McQueen, 27) Mel Dorado, 28) Vladimir Trunkov, 29) Radiator Springs Ramone, 30) Victor H., 31) Don Crumlin, 32) Officer Murakarmi, 33) Becky Wheelin, 34) Acer with Torch, 35) Kabuto, 36) Rip Clutchgoneski, 37) Bindo, 38) Celine Dephare, 39) Erik Laneley, 40) Cartney Brakin, 41) Galloping Geargrinder, 42) Prince Wheeliam, 43) Otis, 44) Suki, 45) Alex Vandel, 46) Nick Cartone, 47) Fabrizio, 48) Alexander Hugo with Party Hat, 49) Mary Esgocar, 50) Sir Harley Gassup.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Very good game im enjoying it play is easy only down side is the peanuts which you have to buy if you want to speed things up.  Still a good game though.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Its cool, affordable and strong material to hold a 20 inch screen, its nice and smooth and it came on time.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Great way to keep track of what you are watching and buying.  This app also makes selling easy, allowing uploads of information &amp; pictures...you no longer need a computer to sell!  The only negative is being unable to pay one seller for multiple items in one transaction.  For that you need a computer!
B009X01C64|4.0|The quality and design of the Revolve for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is much better than other cases I've seen and touched.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that removing my Kindle from the case is no easy task.  I attempted to follow the written and video instructions with no luck.  I'm afraid to apply too much pressure in case the plastic holder cracks.  If you never plan to remove your Kindle from the case, this is a non-issue.  If someone else knows the trick to removing the Kindle without applying extreme pressure, I'll gladly upgrade my review to five stars.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I have ordered two Downton Abbey DVD packages so my wife can get caught up on her new addiction. Bothe shipments came in a timely fashion. You should use a soft cloth to clean before using because for some  reason some dust is on the discs. Other tan that I am quite pleased with Amazon's wide selections and great service.
B008JFUNQO|5.0|5 stars for cracking up my 5 year old boy so hard all throughout the movie. My boy does not care about the quality of the story line or predictability. He just laughed his butt off. For me, I am a 5 year old by mind and heart so I did the same.
B000002P74|5.0|I have loved this album for 30 years, good to finally have it on CD. CD is in excellent condition, as it is new.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Is worth paying $6.99 and you should buy it.<br />It is so epic!!! In it you can connect on creative.
B006P0FIGU|4.0|Movie is good rewrite of the original novel, with embelishments thrown in to spice up the story. DVD was in excellent condition, as advertised.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I have to say first of all that I really enjoyed Knocked Up, hilarious movie.<br /><br />This movie was just ok.  It definitely has a few funny moments.  In retrospect, I paid 5 bucks to rent it and I think it was probably worth the $1.99 of some other titles.  It's not bad, especially compared to a lot of what is out there, but I would pay the $5 happily for Knocked Up (in fact I bought it) and this one was worth 2 bucks max.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Excellent season, with the deaths of Sybil & then Matthew. I can hardly wait for the new season to be available here in the States!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The story line was cute but really not believable. But I read for pleasure and not for real life depressing events.
B007N85POS|5.0|This version is my favorite, by far.  The backgrounds are cuter, and I like setting the little birds free (although, getting those giggling monkeys is fun, too).
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I rented this movie on direct tv and I watched it four times. I had to own it. Such a good movie. The shipping was fast and it was packaged properly. Also, the price was right.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|It starts easy but builds and is quite fun you wont go wrong.  You start and before you know its hours are gone.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|Love the challenge but not too hard.Just like the way its made with hidden object n a few puzzles.Don't like getting free n then being too pay over I get into it.
B004YXE438|4.0|Its a slide puzzle its a puzzle combined makes a wierd but fun game to keep you thinking.  Its worth a bit of time killing but will not hold you for hours.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Whetjer it is a short story, a novella, or a novel, you can always depend on Mr. King to come through.  This story moves well, and I did not see the ending coming at all.  I can't wait for my next fix of Stephen King.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Finding the hidden objects and using them to unlock clues is engaging and interesting.  I can't wait to unlock more of the mystery.
0399224459|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy reading Good Night Gorilla with my almost four year old grandson, and he delights in it. Reading perhaps, though, isn't the right word. Indeed, there are few words in the book: good night and the names of several animals and a few words on signs. The charm and the story are in the drawings, and they are wonderful; the detail is enchanting, and they invite discussion and story telling by the \\"reader.\\" Our favorite character is the animal who's never named in the book: the mouse; look for him on most every page.
B000BT97AO|5.0|My whole family loves this movie.  The shipping was very fast and the quality of the product was very very good.  I am a very satified customer.
1603420398|3.0|Very nice...however don't show correct instructions to joint the squares.  Is a very beautiful book, with great designs  and colours.
B001J710Y8|1.0|Well I wrote a rather scathing review of the seller because its not what I ordered. I ordered the Wicker man that is advertised from the 1970's. The original movie is amazing, but I was sent the remake. The Remake on first watch was horrible compared to the original. I watched it again and with the alternative ending the remake has it wasn't as terrible as I thought. Now, again Its absolutely Not what I ordered. I complained and they didn't get back to me though they have an 100% guarantee on their website. I won't return what I got because its six dollars and a hassle since I don't have a post office nearby. I would absolutely recommend the original movie.
B0067R0APK|2.0|I liked the previous version.  It was easier to read had more settings options and color choices.  prefer the weather channel app now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing I can't stop reading the series, I have literally stayed up til 3 am these past three nights completing the trio. I have one book left. Buying the kindle fire hd 8.9 has definitely proved to be a good choice the price you pay pales in comparison to the magnitude of the value. I love it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Its cute and intriguing. Now my only hang up is getting neighbors. So please add me! Thank you! Storm8 is natera11...
1455502758|4.0|great perspective of how it is when someone is dying, how people respond to you and how you might feel about it.  Atheist perspective
B00B99KJR0|3.0|I picked this up free, and it's a decent time waster. Great to play on lunch or waiting in an office.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you enjoy Lord of the Rings, then The Hobbit is an admirable extension of the series. I look forward to future movies from this series....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|its awsome ,the actors are the best. i cant wait for season 4.<br />i was so glad that we got amazon instant video !!!!
630469654X|5.0|I LOVE this story. Yes, it is an old movie, but still very easy to relate to. The scenery is beautiful, the costumes magnificent and a wonderful piece of fantasy. If you haven't seen it, you really should!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Another great movie for Tommy Lee Jones. It has great suspense through out the hole movie. Has a great line up of cast's a lot of great movie star's in this. You will enjoy watching this good movie.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|best game ever this is amazing so realistiic I play it every day of the weak just incredible bye dude
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is th e best game ever I love it I play it every day and I can't believe how much of it I play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive game! So much fun to play and you win tokens to level up. You have to try it! Come join me.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I'm actually not finished playing but i'm tired of being bugged to review it.  Just to kill time it seems fun.  If i'd been allowed to actually finish i might have more to say..<br />Update: I enjoyed it.  Not too demanding--gives plenty of time for each segment, easy to keep adding to available # of hints.  Fits myrequirementof passing time without too much being asked of me but enough to be interesting.<br />After I did the first review it has left me alone since and doesn't have the incessant ads popping up like most free apps.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I loved this game in reminds me of going to the arcades in 80's super cool!! I love this game!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|One of the best books I've read in awhile- truly inspiring. I feel like a member of that group of friends now!
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. I like the variety of games. They are challenging, yet solvable. Requires strategy and thoughtful planning. Good levels of difficulty. Very enjoyable.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|If you like early KISS albums The first ALIVE era....Then this one is for you. Thayer and Singer also shine on vocals. I was not expecting much. Fooled again by KISS!!! Hopefully they will continue on for years to come. The live show can last forever and it should. They are an EVENT!!! A Franchise!!! A great success story. If Gene and Paul replace themselves live,,,I'll still Go!! The whole idea of KISS simply rocks. It's uniquely American. This is a great album to introduce the next generation of fans, then take them to see the tour!!! It's like '74 again!!  Funny how many 70's bands are still out there but KISS is still the frontrunner...........UPDATE!!! Seen the MONSTER TOUR!! The Spider etc.<br />I loved it, best concerts I've ever seen and most fun for sure. Buy this Album if you like HARD ROCK. Paul Stanley is incredible Live. The show's timing and interaction even if the same on a nightly basis (everyone gets a great show)is flawless and with all the pyro I can understand why.... KISS are really good to the fans and keep product out there. Some people say that's greedy but there is a demand and if it wasn't there,well People would be asking for it!! I like it all!! Congratulations to KISS.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|cool app but be careful when u earn gems or buy them. I did a download for free 19 gems andnit didn't work :(
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This film has a good balance between some hard core scifi writing and action. The acting was very good as well.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I thought I was listening to someone else I had to catch my breath for a minute. I can honestly say this is a let down coming from JT and Timbaland. I guess if you like John legend and slow Prince with some Maxwell elements.. then this is for you. But this is certainly not what I expected from two innovators/pioneers of music. Timbaland has been off the scene for a minute and maybe this is the reason why. This is better than average for mainstream music for sure. But its definitely not going to change music history like his first two Lps they made. Justified played solid on the radio for 3 years at least. Futuresex played from 2006 to 2008 before it cooled off finally. This album trust me will be over the end of this year if not sooner. There are just no strong singles like the previous two efforts. The songs sound two much alike and the music kinda all runs together. There are no stand outs like My love or Cry me a river just retreads of there past glory. I tried to like this album but after one or two listens its like ok..whats next? It just doesn't have the production values craftsmanship or originality of the previous two records. This could be a result of trying to do two things at once or a sign of a fading artist. This will certainly not change music or bring any new fans to the table. \\"Carry Out\\" to me was a lot better than most of the tracks on this lp as a whole. As a collective the album is really uneven and has its highs and lows for sure. To chose Pusher love girl and Suit and Tie as the first two songs  definitely doesn't set the album up well. Those are hardly songs that would open a epic album and prepare us for whats coming next. Timbaland has experimented with so many sounds in the past so many styles of music and created masterpieces. I am sure they could have come up with something fuller more orchestrated than this. Where are the feel good songs on this album ? The last LP felt like a collaborative effort between Timbaland, Danja and JT. This album feels more like late night sessions or outtakes from there past efforts.<br /><br />Here are the stand outs on the album to me:<br /><br />(Tunnel vision) - Good song sounds like the duo I use to know but still missing something but clearly the best track on here.<br /><br />(Strawberry bubblegum) - Good song nice beat would have fit nicely as # 12 on the last album<br /><br />(Don't hold the Wall) - Nice track kinda old school but pleasant sounding.<br /><br />&<br /><br />(Mirrors) - Same beat as Cry me A River and What comes around, but familiar territory and sounds like JT  Nice lyrics and song structure.<br /><br />As for the rest ????????<br /><br />Sounds to much like 90's R&B or someone else from the past. It sounds more like a montage to other artist than himself. I think he is slowly losing his more eclectic electro audience by the hour with this. This is a good album if you are in to R&B grooves but if not? I would take a rain check on this one for sure. I personally listen to a lot of different styles of music most are not mainstream. And JT was my last saving grace to mainstream, so I am pretty disappointed. He is slowly disintegrating into everyone Else's style which is pretty disappointing to say the least. I don't mind mellow if its done with originality  Aaliyah's mellower stuff was more original than this. And this is coming from the same producer so am sure they could have done better. This is the first JT album that I wasn't able to enjoy from A to Z.<br /><br />First Madonna and now this :(<br /><br />So far the best album I have heard in  awhile is<br />Crystal Castles III<br />Take notes from those Guys.<br />Listen to<br /><br />Affection & Kerosene<br />http://www.amazon.com/III-Crystal-Castles/dp/B009GYSQV6/ref=ntt_mus_ep_dpi_1<br /><br />Good luck on the next project.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|well sometimes it says &quot;cant retrieve tweets try later&quot; way too often and I don't like it. but otherwise its okay.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Decent enough same old story. Wish there was something more that the characters were given more of a back story to change it up.
B001AQT0UY|2.0|This happened to be on \\"free\\" TV today, and I was too lazy to change the channel.  And so while working on a computer, doing something almost as scary as this film -- installing Windows 8 on a Samsung Tablet -- I watched and listened to this epic disaster.<br /><br />I clicked the \\"Info\\" button on my favorite television provider, and I was shocked to see that 80 percent or more of critics liked this thing!  How is that even possible?  Perhaps they were taken hostage by the scary little Gremlins in the film, and told that, if those critics gave a bad review, that they would be tied up and forced to watch the film over and over, until their eyes and their ears bled out?<br /><br />Well, on the bright side, their is Phoebe Cates.  She's certainly not scary, at least to look at.  But if you're over five years old, how can you appreciate a film with fake little puppets, bad acting, and no real adult humor?  This would be a big pass by me.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This reminds me of the old space invaders game I grew up on, with a twist.  I've only begun playing the game and I'm hooked.  Well done!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|i cant stop playing! great way to kill time....if you have the time. very relaxing too. i recommend this app!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Necessary app for doing quick calculations on the kindle. Easy to use. Operates just like a hand held calculator with out carrying one around. Can't live without it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is ok. What happen to me was I had a great score and it rested and now I have to start.all over. :(
B0000DYKET|5.0|I highly recommend these.  When I bought mine (2009) I was working around houses, climbing onto roofs, and wanted exactly what these looked like: durable, sturdy, secure hold/fit on the foot, toe-cap for ladders, roofing, bushes, etc.  They're solid, yet, they're surprisingly light-weight material.  I've had other shoes come apart on me, but not these.  These are work horses and have protected my feet extremely well.  They look comfy, and feel even better.  Very good foot support, immediately comfortable with no break-in required, and have not given out or lost the shape or supporting quality; I weigh 260-ish lbs and am on my feet all day with no problems, and the sole has not compressed that I can tell. They are still like-new although the sole has worn some and they've faded.<br /><br />I wear this pair 90% of the time unless I want a dressier sandal.  They wash easily and you can let them dry or they will dry on your feet in summer.  I love them so much for fit and comfort that I bought the closed-shoe style they make for office & winter use, and just ordered my second pair of sandals in another color.  I ordered another pair to be dressier, but I have no reason to replace the first pair.  They are ingeniously designed and made, and I love them.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is quite challenging and addicting.. I was lucky enough to get it free! I would buy it!! you should try it out too!!
034580404X|5.0|it takes a while but the wife is on her 2nd go round with the set..you always miss parts the 1st time. good way to spend a cold snowy evening when tv is lousy !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is one of the best games that I have ever played in my life. I love this game. This game is awesome
B009X01ELC|5.0|I purchased a Marware case for my 7&#34; Kindle and love it. So when I saw they had one for my larger Kindle I didn't hesitate to buy it. Both are fantastic and very well made. They not only protect the devices but they also make it extremely convenient to  stand them up for great viewing. Highly recommend these cases.
1415948216|4.0|I love the unabridged audio books, but you run a risk with used books.  The one had a very small tick on disc 4, but was otherwise in great condition.  I wil definitely do business with this seller gain.
1439192812|5.0|I will keep this short and on point. If you have read his other works then this is basically the same philosophical dialogue but written in a way to ensure that this is easily conveyed to the younger reader.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So many emotions from 1 book that I truly enjoyed. Even with all the sadness it was amazing. It moved me.
0807014273|5.0|Wow! I enjoyed reading this book for a class and I even found myself not being able to place the book down once I started reading it. Ever since I read this book, I have been a more positive person and it comes to my mind in difficult situations. I highly recommend this book!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|Great price and quality, it arrived in less time than I expected. Now I look first here before anywhere else.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very fun! Great controls and neat retro gfx. Would pay for more ship designs and level variation. An essential android game.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This had a lot of potential for me, to be really cool. It started out great, and then degenerated into sort of a &#34;Wrinkle in Time&#34; or Harry Potter sort of thing....it is really sort of juvenile and silly, which was not at all what I was expecting. The old photos add an element of reality to the story...
B008LSVLZG|5.0|The show is excellent and the group  is superb. Actually the music of Steven Wilson alone or with Porcupine Tree and Blackfield make an encounter with 20th century bands specially King Crimson. His music will continue the seeds that Robert Fripp leaves, expanded and take at superior levels. Five stars!
B00ANGICRE|5.0|The Sessions is one of the most Intelligent, sensitive, moving, humorous, thought-provoking, incredibly well-acted movies I have ever seen. I loved it!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  Just kept you wanting to read the next page and then the next............on into the night,
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This movie is a wonderful flick.  I showed it to a group of adults and they enjoyed it just as much as the kids did.  It's going to be a tradition each Christmas to make sure to watch it.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Game seems fun... until you start addind dinosaurs. TREMENDOUSLY laggy on my Kindle Fire. Lag the moving around park, lag when trying to tap on things, lag, lag, lag, lag!  No settings for lower graphic quality was a downside.  Uninstalled.
B00005JOHC|4.0|I bought this in order to see everybody in the show, at their youngest.  You see, I got into this show late, and felt the need to see the beginning, when the show had a nascent quality.  The highlight had to be the show where one of Berta's daughters (a very young Megan Fox) visits the Harper house.  'Tis enough to make me purchase the first eight seasons at least.
B007U8U1V8|3.0|I bought this album on the recommendation of my sons, and I've only listened to it once, but I'm not sure how I feel about it. Because of the digital booklet, I was able to follow the lyrics, which on the first few songs, were somewhat depressing. I plan to listen to it again, which I do with most albums, because sometimes they improve the more you hear them. Also, I tend to ignore reviewing my purchases in general, and music specifically, until I've had a chance to get used to the product. Amazon asks for reviews way too early, in my opinion.
B000WC3864|5.0|This edition has three discs.  The third disc has interviews with the three women of this film.  More special features on the second disc, and of course the film itself on the first disc.  Can't add anything else, other than to say that horror films as we know them now, have their roots in this film (and Re-Animator after that).  Whatever one pays for this package, will be worth it.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|My first BK experience, was the &#34;Magic Potion&#34; album. My son recommended it, and I liked it from the get go. The music was more blues/rock, and it caused me to go back and buy 2 earlier albums, &#34;Rubber Factory&#34;, and &#34;Thickfreakness&#34;. Since then, I've purchased both &#34;Brothers&#34;, and now, &#34;El Camino&#34;, and though I skipped &#34;Catch and Release&#34;, I may get that one yet. My opinion of most bands, is that they're at their best on their earliest albums, especially if they write their own music. This is simply because of their own creativity. Many bands can't keep it up, and tend to fade because of it. The Keys, on the other hand, like fine wine, have gotten better with age. I like how they've transitioned from a mostly blues band, through hard rock, into more of a pop/rock band. I suspect this is the reason for their popularity, and hope they can keep it up for a long, long time.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|If your an Eagles fan, you'll enjoy this Blu-Ray edition of their Melbourne concert. A must-have for any Eagles fan
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app, game whatever is like so awesome u receive so much gems<br />At least try it can you it is kind of awesome
B009KEN87O|4.0|The gamer part of me is stoked to find this fun, fast wave-based invader shooter, with all the right extras: three-axis movement (four if you count invincible mode), good powerups, levels that are challenging without being impossible, good variety of enemies to blast....<br /><br />The working professional family man part of me, not so much.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|It is chaotic<br />Free but ok<br /><br />I also think that it is kind of funny and fun exec<br />-pt the time thing
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|My 11 and 5 year old girls liked it a lot.  They are both Tim Burton fans, so for sure a safe pick if you are too.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Connection kit arrived in original sealed Apple product packaging. Great price works like a charm with my iPad. The connector takes a moment to actually connect to the iPad and recognize the device but pictures transfer smoothly. Quick standard shipping.
B00881VLCE|5.0|fun time.. wish there were more free puzzles tho.. great time playing it.. give it five stars.. a def must have
B000SL1Q2C|1.0|May be my fault but I never saw that this was in Italian. Doesn't do me any good and am having difficulties returning. I know the movie, Ladyhawke, is super, one of my faves, I just want it in english!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|no problems///just what I needed. Was trying to connect LCD TV to stereo amp but amp only had analog inputs and TV only had digital outputs. Was able to connect this conveter to optical output of TV and used a 3.5mm stereo cable to amp. Converter also has RCA L/R outputs. I like the LED idiot lights on the converter that indicate power and valid signal inputs! Heck of a lot cheaper than buying a new stereo......
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|at first it was a lot of fun. when I went to play another game my controls were screwed. it sucks. graphics suck. the whole game sucks and doesn't make sense.
1400032717|5.0|I loved this book. It was a gift from my son.  I had no idea what it was about but have read it twice.  The insight into human nature, the tantalizing elements, the \\"humanness\\" of the characters, their lives, their behavior, the plot line.  It is a joy to read.  And on top of everything else, my understanding of autism increased exponentially
B0030V0PEW|4.0|This has some outstanding examples of how checklists empower organizations in different fields. This seriously changed my approach to my business operation in the Middle East. It has huge credibility and applicability. It's only lack was graphic examples which would have really helped. Otherwise, a super book.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I don't under stand this game I set my alarm at 3:00 and I got up at 6:24 I was very upset I don't know what I should do I'm late. I think I should erase this game or forgive this game for its first mistake.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie. The qualit yis excellent. Shes's only seen it about 50 times so I'm glad I have a high quality version for her continued viewing enjoyment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way better than the first temple run!!!<br />I would get this instead of the first temple run if your a first time person to playing and seeing temple run!!!awesome game!!!
B000002UVX|5.0|This is a great CD. This music is overlooked by commercial radio stations. If you like rock, blues and soul music, you should give this a listen.
B00BHMF578|2.0|Rented when it won best picture - expected something pretty good. Average movie - predictable, overly simplistic, not particularly well acted. Possibly the worst best picture since Shakespeare in Love. Lame.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Let me start by saying I started trying to get my hands on one of these 2 months ago, I had it in and out of my cart several times as I would add it the status would change along with the price from 32 dollars and sold out immediately to 70 dollars and I would hesitate on buying it. I finally scored this beast at 37.99 and in my mind way to cheap for this blade and the quality steel you get. The workmanship and edge on the one I got is perfect and as for breaking it I don't see how you could ever break a quarter inch piece of high carbon steel under any sort of conditions maybe just maybe if ya baton it with a sledge hammer ya might but i still doubt that! Any how if ya can get this knife for less than 50 bucks ya better buy it it is well worth the money.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|This alarm app seems stable and is attractive and functional.  However, there are ongoing popup ads for other apps by Apalon, even after pressing 'no thanks' at least ten times.  Most people will tolerate this because they're conditioned to.  When I pay for an app promising 'no-ads', that's what I expect to get.  What else are they lying about?<br /><br />Yes, I know it's only .99, but a promise is a promise, a lie is a lie.  Companies get by with these deceptions because we tolerate it.  Subsidizing an app with ads for their own products is no different than getting paid by other companies to put ads in the app.  I'll be insisting on geting my money back.  Shame on you Apalon.
1558908846|4.0|My daughter just recently discovered Stallone  through his later movies, so I am slowly finding some of the early ones. I'm saving Rambo for last. Wish he did more comedies, Rhinestone was a hoot.
B004R10L4S|5.0|Im a big fan of the stars of the film. It was well written and well acted. We didnt want to hit pause for any food or potty breaks. LOVED IT!
B000O77SRC|5.0|I have seen everything he's done, what more is there to say? He will still be kicking butt when he's 80. I'd like to see him do some more comedy.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It kind of played on different aspects from Twilight and e energy Harry Potter. This is a must read for all Harry Potter and Twilight fans everywhere!!=)
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I've loved this series since I first started reading it (30 years ago).  All the movies in the series were so well done and this is no exception.<br />Peter Jackson is brilliant.  I look forward to seeing the next two.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|The game is fun, but a little glitchy. It spawns enemies but sometimes spawns only a \\"ghost\\", where the is no enemy there, but the little arrows that tell you where the enemies are leads you to the point where the \\"ghost\\" is, but there's nothing there. You can run around and kill everything else, but that spot remains that you can't do anything with, then your time runs out and it tells you you failed. Also, it comes up under the rpg search and it's nothing more than an arena fighting game.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|It is extremely fun. Also aggravating as all get outs. Trying to get the star before time runs out. I am still trying on level 9
B007N6NGYG|5.0|this game is awesome!!! So fun, and it actually makes you think. More than what I was hoping for - highly recommend!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app. GIVES. YOU THE INFORMATION YOU want or need in an instant.  Also, it is helpful in. Doing some planning for the next few days.
1250006341|5.0|I was very impressed with the outstanding photography and graphic layout of the publication. The text gave much more information.
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|This game is awesome for the price! I highly recommend this game for the arcade hockey enthusiasts or just for the kiddos.
B00867GKIK|5.0|I, previously, purchased this movie on Blu Ray and I loved.  This is not just a children's cartoon but it works for kids.  It tells you all that you need to know about Love, and Life. It shows, the Ups and Downs of Marriage and Life in General.  How, we set goals and do not always reach them because of external factors.  It shows selfishness and unselfishness.  The ideals of saving and putting others first, even when it costs us our dreams. Showing, it is wrong, wanting to just possess things and not thinking about the consequences and harm.  That is just part of the story.  I would say that 3D, as it is done right, makes the movie 100% more interesting. Loving it, start to finish.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|Had no problem with this order. It showed up in plenty of time for<br /><br />Had no problem with this order. It showed up on time for Christmas but had to return it because it was a duplicate gift.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So fun some times annoying when you cannot get new character with all that non sense but it is so fun so get it if you sometimes want nonsense it is good this ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive and my kids love it they always ask if they can go on it. Very good.and it was free too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I personally love this game because it lets me see what my fake horse is doing while I am with my real horse
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|The game is cool. It is so simple an idea, grow bigger. Under that simple idea hides detail, timing, and resource management. The graphics are good if you stay slightly zoomed in. Otherwise it's to small to see detail. Gameplay is fun. Graphics are good. Wish there had been more for the campaign.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very addictive! I love horses so I thoroughly enjoy it. My kids play just as much as I do!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Of all the time management games this one is the best. You never require gifts from friends to proceed, but they can help you out. It starts out fast than starts to slow down in gameplay. It never gets to slow as I can check it six or seven times a day and have things to do. If you are a fan of the movies it's a must try.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I had a motel then it disapeered .<br />I was mad it took me a year to build it . I was crying cause of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I always wanted a horse, now I have one without the cost.  This game has great graphics and keeps me entertained :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lot of people say that it is like temple run but it is not in temple run you tilt and there are different paths instaid of three paths you can take and was fine when I downloaded it.
0374203032|5.0|I think this a great book to read. Before reading this book I was currently reading his pervious book: Justice.Which is why I was interested in reading this book. Michael J. Sandel starts the book off by suggestion crazy ideas for fast cash. I think Sandel made very good points and arguments from chapter 1-5. Especially asking the ethical question \\"Is there anything money can't buy?\\"  I do believe we have become a society where you can put a price tag on anything. Heck you can pay someone to stand in line for you, call your doctor anytime for a hefty price, or if you can't find the right words to say \\"I'm Sorry\\" buy an apology. A lot of those things we do spend money on we accept as a norm when it's not.  I believe Sandel questions people on what and how money is being spent that and how it diminishes the value. It hit the religions area when the story about paying someone to stand in line for the Papal Masses. This book makes you think what are the moral limits of the market? After reading this book my views on society are different and my eyes are open. This book isan very thought provoking through asking the audience questions in every chapter. Sandel provides a detail thought, arguments and questions throughout the entire book. The only chapter I may have not cared for in the book was chapter 2. This is because chapter 2 seemed so drawn out and I felt he could make his point in less words. I also didn't have much a problem with people paying someone to be a line stander or jumping the queue. Like me, a lot of people are impatient and if there is a faster way sometimes jumping ahead is best in those situations. A lot of the stories Sandel mention in the book I was not aware of such as the Janitors' Insurance, naming rights and Death Bonds. I also thought it was interesting how people treat a fine as a fee and then are more willing to pay. In that situation the standard price effect does not hold.  The best thing about this book is that its questions your ethics and moral reasoning. Now I'm not an expert in ethics but I think Sandel made very valid arguments and questions such as distinguishing the two kinds of goods: there things money can't buy (like friendship) and the things money can buy (like kidneys) but shouldn't.  I learned that if you put a price tag on everything it diminishes it value or is Sandel words \\" a monetary exchange spoils the good being bought.\\" I'm not saying everyone should agree with Sandel arguments but as a society we should really questions ourselves about what we are spending on money and are  we degrading or corrupting the value as a result. As a society it seems as we have accepted the market entering into non-market area.Overall if you want a book that is worth reading this the right book.

0807014273|5.0|Over the course of the past 20 years, I've read this book at least 5 times. In my opinion, it's one of the most important books ever written and should be required reading in high school and or college.<br /><br />Victor Frankl recounts the horrendous conditions of living in German concentration camps during World War 2. Frankl had the opportunity to flee to America with his pregnant wife prior to being captured by the Nazis. His decision to remain in harms way was based on his desire to spend his days with his parents and brother, regardless of the fact that being sent to the death camps was a near certainty. While he survived, all of the members of his family perished. Among those he was housed with, nearly all had lost the will to live. Throughout the book he conveys the message that if you have no meaning or purpose in life, than you'll give up when circumstances become unbearable.<br /><br />Frankl managed to survive the mind numbing brutality of the concentration camps by concluding that finding some type of meaning or purpose in the midst of pure Hell, was the only way he would remain alive. No matter how trivial the meaning might be, he managed to endure simply because he was able to translate that meaning into a purpose for living. While those around him gave up, he found meaning by trying to help his fellow prisoners. He would give food away and would constantly tell himself that there had to be a \\"why\\" to his painful and horrendous circumstances. He tells the story of those who managed to survive the brutal circumstances, and those who didn't. Those who did, like Frankl, were able to find a goal and purpose that was outside of themselves. This was the only way that they could go on.<br /><br />Frankl shows us that we can choose our own attitude toward adversity and by doing so, we can transcend life's inevitable suffering. Nothing could be more testing of this theory than living through the atrocities of the Nazis and the almost certain death and suffering of living in a concentration camp.<br /><br />This book, more than any other that I've ever read, clearly conveys the message that all of us are capable of getting through the absolute most vile of circumstances if we simply find a purpose in going on. The Nazi concentration camps presented the most despicable and abhorrent conditions the human mind could imagine, yet those who chose to find the slightest hint of meaning, were those who were most likely to survive.<br /><br />This is a book that you'll want to read over and over again. Frankl, who is known for being a renown Psychiatrist, used his time in the concentration camps to define who he would become. As a Psychiatrist, he presented a theory known as logotherapy, in which he states that our purpose in life is not to find pleasure, but to pursue what we personally find meaningful. He reiterates that what is meaningful for one person, may not be meaningful for another, but this does not matter. All that matters is that we strive to find meaning in our life, regardless of what that may be. If we're able to do so, we'll be successful at surmounting what to some would be the near impossible. During the second half of the book, Frankl discusses logotherapy in depth. After reading his account of the atrocities of surviving the concentration camps, than reading about the principles of logotherapy, you'll never feel the same again. This is without a doubt, a book for the ages.g of living in a concentration camp.<br /><br />This book, more than any other that I've ever read, clearly conveys the message that all of us are capable of getting through the absolute most vile of circumstances if we simply find a purpose in going on.

7500117124|2.0|It shows in the photo, but it should have been clear in the description that this is a bilingual edition! It's distracting if that's not what you're after!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was amazing. And tragic. I knew from the get-go it was going to be sad, but I just couldn't seem to look away.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|My niece had read the book and declared it \\"stupid\\"; I suspect it was the ending that turned her against it.  We're all Ang Lee admirers and were curious, however, so the rest of us went to see it.<br /><br />Gorgeous film; loved the CGI animation.  Fascinated by the tiger-in-your-lifeboat problem, keeping him fed without becoming food.  But it was all undermined by the denouement at the end.  \\"Oh, I made it up to make it more interesting,\\" in essence.  No wonder my niece said the book was stupid.  We all felt let down.<br /><br />The film was still gorgeous and thought-provoking.  Just finally disappointing.
B009KEN87O|4.0|A fun adaptation of a classic.  The game autofires, so controlling the game on a phone or tablet is easy and responsive.
B005RAQRQO|5.0|I love this music!  Give him a listen and you'll be hooked too.  It's feel good, bouncy and uplifting.  As Dick Clark would say, &#34;it's got a good beat and you can dance to it!&#34;
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I'd almost hate to know just how many hours worth of video I've totalled exactly using this downloader, but it has only help make my life better.I can't enjoy watching videos that snag every thirty seconds while streaming online, let alone the adds, and this is where TubeMate has made a huge difference.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am madly in love with Downton Abbey.  This is the very first movie DVD's that I ever purchased.  I have all three seasons and i can hardly wait for Season four.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game seems science-related and the colors are very enhanced.  Great way to pass the time away and has some difficulty.
0316228532|5.0|Loved this book - amazed that the author of Harry Potter (which I also loved) can produce something so totally different, with such completely different qualities. Suspect it may not be popular in the US - it is very British, and displays an utterly depressing picture of modern Britain that is nothing like the fictional delights of Harry Potter and the British Tourist Board. There is scarcely a redeeming feature in any one of the large cast of characters, and yet they draw you in . . . couldn't wait to get home from work to get back to the book and find out what was going to happen next. The writing, the plot, the insights, the characters are all compelling . . . my one hope is that Mike Leigh will do a movie version of it!
B00BYOEZTI|3.0|I'm not a purist, I thought where LOTR deviated from the book it was done to good effect and often brought in material and character background from Tolkien's own notes.<br /><br />The Hobbit movie does not have the same reverence for the source material.  Clearly the makers thought the book story was too boring for modern viewers so they turned it into an action-and-adventure movie with no subtlety or sense of discovery.  Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.<br /><br />The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.<br /><br />If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.  So I'm giving it a 3.  Just don't expect the experience you had with LOTR.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun, interactive game that everyone in the family will enjoy. The graphics and sound effects are realistic. Great app!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I just downloaded this game. What fun it is! The 3D graphics are bright and colorful. Even though l`m not a teenager, as an adult I love a good game as an alternative to the reading I do on my Kindle Fire. Thank you for the fun!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Interesting game.  As you level up the challenge is also more complex.  Makes me think.  Good game for kids to challenge spatial acquity.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This game is more colorful an exciting than the regular Angry Birds App.  More levels and types of birds, also.

B00915G6MG|5.0|I have order all nine seasons and play them over and over, each time I see something that I missed. I can't wait for the tenth  season to be released. I also joint the team by ordering the official NCIS badge,T-shirt(Black W/NCIS on front),cap(Engraved)and all \\"Gibbs Rules\\"magnet. Now I feel like part of the team when I'm watching each show.Loyal viewer for ever!

B0006Z2LH4|3.0|Being a huge fan of the original cube movie, I must say I was not overly impressed with this one.  But it is still worth watching if you are a cube fan.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|awesome this game is the best ever!!!! get it!!!! thrilling and mystery findings!!!<br />GET THIS GAME AND YOU WILL LOVE IT
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Before we get to the review, I have read and reread The Hobbit ...well, probably too many times. J.R.R. Tolkien created a world (well, he actually created a language in need of a world) that has entertained millions. I have have treasured these stories and was a bit hesitant when I heard they were going to be made into a movie because ...well, Hollywood never seems to get it right for whatever the reason (money, ego, quote creative differences unquote, whatever) which is why the book is always better than the movie. However, I can honestly say that I have enjoyed these movies as much as the books.<br /><br />Peter Jackson and his crew have done it again, this time with The Hobbit. (If you haven't seen Lord of the Rings, I highly recommend you do so.) Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf and does his usual phenomenal job - he plays the part extremely well and has this ability to convey paragraphs with his eyes or a simple gesture ...I can't imagine anyone else playing him. Bilbo is played by Martin Freeman who seems to have been born for the part. I won't go into too many details about the other characters, but I will mention Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Ken Stott (Balin) who gave wonderful performances. I had no trouble believing that Thorin and his people were robbed by a dragon.<br /><br />This is the first of three movies for The Hobbit - they've extended the story from the appendices of The Return of the King. From Bag End to Rivendale to ...well, I don't want to have to type 'spoiler alert' at the beginning. Needless to say, The Hobbit takes us to Middle Earth and Peter Jackson makes you believe it really exists. (These movies have also added added the entire country of New Zealand to my bucket list.) The bonus features are interesting and gives us a tyro's understanding of how a movie such as this is made ...the logistics alone are mind-boggling. Make it a point to watch the bonus features at least once.<br /><br />A wonderful movie full of thrills, intrigue, anda bit of backstory make this a must see movie for any fan of a great story, let alone a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien.
B00AJLHULW|2.0|I own 3 other cds by Robben Ford.  Most of them have been pretty good.  I would highly recommend the cd entitled, \\"su p ern a tu ral.\\"  His latest cd, \\"Bringing it Back Home,\\" appears to be a departure from his previous style. Perhaps I just don't understand this latest cd.  It would have been most helpful to listen to music samples prior to purchase.  I would not recommend this cd.
B00338QENI|5.0|So glad to hear Oprah is going to share Henrietta's story. I was shocked to learn of so many medical unethical practices, yet grateful for the medical advances which aide us all. A real eye opener!
B00B1OWEVC|4.0|Purveys a quiet, disturbing, 'warning-like,' near-sneaky sense of threat, dread. A more﻿ pensive, for want of a better term, 'version,' of Reznor's work. As opposed to the more forthright, directly-challenging style of say, 'Near Zero.' Or, of that of my personal favorite, 'With Teeth.'<br /><br />I do love this work, here. Gives one a sense, truly, of standing for, or representing, something larger than a mere, 'album.' Like much of Reznor's work, this has a feel of transcendence to it. As if the recording might well be construed, thought of, as a 'sign of,' our times. Of our modern, 'advanced,' age. And, perhaps, of an imminent, inevitable downfall? Of failing, distracted, mechanized, dumbed-down, largely-oppressed, western Man? ...Yep: I'd say so.<br /><br />Listen with no distraction, for best result.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This is the best adaptation of the classic Charles Dickens book I have ever seen.  I have read the book a few times and this version really does the book justice.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Can't do without my Cloud,great selection of favorite old school and gosple. Best prices also,wouldn't trade it for nothing. No complaints ever.
B009KEN87O|5.0|simple graphics but fun and relaxing to play. i like the multilevel and the ability to resume a level after taking a break.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Everyone in the family enjoys this app. When my husband and I get stuck, we give it to our 9 yr old and she has it solved in 5 minutes.  Great app!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|this game is very fun a few gliches though but overall a good play for all ages give it a try
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Slow download to my kindle fire. Good graphics and smooth play. Very fast paced game that is probably too fast for young children. Got to level six and game crashed. Restarted and had to do level six over. Completed free play and now wants to sell full game. Do not have price so I may not buy.<br />UPDATE Discovered price is $4.99. Too rich for my blood. Uninstalled.
0449011909|3.0|This review is specifically about the quality of the audio book, not the story or Martin's writing.<br /><br />The audiobook's narration weakens an otherwise engaging story. Roy Dotrice is terrible at doing women's voices (he makes many sound stupid no matter how strong, intelligent or powerful) and has turned Tywin Lannister into Winston Churchill. The Churchill accent distracts me so much that I find it difficult to pay attention to the story because I'm so irritated at the trite imitation. If I were British I would find this rather offensive as Churchill is a celebrated hero who held the country together during WWII, and using his voice to narrate the brilliant but nefarious Lannister is just wrong.<br /><br />That said, if you are a fan of audio books during long work commutes, then \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" audio series is definitely for you as each installment lasts 40-50 hours. However, the price is quite hefty so I recommend borrowing it from the library.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Todd is one of the best crime writers out there and with this one he has blown through the high standard he sets for himself. His characters are amazingly real and the way he has developed them is superb. The story has great flow with great story within the story sub plots. You will try to read this in one sitting but try not to because like all great crime stores the genus is in the details. As a retired cop i can tell you that Todd understands how things work. Reading this was like doing a ride along. The information is pulled together piece by piece. When it all comes together you are in for a shock that I did not see coming. All  in all a great story from a master of this genre. You will not be disappointed.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|anyone who is complaining about 'scraping the barrel' and 'nothing new' , please don't buy this cd/lp get the music from some torrent site.This cd is worth its money for the track 'Somewhere' alone : amazing song and excellent guitar work.I am happy to get such good music in excellent sound quality for so little money

B004J80CH0|4.0|Halfaxa is a really good album, but not as great as Geidi Primes or Visions. You can hear the style evolving here, so it isn't as raw or experimental as GP, but it lacks a bit of the polish and perfection of Visions. All the same, Halfaxa is definitely worth purchasing and giving a regular listen to.<br /><br />J.Ja
B007N6NGYG|4.0|Slow download and install on my kindle fire. Good graphics and smooth play.  Some of the routes are challenging and the play is very quick. You have to wreck a lot of trains before you get the hang of which switches need to go in what direction. Sometimes you just cringe when you know a wreck is going to happen and there is no way to prevent it.
B009UWYFFK|4.0|Fast paced and quick witted, this animated film will keep you engaged from front to back with very busy scenes and plenty of back and forth humor. You'll recognize most of the voice-overs and how well they fit the characters. The audio and visuals are crisp and clean and color/contrast is very good. Good movie for all ages.......

B001A4LYN2|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is a remarkable actor who really becomes the character he is portraying.  You never know quite where this movie is going, but you know it's not gonna be good.  Absolutely engrossing tale of a unique human being.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I like the regular site better. The app is too vague. Can't refine all the way down. It's nice when at the store pricing online vs store.
B009KEN87O|5.0|space invaders portable is awesome game my toddler loves it plays it for hours in fact he is throwing a fit right now Bc he wants to play
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|These songs are great but we were told these were all unreleased ones.  But they weren't.  My husband says he has heard some of them before.  He even knew the words.  Doesn't really matter.  The CD is awesome.  There is no-one better than Jimi..
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Great game. New to the persona series, I like it. Slow start but worth it. I reccomend it if you like JRPGs with a lot of social simulation.
1881273377|5.0|Excellent, practical information and easy to listen to.  Totally made sense.  A must read for everyone trying to understand how we are different and what makes us tick.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Especially if you like films by Quentin Tarantino.  Though bloody and violent at times, it's too over-the-top to be construed as anything but movie violence.  I wish these events had actually occurred!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This was a good book but it just wasn't as exciting as the first book. Although I have got to read the last one!
B009KEN87O|5.0|i was hesitant at first to get it but after all the great reviews when it was the free app of the day i knew i had to get it. good thing i got it the same day but it is well worth the price! different type of invaders to destroy some which give out life and power ups to help you along the way! it looks very retro indeed! very well done and will provide hours of game play as it can be addicting!
0767812166|5.0|Love Jeff Bridges. He really is a natural. Acting fabulous, story great. all of it. I watch it over again. Later on they made a TV sequale but it was weak. Nothing as good as the original.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is Josh Groban's best CD so far! It has smooth songs and upbeat ones as well. You can't go wrong with thus purchase.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is generally not the type of book I like to read. I'm more into the suspense/thriller type, but this book was amazing from beginning to end. I just hate I now have to wait for months for the sequel.  Great read!!!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Very good acting but EXTREMELY depressing.  I think this was supposed to be a movie about redemption but most of the movie is too depressing to make the redemptive aspect mean very much.  If you think you would like to have a relationship with or live with an alcoholic, watch this movie first.
B007N6NGYG|2.0|Too many permissions, unresponsive, but fun when it finally decides to work.  I have another app like this that is better without the permissions.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Always on the look out for non linear story telling and experimental movie making, The Tree of Life, is both.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I already had read Les Miserables as a teen, so knew I loved the story.  But hearing it set to music and knowing it was a live performance (though on film) has made it come alive.  I listen to it again and again!
B009WO7NQO|2.0|If I can't play the app give mea refund! I have a kindle fire 2nd gen and it won't let me play it says that it is in my cloud but it is noot. I love the app but hate being blackmailed.
B009E3EY38|5.0|It's great, haven't had a change to watch it but have listened to it.  Recommend it to all interested people.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Although fiction and far fetched, it is plausible and believable.  An easy going read, not overly complex or too many characters.  Satisfying conclusion.  Sorry to have it end.  Maybe it's wishful thinking, but there are some loose ends that leave open the possibility of a sequel.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Awesome movie, plot, and villian. Craig shines in his third movie in the series. No need for the DVD, Blue Ray is nice and crisp.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I'd recommend this book to Robert Jordan fans or other fantasy readers. Characters are multi-dimensional, and progress can be tedious, but the world is a character in its own right. Pace was a little slow, but I'm a fan
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game . It's really fun . You can do all kind of stuff . I hope you love it to .
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Predictable in the plot, but it was a sweet romance.  I do like the stories where the two &#34;accidentally&#34; marry the right person.
0374531269|3.0|Our son ordered this book for a school assignment.  The book arrived really early so he was happy about that.  The book was advertised as &#34;good&#34;, but it was really in &#34;average&#34; condition.  He said the pages smelled bad and were torn.  But the upside is he got the book, and got his assignment done!
B00BF123WG|4.0|I liked it and would recommend to a friend.  Characters were great and, oh yeah, they got the bad guy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down, read it in 2 1/2 days still wanting more, never expected that ending
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We were hooked on the first season after a coworker let us borrow it, we ordered the next season in hopes of watching it during the next weekend (we live in the northeast and were predicted to be snowed in). It arrived on Thursday and we were glued to it all weekend.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Very fun game! My daughter loves these kinds of games. Keeps her entertained for hours. Only took me 10 minutes (actual play time) to complete but stretched out over a couple of weeks it was still nice.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this app is so cool but you have to think A LOT some levels are a breeze others are super hard especially the ones on &quot;when pigs fly &quot;
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this application. It gives you all the information you need about your battery and how much time you would have doing various activities. No technical jargon, just easy-to-use-understand information.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I thought that this movie was extremely well done.  It was a great telling of real events to help us better understand what had happened.  Jessica Chastain was wonderful and definitely deserved the Oscar nomination.  My one complaint would be that some scenes are extremely dark and you cannot see what is happening very well.  Other than that, it was great!
1609611543|5.0|What can you say about a book that can change so many peoples lives?<br />If more people understood the toxicity of flour/gluten, our world would be a little more healthier..<br />From what I understand from my clients, more and more gyms/trainers/crossfit trainers are recommending this book to their clients.<br />Everyone is trying to get one another off gluten.<br />Awesome book. Well written, makes a very important statement.<br /><br />Now..... if he would just write a book to convince congress that GMO and Monsanto are killing us, then we would have a perfect world.....
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is great just needs boats and minecarts and don't get surivlecraft  the game minecraft is so epic and awesome
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|well all i can say about this flop is i'm glad i did not spend 20 dollars at a theater this was the worst james bond i have seen and i've seen them all.
0062014536|3.0|I was very disappointed with this book. It started off great  but when I hit the halfway point I knew it was in trouble. Characters were reintroduced, with a twist or 2 but there was just too much to try and incorporate in this 1 book. There was little or no closure with it's ending, in fact I had more questions than when I began reading it. If I invest in a trilogy I expect to have my questions answered by the end of the 3rd book. It is a shame because the series started off very strong.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It's great  graphics are good and you don't always have to do the story line  You can just fly and shoot webs highly recommended best T rated app<br />EVER!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|I'm really enjoying &#34;The Black Box&#34;; however, I haven't finished it, as I'm reading only about one chapter/day right now.  Am working overtime and just don't have the time for more.  One thing I'm enjoying about this novel is how true it rings.  It's characters and situations seem very believable.  I always appreciate that.  Also, the subject matter is of interest to me generally, as it seems to be to a great many people these days: Cold Cases, that is.  Going back in time with Harry as he tries to solve a 25 year old cold case is interesting, all the little leads that pop up and also the opposition Harry runs into along the way.  Since I'm a native Californian, it's personally made real for me as places Harry travels to in his search for resolution and justice are places I'm generally familliar with.  If you've enjoyed other Michael Connelly novels, I think you'll love &#34;The Black Box&#34;.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have seen this movie 3 times in the theatre and was determined to buy it as soon as it came out on Blue Ray.  The price on this is the lowest I have seen, and includes a LOT.  For fans of this movie, I would recommend buying it from Amazon.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I am refusing to watch this til Christmas. It's a tradition to watch this movie only at Christmas. BUT from watching it in the past it's a great movie. NUMMM NUMMMMMMMMS!!! LOL

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I think I have a new favorite author!  Long time reader of Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Preston & Child, Jim Butcher, to name a few.  Hugh Howey's prose is crisp and clean; the plot line is easy to follow and the character development really makes you feel like you are in the story. There are a couple of surprises that keep you guessing - altogether a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable read.  I am going to be purchasing the follow-up books as soon as I wrap up this review, and then plan to read everything this talented author has written.  Thanks for a good story!!
B00AJER3SE|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.This version is the best so far,so i hope they don't release any new versions for a long time.I want to save money!
B009AMANBA|1.0|Found this movie too long and too boring.  My SO fell asleep and I was fighting to stay awake.  Obviously some people liked the movie, but I have not talked with anyone who did.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|IMO this was a big disappointment,  I wouldn't  recommend this at all or suggest it as a good entertainment movie.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|So pretty and lots of them for the price money. Great colour. My daughter's room looks awesome now. Good choice.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|The cast and the title says it. Should not have to type up a review for this cause OMG it's another classic and the time period just says it all. All the great movies came out of the 80s

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I thought this movie was the best I have seen in a long time.  I had it for three days and I watched it over and over.  It deserves five stars.  The ending was nerve wracking.  What a good movie!!!!!!!!!!!
B004RC8NXI|5.0|So glad I finally bought this movie. It is definitely a favorite of mine and it was received exactly as expected.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|And I thought Smallville was good....this series has a great storyline that links each episode so I wouldn't miss one. It's Good to finally see a superhero series besides the typical Batman/Superman/Wonderwoman......wonder what superhero will be portrayed next.....

B00A0SJWQU|2.0|The original is a classic, going to Mars.  This one has everyone traveling through the Earth's core. I am a Sci-Fi fan, but found this to be quite the bummer.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|its good but the hints don't do much cause I can never find my way around with the hints also its frustrating when you die but you killed the armidillos last lvl how do you defeat him!!
B003B02O7I|5.0|I just love this novel great reading I read until 2:00 am HAD to finish the book will buy more
1451613512|5.0|I watched the series on TV, and wanted to have the book in my bookshelf, to look up how many things we have instigated around the world, come back to haunt us!
B007N6NGYG|2.0|This is mostly trial and error with the added difficulty of glitching occasionally. Trains and/ or their cars sometimes explode for no reason. Like the title implies, maybe skip this one for now, unless you love trains and broken programming.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|My product was posted as DELIVERED by A1 Courier Services, and It further says the following:<br /><br />Status: Delivered<br />Signed for by: Left at Door - Inside Gate<br /><br />I never received it.<br /><br />Normally, when they drop it off, they just pitch the item somewhere cryptic in the yard. Gee, how professional. Now I get NOTHING.<br /><br />This is one of the reasons why completely detest SAME DAY DELIVERY, because the \\"Courier\\" service they use here is two degrees BELOW \\"Detestable\\". I would prefer UPS better. At least it will be delivered. I can't believe I actually PAY EXTRA for this kind of treatment. Can't pin the blame on Amazon.com however, and that's cool. Part of the reason for this is it is a LOCAL business, and this is the only grade of worker you can get in the Phoenix area. No wonder this place is being gutted of its jobs, which are then sent to prison-like labor in China. Useless eaters, here. The LOT of them...<br /><br />I can't give this Blu-Ray any stars because it went MIA and I never received it. I only gave this 1 star because Amazon.com won't let me give 0 stars. Again, the review has nothing to do with the movie, which I saw at the theaters and was worth the price of admission.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An amazing book about an amazing life history. As a long time apple fan, it was interesting to know the details on some of the major products launches as well as about Steve's personal life.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|This device has everything you need in one handy package that is accessible yet not overweight or cumbersome.<br />Good value.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My wife is an avid reader and also enjoys well-done television series.  She has absolutely loved the Downton Abbey series - engaging story lines, great acting and very well done overall.  She can't wait for the next season!
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I got this primarily for my wife - who never seemed to be able to catch all the nuances of this full length feature - when chopped up and edited for TV commercials.  I've since come to realize I'd never actually seen the full movie, either.
1885167776|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is not just about business. It will help you be more purposeful, focused and productive in all aspects of life. We all live lives that are full of distractions. Gary Keller explains how to continue to ask ourselves a focusing question to get to that one thing that will help us get extraordinary results. He says, &#34;Ignore all the things you could do, and do the things you should do.&#34; It sounds easy, but it's not. The concepts in this book give a road map to help us figure out how to use our time wisely. I recommend you buy the book! You'll be glad you did.
B001BANK32|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Stephen King! I've read a run of his books but for some reason I just kept putting reading this one.<br />Well I'm glad I finally got to it. I haven't really read a book I couldn't put down in a while and it was nice to finally experience that again.<br /><br />Love love love Stephen King.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Hugo writes with great flair and deep insight. He uses turns of phrase that seem impossibly modern considering the time frame in which they were written. Apparently there really is \\"nothing new under the sun\\".
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Every episode was amazing! The story line, the characters, everything was great. Everytime an episode was over I would debate staying up late to watch another or wait until the next day. It really hooks you in!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really fun BUT I RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR 11-13 after that age they get really bord with it<br />Thank you for the time it took to read this message to you.!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An unusually gripping tale, of humanity and human nature, locked up in the turmoil of social unrest, betrayal, revolution, ultimate justice, and touching on the very meaning of life.  Masterfully told, adventuresome, and entertaining.  I couldn't put it down.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I bought this blu-ray right when it came out and I can't believe it took me this long to write a review about this master piece. I don't have many words about it because its just that amazing!!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I don't see that is plus calculator is any different than a regular one. Works the same as all others.
B004UPANGM|3.0|Its ok if you like kinda dumb horror movies with no plot.its a kickoff from the video game evil dead that was kool.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Easy way to protect your USB port from being damaged  from infrequent use. I just use the power block that was included with the nexus 10.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|This movie is bad. We could have an in-depth review of why... But to sum it up, the movie is shallow and Kristen Stewart's acting is appalling. If you've seen her acting in twilight (can't speak, face doesn't move, etc) then you've seen what she will do in this movie. There was potential based on the other cast... But she's a giant vortex that sucks it out.<br /><br />My wife and I were really excited to see this and it was a total disappointment.
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|I sometimes like Cohen Bros movies but not this time around.  Good acting, just not my thing.  I love Frances McDormand, that's why I wanted to see the movie;..
B003K1EYM6|5.0|The camera connection kit with 1.00  version firmware is unstable.<br /><br />I have bought a used camera connection kit and it is very unstable. Sometimes it can connect and sometime it can not. Even when it was recognized, the speed is very slow and disconnected after some time, and shows something like \\"device not supported by ipad\\".<br /><br />Then I return the item, and get a new one from amazon directly. The new one works flawlessly. The speed is ok. Watching video directly on a sd card has not any problem. And error message never showed up.<br /><br />I have googled the problem. And I noticed that only the camera connection kit with >1.02  version firmware is stable. My new camera connection kit actually has 1.10 version firmware. Therefore, be careful to buy the used item, and check the firmware version before buying.<br /><br />According to my research, the  firmware should be the key problem. Nevertheless it can not exclude the possibility that it may be a counterfeit product or defective item.
B0036WHM1E|5.0|I love this cd! The songs are poetic in nature and soothing to listen to after a craze work day.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|it is a fun game. Last mission is hard but fun. Any of you who read this, get the app. You won't regret it
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Viewers either greatly admire this Terrence Malick masterpiece or hate it. One thing is for sure and that is that this film needs to be seen more then once. There is no way with a single viewing that one can even begin to appreciate what Malick has achieved with this masterful work. There is very little dialog in the film, but every word is important in understanding the spiritual nature of the film. The Blu-ray disc is state-of-the-art in both picture and sound. I have now ordered four copies of this title and intend to share it with others.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My Grandson wanted this for Christmas (but didn't get it ) being a Grandma I came to the rescue LOL so I wanted it quick and it came so fast and is great for Children.
B007EECSFA|3.0|The book is okay.It's something to read but not a &#34;can't put down&#34; book. The writing is good and characters are well developed.
0064431622|5.0|My almost 3 year old likes this book and I enjoy reading it to him.  I like that we can talk about the picture on each page and he can pick out what &#34;grew&#34; on the chameleon, and I like the message about just being happy with yourself.  I'm glad we added this to our library.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this series! The show is filled with suspense, passion, and action. Not bad for the price either, glad I purchased it.
0007466064|5.0|I've been addicted to the entire Dance with Dragons series from the first book!  It's a splendid tale.  I'm halfway through the final book of the series (the 6th one) and I hate to see it end!
6304712944|3.0|This edition of CAMELOT (I love the art work for the cover) was fine at the time of its release. However the more recent remastering is a great improvement in pictorial beauty over this original release. I love CAMELOT and give the film FIVE STARS. If you care greatly for this film then invest in the more recent issue of the film -- even better invest in the Blu-ray version of that release!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love subway surfers it I  so fun and I love .I do wish there was a way to get more mystery boxes.and I have a question about the 2 times multiplayer<br />.I don't know what that means
B009738XXM|5.0|When I bought this album I already knew some of her work from owl city and other songs on the radio, but when I got the album i was a little afraid that it would not be a good exercise or work album, maybe even a little too bubble gum. I was happy to find that not only did it fit in well in every situation but also left be feeling better for having bought it. No cussing, makes this a good album for the whole family and the up beat nature of the album leaves you happy to leave it on repeat all day long.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie is great. Every time I watch it I tear up. Sarah Silverman does a great job. I think everyone will love this movie, and if you're a game lover like me, there is even more to love all the inside jokes are spectacular. Also the Blu-ray has a great intermission when you pause the movie!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|My boys and I love this game!! It helps them out with weight portions and this helps me with them in the pantry.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Worth it for the classic laughs.  Great cast.  Blu-ray could be better image quality and include more special features about the movie, but for a movie this old, probably not worth the cost to add those features.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Better than Tv. lots of boards makes for fun play. It is easy to le&agrave;rn and quick play. Many configurations to keep you playing.<br />Good sound and colorful tiles. Hours. of fun!
B005FLX1HS|5.0|Big fan of Skrillex and dubstep/brostep/DnB and many forms of electronic music.  Tracks like the Devil's Den have gotten me interested in glitch, and I love Breakin' a Sweat with The Doors and Kyoto just gets me amped.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie was so funny! I could not stop laughing, and loved the whole over protective dad situation. Great for kids and adults alike, I would recommend this to any one looking for a good movie, no matter your age.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|My wife and I saw this movie in the theater after hearing is was pretty good. We were in love instantly, there isn't much to dislike about this movie. I have a great time watching this movie
B008220C38|3.0|Loved the actors in this movie but Joe Wright is a bit over the top as a director. Too much silliness in the beginning,<br />otherwise I loved the scenery, music and acting.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|this app is so good! It allows you to watch videos that the kindle fire normally doesn't let you watch. Also if you want to watch a movie and do something else like play a game or surf the web,  it opens a mini window showing the movie /video while you are doing something else.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|I bought this book after I saw the movie and I had to quit reading the book because it was so confusing.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Delirium has been an interesting series for me. The first book was \\"meh\\" for me, the second one amazing, and the last one quite enjoyable. Of course, in the second book. Ms. Oliver left us with a cliffhanger. I'm sure most of us wanted the book to pick up exactly where Pandemonium left off, but that's not what happens.<br /><br />Requiem begins with Lena and her friends trekking through the Wilds, looking for a safe place after escaping with Julian from the Regulators. I still liked how much Lena had grown up since book one. She's now strong, capable, and independent. However, I didn't like how she treated Julian. I felt that she used Julian as a substitute for Alex. For a book that's about love, Requiem's focus wasn't so much on the love aspect. Though usually I hate love triangles, I really looked forward to this one, because this is actually a love triangle that made sense. But Ms. Oliver didn't really deliver on this aspect of the book. Not enough time was focused on Lena, Julian, and Alex. While we see how Lena felt throughout the book, I wish there were more scenes of Julian and Alex.<br /><br />What Requiem really delivered on was the action. From beginning to end, it never really slowed down. Lena and her group keeps running into one obstacle after another that kept me flipping the pages. Even the Hana chapters, which are my least favorite, had enough suspense to keep me going. I say Hana's chapters are my least favorite because I'd rather have read more about Lena, Alex, and Julian, than about Hana. Reading about Hana reminds me too much of Delirium, which was not my favorite book.<br /><br />Anyway, it's impossible to talk about Requiem without talking about the ending. Personally, I liked how it ended. I can see how to some that it just seemed too abrupt and would feel unfinished, but I thought it suited the tone of the book very well. While it's extremely open-ended, it's about the rising of the revolution. The revolution hasn't ended. Lena's fight is still going, so it's only natural that there wasn't a set ending. Yet, I did feel like the ending was a bit preachy for me. It was almost too philosophical, but it was still enjoyable.<br /><br />Requiem, while it isn't perfect, is a satisfying conclusion to the series. Lauren Oliver's writing, as always, is beautiful. I still think that the concept is flawed, just because I can't envision a future where people would voluntarily give up love, but the delivery of the story is amazing. I would recommend this series, but I think it would be better if you'd just stop after Pandemonium and let your own imagination fill the rest of the story, as Requiem fell quite short in the romance department.ill going, so it's only natural that there wasn't a set ending.

B00001OH1S|5.0|Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack featuring Sting<br />It had a sound quality like brand new.  The entire CD met all my expectations.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Can't really add anything more than what has been said already here..some outstanding reviews that can't be topped! Mr Wilson has given me yet another reason to be inspired by music that is truely creative and worthy of GREAT respect! I certainly hope he can keep it up myself!!
B007N6NGYG|2.0|This game started out nice, but then progressed into ridiculousness. I hope you have four thumbs! It's pretty much impossible to click all the switches in time when they have to be changed at the same time.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is a very good and long experience'  the best one for a good old time<br />You would really like it
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. I have it on my cell phone and it comes in super handy if I need to jot something down and I don't have pen and paper.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Ads are easy to pass with a quick click. Game is fun and an easy way to pass time while having to wait for something. No big deal if you have to quit the game  suddenly to do something else. I like how they added the standings for top 5 at the end of each game. If it annoys you then there is a setting to stop it. I like to see if I can beat the top number of moves.
B005DOKM9M|2.0|Case only un-zips on top and side as shown in picture. I thought it would actually house the unit. It is exactly what it states, a case, and unit needs to be removed to use. I wouldnt have bought this again if I'd known.
B002LLE3Q8|5.0|This 2 CD expanded set is the version I have and having listened to this original KC release hundreds of times since the early 70's I was really hoping to hear a better sounding version....and I have indeed. I have the vinyl and three other CD versions and while still preferring the Vinyl this newer shot at this by Steven Wilson has made me happy to have bought it....it's absolutely the best sounding CD so far and I'm convinced my quest for a final version has been realized. No bloating, no clipping, no harshness...I'm good!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is just super fun and I like the mechanics of the pocket edition. Really easy and fun to play, simple concept that has been executed well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought it was disturbing, but very interesting. Well written. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
1451650728|5.0|This was the best book of the trilogy. I liked David Macks last trilogy better, but it is Star Trek.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|I would love to give this game 5 stars because its fun, challenging, &amp; has good graphics. Buuuut... The movement of the trains is inconsistent. I played the same level a few times, after beating it so I could get 3 stars, &amp; each time I'd do the exact same thing at the exact same time &amp; get a different outcome. I had to press the flag to stop a train as soon as the level started to get the trains to pass each other without crashing, I did that 5 times &amp; the 1st time it worked, the 2nd time the trains crashed at the first intersection &amp; the 3rd time they crashed at the second intersection, which there was nothing I could do between the 1st &amp; 2nd intersection so thats just messed up. The 4th time the train behind it ran into it. Finally the 5th time it worked just like the first time. Each time, I hit the flag AS SOON AS I was allowed to, so it should have done the same thing everytime. To me, something like that ruins the fun of a game because its not really up to me to beat the game, its up to chance.<br />If not for that major problem, this would be a great game. Lots of variety in the levels &amp; the gameplay runs smoothly, no glitches or lagging.
B00BM1AJIO|1.0|I played the free version on my old fire and really liked it.Even though I felt the game was overpriced I bought it anyway.It is buggy and it has no more content than the free one.Maybe it is not designed for the fire 8.9? The weight from the scales hangs in the air and it wont let me use the key to open the door.Ive had trouble with serpent of isis doing the same thing. My Empress of the deep got deleted like I never even bought it. Both games act like they are in &quot;free version mode&quot;.
B007N6NGYG|1.0|I only played up to level 10 and there was a glitch on nearly every level! It is slow, boring and impossible after just a few levels. I would not waste the seven minutes it takes to download the game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Lord is my protection. He bless me everyday. I'll follow his path in order to do the right things.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|What's depressing is that this is actually a REALLY GOOD APP if you're NOT using a Kindle... I was even torn over whether or not I was going to downgrade it based on the Kindle incompatibility. However, the Kindle really needs a 100% free printing app like this one. You not only pay extra for a HP printer that has e-print capabilities, but to add insult to injury, you CAN'T even use it! There are other printing apps that say \\"FREE\\", but after you use them a few times they start asking for money *cough*printbot.printershare.easyprint*cough*.<br /><br />I have an ancient HP printer (one of the early wireless models-C4500) that even my computer sometimes doesn't want to recognize. I have to use its USB connection to print from my PC due to the fact HP never properly updated its wireless software compatibility from XP to Win7. Then, I downloaded E-Print to my phone and VOILA! My printer was instantly recognized and could print wirelessly again! I was super exited about putting it on my Kindle next because I had several projects I needed to print... alas, it was a NO-GO. I ended up purchasing another app that was $10+ to print my documents. The point I'm trying to make is: MAKE THIS APP KINDLE CAPABLE! It's too late for me, because I've already wasted my $$$ on another app... but others could really use an UPDATE for their Kindles!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very good game graphics are really good but game gets slow and you have to quit playing and come back to speed it up
1400069289|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was well written, well researched and well argued with plenty of useful examples and helpful strategies.<br />The explanations about the nature and influence of Habit in our lives was very revealing and provides a mechanism for self improvement and growth.<br />I think that anyone who wants to understand themselves and have more control over their own lives will benefit from reading this book.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Simple old school concept that's a lot of fun to play. Nice call backs to Space Invaders with simple game play.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Great fun but not enough puzzles, not enough variety in the types of pictures<br /> and the puzzles don't have enough pieces. More please.

B00A83075M|5.0|it got here super fast, my kids are in love with the movie and it was packaged very well. thanks so much for the amazing movie :)
1609611543|5.0|We were interested in this subject of wheat avoidance and its effects on our diets.  This book is comprehensive, informative, easy to read, and a great resource.  It does not address the issue of whether the premise has true scientific bases and is really for readers who already believe the assumptions about the dangers of modern wheat.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is sooooooooo fun! I've had it for a couple of months and I'm still not tired of it! There are so many delicious-looking dishes to serve and cute people to watch visit your restaurant! For everyone talking about gems: They are hard to earn, yes, but the game is playable without them! The gems only buy decorations or speed up cooking. This game is very simple to play without spending real money! It's so entertaining. I think it teaches patience as well because the food cooks for awhile before it can be served. There's a very wide variety of dishes to cook/serve. From spaghetti and meatballs to chocolate fondue to creepy monster foods during Halloween- they've got it all! This game is so amazing and great for a FREE APP! I highly recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|This started out as a really great app but I had to remove it because I couldn't get it to stop going off everyday. I did everything I could think of to not have the alarm go off everyday but nothing I did to the app made it stop so... bye bye Alarm Clock!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Finally a game that makes you think!  It is so much fun to work through the deceptively simple puzzles.  You can easily waste moves if you don't think ahead.  The music is so relaxing.
0688156819|5.0|I ordered this along with a set of Tim Burton Toys and wasn't disappointed.  I knew a couple of the stories, but not all and if you're a fan of Burton, this book should be part of your collection.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|First of all, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie 'cause all of the horror movies now aren't that good. But this one WAS good! It was creepy as can be, it was twisty, it was different, it was unexpected and it had me on the edge of my seat!!! I thought it was good enough to call it original. And with the whole Mr. Boogie guy, HE really creeped me out! The back story of it was scary and intriguing... This movie creeps inside you and gets you where it's most uncomfortable! Knowing it's fake is the ONLY thing that saves you....... DO NOT SHOW THIS TO CHILDREN, OR ANYONE WHO GETS DISTURBED AT A MOVIE LIKE THIS, OR IS FRIGHTENED BY THE OCCULT, OR ANYONE WHO HAS NIGHTMARES OFTEN. Bottom line, it's a good movie.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game! It's so fun and the animals are too cute! You get to build up your city, complete goals, and care for your pets while earning more! It's a pretty tricky game once you collect more than two pets because they require attention, grooming, treats, etc. I'm really enjoying it so far. I definitely suggest it for anybody who plays with Littlest Pet Shops or anyone looking for something cute to play! :) Enjoy.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I hate it! They bombard you with ads at random points during the game and it interferes with gameplay. I get that it's ad-supported but could you at least put the ads in between games instead of during them?
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|There are \\"better\\" versions coming out later! I own two sets of the LOTR gift boxes (one to store away for future value) and one to watch and display.

B0074VA2T2|4.0|My 2 yr old son likes this app, but it seems he gets bored with it rather easily, but it could also just be that he's a 2 yr old! I like how it grows with the child in difficulty. All in all, I think it's a keeper and I would recommend to other parents.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I first saw Mayer Hawthorne on Daryl Hall's internet music show called Live From Daryl's House. He has a fun, refreshing sound (actually a retro sound) that is really catchy and will have you singing along, snapping your fingers and dancing where ever you are(at your desk, in the car, down the hall).  No kidding, his music makes you that happy!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|If you like super mario bros and don't want to spend the money to buy the game, this is a great option. It's really fun for when you're bored and the house with nothing to do.

I LOVE the soundtrack. I HATE Russell Crowe but I LOVE LOVE LOVE this version.<br />It is an accurate portrayal of the stage version plus one extra song that you really don't mind...that much ;)<br />My husband liked Russell Crowe in this I was still..meh..good thing everyone else was so fantastic that I did not care of Crowes lackluster performance.

0143122061|5.0|I enjoyed his somewhat balanced analysis in this book. This book is an attempt to narrow down six factors that made western civilization more powerful and successful than eastern civilization. Unlike other traditional historians I have read, Nial Ferguson distribute his focus on both side, good and bad, neglected and overemphasized. I think those six factors he deduced from his observation and research are reasonable and helpful. I agree that western world's brutal systematic extortion on \\"third world\\" with their sophisticated institution and technology, in the hypocritical name of \\"salvation\\" has been nothing but civilized. The old glory was based upon blood and scream, legalized betrayal on trust, manipulation of naivete of unguarded \\"third world\\". Nonetheless, I agree on author's claim that six factors have set western civilization apart from others. I just cannot see same factors reviving the old western glory back. Personally, I believe beneficial adaptation of advancement of knowledge and technology into every day human life has been the hidden steering wheel of our history. Collapse or deterioration of ethics and value, and destruction of family system, obviously has been the foretelling signs of coming social and economic crisis in civilization. As always, it's the small things that matters. As for this book, it was entertaining and enjoyable. I would recommend.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|A big improvement over Season 2.  More action and I really like the confrontation between the two groups.  No one seems safe so you never know if your favorite character will make it to the next episode.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The animation is awesome in this, and you can tell, if you understand the process of animation. The music provides a serious, almost suspenseful mood with the dark and mystical images of this story. It's very non-Disney-like, and I like this movie due to that reason. I'm so grateful I have this film.
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|Enough already.  Was there a plot in that orgy?  A bit vile.  I was very disappointed.  Sex, violence, horror, perversity.  I thought it was getting pretty sick.
B00BJW6YW6|5.0|This album caught my ear and captivated me the whole way through, and I fall in love again with every listen. The sparse instrumentation of most of the songs draws you in to their quiet yet powerful world... the vocals are beautiful, emotional, softly intense.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Best hidden object kindle game ever.  Challenging,yet exciting it's the best one u have played since I got my kindle.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I went back and forth on this game as to whether or not to give it 3.5 or 4 stars.<br /><br />The free play really isn't to write home about, fun a few times but not something to play repeatedly and all you get is the one cube design.  Other match making games, while offering the same repetitive game play find ways to make it fun and interesting.<br /><br />On the other hand, the more competitive modes were more rewarding. There's one mode that gives you one minute to to make as many matches as you can and another mode that has you making as many matches as you can while the cube builds itself up (instead of starting with a full cube) and ending when the cube is fully formed. These two game plays are more interesting and offer a challenge that makes you want to play the modes several times.<br /><br />There just seems to be something missing out of this game. It is a good idea, I like the idea of a 3D matching game and spinning the block is seamless. Yet, while I am not one who is usually bothered by graphics, there is something about these that both strains the eyes a little bit after playing for a while along with just feeling sort of there. The music offers that same blah feeling, it's there but not doing a whole lot, and I think the combination of these two makes me feel like there's not a whole lot offered by this game.<br /><br />For Kindle Fire HD users it does respond well and the cube turns well, it is easy to select blocks, even blocks close to the center to match and the graphics are sharp.<br /><br />In the end, I went with a 3.5 - it's a fun little game to play to kill 5-10 minutes, such as in a waiting room, but in the end I can't see myself really playing this a lot or even very often. Even now, I don't have any desire to go back and play more of it and don't see myself playing it again in the near future outside of showing it to someone. That doesn't mean I won't ever play it, but it seems more like something I'd take off the Cloud and dust off fromtime to time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was fun and awesome I would like if everyone were able to try it because my lil bro loved it and it was awesome

B000MMBRJY|1.0|There is one thing genuinely scary about \\"Boogeyman 2.\\" That would be that the first three words onscreen are \\"Ulli Lommel Presents.\\" Lommel has made some terrible films (Don't believe me? Check out \\"Revenge of the Stolen Stars.\\") but this one is among his very worst. (As a caution, there are two films of this name and this review is for the 1983 release, not the 2007 movie.) It is highly derivative and highly boring. The script is awful, and the acting worse. Lommel stars against Suzanna Love as Lacey, a young woman haunted by her past and the gruesome deaths of her family and friends.<br /><br />While the film is sadistic, it is also incredibly plodding and fails to chill on any level. While the film allegedly stars John Carradine, be advised that he is in it as a dour psychiatrist for maybe five minutes. It's a shame, as he turns in the best performance in the film (not that that's saying much.) The plot revolves around a house where murders occurred years ago. There's a mirror that witnessed the killings and little pieces of it possess people and objects to bring more death and destruction. I will not bore you with details, but the following is a non-exhaustive list of murderously possessed items: scissors, electric hedge trimmers, a window frame (not the glass part, you understand,) a medicine cabinet, a can of shaving cream, and my personal favorite, a toothbrush. Bonus points go to Lommel for the most ridiculously deadly French kiss in history.<br /><br />The \\"Exorcist\\" and \\"Amityville Horror\\" influences are obvious, but the film is clearly not in the same league. The film centers on B-movie personalities in Hollywood, where Lacey confronts her past while the cast gets thinned out. The film has poor sound and lots of annoying directorial choices and camera work (the closeups of children's toys in the dark, etc.) that utterly fail to create suspense or horror. The film winds down with a jarringly quick, but wholly ridiculous conclusion involving a convertible in the desert with three unlikeable cast members in it. I couldn't help but think of the parallel sequences in \\"Manos, The Hands of Fate,\\" but \\"Manos\\" is a much more enjoyable movie.<br /><br />Even John Carradine's most devoted fans may want to steer clear of \\"Boogeyman 2,\\" surely one of the most trying horror films of his career to endure. You have been warned.in the desert with three unlikeable cast members in it.

B0096PAA6E|5.0|I hate to admit this, but I didn't know about Gary Clark, Jr. until I happened to hear \\"When My Train Pulls In\\" in a music store one day and asked a salesperson about it. I bought the CD on the spot, and what a great decision that was. \\"Blak and Blu\\" is a tremendous album with an amazing diversity of styles and influences. While I freely admit to liking the heavier blues-influenced guitar intensity of songs like \\"Numb\\" and \\"Glitter Ain't Gold\\" over some of the other genres present here, there is nothing bad on the album. After listening to the CD several times, the highlights for me are still \\"Numb,\\" \\"Glitter Ain't Gold,\\" and my favorite of all, \\"When My Train Pulls In.\\" These three get very heavy play in my house, and I think they are all outstanding from a writing and performing viewpoint, particularly highlighting Clark's guitar virtuosity.<br /><br />I was interested in the collaborators Clark had on this effort: people as diverse as Doyle Bramhall II (\\"Glitter Ain't Gold\\") and Gil Scott-Heron (\\"Blak and Blu\\") are represented here (there's even an excellent Hendrix reinterpretation!) and while the album is better for the occasional collaborations, make no mistake this is Clark's show.<br /><br />Clark's guitar is blistering at times and incredibly subtle at others; his vocals likewise range from gritty to velvet smooth. He's a real talent and I am looking forward to more from him in the future. I highly recommend this album.

0385349947|4.0|If Sheryl Sandberg wanted to open a dialog about postmodern feminism then mission accomplished, as \\"Lean In\\" has certainly spurred that, along with provoking a number of detractors who have slammed her even before reading what she had to say.  That Sandberg's book had so much exposure even before it was released speaks to the power of what she has to say, and believe me, she has a LOT to say!  That critics have largely engaged in ad hominem attacks on her rather than her ideas should tell you that what she articulates has merit.  And while that's undeniably true, if a man had written a similar book, would there be such hue and cry?  The answer is no, there wouldn't be, which tells me that Sandberg has touched on a very raw nerve, and her critics rather ironically prove a point that she makes in the book.  Sandberg points out how women will often attack the character of a woman who becomes successful.  My own assessment of what Sandberg puts forth is people are discomforted by her rejection of the notion that our socio-cultural norms are to be blame for women being held back and that it is women who need to change how they see themselves and their multiple roles, how they view society and interact with it.  That is admittedly a bold assessment and one that will undoubtedly upset many readers.  From Sandberg's perspective women sabotage their own career advancement opportunities, relegating themselves to passivity as a rule and questioning their own capabilities rather than demonstrating them and promoting their accomplishments.  Rather than pushing for career advancement women are tentative and hold back on pushing for promotions, raises, and a position they feel they may not be fully qualified for.  Many women \\"leave\\" work mentally before they actually take a maternity leave as contemplation of starting a family takes precedence over taking on more responsibilities and career advancement.  Granted these are generalizations Sandberg makes, but certainly we all know more than a few women at work who fall into these categories.  That's not being misogynistic, that's recognizing what we see and the failure of many wormen to recognize and process this objectively is what not only holds them back, but re-enforces that stereotype.  And Sandberg doesn't solely take women to task for their shortcomings; she offers a pretty withering critique on the escalating costs of childcare, the rampant objectification of women by men, and the \\"benevolent sexism\\" of the workplace.  Coming 50 years after Betty Friedan's iconic \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" what Sandberg isn't as provocative or ground breaking.  Yet I really like a lot of what Sandberg says here and I know that her heart is true, but \\"Lean In\\" becomes a \\"journey of one\\" that for many women is hard to venture on.  For all the books written on the failure of men as of late I can't help but wonder if the dynamics aren't changing and within a few years more women might assert themselves in more dynamic ways and perhaps come rule the roost?  In the spectrum of feminism I'm not entirely sure where to put Ms. Sandberg, but I know this is a very important book in the overall cannon on the subject!ore than a few women at work who fall into these categories.

Just a FUN MOVIE.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|We viewed this after viewing the clunker, A Haunting in Salem, which was horrible. (see separate review on Amazon.) This was much better, though a bit slow at times. It is a haunted house film, a bit like Paranomal activity, except this film doesn't involve demons or ghosts. It does make you think and wonder about what is going on in it. Ethan Hawke does a good job as the crime writer getting scared to death while trying to write the best true crime book he has ever written. Someone should have told him to be careful what you ask for, as he gets more than he expects with this on. First of all, this man moves his family into a house where the entire family was hanged and one of the children is missing without telling his family about it. Shame on him. It's not a slasher film.<br />Overall, I recommend seeing this one at least once, but don't watch it alone, and make sure you keep the lights on. There are some pretty jump out at you scary moments in this film. Whatever you do, don't let your kids watch it with you: Tthey will have nightmares.

B00AQB2A3I|3.0|While I prefer the music of the now indefinitely (and disappointingly) shelved Porcupine Tree, I really did like Steven Wilson's second solo album, Grace for Drowning.  I wouldn't really try to call his solo music 'progressive rock' as both the second album and this one are more jazz fusion than anything else - more specifically he's been trying to capture jazz fusion from the 70's.  There's nothing wrong with that as long as it doesn't sound forced.  Whereas GFD was extremely well written and had a great flow to it, this album sounds too contrived and forced.  Also, the version of Luminol that's on the album sounds too incomplete to me and Holy Drinker makes me cringe because its main groove is like 50 other 70's era songs.  I do like Pin Drop a lot, though, and Steven Wilson remains a terrific song writer and has assembled a cast of amazing musicians.  However, this album is largely forgettable to me and doesn't compel me to listen to it a lot.

There was something strangely appealing about those videos--and they stood out against the other early videos. Then, at age 10, came \\"Let's Dance\\", \\"China Girl\\" and \\"Modern Love\\". Again, interesting videos and music. And so on, and so forth. Now I have all of his albums. For me, his 'blue period' began with 1989's \\"Tin Machine\\" and ended with 1999's \\"Hours...\\" I revisited all of Bowie's albums again prior to listening to \\"The Next Day\\" and I still have a hard time getting through that 1989-1999 period.<br /><br />So, anyway, \\"The Next Day\\". A homage to his past? Sure, look at the alterations made to 1977's \\"Heroes\\" cover. Producer Tony Visconti is here again (just like \\"Heroes\\"). The nod to a possible alternate past--\\"The Next Day\\" perhaps what might have been to follow \\"Heroes\\" instead of 1979's \\"Lodger\\"? Or maybe a missing link between \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Lodger\\" from 1978? I get it. Clever, Bowie, clever.<br /><br />Let's get down to brass tacks here. Bowie is 66, and most rockers aren't rocking anymore at that age. Not true for Bowie. I like it when a senior doesn't run out of gas in their later career. It's been 10 years since Bowie's last album, 2003's \\"Reality\\". He doesn't reinvent the wheel here, instead, Bowie does Bowie, but he does it well. Now here comes the arguments....\\"The Next Day\\" isn't as good as \\"Heathen\\" or \\"Reality\\". Just my opinion, but after multiple listens to \\"The Next Day\\", it's a good album, but not as good as \\"Heathen\\" or \\"Reality\\". Now, if you're somehow able to 'forget' or 'block out' Bowie's past albums (which I don't know how you can do that) then I suppose in a vacuum, \\"The Next Day\\" might be five stars, but I have a memory like an elephant, and I can't bring myself to give it five stars. Four will have to do. The album hangs together well, but there aren't really any singles to be found.<br /><br />In fact, there are some good songs here, but nothing that I felt could be a 'hit'. To me, there were hits on \\"Heathen\\" and \\"Reality\\" (as well as many other Bowie albums), but this is one of those that just flows well without having a hit on it. That's fine, nothing wrong with that, but I'm old school, and I believe there should always be one or two 'hits'. I suppose you could argue the title track is a hit, or \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\" is a hit, or \\"(You Will) Set The World On Fire\\"--all of those are immediate, urgent, catchy. Maybe you could pick \\"Dirty Boys\\", \\"Where Are We Now?\\" or \\"Boss Of Me\\".<br /><br />But what about the weaker tracks here like \\"If You Can See Me\\" or \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" or \\"Valentine's Day\\" or \\"How Does The Green Grass Grow?\\" Perhaps the album didn't need to be 14 tracks? Perhaps some trimming and tightening would have made the album sharper and more focused? The three bonus tracks are good, but they neither enhance or mar the overall package.<br /><br />\\"The Next Day\\" is still a good album, just not a great one, and that's all right, I'd rather have Bowie than not have Bowie, and Bowie on a bad day is still better than thousands of other artists on a good day, but I want to make it clear that this review is critically examining \\"The Next Day\\" not just rabidly and blindly adoring Bowie. I respect him as an artist, but \\"The Next Day\\" isn't something I'd rave about to others. I'd tell anyone to have a listen, that's it's worth listening to, and if you're a long time fan, you should like it. I don't understand the one or two star reviews, especially if they are really fans of Bowie's music.<br /><br />So, here's how \\"The Next Day\\" compares to Bowie's other albums [insert gasps and arguments from rabid Bowie fans here]:<br /><br />1967 David Bowie: One Star<br />1969 Space Oddity: Two and a Half Stars<br />1970 The Man Who Sold The World: Three Stars<br />1971 Hunky Dory:Four Stars<br />1972 The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars: Three and a Half Stars<br />1973 Aladdin Sane: Three Stars<br />1973 Pin Ups: Two Stars<br />1974 Diamond Dogs: Three Stars<br />1975 Young Americans: Three Stars<br />1976 Station To Station: Three and a Half Stars<br />1977 Low: Three Stars<br />1977 \\"Heroes\\": Five Stars<br />1979 Lodger: Four Stars<br />1980 Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps): Five Stars<br />1983 Let's Dance: Five Stars<br />1984 Tonight: Two and a Half Stars<br />1987 Never Let Me Down: Four Stars<br />1989 Tin Machine: Two and a Half Stars<br />1991 Tin Machine II: Two and a Half Stars<br />1993 Black Tie White Noise: Two and a Half Stars<br />1995 Outside: Two and a Half Stars<br />1997 Earthling: Two and a Half Stars<br />1999 Hours...: Two and a Half Stars<br />2002 Heathen: Five Stars<br />2003 Reality: Five Stars<br />2013 The Next Day: Four StarsFour Stars<br />1972 The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars: Three and a Half Stars<br />1973 Aladdin Sane: Three Stars<br />1973 Pin Ups: Two Stars<br />1974 Diamond Dogs: Three Stars<br />1975 Young Americans: Three Stars<br />1976 Station To Station: Three and a Half Stars<br />1977 Low: Three Stars<br />1977 \\"Heroes\\": Five Stars<br />1979 Lodger: Four Stars<br />1980 Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps): Five Stars<br />1983 Let's Dance: Five Stars<br />1984 Tonight: Two and a Half Stars<br />1987 Never Let Me Down: Four Stars<br />1989 Tin Machine: Two and a Half Stars<br />1991 Tin Machine II: Two and a Half Stars<br />1993 Black Tie White Noise: Two and a Half Stars<br />1995 Outside: Two and a Half Stars<br />1997 Earthling: Two and a Half Stars<br />1999 Hours...: Two and a Half Stars<br />2002 Heathen: Five Stars<br />2003 Reality: Five Stars<br />2013 The Next Day: Four Stars
0786856297|5.0|This is a great book for young and old readers.  I read alot of fantasy and really like this series.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is one of the best fantasy authors of our time. The Emperor's Soul is a great read. Interesting.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it is just like the older one because it's just that the monkey is big er and their is a new place to run
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|big mooncake was supposed to be fixed wth the update but mine still does not work. yes I have achieved all stars and eggs. it does not allow me to play
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I like the play along section, but the music is a little advanced for such a small keyboard.  You can only play one hand (right or left) with the play along selections.  On the kindle fire the keys are too close together to play or learn easily.  I would recommend it for anyone who has keyboard experience and wants  something to tinker with.
B003ZYU3T6|4.0|While the music track along with the film isn't actually the original, it didn't detract from the overall experience. And yes, the video quality IS very good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how it challenges your mind and hands to see how smart and speedy they are. LOVE IT! Recommend it to ANY age! buy it!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Excellent game fun,exciting,surprising you never know where the jumps are or when you have to go under the bench or jump on the train .
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love it, love it, love it! Passes time while commuting to work on the train or just relaxing at home. Never get tired of it as it's always challenging.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I am a new reader of Child, and am reading \\"Killing Floor\\" right now. I wanted to read the Jack Reacher novel's, but after reading this review and into my first book, I think that I will stay with Vance and Mitch. Child is too slow in the story line and you want to skip ahead to see where he is going. Thanks for the review, I will take this author off my read list.<br />Jon W. Bice
B007HJ96NO|2.0|The \\"short\\" two hour five minute version of this film makes no sense whatsoever. The first 3/4 is superbly written, acted, and executed; whereas watching the last 1/4 feels like someone has their finger on the fast forward button. I didn't know upfront that there were two verison. In this one, key plot points are omitted leaving the quite-invested viewer bewildered.<br /><br />A multi-facet film, Cinema Paradiso is one man's hell and another's heaven, a tale of a man disappointed by his own life trying to live through anothers and living someone else's dream, a story of life choices, and the whether we take that 99th step to pursue happiness. Love how the changing Cinema Paradiso parallels Salvatore's hopes and dreams.<br /><br />\\"The additional 50 minutes of footage provides closure for the saga's detailing Alfredo's death, and Salvatore Di Vita's relationship with his teenage love, Elena. Most of the 50 minutes serves as a continuation of the story, rather than as previously deleted scenes.\\"<br /><br />Skip this over-editted version and get the full-version: [[ASIN:B00007G207 Cinema Paradiso - The New Version]]<br /><br />PS - Amazon needs to split out the reviews of the different version of the film!! One is a five star film and the other a horrible disappointment.

B00000FC5H|5.0|I bought this cd form Amazon because it reminds me so much of the 70s disco era.<br />That era was so fantastic with music that could last. Earth Wind and Fire is a wonderful fantastic group.<br />Like i said disco out and buy it from Amazon.
B00000ITOY|5.0|I bought this for my 2 yr old autistic son to help improve his fine motore skills. The pieces have to be matched w/ the coordinating pegs.
B00867GHS8|5.0|The film is great family film made better with a brilliant 3d conversion.Being a UK customer the package being a region free package was a bonus and worth every penny.If you haven't got a 3d television and blu-ray player I suggest you get one, as a his makes it worthwhile.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I like this movie, but there is much that I don't recall from the book. Yes, most movies stray from the books they are based on, but usually they don't just make things up - in this instance to make the movie flow towards the LOTR movies Or filler so that one book could be made in to three movies? IDK  I really like it though, watch it you'll be glad you did, just don't expect it to be exactly like the book, I guess that's what I was expecting.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle has a unique beautiful voice. Combining it with a song and Michael Crawford was perfect. Would love to see her perform live.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|I was really looking forward to this album, but I now regret pre-ordering it without listening to it first. Had I done that, unfortunately I never would have purchased it. Ever song seems to sound exactly the same.<br />I can't find much that's redeeming about it. Certainly not much of a range. Here's hoping he matures a bit on his next venture, In the meantime, I passed this CD off to my 14 y/o niece who loves him regardless. That seems to be his strongest demographic despite how long he's been in the business.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works great, accurate to description in  advertisement. Was looking for a simple clock for my Kindle Fire hd and found it also has weather as well. Win Win !
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|I feel so bad for the, too squeamish, unsuspecting people that are having nightmares. As I am!! 53 y.o. It's Noah's Ark & the Titanic going down at once, and considerably more graphic & disturbing. When the Zebra gets hurled from the ship, slammed into the small boat, injured, and the Hyena proceeds to make a meal out of him, I'm TOTALLY FREAKED OUT AT THIS POINT. I am heartsick after watching this. This is not for the young or anyone that can't watch the 3 min adopt/donate commercials for shelter dogs. (I have 3 rescues, can't afford more, and it breaks my heart I can't save them all). I donate as much as I can.  Apparently, it won some awards, many awards, I didn't watch. The tiger/hyena/zebra animation, that was ridiculously obvious, did not buffer to gore factor. Anyone else blindsided by the story line and/or the less than believable animation??
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever pretty good game I really loved it I wish I could play it more often it is a lot of fun
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great remixed retro game that runs very well on the Fire. Touch controls are easy and there is enough variety to keep it interesting. Well worth $3
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This is the very first album i owned as a kid.  I loved it then, i still love it.  My mom joined a record club, album of the month deal, she listened to country music. 1 month, she allowed me to pick the album i wanted. i chose Boston's debut album immediately, their only album out at the time.  I was thrilled when it arrived.  Played it long and loud. my dad was not so thrilled.  my mom defended immediately.  He yelled to turn it down, she refused and said, &#34;you can't turn it down, it only sounds the best when it's turned up loud&#34; !  Boston rocked then, and it still does.  Thank you Boston for the memories, then and now.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was a more absorbing read than I anticipated. It sounds like a simple premise. A a man is stranded on Mars and has to survive on his own. Well the logbook format is clever and keeps the reader interested. There is also humour and mild coarse language both of which is appropriate to the story<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the story and even laughed out loud a couple of times.<br />Great read for scifi fans who enjoy straight forward scientific stories.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the series. It had its weak moments but I was engrossed from the start. Had a hard time putting it down.
0763644765|5.0|One of those books that you don't really expect to be such a wild success, but toddlers love. Great undies illustrations.
B003QSMC18|5.0|Recommend for all ages particularly kids.  Good story line.  Entertaining to say the least.  Enjoyed it.  Would recommend.  Good luck
B006YXTRHY|3.0|It is a movie in the Twilight Saga.  It has a decent story, not the best acting, but entertaining none the less!
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I really enjoyed this picture. It was beautiful in scenery & charming personalities.<br />There are not many movies on Victoria showing her grow into the Queen & her romance with her one true love.
B000002AVF|5.0|No one sets the mood like Mariah this is one of my favorite cd will safe guard it so I don't loose it again.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|If you like mazes, this is a game for you. You get to build them with a variety of pieces with special features.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This product is exactly as described.  It is so handy to have while taking walks.  I put my cell phone, water bottle & doggie bags in it.  Plus, my daughter's sippy cup can fit too!  Its really great.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Started slow at first, in ways kind of kwirky.  Provided a strong story of courage, faith and endurance out at sea.  I did not prefer the ending, as changing up his story when he told  to the inspector to save face.  Yes I would watch it again and advise for others. Because of the tremendouse effect of survival.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I am amazed at how well this series was made and I have watched it many times. I am very glad that I added it to my collection of movies so I can watch it again in the future.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I've seen the performance on PBS, not once but three times, and each time I was breathless.  Now I owe a copy and gave one to a  dear friend to experience and enjoy, just as much as I did and will, over and over again.
B0045XICB2|3.0|It is a movie in the Twilight Saga.  It has a decent story, not the best acting, but entertaining none the less!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I ended up buying all the other ones too.  I display them in my living room and when people come over, they gravitate towards them and then can't put them down.  They are a challenge but a fun one!
B007N6NGYG|4.0|This looked like a good FAOTD for this old model railroader, and my grandkids like trains also, and I'm only 100 yards or so from a rail crossing that is very entertaining when 70 hoppers of coal come barreling through on occasion.<br /><br />After installing I verified that it would run without a connection to the internet, which is my first criterion for any game. Fail this test and the game is immediately deleted.<br /><br />Others have expressed great concern about permissions for this game claiming it accesses your Amazon credit card. I don't see anything in the list of Permissions that is a problem. Perhaps others can explain it more fully as I'm still a beginner in Android. The permissions I see on my KFHD8.9 are<br />Storage<br />Network communication full internet access<br />Phone calls read Kindle state and identity<br />System tools prevent Kindle from sleeping<br />Network communication view network state, view Wi-Fi state<br /><br />The game is another track switching game like Trainmania Lite, but with beautiful 3-D graphics that will make it far more interesting. It remains to be seen how it plays. But I don't see any obvious reason not to experiment with it while it is free.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|this came broke my first kindle never ever get it if you want to break you freaking ding dong  kindle
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this last book in the Hunger Games trilogy did a good job of bringing the story to a conclusion without it being totally predictable.  The conflicts that come about through relationships were realistic.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has read the first two books.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is much better than the first one, and having more heroes to chose from just makes is all the better
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like how it is fun and expensive. Kind of realist. Makes me want to ride but it is too cold outside.
6305428352|5.0|I like this movie for its message. The main character has to sacrifice (or at least put on the back burner) his dreams. A good storyline of how a person can affect others' lives and not even realize it. I also like the struggles this musician has with having a deaf child. Once he understands his son better and accepts him for who he is, their relationship with each other and their lives change. Loved the ending!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|warm hearted story of people to whom I can relate, told at conversational level with no lecturing on morals, personalities etc. excellent insight into parts of academia and the unusual folk who can drift into it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a fast paced well thought out story. I would recommend this to teens and adult readers. I hope she continues to write more in this storyline. FANTASTIC !!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is one of the books I recommend everyone to read. I love the simplicity of the story but it tells such an important life lesson. Coelho is a great story teller. I recommend all of his books. Life becomes happier and easier after you read this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This the most best surfing game I ever had it is a good deal for free but you will get ran over a lot it's just like temple run but easier
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I love it!  The only problem is that the sticky adhesive doesn't work, but it never does.  We put it a closet and it lights it up so well.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|Wow. This was definitely one of the best halo mega block sets ever! The characters were extremely detailed,and the setting provided a good story,plus I could put the forerunner thing on other plates!
B002W5UVSM|3.0|Funny and frustrating. I am glad I read it because so many people were talking about it. Such a twisted ,Ani character that causes chaos everywhere he goes. The story annoyed me but it is such a unique and creative story.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|So I, like everyone else, was pretty pumped to have JT back on the airwaves and just dominate like he tends to do. But I must admit, I had my qualms about what to expect with this new album after JT's been out of the game for 7 years! It's tough to try to come back out of that time and be relevant again with an audience who's just moved on to other (maybe better) tastes and such.<br /><br />And after having heard Suit & Tie, I must admit, I was like \\"ehhhh, I don't know about this one too much.\\" Not that I hated it or anything, it just wasn't an A++ in my book; it was good, but not enough. So I was fully expecting much of the same throughout the album, but boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I heard most of the album when it got leaked online and it was floating all over tumblr, so I just had to take a listen. It pretty much surpassed my expectations by a million and I'm so happy that it did because it is a truly amazing album. This is the first JT album that I love in its entirety; each and every song has something that I just cannot get enough of. I can listen to one song from the album and I have to listen to the whole thing because I JUST HAVE TO! I bought the album the day it was released, ON VINYL no less and it's been on repeat ever since! I truly enjoy each song from this album and JT just outdid himself with this one and, wow... I'm in love.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give it listen because you won't regret it!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|So often books don't wrap things up at the end.  This one did, but still left you wanting more.  Great series of books.

0812993357|3.0|As an artist, I've always been fascinated by the world of fashion and mingled in it during my early 20's.  Therefore, when I found this book by Grace Coddington, the Creative Director of American Vogue magazine, I thought it would be very insightful and a great source of historical information.  I was somewhat disappointed.  There is a lot of fashion world name-dropping throughout the book, but there is not enough substance given regarding their contributions to make it of any value to most readers.  I also found this book very slow moving and lacking in emotion.  However, I loved the plethora of charming pen and ink drawings by Grace that are scattered throughout the book, as well as the phenomenal catalogue of fashion photographs from 1959 to 2012 that are also included.  It appears to me that Grace's strength is to communicate through pictures, not words.  If this is what you are interested in, I highly recommend this book.
B0042L78MG|5.0|This is a great CD.  There are few days that go by where I don't listen to this upbeat music.  Only down side...this is Caro Emerald's only CD.  I hope she does more.  A great listen!  I've also introduced freinds and family to her.  A hit all round.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I missed seeing this while in the theater but recently caught it on a flight. This was one time I totally didn't mind being stuck on a 3 hour flight, I had just enough time to watch the entire thing.<br /><br />This movie is so powerful for those who are willing to believe in its message. Personally I have believed in reincarnation and interconnectedness between spirits for quite some time, but this depiction was so masterful it opened my eyes even more. The film lifted me right out of a little funk I had been in and reminded me of what is truly important in life. The film really gets you thinking and can turn everything in your life on its head.<br /><br />Aside from how the film effected me personally, the quality of it is second to none. The acting, the makeup, the costumes, the scenes, the lighting, the camera work, the story line... Everything about this film is impeccable and world-class. I cannot recommend this film highly enough! Simply a must see!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible app for kindle fire and for smartphones. I will definitely use it as I travel.
B004UJST78|4.0|I found Edward Sapir's introduction to the study of speech fascinating. It discusses a variety of issues involved in the study of spoken language, including differences in grammatical structure, history, and phonetic drift (the way sounds change) as well as many other topics. It reads sort of like a collection of class lectures, but that is okay for those interested in the study of speech. The author understood the origin of language as an evolutionist and that colored his perspective on its nature and the nature of humankind. However he seemed to recognize that modern human sciences really do not understand how language could have actually developed from natural processes. The author shows an apt understanding of almost all the world's major language groups, especially native American languages, some of which he documented first-hand before the time of their extinction or near extinction.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Great show. I was hooked after two episodes. I have passed these discs around the office and got others hooked too.

B007N9FKCY|5.0|I am in absolute awe of this game's level of quality. My first time playing it was much like that of my first time with Super Mario World on the SNES. The music, the aesthetic and bright colors, the simplicity of gameplay mechanics... These are what make this game stand out amongst the heap of not so great platformers on Android.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who loves a good 2D platformer. The difficulty scales quite well level by level, and the challenges really force you to think and react quickly - particularly the jump par challenges. This game really builds on what you learn as you progress. No major curveballs in mechanics, just ramped difficulty until the end. Any free time I've had in the last two weeks has been spent playing Bean's Quest. And when doing other things, I find myself whistling the music.<br /><br />I urge you to give these guys all your money - or at least the $2 they're charging for it. You won't regret it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I played it pretty rugular for a while but you get to a point where the tasks are quite difficult. It's a neat game I got for free. I think it's worth at least the buck their asking. Enjoy.
B00127RAJY|1.0|Jillian Michaels acts like a drill sergeant. She constantly barks orders and demands that the person trying to keep up doesn't stop. She even makes an insulting comment about how she has 400 pound people doing this so we can do it and there's no excuses to not work out.<br />The pace of the video was intense. I did the beginning work out and was so sore I could barely get out of bed the next day. I forced myself to go into work and I had such a hard time walking around my classroom that I had to keep sitting down, which is not a good thing to do. My whole entire body hurt so bad, but my friends said no pain no gain so I tried it again. Could get past the first few min because the pain was so excruciating. I am not a whimp when it come to pain. I usually don't take anything if something hurts, but after this video I was in almost the worst pain in my life.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Excellent condition and I recieved it quickly! Very happy with this product, the sound is clear and concise, just as if I am really there.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This chick right here, she's got &#34;PIPES!!!&#34; What can I say about this &#34;DIVA&#34; that everyone doesn't already know!! SHE&#34;S the BUSINESS!!!! :-)
B0030DIP7O|5.0|If you enjoy music with all the dynamic range and depth, (like vinyl )of the first mastering to cd format, buy this set. These are the same as the original German (ND) releases and I am pleased someone decided to not ruin this great music by using the remastered versions.
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|I ordered the Movie as my friend was travelling to India and he carried it for me. It was a huge disappointment when I tried playing the movie in my 3d player and it said that the movie was coded for Zone A & B and not in Zone C where I was playing it. How am I supposed to know this??? Amazon should make it clear so that an international customer like me does not feel cheated! I dont know what to do with this movie as it is useless for me here.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I enjoyed the show so I decided to read the book and It is just as great as the show.
B002O3Z50G|4.0|Twister came into my life in the late 90's & I have loved this movie ever since the only problem was my 1st  copy was an VHS. Which is hard to even find a player that works for them any more. This product was @ a very good price compared to my local Walmart at the time. & got to me on time as well.... It was a good blast form the past!!!! I would highly recommended it to anybody else!!!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|For the money, this is light hearted hours of entertainment. It definitely helps pass the time during down-time in life.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book now moving onto number two!  The characters are so perfect you feel like you actually know them and can completely connect with all of them-  the way Sylvia writes makes everything feel perfect!!!  I am now a solid fan of GC, if only he were a reality ;-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun.. fast paced.. good graphics and non stop action.. keeps the mind running.. love it . My son is 6 years old nd plays this game all day long... and so do I very addictive..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a cool game in all but the way the different ways to play is so weird. Other than that it's pretty cool.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A delightful book, very funny at times. The characters came to life and you could picture everything about them. Can't wait for the author to write another book.
1885167776|5.0|This is not simply a self help book.  Gary Keller and Jay Papasan take research to a new level.  A manual for creating<br />a Life Worth Living.  A gift to those who of us who read it.  Not the type of book you'll read once and put on the bookshelf.<br />A book to re-read and share with those you love.  Thank you!

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really like this game which is keeping my daughter busy while I watch what I like on tv. Prob one of the best so far.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Everything about this is outstanding, but it would be nice if the cover wasn't plastic.  A more durable material so that you could put it in your pocket, a bag, etc without worrying about cracking or denting it.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Movie was great! Can't believe I've never heard of this movie???! However theres a glitch during the playing of the movie that makes it pause and skip... but I enjoy the movie so, that its not worth the hassle of trying to return it.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My grandkids and me play this all the time..love it as it keeps my eye cordination going and we just have good friendly computitions..great game for Everyone!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun way to pass time. Can become addicting. Fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Fantastic book!  Great read with insightful messages.  Definitely a staple for any type of reader to cover in their lifetime!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A gripping story! My mind raced. I want to read other books by this author now!!! Defending Jacob was well written...the story flows and is so easy to follow!!!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Trust me, unless as a sleeping pill, I am no lover of Opera, but I found Josh Groban years ago on channel 13 and have been hooked ever since. I searched my cd's and found his others....I put them on the player and washed every dish in here. I am missing Illuminations.....but if Amazon has it at a good price....with out shipping and tx....it will be added to my carousel. This last CD has you in Africa one minute and Ireland the next and just when he really get's you bopping......BAM! you're at the MET. I love Prince, but Josh makes me groove too! Get it, then go get all the rest!
B007JMW46U|5.0|I have enjoyed these short stories & how Sherlock Holmes figures out the bad persons. They are well written stories with great characters. Each story has its own set of characters & no 2 stories are alike.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|It is completely addictive. Started by accidentally watching the first episode of season one and got hooked. Season two did not disappoint at all.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|when I first saw the app I thought that it was going to be stupid. but now that I downloaded it it is the funnest game I have!
B00A0L7PE8|3.0|I think the price and Amazon presentation made this look like an entire album, but it's one song done six ways. Should have been 3.99. As for my man Prince, the song is really good!
B0001I561E|5.0|I have been waiting to find this for 1o years.  We are just thrilled as we always are with Disney. Both girls and boys love this one!!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was a great book can't wait to read the next one. I was surprised and kept on the edge of my seat. I could not put the book down it got better and better with each chapter
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you don't have to buy things like other game; there are no adds! right now I'm about to get3 gems for rating!
B000W9EOEC|4.0|The first four or five songs fully met my high expectations, given the really high reviews. \\"Robot Rock\\" (#1) gets a little repetitive, but overall it has a great sound. \\"Touch It\\" (#2) does a better job of staying interesting throughout the song. \\"Television Rules the Nation\\" (#3) keeps your interest by being almost two songs in one. I love how \\"Too Long\\" (#4) gradually increases the beat in the middle of the song. \\"Around the World\\" (#5) has a good beat at first, but it gets a little tired toward the end.<br /><br />Once you've listened to those, it's best to start the CD again from the beginning. The rest are forgettable. Still, I'm giving this album four stars just because the first half of the album is so good.
B0030B0S2Q|5.0|Sam Rockwell is fantastic in this movie.  Music fits perfectly and the plot keeps you guessing all the way.  Great independent film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you on your edge to find out more. How is it all going to end? I will find out soon enough
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Arrived on time and we really enjoyed the movie.  I would recommend this purchase.  Peter Pan is a fun movie for the kids.
B008RXYOKY|2.0|This review is just based on a frustrated Apple products user who hates having to pay this much for an adapter.  An adapter that is needed because Apple decided to change the firewire architecture.......so we can all pay 10 times what a normal price would be for a adapter.  I used Windows based products for 15 years and finally switched to Apple.  Great products but at times they just are too greedy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have not read this book yet, but I always love Grisham's work, so I know I will love this one as well.<br />Frances Reed
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I did struggle during some of the letter exchanging throughout the book because it was boring but there were many twists I liked.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Great movie for the entire family.  We know we can put this movie in and allow the kids to watch without fear!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Definitely the highest quality driver kit I've encountered within a reasonable price range. Bits are high quality, they don't strip if used correctly.<br /><br />The bits are mostly for hand use, if you are going to use these with a power tool anyway, just be careful, and go slow/don't rush it. It might strip the screw otherwise. I've done it, and I'm not complaining since it was my fault.<br /><br />Also be sure to select the correct bit for the job since there are so many variants on the kit. Especially for those phillips type screws and variants, test one size bigger/one size smaller by hand, if you feel it's a better fit then go ahead and use that bit.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever in the whole wide world ever in the app store history I love this game very much
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Quality of sound and picture are excellent. A permanent reminder of two of the best pictures ever made. Number three was pretty good too.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|awesome !!!! Hours of fun and intrigue!! we will definitely purchase the game! My daughter and I think this is so great!!<br />we love it!!!
B003PF1P0Q|5.0|I picked this up on CD years ago and loved it, and recently dug up a double LP version. This is really a great live set of a great live band caught in it's prime. The recording has excellent sound quality, sparkling highs and a nice fat low end. It sounds better than some studio albums as far as the recording/mix/mastering.<br /><br />Some of these songs ('Waterfront' for instance) I consider to be even better live, than the studio version.<br /><br />If you like this bands work, esp from the NEW GOLD DREAM / SPARKLE IN THE RAIN / ONCE UPON A TIME era, do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci at his best!  This book has everything I love and if you like action with a very likeable main character who is both ruthless and caring you will certainly like this book!
B0091THRCU|2.0|With everything sold for any Apple product that is under 19.99 I should expect problems or even failures. With this product that statement stands. The product leaves marks on the phone due to the the edges of the opening are rough. The phone is protected but very difficult to remove. If you need a cheap pocket case this will serve your purpose. In fact I would not recommend this to anyone. There are far better products out there for the same price and that won't damage your phone.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I generally don't like this kind of game, but they got me with Jurassic park. They start with dinosaurs from the movies
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|Seven-disc anthologies are meant to be listened to from start to finish.  A snowy day like this is perfect for savoring in its entirety \\"Skydog\\", the incredible new Duane Allman anthology.  Clocking in at 539 minutes over 129 songs, it is rich in its thoroughness, and the performances throughout are simply magical.<br /><br />It's much, much more than The Allman Brothers, showcasing his performances with numerous others.  Part of what makes this collection a treasure is the abundance of late-60's and early-70s R&B tracks on which Duane played as a session man.  These are great songs on their own, and they provide wonderful glimpses into his slide technique that would later become the signature style heard throughout the Allman Brothers performances.<br /><br />Five stars is Amazon's highest rating, but this box set is worthy of an even higher score.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast paced. Engaging characters . A bit predictable but we'll developed. This was my first introduction to Will Robie, it won't be my last.
B000S1L7IU|4.0|Looks reading Clive  cussler books.<br /><br />Has lots of action  .like Kurt and the rest of the cast.  Have to read more books
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Miserables is my favorite musical, and for the most part this film version does the play justice (Russell Crowe not withstanding). The actors' voices may not be on par with the singers you would hear in the stage play, but the acting is good and this makes up for the voices (the actors' voices are fine, I should mention, just not as powerful as the stage actors').
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Not the worlds greatest novel, but quite entertaining. Yes its a love story. Take out the sex scenes and you have your average heroine who is in love with a guy with more problems than Alan Bates in Psycho. Its the love between the two of them, the fact that he really finds love, sure it has a strange ending, but it is a good introduction to Fifty Shades Darker (well its actually part 1 of 2) I have read these books several times, the more you read them, the more interesting they become. Good character descriptions, but repetitive in thoughts and speach of the characters. The only way is to read it for yourself
B000001EC1|5.0|This is great CD with a lot of their greatest hits.  You will not be disappointed with this CD.  I didn't have this one and wanted to add it to my Bon Jovi collection.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was good I guess it took a long time to find the word I was  looking for though I guess that's just me though.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This is the last already-published Reacher book, and I wanted to savor every word. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but not as much as the others in the series.<br /><br />As always, the bits of humor peppered throughout the book made me smile. One of my favorite bits of dialogue, which also happens to succinctly summarize Reacher's personality is: \\"You don't like to be pushed around, do you, Mr. Reacher?\\" \\"I don't know. I've never been pushed around. If it ever happens, you'll be the first to find out whether I like it or not.\\" Gotta smile at that one, Jack in a nutshell.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the book was more tedious than some of the others in the series. There were holes in the plot, there weren't many characters to like, and the story moved at a pretty slow pace.<br /><br />When the payoff should have happened, for me it didn't. I really didn't follow the explanation at the end of the book for what the bad guys were doing. It made me wish his brother, Joe, had been explaining it. I won't say more than that to spoil the outcome for others.<br /><br />All in all, this one was average for the series. I'm hopeful that the new release in a few months will bring a faster paced, purposeful story.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I really like this game.  But I put a lot of effort and playing time into this, only to lose that.  Please fix this.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Amazing book. Trust in it and read!<br />I loved it dearly. Thrilling romance that will touch your heart to the core!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|This book taught me a lot about having a good conversation with someone. It helped me to improve my way of speaking and hopefully it will help others. I only wish that the book was a bit longer. :)
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I bought this book of because it seemed the best out of a few discounted books. I didn't expect much, but I loved it! Quite a few surprises that made it hard to put down. Very good read!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Like the graphics a lot. Nice rainy afternoon game! Could add some distractions to make it a little more challenging.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|Great app to meet new people especially if your new in a city. It's really fun and I've met a lot of amazing people.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is a puzzle game where you are a drop of water collecting pearls. The graphics are beautiful and the music calming and to top it off the levels are pretty much perfect. All I want to see is that backstory.
0529064847|5.0|Handy book for any household---well made and sturdy. I would recomend it to anyone. Nice print type easy to read.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I love this game and can't put it down!<br />One problem, i lose all saved data if i quit for too long!<br />If this were fixed, it would have five stars from me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved this app. I would recommend this app for 5+. The only problem is that you have to buy most of the outfits and extras with diamonds and they are hard  to get.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great quality, lots of brain work, addicting. Not enough words could describe this game. Magical .definitively one of the best kindle games
B008OURHPY|5.0|This album is amazing!  After I saw her sing \\"Age\\", on YouTube, I had to buy the album and was not disappointed with the impulse buy. Her voice is incredible, they chose the perfect melodies, tones, and intensities throughout the album to display it.  I love most of the songs she wrote.  Overall her songwriting is wonderful.  I haven't been caring too much for R&B/Soul for a while and this album reminds me why I loved R&B/Soul in the first place.  When I first got the album, I started with \\"Age\\" and went from there.  Don't get me wrong, the first few songs are really good but I fell in love with (about) the last of the album. I thought it couldn't get better than \\"Everything, Everything\\" but then I heard \\"Empty\\".  Other favorites are \\"Elusive\\", \\"Age\\", and \\"Forget\\" (but the whole album is great).
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This book is a real page turner. I lost quite a bit of sleep. But it was defiantly worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun , come good when your board @ home it's kinds hard when u first try . But later u will be one hundred % good (:
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, and so does my daughter. we sit and play it all day long from right when she gets home to when she has to go to bed. its a fun game and we live horses!
B002SSUQFG|3.0|The Seiko SNK809 has an attractive face, three hands; second, hour and minute. The stem is hard to get hold of to change the day and date. After consulting with customer service in New Jersey, I find that the watch is suppose to stop when it is taken off for several hours. The time, date and day have to be reset each time the watch is used again. Who wants to have to do that in this day and age, especially with a watch that is originally listed at $138.00?
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Liked the digital copy.  Watched it on computer and home theater.<br />Big fan of Sci-Fi so my opinion is a bit skewed.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|My wife wanted to watch this movie - so we did. Afterwards, she said it was the worst movie she ever watched. I have to agree - it was a disjointed mess.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this so Much I wish it was real but Manny people would die  I love this game wow
B008220D5K|4.0|After reading several reviews, a lot of them filled with speculation about the writers or director, I'd like to first point out that Judd Apatow wrote, directed, and produced this film.  He is in his forties, married, and has three children (all of whom appear in the movie.)<br /><br />I went into this film seeing very little of it online or in trailers, as I enjoy watching most films with unadulterated expectations.  The one exception is that I heard an interview with Apatow on NPR a while back about this movie.  The way he came up with the stories on screen are to some degree literal interpretations of his own life.  The back and forth between the girls?  Well, he actually brought up things they argued about at home in order to get them to respond in an appropriate way on screen.  This really changed the way I viewed these scenes, making them more special than had I not heard this.  Judd Apatow's entire family appears in this movie: the children are his, and Leslie Mann is his wife.  Paul Rudd, as you might hope, is a VERY good friend of his.<br /><br />I won't repeat the synopsis, as you can read it in the product description or in one of the other reviews, but what happens here is a comedic look at life that most of us can relate to.  Growing older while trying to stay cool, having kids but still being sexy, etc.  I thought it was great and a perfect way to spend a couple of hours (movie plus special features, as the film itself is somewhat short in relation to newer films.)<br /><br />The cast was another selling point.  I love Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann (Apatow's wife), but throw in the likes of John Lithgow, Megan Fox, Jason Segel, and another of my personal favorites, Chris O'Dowd, and you've got a perfect comedy in my book.<br /><br />Sure the film could have been changed in places to make it a little better, because it hits a lull in the middle, but overall, it's an enjoyable film.  If you've seen an Apatow movie before you know what to expect here.  If not, know that it is raunchy, racy, and very inappropriate at times.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie overall because my family and I just enjoy the movie. This package didn't cost much but includes the dvd, blue-ray, blue-ray 3D and a digital copy. I went to see this in theaters with my friend and was exited when it came in the mail. Currently I have recommended this movie to my acquaintances and forced some of my friends to watch it.

B009EEFTMC|4.0|I think this game has lots of interesting grates to it. I believe this game can help develops the mind.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is marvelous.  Easy to use, syncs to my PC.  Available thru the cloud.  Reminders and such.  I don't really like todo lists but this one works well.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great controls is what make this game outstanding. Exiting to play and it does not frustrate you. There seem to be enough levels to keep you entertained.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|the last movie was great.  it just finishes the series.  it was very interesting to see how it all ended.  thanks.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Great, kids love this show, arived on time, good value. Would recomend. Better priced than in stores would order again.
B008RJFRTK|4.0|It's great to have the maps in the Kindle when out of wifi range.  Some more instructions would be nice, though.  There are functions that I can't seem to access.
B007885IJU|2.0|I'm a big Neil Young fan.  Neil's web page has a big bunch of recommendations of new folk artists, and I've tried some that are quite good.  The Lumineers is not on that list.  Oh, well, what the heck: Neil and I are old folks.  But what's old when both your politics and the music you've always loved are progressive?<br /><br />The Lumineers have fairly clever lyrics, and the simplicity of the songs is affecting; rather like Neil Young's C - G - D variations.  However, there was one thing I couldn't get out of my head, and that was the -- what was it, exactly?  Was it insincerity?  Let me put it this way.  When I hear the vocals, I get a very uncomfortable feeling, as if the band is trying to sound authentic but they know they're just trying to sound authentic.  Because what is authentic any more?  What is folk music?  Some bands (Mumford & Sons comes to mind) seem to encourage the belief that if you hear a banjo, it's folk music.<br /><br />So I guess that's it: I can't really believe this music.  It comes from the head and not the heart.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Having been a fan of the LOR's trilogy, I was looking forward to the Hobbit. The Hobbit movie adds more detail than what was in the original book which is hardly longer than a short story. The hobbit is a decent movie but there were just too many side stories and amplifications which don't fit with the original book. Even though the movie writers added some storyline, I did find it entertaining and enjoyable to watch. It has beautiful visuals and although I missed some of the characters from the LOR's trilogy, it still have enough to keep me entertained. I recommend it as a good movie to watch as long as you as don't think too much about the storyline versus the book and don't compare it to much to the LOR's trilogy.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|How does Reacher get into these situations?  More importantly....how does he get out of them?  Alive?  Don't start reading unless you've got plenty of time.  You will not be able to put it down.....nor want to!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to set.  Multiple alarms.  Programmable days.  Choice of alarm sounds.  Snooze button.  What more would I want in an alarm clock?
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|There are great moments in The Next Day -- the defiant Bowie of the title track, the romantic Bowie of \\"Boss of Me,\\" and the innovative Bowie in the bonus track \\"Plan,\\" in particular. My difficulty with The Next Day is that the production is smooth as silk to the point of sonic sameness. (One reviewer called it \\"Pro-Toolsy,\\" and I agree.) A listen from start to finish reveals a highly compressed soundscape with Bowie's vocals low in the mix in most of the songs, the exception being \\"Heat.\\" That all said, I'm from a generation that grew up with analog production and vinyl, so I'm rarely pleased by what I hear these days. Still, The Next Day is a worthy effort. I might like it a lot better if it were remixed/remastered.
B00BESKTMG|3.0|The man with the iron fists attempts to pay tribute to all those old Kung Fu movies that were popular in the 70's.  The movie has some promise but ultimately falls flat with its excessive fake blood and violent scenes.  It does have some beautiful scenery but ultimately the tribute seems to trend toward b movie territory instead of giving you something that you want to get deeply involved in.  For those fans of those old style movies, then you may enjoy more.  I was a Bruce Lee fan back in the day, but this version just doesn't translate into a classic.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|I love it works well and the quality is good for this device. I reccommend anyone to get this. Truely
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A free calculator that works.  What more could you ask?  What would you complain about?  Why would you even bother?
B009EEFTMC|1.0|Loved the game till I updated today.  Now the game is unplayable.  Uninstalled and reinstalled...still does not work.  Hope you can fix this soon.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|I am a longtime fan of the band and was looking forward to a new release.  Unfortunately this album follows the trend over recent years of Aerosmith albums that are seeming to be lacking in effort and trying to be 2012 cool as opposed to being Aerosmith cool.  Most songs on here lack any memorable lyrics that make you want to press repeat on your stereo.  There are some decent tunes here but not what I expect from a band that has had so many quality albums and songs.
B008V59AFW|5.0|If you're a fan, then this is for you! An outstanding collection, well presented and packaged. Worth adding to your collection.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Graphical display of wifi hotspots and signal strengths.  Entertaining and sometimes useful.  Has other functions but not generally of interest to me.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this G5 game. I thought it was very well balanced with a wide range of games that keep me interested all the way through. The storyline was excellent.  Very good job G5. Plus it was only $.99. Hot dog!!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Having been taken against my will to this movie, (guys you will understand my plight), I didn't have high expectations since I am not a huge musical fan, but to my surprise this was a well done entertaining movie musical.  Although some of the singing was a little less than impressive, others were amazing, especially the ladies.  This movie was a worthwhile watch and an entertaining film overall.
B008476HBM|2.0|This was the most difficult book I've ever read. I spent nearly as much time reading the dictionary as I did the actual book! After several weeks of reading (not to mention the dozen or so failed attempts at it over the years), I finally made it to the end. I've read many other period pieces, and never had as much difficulty with the language. I'm guessing it's Austen's style of writing that gave me such difficulty, more-so than the time period.<br /><br />As for the story itself, all I could think of was how petty and shallow everyone was. Not to mention insipid. We learned nothing about the characters except who they liked or didn't like, and how much money everyone was worth. I find it difficult to believe that this was the only thing that concerned people during that time. Nothing was said of the careers of the men, or the interests of the women (with the exception of the little mentioned Mary). The entire story was like reading a gossip rag.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I don't really want to create documents on my Fire2 but being able to not only read but edit is very useful.  I haven't tried a PPT but KO does fine with .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, text, and pdfs.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Along with [[ASIN:B005JTI0B8 In Malice, Quite Close]], this is possibly the best book I've read this year. Like IMQC, this, as others have said, is a thriller with a \\"slow burn\\", and saves the best for last. I won't repeat what everyone else has said, but wanted to throw my two cents in in support.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|The movie takes unexpected turns and keeps you at the edge of your seat. It will keep you guessing all the way through till the end. The ultimate commentary is a telling reflection of human nature.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I LOVE this app. It is easy to use and there are many choices. I like the ocean waves and my cats get nice and calm when I set it to kitty purring.
0897500482|5.0|I really love this book. I was a little worn on the edges but for a used book I consider it a steal. The writings are a little hard to follow but fairly easy to keep up with. All together a A++
1878424319|5.0|This book is well written, easy to understand, and teaches you excellent values and principles to live by.  The four agreements suggested make so much sense on how we as a society live with unnecessary suffering such as taking things personal and making assumptions. I have read the book cover to cover 3 times and continue to practice everything in it in my daily life.  Highly recommend it to anyone.
B00742BVW8|2.0|Maybe it is the way they do English subtitles, but is it just me or are these (English subtitled Chinese movies) just incredibly dumb?

B00AG6Z92C|3.0|This is not really worth the price except if you are a Bocelli fan- which I am. It lacked the &#34;Passione&#34; and I did not see any reason for it to have been called the Deluxe Edition and the price for such.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I purchased the James Bond collection as a Christmas present to myself. I have been a fan of 007 for many years. I have already purchased Skyfall to add to the collection. Love it.

B0091REZMW|5.0|Lets get this straight.  Unless you do not have patience for a good fun game this is the game for you. you do not have to pay for diamonds you earn them two ways.  You uncover items that give you energy faster on a continuous basis and also earn items to give you instant help.  This game is awesome fun and a challenge.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I remember the old games and this was one of the best.  Many a hour was spent playing asteroids, pa man, and all the others.  Duck hunt was my favorite.

B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game starts out with really great graphics and game play, for a tablet game.  The solo mode is intriguing and isn't too redundant as to not make you want to go back and replay the levels to earn more coins and experience. Although there doesn't seem to be much of a storyline, moving from stage to stage seems fairly fluid, increasing in difficulty at just the right rate.  Thumbs up!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty addictive game I like it and I think all of you reading this will like it. Give it a try.
B007704HO6|5.0|Just finished this book and it has left me with the warmest feelings of hope.  As a cat person for many years, I can personally attest to the wonderful difference a companion animal can make in a life.  I'm so happy for James.  He seems like a genuinely nice chap who only needed a second chance to get it right.  I expect he's well on his way.  As for Bob, I can only pray that more and more &#34;Bobs&#34; will be given their own chance in the life of a willing human.  Cats (and dogs, etc.) ask for so little; food, shelter and a kind word, and they give so much in return.  Thanks so much to James and Bob for sharing their story with us.  I know they will be an inspiration to many. Now let me go find a tissue!
B007N6NGYG|2.0|This is a great concept. The graphics and the sound effects are also pretty good too. So why only 2 stars? The reason is simple,  just like my title the train de-rails for no reason with clear straight track in front of it. This is very frustrating when you spend time waiting for the trains to be just right so they don't hit each other ony for the train to just fall of the track right in front of it's station :'( So to fhe dev, please fix the glitches and the ratin

B005VPRG10|4.0|I purchased this for $50 which is much higher than i'd like for such a set. It's intricate so my little ones struggled to put it together correctly.  If you buy this, you're likely going to need to help out a little if it's for a child at the younger end of their 8-14 age range. The set seems to fall apart easily when we attempt to pick it up, fly it, move it, etc, as the center cockpit isn't as secure as it should be. Plus, there were a couple of pieces missing from my set. I was surprised that it was so small, considering it was $50. But the minifigures are fantastic and made the cost of the set more palatable.<br /><br />As far as sets go, i was just okay with this one. If you can score it for around $35-$39, that's probably a more fair price. If you hit $40, you've overpaid.<br /><br />Hope that helps.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Does it have everything? It does not...and I have no issue with that. Is it like the Complete symphonic recording? Not at all...I don't think anything will ever compare to that recording.  This recording in it's own right does justice to the \\"highlights\\" version. Just like the film, this is raw and full of emotion. It's not studio album. I'm glad it's not. I think people are being way to picky. The musical and the film are two different mediums, both superb in their own right. If you are a fan of both, get this album.

B0055B7IPE|5.0|I came to love Pixar late and then had to backtrack to watch some films.  Up! I saw at the same time as everybody else and loved it when it came out.  I brought older kids, in their early teens to the film and we were surrounded by parents and kids about 4 or 5 in age.  Young kids in my experience tend to want to get up and go to the bathroom, etc, and can be quite annoying during a movie.  Well not with this film.  The kids sat through the movie glued to the screen sitting quietly with their parents.  And the early teenagers and I loved the film as much as the young children did!  The tale is a heart bending one.  An elderly man who had a loving marriage with no children desires to keep the house they lived in for many years as urban development surrounds him.  People are sympathetic if not completely understanding but see him as an elderly man who should be interacting with other people his age in a retirement home.  An altercation with a construction worker seems to determine his fate and he seems destined to be taken to the retirement home.  Not sure how this would happen, but this is the story.  Carl, the old man, devises a way to escape with his house.  With a large amount of balloons, he lifts himself and his house into the air planning to travel to South America where a legendary waterfall exists and his wife always wanted to go there.  Along for the ride accidentally is Russell, a young Wilderness scout who stopped by to earn a badge for assisting the elderly.  The South American trip includes a talking dog named Dug who believes that Carl is his new master and a man named Munce who was once Carl's idol as a child.  Munce is determined to catch a rare bird and has spent his life in pursuit of it.  Ultimately, Carl and Russell find themselves in pursuit of rescuing the bird, named Kevin by Russell and preventing Munce from capturing it.  The film is quite a lot of fun and holds meaning regarding friendship between people and animals and the importance of staying connected in the world.  Just a wonderful movie and the DVD contains two great short animated movies and a documentary about a place in Venezuela which represented the fictional place, Paradise Falls.ying connected in the world.

086571701X|4.0|This book is very useful. Some parts are missing: how much crops can you breifly grow in a specific situation. Reading the book I couldn't get pump capacity versus free volume in the growing bed and the recommended timing  aligned. This remains unclear. In the chapter dealing with heating the fish tank, a big heat loss is not taken into consideration: evaporation of water from the fish tank! Apart from these small issues I could get most of my questions answered. Certainly this book deserves a recommendation.

The extra stuff makes it an absolute winner i mean how much more original can you get the discs come in a leather like billfold(not actual leather but the same effect) with a lamenated ol' dirty wellfare card , a poster, sticker a pretty thick c.d. booklet. This thing is just all around cool. If you are a Wu-Tang fan and especially if you dont already have return to the 36 chambers the dirty version then you need to get this. Or if your like me you do already have it but all the new stuff with this set makes it worth getting again jump on this deal i'm sure you wont regret it.

B001DSNF8C|5.0|Excellent movie of James Bond. Each element of the formula Bond is gradually presented with a solid script and coherent. Martin Campbell manages to introduce the 007 to a time that corresponds to the current situation and an excellent interpretation of Daniel Craig introducing a new age for the franchise. Also a great edition loaded with bonus material for sastifacion fans.

I tried to like it to the very end, but was so annoyed i couldn't quite make it there. Every time the hub would complain about this or that, i told him to keep it to himself, but finally realized there was no hope for this computer graphic war scene piece of fluff. Another reviewer wrote something about the great depth of character. Huh? That was one of my major complaints.  Really glad we waited to rent it on instant video instead of spending more to see at the theater, or worse yet, buying it!!!  It was definitely an unexpected journey. So sad...

1400030293|5.0|The book makes \\"Fifty Shades\\" look like a bodice ripper, and \\"The Story of O\\" a Penthouse letter. There is not much conventional titillation here, but if you do think the mind is the sexiest organ- and if one wishes to know more of D/s or M/a relationships- this book illustrates the intense, intricate irrationality of this sort of relationship. It is the only novel in the D/s realm I have found that focuses almost exclusively on the psychological side of these relationships. If you, at first glance are intrigued by such a relationship and wonder if it is for you, \\"Gordon\\" will illustrate what that is to its fullest extent. A D/s relationship to it's 33rd degree, which, I feel, goes well beyond the physical.<br /><br />By the way, the re-release is not new. About ten years ago, I heard it reviewed on NPR, and found it most intriguing. As soon as I saw I copy on a bookstore shelf I seized it. One of the best literary investments I ever made.<br /><br />Not much kink or erotica here. I feel the closest you get to that are Gordon and Louisa (the protagonists) in the bathroom, and when Gordon uses Louisa \\"like a boy\\". The sex is perfunctory, it is just an extension, manifestation of Gordon's power over Louisa. So the substance of this book is not in the \\"acts\\", but in Gordon's mental domination of Louisa, and her ceding herself psychologically to him. In the first chapters Louisa's mind is befuddled as to why she is compelled to be with him and under him. He isn't her type, not the sort of man she would have created for herself, yet his power and draw is there, sensed by her, and is irresistible. She does fight her self-cession as any strong, intelligent woman would, but Gordon's enigmatic, compelling power fills a void in her. She does not merely accept or tolerate his effect, but comes to embrace it and make it a need. Her outlook on men and relationships is more than altered- it is re-formed, reinvented.<br /><br />From Gordon's side he does overtake and consume Louisa effortlessly, bordering on the breezy. He makes it look easy. Yet the book will reveal his deepest flaw- an inability to come to terms with himself and his innate quality and need. I won't spoil and go into how that happens, but he does demonstrate that dominant men are indeed human, not supermen. The characters are not all that likable. No heroes or villains necessary here. That isn't the point. Indeed, it would get in the way.<br /><br />For those who view relationships in a conventional sense, they will likely see a tale of abuse and usurpation. Some of it will be disgusting. It's understandable. You'll have to think way outside the box. But for a few out there in the world who are tuned in it will reveal, and in a very alternative way, comfort. So if you've read the bestsellers in this genre and have a taste for more, this book gives you the ultimate destination. See if you wish to go there.<br /><br />For those of you interested in, and intrigued by, \\"Daddy\\" issues, the last chapter may be an eye popper...a effortlessly, bordering on the breezy.

B00076OMW4|5.0|These recordings date from 1955-57 and the remastering for SACD is another major success in a notable series. The original recording was made on three tracks and that has enabled the SACD version to be made using the three front speakers for the three tracks. There is real benefit from the more natural spread of sound thus achieved.<br /><br />The earliest recording from 1955 is an absolutely sizzling performance of the Bartered Bride. This is the only performance that I have heard to match the Ancerl version with the Czech PO from about 1960, also now available in the Ancerl Gold series in remastered 24 bit sound. That too, showed off some wonderfully precise string playing and an exhilarating rhythmical control leading to a thrilling conclusion. Reiner has the advantage of better recording quality which belies the early date totally.<br /><br />The Carnival Overture also is a thrilling performance, one of very few to come within miles of the Kertesz / LSO performance from about 1963. Once more the Reiner performance has the better sound regardless of age and once more the performance has the same rhythmical control and the accelerando towards the end brings about an exciting conclusion. Schwanda from 1956 is here considerably enhanced over the previous issue with the tendency towards shrillness completely controlled. Any remaining shrillness lies in the nature of the composition.<br /><br />The 9th symphony dates from 1957 and now sounds sumptuous. There have been many recordings of this core repertoire symphony over the intervening fifty years, many of which must be counted as very fine indeed. They include in no particular order, Szell, Kubelik, Harnoncourt, Kertesz, Karajan, Ashkenazy, Alsop, Ancerl, Macal, Fischer, Jarvi and Barbirolli of which many still remain references by which new issues are compared. There are also Abbado and Dausgard to consider on Bluray. They all bring special insights to bear and many would suffice as an 'only' version. This is a symphony which has inspired a great number of fine performances on record and that must also be a tribute to the quality of the writing which encourages performers to rise to the occasion<br /><br />However, even among such illustrious company, I find that Reiner's star still shines.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|This is a book worth reading if you are interested in the topic.  However, it offers no proof of heaven.  It does offer a very unusual NDE, but despite Dr. Alexander's probably very well meant &#34;proofs&#34; offers nothing in the way of what any scientist would consider to be proof.<br />If you are already a heaven believer, this will not change your mind.

B00014X8KO|4.0|I love the first two story two stories to the movie. Fun and entertaining. But i just cant make out or figure out the last story. Even seeing the special features to the movie, the directors couldnt even tell you what the story was about. Lol. But over all good flick.

B00BNNJHXO|3.0|They seem to get calmer and &#34;lighter&#34; with every album they release.  Most of this I wouldn't even consider metal.  That being said, there are some definitely heavy and hooky tracks on this one.  It's was worth the buy in my book, although I do wish they would return to heavier roots.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Never seen any of the episodes, but know i own the entire series. Great Visual and Audio, the best dvd ever....
B004SUDPXW|5.0|What can I say? I hate the show because its so good and hate Amazon for making it to easy to order. Lol. I love the series. I have the fourth season on order right now. Hate the fact that I've been trying to save to do maintenance on my car. But gosh I have to see what's next on the next season of breaking bad. Lol.
B00BF11STU|2.0|This movie was just lacking.  Lacking story, lacking tension.  First of all the opening sequence needed to show the planes hitting the towers.  The black screen with the audio was just lame.  The biggest omission was the complete lack of tribute to the seals that died shortly after the raid.<br /><br />WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Associated Press has learned that more than 20 Navy SEALs from the unit that killed Osama bin Laden were among those lost in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.  This was the largest single loss of life ever for SEAL Team Six.<br /><br />There should have been some kind of tribute to them at the end of the movie.  The tip toeing around Obama's reluctance to attack the target was lacking and lame. The only good thing about this movie was the scene involving the raid itself.  I just can not recommend this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game. so  indicting. you do not have to enter any personal information. do u  like. horses?? this is the game for u then .  this app is free
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I haven't been huge fan of his music, but this album I absolutely love every song. Nice tempo reminiscent of old school R&B and nor overly inundated with the Rap that seems popular these days (not my choice of music, but to each his/her own).

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Loved the books and the series is staying true to it. Sets amazing, direwolves and dragons so real, and beyond The Wall...loved it!
0345803485|1.0|Dweebs love this book.  A dweeb wrote this book.  The world is run by dweebs, reading dweeb \\"literature\\", on their dweeby little Kindles.  Read the \\"positive\\" reviews.  It will make you feel sick.  To be fair, I only read the first five pages of this book.  I had to skip over a lot of the words along the way.  At the end of the five pages, I wanted to get to some sex.  So I went online and looked up the \\"best sex excerpts\\" from the book.  A couple turned me on.  For maybe half a sentence.  The other half of the sentence made me feel like I was reading the diary of a retarded young girl at a mental institution who was writing about being raped by one of the guards.  Sick, sick sick.  Not that this was written.  The writer can write whatever they want.  But it is sick that there is such a fan base, a following of dweebs who are lawyers, doctors, accountants who influence society.  Or....it's just a bad book, no big deal, just don't buy it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it the best of all the solitare I've tried.  I play this for almost hours at a time.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|This movie was an endurance contest.  The biblical/Christian aspect felt forced into the story (and the book as I understand) for what could only be marketing purposes to a westernized audience.  It certainly did not aid or move the story along.
B0002KPIQY|3.0|I was expecting it to be much different. Angelina Jolie was amazing as usual, I was pleasantly surprised on how well Elizabeth Mitchell acted in this movie. I was hoping for more of a story line between Linda and Gia, and maybe that's why I didn't like as much as I thought I would. Overall, it was ok and I recommend at least watching it once.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|dun think the 3d work was that great. but the movie quality itself is very good. worth watching again n again.
1400095204|5.0|My first encounter with Chimamanda Adiche's work was last year when I came across her TED Talk \\"The Dangers of a single story\\". Since then I've read some of her collected shorts stories in \\"The Thing Around Your Neck\\" and even got the opportunity to hear one of her talks in person. My interest in her work has grown so of course I wanted to read one of her most acclaimed works so far: \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\"<br />Early on Adiche presents her principles from her TED Talk \\"The Dangers of a Single Story\\" as the story is told by three different narrators. Even though the narrators are connected, each is unique and comes from a different background. Ugwu, a young boy from a poor village is hired as Odenigbo's houseboy. Olanna, an educated young woman from a wealthy family and Odenigbo's lover. Richard, a british man who arrives in Nigeria as writer pursuing his interests in Igbo pottery and the lover of Olanna's twin sister Kainene. Between the characters there are differences in education, social class,family life, and even race but all three characters experience the upheaval and turmoil of the Nigeria in the 1960s.<br />Each character is unique from the others and their intertwined relationships makes a much more rounded portraits of the others. For example between part one and part two of the story there is large time gap from the early sixties to the late sixties. While somethings have remained the same, their have been dramatic shifts. Olanna now has a child Odengibo and the relationship between her and his mother seem to have improved. However there is hidden strain on the relationship that involves Richard and is not revealed until later and only hinted at through the three different perspectives.<br />What I liked most about this novel was how Adiche was able to balance the different narrators. Most of these character have something specifically driving them, and as time progresses, these characters change along with it. In just the first 200 pages of the book there are shifts already happening in the story. Ugwu starts as young boy from a poor village that begins to be exposed to an entirely different environment working in Odenigbo's house. Olanna, though well educated and very beautiful has self doubt and is initially attracted to Odenigbo's confidence. However  she is aware that her relationship with Odenigbo is still fragile and questions if they will last. When Odenigbo does cheats her fears are confirmed but the relationship still lasts. Richard, even before living in Nigeria has always felt like an outsider whether in his family or social circle. Richard begins to feel a sense of place when starts his relationship with Kainene but her aloof nature still makes him feel distanced from her. With Richard, even as he begins to feel like he's finding his place, he learns how to speak Igbo and is there when the Biafra movement begins to get momentum, he is still confronted by the fact that he is an outsider when Igbo people are killed right in front him but he knows he would not be targeted because he is white.<br />I found Kainene to be a very interesting character and rather deserving of her own narration because of her independence. She is a very aloof character and not fully understood by many of the character's such as Richard who spends part of the novel wondering what she really thinks of him. I would like to the POV of this character but I can understand why Adiche would choose not to give this character a regular POV like the others. It is the fact that other's cannot really know what she's thinking that makes her such an interesting character. She is first introduced by the fact that she and Olanna never talk to each other as they used to when they were children. Her sister, like the rest of her nuclear familiy, is described in at least one instance as a body of strangers. It is her distance that keeps Olanna and Richard reaching out to try and connect to her. Overall the characters are vivd and propel the novel.This is a great novel and well worth your time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite TV shows. I can't wait for the next season to start! The characters are wonderful.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|How annoying is it that this woman uses the words \\"delicious\\" and \\"deliciously\\" over and over again? I think I lost count after thirty. Now I understand why people got so frustrated with the writing. Yikes.

B00009L1UP|5.0|In all seriousness, there is not one single word to describe how amazing \\"Empire\\" truly is. It is truly without question one of Queensryche's best albums, as well as one of the best rock/metal albums of the early 90's. It's definitely an essential masterpiece that never gets old. Even though \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" is considered to be Queensryche's best album, but it was \\"Empire\\" that introduced these Seattle progressive metal geniuses to the world. I got \\"Empire\\" off on Amazon several weeks ago, and I've had it in rotation since then. It's just absolutely brilliant and amazing, I love it. It contains everything that everyone loves about these guys from brilliant and intelligent lyrics and songwriting to amazing musicianship, and the songs range from beautiful ballads, to strong melodic rockers, and classic heavy fist pumpers, believe me, it's all on here. Geoff Tate leads the charge here with his amazing vocals, meanwhile guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton both display their ever so talented skills with plenty of awesome riffs and fantastic solos throughout. Eddie Jackson pounds out basslines that are like body blows to your ribcage, and Scott Rockenfield does an excellent job behind the drums as well. Every song here on \\"Empire is just flat out awesome, so there is absolutely no skipping required whatsoever.<br /><br />The Highlights:<br /><br />\\"Best I Can\\" is an excellent opener that features a smooth catchy keyboard intro, and then Geoff's vocals soon come into play, as well as some great catchy guitar riffs, backing keyboards, rumbling bass, and upbeat percussioning which all turn the song into a catchy and uplifting rocker. Track two \\"The Thin Line\\" is another one of my favorites on here, and an excellent melodic prog rocker that is highlighted by catchy, crunching riffs, pounding basslines, and passionate vocals, and there's also some awesome keyboards near the end too. Up next, we have \\"Jet City Woman\\" which of course is the album's most recognizable track and another one of my favorites on here as well. This track is an amazingly catchy and powerful melodic rocker that deals with love and relationships but on a more serious level without being cheesy. Geoff's melodic vocals are just awesome, and the choruses are absolutely excellent, catchy, and extremely sing-a-longable, and the guitar solo is just perfect. Track four \\"Della Brown\\" is a fantastic laid back, bass-laden track that features some great emotional vocals and more cool melodic guitar soloing, meanwhile the following cut \\"Another Rainy Night (Without You)\\" is an emotional melodic power rocker that features heartfelt melodic power chords, an emotional soaring chorus, and an awesome melodic solo as well.<br /><br />Next, we head straight for the album's title track \\"Empire\\" which is a classic heavy fist pumper that of course has some serious pump to it, and of course this is also my personal favorite track on here as well. It is highlighted by heavy, doomy riffage, plus hefty, solid drum beats, and dark lyrical content that warns of a foreboding and unstoppable \\"Empire\\" of drug trafficking within the United States and it's related crimes that will inevitably lead to the breakdown of civility in American Society. There's also another amazing guitar solo as well. Track seven \\"Resistance\\" is another brilliant and awesome strong rocker that features more catchy sing-a-long vocals and tasty guitar riffs, as well as another fantastic solo. The album's eighth track \\"Silent Lucidity\\" is a beautifully brilliant Pink Floyd-esque ballad as well as one of the band's best known songs that feature guest orchestration from the late Michael Kamen, plus some great folky acoustic strumming, peaceful vocals, and another fantastic melody induced guitar solo. This song is just epic, beautiful, and brilliant to say the very least. The following track \\"Hand on Heart\\" and \\"One and Only\\" are both fantastic melodic rockers that just flat out rock your socks off, and then we have the album's final track, the ever so epic \\"Anybody Listening?\\" which lyrically deals about living life in the spotlight very much similar to the classic Rush song \\"Limelight\\" from 1981's \\"Moving Pictures\\". This song is definitely an epic, and a brilliant way to end an essential masterpiece of an album.<br /><br />We're also treated with three fantastic bonus songs in \\"Last Time in Paris\\", \\"Scarborough Fair\\", and \\"Dirty Lil' Secret\\" which makes this remastered version more enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Empire\\" is an all out essential and intelligent progressive rock/metal masterpiece from the very first start all the way to the very end, and an amazing follow up to \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" I might add. Even though this album does fall a bit tad short behind \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\", but it's still essential nonetheless, and it's definitely well ahead of it's time. I strongly recommend this album to fans of Queensryche, progressive rock/metal, or just great music in general...<br /><br />HORNS UP!!!ve the album's final track, the ever so epic \\"Anybody Listening?\\" which lyrically deals about living life in the spotlight very much similar to the classic Rush song \\"Limelight\\" from 1981's \\"Moving Pictures\\".

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|good game a lot of waiting but good wish I didn't have to buy bucks to help landscape. but ok I guess
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This arrived promptly and in excellent condition.<br /><br />Watching this series is GREAT!  No blood nor guts - just sopa-opera like involvement in the characters lives!  The characters up and downstairs face ups and down, death and disappointment.  We can relate!  And the British humor is delightful!  Also, the fact that not evertything turns out 'happily ever after&#34;.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|True to the book(as far as i can remember have not read the book in 15+ years). Top notch performance from every cast member and the atmosphere Coppola creates is chilling and memorable. Pay close attention when you watch this there are tons of hidden things and creepy little easter eggs throughout.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|The game was.fun at first, but then overnight all of my data was erased and i was just about to purchase the tiger shark! now im really p.o because i was getting so freaking close! i would have been 5 stars, but no you guys just had to erase my data and now im back.at the stupid reef shark! it took me forever just to get the hammerhead shark! i was a mere 3000 coins away from getting the tiger shark, and it costs 15000 to get the tiger shark then right after the tiger shark is the great withe shark, now i am sooooooo ticked &gt;:( &gt;:(
0786958731|4.0|Lite, as in rules, not content. This box is crammed with content. The tiles, the minis, the cards. The components alone are well worth the cash. I'd tried to get my wife into tabletop D&D, critical failure. She had ZERO interest. I was pretty sure she would hate this game. SURPRISE! We played last night and she LOVED it! This is NOT role playing. This is a STRATEGY game, with some RPG elements. Random nature of the game means no two sessions will be the same. The tiles and minis create a strong visual experience. This game is not easy. We barely got out of our first game session alive. Think of this as a dungeon crawling video game (Think Wizardry, etc) in physical format, on your tabletop. The minis are well-sculpted and impressive looking. (Especially the big red guy) Rules are simple, there is a beginner and advanced game. VERY pleased, well worth the $$$. NOTE: DO NOT think you will open box and start playing immediately. The dungeon tiles and counters took nearly an hour to punch out and sort. Yes, there is THAT much content<br /><br />Well played, WOTC!
B00846WWVM|3.0|This game can be played by kids or adults. It's interesting to try and get all the fires out without running out of water. So put your thinking cap on and play away! However I recommend waiting for either getting the game for free or getting it less then a $1.99 . I personally would have not paid the asking price it shows now even though it was an ok game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addicting for a long while but once you build up your stash of prizes and unlock all of the perks you will never run out of coins again and for me that meant it was time to move on.
159420411X|4.0|Very good illustration of the way predictions work and why and most of the time miserably fail. The only negative point is that sometimes you get too much detail for the point he wants to get across. Anyway it’s clear and worthwhile reading it and I’m sure that I’ll get back to some of the chapters as the weather forecast, how to drown in three feet of water or leass and less and less wrong.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I've read the whole series. and enjoyed it. Considering all that happens in the books,<br /> the series has done a good job portraying the heart of it. Good acting and production.<br />Attention to detail. Looks like a movie, not a series. Some may call it a fantasy series,<br />but the characters are real. They show the best and worst of humanity. Looking forward<br />to future seasons and the final books in the series. Thanks George R.R. Martin for your<br />books and all involved in the series for making it something special.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Can not get any apps I downloaded that day why can't I get them not happy with this at all
B00BHMF578|4.0|The story behind this movie is so great that it couldn't help being a good thrilla. I thought they brought it off very well. What isn't so acceptable, though, is the video quality from amazon via Roku. It's definitely the fuzziest movie I've ever watched. Not a huge deal for me, an old timer who remembers when the best quality was so bad it made your eyes water. But, there were subtitles in it, and they were pretty close to illegible. Most of the credits at the end were completely illegible. I paid for the HD version, at that. So, they tell us they'll crank down the quality if bandwidth demands; OK, but, then, they should also crank down the price to the low-res level.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Its a good thing for kindle fire and gives you a good chance to play a funny game whit many opportunities to explore a different ways for your kid's. It's a friendly option
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love that Downton does not make you sit through the details of every situation.  They set up the circumstance and move on without dragging it out.  We got all three seasons from Amazon to get caught up.  The ONLY bummer is now we have to wait until next year to pick up the story where we left off.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is worth it.it is kinds like the real minecraft for Pc but it is missing stuff but who cares.minecraft pe is way better then the demo and other games that copy minecraft
B00004W3L3|5.0|Being a fan of Marillion in the 80's, I love this album. Musically, I'd say Misplaced Childhood is moving towards the commercial side of the spectrum compared with Script for a Jesters Tear and Fugazi (which I'd rate very slightly above Misplaced Childhood) - however this is still an excellent album.<br />The 'single' Kayleigh of course is probably Marillion's most famous song - when it was being played regularly it got a bit 'old', but listening to this again after a few years brings back good memories.
B00AHDXTIK|4.0|Griffin is pretty well known for making good quality chargers and cables for the iPhone,  and this new 3 meter (9.85 feet) cable is a welcome addition.  I FINALLY don't have to use a female to male cable extender when I don't have close access to a power outlet!  Example:  break room at work,  lying on the couch,  dinner table (yes, I know it's rude using your phone there),  or the rear seat of a friends car.<br />The cable is on the thick side and lacks flexibility,  but it looks like its built to last.  You'd have a hard time breaking this one.  It's reasonably priced considering how much longer it is than Apples own Lightning cable.  My only complaint is that Griffin doesn't make white colored cables and chargers for us people with the white iPhones.  Yea,  that's pretty petty,  but I like color uniformity with my gizmos.  Still a great cable if you need something longer than the standard one.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Funny, relevant, informative. Attractive cast. This movie gave me a great two hour break!Good movie to watch with a couple of friends with a good bottle of wine!

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Doesn't seem to have any explanation on strategy or exactly how it works...so is lots of trial and error.  But it makes the time go faster on long car rides.  It is a bit addictive.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Just wish I could play off line. But other than that its a cool game. if you are looking for time to kill and you remember command and conquer you will love this one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is pretty much as promised by the designer.  It can at times be challenging.  Wish I could see the solutions for a couple of them.  Starts easy and then gets downright difficult.  Ordered and delived on iphone.
B00BESFWBY|1.0|So cheesy! They try to hook you in the last 2 minutes, but the overall movie is horrible. Definitely don't recommend, and I'm a 26 year old guy that likes surfing.

B0086700CM|5.0|this games is better then temple run 2 because this game has harder course and plus some of courses trick u so I like this to my opinion
B0049J3QF4|5.0|got this on my ruku while my grandson was here.  He loved it and would sit and watch it a couple of times a day.  Great story and I love Owen Wilson and Ellen Degeneres.  So it was a hit for all of us.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|True to its name it's a SEIKO and runs great. I haven't lost or over gained time. Out of the box it came with the quality and craftsmanship I would expect. This watch replaced a Luminox watch that broke i less than a year and if it's like my other 17 yr old SEIKO then I think I have this for awhile.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is so much fun! We have played it over and over again to keep beating the game. We can't wait for the next one!
0060751967|3.0|Shanna Whelan is already in the witness protection program, forced to start her life anew in a new place and without her family.  Her enemies aren't content to let her disappear so they send their best assassin/vampire to kill her.  Luckily Roman Draganesti stumbles into her 24 hour dentist office just in time.  Looking for a dentist to repair his fang, Roman snags Shanna away from the assassins, hoping she'll agree to fix his fang.  What follows is a cutesy adventure romance where Roman must learn to trust again and Shanna must believe and deal with the fact that Roman is a vampire.  Shanna's got a lot of surprises coming at her along the way though.<br /><br />This is a cutesy tale though I think the title is a bit misleading.  Roman is a vampire and he's a millionaire but Shanna isn't itching to marry him or anything.  Ah but perhaps it's just me that finds this title a bit weird.  I liked that there was a bit of adventure and I liked that the vampires were traditional vampires.  No sparkling, witchy daylight rings, or other tricks up their sleeves.  They sleep at night and drink blood, which is surprisingly refreshing.  I also loved the side characters.  They were lots of fun and helped to keep my interest.  I didn't love Shanna though she wasn't unlikeable.  She simply used bad judgment though she wasn't too stupid to live.  Or it could be that the adventure and romance had a difficult time meshing together at the same time.  When the mafia is after you and have almost succeeded numerous times in killing you, I just don't think you run away from a safe place upon finding out upsetting news regarding your relationship.  Incidents like this kind of bugged me.  Again, I'm not sure if this is Shanna's character or just the push and pull of the plot.<br /><br />Overall an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.  Great for when you are in between books or just want a fun read without too much thought.

193418070X|5.0|The Graceling Realm series is so imaginative and introduces readers to a world where people have special powers that others fear called Graces.  For many, including Katsa, her Grace is more a curse than a blessing.  She finds herself as a personal enforcer and mercenary for her uncle because of her unique skills.  When a series of mysterious events occur, she finally finds the strength to do what's right and seek the truth to a recent puzzle.  For all her strength and skill Katsa finds that she still has a lot to learn.<br /><br />On the story...<br />I absolutely loved Graceling.  I fell in love with the world-building, the premise, and Po.  I just love Po.  I didn't love Katsa because she came off a bit robotic to me and I didn't connect the way I did with Po.  I loved that Katsa was the ultimate heroine and didn't fit any stereotype at all.  This was also a well-balanced story.  We get a little bit of romance, a whole lot of action, a decent amount of mystery, and so much creativity.<br /><br />On the narrators...<br />This was a full cast audio and I'm still not sure how I feel about that.  There were multiple narrators, music, and sound effects.  I'm so accustomed to none of that being present that I found it a bit more distracting than helpful.  It didn't keep me from enjoying the story but I'm thinking I like things simple from my audiobooks.<br /><br />Overall...<br />I realize I am late in the game as many have read this one ages ago.  Books like this make we questions why I don't step out of my comfort zone more often.  I'd recommend it in book form the audio does a great job.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I just found out about this little sequel and I like the the game it's fun and interesting. I'm only on wave 4 but so far I'm impressed although I wish we could actually hit the zombies instead of having the character stand there and do it.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Season 1 is great! you are on the edge of your seat all show.  The next seasons are not that good though, they are not as realistic.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Megan wakes up married to Connor Reed and can't remember how this could have happened.  Convinced that this was an impetuous and drunken decision, she is determined to end the marriage as soon as possible. Fortunately, Connor remembers why they decided to marry and know that it was based on rational reasons that he still believes in.  Now he must convince Megan to give their marriage a try.  Interestingly enough there is two parts to this story.  Connor wants Megan to stay married to him, but for the original reasons.  He wants the marriage he bargained for.  But can he have both Megan and the marriage he bargained for?<br /><br />Waking Up Married is a cute story and a quick read.  There is a little more to this story than two people getting married in Vegas after a crazy night.  I just wish I had gotten to see part of the Vegas craziness rather than hearing about it afterward in bits and pieces.  Some of the most exciting and fun sounding events happened off the page and were merely described through dialogue between characters.  This allowed the focus to remain on the characters and the romance but it also kept me in the characters' heads a bit much. When Megan and Connor are in the scene together it was just perfect.  There is a period of time where we are in Megan's head only and that's a bit annoying because Megan thinks the same thing over and over again.  Connors is a great leading man and I fell in love with him right away.  He wasn't perfect but it's all part of the story.  I thought the romance was quite sweet and ultimately left me satisfied with this book.  I did pick this one for the romance.<br /><br />If you are looking for a sweet romance, look no further.  If you want  a little more then this one might leave you less than satisfied.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Again, the story is familiar, but the music and presentation are terrific!<br />The scenes of the various groups presenting their accapella (sp) shows are great
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|good story and good graphics and to unlock its only a buck. not bad. i will definitely consider more g5 games
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I really enjoy this offering from Big Fish.  Even the timed level offers a &quot;give m more time&quot; option.<br /><br />Sometimes, it does freeze, but I am not sure if that is a bug in the program, or my tablet.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|love it- easy to play yet still fun.  many levels to play. recommend for anyone that likes match 3 games
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I had bought two different cases online and returned both.  I got my Vibe case yesterday and it is perfect for my needs.<br /><br />The case might or not be real leather--it looks nice and the little pattern on the front gives it a bit of interest.  Most likely my Kindle won't be used for more than books and movies, and won't get carried around/tossed into totes, briefcases, etc. very often; as such, the &#34;leather&#34; quality is perfect for my needs.<br /><br />What I really wanted was the elastic strap to keep the cover shut for those occasions when I do tuck the Kindle into my purse or tote.<br /><br />The unexpected bonus in this case (for me) was how the angled viewing worked.  Instead of ridges on the back of the case for the Kindle to rest against, the case liner itself is &#34;grippy&#34; enough to simply open and rest the device at the desired angle.  I've only had the case one day so don't know if the &#34;grip&#34; will deteriorate over time.<br /><br />Why 4 stars: There is no stylus holder (no matter to me as I won't use one).  Also, there are no cut-outs for speakers.  I was playing music this morning and it sounded OK to me, but most likely was slightly muffled.  If cut-outs are important to you, this is not the right case.<br /><br />However, if like me, you plan to watch movies and read books and occasionally play a little music and don't need crash protection, this is a very nice cover.  The read was a nice shade.
0316044938|5.0|A sad story of a young girl's short life ending far to soon at the hands of a monster...but loved the heavenly interventions.  A great read!
B0013D8LOK|4.0|If you're into dark musicals, this movie is for you!! Johnny Depp is an amazing singer and will have the music stuck in your head!!
0374533571|5.0|This was a book that was hard to put down.  I finished it just in time for a Girls Night Out to see the movie.  I passed it on to my daughter-in-law to read.  We both loved it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and enjoyable to play. I toats recommend it to anyone and everyone! ;D hahaha c:

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I ordered it for my teenaged daughter who doesn't usually like love-ish type stories, but she was drawn to these characters and their particular quandary.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I first \\"experienced\\" this sensory pleasure years ago on VHS but they released it on DVD??!!<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you. Pink Floyd in Pompeii is a journey of super-unique music that must be seen AND heard to appreciate the uber talented group of musical visionaries a.k.a. Pink Floyd.<br /><br />Get ready for a truly immersive treat for thy every sense. Get it if you are a real fan...you'll not be disappointed. What else can I say?<br /><br />C'est magnifique!!!!!
B00005JOHC|5.0|I received years one and two for a fathers day gift two years ago. Put them on a shelf and didn't bother opening them. Last month, out of boredom I opened and watched the first disc. I have since ordered seasons three through eight. If you enjoy light adult humor and like to laugh, this will keep you going!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is a great book like the 50 shades without all the s&m stuff. This is my second time reading the book and I still enjoy it<br /> A woman on the bus recommend it when she saw me reading 50 Shades. I'm glad I picked this book up.
B00BDNCXTE|5.0|Great set list, perfect tempo for a JGB show!! I highly recommend - you will NOT be disappointed. Can't stop listening.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not one of Grisham`s best works but still enjoyable. If you are new to his work pick one of his classics and save this one for later
B007N9FKCY|2.0|This game was mildly amusing, but I couldn't get very far as the controls were very touchy and hard to play on my Kindle Fire (2nd gen). It would be a much better game to play on a computer or other device with actual keys rather than a touch screen.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I would have preferred that it would have a firmer base...also; , if only fits one size kindle fire. It kept collapsing while in a standing (Open) position
B001HN6922|5.0|Same review as Barbie (Nutcracker)!  Great packaging and service!  Quick to arrive!!  Thanks for being a great service.  You make shopping really easy!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Horrible ending but good story. Heartbreaking but good lessons. Don't lose who you agree. Don't ever give up. Thanks Katniss.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The connection is made. Be a participant in your own healthcare. This may just work for you. My reaction<br />was to remove as much wheat/ gluten products as possible, but living with others I 'm weaning them off what was left over, i.e. corn tortillas, etc. I did the same after reading &#34; Sugar Blues&#34; ten years ago.<br />Positive health results followed.  Thanks for being a voice for good. NH
0877180121|3.0|I think it was way too hard for my 5 1/2 year old daughter.  I am using a color coded system that works great but will keep this book for when she gets older.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love this album.  Bruno Mars is such a creative artist and this new album does not disappoint!  I can't wait for more new music from him.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Love this. Bought this over a year ago. Charged my kid's iPhone at the same time while watching my kids iTunes media and Netflix on their TV. So happy I got this.
B0063GORYU|1.0|Coincidence? As soon as I gave it 5 stars for being fun and addictive I started getting so many ads it was distracting and annoying. It's no longer an addiction for me. Where before I would play it for hours, now I'm sick of the ads in minutes, and move on to something else.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|This is a Christmas dvd that my daughter wanted.  I have observed her watching it and she loves the characters, the fast pace of the story, the under riding story theme...is excellent.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|action packed as all are  good reading all the way through.reacher is different than all the others.a stand alone guy.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|The 3D was really enjoyable. Didn't see this movie, at the theaters, so it was a good story and the 3D effects were pretty good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app. Both of my love this game. Very realistic about taking care of the horses. I would recommend the app for girls.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|I was very disappointed in this movie. The amount of &#34;questionable&#34; themes and language really surprised me. It was a shame because that really overshadowed what could have been an ok movie. Do people really talk like that all the time. Maybe they were taking creative liberties. However, I was not impressed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thanks Hugh. I stumbled across this series while looking for something new to read. Funny because I have read many novels from the post apocalyptic theme, but was not really looking for that when I found this. But now consider it one of the more &#34;creative&#34; approaches!<br /><br />I'm in the creative field ( although on the graphics side ) and love and preach creative thinking everyday. Love the way you think, keep it up. Sorry, got to go now, need to go download a few more HH books!!
B0047WJ12K|4.0|It is a good movie.  You need to pay attention to put things together at the end.  Over all a better movie than was reviewed when it first came out.
B006G7Y7GY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was really funny and had me laughing out loud several times. Couldn't put it down read it in one setting.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a very long time! Great story! Very uplifting and a story that has never been told before.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Pros: Intriguing story line, great acting and sets. Weaves all that with mature scenes and themes that were prevalent in that day making it very realistic. In blue ray; the detail, sound, and color is fantastic.<br />Cons: Too long between seasons... For me: Some of the best characters die at the end of the first season. Wish you could see it on the big screen.<br /><br />It is a television series produced by HBO based on the Song of Ice and Fire novels written by George R.R. Martin
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I like this game!!!! It's very fun a has that perfect strategic feel to it.  I honestly which the player was more into the action and done more attacks manually with a joystick for movement.
0790729393|5.0|Edge of the seat thriller. Intense. Good movie. Great acting by all. Edge of the seat thriller. Intense. Good movie.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The many layouts and levels of play make this game both challenging  and fun.  I also like the opportunity to get a hint.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use and fun. Play it all the time. Does not ask you to buy credits to play. Makes it fun to pass the time in waiting rooms.
B00BP4Z8XY|1.0|I rented the video online. I tried playing in Chrome and in Firefox. In both cases, I received an error saying my Flash Player version needed to be updated. I am currently running Adobe Flash Player version 11, which is what is required. I still am receiving an error. This has been a waste of $3.99. Way to go Amazon. I am never doing this again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|From the first page to the last I couldn't put this series down. Empowering ending to a wonderful series of books. If you have made it to Mocking Jay, Suzzane Collins has you hook, line, and sinker!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love love loved this book! Everything you are looking for in a post apocalyptic sci fi book. From the first page to the last, I never guessed what was coming and it was awesome.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Great series! I highly recommend Columbo to anyone who wishes to see hours of good, clean,refreshing--and, yes--<br />humorous entertainment, for a murder mystery series. Peter Falk is perfect for the part of Columbo, and each and every episode has famous actors from back in those days. The shows come in crystal clear. For anyone who wishes to sit back, relax, and enjoy a good night of top notch entertainment, Columbo is the series you want to see! You WON'T be disappointed! :-)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm realllllllly glad i got this game it's so much definitely my favorite game on my fire and i have lots lots and lots and lots and lots of games i mean loads<br />I &lt;3 this game
B008J34466|5.0|Lots of talent in this record. She has the vibe and talent to deliver always great performances. Worth having it
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|love match games and this is one of the best. fun graphics, great on my kindle fire, easy to use.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I love watching how it all began! They look so young and innocent. My prime membership lets me watch it all for free!
1449410243|5.0|This book is highly recommended for cat lovers/owners. If you have a cat, you'll find the humor in the literature.<br />Glad I bought the book!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone. It has a lot of twists that u don't expect but it is a very good read.
B002YVAT72|5.0|I bought this as a gift and it is used often and has great sound. The price was great too compared to some other products out there.
B0084BM7GW|5.0|Love, Love, Love this band. Terrific DVD & CD. Top Tier package for all to enjoy. I would not hesitate to order again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captivating story keeps you glued to the book wanting to continue reading.  A strange story to think about but great once you start.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  My relatives were from Ulster.  There were times when I could hear them saying some of the phrases that were written in the book.  I spent a lot of the time laughing through the book.
B00000DCHI|4.0|It's really good, works really good, but it came in late and I really don't like it when that happens.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I absolutely loved the CD.  I very seldom buy CD's because most of the songs are repeats from other CD's.  This GrobanI CD has far s I know is an original one, and the first he has done in a few years .
1439130833|5.0|I absolutely love this thing. Each day I tear off the days message and keep it with me to pull out throughout the day. If you are into the Secret get this.
B00755646W|4.0|3 stars ONLY because of the Blu-ray simplicity. This documentary is fascinating. Madonna is definitely the BEST female performer of all time. But this Blu-ray release has nothing special. No extras, no deleted scenes, no additional performances...
1439181780|5.0|This has become my all time favorite book. I loved the Secret so I figured this would be more of the same and to an extent it is but there's enough new content to distinguish it. I feel like the message here is slightly different. I can't recommend it enough.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Thanks HBO for this original series. Shocking, great story, great actors, best theme song ever. I wouldn't expect anything less.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best thing ever! I could spend all day on it! I love how it has so many categories to choose from to look at!
0770435726|5.0|Here's a winner. Complicated plot full of uncanny coincidences. Good characterizations and<br />more or less believable. Recommended for its evocation of interesting locale.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Brandon Sanderson can spin a yarn. This is an interesting take on what happens after Darth Vader through the Emperor down the well, after the freedom fighters preserve beyond all odds after good triumphs over evil oppression. Full of politics, action, adventure, suspense, and even some tragedy. By the end of the Siege of Luthadel, we are once again reminded that the characters are mortal, and I am almost afraid to read Hero of Ages because characters I have formed connections with may be lost.  Fantastic storytelling, no wonder Harriett McDougal invited young Mr. Sanderson finish Robert Jordon's work.
B009DT9DBQ|1.0|First of all, let me say that the band's performance on this album is fantastic.  It was also professionally recorded, so it sounds great.  Not to mention, the records are a cool green color and the triple gatefold cover is filled with fantastic photos.  No complaints there.  That being said, if you're interested in buying the 3-disc vinyl edition of this album, think again.  The last song on each side of all 3 discs is cut off!  They apparently didn't have room on each disc for all the songs, so they just cut the last one short on each side, for a total of 6 songs being cut off (one of which is Slash's guitar solo)!  That is absolutely inexcusable for any record manufacturer/pressing company.  I've always preferred the fuller analog sounds of vinyl, but in this instance, I think I should return the vinyl and just stick with the CD.  How could the record company have overlooked something like that?  It would be nice if they repressed it, but I doubt that we'll be that lucky.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Our viewing of video that we paid for quit playing near beginning of movie.  This was a 'gift' for my boyfriend. boo hoo!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This is a definite 5 star book.It`s one of the best Diary of a Wimpy Kid books yet.If I could rate more stars I would!
B009KEN87O|5.0|i dont know much about retro being 14 but i do know a good game and this is a good game! worth every penny
B0094K1QR8|5.0|This is a nice distraction for a couple hours. Natalie Portman's performance is spectacular.  We all enjoyed it very much.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Fast paced, unpredictable and one hell of ride with Mr. and Mrs. John Corey. This is a beginning to end thrill ride that will never disappoint John Corey fans.
B004ZN9NCY|4.0|There are a lot of Pink Floyd fans who really don't like this album. I suppose if you came to Floyd late, I can see it. The ones that review this album favorably, understand the work and there are very good insights on this album to be read in them.<br />But back when this came out, it was groundbreaking on many levels, and really shows Pink Floyd at their most experimental. Young English lads, pushing the envelope. Some even complain the live album sounds like the studio takes, but in many ways that was what was incredible; that they captured everything so well live; especially given the visionary nature of their music, when most bands couldn't even come close to their more mundane studio performances.<br />I heard this album at a friends house, blacklit and incense fogged, and was blown through the roof. I bought it immediately, and it remained THE Pink Floyd effort for me until Meddle came out.<br />I saw Pink Floyd in concert shortly after this album came out, in a small venue: the Salem Armory in Oregon State. They truly brought the songs to life in the same way, like I was hearing my treasured LP 'in person'. I am grateful that I was able to see them so up close and personal. I couldn't take my eyes off of David Gilmour nor Nick Mason. Each so exceptional in their mastery, and Gilmour coaxing sounds out of a guitar that had never been heard before. I'll never forget Nick Mason's gong exploding in a circle of fire at the conclusion of a bombastic passage. To me, the live album is really a must for any FLoyd fan because it is the rare recorded concert experience, and they're all songs that they might pull out of their hat in later concerts.<br />If you were there, you'd know that Pink Floyd was still 'in the minors' at this point  ... a couple of years away from Dark Side of the Moon.<br />There were more than a few adulterated evenings laying back and absorbing the Narrow Way, to me not to be overlooked by fans, a Gilmour masterpiece. The classical nature of Sysyphus shows Richard Wrights complex notions of composition ... and when listened to was much like a soundtrack that generated its own artwork. My visions were never the same, but always grand.  Granchester Meadows is another Pink Floyd masterpiece. The wonderful acoustic nature of it was absorbing and satisfying, and the conclusion a brilliant stroke. There is a special place in my heart for \\"Several Small Species ...\\" as well. I don't know why the rant is so gratifying, and the payoff at the end in scottish brogue never ceased to be a humorous relief. I appreciate where the band went, and why they went there. This kind of innovation doesn't come from having a commercial maw to feed, and nobody was developing songs like this. They had cornered an interstellar place in the rock world, and many bands would struggle to catch up.<br />I saw them again during the \\"Dark Side ...\\" concert tour. They had picked up a considerable following after Meddle, and all of us fans devoured Dark Side of the Moon for the classic work that it is. To me, the hallmark of their career. The concert itself proved yet again their ability to bring the studio to the stage as they rendered another stellar live recreation of their recorded work.<br />Yes, you would have had to been there. But as a young college student, Ummagumma was the first Floyd album I owned. I had 'See Emily Play' on '45, lost long ago. So it is memorable. Maybe if you didn't have those memories it wouldn't have the same appeal. But if you were raised on classical music as I was, you will hear the drama and inventiveness of this album and appreciate it for what it is and when it was presented.<br />The album can still transport ... but I suppose maybe you would have had to been there.syphus shows Richard Wrights complex notions of composition ... and when listened to was much like a soundtrack that generated its own artwork.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I'm hooked! There are so many puzzles and they are challenging. It froze up on me one time, but not sure whether it was the app or my Kindle Fire. There are ads that pop up after completion of a puzzle, but you just close it and go straight back to the game. The ads do not bother me at all.
B005K17RU0|1.0|i dislike the New update, looks like its time to uninstall and stick with the weather channel app.  i think that's the only way to stop this battery vampire app anyway.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very sad to see the novel end. Great plot. Great character development. Twisted rollercoaster ride of emotion. Hopefully another book to follow!
1932907009|3.0|I was recommended this book since it can work for any kind of creative writing--not just screenwriting. It does have a lot of good information that really changed the way I looked at my writing process. The outline he lays out is pretty damn good, and I've made my own that I follow pretty religiously. His processes and formulas have some truth to them and should definitely be dwelt upon, and also taken with a grain of salt at the same time.<br /><br />I understand that he's really good at what he does, or at least so I'm told. So I'm not going to balk at someone who's successful at what they do and shun their advice. At the same time, I have a hard time taking advice from someone whose claims to fame are \\"Blank Check\\" and \\"Stop or My Mom Will Shoot\\". I also don't see eye to eye with him on his harsh views of \\"Memento\\" and absolute praise of \\"Legally Blonde.\\"<br /><br />You have to understand, this is a book on how to write a screenplay that has a better chance of being sold. These aren't instructions on how to make a groundbreaking, artistic masterpiece. But, I would definitely suggest this book to anyone else who has a career in any kind of creative writing, or hopes to. There's a lot of good information here, even if I don't agree with the author's opinions on things.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Loses a star for lack of originality and the minor glitch of not removing a set if you go too fast (falls with the next set hence it's minor) but it's otherwise very well done.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was not only funny but intimate and romantic. Filled with tons of ups and down and not just between the bed sheet!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, can't wait for the next to come out, great graphics and good storyline. Bring it on.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|The story is cheese but once you get past that this game is fun. This game is similar to Jewel Quest &amp; Bejeweled, but you have different obstacles to get past in order to move objects down the jeweled board to beat each level. I like playing this because each country gets increasingly more difficult making for some challenge and their is a 3 star rating you earn for each level you pass so one could go back and try to get a better score on any given level once they beat the game.
1608871517|5.0|I'm so glad I purchased this book! It has been beautifully written and put together. Everything about the book itself is beautiful, and what it contains, even moreso. I was completely caught up in each of the stories shared. I loved seeing the up close details of the various pieces of clothing - they were amazing. As a fan of Michael Jackson (both of his work & him as a person), it was lovely to read the words of someone who worked with him for so many years. I feel like I own a treasure in this book. I will cherish it for years to come. Thank you Mr. Bush for such a beautiful book. God bless your soul & rest in peace, Michael Jackson.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is worth a look see.  I quickly became engrossed in this wonderful period dramas. Only Downton Abbey can rivel it's quality.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This is an excellent comedy of errors revolving around a funeral. Because there are some very adult topics, and profanity, I do not recommend it for kids.

B003L77G06|5.0|what an amazing cast...I watch this dvd before i go to sleep at night..i always burst out laughing my face off .  I can't wait for the next season to be released.  thank you
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the best, if not the best book I have ever read. It was amazingly clever and an exelent idea. It can be a bit intense at times, but if you're 15 or over, you'll be fine.<br /><br />Read this book. It's up there with A Game of Thrones and The 13th Tale, both of which you should also read.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|this cast is so funny...I discovered this show and have become a loyal viewer ever since..ed makes me laugh so hard..he was great as al bundy and great as jay pritcher..amazing..thank you
B006LSZECO|3.0|Almost the entire book was hard to put down- pretty suspenseful and some interesting twists.  That is why I was so disappointed by the end, very anti climatic.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|An absolutely great movie. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have two outstanding performances for which Lawrence won the Best Actress Oscar, not too mention the supporting jobs done by Robert De Niro, Jackie Weaver, Chris Tucker and many others.<br /><br />Set in Philadelphia, the movie shows Pat Solitano (Cooper) returning home from a stint in a mental institution after a domestic incident with his ex-wife highlighted his struggle with bipolar mood swings. Pat moves back in with his parents (De Niro and Weaver) as her tries to get his life back together, hoping to reunite with his ex-wife. Things get very interesting when Pat meets Tiffany (Lawrence), a young woman with issues of her own.<br /><br />If nothing more, the movie shows that life is not always perfect. Things can get out of control and spiral. All the same, with family and friends in our lives, it's always worth moving forward.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. Very emotional book that will make you both laugh and cry. Colleen Hoover is my new favorite.

0385738781|2.0|It was a Okay book but felt a little slow and the end was indecisive and hard to understand. The sudden ending was disappointing  compared to the rest of the books in the series and felt the ending was rushed, as if the author forgot the questions he brought up when writing the story and chose to avoid all of them. The chancellor was not even introduced and Teresa seemed to be forgotten very easily considering her impact on the story. I know this for sure this story is incomplete and has unfortunately has been left to the reader to consider the rest.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|I came across Jose James completely by accident. One of my Pandora stations played Code from Blackmagic which stopped me in my tracks. While Blackmagic is great in its own right some of the songs are frankly hard to listen to. No Beginning No End is different in that regard - each song is a stunner. Have you ever listened to music and had tingling in your nerve endings and sharpness in your jaw? James does that to me. James is like a vocal Thelonious Monk, voicing rhythms and syncopations that are beyond the pale of virtually anything that most of us have heard. As such, he will not be liked by all. Regardless, I liken him to Cassandra Wilson and her unique way of phrasing. Yet Jose James is a singular voice, a singular talent. In an era where noise passes as music, where personality passes as talent Jose James shows us what it is to have command over voice and rhythm. Listen and be rewarded.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The books were so good! Filled with love, action, and true feelings. You really feel like you're part of the story. The ending could have been better though.

B005LAII80|4.0|I have no knowledge of this character other than I think I saw the 90's version show.  Obviously, that version was forgettable.<br /><br />Folks who require \\"character development,\\" and other \\"story items\\" will not enjoy this watch.  There are no tiresome speeches and needless dialogue.<br /><br />Those of you who delight in main characters who are masters of brevity and seem to find rules simple, will.<br /><br />Strangely to many I bet, I thought the characters and storyline were developed very well and more importantly, efficiently.  By the end, you will know everything about Dredd (and most others) you need and want to know.<br /><br />Poor an adult beverage and just enjoy this one.  Life can often be simple.

B0083GQ2A0|3.0|THE GREY seems like a ho-hum [[ASIN:B005FDWAXM Alive]] rip-off for most of its first half, but things pick up and at least start to go in some interesting directions during the second. Nesson gives a commendable performance as professional wolf killer Ottway. Even though we don't know either of them well enough for it to be really meaningful, the way his estranged wife acts as a guardian angel to him is an interesting conceit. Realistic oil roughneck acting and dialogue despite the fact that most of the supporting characters tend to run together and, plane crash notwithstanding, seldom complete a sentence without two or three f-bombs.<br /><br />This film is undeniably realistic in many ways; in many others, it's very unconvincing. It's tense and compelling thanks mostly to fine camera work and stage directions, but there are a number of annoying short-cuts and cop-outs. The best aspect of THE GREY is its forbiddingly beautiful Alaskan scenery--the cinematography really outshines the plot. Though I didn't care much for the ending, I have to say that it is both surprising and fitting for this film's whole Hemingwayesque tone and atmosphere (humankind against the dispassionate wild and all that sort of stuff). For all its mediocrity, I have to say that I'm glad I saw THE GREY.<br /><br />--The Deleted Scenes, some of which should not have been deleted, are worth a look afterward.<br /><br />--For a couple of other (better) films along this line, check out [[ASIN:B0012FHGCW Into the Wild]] and [[ASIN:B0012HQKZE The Edge]].

B007IXWKUK|2.0|But I hoped considering more than this. Unrealistic even for a fantasy novel, annoying characters, poorly written if the sex scenes became gratuitous. I finished for one reason, because I started it. I will not read the last book in this trilogy. I do not condemn any one who enjoys the writings of E L James. It just isn't my cup of tea. Laters baby! Ugh!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a great time waster!! It's a lot of fun and actually quite challenging. I highly recommend this game!!

We tried this one while free... and went and bought that other one.<br /><br />Perhaps this app could have been fun...  but the fact that the strokes are drawn constantly slows the app to a crawl after a few lines.  This app could have used a bit more development and features...
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is by far, the best a sequel can get.It was well paced, suspenseful, and had you hungry for the next book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Some things are really expensive in game though.<br />But other than that, I love this game a lot because it's very fun to play when I'm bored or teavelling

B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is great. It really is, but it reeaaalllyyy needs an upgrade cause this is nothing like other versions.<br />Pros: 1.Is fun and simple to play 2. Can play anywhere you have your kindle. 3. Has endless hours of playing<br />Cons: 1. Does not have online, is only local 2. NEEDS to have an update, it doesn't have things like caverns, buckets, or boats 3. Cannot set things on fire.<br />Hopes this helps :-)

B00AZNEW5G|3.0|My husband & I watched this last night & our thought was: Why all the hype over this movie?  If they could have done this in an hour & a half, it would have been much better. It just drug on & on.  I was disappointed to see that we as a nation torture people but not surprised considering we are such a barbaric society.  All in all, I wish I hadn't watched it. I don't believe Bin Laden is dead & it's interesting that there is no body, since he was supposedly buried at sea.  He would be much more valuable alive.
B002SR2PKG|3.0|Way too much backstory. Not enough terror to keep you moving through the books shear length. Seemed too self-indulgent for me.

Tried numerous software solutions but was always wasting paper. The final push to purchase the unit came when a client wanted three 5x7 prints… the process should have only taken me 5 minutes, but after correcting the color by trial and error took me 3 hours!!! After profiling my paper stock with my ink brand “Hobbicolors” print are consistently coming out great.<br />… No more wasting paper…..

O.K you got me. found out the terrible secret of the deepest hollow of my heart that I DID NOT &#34;scoop&#34; the book up. who even has a ice cream scoop. Well the main point of that rediculous paragrph that I picked up the book and read. nd read. and then read. then strech my leges while read. read some more. &#34;ohh, that Hera is horrible. gives us a nonsense clue that we &#34;already know&#34; and being nice still, blehg, and then the peanut butter sandwhiches go &#34;poof&#34;- exageration of Annabeth. may not, no CORECTION, WILL not make any sense to those who have not read this book I am revewing.<br /><br />Everyone is in this book with grover, tyson (big guy! ), annabeth and percy are leaving the sunshine and daisys of Camp half blood for the mind defying labyrinth in a journy to find daedulus to help destroy the entrance in the vunreble place in the woods before luke and his army destroys camp with a terrifying army of monsters and creatures not seen out of the pit of tartarus for centuries, by using that entrance as a portal past the boundarys of thalias tree and the golden fleece.<br /><br /> (  !!  )<br /> ( *  *)  sunshine daisys,<br /><br />&#62;&#62;&#62;-----------&#62; =====this was a boohyah!!? and Sophia Studios production.<br /><br />And remember children, LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT AND YOU MAKE IT ROCK!!<br /><br />and ten year olds can be ultimatly mega magma rulers of marshmallows.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|When I first got this app, I was skeptical. But it has great graphics, smooth gameplay, and a fun racecourse. Don't be discouraged by the fact it only has one track, it is HUGE. There are five different<br />enviroments (including the one you start in) and I've only found one of them. 5 out of 5.
B003PIUC02|5.0|You can almost feel as if Spartacus was there.  This is a introduction of an somewhat account to spartacus life as we know from the history writers that were there. This all happened around 70 - 72 BC. The effects of the fight scenes are really epic along with how the romans actually lived according to what we know in history.<br /><br />This series also shows Andy's great acting ablities which left his legacy as Spartaucs in the frist season.<br /><br />.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I hated the hunger games movie. I think it was because i was a new mom when it came out. But i heard so many things about the books, i picked them up. After looking at this trilogy a few ways- i realize this isnt supposed to be a love story, but a story of human will and strength. Its a good book. You just have to look at the underlying message. Still suspensful.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This is an older series than Downton Abbey. The characters are not as richly developed; I could predict their responses to conflicts after the first episode. I began to feel a bit tired of the scenes always within the same townhouse rooms. It was fine for an older BBC production, but I did not feel as involved with the characters as I did with Downton Abbey.
1476734941|3.0|One month down and 11 pounds gone! I love this diet! I tell myself I can do this for a day cause there is always tomorrow. But the meal plans leave some things to be desired. Alot of the meal plans are based upon the 600 calorie Male meal plan. So I am always trying to figure out what I need to cut for the day in comparison to my husband who is also on the diet. I don't have fresh figs, tuna sashimi, Ryvita crackers, mackerel fillets, etc. at my grocery store. The caloric content of some items are off. I was making the Tuna, Bean and Garlic salad. The recipe calls for 1-1/2 cups canellini beans. (108 calories). On the Progresso can it reads 1/2 cup serving 110 calories. If I had followed the recipe I would have been 220 calories over for the day just on beans. The chicken recipe on the cover of the book is very good. We are now looking for alternative meal plans to continue this diet.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Mikes book on building lean muscle. His experience with weight training comes through and his honesty about the commercialized health industry is refreshing.<br /><br />The largest portion of the book deals with the importance of diet and sleep and the science of why those are up 80% of the battle.<br /><br />There aren't any shortcuts offered here. However what is offered is a clear, realistic guide to bulk up, cut down, or maintain.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who may be looking for a practical guide of how to add healthy, lean muscle.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Excellent 3D Graphics bring the Trains and Terrain to life.  You act as a Train Traffic Controller by Planning train movements, Switching tracks for turns and using Traffic lights to avoid crashes.<br />You have to get Colored Trains to the Train stations that match their exact color to beat each level.<br />It is very well designed with just enough progressive difficulty to keep you challenged and engaged.<br /><br />* HD 3D Graphics are exceptional, making Trains and Countryside Vibrantly Realistic.<br />* Music and train Sound Effects are perfect to set the atmosphere and add to the fun.<br />* Instructions during first levels of game give you a good Tutorial on how to play properly.<br />* All movements are Smooth and Realistic.  Train CRASHES make quite a bang too (ha-ha).<br />* Challenges are great to give your Reflexes, Logic and Planning Skills a workout.<br />* All controls work very well and Smoothly.  Very nice appearance and function on a Tablet.<br /><br />Overall: A wonderful Train Traffic app that keeps you engaged with realistic challenges including use of Traffic Lights with a 5 second delay and switching many track intersections quickly and accurately.<br />Train Enthusiasts and Puzzle Lovers should enjoy the challenges and awesome graphics of this game.<br />It does take up a large amount of memory but the stunning graphics probably require that.  It has good Replay Value and I would recommend it to a anyone who likes mechanical puzzle challenges.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book.  It is wonderfully written and a real eye opener.  This kind of abuse goes on daily around us and to read a story about it in detail puts it into perspective.  I could not put it down, and the end really gave me goose bumps!!  This is a must read.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Every detail in the film and everything about it by supervision of master filmmaker Steven Spielberg is fantastic. This is a truly masterpiece of all time. It is Liam, Ben and Ralph's best acting.

I especially love the recipes<br />that are included so you can get started.  A hard copy would be easier to go back and refer to sections<br /> I want to reread. Best Buy ever!  I have already bought 3 more copies and sent them to family members!<br />I wuld give this book 10 stars if it were possible!
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This is a great free game, you don't have to spend any money to play... just play it for a few minutes every couple of hours... it is the kind of game you play while on a break. This works just fine on my kindle fire.

However, there a couple of the games that I don't understand therefore the 4 stars instead of five.....it is impossible to kill some of the birds even when you hit them, so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but that makes it frustrating.  Still a lot of fun....

B004OC07N0|5.0|Full of interesting insights and provides a systematic approach to taking up a new role.<br />I have read the first 30% of the book and it has already been worth the money.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|The very first movie in the series and in my opinion the best one so I didn't want to buy the whole series I just wanted this one and was glad I was able to purchase it singly. I still enjoy this movie no matter how many times I watch it - It is always so entertaining.
1452113432|5.0|The recipes are unique but simple. I wish I could transport myself into Rachel's flat.  I am thrilled with my purchase.
1842157051|5.0|I was greatly amazed how easy these projects were to do and how simple!  with just a few folds a few snips or cuts and the coolest designs emerged. It's fun to practice all the different angles to see what I come up with, the imagination is limitless. Thanks for a great book !!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It took me a while to read this book, only because of my schedule but if I had had my way I would have sat down and not stopped reading until I reached the last page. Kennedy's death happened during my lifetime, although I was young, and I lived in Dallas when it happened. The idea of someone changing the course of history, plus the ripple effects of that change, is fascinating and King did an incredible job of weaving together &#34;just the facts&#34; and the fictional story of the man who returns to a time before he was born. That part appeals to my interest in history and a wish that I could see things as they were during that time, as well. The main character has the patience, resourcefulness and strength needed for such a journey and I enjoyed reliving the era through King's descriptions of even the most minute details. The resolution of the story of a trip back through the rabbit hole was not disappointing although I expected a different ending. I highly recommend this book for fans of fiction blended with the facts of history, for those who lived during 1963 and for Stephen King fans, who will continue to appreciate his thoroughness of research and his high-quality writing.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I will never get tired of this movie. I have watched the movie many times over the years on the old VHS tapes but as those tapes go bad after a while I wanted to get the set on DVD. It was much clearer then the VHS quality and will hopefully last a lot longer. I hope so  because this is such a great movie and a great set to have forever.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|There is a wide range of sounds. It would be impossible to not be pleased with the selection. I, especially love the boat creaking one.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|It is a good soundtrack. If you loved the movie you will love playing the soundtrack over and over again.
B009329Y30|1.0|I down loaded this for a plane trip on my kindle and when I went to play it nothing was there , even though I watched it down load , after i got off the plane it showed that i had watched the whole movie in full which was impossible since i watched another movie
B00127RAJY|5.0|I use it almost every day. It is tailored to those just starting out but it is also good for those who have a different intensity level. I don't like the music they play so I mute the video and play my own music.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|Great music, lively and entertaining.  Enjoyed all the songs on this cd.  Good voice, and great choices for songs. Thank you.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|This movie was good and may have even been great had I not read and loved the book so much first. Would recommend to a friend.
B000002H6Q|4.0|Received the CD today. The CD itself looks good but the inside jacket looks like it had gotten wet before and the pages were slightly stuck together which is fine as long as the CD plays well. I won't have time to play it until later but I am sure that it will play fine! Thank you!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very touching and so real. I loved this book couldn't put it down. One of the best books by far.
B000007ODL|5.0|I had owned one of JJ Cale's older albums and I just could not remember how Great a musician he was and still is.<br />You cannot go wrong with this purchase!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|this is a perfect game for me. I would give it five stars but its real buggy on my kindle fire.
B003C1AL94|5.0|Continuum has always been one of my favorite John Mayer albums, but hearing it on vinyl made me feel like I was listening to it for the first time. This vinyl release is of very high quality and I highly recommend fans of his to purchase this album on vinyl.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's not a as easy as it looks. I would recommend this game yo snyone. Try it you'll love it
B009NT0I06|5.0|Red is an excellent album, I would recommend to music lovers of all genres. Hearing the album on vinyl took it to another level, it was like I was listening to the album for the first time. So get yourself a record player and a copy of this album on vinyl, you won't be disappointed!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Hello guys I just love this awesome game!!!! But I think there should be a change between the time to build, to grow dinosaurs &amp; prices on everything. It's just insane!!!! I'm pretty sure that most of us will enjoy better this game without paying a lot for things and if that can't change at least we should get back better reward after every mission we had done. But, again, I love this game. Thanks for your time!!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun game to pass the time.  Reminds me of the space shooters in the arcades 20 years ago.  Like the old style graphics.

0765325950|5.0|Every so often I read a book that sweeps me away in its scope and depth of story-telling.  This is such a book.  Without giving away any spoilers, I will tell you that all the characters from the \\"Wheel of Time\\" saga are here and they each have a special role to play as the Last Battle finally begins.  Jordan/Sanderson keeps all the threads of the story running together perfectly!  All \\"surprises\\" are wonderfully foreshadowed.  The reader sees bravery and betrayal, love, loyalty, and loss.  There were parts I read with tears rolling down my face and parts when I wanted to stand up and cheer!  Back in 1990 I first opened \\"The Eye of the World\\" and was caught up in a believable world with deep, multi-dimensional characters.  Now, over 20 years later, the conclusion to that story is powerful and stunning!  Bravo!  Thank you, Mr. Jordan for your vision.  Thank you, Mr. Sanderson for picking up the vision and carrying it through.
B004498KPU|5.0|I  love this product.It's an insight at the king of pop in work and in his vision.i really recommend this to any micheal jackson fan.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game it is so fun but thanks to my cousin Bc I saw her playing and then i got the game so yea lol!!!!!!
159562015X|4.0|This books has two things going for it right out of the gate; an effective cover and a non-threatening size.  At only 174 pages it does not intimidate.  If you lend this book out it will actually be read.  Illuminated within the work is a conceptual revolution with great potential for both employees and employers.<br /><br />Mr. Tom Rath has written an excellent-- and short-- proclamation to cease our misguided efforts at focusing on our weaknesses.  The evidence he presents supports a thesis of focusing on our strengths instead.  Quit banging your head against the wall; start focusing on what you enjoy and what you do best.  The messages is eminently liberating.<br /><br />Included is an access code that allows you to take an online personality test that will provide a list of your top five strengths.  This report is a tool that you can use on a personal and on a professional level.  Because the book includes a list of all 34 personality traits you can begin to notice these traits in your employees.  If your boss (or the company CEO) is receptive then lend him this book.  It's a short book, so even the CEO will have time to read it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love the story line and can,t wait for the movie. I'm thinking it's going to be the next twilight and more
B009KEN87O|4.0|this game is obviously based on space invaders,  but with a twist. it has 3 difficulty modes. the graphics are great
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I like it. More, more, more...<br />Give me more. Great game.<br />Please no ads, ruins the fun.<br />More mahjong please.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A must read if you're looking for a behind the scenes look at war and conflicts and the men make the sacrifices
B008JIWNYG|5.0|Glad I got this. Now I need to go backwards and read all of green lantern from the start. I highly recommend this
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I haven't. used evermore that long, but so far I absolutely love it! I. just bought a new tablet and I love being able to sync all my notes, so everything is always in one place! No more leaving my grocery list at home.  I am a diabetic and. ow have even started using it to log my blood sugars.  I. can now keep track of the time I took it and the amount of insulting I took, as well as any notes,  etc.  The possibilities are endless!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is good not great but good.  This game  is entertaining for a little while but then you lose interest.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I like it it's fun . I love it. I really like it .The game is really fun.And I like the creative mode.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great read. I would recommend every adult read this book. I only took four days to read this cover to cover. And did not want to put it down.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|I had been looking forward to a quiet night to watch this film.<br />The production is extremely stylized, like a living stage using trite dialogue to justify the ornate set decoration.<br />I had to shut it off during the ballroom scene.<br />The choppy edits and spinning characters (with synchronized flailing arms) made me feel unusually confused and dizzy.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I was eager to see this movie though I was a fan of the 'Arny' version. This version is SOOOOO much better. Not campy, very gritty and real (for a sci-fi). This version made me want to read the short story by Philip K. Dick. Very enjoyable movie.
B000NY12LO|4.0|A reader often just feels for the families of the victims in a school shooting, not the shooter's family. This book approaches the families feelings and quest for why their son could have done such a reprehensible thing.
B008N1LL42|3.0|Special effects were incredible! Everything else was predictable, blase'. The movie was okay but the story was not original. There is a knock-off out there that is nearly as good as this one with (i would guess) a much smaller budget. Still, I enjoyed watching the movie and will probably watch it again someday.
B0085W09ME|5.0|I have not used it yet and therefore cannot rate it--I hope it comes in handy and lists good prices.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I resisted watching this as I grew up watching the original. That being said, this version was very, very entertaining. Very dark humor, Johnny Depp, Tim Burton. Enjoyed the movie a lot!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It was working fine, and I had just reached level 8, but then when I tried to open it, it would go back to my home screen. I tried shutting down my kindle and even a reset, but it still wouldn't open. I also tried clearing the data in Settings&gt;Applications, then finally I uninstalled it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Yes, the DVDs have the original music. I am a fan and am not here to debate the quality of the show itself. Amazon requires I write more words for a review, so I will note that if you watch the first season streaming here or on Netflix, the classic rock that really sets the tone for the show is replaced by crappy wannabe hair bands that no one has ever heard of. So I purchased the DVDs of season one just so I could watch the show as it was intended. I got the non-HD on DVD, despite having a BluRay player and a 51\\" screen and I think it looks great. The widescreen ratio looks just right on my widescreen TV :)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a really good movie and there are rarely any good movies anymore  and also really good acting movies these days BRAVO BEN AFFLECK!!!
0071762345|5.0|This book is wonderful for business owners who just aren't sure how to tackle the daunting world of social media.  It's funny, real, and easy to understand.  Loved it!
B00BFHZOCG|4.0|This is a good cover album, but it feels like it is lacking. The album would have felt more complete with a couple more songs. I really wish they would have done some John Bush era re-recordings (a reverse of \\"The Greater of Two Evils\\"). The \\"Crawl (Remix)\\" is nothing special and the album version off \\"Worship Music\\" is unchanged. Stand out cover tracks are Boston's \\"Smokin'\\" and Journey's \\"Keep on Runnin'\\". Overall, I would recommend purchasing \\"Anthems\\" for any Anthrax fan who needs something to hold them over till a new album.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This is by far the best Duane Allman (ABB) collection I have ever seen, I haven't heard some of this music for years, \\"Loan Me A Dime\\" is exquisite. My Allman Brothers collection primarily is 1972 and earlier, Ludlows Garage, Atlanta music Festivial....etc, and this tops off the collection for me.  I just love this box set. Most casual fans of the ABB had no clue how much session work this man did in such a short time, a truly gifted and talented artist cut short, we will never know what he may have accomplished, but what he did accomplish is just true genius. I can't thank  Galadrielle and Bill Levenson enough, this is just really a masterpiece.  All you hard core fans, better get one before there gone, glad I got mine, now we just want some video, PLEASE....... Again, thank you.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love this app its a lot of fun! great for children and very addicting for adults! try it out now!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This new Kindle Fire charging system is excellent and for the first time, the new plug fits the power charging location on my Kindle without the &#34;wiggle factor&#34; that has been so annoying and problematic since the first days of use. When my Kindle stopped charging last weekend, I was devastated. Thanks, Amazon service department, for sending me this new charging system because it has revived my Dec 2011 Kindle Fire to &#34;good as new&#34;. I'm addicted to reading at night with my kindle, find the entire Amazon Kindle purchase process so good with books. Happy Amazon.cm user, happy Kindle Fire user.
0440245206|1.0|One cold and miserable Sunday afternoon I was browsing amazon kindle books on my newly aquired I pad  with the intention of downloading a book to my kindle to help pass the time. As I have read many DS books was glancing through a couple of her books and I accidently bought Hotel Vendome. Well seeing as I had spent between £4 and £5 and not wanting to waste my money I commenced reading. Three weeks later I am up to 39% ( I am not a slow reader when I am interested in a book, but this book is so badly written its like it been written by a child). It lacks substance and quality, this is how I ended up writing this. Most of the DS books I have read are excellent and she is in my mind an author who researches her writing with a passion. For example the books I have read such as Echoes and Message from Nam and Jewels Granny Dan, she really does her research and makes you believe in the characters, and she creates atmosphere and emotion in her story telling and you feel you can escape into another world. However in my mind it would appear that this book was written in one night, probably feeling bored while she was staying at some exclusive hotel such as the Ritz.
0062238868|3.0|book started out really exciting but for me kinda leveled off. good read would recommend if you enjoy guns and war.
B007REV4T8|5.0|A true thrill ride from beginning to end. This one is perhaps the best Bond of the last half century of Bond films. Daniel Craig portrays James Bond as he lives through the demise of MI6 to become the last surviving double-O. He brings down a loose cannon agent who turned against his country (recycled plot from GoldenEye) and sought revenge against &#34;M&#34; and the entire MI6 agency.<br /><br />Dame Judy Dentch makes her last appearance as Bond's boss, and like Pierce Brosnan did in &#34;The World Is Not Enough&#34;, Bond has to risk his life to save &#34;M&#34;, only to lose her near the end to her combat wounds. It's funny how Bond can get shot by Money Penny and survive, but &#34;M&#34; dies from a little flesh wound in the side. I also thought MI6 could have sent in some Royal reinforements to fend off two waves of commando's that came against Bond, &#34;M&#34;, and the caretaker of the Skyfall estate.  But then it might not have been as dramatic.<br /><br />Adele's Academy award-winning theme song adds to my growing collection of Bond movie music.  It is good to have the Bond series return to the style of music of the earlier films. The theme song selections for Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace were not so good.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie version of the worldwide smash musical respects its source material yet finds ways to fit the personal stories into the canvas of a historical epic. Well-cast, with direction that is old-fashioned in the best sense, it most reminds me of another great period musical adaptation, the 1968 Oliver!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|great time passer.  addictive.  we keep trying to get three stars.  we really like it.<br />look foward to free time.  kids like it too.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I seriously didn't think it would be all that fun. But wow...amazing! Great 3d effects and a decent challenge. This game will hold me for a while
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The entire series is extraordinary. Good storylines. Good casting. Excellent performances. Great cinematography. We would recommend this to anyone. We'll be sure to order season three.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|OMG this is the best series ever written I'm am extreme hunger games fan I have read the series 3 times in 8 months ( I'm a fast reader ) and I watch the movie every time I'm in the car and every weekend. I can't wait til catching fire comes out I can't wait to see it I love Finnick Odair and Peeta Mellark and Katniss is my idol. In mockingjay I was so happy for finnick an d Annie when they got married and I was so sad when he died and I was torn apart when prim died and I almost cried when katniss was yelling at buttercup that prim was dead . I loved the part where Peeta asked katniss you love me real or not real and she told him real. I'm so glad Suzanne Collins wrote these books they tell  a wonderful story and they 're very interesting. I'm in 7th grade and I would rather watch the Hunger games with my friends then go to the skating rink any day. I love books that are scary and have Gore in it and these books had a lot of Gore in it and it was soooooo detailed and I love it. I even had a hunger games themed birthday party and I even have a few walls that have hunger games stuff all over them in my room. :-D    P.s. if you are looking for something creepy to read then go to [...]  Sincerely, #1 hunger games fan
B00BWJARHO|2.0|As the title suggests, this movie bored me. I made it through the first of half of the film before I decided I was wasting my time with this one. It's nowhere near as interesting as the Lord of The Rings trilogy, and it seems to be much too childish in its theme. I wouldn't personally recommend it, but almost everyone else I have talked to has enjoyed it. I guess the experience is just going to be different for everyone.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really liked this book it was better than I had thought it would be. It was full of adventure and the story was so detailed and I can't wait to read the next book in the series. I'm only in 7th grade and I didn't really know who some of the gods were and I didn't know how to pronounce some of their names and before I read the book I watched some of the movie and it was really good but I wasn't sure if I should read the book or not because I wasn't really interested in Greek mythology and I didn't really understand it. But I'm glad I read it and I can't wait to read the next book I hope it is as awesome as this  one was. It's not my favorite book though because I'm an extreme Hunger Games fan. I have read the Hunger games series 3 times in about 8 months ( I'm a fast reader ) an  I was gonna read them again by  my mom told me to read a different book and my dad told me I should try the Percy Jackson books by  I was a little worried about reading it because I like scary books with a lot of death and Gore but I was glad I read it because it was good. Rick Riordan did a really good job with this book and I'm so look glad he wrote it. ( Btw if you are looking for some creepy stories go to [...] they are really good stories )<br />  Sincerely, #1 hunger games fan :-D
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|This book wraps up Ivan's storyline quite well. As always a great read from Bujold. It varies the stereotypes in most the groups that have gone before. Very glad for the Ivan and Tej combination.
B007MG360G|5.0|This was a cool game just add more elements like in Doodle devil and sort of combine all of the games together to make one taint awesome game
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I didn't enjoy this book. a) I didn't think it was well written, b) It was a story about a very abusive relationship that... had a happy ending. I found the message disturbing. Like... the abuse was condoned by the happy ending. \\"Stick with your abusive relationship and you, too, will get a giant diamond wedding ring (at age 19) and a happily ever after!\\"<br /><br />This is an actual bit from the very end of the book (so... spoiler alert, I guess):<br /><br />I've read a couple of romance stories where I just really hoped the two main people didn't end up together. This was one of them. Just awful.
0062073486|4.0|This is the cover of the book I should of gotten. Ten little soldier not ten little Indians.  Excellent book but tough to follow in class
B00AFEY354|5.0|I teach a university multimedia writing and rhetoric course, and this was one of the movies that we analyzed for our course discussion on film and rhetoric. My students absolutely loved this movie, as did I!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The author is highly motivated by Goldratt and the flow of the book is very similar to Goldratt's  Goal. He takes the concepts of Goal and applies them in IT Operations. Only someone, liked the author,who has in depth knowledge of the matter can write such a book where the complex concept is described in a layman's language. The author has presented a new concept which will change the way IT operations is being handled. Loved the book and will reread it once more
