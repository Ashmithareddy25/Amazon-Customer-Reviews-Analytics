B0049P1VHS|5.0|Excellent Mini-Series. Great storyline, great actors and has a production value that surpases many of the ultra-big Hollywood movies.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I purchased this knife sharpener to sharpen my new Smith & Wesson knife and it is absolutely fantastic! My new knife is sharp as can be and so are all of my other cutlery items! I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a knife.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have played all of the angry bird games and this is by far the best! And please people... review the GAME not the region restrictions!
B0034G4P7G|4.0|Very interesting and informative.  I already saw it when it first came out and found it fascinating to learn how Facebook actually got started.  Very well acted.
B0012HA29O|5.0|There's the stupid debate on audio quality on a record or on a CD. The debate is as sterile as the knowledge of the recording and printing process everyone has on these recordings. I've heard music meant to be burned to CD as well as compressed to MP3s cut to records and it sounds as awful on record as it sounds on every other format and that's because of the process in question (Jamiroquai's Dynamite is the best example). If you like music like this record you should ALWAYS try to get a original copy of the original pressing. Why? Because of that process: The two track master tape was taken to the cutting stage where a very talented and savvy 'cutter' did the final adjustments to the playback of that master tape at the moment of fitting everything on a groove (cutting the record, literally). That process is called \\"the cut\\" and is that crucial process which gave the sound its character; its punch. If you get a \\"re-masterized\\" or just digitized version of the same material, the process was redone by another much less talented guy replacing the cutting process, or maybe it was skipped all along and the tape was just transferred to a DAT tape, then to an MP3 without the care and love of the guys that were hoping to have a hit on that unknown master tape back in the day. and THAT'S what makes an LP sound better than CD or MP3 (besides the compression and yada yada). The only way to keep the original character of a record is to digitize it to a CD and clean the crackle a bit, so don't ever hesitate on getting the original pressing of a record and enjoying it the way it should be. Then take that and burn a CD from there.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Saw it when it first came out in Theaters.  Even though I found it a bit confusing at times, I really enjoyed the concept.  It was refreshing to see an idea that was new.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is amazing. I've become an angry birds fan. Plus it was free! I love you are savings the birds in this version instead of rehashing the original.
B004L49K20|5.0|Not a dud on this great album.  Very listenable.  Buy it .  You wont be able to take it out of your cd player in the car.!!  These guys still got the magic touch.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Thanks so much to L Padgett for the installation help.  HTC Hero (rooted cm6).  This is a fantastic game, the graphics are super.  It is a nice change from just popping pigs.  The colors are beautiful and the music is nice, too.  I am looking forward to the coming levels. Thanks for making it free today!!<br /><br />I have downgraded my rating, simply because of all the problems with this app.  The problems only seem to be with Amazon, not the Angry birds from the official market.  Each time there is an update, I have to uninstall the game and then re install.  I am going to get rid of the angry birds apps from amazon and install the official market version. This problem occurs with Rio and Seasons, not sure about the original angry birds game.<br /><br />I have read of many people experiencing similar trouble, so it must have something to do with Amazon.  I don't have much trouble with other Amazon apps.
B004Q3UL2O|2.0|I was bored by the film, that I eventually gave up and switched the video off. Glad I rented it rather than saw it theatre.  No sparks between main characters (actors) and story line seems to drag.  Okay if you just want to see them naked.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|You'll love this game. Excellent addition to the Angry Birds collection. I love the new additions and the story. Looking forward to the movie. Great job again Rovio!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|First download on Amazon store.  this is cool!  25 word minimum review?  OK, I think I'll type some more.  Jeff Bezos rules!  Apple is doomed. History repeats itself. Let openness win.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this app is great and free. runs gre at on DX with no issues. on click isn't that hard to do if you shop on Amazon its probably already done so don't rate the app one star.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This turned out to be better than expected.  It was relational and fun.  Lots of violence (not gorey) since it is an action movie. However this movie doesnt depend on trashy dialog or sex scenes to interest the audience.  I recommend this movie and it is worth watching again.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game has a much improved look same great gameplay. Don't pay attention to one star reviews from people who can download not sure why they are faulting the game for that.
142311339X|5.0|There are many book that got me back into reading again but above all this entire series got me hooked. Now I can not wait for the 6th book. If you were to as me 5 years ago about reading a 6 book series I would have laughed and looked the other way. This book is a page turner for me. I love how the auther rights all of his books. LOVE THE SERIES!!!
B0042H6VYG|5.0|This two disc set is a Must Have for any PSB fan. You probably already have all the content on Disc 1, but Disc 2 is chock full of lots of television appearances and a full length concert! One note: this disc is a DVD encoded for Europe (PAL). If you don't have one already, you'll want to order a region-free player (you can get some great ones right here on Amazon).

B004J4WQ46|2.0|Sorry, couldn't resist. Corny, I know.    I wanted to love this record, because not only did I love The Strokes' first two albums, but I was one of the few fans who much enjoyed First Impressions. That Angles leaves me ambivalent might be even worse than if I hated it. Divisiveness is a hallmark of worthwhile \\"art\\". Never mind whether or not the Strokes are relevant; good songs are always relevant, no matter what kind of bells and whistles are trendy. Unfortunately, there are only three or four good numbers here and the rest is tepid, stitched-together filler.     What amazes me is that this record follows a five year hiatus. The band in no way sound refreshed. In fact, they sound hungover and depleted from a year-long world tour. The band itself in interviews claim that they can do better and that even they know this effort is a mixed bag. Well, why the hell release it then? Contractual obligation? Money? Certainly not out of passion. Bands have forged whole discographies in 5 years. Take a look at The Fall. Mark E. Smith is almost 54 years old, but the Strokes sound twice his age, weary and jaded before their time. There's always been an element of dispassion in The Strokes' work, but the actual *songs* never sounded that way.    The music? \\"Under Cover of Darkness,\\" \\"Gratisfaction,\\" and \\"Taken for a Fool\\" are stand outs. Nothing as good as any of the cuts from their first two records, but sturdy enough to seem like hooky out takes from that era. And I might be in the minority, but I also enjoyed the Car-sy muted chord progression and cheesy synths on \\"Two Kinds of Happiness\\"---that is, before the song erupts into an ill-fitting storm of drums and guitar.    The rest? There are glimmers here and there, but they seem to float out of the ether and disappear before blossoming into full-fledged songs.     I don't enjoy leaving negative reviews of bands whose prior work I admire and enjoy, but I think it would take a tremendous amount of charity to give this album anymore than 2.5 stars. The Strokes might very well release another record, if only to fulfill contractual obligations, but The Strokes, essentially, are no more. This is an odd-and-sods grab bag of ideas that the band members created independently, a Frankenstein record. It's clear that some of the members want to move on, and they should. I think they'll find much more inspiration when pursuing their separate ways, as Julian Cassablancas did with his much more impressive solo record.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|[[ASIN:B000NDI3SK The Ascent of Man (5 volume set)]]    It has been many decades since I first saw this series on PBS. (Documentary is too limiting a word.) My evaluation has not changed. I can only second review 128 by Jackie Chan. It is the best video series of its kind ever made, and it is not likely ever to be equaled. If you can not buy it, rent it, or borrow it, but find a way to watch it. With attention.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|I loved this movie. This movie is about a man sent to work on the moon by an energy company called Lunar to harvest Helium3 which is used in the future for energy. Sure, it has some flaws such as some plot issues but it was lovely overall and philosophically rich. Like the director, I also studied philosophy in graduate school and I pickup up all the references to the debates in personal identity and the ethical dilemmas associated with that complex issue. The movie also conveys the loneliness of the central character and his predicament skillfully and palpably. I really began to identify with his longing for his family on earth and the sadness that came with finding out that he will never have the life he remembers as being his own (see the movie to see what exactly I am talking about).     Rockwell did a good job of acting and the scenarios portrayed the isolation, loneliness, and helplessness his character finds himself due to the predicaments of being on the moon away from normal human contact. There are also quite funny moments (many involving the robot Gerty). There is a very original twist at the end on how the relationship between the main character and his robot companion turns out that is very different from what many might expect and how the relationship between man and machine for Hal 9000, Gerty's 2001: A Space Odyssey inspiration and the inspiration for dozens of other robot movie themes turned out. Much of the movie you will only see a few characters (including the Robot) but it never got boring for me as everyone seemed to have a different take and reaction on some shared experience. The ending was quite bitter sweet without being cliche and I think people will be moved by it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Says \\"Application not installed\\" every time. Too lazy to check the logcat.     Droid Incredible running Android 2.3.3 CM7
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this version has improvements in graphics but i like how they kept true to their adicting formula. i would recomend this game to anyone. ~ed
B004SBS8LA|5.0|After trying the original and then upgrading to \\"seasons,\\" I was expecting a minor upgrade. I was wrong. The entire interface has change, the game-play is easyer to control and the worlds have different objectives. Well worth the dollar.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|won't install on my Evo. neither will any of the angry birds games. really annoying. please fix soon, its not like I wouldn't pay for this game to work
B0000DETET|4.0|The songs are great! Dark, satanic,and makes you think of witches having an orgy at a bonfire. But the production is what will irritate a first time listener.  It sounds like someone recorded them behind a wall in a garage.  The drums sound like cardboard boxes, you can't make out the guitar notes, and some songs you need to read along the lyrics because you can't make out what he's saying. This album has been remastered poorly. There is also a re-recorded version of welcome to hell, bloodlust, and in nomine satanas on the Cast In Stone album expanded version.  You'll get your fix of high quality instumentals but Conrad Lants voice no longer sound like an evil irish gnome, but a typical heavy metal singer.  It's really give and take between the two albums. If you can get past the production, you may appreciate the group that inspired slayer, bathory, metallica, and so on.
0451197968|5.0|A very successful, but unlikey King novel.  Characters are developed quickly.  The pace is fast and furious.  Nothing is supernatural or overtly frightening, but, oh man, is this a sinister place set sometime in the future.         The Running Man is a nationally televised gameshow featuring ordinary US citizens, who through their own personal circumstances, volunteer to be chased by professionally trained headhunters with the goal that the citizen contestants will be executed for pure entertainment value.  It is possible to for a person to win by outmaneuvering the executioners, but in reality, nobody has ever survived for more than 8 days.     Despite knowing the odds and probable outcome, Ben Richards enters the game, with the hope that he might last long enough to earn enough game money to provide medical treatment for his daughter, gravely ill with pneumonia. Or perhaps from pollution created by the capitalistic, greedy country that has evolved.  However, Richards proves to be the ultimate player and his experience is cliffhanger.  I could not put this story down.    My secret favorite character is McCone, the premiere headhunter, who King describes at one point his snarling at Richards as \\"a completely unconscious gesture, one that could probably be traced all the way to McCone's ancestors, the Neanderthals who crept up behind their enemies with large rocks rather than battling to death in an honorable, but unintelligent manner.\\"
B004SBS8LA|1.0|All other versions of angry birds work fine on my phone.this one crashes before I play the first screen. Free is the right price as I would be ticked to have paid for it.

B00000JNO2|5.0|Fourth time is STILL a charmer! Some people say that Gimme Back My Bullets doesn't live up to the first three Skynyrd albums. I think it's unwise to say that. This album is just as great. The songs still pack a punch, and the music is still 100% addictive (and I mean that in a good way). The first song, \\"Gimme Back My Bullets,\\" is about returning to the top of the charts. Even if it mistakenly sounds like it's a song about gun control, it's still a fascinating song to listen to. \\"Every Mother's Son\\" sounds a bit generic, but it's still great. \\"Trust\\" and \\"I Got The Same Old Blues\\" give a continuous listening pleasure. Both \\"Double Trouble\\" and \\"Roll Gypsy Roll\\" are only at least three minutes long, but they are both equally satisfying, easily beating other 3-minute songs that are played on today's radio. \\"Searching\\" and \\"Cry for the Bad Man\\" are typical Skynyrd goodness. \\"All I Can Do is Write About It,\\" one of the softer songs on the album, is breathtakingly beautiful, a nice achievement in the world of Southern Rock. The final two songs (live versions of \\"Gimme Back my Bullets\\" and \\"Cry for the Bad Man\\") are worthwhile.<br /><br />Gimme Back My Bullets isn't exactly a perfect 10. But since I hardly see any flaws on this album, it's almost a 10. A 9.8 is good enough.<br /><br />Grade: 9.8/10<br /><br />Also from Lynyrd Skynyrd<br />Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd (9.8/10) [[ASIN:B00005RIKI Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd]]<br />Second Helping (9.8/10) [[ASIN:B000002P74 Second Helping (Reis)]]<br />Nuthin Fancy (9.9/10) [[ASIN:B00000JNO1 Nuthin Fancy]]
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excellent addition to the already great line up of angry birds. I will be wasting alot more time playing this game. Curse you angry birds and your addictiveness!
B000TGCR38|5.0|Extraordinary! It is simply wonderful to see a heroine in jaw-dropping movie like this. Small details do not go unnoticed. I was at the edge of my seat during the whole movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|A lot of time went into improving the visuals without losing the angry birds look and feel. Works better on my Captivate (running a custom ROM) than any other version.
159420229X|5.0|After stumbling on to the competitive memory circuit, the author embarks on an unlikely quest to become the memory champ in the next U.S. competition. This book chronicles his journey and provides a fascinating account about the history and science of memory along the way.<br /><br />I started reading this book knowing very little about the art of memory other than a basic definition of mnemonics. The author describes many of the techniques that he used to increase his memorization skills, including:<br /><br />Memory Palaces: Places you create in your mind to store visual memories<br /><br />The \\"Major System\\" for memorizing numbers phonetically<br /><br />POA Systems for memorizing numbers and/or cards: Person-Object-Action sequences for individual numbers (more interesting than it sounds)<br /><br />This information was brand new to me. As Foer is introduced to these techniques, you can feel his enthusiasm for learning new ways to use his brain. The art of memorization is all but lost in our current society of externalized data storage, but it does not have to be that way. The techniques that this memoir introduces will start you down the same path if you like; either way, it's a great read.<br /><br />In fact, once I started reading this book I could not put it down. The entire memoir is well written and keeps the reader's interest page after page. Though this is certainly not a how-to-book, it is a great starting point to learn more about memory principles.<br /><br />The author includes really interesting discussions about memory and creativity throughout. Though they may seem to be opposites at first glance, the author argues, compellingly, that they go hand-in-hand. My favorite chapters were:<br /><br />The Memory Palace: Details the history of this visual/spatial memory technique and point the reader in the right direction if they want to learn it.<br /><br />The End of Remembering: This chapter chronicles the reasons behind why we don't commit things to memory anymore. This account was very interesting, especially for the implications in scripture memory. I am guilty of reading widely at the cost of reading deeply.<br /><br />The Talented Tenth: This short chapter discusses some of the implications of memory and our school systems. Very interesting account of how memorization came to be disdained in the school system and the consequential effects.<br /><br />The Little Rain Man In All Of Us: Talks about the processing power of our brains and what savants can teach us. This chapter includes very interesting interviews with the man who inspired Rain Man and Daniel Tremmet, the subject of the documentary Brainman.<br /><br />The whole book is a really great read and is highly recommended. The only thing missing is a further recommended reading list. It will entertain you and possibly inspire you to practice the art of memory for yourself; it has inspired me to commit to memory many of the things that I have forgotten many times over.ications in scripture memory.

B004SCI9BS|4.0|The album itself is fun, catchy, energetic.    To the person who reviewed it and said it was only 96kbps...i'm not sure where you got that from. I just checked mine and it's 320kbps (got it from the amazon mp3 app for android). And it sounds fantastic.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I know it sucks to not be able to play rio but please only leave reviews for the app itself not the Amazon service.<br /><br />Great game!  I only wish there were more hours in the day!
B003ITZBW2|4.0|I usually have pretty mixed feelings about the DC animated flicks - 2 or 3 stars, most of them - but this one is a cut above the others I've seen. Very nice animation, good voicing by the leads, fun action, a pretty literate script, especially for this genre. In the grand scheme of things, I suppose the story does not hold big surprises if you're at all familiar with the twists and turns and identity crises which typify these kinds of stories; still, within the context of the genre itself, it keeps things interesting, and reveals the twists in entertaining fashion. Also, kudos for a really great final shot. When a flick like this can actually evoke a sense of pathos, you gotta give it due credit.     WARNING: this movie is not for little kids. Lots of blood and violence, and people die. It is rated PG 13 for a reason.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|just like my title says this version of angrybirds is the best by far. the sounds the art style is much better. this game also runs alot smoother on my phone as well. and for those rating it a low score because u cant get it, i dont think u should give it a bad score for that reason figire out whats wrong first and try to fix it. this appstore also wont work for people on at&amp;t, um sorry for you guys but this game os great!

1439107955|5.0|This novel is a good, easy read on the history of cancer. For most of human history, up until about the last decade, cancer researchers and doctors have been approaching this affliction wrong. Cancer is much more than a simple affliction. In fact, the term itself is likely to be outdated. Probably what best describes the term is that cancer contains a hierarchy of much more complex diseases so researchers and doctors alike must realize that every 'type' of cancer is unique, even within itself, with regards to further research and treatment. This novel also sheds light on the gruesome malpractice of approaching and treating cancer - as well as other medical conditions - before the 1980s. However, I do feel that within 5 years this book will be outdated since medical breakthroughs seem to be published every other week.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|great graphics and the game play is not bad. thanks for the free app.  25 word minimum? ?? what the heck do I need to type here to post a review. omg
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Runs fine on my Optimus (unlike Angry Birds Seasons).  Graphics are pumped up a bit and the refreshed back story is good even if it's a movie tie-in.
B0025KVLU6|1.0|Almost every song on this album is junk.  Here's the story as I remember it.  Beatles got a hold of some bad drugs and wanted to be nude on album or some such nonsense.  Not allowed.  Big babies made the cover white.  Whoptie do.  Now all the \\"fans\\" have to forever proclaim this album brilliant.  Abbey Road is brilliant.  This is not.  Sorry cry babies.  Hey Buffalo Bill - do you actually want to defend that?  Maybe a quarter of this is passable.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|finally ad free!!! and birds seem to fly way smoother! way worth the buy and the wait :) thank you for angry birds and Amazon
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just when you think your gonna download another anger birds game with more of the some what frustrating levels, they come out with this piece of genius. I have only played the first couple of levels but it seems like a whole new game with better graphics and some fun new birds to help escape imprisonment. From what i have seen so far I think its going to be another big hit.    Motorola Xoom
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Total con of a service. Let me play angry birds! Stupid extra word stupid extra word stupid extra word some more stupid extra words stupid localisation settings! Amazon got this allllll wrong.

0670022411|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!     I am always thrilled with a big, long book.  But, the story has some issues.    First, the love affair.  We needed a bit more  pain, unsureness, and anxiety with the two main characters.    Matthew from the beginning is her protector, soul mate, etc.  Not the stuff of love stories.      Mr. Darcy, but with no angst.    Second, too much filler......A little too much eating, sleeping and bathing with no purpose to the story.    Third, about 50 pages away from the end, I realize it is a sequel......    THE PLUS ..... I couldn't put it down and read it in a day.    So, I think that warrants three stars.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game...period.  although the monkies are freaking creepy its just wonderful.  great graphics and game play. could not have asked for a better product.  blah blah blah blabbity blah
0525423273|5.0|I adore this book. I read it after John Green of the vlogbrothers promoted it on YouTube. I didn't expect much, just something light to read between more serious novels. However, I loved this book. I read it three times within the first week of owning it. It is a sweet and believable romance, that left me inspired to  take another look at the book I hope to publish. Read this book, love this book. The story isbetterthan the title or the cover would suggest.
B0049U4INC|2.0|Disclaimer: This review is based on the Kindle sample. But that was enough to make me think I don't want to pay for the book.<br /><br />Every page I read screammed \\"APPLE!\\" and \\"MACINTOSH\\" at me. The MACINTOSH is amazing and innovatve. The sidebars are from people who work at APPLE. If the entire book is that Apple-centric, I'm not very interested. I've read books like this from people who share their wisdom based on their experience with one company. Although there are probably some useful things that type of book I've found that kind of perspective to be very limited.<br /><br />What's great at Apple might not be so great at other places. Or for me. And this book isn't for me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rovio has done it again; Absolutely wonderful game.  I loved the first Angry Birds when it was released back in 2009.  When AB: Seasons released, I was so eager to get that version and now the same with AB: Rio.  Very nice change in pace from having pigs in the first two, but it is again just a great as the first two and it was free!  It is a shame that Amazon went this route and is denying this great addition to the Angry Birds family to everyone worldwide.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|While Season's provides great graphics at each colorful holiday, this is the first update that strays from the core store of birds versus pigs. Now you get to rescue colorful birds!    The new graphics and story are a lot of fun. Game mechanics are, of course, the same -- a fling-the-bird puzzle game.     Works great on all of my Android devices, include Galaxy tab, Nexus S, and Motorola Xoom -- all in full resolution graphics.    Glad it's available free on the first day, too. :)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|what's the purpose of creating an appstore if its limited crap. rovio releasing this on a limited market another bull. us only crap whats next
B004SBS8LA|5.0|much better than original.  No adds.  works great.  graphics are very good. change of pace freeing birds changes if up.  could use some harder levels.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio installed and runs great on my stock Evo. I notice no lag and the graphics seem more polished. Good fun game to have.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This app dots everything you ask for. Ready to search, quick to purchase, fast to download. It  stores the music right to your phone. I use this app daily.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This delightful movie is one of my favorite movies and I am 56 years old.  I love the precocious children and their naughty antics.  Colin Firth is wonderful as the overwhelmed father, as a widow.  The beautiful Emma Thompson is charming in this role and I so enjoy her transformation.  Angela Landsbury has always been one of my favorite actors and she is hilarious as the snooty, near-sighted,wealthy aunt.  Why this movie was not in theaters first(?) and went right to TV is a curiosity to me.  I loved it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun new version of a great game. I am excited about the idea of a competing app store. Is there a way to write reviews without comments? Not sure.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|MILD SPOILER ALERT:<br />Well, I've seen this - the original version of the film - and the U.S. version called [[ASIN:B003EYVXUU Let Me In [Blu-ray]]] and I liked the U.S. version better in almost all cases.  I thought the casting for the U.S. film was superb.  I liked Eli (although not as much as Abby) in the Swedish version but Oskar, with his nose running all the time, I could not stand.<br /><br />I thought Eli's eyes were great.  I liked the scene with the crane taking the body ice cube out of the frozen lake.  I liked the acid burns better.  But, all in all, I much preferred the U.S. version.<br /><br />Both versions (and this one gets the major kudos since it was the original) are unique, very frightening, have well-done cinematography and did I say they were scary?
0698116496|5.0|We got this book as a birthday present for my little one. She loves it because every time we can tell the story different. Also on every page there is a red balloon and she loves trying to spot it. We have so much fun with this book and I am so glad it was given to us.
B004L3AQFG|5.0|Distinguished, insightful directing by Danny Boyle, fabulous cinematography (so glad I got this on blu-ray), blow-your-mind acting by James Franco.<br /><br />I can still remember when I first heard the amazing story of Aron Ralston's survival in the Utah Canyonlands back in 2003.  I know the Canyonlands and it was unbelievable to me that he survived, much less when I heard about the courage and determination he used to survive.<br /><br />Franco is compelling in basically this one-man movie about Ralston's struggle and fortitude to survive.  This movie, just like the true-life story, is inspiring and motivating.  I want to know more so I just ordered Ralston's book about his ordeal [[ASIN:074349282X Between a Rock and a Hard Place]].
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've played the first Angry Birds completely, and the Holiday version. With feeling nearly worn out from the series, I unknowing needed something fresh. And that freshness arrived this morning with RIO!<br /><br />RIO is more than just a polished reiteration of the original. The streamlined simple user interface gets you playing in no time. The rebuild of the levels is very interesting, by adding elements to the foredeound they have added a sense of depth, delivering more perspective to the experience.<br /><br />Though I've only played about twelve levels, I have experienced no issues. Let this be an example to developers on building apps. This is a very fine game. I highly recommend!
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Yowzah! Beware of who you invite into your home - you never know what kind of monster may be standing on the threshold.<br /><br />Chilling vampire tale starring children although the bullies are almost scarier than the vampire. SUPERB casting in all the roles.<br /><br />I've seen the original Swedish version, too [[ASIN:B001MYIXAW Let the Right One In [Blu-ray]]] and I actually liked the U.S. version much better.  I liked the actors in the U.S. version much more.  I do have to say that in most ways the U.S. version stayed very true to the Swedish version.<br /><br />This was probably the scariest and most realistic vampire film I've seen to date.  And the most original.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|A new angry birds that we all love w/o the pigs. Great graphics and just as fun. Instead of golden eggs to look for you are looking for golden fruit. Love angry birds.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Cannot install at all, with unclear error message. Amazom appstore is the worst launch ever!  The one star is for amazon, very disappointing.  I'm sure the game must be fun though.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Anyone else have a problem exiting the game?  I am using the HTC Thunderbolt.  I sent a email to Rovio asking about the issue.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Great sound, great volume control. I kept debaiting which headset to go with. Glad I went with Turtle Beach.  They take the game to another level. (Black Opps)
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Easy  to download and install. And to top it  all off, it was FREE. Very cute graphics. Fun to play. Nice addition to the Angry Birds family.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Vaguely spoilerish<br /><br />Ignore the one star reviews from those who wanted the fairy tale ending for Katniss.  This book ends realistically with our heroine confronted with the aftermath of the unthinkable hell that is war.  I would have been disappointed if she had gone off into the sunset like some hero.  The devastation and trauma brought on by war is never forgotten by those who actually live through it.  To end the series with a happy ending would have been trite and blatantly disrespectful, not just to the characters but to anyone who has been confronted with war.  If you find yourself hating the end, then you missed the point of the entire series (and desperately need to examine what millions of people have to go through everyday of their lives, it may not be televised but the hunger games are very real for some).
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Lost 10 mins installing the app and configuring 1-click only to find that (1) it doesn't give you the free app and (2) it doesn't work at all in the UK.    Extremely disappointed, and feel misled by amazon.
B0002EXH4K|4.0|First off I'll admit I'm no Megadeth expert. I've only owned three albums. I know a handful of random singles. This is the only album I ever kept. It's the catchiest and best of what I've heard. I'm sure many fans disagree about which is the best album. I think this is no doubt their most popular album, and there's usually a reason for that. Dare I call it Megadeth's \\"black album\\". It's front-to-back kick ass. Most every songs is heavy heaven, but the title track alone is classic enough to own this. It's cheap used. Any metalhead should have gotten this many years ago.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Has anyone else figured out how to install on Droid x? I've successfully downloaded it 3 times and can't install. Won't allow me to do it with SD card unmounted.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|I didn't get this until years after it was released, but I love it now. Tracklist-wise it's basically the best of the first two albums, plus a few non-album cuts including the fan fave \\"Moses\\". I've never seen Coldplay so this is nice to have. I'd imagine it would be even better to own having seen them. The big plus here is the DVD. In fact one might say this is a live DVD with bonus cd included. Either way the DVD is 5 songs longer than the cd and it's a great show. This is all the better when this can be now had for just a few bucks used. Even as a casual fan, I think this collection is a must.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The application asks me to set up an account and a payment method, only then to tell me that this application is not available in my region. I feel that it's very poorly designed.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Installed with no trouble on my Evo 4g. The game runs silky smooth and is a blast to play so far! I'm very pleased with what I've seen of the Amazon appstore thus far.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have to say these are probably the best headphones I have ever owned, this is my second pair in 12 years, the only reason I am buying a new pair is because the other pair finally got broken by my nephew as he sat on them. I am very happy with my purchase as these are almost audiophile quality and they are quite durable (beaten up, dropped countless times, used as my primary DJ headphones, and other various hazards). The sound reproduction of these headphones is just as exact as my buddies Denon AH-D500's, but he just will not admit he spent to much on a set of phones!! The highs are very crisp, the mids are super smooth, the lows are amazing for the size they are! I would recommend these to anyone who needs a great set of phones for a great price...<br /><br />For a great addition to these phones, try these replacement pads.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Beyerdynamic+DT250%2FDT280+Replacement+Earpads+%28Velour+Earpads+%28pr%29%29&x=12&y=21
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Useless appstore for anyone outside the US, pathetic amazon, really pathetic. Will not be using it in the future even if you decide to include the UK......
B00003CXB4|5.0|I was so excited wen i finally got this in the mail...like literally. i felt like a kid again wacthing it and singing a long to it...my all time favorite disney movie...this movie is a classic
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Come on!!!!!!!!!!!!  Been waiting and waiting for this game.  It finally launches and the darn thing won't install on my phone.  Droid Incredible.  This better be fixed while it's still free.  Think maybe you should have tested this out first???????
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I think Rovio did a great job with this, it's still the same game play, fun and simple, but with great new levels and graphics
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I am very disappointed in both Rovio and Amazon. When I first heard that Angry Birds Rio was launching exclusively on the Amazon Appstore for Android, I was mostly indifferent. Actually I think my original thoughts were \\"That's stupid, why can't they just release it on the Android Market. Oh well, I'll download the Amazon Appstore, install Angry Birds Rio, and then uninstall this utterly pointless venture of Amazon's.\\"    I was also somewhat indifferent when Rovio initially distributed the original Angry Birds for Android through a 3rd-party download site. I had about the same thought's as I did about downloading AB: Rio from Amazon.    But the original Angry Birds release on that 3rd-party site turned out to be a frustrating waste of time, and I had to jump through many hoops, as well as deal with countless download timeouts and errors because the site was unprepared for such the onslaught of the entire Android Army, foaming at the mouth to get Angry Birds on their devices. Since it was released to the market, it has been a much more pleasant experience downloading/updating Angry Birds and the subsequent Angry Birds Seasons. Albeit, I still have to unmount my SD card to install Angry Birds or any updates. (ROVIO PLEASE FIX THIS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD).    The Android Market is the original and universal place for app distribution. It just works. Why mess with something that works? I'm calling out Rovio for making the poor decision to launch this title exclusively on the Amazon Appstore for Android. It is simply put, a poor business decision. I don't care if Amazon is padding your pockets for the right to sell this title exclusively for a period of time. The fact that you have isolated billions outside of the US (which is not me) and millions of AT&T customers (which is STILL not me), is just an absolutely terrible idea from a business standpoint.    The Amazon Appstore for Andriod so far in my mind, and the minds of half of the people that have reviewed Angry Birds Rio, is a total and utter failure. The fact that you HAVE to use an SD card to download an application through the Amazon Appstore means that those of us with devices that normally require us to unmount the SD card to install Angry Birds titles, now are completely unable to install the application, even if we can download it. It also alienates those users that are actually able to download the title, but who don't have an SD card, or who don't want or can't afford one. So not only is the door closed to those outside of the US, but also to those in the US either with AT&T, without SD cards, or with devices that have issues with the SD card installations. AMAZON. DO YOU SEE YOUR TARGET MARKET GETTING SMALLER AND SMALLER??? I DO. Also, the download speed is absolutely unforgivable. I never see downloads of comparable size take as long as it took to download Angry Birds Rio, even over 3G.    Amazon, you should be ashamed of yourselves. You have really fallen short of the mark. You set the bar pretty high with your other product and service offerings. Now, you can't even reach the bar you placed. You have your work cut out for you if you want this to be a successful venture. Personally, I think you should stick to selling physical products. Leave the App sales to those that do it much better than you already.    Rovio, fix the SD card issue. It's been long enough.    In case anyone from Amazon or Rovio ACTUALLY reads this, takes it to heart, and wants to fix the issue, I am using a Verizon Wireless Droid Incredible. I have a 2GB SD Card mounted in my device. My download completes successfully, but the installation will not, due to the aforementioned SD card issues.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I was happy to download the new app store and angry birds rio but unable to install the game. :( Any suggestions or tips would be appreciated.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|BEST MOBILE BIBLE APP FOR ANDROID AND iOS!!!! With the bookmark option (so you can 'save' passages for reference) and the share feature (share what you're reading on FaceBook, Twitter, Tumblr etc.) the Holy Bible is an awesome bible reference app.  Once you sign up, you can sync your mobile app with YouVersion.com for desktop bible reading.  The plans (there are hundreds) help you to get more familiar with the Word and the more you understand about what the Lord has said about your life, the more peace you will find.  Download and you won't be sorry.
0756404738|5.0|This book is amazing.  It seems that most of the time book sequels start to sour and become a bit more dull, but this book is actually better than the first.  The Kingkiller Chronicles are definitely my favorite (and most anticipated!) series to date.
B004BBDHEK|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Yanni and lived with his mesmerising melodies for years. This album is a mediocre New Age album that doesn't remind us of Yanni at all. A few songs still have bits of his true spirit, but most of them are quite ordinary tunes that are being heard on instrumental radio channels all the time. For people know Yanni by \\"Nostalgia\\", \\"One Man's Dream\\", \\"Until the Last Moment\\", \\"Deliverance\\", \\"Renegade\\", \\"Standing in Motion\\", \\"Santorini\\", \\"Keys to Imagination\\", etc, this album is not even close.<br />At least I'm happy to see the instrumental side of Yanni is back (\\"Voices\\" was awful IMO), but I'm still expecting magic from Yanni. Who knows? The live tour might change everything, but at this time the studio version is just average for me.<br /><br />Maybe it's time for Linda Evans to be back in Yanni's life again!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I had no problems with the download or the install, so I have no idea what the other people are talking about att not allowing to download and install. This version of Angry Birds is just another great addition to the line up and it was free to download today! Great choice to open with Amazon!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great update to an ever expansive series.<br /><br />Please don't rate 1 star if you are on AT&T and have side loading blocked.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Stock Droid 2, Verizon, US -- Downloaded fine, then \\"Application not Installed!\\"  Frustrating as a first try with Appstore.
B004J4WQ46|3.0|The Strokes are that best kept secret of a band. They're not out to make a statement, they just produce music that's full of compressed vocals, tinkly drums, and pumping guitar. Unfortunately, they have been out of the spotlight for quite some time and this new offering after the hiatus doesn't add up.<br /><br />It took me a while to get into their first single, \\"Under Cover of Darkness,\\" a jaunty tune in which lead singer Julian Casablancas shows off his range of vocals. Something about it didn't ring true to the Stokes sound. After listening to it a few more times, it's now become a decent song to my ears. On this album, \\"Taken For a Fool\\" and \\"Life is Simple in the Moonlight\\" feel like classic Strokes and are easy to get in to. However, flashy ballads like \\"You're So Right,\\" which boast synthesizers, feel like they don't belong, much less pegged with the Strokes name.  All that time taken off to create something like this?<br /><br />If you've heard Casablancas' solo effort, [[ASIN:B002IUBH3O PHRAZES FOR THE YOUNG]], you'll find yourself comparing that album to this one. ANGLES is not a very memorable collection of songs, more of a half-hearted interpretation of their original sound. I'm still a Strokes fan, just slightly disappointed with this piece.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Unlike many of the folks griping about amazon app store issues, i actually played the game and it is top notch, simple and a lot of fun!
B004J4WQ46|4.0|It's been 5 years sine The Strokes last release third album \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" which was met by a mixed reaction from fans and critics alike, despite the fact that it featured some of The Strokes best songs many people were writing The Strokes off. They toured the album in 2006 and after the tour decided to take some time out from each other, as well as work on their own projects. Lead singer Julian released \\"Phrazes For The Young\\" in 2009 and guitarist Albert Hammond jr released 2 fine solo albums. In 2010 The Strokes played a few festival dates and announced that an album would follow in 2011. Even though you had to wonder about it as the rumblings were that it was their toughest to album to record with Julian missing for parts of the recording. Guitarist Nick Valensi even said recntly that he would never record another album this way again. There was even problems with producer Joe Chicarelli so much so Albert Hammond Jr took over production duties. So all this should mean that The Strokes would continue on their downward slope! Well wrong because with \\"Angles\\" The Strokes have deliverded a great record.     From the moment first single \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" was released for free in Feburary the signs were good, the dual assult of guitarists Hammnd and Valensi sounds great on the track as Julian delivers his trademark vocals, the free release that caused the website to crash for a while due to demand showed there is still a loyal fan base. \\"You're So Right\\" which starts out not to unlike \\"Hard To Explain\\" until Julian comes in with his vocals repeating \\"Tell Me What Happened\\" a few times which is what he does with a few of the lines in this song, there's also a Queens Of The Stone Age like solo and it also features some of Fab Moretti's best drumming it sounds like he's turned into a human drumming machine!. Album opener \\"Machu Picchu\\" is a great opener and has a bit of reggae feel about it and an eighties style vocal. For people who complain The Strokes don't experiment they should give the track \\"Games\\" a listen as it comes off as a dance track! with a killer sounding bass, yet you still know it's The Strokes.     \\"Call Me Back\\" features just casablancas on vocals and valensi on guitar the highlight coming at 1:18 into the song as Casablacas sings \\"Tell Me, don't Tell Me\\" over Valensi as he changes the style of guitar playing.\\"Gratisfaction\\" is just pure Strokes and features a harder rocking edge compared to the rest of the album, it's so good to hear two guitarists playing off each other rather than playing the same riff. The album finishes with \\"Life Is Simple in the moonlight\\" which has their sound stamped all over it and has a great chorus and is also the only song produced by Joe Chiccarelli.     Where as \\"First Impressions Of Earth\\" was close to one hour in lenght and had 14 tracks, \\"Angles\\" clocks in at just under 35 minutes and 10 tracks much like their first two albums(is this it, room on fire) and is the better for it as every song will be familar to you and never outstays it's welcome.     It might have been a rough proccess to write and record and there might have been some in fighting, Lead Singer Casablancas even joked recently that he was jealous that Jack White was now going solo. The one thing that has not sufferded is the music as The Strokes sound as vital now than when they first burst onto the scene ten years ago, lets hope we don't have to wait another 5 years for an album as \\"Angles\\" is a great album!

B004SBS8LA|1.0|Like many others - went through the process of download of unwanted Amazon app blah blah blah to be finally told its not available in my region. This check could have been made up front and saved everybody outside the US of A the bother.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Installed no problem on Evo and the framerates are excellent. LOVE having no ads. Really thinking of purchasing the other Angry Birds as the ads drive me CRAZY! If you're on AT&T the problem is with your PROVIDER, not with Amazon or Rovio. Time to get a real phone (as in a non crippled Android) and provider.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|But I cannot. I have a droid x and this program does download but then won't install. Other programs off of the amazon appstore won't install either. Never had trouble with the Google marketplace. What a shame.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Application cannot install is the error I get when trying to install on a stock droid x after following the directions. I'll stick with the Android market, sorry Amazon!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Thank you Amazon for not letting international customers download a *free* app! I hope some day you are subjected to the same humiliation. At least the real Android Market's country check can be circumvented... That's what we get for installing your ripoff.  Back to the real Market...
B003RS5JJY|5.0|I was so about the give up on Dexter, but this season turned around and this episode made me wanting more!  WOW is all I can say - can't wait for next season!  Darn Netflix put this one episode on one disc (I guess not Netflix...more like Showtime, but whatever!), and because I was too impatient to wait one whole day for it to come in the mail, I got it on Amazon.  Thanks Amazon!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|What a great price for the game \\"free\\" and with no ads. Thank you amazon. Can wait to see for great games and apps.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Really nice upgrade over the original game. Great music and lots of new features and variety.  Those complaining that it's US-only don't understand that the Amazon Appstore itself is US-only right now.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|You need a credit card to download it :( thats a pitty cause not everyone have one, so i :( but angry birds is cool...hope i can get this version on other markets

0756404738|3.0|The first book in this series was absolutely one of the very best stories I have ever read.  This book is mediocre at best.  It is positively boring in a lot of parts.<br /><br />The author doesn't just narrate about the tedium Kvothe goes through in parts, he takes us right along.  No kidding.  Page after page, after page of just nothing.  Describing in great detail how bored Kvothe is, what he isn't doing etc. What he wishes he could do, etc. It really is irritating.<br /><br />I do keep reading waiting for something interesting to happen, but it just never does.  No action, no excitement, no interesting concepts like \\"heart of stone\\"<br /><br />There is a section where he dulls with  other class mates, but there is no description, it is just stated.<br /><br />A point to the author,  Once you indicate how great a character is, you can't just go back to him being thick, and ordinary like the other students.<br /><br />In the first book, There are adventures after adventure.  In the end of the book, you start to see just how clever Kvothe really is.  When he is sitting in that old courtyard, he actually starts to see a pattern in the leaves.  It gives you a hint of how bright he is.  In this book, there is none of that, and instead Kvothe comes off, and it is indicated, that he is being rather thick headed. At one point(so as to not spoil anything, I won't describe the scene) professor Loden is asking him if he sees the wind, and he is all \\"uh, nope\\"  That's exciting!<br /><br />Some one else advances faster than him in his class on naming.  That is not what we want to read.  We don't want to read about 'Mr Ordinary', that is BORING.  We want to read about super clever Kvothe.<br /><br />A clever person does not slide back to mediocrity.  In the end of the first book, Kvothe does great things, although sometimes unintentionally on his part, it happens often, and you get the sense that there is this underlying greatness to Kvothe.<br /><br />In this book, it is just boredom for Kvothe, Kvothe making stupid decisions, and Kvothe not being clever.<br /><br />Denna's here, Denna's gone.. Who cares?  Not this guy!  This book could be about 1/4 less pages than it is at least.<br /><br />I couldn't put the first book down, this one I have to struggle through, Geesh....<br /><br />I anxiously awaited this book for a long time, and really, it is killing my interest in this story altogether!<br /><br />It is like Patrick set out to make a trilogy, and then decided he would make more money if it was in 8 parts.  Time just drags on in this book.<br /><br />By the second book, Kvothe's clever mind, should have figured out a lot of ways to do things for him, and he should be not struggling to live like in the first book.  He is street smart, clever, and extremely talented.<br /><br />It is just really boring, and irritating.e not being clever.    Denna's here, Denna's gone.. Who cares?  Not this guy!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|A very nice app, fun to play and a spectacular coup for Amazon. This review I suppose is as much about the new app store as the game, I love good competition and this launch will only make android stronger.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio takes everything that was great about the original and makes it better. Better level design, better physics engine, better graphics, better menu layout. Its very simmilar to the original so I would reccomend anyone intrested in playing Angry Birds to skip the original, skip the seasons expansion pack, and go straight to Rio.
1569242739|4.0|I bought this book for my daughter (who is my vegan baker in the home)and the cupcakes were very good! I especially like the green tea cupcakes, which was at first a bit unusual, but they tasted amazing! The pictures in the book are also beautiful! Next up: Vegan Cookies Take Over the World\\"! Can't wait!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|so freaking addictive .. i got kicked out of class for playing it lol.. graphics are amazing. no more pigs oinking. i love the whole franchise, i even bought the yellow bird plushie for my desk.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|doesnt install on Droid 2. i do have my settings set correctly and since i work at a VZW call center i have training and this IS an AMAZON issue, not a user error.
B0011DK5AU|5.0|not bad the cover shows signs of wear but after 30 years ?? it looks great although i miss the whirly thing that goes with it but am not willing to shell out 200+ bucks not bad nice deal would recommend and fast shipping too.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works fine on Nexus One on T-Mobile. Sorry AT&T users, it is really lame that they block downloads. They will probably find a way around it. As for the region restriction, it would be nice if it wasn't there, but this is hardly the first item that has ever been region restricted or have different release dates in different markets. It doesn't justify all the 1 star reviews.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Yeah that little step by step video they give you, total crap, not as easy as they claim, quite frankly its very inconvenient, which makes me never want to use amazons app store again. Thus I never downloaded the game.
B004IJZFP4|5.0|5 stars, while I do agree that it ain't the 1970's Teaser, which I have been listening to for going on over 30 years, this new album is refreshing to say the least..  Play them back to back & enjoy that's the way to go.  Any Tommy Bolin is 5 stars.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|1) It's only available in the US and in lands that the US deem part of their territory.<br />2) It's a pain in the arse to get.  There are so many steps, including setting up your 1-step address/payments, etc.<br />3) You need to have the Amazon app installed AND logged in at all times, to use this game.  So lame.  Who knows what kind of information they are taking from you.  If you uninstall the Amazon app, it won't let you run the game.<br /><br />I'm going to try it for a few days and get rid of it.  This is not worth me losing sleep over.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|So far the game is fun.  Updated interface with some nice graphics and music.  You still have the traditional birds which is fun.  So far have not ran into any pigs yet...which is odd.    I downloaded and installed the amazon appstore and Rio with no issues on Evo 4G.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works as specified.  Angry Birds Rio has a new arcade-like polish on it that I really enjoy seeing.  New game objectives should make it interesting also.    I'm on an awesome T-Mobile G2.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I am a huge angry birds fan. This one looks great, but not nearly challenging enough. The monkeys are a funny and new touch. The interface is much better and more appealing.
0895260131|1.0|It's no wonder Academics don't take this guy seriously. On the first 30 pages alone, my World civ professor here at Harvard found 15 mistakes. It seems Mr.Spencer is simply trying his best to give a distorted view of the Koran and history in an attempt to spread his Islamophobic views and garner support. His books are mainly read by evangelicals trying to incite more hatred toward islam. Reading this book was the biggest waste of my life, I wish I could have that time back.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|First, pretty annoying that people are giving the APPLICATION one star because of an Amazon region restriction. Lets rate the quality of the app, not anything else, ok? If you can't use the app, don't rate it. I'm sure you'll get the chance eventually.<br /><br />Awesome graphics, control, and sound as always from these guys. I've always enjoyed the Angry Birds games and they continue to innovate and do great work.
B004P9FAL6|1.0|No Extended Cuts, no Sale. By the way, to all sycophants, WB (on their own commercial, no less) advertised every one of these \\"Ultimate Editions\\" will have  their own special extended cut, end of sentence.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Since I downloaded this app, I have been able to access devotionals and the Bible itself more conveniently with my smart phone. I love how I can integrate it smoothly when I am at a PC as well. So, I use it both on my phone and online while at work. I absolutely love it!!
B004DMAZQK|4.0|I was a big fan of their debut album, and the follow-up delivers more of the same. While perhaps a little uneven, there is enough there to make it worthwhile. They definitely have a 80's post-punk, new wave sensibility. The Joy Division, Tears For Fears, Julian Cope and The Church influences are prevalent throughout.I think they do protest too much about the Joy Division and Julian Cope influences, they're obvious. My favorite tracks were \\"Bad Love\\", \\"Strangers\\", and \\"Bigger Than Us\\". I found \\"Turn the Bells\\" and \\"Is Love\\" to be rather bland bookends that weighed the album down a bit. A promising sophomore album, hopefully the best is yet to come.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazon takes all my private info and only after refuses to process my order because of geography.  lame. lame lame lame lame 25 lame lame lame
B004RL9T50|4.0|I rented this movie expecting to hate it. It did have some over dramatic and slow parts but I was presently surprised to find this movie had really funny moments. The voice acting/animated cast of this movie and the reversal of the traditional good guy, bad guy role make the movie very worthwhile. My youngest, 3 and 6, were belly laughing and asking for the movie to play again and again. The music from Highway to Hell to \\"BAD\\" had everyone dancing around the room. If you are looking for a kid's movie that parents won't groan through this is a GREAT rental.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Yet again people outside the US lose out.  I can download the store, sign in and everything but I'm not allowed to download.  Thanks a lot Amazon. NOT!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|same angry birds game play though the object is to release birds instead of kill pigs. highly reccomended for any angry birds fan!  it runs smoothly and is fun to play while being more different than the original than seasons is.
B000X12QQ2|5.0|...what was labled as Mono turned out to be Stereo, and vice versa. The manufacturer was either lazy or deaf. anyway, thank goodness for the Stereo mixes (on Disc 1) and the bonus tracks.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Graphics are much improved, new calipso music too. Haven't found any glitches so far!  Like the flying birds instead of pigs...but they're hard to see clearly. Droid X
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazon sent me an email inviting me to use new app store with free AB Rio, signed in etc etc downloaded app but only found out it didn't work in the UK when I tried to run it. Saw lots of apps until then, now none.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun game. Sad that its only available in the USA. I think the 25 word limit is a bit too steep. However, there should be less short unhelpful reviews.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great.fun.works on droid two. Good game play and I still refer all the people I know to get this app.... ... ...you did a good job.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love everything about it! Was well worth the wait! Can't wait to keep playing it! Droid on Verizon working perfectly! Oh and by the way thanks amazon for offering it for free!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I click on Get App and the purchase fails  informing me to turn on 1-click. Even after activating 1-click I get the same error. Not happy.
B0010X745K|4.0|While this movie has a much maligned ending (which I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't viewed this yet...) ,what people don't seem to understand is that movies based on books must make certain concessions and even outright retooling to make them either viable or interesting to a larger audience who buy or sit through a film based solely (for the most part at least) on previews or word of mouth. Being a HUGE Stephen King fan and Constant Reader I can empathize with fellow fan's bewildered or even apoplectic reaction to changes made to their favorite book or novella once it finally gets to the big or small screen, hell even Steve himself has thrown a King-sized (i'm sorry...) hissy fit about the treatment of \\"The Shining\\" by Kubrick, which, if you know the reason, is understandable as well as a little relatable. Anyway, the point is that it is moronic to overlook a good piece of cinema just because \\"Hey,Norton isn't supposed to be BLACK!!!\\" or \\"Hey, Ollie Weeks doesn't wear GLASSES!!!\\", like I said...certain concessions. Yes, if you have read the short story the ending and alot of the ancillary characters are different, lines are redistributed, events are shuffled subtly, but the bones of the story remain and make for a good watch. As stated before, yes the ending is different, RADICALLY DIFFERENT, but as pole-axed as I was upon my first viewing, I ultimately realized that in some ways it was really no less valid when viewed as an adaptation and retelling, and much better suited to the medium and the wider audience than the original. My point is, from Stephen King geek to others out there that might have been turned off by friends or reviewers, pick this movie up and accept it for what it is and not what it was SUPPOSED TO BE. If you're like me then at least it's one to cross off the list and take it's place on the shelf between \\"The Langoliers\\" and \\"The Night Flier\\".
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is an improvement over the original.  The new appstore is nice too.    The 25 word min for these reviews well be one of the first things amazon changes.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Hello,    I opted for an upgrade last month for my gaming headset and I heard some good things about sound quality regarding this product. The price is expensive yet acceptable if you truly wanted to treat yourself to a great gaming experience. What really sold me on these is that they were wireless and 7.1.    When I got the headset, I immediately installed it and started to test it out with its multitude of options. The sound is INCREDIBLE and if this was ALL you need, this was a great buy.    However, this headset is also a microphone and that is where the deal breaker starts.    The microphone has NO mic cancellation!    I wasted 2 hours wondering why I could hear my mouse clicks and who I could hear my fiancee coughing in the other room through my headset. This thing picked EVERYTHING UP!    I went to their website and found a 15 page long page regarding this issue and watching it unfold over the months.    Logitech knows about the problems of this headset and it's been ongoing for 6 months!    (check google for g930 noise cancellation problem)    Their claim? Will be fixed the next patch but have no ETA and they have no replied to the thread since the new year.    How can in this day and age can you not have a functional microphone?    For this price? Unacceptable.    Returned and refunded.    Buyer beware!!!    Jason
B004SBS8LA|1.0|we want it in the UK, sort it out rovio. Why limit it to iPhone and US users? and amazon why let me review on the us appstore app and not download? stupid!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|great app for analyzing and helping troubleshoot slow wireless networks. it will show you the best channel for your router, as well as all those in range.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I would have had to pay a dollar just to get this thing if I wasn't a woot crawler.  Anyway, awesome app, well worth the dollar if you have to shell it out, and obviously doesn't work outside the United States, so don't bother if you aren't in the US.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|beautiful graphics. smooth transitions and fun game play. best of the angry birds. people having problems, make sure your phone is capable. sweet game. thanks amazon
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Finally, ad-free Angry Birds. Seems to run much better without all the ads, plus I can finally see the whole level. HTC Incredible.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I feel that this is a great addition to the Angry Birds family. The gameplay is great and the Rio theme is something new that i think everyone would like.
B000GALEWW|4.0|This is a good CD, but it is far from being the best Metallica's album!!! But this is a beautiful album version!!!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I have seen lots of movies from this list [[ASIN:0312326114 The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made, Updated & Revised (Film Critics of the New York Times)]] but in my opinion Seven Samurai is the best. It's a very intelligent, thoughtful and uplifting movie, a true masterpiece.
1400052181|4.0|I'm not any type of science person, so I'm not terribly familiar with the HeLa cells, so this book served as my basic introduction of HeLa cells. It was quite interesting to learn of all the contributions that HeLa have made to science, but that's not the true point of the story.     The story's focus is about the people, especially the Lacks family and the many trials and tribulations they went through since the HeLa cells existence. However, it is also a study in the evolution of protection about human subject research. It is interesting to see how the author formed a relationship with the Lacks family, gained their trust, and told a story no one ever bothered to tell.    What bothered me a bit was the organization of the book. It jumps from place to place, from time to time. One chapter would be set in the 1960s and the next chapter would be in 2001 or something. It was really disorienting, and really confused the events and their timing. She would discuss one event that happened and then we would hear about it again as the author learned about it in real life. Just disconcerting.    But an interesting and informative read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The name says it all. It is a great source for at least 20 different English and many other language versions of the bible. Many reading plans, and social integration with Twitter and Facebook. This is a definite addition to anyone's application drawer.
B00000I41J|5.0|Awesome classic jazz cd.  You'll enjoy the ensemble with standouts like Miles Davis that accompany Cannonball Adderley on this masterpiece.  A great buy!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love angry birds &amp; ab seasons. loving this game too. the graphics are awesome. would have paid .99 for this. thank you amazon for the free game on launch day.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|awesome game so far so good. highly recommend for everyone. wow this 25 word minimum is stupid i dont know what else to type. lol
0439023521|5.0|Heart grabbing characters and a terrific plot. Futuristic scenario and violent nature are offset by heartwarming development of plot and characters. In comparison to other 1st books to be followed by sequels, I would rate it comparable to book 1 of Harry Potter. It is an easier read than other great multi-novels like Wheel of Time and Lord of the Rings.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love it! much better story line and love the new twist of rescuing birds instead of killing pigs. also better graphics than the other versions... so glad this is free!
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I saw the video for Rolling In The Deep, and I liked the song and the video itself.  I bought the cd on a whim, hoping to get into Adele.  It was a risk and a new discovery for me.  I played the cd and so far I only like 3 songs on the entire cd.  I like Rolling In The Deep, Rumour Has It and He Won't Go.  I think the song He Won't Go would be better suited for an actual R and B singer though.  I think the reason I'm not fully into Adele is her style of music (not into the whole 60's thing) and her voice, ironically.  After a few songs, I find myself a bit annoyed with her same style of singing.  I think she should take more risks with her voice and change it up some.  The raspy thing is a bit grading on the nerves and the howling like a wolf thing is also annoying.  I am also not crazy about the excessive ballads on the cd.  Lyrically, this is a good album though.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I can't download it, I get an error. Please fix it while it's free. It says that the price has changed and I have to cancel the purchase.
B002ZG980U|1.0|I found this film to be very confusing and tedious to watch.  It requires you to use too much of your brain power and it doesn't really offer you an escape from the world. It only makes you over-analyze existance and ruins the whole experience of dreaming, which should remain a mystery.  To make matters worse, Inception morphs into a brainless action movie towards the end, with car chases, explosions and rapid gun fire.  Not my cup of tea.
B0033DQGW2|1.0|This is the first of Dan Brown's books that I have read.  I hope the DaVinci Coce and Angels & Demons is better.  The characterizations are formulaic.  The true identity of the antagonist was obvious by the half way point of the book.  The ending was beyond cheesy.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|better than original,  score system is still obscure and bizarre but improved gameplay make it a great time waster. there's not as much of a storyline, as there was in the first, but that doesn't subtract from the fun.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|why i cant download this app in germany? it makes no sense. my device: htc desire with o2 network. please open the market for all!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|why are people reviewing this game based on at&amp;t market restrictions or amazon policys. its ridiculous. Review it on quality, fun, graphics, and performance. The game is great. As fun as the the others were and it's free!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Thanks to Rovio and Amazon for tge hot deal. This app is beautiful. Kerp yp the good work. We'll keep looking for more good stuff!
0802473156|5.0|My fiancee and I just finished going through this book, and it has enlightened us as to HOW we can love each other better.  Love isn't just about feelings and emotions, its about making choices and doing things for the other person, and this book really drives that home.  Written from a purely psychological perspective, so for those of you who are \\"afraid\\" of Christianity or get angry about theology, this is the book for you!  Personally, I would have liked to see the author tie faith into the mix some, but I understand his reason for not doing so.  I think that our marriage will be much stronger/happier now that we know which love language each of us has and how we can make the other feel more loved.
1574216988|5.0|This is another fabulous Zentangle book by the wonderful Sandy Steen. If you are an experienced tangler, you'll get even more ideas from \\"Yoga for your brain\\". I can't speak highly enough about Sandy's work and instructional material. Love it!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|i love watching these movies when my kids were little, they got a kick out of both of them.   the dvd's had great quality pictures and was fun to watch again
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Downloaded the appstore, jumped through hoops to enter cc info, but can't install the app. It takes forever to download, but when it's finally done you can't install it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|In the era of internet, 21st century this is something unbelievable. What do you gain with this restrictions? I was expecting this download... I feel really disappointed now.<br />Shame on you Amazon.
B000RGSOR8|5.0|This is a wonderful CD that has quite a number of gems on it. This is the  kind of cd that you can listen to and not have to skip through the track list. Buy this CD you will not be dissapointed. It is full of smart intelligent lyrics. So unlike most of todays music.
0140282033|5.0|You'll need a box of fine chocolates and a bottle of wine to go along with this gorgeous novel.  Decadent.  Enjoy!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great headphones for $8.... Base could be better but if your a treble kind of person, you will love the clarity!
B0049JPU8A|5.0|This album is incredible. The Script have really progressed with the tunes since their debut album. This cd is full of catchy songs, with more heartfelt emotional lyrics with plenty of rhythm & beat. Well worth the money. Amazing band, amazing music.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Like I said why do I need to put in my credit card info for a free game?  I am not giving out my CC info just for a free angry bird game sorry.
B000UO7IM4|5.0|Despite the description saying 'rigid' individual slipcases, they are, in fact, quite flimsy.  That, coupled with the fact that the set is devoid of any of the new liner notes produced for the rereleases of these albums, and you might ask yourself why the 5 stars.  Well, it's the music which eminates from a true master of this or any other genre.  These later day efforts from Monk may not be the whole Monk story but they are a critical piece and at this price, if you have any interest and don't already own at least two of these rereleases, you owe it to yourself to complete the journey.  The man is a music making miracle, an absolute original.  Conception, execution, sound qualilty, 5 stars hardly does it justice.  There can be no greater accolade than simply listening, that's what you do.<br /><br />Also recommended: Thelonious Monk Trio, Quartet and Big Band in Concert, At Town Hall, Monk's Music, Brilliant Corners, Alone in San Francisco, And John Coltrane, With John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall, Live at the It Club, London Collection(s).
B004SBS8LA|1.0|when I heard about Amazon is doing their own market I was genuinely excited. I thought Amazon should be better than Google working with apps quality and deals with publishers. Afterall, It's Amazon, right?  oh boys was I wrong...   Why the geo lockout Amazon and Rivio? As if android's market isn't fragmented enough already? failed! failed! failed!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Updating my review: This wasn't originally working on my VZW Droid Incredible, but after following some advice from an Android forum I got it to work. I simply mounted my phone to my computer and removed the \\".android_secure\\" folder from my SD card. Apparently this can get corrupted, and the phone will just regenerate it once the SD card is remounted.    Game is now working wonderfully -- great fun!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I understand why you wanted to give Amazon an exclusive, but Amazon only serves USA with their Appstore. I was able to get the iOS version in Canada, but am not allowed to have it on my Android device.     EPIC FAIL on Amazon's and Rovio's part.
0061876755|2.0|Spoiler Alert.  The book is fast-paced and fun, but the whole book fell apart for me when the hero casually kills someone who's bothering him near the end of it. After three hundred pages of cheering this hero on as he escapes from people trying to kill him, I was completely turned off when the hero just casually becomes a murderer himself.  In real life, it would be terrifying; in this book, it's merely dumb.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|There is an error \\"this app cannot be installed in your location\\".<br /><br />If the app is free, and the regular version available in Google Market worldwide, why not leave available for download for users outside US?<br /><br />I'm customer of Amazon for years, and I'm disapointed now.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|after going through the process of downloading the amazon app, turning on one-click, adding a payment method it only tells you at the end that its not available in my region!  why send me the email in the first place?  should have told me its not for UK at the start. and not available in my region? its a country, not a region!  waste of time and irritatingly US only.  uninstall!
B002BI6SMI|1.0|1st 20min the quality is like a bootleg copy.  The rest of the movie had alot of unnecessary movie mistakes. Overall a 1 time view is enough!!!
0440236738|5.0|This was the very first Harlan Coben book I read and I must say that I couldn't put it done. It kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat.  I don't usually read this genre but a friend gave me 2 of his books when I asked for something to read.  The other book he gave me was The Innocent.  I read it after Gone for Good and it paled in comparison;I put it down several times. The plot is quite thick and the story very layered.  Just when you think its stripped down, it ends with a shocking but happy and satisfying bang.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|App won't install because I don't have enough space, but I can't find the program's size anywhere.  The store should show how big an app is so people can know what they need.
B00322PK2G|5.0|After owning several metal watches I longed for something with a classic, modern looking, lighter design.  This Swatch watch caught my eye and when it arrived, it exceeded my expectations.  The design is even better looking in real life, it almost has a 'toy-like' funky quality to it!  The skinny little shafts of light yellow-green on the hands add a whimsical touch.  This just looks so fun with every outfit I wear and the basic cleanness of the design makes me happy every time I look at it.  The band is a glossy white and unlike some complaints I read, I find the ticking sound kind of cozy, it's not really that audible unless you focus on it.  Now my sister wants one of these she loves it so much on me!  I'd highly recommend this particular Swatch watch.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Kinda ironic that Angry Birds Rio is not available for customers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We are able to download the amazon appstore application but, what for if cant't use it to buy apps?  The Amazon Appstore for Android is not yet available in your region.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've got a feeling that this new version is going to fill a lot of bus time. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the christmas version of angry birds seasons (lots of physics glitches + force closed regularly), so I had somewhat low expectations of this version. However, this version is (so far) extremely well polished and smooth. The graphics are very high-quality.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a Great App, it is a good twist to the poular angry birds franchise.  A+ to Rovio.  AS FOR STUPID CUSTOMERS WHO RATE THIS APP BAD BECAUSE OF AMAZON, ITS NOT ANGRY BIRDS FAULT, SO WHY RATE IT DOWN????
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|way to organize. synchs with evernote on computer, and most other apps on phone so you  can access notes anywhere. great widget too. love this app!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Wow - new AppStore and a flagship Angry Birds app.    Now despite being an both an amazon.com and an amazon.co.uk Prime member, I can't \\"buy\\" this due to geographical restrictions.    So,    #1 Amazon Fail - launching a US only AppStore when you already have the capability to serve the world - PATHETIC!  #2 Rovio Fail - making this an Amazon AppStore exclusive, and by extension excluding most of the world - MORONIC!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it's free!!! you cant go wrong with that. automatic 5 stars!!! i love amazon now!!! best game ever people and oh did i mention that its free today!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you love Angry Birds you'll love this update. Better backgrounds and game play. Without ads! Performance seems improved on motorola droid. Get it today!
B000002UB6|3.0|After listening to \\"The Beatles: Let It Be\\" a couple of times, the only thing I can say about it is that it's probably not one of their greatest works. But then this is probably common for a last album, especially when the group was on the outs. I feel that this album definitely has something for everyone. There are tracks for those who are looking for inspiration (Let It Be & Across the Universe). And then there are tracks that kind of just go in different directions. Some of the music sounds like it's in the folk category. There were also some songs that having read the lyrics in conjunction with the tracks I still didn't understand and can wrap my head around. While Across the Universe and Let It Be held the hints of inspiration, I felt I didn't understand Across the Universe in full detail. I also felt the same way about Get Back. If the songs were written in the tradition of poetry, then that could potentially be why. Note: I don't really understand the language of poetry. I suppose if I listen to the album more and more, maybe I might be able to wrap my head around it. Most of the songs are written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. There are a few written by George Harrison, and also by all four of The Beatles. So, in that, the Fab Four show they can write their own material, instead of performing someone else's. In all honesty, while I understand that The Beatles have influenced music today as we know it, I simply cannot and do not understand why. While listening to the other Beatles albums and building up, I really had my hopes on Let It Be. However, I felt disappointed by it. Perhaps it could have been the dissention that I had read about during the making of the album. Perhaps they just grew tired of being The Beatles. I don't know for sure. But I do know that this album, and all of the other Beatles albums, will continue to stand the test of time. No Beatles collection would be complete without it.
B004CHURRS|5.0|I wasn't sure how Natalie's voice would fit these beautiful Handel arias but she was highly effective and lyrical - a home run!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am completely addicted to Angry Birds - original, Seasons, and now Rio.  Love the new layout and interface, and so far it works perfectly on my Archos 101 tablet. It's too bad the app is getting a lower rating because of issues with apparent phone/carrier limitations, extra 'work' (Really?) installing Amazon Apps, and availability to US only. Simply put, it is another awesome version added to a phenomenal game series.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like amazon free paid app a day this game improves on the original graphic wise removes adds feels like the game got too easy needs to be on regular Android market no install problems on my HTC Evo stock 2.2
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Game crashed on first level. Tried reinstall and everything, wont work. Very disappointed been waiting for months for this game. HTC EVO SHIFT    **Edit After fixing some problems on my end, the game works pefectly. Excellent game as I was anticipating.

B004L49K20|5.0|`All You Need Is Now' is Duran Duran's 13th studio album and put quite simply, is easily their best album since `Rio' back in 1982!    Although I have been a fan of this band for some 28 years, I certainly don't live in a Duran Duran bubble, where my obsession clouds my judgement; because I am the first admit that they have made some pretty poor albums over the years. Some fans of the band do have selective hearing and believe that everything Duran Duran creates is music gold, which is simply not true. However, here we have been presented with an album which is 100% pure solid gold! and its sheer quality and brilliance lies in the song writing, which is really saying something for a band who have been around for 30 years. Also, you have to applaud the genius that is Mark Ronson, he has breathed new life into a Duran Duran which had lost its direction slightly with previous album `Red Carpet Massacre', although I personally thought that the album was not bad at all, but the R'n'B sound of that album was not what the fans wanted and it bombed. Mark Ronson came in and reminded the band of their history and completely revived them and their sound. On the whole the album sounds essentially like Duran Duran circa 1981-84, but there are also elements that remind you of the `Notorious' period and even into the 90's with `The Wedding Album'. This album could have so easily ended up sounding dated but it doesn't, as Ronson's production manages to keep it sounding fresh and current.    The albums title track is probably more 90's Duran Duran than 80's, but it's an absolute gem and features a soaring chorus that simply sets the tone for the rest of the album.    `Blame The Machines' is a song inspired by a true story of a man who took his Sat Nav directions too literally and ended up with him driving the wrong way down a one way street! Great pace and drive in this track and I love the guitars and the synths that runs right through it. There is an excellent part in the middle where ITV newsreader Nina Hossain brilliantly provides the dominating voice of the controlling Sat Nav!    `Being Followed' sounds like it could have been on `Rio'. A song essentially about paranoia, it has a totally infectious chorus which compliments the verses wonderfully. Dom Brown's guitars shine again, this time sounding like The Cure at times.    According to many fans the lush `Leave A Light On' sounds like `Save A Prayer', although for me it sounds more similar to the somewhat forgotten great Duran Duran track `Out Of My Mind'. The song is a beautifully constructed, with a laid back, late summers evening vibe, stunning!.    `Safe' is disco funk and features Ana Matronic from the Scissor Sisters with a great rap/vocal which can only be likened to Debbie Harry's on Blondie's `Rapture'. By no means the best song on the album, but by not bad either, its just that some fans have stated that it maybe sounds more like the Scissor Sisters featuring Duran Duran, and they could be right.    `Girl Panic!' is proper classic Duran Duran! It's like it 1981 all over again. Shouts `Hit' at you very loudly and at their peak would have been a massive hit for sure. Someone recently said that it sounded like all of Duran Duran's best singles mashed into one song and that is not far off the mark. Genius!    `The Man Who Stole A Leopard' is my favourite song on the album. What do we have in here?, well there are elements of `Tel Aviv' and `The Chauffeur' and a full orchestra (Conducted by Owen Pallet - Arcade Fire) which just adds to the song and adds a dark atmosphere to the song, words really can't do this track justice. Six minutes of Duran Duran at their very very best, just sit back and immerse yourself into what is set to become an all time Duran Duran classic, it really is quite glorious (Featuring backing vocals by Kelis and News Report by Nina Hossain).    `Other People's Lives' is yet another great moment. A fantastic chorus and also reminds me a little bit of `Great Escape' era Blur!    `Mediterranea' is a shimmery stunner. A mid paced song about getting away from it all, this really could become the new `Ordinary World'.    `Too Bad You're So Beautiful' goes back to the `Rio' era Duran Duran. If you ever loved `Hold Back The Rain and `Last Chance On The Stairway' then you will adore this.    `Runway Runaway' and they just keep on coming, another cracker this, but more of a `Seven & The Ragged Tiger' vibe here. Effortlessly catchy. My only gripe here is that it's over too quickly!    `Before The Rain' is a superb way to end the show, so to speak! Dark and brooding, it slowly builds and builds, right up to the intense marching band drums at the end.    Duran Duran are back to what they do best and lets just hope they decide to stay around for a few more years yet!    ***Additional notes***  `A Diamond In The Mind' and `Return To Now' are both very nice short orchestral interludes (based on the albums title track) of just over a minute each. And although they don't really stand out on their own, they do give the album a wonderful flow.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is another fantastic addition to the Angry Birds family. The game is played the same way as the rest of the Angry Birds but there are completely different levels and enemies. The look of the game has been updated and looks great. Rovio Mobile has done an amazing job at keeping the game fresh and a must have, Angry Birds Rio is another example of this. With tons of new levels and enemies this game has kept me attached to my phone!...<br />If you would like to read more of my review or check out other great android reviews check out [...]
B000002IZM|5.0|The Ultimate CD if you're looking for a moody atmospheric piece of music with hints of dystopia.  The best track in my opinion is \\"blade runner blues.\\"  It's a fusion of a hollywood movie, a mysterious crime drama paperback, and an experience of the bleak yet fascinating neon wilderness of urban Japan.  I am satisfied with it.  A great buy.
030746363X|5.0|Not everything works for everyone, but the program outlined in this book worked for me! I decided to try it after seeing the results my friend had after doing it. I don't normally do things like this; I don't read \\"diet books,\\" or get on board with the phases and crazes out there. I had been finding myself getting to an age where I was gaining weight easily and it was harder to get rid of than when I was in my 20's. I purchased the necessary suppliments and followed the diet as closely as I could. My only complaint about the book was that it didn't have even a few recipes to get people started on the diet, or a clear-cut list/chart of what you can and can't eat. Plus, some of the dietary info seemed contradictory to me. I'm a self-proclaimed amateur chef, so it was easy for me to prepare meals within the guidelines, but I imagine many people struggle getting started on it.    The first couple days I was tired; I ad been so used to fueling my body with carbs. By the end of the first week I had LOST 6 POUNDS! I had been eating 3 meals a day and felt satisfied! When I made it to my first \\"cheat day\\" eating all that processed food made me feel awful, and I couldn't wait to get back on track!    I don't know if I will stick with the program FOREVER, but it will forever change the way I eat, and look at food. I didn't read the section on sleeping better, however, since I've been following the diet/supplement program I have been having the best sleep ever!
B004GYY714|5.0|I've been looking for a good real radio app for a while, and this was the one I was looking for.  Local or not, there are tons of radio stations listed.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Not installing on stock droid x. Been having problems installing updates for the other angry birds, but fixed that by unmounting sd card. Can't unfunny for this because its required to install via sd
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Sure wish I could install it! Says I need more space, but I have over 40mb on the phone and 1.5GB on teh SD too. Amazon Market BLOWS...bring this to the regular Android Market!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This version of Angry Birds is definitely cleaner and more visually appealing than the others. Plus, there are plenty of updates to come. The lack of pigs is sad, though.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Improved graphics over previous Angry Birds apps with a great Amazon AppStore download process &amp; plays well on the Nexus S with Android 2.3 Gingerbread
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i did all requires steps. downloaded the store. updated one click settings and added a credit card and it still wont download. tmobile g2. so for all you aholes who say everyone is an idiot that cant figure it out, f u. i followed steps and i am still getting an error.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The 10 year anniversary concert was enough.  But the 25th Anniversary Concert was outstanding!  It's one we will watch over and over.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Beyond the complete nonsense of the amazon app store in the first place, this game simply will not install on my stock droid x. Complete waste of my time on amazon's part.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|It's just another angry birds game... yet again its the boring and pointless game of slingshotting birds at objects... idk why though, birds can fly and do not need slingshots...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Posting this again because this worked for me after having install issues.  The game is great once I installed it    \\"Hook up your phone to your PC, find the device in windows explorer, CUT and paste the .android_secure folder (near the top of the list) onto your PC (this folder is corrupt). The folder will recreate on your phone when you unplug from the computer. Disconnect your phone and than install Rio again. Worked Great for me and many others!! Excellent Game once you get it installed!     PS- for this to work your SD card MUST be mounted or you will not see the .android_secure folder.\\"
B00004YX39|5.0|I never knew who played the amazing guitar solo on \\"Third World Man\\".  Now I know it was Larry Carlton, one of many great guitarists to play on Steely Dan's albums.  Thanks.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The program installed very easily on my phone (Sprint HTC Evo4G) by following the on screen instructions.      I opened it up and played the first few levels with no issues either.  It has different graphics and a slightly different interface than the previous angry birds apps. Can't wait to play more.  Free the birds!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|What more is there to say? This movie rocks. It is an excellent film adaptation/complement to Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" album, and it delivers a wonderful viewing and listening experience. I only wish the film hadn't scrapped \\"Hey You\\" from the musical line-up.
B003CH9PV8|5.0|I love this show! Though I still wish the main actor wouldn't take all the awards away from Jon Hamm.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I thought Angry Birds couldnt get any better, and I was proved wrong! Sure the pigs are gone, but that doesnt make the game any less fun. Its the Angry Birds that we're used to, except the graphics are better and gameplay is smooth. There are hidden items that you have to find as well! Great game, it still had me cursing it! Keep them coming and thank you! (Played on original droid)
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is a wonderful video in HD. Amazing time lapse shots.  Lot of hard work behind this work.  But I must admit for some reason it did not reach the perfection of Planet Earth when it comes to keeping the interest of the kids.  Definitely a must-see.  Thanks.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Why are you giving angry birds a bad review when you have an issue with amazon. First of all all amazon clearly states that the app store is only for USA customers. Also please make sure your device has install from unknown sources checked and you are not on AT&T. As for the game angry birds rio is just as great as all the other iterations of this game. Once again please don't lower the rating of a great game because of a gripe you have with Amazon or the fact that you don't read carefully.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm not understanding all of these negative comments considering if it were on the android app store it would be all 5 stars. get over it people.
0679428895|4.0|A more appropriate title for this book would be \\"Amazing Roman Engineering Feats: The Aqueduct\\".  Don't' get me wrong- I think what the Roman engineers accomplished by providing running water to cities along the dry Southern Italian coast was nothing short of amazing and I did enjoy the story; however the majority of the book is about the aqueducts.<br /><br />Marcus Attilius, an \\"Aquarius\\" (aqueduct engineer) is sent from Rome to Misenum because their region's Aquarius is missing. What he finds when he gets there is a mystery surrounding his predecessor's disappearance, aqueducts failing and government corruption in Pompeii. The young engineer in his haste to prove his worth promises Pliny, the ruler of the area, that he can repair the aqueducts in 48 hours and restore running water to all the cities in the region. He sets off on this task 2 days before Mt. Vesuvius erupts. Can he accomplish his goal in time?<br /><br />This was a quick, easy read which brings to life Roman culture, politics and the effects of the eruption on people in Pompeii and other coastal areas.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|wouldn't expect anything less..I'm an angry birds geek..love it.  as for Amazon stepping up, its about time.  don't like this 25 word minimum rule though.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The Angry Birds game just got better! Awesome animations, exciting game play, and best of all, NO ADS!!! As if I wasn't addicted to Angry Birds enough, they go and give me a whole new game to spend my days on.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Love the new Angry Birds.  Controls are a bit touchier than the original which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  My son also loves the new app and won't stop playing it.
B004KA9MQO|3.0|Jennifer Hudson is incapable of giving a vocal performance without something worthwhile resulting. That works in favor of the dozen tunes that rest uneasily together on the vocalist's second LP \\"I Remember Me.\\"<br /><br />A singer who is not also a songwriter depends on the talent of others to create material prior to the point his or her own work is required. That presents a double-edged sword for Hudson here - the tunes are primarily banal and unmemorable, with sloppy, uninteresting choruses and unimaginative, lifeless production, yet they also make her energy and investment as a singer - that is to say, her raw talent - especially evident.<br /><br />The material is not world-class, but the singer is.<br /><br />Hudson skews toward the bombastic, at many times radiating the aura of an over-rehearsed actor, but elsewhere she gifts the songs with pulse, heart and soul, even though they rarely deserve it. She has a voice capable of stripping the varnish off a foot locker and she is unafraid to use it.<br /><br />She sounds best on the 70s soul/disco mash-up \\"Everybody Needs Love,\\" with its syllable-bursting energy and simple, effective chorus. \\"Angel\\" is also above average with soldier march beats. It makes great use of Hudson's range and expressiveness. So do \\"Why Is It So Hard?\\" and \\"Don't Look Down,\\" the latter of which bounces along with uncontainable energy and hard-won, rallying optimism. She shines, unsurprisingly, on the seminal \\"Feeling Good.\\"<br /><br />Songs with anti-intellectual, dumbed-down titles such as \\"No One Gonna Love You\\" and \\"Where You At\\" are named in a way that reflects their earthbound, uninsightful content. They insult the listener in how they pander to what Hudson's core audiences (supposedly) already know and expect. Those two tunes, as well as \\"I Got This,\\" are mildly pleasing in spite of their lack of exciting, interesting choruses and poor lyrics only because of Hudson's gusto and salesmanship. That applies also to Diane Warren's \\"Still Here,\\" a slice of musical high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />Many names line the production credits yet the sound is largely singular throughout - icy, calculated and absolutely devoid of warmth and passion. The sounds are fresh out of a toolbox, with hardly a musician in sight. Hudson cannot help but be disadvantaged by this. She would have been more at home in the era when Luther Vandross was recording his most important records.<br /><br />\\"I Remember Me\\" is a flawed album. It is not unenjoyable, and it serves as a nice affirmation of Hudson's vocal prowess, but it will not leave a lasting impression on the popular culture or individual listener.uctose corn syrup.

B003L16FAE|5.0|I was just 15 years-old when I first saw Predator and I loved it but honestly I didn't expect it to become a sci-fi classic. After 25 years later, Predator remains to be one great sci-fi-horror adventure that has the power to entertain and surprise viewers even today. Somewhat similar to concept of Alien, a creature from outer space hunting down humans, Predator is unique in its tone and style and sets itself apart from Alien.<br />Movie begins with a group of US army special forces sent on a special mission in the jungles somewhere in south America. It appears to be a typical Hollywood action movie with a lot of explosions, things blowing up, etc. but that's just an introduction to something bigger. Shortly after their mission is completed successfully, they sense the presence of an unearthly being that seems to monitor and prey on humans.<br /><br />Predator's success comes from many elements: Just like Alien, the viewer doesn't get to see The Predator which adds suspense and mystery. The Predator camouflages himself like a chameleon and appears almost like an apparition in the jungle setting. It has special weapons that allows himself to kill from a distance but it also likes to slay its victims at close range. It collects remains of his victims. I think one of the reasons for the suspense is the fact that Predator is against the special forces, a fine group of individuals who are trained to kill the enemy in combat. They are not easy preys. Alien took out its enemies pretty easily without a fight. This group puts up a fight: they plan, set traps for The Predator but the suspense doesn't reach its maximum point until the final battle.<br /><br />The visual effects are pretty impressive even at today's standards. The predator's apparition is nicely done and as well as his actual appearance. He looks very real. As in any great sci-fi horror movie, the score is great and sets the tone of each scene perfectly.<br /><br />Ultimate Hunter Edition Blu Ray is awesome. Picture and sound quality are excellent like you would expect from a Blu ray movie. There are tons of extras:<br />-Predator: Evolution of a Species: Hunters of Extreme Perfection (11 minutes documentary)<br />-Commentary by Director John McTiernam<br />-Text Commentary by film historian Eric Lichtenfeld<br />-If it bleeds we can kill it: The Making of Predator (28 minutes documentary)<br />-Inside the Predator<br />  -Classified Action (5 minutes featurette)<br />  -The Unseen Arnold (5 minutes fearurette about Arnold's performance)<br />  -Old Painless (3 minutes featurette about the machine gun in the movie)<br />  -The Life Inside - A Tribute to Kevin Peter Hall (4 minutes featurette about the actor who played Predator,  Kevin Peter Hall 1955 - 1991)<br />  -Camouflage (5 minutes featurette on the challenges of using camouflage)<br />  -Welcome to the Jungle (2 minutes featurette on shooting in the jungle)<br />  -Character Design (5 minutes featurette on developing the characters)<br />-Special Effects<br />  -'Red Suit' special effects<br />  -Predator (Red) looking down (shots of Predator in red suit _ 1 minute )<br />  -Predator (Red) in jungle (shot of predator in red suite standing on the branch_1 minute)<br />  -Predator (Red) Main Walking Layer (20 seconds)<br />  -Camouflage Tests<br />  -Camouflage Effect Moth (35 seconds)<br />  -Camouflage Effects Layers (1 minute 12 seconds)<br />-Short Takes<br />  -John McTiernan learning film (3 minutes featurette).<br />  -Jesse's Ultimate Goal (2 minutes 18 seconds)<br />  -Stan Winston: Practical Joker  (3 minutes)<br />  -Don't Drink the Water (2 minutes)<br />-Deleted Scenes and Outtakes<br />-Theatrical Trailers<br />-Photo Gallery<br />-Predator Profile (this is a cool section depicting and explaining predator's weapons and anatomy)<br />-Predators: Sneak Peek<br /><br />Overall, I think $12-13 is a super deal to own this movie on Blu ray.re excellent like you would expect from a Blu ray movie.

B004J4WQ46|4.0|The Strokes ride into town at 120 miles per hour with pistols drawn on \\"Angles.\\" The songs sway and shimmer with unbridled ebullience, consummate musicianship and fast-moving, lightening-sharp (but not calculated) precision that do not slip away until the album's short, sweet (34-minute) playing time has elapsed.<br /><br />The results are simply inspiring, and certainly ear-pleasing.<br /><br />Nick Valensi's inspired guitar-playing accentuates the mercurial, idiosyncratic vocals of lead singer Julian Casablancas so uncannily well that the reality that Casablancas recorded his vocals separately is difficult to accept - even a bit disappointing. But the sounds that emanate from high-octane cuts such as \\"Metabolism\\" and the atmospheric, breathy \\"Two Kinds of Happiness,\\" both helped along by Fabrizio Moretti's precise, emphatic drumming, speak for themselves.<br /><br />The Strokes are a little less Peter Gabriel, a little more Elton John this time around. That is to say, while the depth and content of previous records may not be in full evidence here, the choruses are often riper and stronger. \\"Angles\\" is ideal for blaring at full blast on summer drives through shore towns, not for Zach Braff to mine for material for his next quasi-indie soundtrack.<br /><br />Complaints that the band are at unsure artistic crossroads are not without credibility. \\"Angles\\" is the sound of a band taking all of its most fail-safe, commercially savvy elements and overstuffing ten muscular slices of guitar pop with them. If the results are not a sign of progression, they are neither a sign of stagnation or lack of attention - the end product is clearly one carefully honed and considered. The swashbuckling, hook-heavy \\"Under the Cover of Darkness\\" and the equally effusive \\"Taken for a Fool\\" are proof enough of that.<br /><br />A joyous, intelligent album of delightful musical confection should not be overthought or undersold, and that is precisely what \\"Angles\\" is. The dedication of these musicians to top-quality songcraft positively overflows. It may not win The Strokes an onslaught of converts - perhaps their soon forthcoming fifth record will come closer to the full breadth of their artistic promise - but it is certain to please the listeners for whom it was intended.ively overflows.

0756404738|4.0|The Name of the Wind was as near to perfect as any book can get and so comparatively the second installment isn't quite there. The main problem I found was that the pace in certain portions of the story (Vintas/Bandits, Fae, Adem) slowed from a gallop to a plodding walk. It is during these \\"drags\\" that you can see Rothfuss' focus switching from the story itself to world building. He takes the time to show us the time and energy he has put into his world and the depth it truly has. I only have two issues with this. The first is that he sacrifices pacing to accomplish it. The second is that the experiences Kvothe lived through didn't really show us much of a change or growth in his character. This isn't to say he didn't grow or change, but we didn't get to SEE that growth or feel those experiences permeate and change his internal views, beliefs, and values in a tangible way. **SPOILER** For example his killing of those 20 something mercenaries didn't really change him or effect him in a way that you could see until MUCH later in the book where he dispatches the 9 \\"troopers\\" and that is only an external change, not an internal one.    Those are really my only gripes and I figured I should address them first. Rothfuss' grasp on world and word has significantly improved since the Name of the Wind and I don't see how anyone can contest that. You really come to feel strongly (one way or another) and naturally for almost all of the secondary characters, you can see the depth he put into his world was also put into his characters. I was sucked into the story from the beginning and only stopped to consider the things that truly bothered me as I finished the final few lines of the book. If you are a fan of this genre, this book should be atop your to-read pile.    All of that said, I cannot, for the life of me, see how this is the second installment of a three part series. I just don't see how the next book can bring this story to a close in a comfortable way without sacrificing much. In the Name of the Wind you are made to believe that the Kvothe telling the story has come a long way and accomplished much and come to learn the secrets of the world  and at the end of The Wise Man's Fear I just don't feel like the Kvothe in the story told is anywhere near the Kvothe telling the story. Thinking on this too much leaves a bad taste in my mouth and so I will place my faith in the author and believe that he has an idea of how to end this tale without spoiling it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|People should be reviewing the app and not the service!  There are other mediums to voice your concerns.  Not Rovio's nor Angry birds' fault!  This is a really great game.  Another thing that has to go is the 25 word minimum for the review, I dont usually want to leave a worded review, but almost always, gladly, leave amount-of-stars reviews.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a great sequel to the original and seasons.  gameplay is much, much better now.  there isn't the lag that existed in previous versions. The slow touch interface from previous versions is no longer there the screen is very receptive to touch input now
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This isn't just a coat of new paint slapped on Angry Birds so they can do a movie tie-in. It is actually different goals and different levels than what is available in the other versions of Angry Birds. This is definitely worth the $1 and the game and graphics are put together well.
B002HR1W1K|4.0|This was a great movie if you're a movie lover. Lot's of references to other films of the genre and past films of the duo. Saying that, it still is able to stand on it's own legs. The bluray has everything the dvd did when they came out plus a little extra and a digital copy which I always find helpful.
0451457994|5.0|2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY is much more than a space opera like STAR WARS (and that's coming from a die-hard STAR WARS fan).  It is a telescope for those who have never looked through one.  It explores the wonders of space, the stars, and the breathless vastness of outer space.  For my part, it throws the reader into the limitless glories of God's creation (mind you, the book is written from an agnostic viewpoint).    The storyline spans millenia, and the characters are never dull but always multidimensional.  The odyssey begins for prehistoric man - not knowing where his cosmic journey will take his descendants.  The end of the odyssey (at least for the first book) will see astronaut Dave Bowman meet the stars and look on them, science, and mankind through different eyes and from a thoroughly different perspective.    The skeptic may say, \\"That doesn't sound like much of an odyssey to me: the first man doesn't know where the adventure ends or even what constitutes an ending.  And the final man doesn't know how it began.\\"  Ay, there's the rub!  It's not their odyssey; it's ours!  It's the reader's odyssey - through space, the finite and the infinite.      I just read 2001 for the second time.  I have little doubt I will read it for a third and fourth as well.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game  awesome adition to an already superb game. Rio has many great new features and amazing graphics. i hope this title keeps pumping out the quality gaming i expect from an android market.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|In the age of the internet, geographical restrictions shouldn't exist. I want to believe it's a great game but in the Twitter lingo this release is a massive fail.
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Wow. That's definitely my first thought after reading this book. Of course it comes with a little bit sadness because it is the book in the series, but it was certainly an exciting finish. That being said there were some things that I didnt like as much in this book. The plot isnt anything new. Alex is forced by MI6 to go undercover, because there is of course a mission that would only work with a child. How on earth did MI6 work without Alex for so long? Anyways Alex is forced to go to Egypt to investigate something in a school, because MI6 found the body of a high ranking member of Scorpia floating in the Thames, and they find a clue on the man's phone that tells them they need to send someone to Cairo. I won't go any farther because I want to avoid spoilers, but it's pretty much more of the same, as I said before.    What I liked:  Fast paced storyline  Surprising plot twists  Major character dies  Return of a villain from one of the first 3 books    What I didn't like as much:  Unoriginal plot  Alex was...dumb at times    Despite it's faults, Scorpia Rising was very exciting, and i will certainly reread it at some point in the future, and I'm looking forward to Horowitz's book about Yassen. Thanks!
031261246X|5.0|I recently had the pleasure of interviewing Mark Russinovich about his new novel, Zero Day. The episode is available now on AuthorsCast.com.    Zero Day really is a great thriller in the tradition of writers like Tom Clancy, Michael Crichton, Dan Brown, and others. If you enjoy those authors, you will love this book.    It's a very well-paced read, and quick too -- I read it in three sittings over a couple of days, and found it difficult to put down. The characters are fully-fleshed, the descriptions vivid, and the action (especially in the second half of the book) kept me sitting bolt-upright the whole time. I couldn't help but think what a great movie this would make. I hope someone buys the rights -- it deserves the big screen treatment.    While this is a work of fiction, it is so well-informed by the author's extensive subject knowledge that by the end, you will realize how all too real the threat of cyber-terrorism really is.     This is a book that will do for surfing the Internet, what Jaws did for actual surfing!
B004J4WQ46|3.0|It really does pain to write these words particularly after reading the huge claims of the recent BBC review that \\"Angles\\" the new record by the Strokes \\"might actually be their very best record yet\\". Thus hopes were raised and a genuine feeling of excitement was generated at the prospect. However we are back in musical Groundhog Day and even guitarist Nick Valensi has since admitted that \\"I feel like we have a better album in us\\". Frankly on this evidence you sense that may this might just be wishful thinking and sadly for those who have invested hours of prayer trying to persuade the great music God in the sky to smile again on J Casablancas and co a sense of disappointment will follow.<br /><br />It's not that \\"Angles\\" is a bad album, it's pretty good in some parts and a couple of the songs are top drawer. At times when the band kick into that great Strokes groove on the classy single \\"Under cover of darkness\\" and the brilliant power pop of \\"Two kinds of happiness\\" and \\"Taken for a fool\\" the great times come flooding back and you think ....yes! Perhaps the early weight of expectation on this New York band was always a mighty millstone to carry but it did seem possible at the time of \\"Is this it\\" that the ghosts of Television, Talking Heads and mutter it quietly the Velvet Underground were being resurrected and rejuvenated. From the amazing debut onwards to every subsequent release you wanted them to succeed with every ounce of your soul. The narrative behind the album however reveals a band reluctantly coming together after five years with Casablancas agreeing to a democratic input from all band members reflecting all angles (although recording his vocals separately). But the result of all this collaboration inevitably leads to a lack of coherence. In this sense the comment in Slant magazine is painful but probably true that \\"most of the time the album sounds like a divorce settlement being pieced together one painstaking line at a time\\".<br /><br />Thus we have \\"Games\\" sounding like a bad Human League song, the silly opener \\"Machu Pichu\\" starts off with cod reggae like a latter day \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\" and then somehow mutates into the Thompson Twins \\"We are detective\\". The bottom is truly scrapped with the tuneless dour synth pop of \\"Your so right\\"; while \\"Call me back\\" shows no sign whatsoever of ever working out what type of song it wants to be. Its true that \\"Gratisfaction\\" has a nice pop sensibility but it sounds like it was lifted from a Thin Lizzy song. Things finish strongly however with two great songs the powerful \\"Metabolism\\" and the albums highlight the genuinely lovely \\"Life is simple in the moonlight'.<br /><br />\\"Angles\\" then is a decent Strokes album, which is the biggest criticism you can level at it. Ultimately it's the sound of a band that used to be cool and edgy struggling to be relevant and wondering what to do next. Can even the most uncritical Strokes fan say with hand on heart that this album is even on par for example with the very underrated \\"Room on fire\\"? Indeed I think it has great deal of continuity with \\"First Impressions\\". Listening to \\"Angles\\" is like witnessing a once great team pulling in different directions and looking for someone to take charge on the field of play. Sorry to rain on the parade here since I truly wanted this to be brilliant and to signal that the Strokes have a glorious future. But it is with heavy regret that I have to say that it doesn't appear to achieve either of those aims.\\"Games\\" sounding like a bad Human League song, the silly opener \\"Machu Pichu\\" starts off with cod reggae like a latter day \\"Dreadlock Holiday\\" and then somehow mutates into the Thompson Twins \\"We are detective\\".

4770031246|4.0|\\"The Just Bento Cookbook: Everyday Lunches to Go\\" is not your typical cookbook.  It is sectioned off mostly into meals, which at first takes some adjusting to navigate efficiently.  While I get the intent of putting full meal examples together (with great alternatives for both main and side item variations and options), I feel a bit jumbled when trying to find a recipe for the cabbage I want to use, or just looking for a small side to add to an almost complete meal.   The flip side to that is great examples of how to organize full meals, including morning scheduled time charts to efficiently put them together in 15 minutes before rushing off to work!    The book contains a lot of bento recipes, tips, and ideas.  For the bento newbie (like me), it is a nice intro/launching guide to preparing great bentos.  The information on what can be made in advanced, and how long certain items will last in the fridge or freezer makes it very easy to start planning your bentos out.  As a cookbook, I feel it lacks a bit in recipes overall.  As a reference for ideas and meals (especially packed lunches for work), I think it will inspire a few more creations and occasionally be thumbed through for a recipe.  It is in no way a `go to' reference cookbook, but it does not seem to be the intention.  The general feel of this book makes the thought of preparing bentos far less intimidating, which I would assume is the goal.  For that reason I would say I am overall happy with the purchase, but I wouldn't likely replace my copy again.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|What bad Idea to release angry birds rio on amazon appstore only and not be able to buy the app in europe. Btw giving away the app for free on day one for free ist a good idea but honestly, your reputation of the whole appstore is now gone because you can't buy or download free apps in europe. So you made a gift to US Customers and the Europeans are without it. Btw it's not the 99 cent its the whole not available in your country part
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Congratulations Amazon, NOT. You have made it very clear to the rest of us, well done. You do know that America is not the world don't you. Why do you advertise around the world when it is only  available in the US???? VERY, VERY, VERY POOR.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|why send me a mail, entice me with Angry Birds - and then tell me that it's not available outside of the US? ??!    AMAZON STOP WASTING MY TIME AND GOODWILL!  btw this just costed you a kindle that i won't buy anymore
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Yet again, another company who is oblivious that a world exists outside of America. \\"Not available in your region\\". After downloading the app, setting up payment details and setting up one click, THEN it decides to stop me downloading. I know the review should be about the product and not Amazon, but Rovio have just as much a part to play in this. Until the Amazon store was available internationally, Rovio should have released it on the standard Android Marketplace. Very, very dissapointing indeed.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|First off all with Amazon opening the app store we all know that Amazon is a reliable shopping experince unlike the android market where any unscrupulous developer could bilk you for you bank accounts.  Good show Amazon.  That being said this is by far the best angry birds release to date for the Android.  Amaziing graphics, great audio and gameplay.  A very good first release.  Now we see if Amazon can keep it up.  I am using a Droid X and the appstore application installed with no issues and angry birds went in quickly thereafter.
0439023491|4.0|\\"When you're in the arena...you just remember who the enemy is\\"<br />Katniss Everdeen has survived the 74th Hunger Games, but that doesn't mean life is a walk in the park. The 75th Hunger Games mark the Quarter Quell, a special anniversary of the Hunger Games, and Katniss, as a victor, is expected to make her rounds to the Districts to promote the games. That means continuing her charade of being madly in love with Peeta, avoiding causing any more sparks of rebellion, and trying to keep on President Snow's good side. But things don't go as they seem as the 75th Hunger Games approaches<br /><br />I Liked:<br />This book is fantastic! It isn't very often I read a sequel that is just as good or better than the original, but mark Catching Fire as one of the few that does!<br />Our characters return in all their glory. Katniss continues to seek out protection for her mother, her sister, Gale, and Peeta, thinking little of her own self in the process. She continues to be an intelligent, capable protagonist while also not becoming an omniscient Messiah figure in the process. Heck, most of the time, she tries NOT to a lead rebellion! Peeta continues to charm as the poor, \\"rejected\\" boy, having to use his words to cleverly make up for Katniss' brusque personality. Haymitch is back, guiding our victors through their trials, all the while barely staying sober It's so good and refreshing to read a sequel in which our favorite characters don't drastically change into some facsimile of what they were.<br />But what I found most impressive was how Catching Fire refused to repeat the same storyline as The Hunger Games. I've noticed in series (specifically for children or young adults) that this is the case. Not here. There is a Hunger Games that occurs, but it in no way is similar to the one in The Hunger Games. We have the starts of rebellion, Katniss must try to quell the rebellion to save those she loves, and absolutely no Romantic Triangle from hell (despite many claims to the contrary, there really is no Team Peeta/Team Gale). I'd love to detail more of what made this novel special, but I am afraid I would be leaving behind massive spoilers, and that would just ruin the surprise in the novel. And since this is a novel you should read, I wouldn't do that at all.<br />Closely tied in to above is how the book kept me guessing. Just when I thought I knew where the book was going (\\"Oh, it's going to be a rebellion novel\\", \\"Oh, it's going to be a travel novel\\"), Collins took the book in a completely different direction. And that direction was both good and surprising and MADE SENSE.<br /><br />I Didn't Like:<br />If there was one thing I didn't like, it was how dense Katniss was. There were numerous incidents displaying rebellion or some other plot point (that I can't tell you because of spoilers!) that were obvious to me, and I am certainly not the most astute reader in the universe. And yet, Katniss was completely oblivious. Does it keep with her character? Yes, but here, it is somewhat more annoying and definitely on a larger scale.<br />Also, it does take quite a bit of time for the real \\"action\\" to get going. The first part is more than a little bit slow and plodding as it sets up the last portion and even the third book.<br /><br />Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:<br />Mild (PG).<br />Katniss and Peeta share a bed (rather chastely) on a few occasions. Finnick is said to be quite the Ladies' Man. Johanna walks around in the buff at one point.<br />Heavy. The whole point of the Hunger Games is to kill all 23 other candidates. Some of the deaths are off-screen, but others are pretty detailed and bloody.<br /><br />Overall:<br />What are you doing reading this review? Go out, find this book however you can, and read it already! If you loved The Hunger Games, you won't regret it.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|I bet the game is awesome.. However, after I  downloaded it, it fails to install with no real reason given. (tried twice). Also can't download without card mounted.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another dope edition to the Angry Birds collection. I dont understand the low scores people are just retarded. This game is straight even though my phone has crashed a little.

Now I'm able to support the developer and not deal with any annoying ads, so kudos to Rovio and Amazon for finally providing this option to us.    Just to clear up any confusion, this paid copy of the game will install over your existing free copy of Angry Birds Season (go to the Updates menu in the Amazon app store on your phone to find it).  All of your progress will be carried over into the paid version of the game, so you have nothing to fear from buying this!

B004SBS8LA|1.0|It crashes after the instructions on the first level.  Evo Shift 4g.  Pretty disappointing for the flagship app of this app store. 25 words minimum.
B000000W5N|5.0|In The Stones versus The Beatles debate, I will always side with The Beatles. However, Sticky Fingers proves to me The Stones were capable of operating on the same level. The album is conceptual and creative. It holds a glimmer of the sixties while infusing 70s blues and straight up rock. I love this album and will never tire of it. Wild Horses is one of the most beautiful songs ever written and Can't You Hear Me Knocking has an incredible guitar riff. Worth the price of admission just for these two songs.
B004L49K20|5.0|Love this album.   It is such an inspiring fun album.  This album reminds me of the the Duran of the old days with a slightly updated more current sound.  Mark Ronson really helped to push the guys into the right direction.   This is the album they were trying to make when they made RCM...but that album didn't reach too great of heights, this one does on ALL levels.   My Favorite Tracks are: Being Followed, The Man Who Stole a Leopard, Before the Rain, and Mediterrania. If you like Duran then be sure not to miss this one it will be a classic.
1439102724|3.0|I have read and enjoyed Jodi's work before.  I don't expect great art, but an interesting story and characters and a thoughtful topic. So when Sing You Home came out, I expected an interesting and compelling read. Ultimately I was disappointed.    The beginning of the book was a great set-up -- I could see how the various characters got into the situations they did and why they were primed for conflict.  But once the conflict started, I thought the characters -- especially Max and Vanessa -- became very one-dimensional. It was hard for me to sympathize with anyone frankly.  The depiction of the Christian church as being anti-gay was stereotypical and inconsistent with my experience, as my church is a reconciling congregation and very welcoming to gays.  In fact, we had a gay assistant pastor for awhile.  Also, I'm a lawyer and I thought the courtroom scenes/reactions etc were very unrealistic. The questioning was amateurish and both lawyers' behavior was, in my opinion, unprofessional  In short, the author just didn't continue with the kind of character and plot development that seemed realistic to me.  ( a much better treatment of a similar kind of conflict is Tom Perrotta's \\"The Abstinence Teacher.\\")  So it was hard for me to enjoy the book after about the mid-point because I had such a problem with the credibility of the situation.
B004LP601S|4.0|Oh how it's been so long. You don't have to worry, 'cause they're still the same band!!<br /><br />I like Panic at the Disco a lot.  They're the only band in their genre that I think has any talent.  I liked A Fever you Cant Sweat Out a lot, I just though it was a tad too poppy.  And Pretty Odd is one of my favorite albums ever.  Vices and Virtues falls somewhere in between.<br /><br />This album sounds like a mix between their 2 previous albums, it's more mature than their first, and more rockin' than their second. Overall, it's pretty upbeat, other than \\"Always.\\"  Panic! is back with some more synth and electronic sounds, but they didn't over-do it like they might have on their first album, they found a good balance this time. And they've maintained the theatrical sound, which they've had all along, and I'm glad for that. Brendon Urie could be a huge Broadway star.<br /><br />Overall, I rate this album 4 stars.  It's just not a 5 star album in my opinion, but it's still very good.  You've got to give the band credit, I mean they lost half of their members.  It's not easy to recover from that.  If you're a fan of the band, don't pass this album up.  The standout tracks are tracks:<br /><br />4: Memories<br />5: Trade Mistakes<br />6: Ready to Go (Get Me Out of My Mind)<br />7: Always<br />8: The Calender<br /><br />(Hey that's half the album!!)
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great improvement over original Birds and Seasons and works perfectly on Sprint Epic 4g running FroYo EB13.  Highly recommend.  No problems so far.  really enjoy the interface changes that they introduced.
0765326353|5.0|I listened to this book on audio!  I loved it.  I bought it due to the length of the book and wanted something to occupy me while driving without distracting me.  I went to listening in the car, to listening at night in bed, to carrying my Kindle around the house with the audio on while I did housework and cooking!  I cannot WAIT until the next book is out and hope I live long enough for all TEN!  The next in the series will be a book downloaded on my Kindle so I can read it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I downloaded and installed it on my Droid X without a hiccup. My phone is rooted, so that may be why I haven't had the problems others have had. It works perfectly and a fun version to the reg. game.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just trying to balance out the bad reviews that are bad for no other reason other than amazon releasing the appstore in the US only...    the game is great, works well and should be rated accordingly, rate the game pplz
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is a must download for all android users. it makes it even better when amazon gives it away for free. the graphics have been greatly improved and it doesn't have adds.
B004RLPWXS|4.0|Ever since I got this, I haven't been able to stop listening to three of the tracks in particular.  I've been a Duran fan off and on for years (my favorite was the Wedding Album and, of course, the back '80s catalog) and listening to this took me right back.  The slinky bomp-bomp-bomp bass is there that featured so prominently in so many albums released in the 80s (the early 80s especially), with a layer of electronica laid over some of the tracks that, thankfully, doesn't detract from the richness of the sound.<br /><br />One thing I'll give the guys, here: Simon LeBon admitted once a long while ago that when he would write lyrics for the band in the 80s, he just strung meaningless sentences together because they sounded good (and, boy, can you tell if you actually listen to them).  It seems as though he's made more of an effort to break that habit, this time around, because even though the music is like someone took a ball of silly putty, rubbed it on their albums from the 80s and copied the sound as faithfully as possible, the lyrics have a stronger narrative structure, but all the wonderful dramatic flair and weirdness they did before, without sacrificing any coherency.<br /><br />Three tracks you should listen to before you listen to any of the others: \\"Leave A Light On\\", \\"The Man Who Stole a Leopard\\" and \\"Before the Rain\\" - these tracks are the ones I'm thinking about in particular when I think about the album's strong points (which I've mentioned above).  \\"Before the Rain\\" sounds more like a missing track from \\"The Wedding Album\\", much darker than the other two, more circumspect (to the point of almost sounding bitter), though all three of them generally veer away from the hyperkinetic bounce of the other tracks on the album.  \\"The Man Who Stole a Leopard\\" is just about as perfect a song as you can possibly ask for, especially from these guys, who've had so many perfect singles and album tracks.  The fusion of faithfully-rendered pulsing 80s synths with delicate strains of violin mix works remarkably well.  The lyrics are wonderfully sexy, the story is intriguing, and the fact that they got Kelis (of dubious \\"Milkshake\\" fame) to sing the leopard's answering refrains shows that DD don't feel threatened by the new crop of artists out there.  Seriously, this song is perfect.  \\"Leave A Light On\\" is a lovely blend of guitar and synth, with a chorus that's full of yearning and promise all at the same time.  Another up-side is just how wonderful Simon's voice sounds - as sweet as ever, which makes \\"Leave a Light On\\" (and \\"Leopard\\", too, actually) even better.<br /><br />The rest of the album can't stand up to these three tracks, sadly.  The remaining tracks lament (as many of their songs have from the last few albums -- \\"Too Much Information\\", anyone?) the new celebutainment culture we find ourselves buried up to the neck in these days and the frustration and interference that the convenience of social media and technology can exact as its price (just because you CAN share everything about yourself on the web, does that mean you necessarily SHOULD?), mixed in with a few of the old 'you sexy chicks are so sexy!' songs.  I have to say, though, the conceit of \\"Blame the Machines\\" is a cute idea, cleverly executed.  \\"Girl Panic\\" is one of the few tracks that really comes close to matching the brilliance of \\"...Leopard,\\" \\"Leave a Light On\\" and \\"Before the Rain\\", with fantastic harmonies and music that makes you want to move.  \\"Return to Now\\" is a stand-out instrumental interlude, that I really, REALLY wish had been longer - the recognizable melody borrowed from another song on the album rendered in string-section format is surprisingly beautiful and moving - I dare say, whoever was responsible for arranging that track should think about doing an entire album of Duran songs in such a fashion.  It'd be gorgeous.<br /><br />All in all, the album has its hits and its misses, but take my word on the three songs I mentioned.  Download those and you won't be able to stop listening to them.stop listening to them.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|You let me make all the install-work and account-setting to tell me that the appstore is not available in my region? That really freaks me out! Why can't You tell this in the beginning?

B004KA9MQO|5.0|This is a solid CD release by the talented singer (American Idol and Grammy Award winner) & actress (Oscar winner) Jennifer Hudson, titled 'I Remember Me'. This wonderful CD opens with solid track/gem \\"No One Gonna Love You\\" : great vocals & great lyrics (She sings : I've been through some things). Indeed the past 3 years has been a rollercoster ride for her (gruesome family murder) but things are brightening/looking up and she is feeling good (Idol, Grammy & Oscar winner, birth of her son & losing her weight). Other solid tracks/gems for me include \\"I Got This\\" (great voice, harmonies & wonderful rhythm guitar), \\"Where You At\\" (her great first single written & produced by the great & legendary prolific singer-songwriter Robert Kelly. This song has great vocals & harmonies), \\"I Remember Me\\" (great title track from her poem), \\"Gone\\" (great vocals, melody & harmonies), \\"Still There\\" (great 'ballad' composed by the prolific  & legendary hitmaker Diane Warren. Her vocals are spot-on on this great but voice challenging track)  & \\"Believe\\" (great 'ballad' with inspiring lyrics about her son & her feeling good!). Great tracks include \\"Why Is It So Hard\\", \\"Don't Look Down\\" & \\"Feeling Great\\". Okay/good tracks include \\"Angel\\" & \\"Everybody Needs Love\\". There is no weak track to really talk of from this great CD. On overall, Jennifer Hudson has a real winner in her second album 'I Remember Me' (she feels confident, having fun in this great CD & hopefully her fans will feel well entertained!), a highly recommended CD listening.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works flawlessly on my LG Optimus V (Virgin Mobile, Android 2.2.1/Froyo, 600Mhz, 512MB RAM).    After all the so so / negative reviews I wasn't expecting much from this game on my less-than-cutting edge phone, but was pleasantly surprised.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Advertise as a world wide release and then make it only available to the US.    Sort it out please.

B000KFTWIG|5.0|Biggie Smalls aka Frank White aka Chris Wallace is deservedly remembered as one of the greatest MC's of his time. He had flow, he had rhymes but what strikes a cord with me the most is Wallace's storytelling abilities. He told stories with grit, anger and confusion and you always felt like you were right there witnessing everything he was rhyming about. The first time I heard \\"Suicidal Thoughts\\", I couldn't sleep for a whole night. It was crazy. This album(along with Enter The 36 Chambers, Illmatic, The Infamous and Reasonable Doubt) saved the East Coast from falling off and gave it some commercial appeal. What is also amazing is that even though Biggie was commercially successful he never sacrificed any substance. He had pop songs(One More Chance), personal songs(Juicy) and street songs(Things Done Changed). Hip-Hop fans from both sides had no choice but to respect him. Alot of wack rappers today study this album and try to mimic it but none have succeeded. Bottom line if you like hip-hop than you need to cop this if you haven't already...Now!

B004SBS8LA|1.0|The introduction of the Amazon App Store was supposed to show us a higher level of quality control compared to the Android Market.  That had not been the case and it is extremely disappointing.  Not only did I have to jump through a dozen different links to download the app store app but I have not come across one app that has worked on my Droid X.  This app downloads just fine but it refuses to install.  In fact, every app on this store has done this with my phone.  Amazon and Rovio have both dropped the ball by releasing such buggy experiences.
0307595579|5.0|I looked at \\"regular\\" book stores online and retail and found these to be the least expensive. I found them as high as almost $70.00 elsewhere. My husband wanted these to read and he enjoyed all the books.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is a big step up from the original Angry Birds or Angry Birds Seasons. The graphics are much more crisp and colorful. Gameplay is smooth. This game is great for hours of fun!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Terrible customer service Amazon, to not only advertise its available but to allow you to download the app only to find out not available outside the USA! Very poor Amazon and very poor Rovio for allowing yourselves to be limited to one market.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I just watched this and can't really add anything to what others have said.  However, I would like to encourage listening to the commentary.<br /><br />The director does a fabulous job of adding details to his character development, decor and costumes, location, etc info...it really added depth to all involved with the series and this movie.  His love of it comes through beautifully.
B00005NKKV|5.0|This was the defining American album of the mid 1960's. It was a time when England was calling all the shots in music, Motown was not yet a real force, and most of the alternatives to the British Invasion were Roy Orbison, Neil Sedaka and the Righteous Brothers. Simon and Garfunkel spoke directly to the loneliness of the soul that was pre-Woodstock adolescence, and the rejection of the men in their gray flannel suits who were propelling us to be things we did not want to be anymore. Perhaps this is why Simon and Garfunkel were so despised by the adults of the time.   This was the innocent and poetic Paul Simon before he studied music formally, and they sucked out his living soul and left him the insipid husk that would write trash like \\"Call Me Al\\" and \\"Slip-Slidin' Away\\".   Art Garfunkel has the voice of an angel, and apparently the heart of one too. His brief foray into acting (Catch 22, Carnal Knowledge) soon turned him to pursue a deeper and more meaningful life than his shallow and egotistical partner, as he dedicated himself to helping children.  Simon and Garfunkel would bless the world shortly after this album with the lively and deceptively deep soundtrack to The Graduate and propel the acting career of a virtual unknown named Dustin Hoffman.  But in 1965 and '66, we felt a chill autumn wind blowing across us as our older classmates graduated and were drafted and went to a frightening and forbidding place called Vietnam, where they were offered as blood sacrifices to the political ambitions of the greedy, hound-faced President Lyndon Johnson. And we truly felt the Sounds of Silence.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Plays great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab, sounds and graphics look really good and the controls are easy to use. Comes out of the Myst genre, you have to get items and solve puzzles as you go. Not sure how much I've solved, haven't figured out the globe, clock, falcons, and secret hallway. Have to keep at it, curiosity makes me want to solve this.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Well done awesome game! And at least we know when to expect updates for game! Hope original conts to be updated as well! Must get app
B0007TKNII|3.0|Within the first minutes of viewing this film, I realized it would be better and worse than the stage production.  On the positive side, the camera allows the audience to see the characters from different angles, and up-close.  As a film production, it's rather marvelous.  The choice for the lead singers is open for debate.  Though Gerard Butler strained to produce the Phantom's songs, he did possess a strong on-screen presence.  Emma Rosum was a big gamble by the producers.  The songs of Christine had to be modified to fit Rosum's vocal range.  The compensatory factor is Rosum's sparkling image before the camera, as well as her adept acting ability.  Like Butler, she strains to reach the highs and lows vocally, yet the more narrow and girlish range produces a feeling of sweetness and vulnerability. Overall, I enjoyed the film, as well as the performers.  I've watched Sarah Brightman filmed doing a couple of songs, as directed by Ken Russell via YouTube, and she is quite good.  Brightman looks half her age and (I believe) possess convincing acting ability.  Her voice is of such a different caliber that you simply cannot make any comparisons.  As much as I was enchanted by Rosum, I do think Brightman should have been cast as Christine.  I think the end result would have packed a lot more punch.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I got this on audio which was really interesting.  I hate it when you can tell that there are the same 4 characters pretending to be different characters just by making their voice sound a bit different.  That started to drive me crazy!  Anyway,the story was good until the boy escaped, then the story was kind of going in circles with no point.
B004SBULWE|3.0|This application was excellent before the advent of Android 2.2 software.  Android 2.2 added memory management features not included in previous versions of the operating system.  These new features allow the Android operating system to automatically allocate memory upon use, and also disable background CPU cycles unless the application is flagged specifically to run in the background (stopwatches, timers, news-feeds).<br /><br />Android 2.1 and earlier NEED THIS PROGRAM.  The memory management, and task management of these early versions left much to be desired.  Applications that were in the background could still consume CPU cycles and detain blocks of memory.  That memory was unavailable to any other application, or even the the operating system itself.  This application fixes those issues.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />If you have Android 2.2 or later, you do NOT need this program.<br />-<br />If you have Android 2.1 or earlier you NEED THIS program.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love angry birds Rio great improvments and graphics are awesome. I can't wait for more levels to open up. thanks for another great game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds returns in a wacky adventure to rio in brazil. The game is as fun as ever and now I think it's even better. The graphics are more pleasing and sleek. A new twist has been added where you now free your bird friends instead of going after the pigs. Download this now my android friends.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this app! I really don't understand the use of the 25 words minimum on these reviews though. I don't want to write a novel!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I purchased Pride and Prejudice on vhs years ago for A LOT of money.  I would still watch it from time to time but was so excited to see it restored on dvd (for much cheaper!)  The picture quality is great, and still the best retelling of this story, it has Colin Firth!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|one of the great apps on Android<br /><br />glad to see its here on Amazon<br /><br />(25 word minimum sucks! blah.. blah.. blah.. useless crap... c'mon amazon! this is lame!)
B004SBULWE|1.0|Use watchdog instead to keep track of misbehaving apps. This (advanced task killer) will use more battery than it saves cuz apps will reload in the background, defeating the purpose. Background apps don't use processor power unless they are in use. Android does this on its own. Android also will automatically kill unused apps to free up memory when you need
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I think the reviews speak for themselves! Sort it out Amazon, are you telling me your mailing list isn't sorted in to location. I feel duped :-( UK
B000UVT3OI|4.0|I was very impressed with this CD collection.  I had always been disappointed that Garth Brooks's music was not available on iTunes, but I did not know of a way to get it without spending money on a number of different CDs.  This collection was just the answer.  Thanks to a gift credit, I paid only five dollars including shipping.  Now I have all my Garth Brooks Favorites in one place.  I would definitely recommend this to any Garth Brooks fan.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this one pwns I like it wah better than the free versions with ads. go for it! lame that Amazon has a 25 word minimum
B004SBS8LA|5.0|its awesome! sound and graphics are good. had no trouble with it all in all a good game and addicting so enjoy it to the fullest
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Go through the paces - givbe up my email - then forced to sign in on account - download the app - launch the app - into plays- I select first level - app reverts back to the app store...what is this a beta? do they think this crap will entice me to buy apps from them???  With this I'm tempted to not buy books from them.  I abhor being played for a fool!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|improved visuals over prior 2 A.B. games.  loads and exits extremely fast on my Droid 2.  a little too easy at least thru level 3-7.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|No problem installing this on my moto atrix that is on at&t.  Not sure what the problem is with other people and at&t.  I like that I could get this free to see now the new amazon app store works.  I am very excited to know that the app store is now something easy to use and no need for paypal.  Thank you Amazon.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|It's hard to imagine that such a simple game concept could be so addictive, but this game pulls it off much like Angry Birds does. Have had no problems at all running it on my phone. At 99 cents, it's a steal. Get it! Evo 4G.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've been an Angry Birds fan since they started on iPhone. This is the best YET! I absolutely love RIO! It's freakin awesome. MUST OWN!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Plays well with nice graphics. The app is worth downloading. It has the same angry birds play mechanics you know and love. This time around you are rescuing kidnapped birds.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am thrilled with this Bible app. I am using its incorporated audio to listen to my reading plan as I ready myself for work each day. Thank you! Thank you!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|not only do you need an account, be in the US and not on at&t but you also have to turn on one click ordering with a credit card bound to it. no thanks. appstore ripoff fail.    Update:The Amazon Appstore makes the Android Market completely unusable on my Verizon Moto Xoom. I do not think I will be using Amazon for my app purchases.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Android app by YouVersion has to be one of the best Android Apps out there.  Not only are offerings of written and audio Scripture great, but the user interface is super sleek and worth a look by other app creators.  And the fact that the interface is localized and available in more than 10 languages is a great bonus!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|can not download due to pricechange, Amazon, too bad ruining rio launch. hopefully still free when issue is fixed. in all fairness it should in my opinion. written to amazon support, but no word yet.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds is one of the best mobile games ever and this boost the companies fame even higher with this one love this game have fun!!!!
0307477479|5.0|I greatly enjoyed \\"A Visit From the Goon Squad.\\" The interlocking stories that form the narrative are expertly plotted, and turning the page to the next chapter always produces a surprise, as you can't predict which character will next take his or her position as the center of attention.  For the most part these are tales of the cities (New York, Los Angeles), but Egan's fine eye for detail is equally good in side trips to places like Naples, Westchester, or Palm Springs. This is a book you can curl up with in order to shudder sympathetically at the unstoppable depredations of \\"the goon\\" (time).<br /><br />I did find the end of the book a bit disappointing in its turn toward a future dystopia in which everyone, even children, reserves eye contact for handheld electronic devices rather than other human beings. The PowerPoint \\"diary\\" chapter (ironically, it does not come out well on a Kindle) is likewise interesting but not compelling. This stuff is in no way as complicated as the human relationships in the rest of the book---and perhaps that's the point--but the power of Egan's stories seems to dissipate here. Don't let this criticism put you off the novel; it is well worth reading.<br /><br />M. Feldman
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Lisa Gardner rocks the reading world. First time reader of Lisa Gardner and I absolutely loved the book. She takes your mind way beyond simply reading a very good book. Lisa Gardner, assists you in being a part of the book and gives real purpose to the characters she writes about. Lisa makes you feel as though you are in the book, as a character all your own. Great, Great read!! Kindle lovers have most definitely got to load this book. No doubt, you won't be putting it down. I have recently downloaded \\"The Perfect Husband\\" and \\"Love You More\\". I cannot wait to begin reading \\"The Perfect Husband\\". Thank you Lisa Gardner for giving me the desire to be an ongoing avid reader. I look forward to reading more of Lisa Gardner's books. Keep \\"em\\" coming Lisa! :)
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Awesome accessory for under $10! We keep bottled drinks, snacks, pacifiers, etc... in there easily. There's also a zippered pocket to put money in. We don't have to take it off and on when folding the stroller up. It stays upright when the handle is at a 45 degree angle :-) Highly recommend this for the UppaBaby Vista, esp bc their cup holder is expensive and worthless.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The download took forever but once installed it worked great on my EVO 4G. Game graphics are great and so far the game is just as fun to play as Angry Birds & Seasons, but better graphics and interface.
B003A3K3JW|5.0|How many versions of Strawinsky's Sacre should I have, when one is a historical recording directed by Strawinsky himself and one directed by Giergiev that is as imposing as the Allied bombardments on Lybian tanks. A recording of the underrated Residentie Orchestra of the Hague with the acoustics of a small theater to prove that also an intimate version is possible. How glad I am that I added Dudamels version to my collection. His version with the Bolivar Youth Orchestra succeeds in giving you the feeling that this is the first time you hear this music. I have seen Dudamel direct his Gothenborg Symphony and the Concertgebouw Orchestra, so I could observe how he \\"handles\\" the orchestra. Firstly he masters the basics of beat and rythm as accurate as von Karajan and secondly he seems to pull the sound out of the orchestra. I am not saying that this is the only right way (f.i. Mariss Jansons gives orchestras room to breathe freely with amazing results), but especially in the case of the Sacre the result is overwhelming. My sons are no great classical music fans, let alone 20th century classical music, but this Sacre had a big Wow effect on them. As a bonus I discovered the composer Revueltas. So you probably have a Sacre in your collection, don't hesitate to add this one.
B004DMIIOG|4.0|Great animation and sound, touching story and a good amount of action, Summer Wars is a fun movie to watch and very emotional towards the end. The plot itself isnt so original and a little, or more cliché, Its still a fun movie to watch and the characters believable and impressively passionate , which is different than what i tend to watch like bleach which is just fighting. Anyways great Animation, Awesome soundtrack, and characters you actually grow on, and at 20 bucks, lets you show off how good bluray can look for Anime. Great Purchase.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better than the other versions. Graphics and background are great. Best part of all is that it was free. Can't wait to see the movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Install of the game - and the Amazon Appstore - went smoothly and without a hitch on my Evo. Understand not everyone had that experience but things couldn't have been easier far as I'm concerned.    The gameplay itself was a pleasant surprise. I expected more of the usual Angry Birds scheme and theme; not so. Well done Rovio and Amazon!
B004RLPWXS|1.0|It doesn't matter how you dress a pig... it's still a pig.  And likewise with most of Duran's music in the last 20 years.  It doesn't matter what sound they go for - rock, techno, pop - they just can't come up with any actual TUNES.  It's sad, really.  These guys peaked in their 20s, apparently.<br /><br />This album tries, tries, tries to create energy, but there isn't a memorable melody or hook on here. And songs like Other People's Lives are just embarrassing.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This \\"Persuasion\\" is the standard by which all other adaptations of britlit should be judged. Amanda Root is flawless as the faded and resigned Anne who has already accepted her fate as spinster aunt and put-upon companion to her uncaring family. Ciaran Hinds wonderfully brings to life Captain Wentworth who made his fortune during the Napoleonic sea battles and is now ready to settle down. They are both tragic victims of the standards of the time,  separated while in their early twenties by class consciousness and lack of money (his). But the Fates have destined that they meet again years later and despite the wounded pride of the Captain, and Anne's fragile feelings that threaten to overcome her at a moment's notice, they do find each other once more.    This is a movie about hidden passions: about Anne's repressed and fragile feelings, and about Frederick's channeled passions and wounded pride which have become duty to king and country.  Jane Austen's brilliance lay in using words to imply the bubbling cauldron of emotions beneath the surface of good manners and this movie shows these passions in a rapid glance, a trembling hand on a chair, a guarded comment. But beneath the happy story is the sadness we feel when we realize that fictional Anne is just one of thousands of real young women who had been destined to remain spinsters at home, burdens to be tolerated but not loved. Anne is lucky and we know it.    The mastery of this film (including its acting, costumes, lighting, direction, and even its slow pace) is seeing ghostly Anne change from a pale shadow that haunts her family home, wearing washed out colors, going through her days unloved and unwanted, to a young woman who literally wakes up to life and love, a bloom in her cheeks as she herself blossoms into the passionate woman she always has been under her sadness. She alone of her family is deserving of this monumental and deep love and we are happy for her.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This game still has legs. Some find it to be passe, but I still enjoy playing. Rovio keeps adding excitement to the storyline. Not having seen the movie, I assume they have kept a foot in the movie's story while still telling the Angry Birds tale.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|c'mon. it's twitter. if you don't use it, you don't want it. if you do, you gotta have it. hopeful for a tablet optimized version in the future -- the ipad variant is really slick.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|You announce worldwide release then make it US only.. Bet it becomes available worldwide once it drops off the free app of the day... What a joke!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The app downloaded fine and the game is great! Great graphics, no ads, and it is quick! I think the title for my review says it all!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The graphics have been upgraded heavily and Rovio has managed to keep the gameplay fresh... Kudos! I would recommend this game to any and everyone :-)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better: game play, graphics, puzzles. Wow!k Thanks Amazon. Remember to enable &quot;one-click&quot; and link a payment type, even for the Free stuff. Amazon won't charge you. Can't wait to see what else Amazon offers for Android. Samsung Vibrant, Axura froyo rom ver 2.3
B000ZECQ08|2.0|While some parts I liked, the movie seemed like a step back in the series, there was less continuity. In the movie universe, when the hell did Harry started noticing Ginny, in the books, they gave somewhat closure to the Cho crush, but they didn't show that in the previous film. The other thing is, what happened to the battle, the producers said that they cut it out to prevent repetiveness. That was what some people wanted to see, for me it would have been a taste for whats to come in the final hogwarts battle. Lastly, I got large helping of teen angst, I get that they are teenagers, but if I wanted to see that, I would have watched the CW. Thankfully they made up for it in the Deathly Hallows.
B004FGMV0W|4.0|Since launching her career almost a decade ago, her fans have come to know Avril Lavigne as colorful punk princess. And, it has only been on a few rare occasions (like the songs \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Slipped Away\\") in which we've had the chance to see another side to the pop superstar.<br />On \\"Goodbye Lullaby,\\" Lavigne's fourth studio album, she presents a slightly different energy. Although there are still the pop-punk sounds that have been the staples of her CDs, she also showcases a different, more mature sound. Essentially, Lavigne shows a little more in terms of her softer side while somehow still maintaining the rock vibe she has become synonymous with.<br />Probably the best tracks on \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" include:<br />\\"What The Hell\\"<br />\\"Smile\\"<br />\\"Push\\"<br />\\"Not Enough\\"<br />\\"Darlin\\"<br /><br />My least favorite tracks would have to be:<br />\\"Wish You Where Here\\"<br />\\"Stop Standing There\\"<br />\\"I Love You\\"<br /><br />All in all, Lavigne should have yet another hit on her hands with \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" as she continues to grow as an artist and entertainer.
B00005AYET|3.0|One has to be a Roman Polanski fan to make this film really work - to be motivated to dig deep for meaning, etc. If not then it's simply a great video to watch on a rainy day in the absence of anything else.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|You slice fruit.  Then you slice more fruit and build combo scores when you slice multiple fruit (or is it fruits??).  Gets old quick.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Come on, this is absolutely the most awaited game ever, and put dumb region restrictions? Rovio, you really really really lost a fan, a customer, I was about to pay both Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons as well, to support you and your wonderful games, but, this idea of simply making a game exclusive of an APP STORE that sells only to the USA. LAME, is the only thing I can think off. It is really a shame.
B004H0N4PM|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Elbow. All of their albums have a unique flavor to them, while still sticking to their overarching style. Build A Rocket Boys! certainly does not disappoint in the slightest bit. It's a great follow-up to 2008's near-perfect The Seldom Seen Kid (my favorite Elbow album.) My only gripe with it is that it slows down about halfway through the album and never picks up the pace again. Open Arms begins to break out of the slow pace, but the second half still begins to feel like a Guy Garvey solo album rather than Elbow. And \\"The Birds (Reprise)\\" was just a bit throwing the theme over the top, having an old man sing it, reflecting on his time at home. But if that's your thing....    Lyrically, it's another masterpiece. I think some of the greatest lyrics ever by Garvey and some of the greatest lyrics ever period. Really the lyrics are what brings this album into the upper echelon of music.    I'd really give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars, and that's just comparing it to Elbow's other work. If this were to go against the pop music of today it would be an 11 out of 5 stars. I'm sure I'll be listening forever.    UPDATE: After listening to this multiple more times, it has grown on me and I am increasing it's score to a 5 out of 5. Still not the biggest fan of \\"The Birds (Reprise)\\" but it's the only lacking track on the album, and the rest is pure musical and lyrical genius. A great-follow up to their last success. Every album has it's own flavor, and this one's just took a little getting used to.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I live in a populated area when it comes to wifi networks, seems like everyone around me has one. The issue was however I never took the time to look at channel conflicts. Well firing this app up immediately shows you what channel networks around you are on in a great graphical way, shows signal strength, etc. It's a great, free tool! I changed my network to the channel with the least usage and my network say some improvement. I would imagine having 5 networks all on the same channel around me wasn't helping. Great little app.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|After a 10 minute registration process Amazon App Store informs me that the Project Manager for Amazon Appstore forgot there is a world outside US. Not ever returning again.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I downloaded Angry Birds Rio apk file from other source cause they r not available outside USA =(<br />To restrict access to a product increases piracy of them. Think about that.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|much more than an embedded mobile web page, makes eBaying on the move simple.  notifications very useful to avoid missing end of auctions!  would download again, a++++++ ;)
B004GYY714|5.0|this app allows you to listen to almost all radio staions across the usa.  great quality hardly no buffer and just overall great app.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|search, buy.  that's all it does and that's all it needs to do. DRM free music at Amazon prices, other online music vendors could do well to take note...
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is a very cool app if you have ever been out shopping or dining and wondered what song was playing over the store's speakers.  You click the button, it samples the music for a few seconds, and then sends the sample to the cloud for identification.  Within a minute it reports back the song title, artist name, album name, and genre.  It also provides a bunch of links such as: buy the song at AmazonMP3, view tour dates, watch the video on YouTube, view the lyrics, post to Facebook/Twitter, etc.  It even provides a list of recommended songs based on the one you just identified (tagged).  Very slick app that works surprisingly well.  I recommend it!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I'd love to give this a review but because I'M IN THE UK I can't. Sort it out Amazon. Then I'll rerate it accordingly. This could have been a great release but as usual the greedy pigs (pun intended) have to ruin the party.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|They're only angry because they can't fly. Our lovely birds are envious of other real birds with wings. These birds develop an overlay exaggerated sling shot to launch themselves. An attempt to show superiority and faith to their deity, the Mighty Eagle. Of course with honourable suicide comes great reward; each bird, after death, is granted their wings with the exception of one. The green bird will take 5 more flying lessons before redemption.  The game is the same old angry birds with souper powered graphics. Why are you reading this when you should wasting your time playing Angry Birds!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So I downloaded this game and it is a nice twist to the Angry Birds plot...also, you can not argue with free (assuming you get it in time)!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Sad it is a amazon exclusive for the android and avilable only in the US. There are a lot of fans of Angry Birds that would like to play the game.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazona appstore keeps saying the price has been changed, so it will not allow me to install it....  I've tried to restart my phone, no good. So much for a quality appstore.
0439023521|5.0|I read this novel a few months ago at the recommendation of several friends.  Reading the publisher's review of the book had me thinking that the dark premise and youth of the book was just so not my style.  I conceded after the 5th person raved over it.  It's a cheap read, so ok, why not?  Once I got 20 pages in, I was soooo hooked.  I couldn't stop.  I had to see where it was going, and I cringed many times during the darker parts, but they kept me reading.  You come to love the characters very early on, and you read and read to cheer them on, see what happens next.  Most of this book is set in a world that the darkest post apocalyptic movie could not come close to making a vivid reality in your brain.  But read on, you must.  I read the whole series in 5 days.  You won't put this read down.  It moves quickly, and, thankfully, the whole series is available for e readers in a click.  If you hesitate that this book and series is not your thing, try the first book, and prepare to buy the rest.  Happy reading.
0694003611|1.0|We were given this books as a gift. I really dislike it--there seems to be an upleasant undertone: \\"bowl full of mush\\", \\"goodnight nobody\\". I find the illustrations equally unpleasant (or maybe that's why I find the book unpleasant). I recycled it.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I'm one of Joe's biggest fans and think he is one of the best guitar players around. I was not real happy with his last CD Blackrock, but this one was worth the wait. He's back to his blues roots and has never sounded better. His voice and playing are awesome. A must buy CD for all of his fans.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Hey geniuses that are giving one star because you can't install - you have to set your phone to allow apps from Unknown Sources.  The directions when you purchase the game specifically say this!!    This is a phenomenal game, another Angry Birds triumph!
B004L49K20|4.0|I'd actually go to 4 1/2 stars if this would let me.  From beginning to end, this is easily the best Duran Duran album since 1988's Big Thing (and to many, it may go further back than that - I was always quite partial to Big Thing).  I know most people know the story of Mark Ronson being a long time Duran Duran fan and wanting to make the imaginary follow-up to Rio, so I'll skip that and get into the album itself.    First single and title track \\"All You Need Is Now\\" almost sounds like two completely different songs.  The verses have an electro-whirring almost industrial sound that makes you wonder on first listen what the hell is going on...until the song reaches it's \\"New Moon On Monday\\"-ish chorus.  This is the first point on the CD that you realize that \\"yeah, they've still got it\\".  After a few listens though, the entire track rather seemlessly melds together into a tune you'll have a hard time getting out of your head.    \\"Blame The Machines\\" and \\"Being Followed\\" both sound like they could have been at home on the band's first album (with \\"Being Followed\\" - which sounds like an offspring of \\"Careless Memories\\" being the stronger of the two in my opinion).  Next up is the son of \\"Save a Prayer\\" called \\"Leave A Light On\\".  It's the one song on the original 9-track download release that sounds somewhat forced and calculated - and, not surprisingly, my candidate for weakest song on the original download.    After that minor hiccup, the far more interesting second half of the CD starts up with an appearance from Ana Matronic of the Scissor Sisters on \\"Safe (In The Heat of the Moment)\\".  It's a throwback funk disco number complete with cowbells - yes, cowbells - and slap bass where Simon's more animated vocal juxtaposes well with the cool come on's from Ana.    \\"Girl Panic!\\" is next and if this doesn't deserve to be a radio staple this Spring, I don't know what does.  Take one part \\"Girls on Film\\", one part \\"Planet Earth\\", one part \\"Rio\\" and the best pop vocal Simonhas laid down in years and you get this highly uptempo dance floor gem that I can't wait to hear live.    \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\" is next and do yourself a favor - just listen to it.  There's a reason why people are raving about this one.  Yes, it has a very \\"The Chauffeur\\" feel to it.  Yes, it has (a surprisingly restrained) Kelis singing with Simon.  It's also incredibly unique and even clocking in at over six minutes, it's hands down the best song on the album.    Rounding out the album are the \\"Last Chance on the Stairway\\"-ish \\"Runway Runaway\\" (and it's kick ass chorus) and moody closer \\"Before the Rain\\".    Alas, this release has been expanded from the original download version released in December.  Having just gotten the expanded release today, these are my initial impressions of the added tracks.  \\"A Diamond In The Mind\\" and \\"Return to Now\\" are a pair of orchestral interludes (much in the vein of \\"Interlude One\\" and \\"Flute Interlude\\" on Big Thing).  \\"Too Bad You're So Beautiful\\" is the best of the added tracks with it's uptempo groove.  \\"Mediterranea\\" is a slow mover which to me is going to be that song that ultimately grows on you with repeated listens.  \\"Other People's Lives\\" is D2 going political (passable but not memorable) and \\"Networker Nation\\" borders on filler.  Additionally, the limited release available at Best Buy adds two more songs to the release - \\"Too Close To The Sun\\" (filler) and \\"Early Summer Nerves\\" (a midtempo track with a sneaky catchy quality to it).    In summary, the boys are back.  Sure, they're paying homage...but it's to their own storied past.  With noticable influences of some of the best songs they wrote back in the 80's, Duran Duran have made a record capable of being placed alongside their best work.  After a few decades wandering around with hits and misses and with a little prodding from a producer that gave them the push they needed, Duran Duran are finally back in the territory they helped to create...and doing it better than anyone had a right to expect.

You have to like these kind of low budget fighting movies to even consider reading this review, so i won't give you the \\"no Oscar awards here\\" speech. If you're looking for some class act fighting, rent this, or buy it. Adkins looks like he weighs well over 200 pounds, but has the kind of gymnastic skills that keep him flying through the air for that perfect punch. I will definitely be checking out more of this guy's movies.

B004LSJCJM|3.0|While this album may be going back to the style many fans of the great Joe Bonamassa prefer, the quality of the songs isn't there. Some great playing, great singing, but not great songs. The last two albums were better in terms of quality. I loved them but also love his more \\"blues\\" stuff. His last couple of album showed some creative growth. This album is very generic. It packs no punch, just drones on and on. The only standouts are the title track and Black Lung Heartache, which most certainly does pack a punch! Great song. While I consider this a disappointing album for Joe, it's still better than most stuff out there.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I wondered why it wouldn't install and then I noticed that it was a security setting on my Epic 4G. I assume it may be the same on other phones. Basically, there is a setting that only allows signed apps to be installed and since this one wasn't, I couldn't download. After making a quick change I was able to run and the quality is top notch.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I just received my headset and all I can say is WOW! At first I was scared because of all the reviews on it saying there was popping and cracking noise. At first when I turned it on I did head a pop and some crackling, but after that I didn't hear it anymore and I am in love with it. The sound is so incredible you have to hear it for yourself, it actually sounds like your in a little room with surround sound speakers all around you. That being said I give this product an A+++    Pros: EVERYTHING!    Cons: Battery life    Recommendations: Get yourself some rechargeable batteries like I did.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So, as many of the other users on here have stated, I was pretty upset when Angry Birds Rio wouldn't install to my SD card or without my SD card, but after some searching I found a solution. Link your phone to your PC and delete the \\"smdl2tmp1.asec\\" file in the \\".android_secure\\" folder. Then just eject your phone and try to install it again. It worked like a charm after months of SD card issues. Have fun.

1439177783|3.0|First off, I am glad Ms. de Rossi finally came out about her eating disorder. It takes one to know one and I (personally) was aware Ms. de Rossi was in hiding about her eating disorder before Entertainment Tonight or People Magazine listed photos of the skinny girls on the cast of Ally McBeal back in the `90's. I say this because if you have had an eating disorder you are aware of obsessive viewing of magazine and media of skinny people (I am being brutally honest here.)  I was very proud of Ms. de Rossi for coming out in regards to her sexual orientation several years back in the media, yet I felt she was being dishonest because she would not be up front about her past anorexia. In these cases, and especially if you are a celebrity, I feel it important to be completely honest. So again, I was extremely relieved and excited to read this book. In regards to her book, I very much appreciate her brutal honesty. Yet I do tend to agree with other reviews and am concerned that it can potentially be a self help book for how to become anorexic. My problem is that the meat of the book is about her neurotic eating. It is difficult to read, and on one hand I do appreciate the honesty because if you have not lived it, you have no idea what it is like. But on the other hand why did she not share more about her experience in recovery? A sequel in store perhaps?  To sum, I would say this is a good read as there are very few memoirs on eating disorders. But if you want to read an outstanding and scary and moving memoir that will literally save lives, I would recommend: \\"Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia,\\" by Marya Hornbacher. And lastly, as a final comment, I am a bit concerned with Ms. de Rossi's comments in the epilogue about being vegan. She stated that she is at peace with eating because she no longer deprives herself of food and therefore is not worried about a relapse. But isn't a vegan diet--literally a diet, deprivation if animal protein and milk products not allowedto be consumed?? I am posing the question as a concern--that Ms. de Rossi perhaps has not yet fully recovered and uses the vegan diet as means of control?

Make a free radiotime account and you can manage your bookmarks from the computer as well, and share the list of stations between devices/computers.     Huge list of stations.

0817439390|4.0|Bryan Peterson's Understand Exposure is an outstanding introductory text for new photographers and along with Scott Kelby's Digital Photography 3 volume book set was my beginning point to learning my new hobby.  With literally hundreds of books to choose from, I think you would be hard-pressed to find a better book to help you conquer one's fear of unlocking the potential of your camera and getting away from shooting in the Program mode.    Bryan outlines the 3 components that go into making up an exposure(picture):  Aperture, shutter speed and ISO.  He relates how you can pair aperture and shutter speed to get a properly exposed picture and then addresses both aperture and shutter speed in detail to explain how to obtain the \\"creative\\" exposure you are looking to achieve, often with comparison photos to demonstrate his points.  This is the strength of the book and made the purchase worthwhile, it's also the reason for my 5-star rating.    Great photos are seen throughout the book with focal lengths, f/stops and shutter speeds listed along w/ the captions for each photo.     He briefly covers different types of continuous lighting, his techniques to help get an exposure: The Sky Brothers and Mr. Green Jeans and rounds the book out with a brief description of filters, flash & HDR.    The only question I have, after viewing the Table of Contents for Bryan's Understanding Photography Field Guide, the same material seems to be included, although the accompanying photos may not, I am left with the question of whether I may have better off having purchased that book instead.  Needless to say, his Field Guide is on my list of purchases to make, and will try to update this after taking possession of it and Digital Exposure Handbook by Ross Hoddinott, which is currently on order.    Update: Ross Hoddinott's Digital Exposure Handbook has a little more information and is equally as good at explaining and demonstrating the keys to exposure as Understanding Exposure.  I still plan on purchasing Bryan's Field Guide, which I have a feeling makes Understanding Exposure unnecessary.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Use it all the time - way better than itunes in my opinion - fantastic deals of the day - must say with my evo 4g I rarely open my laptop anymore
B004SBS8LA|5.0|two thumbs up, rovio. love angry birds as always. i find the changes in the game very refreshing! it runs and looks great on my droid x. cant wait for the updates.. beat it already.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The Amazon Appstore is something I have been waiting for on Android for some time.  Angry Birds Rio is an excellent followup to previous titles, and has better graphics than previous versions.  Looks stellar on Galaxy Tab and Galaxy S.    If ATT Wireless doesnt support Amazon Appstore, boo hoo.  Seems like a good reason to switch carriers to one that gives you freedom of choice (cough, Sprint, cough) or at least call ATT management to complain.  Its their choice not Amazons.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Just as I expected, extremely pleased.    I'd rather not spoil it.  If you haven't seen it - see it!  If you don't like the Saw movies, don't start with this one - work your way up.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Absolutely love these songs.  Brings back memories from the past dancing salsa at the clubs around the areas in Chicago, IL.  Santana was the guy to listen to everyday.
B0002V7O3S|5.0|The movie is based on a true story, but it is told from Hollywood's point of view. will watching it make anyone believe in ufos and aliens? In my own words, no. its a movie is simply about an alien abduction and a group of friends prooving thier innocent of killing the abductee. The last fifteen min of the film will keep you on the edge of your seat and probly not meant to watch alone or in the dark. Its a good film and one of my favs.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is just like your old angry birds but they've iimproved it on some points. It is now very smooth, compared to my experience with the original games, and the physics seem to be much more realistic than the others. Very satisfied with this game, especially because it was free. Hoping they release more good paid apps for free and not some crap that nobody wants.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It isn't the same as regular angry birds, that is just part of it.  But for the truly obsessed angry birds lover, this is a great app to add to the angry bird library!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Works perfect on Evo 4G. Nice graphics, had no problem downloading and installing, for people having problems installing get \\"ASTRO\\" file browser and go to the downloads folder the installer will be in there.
0375413405|5.0|I am going to make this review short. The book is amazingly well written, only problem is 'LACK of photos'.    For many of us who are used to visual presentation of each step, this book can be little challenging as most steps are explained in words.

B000001FA4|5.0|I listened to this album too many times as a young person to be objective.  I remember the first time I heard the opening guitar/drum lines of \\"Pride\\" on the car radio.  It sent chills up my 9 year old arms.<br /><br />I grew up to be a musician and producer heavily influenced by U2/Eno/Lanios.  This album stands up to the test of time on many levels.  I have only a few things to add that may not be known:<br /><br />1. Technically speaking, the soundstage of this record is very unusual: thick, layered and warm for albums of this era.  In fact, Eno's entire mix is not only a unique contrast to the \\"bright, excited\\" sound typical of 83/84, it is unique to ANY album I've ever heard.  This is 100% intentional on Eno's part. Listen to this on a good set of monitors and it will engulf you.<br /><br />2. Larry Mullen recorded several final drum tracks with loud and live monitors in the drum room, which bled into the tracks and perhaps lend an amount of bleed and tonal characteristics of amplification.<br /><br />3. The Edge has stated that this is the album that he feels stands up best over time, and he still enjoys listening to it.<br /><br />A classic.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|really good game i love it. it has really improved from previous angry birds.. the visuals are really good. the 3d effect is awesome! now they should upgrade the original and seasons...
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|This is not such a bad movie if you have pretty low expectations.  It is<br />entertaining, funny at times, and suspenseful.

142311339X|5.0|I really enjoy Rick Riordan's writing style.  And this may actually be my most favorite of his of all that I have read.  If you enjoyed Percy Jackson you will love this, since it is kind of a continuation of the tale with new unknown characters.  I love that his books are fun and easy to read, and of course that there is humor oozing out of every page . . . . who doesn't like laughing?  I mean come on. His characters are likeable and quick-witted.  Like the rating shows- 5 stars!!!
B004JN1D2I|1.0|This is a review NOT based on content but on format. Like others I bought this to re-read prior to A Dance With Dragons.  I love these books and 5 stars isn't enough to rate the story itself.  However...    The Kindle progress meter shows your progress across ALL 4 books while you read; each book being approx 1000 pages means you're tracking against roughly 4000 pages rather than against the book you're reading.  Without an advanced math degree it's nearly impossible to quickly determine where you are in any one volume. On the PC and iPad version, there is a TOC with jump points to each volume/chapter but the progress bar is disheartening.  I keep a paperback copy next to my bed for visual reference to keep me grounded.    I have to admit that I got lucky on the price.  I pre-ordered when it was 1/2 off; $17.99 for all 4 was a great deal.  There is ZERO advantage to buying this while it costs the same as buying each book independently.  Each one will take you several weeks to a month to read.  Buy each subsequent volume as you finish the previous.  Who knows, you might catch them on sale.
0439023521|4.0|Let's say it up front: a writer of Suzanne Collins's calibre ought to know the difference between \\"lay\\" and \\"lie\\". The repeated misuse of \\"lay\\" for \\"lie\\" continually jerked me out of an otherwise completely gripping narrative. (As did \\"compliment\\" for \\"complement\\", but that only happened once.)    The novel is a textbook for writers in how to raise the stakes. It's impossible to put down-- even in the quiet parts.    I do agree with other reviewers that this dystopian society isn't logically feasible. To me the thing that rang most false was the schooling. In societies where people constantly wonder where their next meal is coming from (and there are plenty such today), everyone doesn't go to school for 13 years, as the children of District 12 do. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs dictates that food comes first. 16- and 18-year-olds wouldn't be attending classes that consist mainly of learning about coal mining. They'd be in the coal mines. So would 12-year-olds.

B004QKNRLE|5.0|The minds of people approaching the age of 60 are supposed to be invaded and captured by a first wave of childhood memories. It prompts self-centered Max Morden (MM), age unknown, to write this quite frank and transparent autobiography. So frank that after reading it, two dozen adjectives are insufficient to fully describe MM's own character, whose book is situated on the Irish coast with a view of the sea. Readers might want to make a tally of negative adjectives on MM, and compare them in book reviewing gatherings.<br /><br />MM is an elderly writer on French painters (a dilettante, second-rater in his own understated judgment), still quite tall, but in mental and physical decline. After the death of his wife Anna he has returned to where all his early life-stirring events and drama began, to The Cedars, the rented house the far wealthier Clare family occupied many decades ago. As a tall 11-year old he befriended the smaller, strange twins Myles and Chloe, fell in love with their mother but only weeks later became enchanted with Chloe. Now The Cedars has become a rundown lodging house with an eccentric landlady and only one other occupant of its six rooms for rent, a retired Colonel with set habits. The atmosphere!<br /><br />From a young age MM has been an acute watcher and every page provides evidence. In later life, when early memories crop up unaided, MM often links incoming thoughts and images to paintings he has studied and adores, Bonnard most of all (and de la Tour and Gericault, as MM would like me to add to this review). Late in the autobiography MM admits he has no personality, never had one. It may be the key admission in this brilliantly-paced, tragic and often hilariously-funny account of the life of a person unable to relate to anyone.<br /><br />John Banville won the 2005 Man Booker Prize with this masterpiece, which is perfectly paced, with surprises hidden throughout the book right until the final pages. On every page the reader is challenged to pick up a dictionary to acknowledge MM's Irish superior way with words. An absolutely great, rich and annually re-readable novel. And the gap of five or more decades between MM's youthful dreaming and his elderly self are for the reader to fabulate about.acknowledge MM's Irish superior way with words.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Got it last night and finished the first two levels pretty quickly.  Can't wait for more to be revealed!!
1594202842|2.0|Of the thousands of impassioned comments that hit the WSJ website following its publishing of the infamous &#34;Are Chinese Mothers Superior?&#34; excerpt, one of the most interesting ones came from an Asian woman who said she was an undergraduate at Harvard the same time as Amy Chua.  She was not a big fan of Chua, observing that Chua's unsavory personality appears unchanged from her college days.  She also remembered that while at Harvard, Chua showed little interest in taking part in activities or clubs aimed at Asian American students.<br /><br />While there's always the chance that this was the kind of fabrication that often appears on anonymous message boards, it rang true to me.  Here's an Asian archetype Amy Chua should consider: the upper middle class, educated Asian person who grew up in the United States, speaks perfect English, acts totally American and would barely know how to ask where the bathroom was if you dropped them into their parents' Asian homeland and who recoils from doing something as un-cool as hanging around lots of other Asians, but opportunistically trots out their alleged Asian-ness to impress their upper middle class white peers.<br /><br />I suspect that's what's behind one of the more annoying aspects of this book: Chua's constant invoking of &#34;Chinese&#34;-ness as if that were something she embodies and has the authority to define.  That's a real stretch coming from someone who is so plainly American in accent, demeanor, and life experience (watching one of her TV interviews for around 5 seconds reveals this).  The thing is, she undoubtedly knows this, being the extremely intelligent woman that she is.  So her constant invoking of the &#34;Chinese way&#34; and &#34;Chinese parenting&#34; seems like deliberate, cynical pandering to stereotypes that she believes American readers will lap up.<br /><br />In one strange passage in the book, she complains how some white men have Asian fetishes and will only date Asian women (Chua adds that these men do this even when the Asian women in question are not good-looking, which strikes her as particularly objectionable).  Meanwhile, she sings the praises of her accomplished husband and his Jewish background, proudly noting that Jewish man-Asian woman couples are ubiquitous in affluent communities such as hers.  This whole subject is worthy of a book in itself, but suffice it to say that this all reminded me of the personals ads I used to come across where Asian American women declared, &#34;I will not be your geisha girl!&#34; or &#34;If you're expecting a submissive, meek Asian woman, look elsewhere!&#34;, but then specified &#34;Asian Woman Seeks White Man&#34; in the headline.  I suspect that a truly &#34;Chinese&#34; person might not exhibit these types of internal conflicts.<br /><br />Despite her vigorous backpedaling during her PR campaign for the book, throughout &#34;Battle Hymn&#34;, Chua comes off as monomaniacal and abusive toward her daughters amidst her odd quest to make them into world-class musicians.  On some level, she may have a point:  it's true that you're not going to play at Carnegie Hall if you only practice 15 minutes a day and play with your friends all the time.  Then again, as so many have pointed out in the uproar surrounding this book, should &#34;success&#34; be defined only by the very narrow metrics Chua embraces?  Even if we do go by the popular measure of material wealth, I know that out in the business world, many (most?) extremely successful people were not child prodigies and did not experience anything close to &#34;Tiger Mom&#34; parenting, while plenty of Asian Americans with stereotypically domineering parents have not met with the same success, chosen predictable and somewhat dull careers, and remain resentful about their childhoods.<br /><br />The last few chapters of the book were a revelation.  Chua, in painful detail, writes about her younger daughter's &#34;rebellion&#34; and how her kids accuse her of being a &#34;freak&#34; and of only caring about herself.  Chua writes about her own father's estrangement from his parents due to *their* domineering parenting style.  She recounts how one of her students discovers some of the detailed practice instructions she wrote up for her daughters and is surprised at how his affable professor could ever be responsible for something so &#34;weird&#34;.<br /><br />In other words, all this criticism that everyone's thrown at Amy Chua in the aftermath of the WSJ article...she has heard it all before.  We are not telling her anything she doesn't know already.  How this ultra-smart, worldly, completely American woman can hear all these compelling criticisms yet remain so oblivious to the dark side of this style of raising kids is one of the big mysteries of this book.  Maybe it's that cynical pandering stuff, because she really ought to know better.self.  Chua writes about her own father's estrangement from his parents due to *their* domineering parenting style.

This is one of those albums you just have to have on vinyl, and by the way i rate this album 100 stars************ if i could No! i will, this is how good this album is please buy it!!!!!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the game! Had to root atrix phone to install amazon app store but well worth it. Never wanted to root phone until they kept me from angry birds!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it runs great on rooted hero. super smooth and love the graphics! much better than the original. I highly recommend..   Amazon fails with the twenty five word requirements on comments.  so dumb.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Good ole Angry Birds with a twist. you are rescuing targets instead if crushing them. I would expect other such product connections in the future.
0449227545|3.0|I really like the idea of the terrorist creating the earthquakes and the character Judy Maddox but I felt (like most reviewers) that their are huge holes in this plot.  This is like a summer blockbuster movie that you liked while watching it but afterwards you think about it and realize how that could never happen.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Works well on the Atrix. The only exception is a strange lack of smoothness on the pull back. On the 3GS there was fine control, while on my Droid it's all or nothing. Not bad, just different.
B004FGN3WC|4.0|Received an email from FoxConnect a short time ago offering this set for $99.99, with an additional $20.00 off using the promo code ALIENEGG.  I already have the DVD set so am not going to purchase again.  The four stars is only because of the policy to continually milk this series.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Updated version has barcode scanning ability, which I really liked when I was using iPhone. However, if I try to use the scanning, the app just crashes and the camera application no longer works unless the phone is rebooted.  This seems to be a serious bug.. Please take a look at the issue. I'm using the Nexus S with t-mobile.  Otherwise, it's great. So 3 stars.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I think it sucks that amazon has managed to secure exclusive rights to this game and then locks out the rest of the world by making it exclusive to the US. Even more galling that its free. Way to go alienating the rest of the world and loyal angry birds fans.
0756404738|3.0|This is not another Name of The Wind so I will not compare it but, I will say I felt it was a step down.  This is the only book that I have actually been asking about continually for the past oh I'd guess 3 or 4 YEARS!!!  Pat what the hell?  That alone drops it a star for me.  Do your job and write a book.  If your auto mechanic told you that they would have your car out of the shop in a week and it took them 4 I think you would be a little pissed!  The other star fell off when NOTHING HAPPENED!  This book felt like, a day one after thought, not day two.  The story didn't progress at all.  I know that the cool thing these days is to turn your story from a trilogy into four five or however many books you can but come on!  Having said that I love the writing style and while nothing happened it was entertaining.  I just really hope that the next book makes some headway.  I feel like I just heard a collection of good short stories at the local tavern not like I heard a true piece of the real story!  It hurts me to say this but, wait for the paperback.
0756404738|5.0|If you loved The Name of the Wind then you will love this book as well.  Rothfuss tells such a good story that somehow you feel emotionally attached to the characters and the events that happen within the book.  This series is shaping up to be one the best fantasy series in decades.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app came preloaded on my LG Vortex and I love it.  I don't own a kindle reader yet but have kindle for my laptop and they sync well.  Readability is good.  You can change back ground colors and adjust brightness.  If you don't have this app yet get it now! You will be glad you did.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this new version of the game! Runs great! Much smoother than the other versions. Never hurts to keep adding more levels like you do the other one's.  EVO 4G
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app came preloaded on my phone and I absolutely love it.  I can download books and take them anywhere.  My favorite feature is being able to change the background colors between white, sepia, and black.  (When the screen is black, the words are white).  Also, any books I purchase for my phone can also be seen on my Kindle and vise versa.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works fine on my droid x.  great graphics.  i like the &quot;free the birds&quot; theme.  monkeys were fun too.  ok word word word word word word...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Still prefer Stupid Zombies, but it's still an entertaining time killer. This twenty five word requirement is unnecessary Amazon, it's going to discourage people from writing reviews for apps.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Nothing new, must the same great gameplay you have come to know and love time and time again.  If you were looking for more than it's just not there.  Great game for any fan of the series!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Don't use this forced app on your Android. It's the same with spam, if you click on spam you justify advertisers to spam you more. Same here, you'll get more forced app on you phone you can't remove.
0385512104|1.0|It was my own lack of seeing that this was a \\"novel\\" that had me almost believing it was really an autistic kid writing his own story - for the first few pages.<br /><br />Then I thought an adult must have \\"helped\\" because something wasn't right with the writer's verbiage and the main character's actions pretty early on.<br /><br />There were inconsistencies all the way through. Every sentence starting with \\"And then...\\" for the last few chapters got very very tedious.<br /><br />The reason I used betrayed in my description is because only after the book ended and I was seriously scratching my head did I re-read the book cover and see \\"Novel\\". Oh, OK, that means it's fake. None of this was even real. That was a relief. I can't blame the author for my not seeing that, only it completely reprocessed the book in my brain so I wasn't bewildered any more, I was pissed.<br /><br />I don't think this book can possibly do anything positive for the person with AS or society in general. In fact I'd strongly recommend NOT reading it because it did not leave a positive impression on my AS brain and it can't help to further the cause of \\"normal\\" people understanding autism. Isn't there enough pain? It did nothing except exploit an already fragile perception of autism through an author's made up words that were jammed together to form an ugly story that isn't even true. I'm sorry I spent my money on this.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|If you use this software on your Android, you justify Amazon to force apps on you. It's the same with spam, you click on spam and you justify advertisers to spam you more.
B000RZGFZC|4.0|The adrenaline is very high in this album and its one of their most heavy (not thrash) albums. The re are tracks that makes the difference like Dead skin mask - spirit in black - seasons in the abyss and expendable youth. I believe that most fans of heavy metal music will like this album as i do. A must for Slayer fans and a good album to start with if you are new to Slayer
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this game is only missing the mighty eagle and i am hoping that rovio can now add the mighty eagle to the android version of this game throught the amazon appstore.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Hours of fun.  Great app for friendly competition with my wife.  My 4 year old daughter even loves it. Can't wait to beat all the levels.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I'm disappointed with rovio for only releasing this on amazons app store. why do I have to give payment details for a free dl? rovio have let themselves down by jumping into bed with amazon. probably a good game but I don't want one click billing on my phone so I can't install
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Boy, was I shocked when I discovered the subject matter in this movie!  I thought it was going to be about....well......travel.  If you don't mind subtitles this is an excellent product.  The love story is poignant and the sensitive subject matter beautifully handled.  It has changed the way I view our last sendoff and also, I have a new respect for the Japanese culture.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|it downloads, but won't install.  fail.  I followed the instructions to allow installs from 'unknown' sources and it still won't install.  stupid 25 word minimum.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD was an eye opener for me.  I have never looked at beef in the same way since viewing it.  I have changed my buying habits and I no longer eat in fast food restaurants.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I installed the amazon installer on my phone and yet, every time I try to download this app, it keeps saying there isn't space for it, but there is. This needs to be resolved.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|havent played much but so far the game lookes better and is just as much fun. runs smoothly on the gtab and fita perfectly on the screen. also enjoy freeing the birds rather than just killing different sized green pigs.
0756404738|5.0|I could not put this book now.  It is a well-written, exciting book with interesting characters and a great story.  I can't wait to read the third and final book of the trilogy!  I highly recommend this book.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|have played many levels on my droid but now will not load and forced closes. no message or anything. just tap on icon, it blnks, and nothing happens/app doesn't open.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app, i use it on a daily basis to listen to radio stations from back home, as well as music stations from around the world.... why need to pay for satellite radio?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Worked great on my droid x, install was easy and opened right up. fun game, looks good too. Can't wait for the updates. For those having problems, try rebooting the phone first, or turning airplane mode on then off
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is one of the very few apps I have actually paid for, and it was very, very much worth it. As other reviewers have stated, it is extremely useful for math, including all of calculus and differential equations! It can be slightly tedious typing the problems in by hand, but as you may well know it sure beats the 30 minutes it would take to solve analytically. It also provides way more info than you would ever want to know about almost every molecular compound and chemical out there. These are two examples out of thousands of uses. As unbelievable as it seems, it really does provide an answer to almost every physical thing.     For a \\"demo\\" I highly recommend checking out their website: [...]. The app is literally the exact same thing, except 100% mobile! Enjoy!
0316098337|5.0|Room is one of those books that you just have to finish. It doesn't matter that real-life is tormenting you. You have to ignore it, put your feet up and read.<br />What a fabulous read. It amazes me that Ms Donaghue can pull off a whole novel in the voice of a 5 year old boy without any inconsistencies. How I loved Jack - his mindset, his actions, his way of speaking. Precious little boy.<br />This is a psychological thriller too as, first, the reader is taken into the \\"Room\\" where Ma (we never discover her name) has been incarcerated after being kidnapped 7 years ago, and where Jack was born. This created the \\"will they escape? Won't they?\\"<br />Then, of course there's the trauma suffered by both the boy and mother. No spoilers here. Just read it and find out. It's a book you only find once in five years.
160059672X|5.0|Sherry's designs are truly some of the most beautiful that I have ever seen in the art of beading. She presents a gorgeous array of designs to complete and inspire. She gives some really usefull tips and tricks. In the actual instructions you need to probably have some familiarity with bead embroidery and basic bead stiches (using finding etc.) to follow along easily. I would not recommend this for beginners as a how to, but rather for intermidate level beader. Still anyone level artist could benifit from this book as a way to be inspired in the areas of color and design.    The book itself seems well put together. When I had ordered it I had not really paid attention to the fact that it is a hardback. The color is excellent and the book seems very sturdy. I am extremely pleased with the price on the book. It is a great bargain.
0385341679|4.0|I knew I would like Shadowfever, because I knew it would provide all the answers to all of the questions we have had since book one. It turns out that that was the only thing I liked about the book, however. I loved book one, but felt like the others were too long and accomplished nothing. Very little of importance happened in the middle installments. I found myself devouring this book turning page after page just to see what would happened. The revelations were not too shocking, but they were at least satisfying. I was hoping for no happily ever after, but that was not to be.<br /><br />I have to say that I dislike pretty much every character in this series except for V'lane. Mac is whiny, impulsive, and childish. I don't think she has matured as a character at all, and I never liked her in this entire series. Dani is the most irritating character I have ever had the misfortune of reading about, and I loathed her every appearance. The other characters are ok, and I do appreciate that many of the bad guys were not the stereotypical muahaha bad guys one usually sees. The environment, the plot, and the dialogue didn't thrill me. I didn't really care about Dublin, and I think I was supposed to. I didn't feel impending danger for the human race, because Mac didn't really seem to care about it. She would rather talk to Barrons for days than save the world. All in all this is really just one big overlong convoluted love story with some information held back to keep your attention throughout. Yet, it's one of the only books I've read lately that I couldn't put down. My thirst for answers kept me going, and I don't see how fans of the series will be disappointed in this too much. If this series were a trilogy instead of five books and edited down a bit I would have enjoyed it so much more, but it is what it is, and I'm glad it's over.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is a great series about Zombies taking over the world and how people can cope with the future.  The scenes with the zombies are raw and full of suspense with a great story arc.  I'm really looking forward to the second series this summer
0545265355|5.0|A friend of mine has been suggesting the Hunger Games trilogy to me for several months.  I found the concept of the books to be too depressing and morbid for my taste (I'm usually one to go for the romantic comedies.)  Finally, she convinced me that I should give the trilogy a chance, so I ordered the box set from Amazon.  It was a great price for such a nice, hard cover set.  I am so happy she talked me into it.  These books are by far some of my favorite books I have ever read.  Although the storyline is morbid and has many deaths, the story overtakes it. I was drawn into Katniss' life from the very first chapter of Hunger Games.  I could not put the books down.  I know the books are for young adults, but I think that the more mature the reader, the more you will get out of it.  However, I think people of all ages can really enjoy the series.  The final book, Mockingjay, had more twists and turns than I could begin to imagine.  You begin to question everything you have already read in the first two books.  It's definitely not a light hearted read.  However, everyone I know that has read the books agrees that they are amazing.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Good little puzzle game, much like Seventh Guest or Myst. Unfortunatly had the game won in less than a hour. Not really any reason to play he game again after you have beaten it.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|What can I say...Movie isn't as good as book but they did a great job. Liked it better than the 1st movie in this series.  If you have'nt read the books I recommend you do, so much has been left out and it will give you more of an experience with all the characters.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|If you have problem installing the app, try connecting to PC as 'Disk Drive' and delete '.android_secure' directory. Disconnect and try installing again.
B0001I561E|5.0|I think this is a great film I was reordering it in dvd because I owned it on video. Unfortunately I have never received this new product I have sent several requests and have not gotten any response. This is the first problem I have had using Amazon but I will be leery to purchase anything else in the future if it has to do with a third party purchase.
B004GYY714|5.0|This radio works very well! It rarely stops working and you can sort radio stations by genre, location (state, local, national, and countries).  It's amazing being able to listen to radio stations from around the world.  Although it has a presets area, I wish you could choose from a list of favorites, or reorder the presets area.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I will start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed the first book, and this one, as well. However, if the main storyline doesn't gain traction in the next book, I'm not sure I'll be sticking around. We're two books in(both very large @ 900ish pages) and we're still dealing with events MANY years before the present day in the story. Given how things are going, I can only assume we're going to get another 2-3 books before we get to present time, and I cannot deal with another WOT series.    This book is a great read, and I enjoyed it. Just be aware that we're still laying out the background of what's happened several years in the past, and nothing at all is seen of present day events.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I installed the app store, set up 1 click, and so on, only to find the the app store only works in the USA at this time, so why did they ask me to install it, it set up 1 click,  If this game was on Android market and worldwide, much more people would have download it, to the devs, guys you are a European company so you should have released it in Europe first or put it on general realese from the srart.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this app is the greatest app and will not need a nother app ever again yes for saving the birds<br />.. please update fast and soon
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Wow. When I bought this I expected some cheap little, boring game this is awesome.  I believe the best thing in this game is the layout &amp; graphics.it is also a great game. I love it.
B004FEFZU2|4.0|Nice ending to a one of the best thrillers ever.. However, still leaves question marks as to whether this is really the last as they claim. Though a bit short on 90min still an engaging finale till the very end. Based on the 3D effects i only gave it a 2.5, not much in it really. I think Amazon should start having 2 different ratings for these newly released 3D blue ray films, one for the rating for the actual film story itself, the other for the 3D effects.
0385341008|5.0|I have to admit that when I was given this book as a gift, I was skeptical. The title sounded a bit \\"fluffy\\" and I wasn't entirely sold on a story told entirely through letters.<br /><br />I'm sold now.<br /><br />Having read it twice now, I can't imagine how the story could have been told so convincingly WITHOUT doing it in letters. The format lets the reader \\"hear\\" each unique voice and perspective without losing the thread of the story. I also loved being able to read for just two or three minutes (I spend a lot of time on public transport) and to pick up exactly where I left off the last time, without fumbling around trying to remember just where I'd been. The characters are endearing, and I appreciated that the authors didn't try to develop and resolve every character and story line that appeared. The letters showed snippets of life, not the whole thing -- just like letters do. Two thumbs way up for this delightful little book.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Although the first 20% of Room seemed to drag, I think in retrospect it was because I was getting used to the very strong voice. Soon, I couldn't put it down, and raced through to the satisfying end. The story has a strong emotional impact without being sentimental, and I have to confess, I was so captivated by Jack, it's difficult to say good-bye.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Jennifer has truly got the anointing over her. She has been hand chosen by God to help us go to heaven! This is more than just a musical masterpiece, this is a tool of God. She is truly an inspiration for all of us, and she is trying to uplift us and helping us love one another. Beyonce can't sing like this, she has to do so many tricks and dances its ridiculous. Her songs teach selfish-ness, insecurity, jealousy, and everything that's of the devil.  OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE! This is more than music, its a war over our souls! Let's start our journey to the Lord! He is a loving God, He will forgive your sins! Just believe in Him and obey Him!    But anyway, this is music right here! I can't wait to see Jennifer Hudson live!
1591843790|5.0|In his quick-witted and user-friendly way of speaking, Guy Kawasaki, in Enchantment, does a fine job in getting you from theory to practice. He outlines the conceptual pieces of being enchanting, or having influence, in a way that people can grasp immediately. Then he leads you to the implementation of the concepts and practices and how they apply to your business. Without saying, it is clear Guy knows business is about people.  You quickly see where the `hot' points are to connect with people, whether it's your employees or your boss.<br /><br />As a specialist on influence and women, there are several key pieces that I have found to be especially valuable to women. He touches on the concept of likeability, which is a continuous issue for women ... who are looking for respect, wanting to be valued for their ideas, and have many gifts to give. Guy, touches on the following points on enchantment, which I would like to describe from the woman's point of view.<br /><br />The first main point Guy makes is likeability. Women wrestle with the distinction of being likeable versus the need to be liked. This presents a dilemma for women because women are conditioned to please and do for others. When women want to be liked they may exhibit behavior that is not necessarily appropriate in the workplace. It's about being professional not flirty or overly agreeable. Guy says, \\"do what your boss tells you to do. The relationship will develop from there, giving you the opportunity to express yourself while maintaining respect and likeability.\\"<br /><br />Guy talks about making a good first impression, your smile, dress, handshake and vocabulary. It's the vocabulary or language that women need to pay attention to.  Corporate and business language is fairly military-based. It's the language of kill or be killed - strategy, execution, win, competition, and tactics. Is that natural for women? No. But it is something women need to recognize in how the language they use affects the respect or validation they get. In order to get close to someone you need to use the language they use.<br /><br />At the same time, Guy talks about getting close to people you want to enchant, he discusses the role of technology. Technology has allowed women to form more communities. Look at the vast numbers of women on the social media sites, sharing, supporting and building relationships. Social media has opened up a whole new dimension which women are using to be heard.<br /><br />Another point Guy makes about likeability is to know and share your passion. This comes naturally to women. Especially when we are encouraged to talk about how we feel, what we know in our gut and how we interpret information. Women are extremely successful in creating win-win situations.<br /><br />Trustworthiness is Guy's second main point of being enchanting. Trusting others is the first step in becoming trustworthy. Women need to make trust in their private relationships a cornerstone. We need to also do the same in the workplace. An example is, how female bullies in the workplace violate trust in their relationships. The growing issue around female bullying is an example of how not to be likeable or trustworthy.<br /><br />Guy includes in Enchantment a short step-by-step way to position yourself for becoming likeable and gaining trust when giving your 30 second elevator pitch about you and your business. Women find this easy because we are closely in touch with our feelings. We aren't afraid of introspection and expressing. This is one of our advantages in becoming enchanters.<br /><br />Another part of Enchantment I found useful, on the whole for women, is how to overcome resistance. In particular, the part about framing competition. Woman are terrible in identifying who their real adversaries are. We need to think about who we trust and how that's built. We need to do a better job in how we perceive and truthfully express what and who the competition is.<br /><br />I think one section women will enjoy and possibly relate to is on how to resist enchantment. Guy talks about noticing fake and phony enchanters. He urges us to recognize when the enchanter is not acting with integrity. This is when the book gets interesting as we've all been in situations where we've liked and trusted another person and have been hurt. Guy addresses this by saying it's unethical to enchant the gullible person since they are prone to vulnerability. And the person who enchants, and doesn't have their best interest at heart is not ethical by any stretch of the imagination. His solution? Stay away from dishonest people who your gut says aren't trustworthy.<br /><br />Guy's book, Enchantment, does a great job of raising points that women can use as guides to becoming powerful enchanters.hantment.

B001I0T92Q|1.0|This is an awesome adapter, and it works great.  But it is made of a very cheap material that breaks and cracks easily.  Buyer beware.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I love the new game but it keeps closing on me!!!! I'll be in th,e middle of a level and then it shuts down and goes to my home screen!
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|This movie is good but not all that good and didn't had that much action scenes. \\"EVANGELION 1.11: You are (not) alone\\" on blu ray is a good addition to you collection/library. The story is solid (even though I had no idea what sense the story is trying to say, probably because I didn't watch the original series). The animation is far-by outstanding in High definition. But sometimes, I feel that the main character isn't that well developed until the end of movie. Overall: This is a movie that I recommend to any fan of the original series, Blu ray fan, or anime fan. thats why I'm giving \\"EVANGELION 1.11: You are (not) alone\\" a B+. Can't wait for the next movie (which is going to be released next week) \\"EVANGELION 2.22: You can (not) advance\\"! XD
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just like the rest of their series, this game is awesome. Not much more I can say about it. Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!
B004SBQGHS|3.0|The game itself is a reasonably good game. Not quite as addictive for me as it appears it is for others. But it works nice & smoothly, and looks very good (HTC Desire HD).    However, I do not understand why you would pay for it when it is available for free. Yes, the free version is ad supported, and I have seen all the reviews on here along the lines of \\"At last! Ad Free.\\", but it really isn't necessary to spend your pennies to have a legitimately ad free game. Simply turn off all of your data connections.    I have a data panel widget on my home screen. I can turn off data connection with a single touch. I can turn off WiFi with a single touch. With no active data connection you get no ads at all. And it does not even reserve blank screen space for ads either.    Sure, I understand that the ads pay the developers, and are the reason we get it for free. However, this should be a lesson on ad placement. There are applications and games that I use where the ads are really NOT obtrusive when using the application. Sometimes it's a matter of screen layout, whereas others only display ads on the menus. This is something all the developers should learn from if they want to maximise ad revenue. I do NOT turn off my data connection for unobtrusive ads.    So I would recommend you give this a miss, stick with the free version & simply turn off your data when you play. Afterall, you don't want your game to be interrupted by emails anyway. ;)
B000FC13MM|5.0|When i first read Sabriel back when I was 12 years old. I was truly captivated and mesmerized by the Old Kingdom. The world Nix created that is side by side with the modern world, and only divided by the Wall. The Old Kingdom is devoid of technology and only the use of old practices to create products are used. (Like non-machinery made.) And the people, well some of them are baptized with a Charter Mark. A blessing that connects them to the Charter of all living things.<br />Sabriel, is a modern girl that grew up away from the Old Kingdom. And although she lived with the conveniences of technology, she is instructed to learn the ways of an Abhorsen-in-waiting (sort of like an apprentice) from the Abhorsen who is her father. The Abhorsens main job is to guard the boundary between life and death, and send any spirits that have crossed into Life back to the gray waters of Death.<br />Sabriel, is clearly a smart, strong, and serious character throughout this book. If you like books that poke fun at their position and show a bit of humor. This isn't a book you should read. Sabriel learns quickly that she cannot be the same school girl in Ancelstierre when she receives a calling card that her father is missing. She crosses the Wall back into the Old Kingdom knowing little of her future, but realizing very soon she must become hard-willed if she is to confront the threat against her family.<br />In someways Sabriel is a fast paced book. I loved it and the books that followed, Lirael and Abhorsen. I can't quite say what this book might be similar to because I have never come across a book like it. It is simply a book on its own. If i must say what it could resemble if combined with other books.. I would say it is like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Minus, the Orcs, Elves, Dwarfs, Naz-gouls, and wizards. Just the landscape and the lifestyle of the people would be what best describes the Old Kingdom. The magic in this book would probably be best described as,.... Riordan's Kane Chronicles type of magic. The Ancient Egyptian symbols they use to invoke their spells is verry similar to Charter magic. Only difference though with Charter magic you use symbols that describe many things or objects, and combine them into one spell, thus giving you a master charter mark that describes the entire spell. Quite complicated.. you learn more about Charter magic I think with the second book, Lirael. And with the dark part of the Sabriel, well... you'll see. I guarantee its a great book and it has been my favorite book for the past 12 years. Love it, Love it....Chronicles type of magic.

B00127RAJY|5.0|One of my friends recommended this workout, and I have thanked her several times. After a year of slow and steady weight loss, I had hit a frustrating plateau. This workout helped me bust right through it! It really is a great workout in a short amount of time, and by increasing the hand weights, I'm still getting a good workout at Level 1, so I don't think I'll outgrow this workout any time soon. I'll be using it in about 30 minutes from now!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|got 3 stars on all other ab offerings. this ed is long waited. first 4 levs played great. many design improvements. need a few more words...
0399250573|5.0|I've seen a comment or two on cyber-space saying that this book is pretty good but unoriginal. Not true-Scorpia Rising has to be considered one of the greatest books in the series! The plot for global chaos is simpler and less grandoise than traditional doomsday plots in spy novels yet still nefarious, complex, and honestly put all OF the good guys (unlike in previous entries to the Alex Rider canon) COMPLETELY in the dark. The character development and relationships between the main quartet in the Alex Rider series is interesting and genuine. Some of the twist are shocking! And for long time fans such as myself, the tragic demise of one of the characters really made me emotional. Sure, I felt at times there was a bit too much talk, and I felt like I would've liked to see Alex Rider in a little more control and great-classical chases (as we've read about in the past), and I would've loved to see him truly go beserk on SCORPIA in the final chapters of the novel, but I think the story greatly makes up for it. A perfect finale for a great series!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Some people crying foul play because of the app store... Worked great for my phone galaxy s... N this game is great by the way
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a very entertaining game.<br />I never played the original (or first release of this game), but this one is in itself a lot of fun and not very easy to achieve the maximum points in some of the challenges (I have played some 25 of them).<br />The idea is pretty macabre to think about \\"shooting birds with a slingshot\\" and these kamikaze birds break everything \\"almost\\" (they don't agree well against cinder blocks or steel sheets). But don't think they're birds or frozen chickens, they could be coconuts or balls and you'll have fun too :)<br /><br />Update: now that I have played the original, and the seasons versions, I still like this one much more. I like the scenery and the monkeys better than the pigs... also the music is very contagious. Great game to spend hours improving your previous score :)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I am sure the new angry birds are great...but it wont install on my droid 2...ive read a lot of people are having similar problems and you must connect to your computer and delete files and such...that seems like a lot of work for an app that SHOULD work...soooo 1 star...maybe change it after i can install the app...way to go amazon!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|If you are going to lock down an ip this big don't do it for US only. You have built resentment for a lot of loyal fans.  Horrible practice to take all kinds of private and financial data before telling someone they can't buy from your store. Worst PR move ever.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|downloaded and beat the first section yesterday. absolutely love the aesthetics, the theme song is swaggy &amp; the various locations &amp; targets are pretty sweet. best version ever, my two week wait was worthwhile!
1576754227|5.0|I read the book and do exactly what Brian taught me to do. Time management starts with priority setting. Now my work efficiency improve a lot and my pay was double within 2 months. It really works well for me. THank you Tracy.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|While most people think that Daft Punk did everything in this soundtrack they're wrong. To be quite honest, the orchestral pieces(which are not done by Daft Punk) are the driving force of this soundtrack. Daft Punk is merely a small accent to this great soundtrack.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|I very much like it, and I don't expect The Strokes to make the same record every time.  Being an active independent (not signed) recording artist myself, and my sound evolves with every release.  The songs are, fun, nicely-written and catchy, making it a great consistent release.  Regarding the production, I love how it's been produced, it sounds like 2011 (no need for them to sound like 2001).  Even with a few undeservedly negitive reviews currently, I think Angles with will be considered another great Strokes record right along with their previous three brilliant efforts.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a great game! Love the original, this is better! Had no probs downloading app store &amp; game on my Droid X. Lovin it!  :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another great app from Angry Birds!  They do not disappoint on the latest  version.  Great levels and I like the addition of unlocking the hidden pineapples.
B0037QGRZG|4.0|Ok, I've probably seen this movie too many times, but in it's own way, it always seems timeless!     I've bought other Karate movies, but when my twin 6 year old Son and Daughter showed sustained interest in Karate, I decided to purchase this martial arts, and family classic.
1439102724|5.0|First, I won't go through all the same information that others have written quite well. I love, love, love this book. And the reviewer who added quotes----that was great. I just suggest that if you're trying to decide if you should read this book, read all the reviews that give this book 5 stars.  I would give it more stars if there were more to give.    When I finished this book, I put it down and just said \\"WOW\\".  I was speechless--couldn't find more words to describe it.  I have been a long time reader of Ms. Picoult and this was a fabulous read. Yes, it will create criticism and controversy---but it's certainly a book to open up discussions on being gay, being a \\"born again\\" Christian, being married and divorced, being infertile, being the \\"gestational host\\" and losing so much in your life--including a much wanted and loved child.     A master wrote this book and it should be read by all who love good books.   Enjoy.  And, yes, the CD is very calming. The words are very sweet and the singer reminds me of the era of Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, and other very soft spoken singers who only use a guitar for music. Very relaxing and enjoyable.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is similar in action to previous games, but differs in that you try to free birds rather that kill pigs.<br /><br />Works flawlessly on HTC Thunderbolt (as expected) and according to the Android battery utility uses less power than the original Angry Birds.  Have also seen the app run smoothly on older devices (Samsung Moment to be specific) which couldn't run previous versions of Angry Birds, so it seems Rovio has made some improvements under the hood.
B000002B2T|5.0|As much as I love Alice in Chains -- and I genuinely do! -- I have always wished that Staley would do a little less on the screeching vocals and sing more of that snarl-type rich tenor voice.  Don't get me wrong, the Staley screech is a great sound, but I always thought it would be served as an augmentation to his very rich singing instead of splitting the screech with the rich \\"snarl\\" 50-50.      Well, this album does that.  On this album, you will hear just how soulful Layne's voice truly was, how deep and rich it was.  Yes, he does throw in some of the scream-type singing, but it's more as a highlight than as a baseline, and that is what I wished for in AIC.      Although the musical writing cannot compare with Cantrall's from AIC, the songs are still damn good, a couple of them actually great, and Staley's voice is epic.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I jumped through the hoops to install the app store, but the game won't install.  If I go back to try and install the game again I get the message \\"You already own Angry Birds Rio - please find it under the 'All' tab in 'My Apps' \\".  However, in the 'All' tab of 'My Apps' it says 'No Apps'.  I restart phone and still get the same message.      Now I'm reading that even if I CAN get the game to install, it cannot be played unless I'm logged into the Amazon App Store!?!?  Will that be the same for every app downloaded through this app store?    Overall, a BAD first impression!  I'm uninstalling the app and the app store until I hear better things.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I had seen a few versions of the movies or tv series of this book.  I had listened to the book on tape, but I never found Rochester appealing until this film.  Finally I understood why Jane would find him attractive.  I just found him over bearing in other film versions.  And I tend to read books with a rather neutral inflection and didn't see his teasing.  I could see how her relationship with him helped her become more fully herself.  I like how passionate they are with one another in this film.  Both actors seemed perfect in their roles.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|This is one of just a few of my favorite SciFi movies.  A classic tale with remarkable special effects, especially for the period it was produced.  And the mini Robbie the Robot is a definite plus!!!  I never get tired of watching this movie.
B003L20IFQ|2.0|i got this movie for free...and still fast fowarded cause you have to be pretty<br />bored to give 2 hours of your life looking at a movie about a guy buried underground. This would have been better in a book format...at least you can do<br />your reading outside and not be stuck in front of a black box waiting for things<br />to happen and get dissapointed cause you probably had to pay to look at a black<br />box...
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I followed  everything they said to do  and it still would not download on a the  Android  Incredible.  Glad I did not pay for it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i dont know why people keep saying it doesnt install on the droid x?  it works great on mine!  love the game!  graphics are amazing!
B0042JTDXK|2.0|When your ex-girlfriend who's a big Josh fan, has all his CDs and yet finds his newest boring and a dud then something is up.    In fact I'm not a Groban fan at all but his previous works all had some hooks to get into and enjoy (thanks to girlfriend's finger firmly on repeat). Apart from the opening instrumental nothing gets my attention. And I point the finger firmly on Rick Rubin. First every singer and his dog got Eno to produce, now the in-thing is to strip down and Rubin is in fashion now. With Groban it's like mixing oil and water. What's next, Rubin producing Iron Maiden?? This album is a match made in hell. Still Josh will rise again.    (Note I've got nothing against Rubin per se at all, he is a great producer - for the right artists).
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have to say I really love this iteration of Angry Birds. I like the concept of releasing the birds of Rio, it's different and just as entertaining as bashing into pigs. Now, I know this app is receiving a ton of negative reviews because it doesn't work on the Droid X and it's not available internationally. However, if you don't fall into any of those two categories, then this is a FIVE STAR APP...<br /><br />P.S. I'm using an HTC Thunderbolt and Angry Birds Rio runs as smoothly as butter.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|what my surprise after download the amazon apps and enter alllllll my informations to see &quot;not available for your region&quot; it's ridiculus... i want it for canada too !!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game cause it's free. Fun killer time.  Is it already 25 words? Damned it, I guess not.  What else can I say? Angry Birds Rule. Finally
B004L49K20|1.0|I love Duran Duran.  I don't want to offend anyone who likes this CD, but if a CD stinks, no matter how much I like the band, I'll be honest about it.  I think this is a terrible release.  Duran Duran hasn't released a good CD in years.  Duran Duran needs to retire.  There wasn't a single song that I liked on this release.  I think music fans sometimes long for the \\"good ole days\\" when a band was popular and get a little biased when reviewing new material.  Wanting to give a good review to try to get people to by the material and they be popular again.  Nothing wrong with that.  But there's really nothing here worth spending any money on.  If thinking about buying this, preview it first.  I wish I had.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Guess it is a love-it-or-hate-it kinda of game. Very lame. Uninstalled it in less than 15 minutes of play time. Not my thing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have the Motorola Atrix. It is a great phone. However AT&T has yet to add Amazon to their trusted source list. They said it is coming soon. How long does it take to determine if Amazon is a reputable company. Be for real. This means most AT&T customers cannot download this game or the Amazon App without resorting to a technique called side-loading.<br /><br />With some work I was able to get the game installed and I really love it. I think it is the best version of Angry Birds yet. Instead of attacking pigs like in previous version you free your buddies (birds of course). Plays very smooth, and the graphics are the best of this series yet.<br /><br />I had a small panic attack after installing and Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons disappeared from my app list. Thankfully they showed back up about 1 minute later.<br /><br />Totally worth 99 cents (or free if you get in on the deal of the day).
B004H7QICG|5.0|Purchased this case for its sound dampening materials. Now I struggle to hear if my PC is on... That includes when a pair of crossfile 5770 are churning away. This case is very well engineered. Removable back tray to hide all your cabling. Power supply at the bottom, plenty of cooling, with speed controlled fans. I love this case. It is everything you could ever want in a well engineered case. Yes it's expensive, but you do pay for what you get.  My other PC just annoys me now, everytime I hear the HD clicking away or fan going. I'm probably going to have to buy another one of these Antec's to shut the thing up.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This version of the game works great.  Also the levels look so much nicer.  Gameplay is still the same and just as addicting as the previous versions.  Definitely pick this up if you liked the originals.  DX
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love it! I like how it's a smaller app as well. I can't wait to see what comes next from them! Great devs fersure.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I love the other Angry Bird games so I wanted this one too. I could not download the game to my phone. said unsecessful. I tried several times, still nothing
B001TW69J4|4.0|For the most part, I have never heard of Tosin Abasi.  Looking at the work he has contributed to outfits like Veil of Maya, I never saw anything that overly impressed me.  Then again when a guitarist is a member of a band, he has to be a team player and cannot be too flashy.<br /><br />In the credits of the self-titled album, it is notable that all the music is the brain work of Abasi.  His compositions tend to be repetitive, but overall AAL is a great listen.  Its nice to hear an aggressive approach to guitar without Cookie Monster vocals.  Two tracks worth checking out regardless of opinion and bias are \\"On Impulse\\" and \\"Song of Solomon\\".
B004SBS8LA|2.0|The app store has to be installed and running in order for this game to work so I definitely WILL review the store. Really complicated to even get this game installed, had to input credit card info. B.S. Game itself is alright, nothing revolutionary.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Great graphics but seems WAY easier than original version. While the original was often frustratingly difficult, this one is almost too easy.  Would be good for children.
0307477479|4.0|I can see why Jennifer Egan's latest book's been racking up the prizes, most recently the National Book Critics Circle Award.  It's beautifully crafted at a sentence by sentence level, expansive in scope - spanning the continent and over 50 years' of our recent history, and wildly various in its exploration of the inner worlds of many diverse characters.    Summing it up feels nearly impossible, because this novel's about what all great novels are about: nothing short of the nature of human beings, our choices, our challenges, our idiosyncrasies, our failings, and our occasional moments of grace.  Egan takes it all on, and we cruise or drift or hurtle along with her as one character after another takes the stage.  She adeptly shifts perspective among these loosely connected people, exploring who they are as their paths briefly cross, weaving a web of connection that anchors the book.  Ultimately, though, it's more like that famous abstract Pollock painting hanging in the Metropolitan than a roller-coaster ride: equally thrilling, but in a single panel rather than a flow.  Or perhaps it's more like a symphony heard live at Avery Fischer Hall:  each instrument, each character cleanly addressing your ear while their combined forward movement creates an ineffable impression replete with drama, beauty, and pathos.    I was reminded often of Colum McCann's Let The Great World Spin, another polyphonic novel set mainly in NYC.  Egan's book spans more time (about half a century) and more places (SF as well, and even Italy and Africa, briefly) but offers a similar building-up of a world and a social network so richly conveyed that you feel you're right there breathing the atmosphere of these settings alongside the characters.  And not only does Egan employ a variety of viewpoints, she also bends form a bit:  My favorite chapter offered a series of PowerPoint slides created as a visual-verbal diary by a young girl who is the child of one of the central characters.  It providesa unique reading experience while offering humor and subtlety and social commentary all at once.  And, in fact, the whole PowerPoint is available on Ms. Egan's website: [...]    In my view, this novel - or series of interwoven short fictions, as some describe it - deserves all the accolades it's getting.  I recommend it to you with confidence.
B0039A8QVI|5.0|It has been a long time since I had paid attention to \\"new\\" country music. I grew up listening to country music as a child but ventured away from the genre when the sound became more influenced by pop and rock. One day while searching youtube for some Alan Jackson music videos, I found an Easton Corbin video on the side bar and discovered the best country artist to hit the industry in a long time. This self titled debut CD is a must own for any true country music fan.    Though one or two of the songs on this album took a few listens for me to like, the album is flawless. It's been in my truck since they day I bought it and I have no plans to take it out anytime soon. Songs like \\"Roll With it\\", \\"A little More Country than That\\", and \\"Don't Ask me about a woman\\" are pure examples of up-beat country gold. The gem of this album for me is \\"I can't love you back\\", a wonderful ballad that has a catchy tune and pulls on your heart strings. This entire album puts me in mind of the type of country music from the early 90's when I was a young boy. Easton Corbin has a long and bright future ahead of him, and I for one can't wait to hear how it sounds.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its working fantastic and it also looks grate on my nexus s. Its way better than the original one. It sucks we only get two chapters.
B0006PV5U8|5.0|I will keep this short, and start by saying that I am a classical violinist who learned Sibelius and Glazunov while listening to these recordings, among others. The recording quality is outstanding on all 3 concertos, and I have no problem with the voicing of anything. I feel that the recordings are somewhat idealized for the orchestra, and for these concertos that means dark and smooth. That might just be the instruments used, but I doubt it. Regardless, it gives an amazing backdrop that I have yet to find an equal of for Heifetz.<br /><br />Heifetz of course is Heifetz, and as the other reviewers said, these recordings do nothing if not showcase his bow technique. If the orchestra is smooth and dark, he is harsh and dark. He has easily one of the most messy bow techniques of anyone ever, but he finds a way to make it work beyond belief. In any case, he rarely misses anything, and neither does the orchestra. One reviewer pointed out 1 time where the orchestra was not together, and I laughed a little inside. There are many times when the orchestra is not perfect, and when Heifetz leads them by a mile. But that is what makes these so special. This is not some mix of 15 different takes, this is the real thing. We are shown as close to a live performance as you can get to I think, considering the outstanding quality. There are mistakes, but they are turned into marvelous musical interpretation.<br /><br />My teacher, who received 3 degrees from Juliard back in its day, was talking to me about the Glazunov recording. He said he loved to slow it down and listen to all the places where Heifetz messes up, and as he says this he's glowing with excitement. I think this sums up these recordings well. No matter if you choose to appreciate them or not, you cannot deny what Heifetz does for people.
B0034DGP6S|3.0|I came close to putting this book down a few times. It just became too dry, particularly in the chapter about the history of marriage.  The cross over between documentary and personal love story was at times awkward and it was hard to determine which of these directions Elizabeth Gilbert would follow.     The best bits of this book where when Elizabeth Gilbert focused on the 'real' marriages she came across in her life and travels, as well as her own relationship. The cross overs to long detailed academic examinations of the historical, cultural and legal aspects of marriage seemed somewhat out of place and boring.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I have all four of Justin's CDs, My World, My World 2.0, My worlds acoustic & Never say never: the remixes. I'm an obsessed Justin Bieber fan. A biebette. A belieber. I just love him sooo much!!!! Anyways... this one is my favorite cd. I love EVERY song on it, especially Baby, Runaway Love, U Smile & Never Let You Go. Every cd of Justin's is amazing. Justin is so cute, so funny, so sweet and charming and his music is great! But, he really has talent. I mean, just look at Allstar Weekend, the jonas brothers, hannah montana, etc. none of them have real true talent. i mean, sure their songs r fun to listen to, but they don't really have singing talents. And singing is just one of justin's many talents. If you haven't seen his movie never say never (which ive seen 4 times), you should have because it's amazing and it shows all of his talents. singing, dancing, instruments, he's just great. And i am SOOO sick and tired of adults saying only classical, violin, ancient stuff is \\"good\\" music. I'm tired of adults saying a good looking dude is someone who wears tuxedos and has freshly gelled hair. Well they are wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My mom is 30 and she LOVES justin bieber almost as much as i do. And i'm serious. She is singing in the car, humming the songs while she cleans the house, screaming at the concerts, etc. SO TO ALL THOSE ADULTS OUT THERE THAT SAY JUSTIN BIEBER IS NOT TALENTED AND HIS MUSIC IS STUPID AND ONLY FOR KIDS AND HE SOUNDS LIKE A GIRL AND STUFF....WHATEVER, HE'S REALLY GREAT AND YOU MUST BE DEAF TO NOT HEAR HOW AMAZING HE SINGS AND YOU MUST BE BLIND NOT TO SEE HOW ADORABLE HE IS. That's all I have to say! I will not be mean to anyone, I'm just saying those who don't like him are plain wrong. Quit hating him. He's only 17 years old hes just a kid, and a sweet sweet kid, SOOO cute and yall are hating cuz yall just jealous. Bye<br /><br />&lt;3 JB!!!<br />(btw suzanne is not my real name, this is my mom's account and im 11)

1416596097|1.0|LeCarre spends so much time describing the clothing, the furniture, even the weather that I started screaming for Hemingway economy of words. I could not get to Page 100. Boring. Dull.
B004H2ZFPW|5.0|Avril is the rare artist that truly evolves and challenges her vocal talent.  Plus, kudos for her instrumental and production credits, all worthy efforts.  Bottom line, her albums do not dissapoint, showing a consistency that speaks to her committment to be a creative force and not just a commercial success.  Also, the enhanced version is a bargain for the extra $3, offering four additional tracks and the dvd.  With this powerhouse demonstration of range and layered emotion, the album is 5 star for sure.  Fitingly, the Bad Reputation song cuts short to show that she will stay edgy and rock on.
1439107955|4.0|I don't think that the difficulty in writing \\"A Biography of Cancer\\" can be overstated, yet Siddhartha Mukherjee manages to pull it off with a flair and comprehensiveness that is truly admirable.     The book takes the reader from ancient beliefs about cancer through the most recent methods in diagnosis and treatment. This is potentially very dry material, but Mukherjee has a real talent for focusing on the big picture and not getting lost in a sea of distracting details. He is able to discuss the basic biology behind the development and growth of cancer, as well as how current cancer therapies do their jobs. He also outlines the more global overall thinking on cancer, its causes, and the best strategies for treatment. This serves to highlight more general tendencies of the medical community to bind tightly to concepts until the next paradigm-shifting discovery comes along, which is usually first met with deep suspicion followed by growing acceptance. Somehow he manages to cover these subjects while conveying a real compassion for cancer patients and the challenges they face.     The only shortcoming of the book is an acceptable one. Because Mukherjee himself does research on hematological cancers such as leukemia, there is a slant of the book in that direction at the cost of missing some of the greatest cancer stories in recent years (ie the identification of HPV and the development of a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer). Nonetheless, his knowledge of the field as a whole is prodigious and truly commendable.     I give this book a strong recommend for anyone who wants a fundamental understanding of cancer(s) and how scientists approach the problems of prevention and cure.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Cool this app is great. Angry birds is great for everyone. I haven't even played this one but I hear it head upgraded graphics. Ummm yeah 25 word min...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. however it says they're releasing more parts by month ? what the heck. the movie comes out soon.. just release everything when it comes out !
0756404738|5.0|If you've read \\"The Name of the Wind\\" you must read \\"Wise Man's Fear\\".  Prepare to get nothing done until you finish it.  It's a real page turner.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I thought its going to same old Angry Birds with new set of levels...but the whole design and stuffs are changed...its really cool to play... looks like Game Play is the same...have not played all the levels yet...lets see..
B004DTLK8A|5.0|I think many old fans will become pleasantly surprised by Elysium, and it's representation of a new found vigor for it's creator. Highly recommended to any fan of the genre
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome game with improved graphics and great music from the movie, Rio.  I really enjoy this version more than others and the fact I got it free is outstanding.  I really do enjoy Amazon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great fun. App works very well, no glitches. I could spend hours playing! Excellent app to kick off the opening of Amazon's app store. Good job!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie was enjohyed by all the family.  Even tho we knew the outcome of the races, we all got into the mood and were rooting for Secretariat/
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its The Original Angry Birds on CRACK!  AWESOMENESS! I love the updated graphics. I am so addicted to ANGRY BIRDS.  Great job to the developers.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you have a elocity A7 like me you know we don't have access to android marketplace. But Amazon App Store and this Angry Birds Rio will work on your tablet. Finally I can get some frikkin android apps.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The latest entry in the Angry Birds series has updated graphics with excellent backgrounds and a flashy parallax scrolling effect between fore and backgrounds. The new \\"baddies\\" offer new challenges (you stupid monkeys!) and there are new objects to collect (what, in an MMO, would be called \\"grind\\").<br /><br />There are minor issues. They physics, as in the other AB games, is not always accurate. As this is a casual game and not, for example, a wood-splintering simulator it doesn't detract much from the experience aside from the occasional hair-pulling frustration.<br />The touch issues I mentioned are irritating, not deal-breaking (especially for free). Sometimes buttons will react to a tap (e.g. depress or flash) but the game will not. It can take two, three, or even several taps at times. It has always eventually worked, though, so again this is more annoying than anything.<br /><br />All in all Rio is the best of the AB games so far: flashier, angrier, and birdier than ever.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am an Angry Birds fan and I'm very happy to have this new version. Flawless! Using EVO<br />it is very much addictive and fun.<br />I love th music as well :)
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is another great instalment of the series. Very smooth  play and graphics, a noticeable difference from the last. The lack of ads (temporary) is fantastic.<br /><br />The two problems I have with it are related....the sole availability through amazon, and the hassle it takes to instal the amazon app store and allow it to install....much rather just go through the native android app market.<br /><br />Droid X
B002NXSRVG|2.0|How novel, a movie about a toy.  Why does that premise sound so silly?<br /><br />Talk about overkill!  Yeah it sparkled, all glitzy with gizmos and explosions and nasty nano-green goo and explosions and fire and....did I mention explosions?  I suppose they thought that if they kept things moving at a heady clip no one would notice there wasn't any substance beneath the KABOOM!  That all the actors were subordinate to the action and the, well, toy weapons and whatnot.  They really didn't need actors, they could have gotten by with robots (there was that one guy you couldn't see beneath his suit, didn't say a word, which was a blessing considering the dialog involved, was he a robot?  Couldn't tell.).  And then there was Sergeant Stone, aptly named, that I thought was...then told myself it couldn't be, was that Brendan Fraser?  Blinked and he was gone.  Why was he there, I forget.  This is one movie you could never spoil in the telling because who can remember what just happened?<br />My synopsis of the movie: there were a lot of explosions.<br />Even riddled with the occasional flashback (which served only to confuse matters), there wasn't much in the way of humanity involved here.  Tough talking, macho posturing (especially by THE Baroness, Sienna Miller), withering putdowns (the obligatory slur, \\"ladies!\\"), toy names (who would name their kid Heavy Duty or Snake Eyes!?), and deliriously impossible combat sequences that everyone seems to survive with barely a scratch (who thinks Storm Shadow won't be back?).<br />By the time The Rise of Cobra had set up its sequel my brain was having spasms, begging them to stop the torture: I'LL TALK!  I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT....No, it wasn't a keeper, and no, I won't be watching the sequel or the one that follows it.  I'd sooner stare at a sparkler for 2 hours.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game looks better the the other versions, and it runs great on my droid 2 global. i would highly recommend this to anyone with a smart phone.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|WOW what can I say, all the reviews here all say what I wanted to say,that this is the best show ever, better then The X Files,better then Lost,and better then every show on TV right now, first you have great writing, every show is a fantastic, GREAT actors, Anna Torv is well amazing, in this season alone she has played s different characters perfectly, one the original Olivia Dunham, then Alt-Olivia Dunham from the other side, and now she is play William Bell, who was played by Leonard Nimoy, but the character died and is now in Olivia's brain,and so Anna Torv is now sounding and acting like Leonard Nimoy and doing a great job, after already play a completely different version of Olivia Dunham, the Alt one, I mean she does it so well you can tell the difference by the way she looks out of her eyes, with out her opening her mouth, or really even doing much,she's just the best actress around today no doubt,and she is Australian too, which means she has to fake a American accent for her two Olivia's and now William Bell too, and she does it so well is almost scary how good she is,and plus she is gorgeous and sexy to boot.Then there's John Noble who plays Dr Walter Bishop, again amazing, he to plays two different versions of the same character, and again very well, there is a huge difference in our Walter and Walternate as we Fringies call him, our Walter is sweet, and kind, even if he is bit odd at times,talking about strange things all the time, he is a bit nutty, but lovable, Walternate has a coldness in his eyes, and is not at all lovable,and you can again tell who is who by there eyes,its wonderful to watch. Then there is Joshua Jackson, who again very good actor, never watched Dawson's Creak, maybe seen a few episodes but never cared for that type of show, so if you didn't care for it ether and decided not to like him because he was in it, that would be not only unfair but stupid too, because he is a very good actor, though he may not be my favorite on the show,I would still miss him if he wasn't in it,the fact is every character and actor on this show is great, even the bad guys are cool in this show, I love the character of Nina Sharp who runs Massive Dynamics, and is plays by Blair Brown also a great actress,she is a very cool character, even has a robotic right arm that looks like a real one,then there's Phillip Broyles, Played by Lance Reddick, another great actor,his character is always cool,and always there for his agents not like Skinner on The X Files,Skinner was wimp, Broyles will stick neck out for his people even giving his life to save another,then there's Astrid Farsworth a young FBI agent who works with and sometimes takes care of Walter, who is played by Jasika Nicole, she too plays tow versions of her character very well, some people put this show down saying it should focus more on just having the character investigate different cases each week, instead of having a on going story line,with romance,and comedy,and twists and turns that make you have to really pay good attention to the show, and stories that is about real stuff not just the weird stuff, but that is why this show is so great is it is not your run of the meal science fiction show,these people are more like real people, not cartoons like in allot science fictions shows, the X Files was like that, every episode was different,it never went with the myth of the show,that show ended after 9 years and never did explain what was really going on, even Gillian Anderson who played Scully admitted later she didn't really understand what had happened, or what it was about,to me it was almost as bad as Lost was, Fringe though is not like that, each episode even the so called stand alone's tie in to the myth of the show, almost all the weird science being used by bad people is something Walter had made and someone stole form him while he was in a mental hospital, so you can't get lost,it really like watching a movie that has 40 some hours long, but instead its a series of one hour shows that just happen to be the best hour on TV, Its right now on FOX at 9pm on Fridays, check it out, if you want to watch older episodes there plenty of sites where you can catch up on it that are free,or just buy seasons one and two here, because I swear on my own life you want be sorry, you will love every episode, and every character and actor on this show, it is addictive its so good! 5 stars for all seasons!!!ts a series of one hour shows that just happen to be the best hour on TV, Its right now on FOX at 9pm on Fridays, check it out, if you want to watch older episodes there plenty of sites where you can catch up on it that are free,or just buy seasons one and two here, because I swear on my own life you want be sorry, you will love every episode, and every character and actor on this show, it is addictive its so good! 5 stars for all seasons!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is awesome. New graphics and scenes are a welcome addition. Instead of getting back at those pigs we are saving our feathered brethren! Lovin' it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|its awesome, but quit bitching, the US got it first, and I'm sure that other countries will get it soon. For AT&amp;T customers, unless you have a custon ROM, your not getting this app store.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The Rio style to an already awesome game makes this one a must have! Well done guys! I am certainly hooked playing level after level .....after level!
0756404738|3.0|Kvothe loses his virginity to a sex fae/goddess.        Typical day for Kvothe.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|great app, lots of fun, very very addicting. i definitely recommend that you get this game, you are almost guaranteed to love it so get it now!
0786868694|5.0|It needs to be said that \\"Bites\\" does feel a bit different from Nigella's other books. It is not as large and was meant more as a companion to the TV Series of the same name (which was one of her best programs.) However, the book is still great and features her wonderful prose as well as some incredible recipes.    The feel of this book is very homey, and there is nothing that is not doable. Though, even the simplest recipes here feel special and not \\"everyday.\\" This is one of Nigella's gifts as a food writer. Sometimes the easiest ideas, executed well, are the best ones. Case in point, this book is filled with recipes that I return to often to the enjoyment of my family and guests.    Some favorites include: Double Potato and Halloumi Bake, Lemon Risotto, Chocolate Fudge Cake, Linguine with Garlic Oil and Pancetta, Salt and Pepper Squid, Thai Yellow Pumpkin and Seafood Curry, Bitter Orange Ice Cream, Lilac/Chocolate Topped Cupcakes, Halloumi with Chilli, Italian Sausages with Lentils, Ginger Jam Bread and Butter Pudding, Aromatic Lamb Shank Stew, Creme Brulee, Warm Shredded Lamb Salad with Pomegranate and Mint, Turkish Delight Syllabub, Creamy Potato Gratin, Sticky Toffee Dessert, and Gingery Hot Duck Salad.    This probably isn't Nigella's most essential book, but the recipes are what count. These are great!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Of all three Angry Birds, this one is the best one yet. You miss the pigs at first, but after you get to the monkeys there is no looking back. Great Fun.
0553582038|4.0|It's no secret that a Feast for Crows is by a large margin generally the least loved novel of the Song of Ice and Fire series (so far). A few things lead to people having this opinion that others have expressed in great detail, so i'll simply note them off as such: Firstly, and usually the strongest source of disdain, is that the book is missing the majority of the most popular POVs (Tyrion, Jon, Dany, etc). In addition to this it features very prominently two POVs that many people find a chore to read (Cersei and Briene) as well as many seeming extraneous POVs that get similar amounts of hate (All those of the Iron Islands and Dorne). Next, coming directly from the insane amount of events that rocked the aSoIaF world in Storm of Swords, this more brooding book can seem lacking in an exciting plot, with characters meandering.   But, of course, one of the main reasons people dislike this book is the fact that it was all there was after Storm for ten years. For anyone who got immersed in the books (and it's obvious many, many people did) the lack of resolutions or even continuations of so much of the plot in this book coupled with waiting year after year for a Dance with Dragons created a lot of negative emotions. Because of the lack of any continuation the decided inconclusive nature of Feast made many dislike it even more.  Now, I understand all these opinions (and heck, I even share a few of them too). But I still loved A Feast for Crows. Hell, it's tied for my favorite aSoIaF book (with Storm, duh). Especially now with Dance so soon to be released it's becoming easier and easier to appreciate all the great qualities of this book. Where others see a slow moving plot, I see great world building; where some hate to read nigh-insane Cersei and \\"boring\\" Brienne I see two of the better characters in the series coming into the limelight. This book is indeed slower than the others, and at times stumbles in execution (the beginning is not up to GRRM's writing abilities, Arya's story is not as captivating as she should be) but Feast has some of Martin's best writing in the entire series. And great events do happen- they're just more subtle then they were in previous books. I'd talk about them here, but I don't want to give spoilers- let's just say many of the reveals are fantastic. And can I mention that both Jaime and Sansa are two of the best POV's in the series?   In the end Feast has aspects that can be frustrating, but I really think the positive vastly outweighs the negatives. And with Dance soon to be arriving at our doorsteps, fulfilling so many of the characters we've been missing and (hopefully) answering many questions we've been asking for years, I think Feast will soon be seen through a new perspective.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|Personally at a low point in my life, this film was perfect to help me with my giddy up.  The point is to be grateful for life and live it.  A very meaningful story.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I'm in the US, so after following several steps, the download proceeded, albeit slowly.  However, I soon found that in order to run the game you need to have Amazon App Market installed.  Furthermore, you must be signed in to that store or the game won't start.  This is unacceptable.  Amazon shouldn't have such conditions on its games.  I've uninstalled both the game and Amazon's store, and I won't return until Amazon changes this policy.
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|I first heard Ms Norman sing the Four Last Songs live at the Festival Hall back in the mid 80s.  Watching this supreme artist simply open her mouth and produce this extraordinarily rich sound, surfing effortlessly over an opulent orchestra, reduced many in the audience to tears.  Her technical mastery is such that you have little sense of the challenge these songs present, with their huge dynamic and vocal range:  the voice gleams through the orchestra, blending perfectly but always present.      This recording captures that tenderness and sweet beauty wonderfully well.  The balance of voice and orchestra is - to my ears anyway - exactly right.  Jessye Norman is one of the great voices of the 20th century, and this recording shows why.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|At first I was disappointed with this series. I have never read the comic, but really enjoy zombie films (to give you an idea I thought I Am Legend was an incredible film). Being that this is television, I got used to the idea that the acting, locations, and effects were not going to live up to Hollywood standards. Eventually, I got sucked into it and have really enjoyed the story line and am starting to believe in the characters enough (and their plight) that I'm really looking forward to season two in the fall.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|the colors and new characters are great. only 2 maps are included though! I played through the game in 2 days of moderate use. unfortunately, no new maps will be available until May 2011. good thing it was free...
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This is an excellent watch with very accurate results. I use it both for jogging and cycling and all of my tracks (including altitude) are correctly mapped. I also like the fact that it records my heart rate during the entire exercise so that I can see it in a graph and see how my fitness is improving. All of the data is sent automatically to Garmin Connect every time I put the watch close to my computer. From there I can export the data using several formats (GPX, Google Earth, etc.). Outstanding device.
1552091090|5.0|This is an awesome, classic kids book.  It is a heart warming story.  I bought quite a few of these and give them with baby shower gifts and write on the inside flap of the book instead of giving cards.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Because it is totally addicting.  I can't stop playing it.  Someone help me please. :-)  My son and I absolutely love this game.  We are both addicted.   Great Job ROVIO!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is an awesome master peace. always impressive. can't wait to see what they come up with next.  5 stars all the way. always fun.
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|Listing in Special Features on the back of the DVD package, it states as included:      Commentary by Film Historian Jeanine Basinger - check    2 insightful documentaries:  New Making-of - check    Featurette - Sergeant Your: Of God and Country and Vintage Biographical Profile - check    Gary Cooper:  American Life, American Legend - check    Classic cartoon:  Porky's Preview - not there - we were looking forward to that
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I find it completely absurd that this game only comes with 2 levels to start and wont be complete until November. Its really not that much better than the original.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just rooted my Nook Color and this is my first Angry Birds. But I made the mistake of letting my wife play it.  Going on two hours now!    What a beautiful game.    Love the Nook and Android.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|beautiful new way to play.  sounds and graphics are huge improvement over earlier angry birds games. working perfectly on thunderbolt on big red network!  even better that it was free!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It is a great app I seriously played it all day today, 5 out of 5, and please rate the apps based on the app not the app store or market, i actually like the second app store or market adds a sense of freedom, not locked down like iPhone
B004FOA84A|4.0|on the simple side - completed in about an hour.  heres hoping the dev will continue with some more difficult gameplay.  graphics were very nice.  gameplay nice and smooth on Thunderbolt.
B001B0AY68|1.0|Terrific movie but don't buy the german import...for one the sellers are obviously ripping off the customer...come on $179.00...you can buy the criterion collection on dvd still or you can wait till the end of april for the blu ray from criterion and only pay close to thirty bucks. There is no directors cut as far as im aware....ive checked both the universal and criterion versions. Both have the same run time as does this import. Maybe there was footage not shown in german theaters that has been placed back into the german release of the film.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|There are many similar games out there and the only reason I can think that this one is the most popular is simply hype. But it is very fun and a great way to kill time. Nice that a mobile game has a story and cut-scenes. Its also a polished app in the sense it has settings which actually work. Also nice that by default the bulk of the data is installed on the SD card, if you have one. Even so its only 2.5 megs in your RAM which is darn good for a pretty and well made mobile game.     If you were lucky enough to get Rio when it was free I congratulate you. If you like demolition games and want to kill many hours on your Android device, I still think its worth the 99 cents.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i use it daily to do things like voice memos, ammend study notes and capture free floating idea..  for the individual trying to compute in a cloud environment this app is indespensible.  my notes are with me from one device to another and the changes are all in sync.
B0033PSH4U|5.0|Great movie.  From what I understand, the DVD isn't even in production anymore.  Buy it while you have the chance.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|Read an article about this gal being a modern \\"Edith Piaf\\" and boy were they not far off.  Zaz can SING...big time...a very nice jazzy, big band-ish, bluesy, folky blend.  Powerful, expressive, and emotive articulation with skilled vocal control that she makes seem too easy.  That combined with that smoky colored timbre of her voice is just amazing.    I actually bought this for my wife who's a big \\"Edit Piaf\\" fan, and I was kind of surprised by how much I liked it.  YES, shockingly she sings in French, most likely because she IS French.  Mixed with mostly simple instrumentation (acoustic guitar, contrabass, accordion, etc) this REALLY makes for an enjoyable and energetic listen.    Doesn't matter if vous parlez français or not, because after listening to this for a couple weeks, you'll probably be singing LOUDLY in mangled French as you bop around the house doing whatever...the music is seriously just that infectious.  Check her out on You Tube...that's what convinced me she was worth the one-click.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Initially installed on my Droid X following all the instructions and had an idea and installed it on Nook Color and it was smoothly installed. I am not that much into game but greatly appreciate the open nature of Android system and now we have more choices/options in the form of Amazon AppStore. Nice!!!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Kind of a rip off because you need to install the Amazon apps program on your device first in order to get the game.  I just want the apk file to install on a tablet without the extra overhead of the Amazon apps Store.  It's cheaper to spend $.99 cents if you can just download the game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|More of the same yet all new. Must have first app from Amazon App Store. Keep the updates coming Android market did that very well.
B00005OAE6|5.0|Better album than \\"Night Moves.\\"  Probably right up there with \\"Mongrel\\" and \\"Seven\\" as a top Seger purchase.  The tunes are instantly familiar and contain hooks galore.  Seger gets introspective, but rocks out even still and remains dedicated to searing rock as well as singer/songwriter balladry.  The first five songs are amongst the most recognizable Seger compositions, and these are followed by \\"We've Got Tonight,\\" one of his biggest hits.  Folks, this is the perfect place to start to become acquainted with the music of Bob Seger-even over a compilation (well, any of the currently available ones, anyway.)
0066620996|5.0|This book becomes one of my best collections on my book shelf. As a business owner, I appreciated author's practical teaching on how to become a good business owner. I will pass this book to my son and my friends so that more people will benefit from it. This is not a book. This a must read book if you are serious in business.
B0009IW98O|3.0|Fair album.  Many of the albums on either side of this are a bit stronger, because the artist felt the need to release a covers album.  His covers aren't the best covers in the world, but they are ok and somewhat stronger than the originals featured on this CD.  \\"Someday\\" is not a strong original, but \\"Bo Diddley\\" is a great cover version of an already amazing song.  \\"Let it Rock\\" seems to dwarf Seger's own \\"Heavy Music,\\" which is featured here in its original 1966 lo-fi version.  Out of place, the track is worthwhile, but would be better served on a compilation.  Some of the highlights of this album are featured on \\"Early Seger,\\" and rightfully so-\\"Carpenter\\" contains a great Seger vocal.  Missing, though, from \\"Early Seger\\" is \\"Bo Diddley,\\" and the searing \\"Let it Rock,\\" which was bettered on \\"Live Bullet.\\"  Mixed bag, but not bad.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This game works great on both my HTC Thunderbolt and original droid. The game is not much different from the Angry Bird's typical formula, but that is a good thing.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Mamoru Hosoda followed up his Academy Award-winning sci-fi shojo movie of The Girl Who Leapt Through Time with an extended remake of his original Digimon short movie(which was the second chapter in the American release of Digimon: The Movie). Summer Wars is a full-length feature blending in high school romance with digital armageddon.<br /><br />At the beginning of summer vacation in Japan, math whiz Kenji is working with his buddy Takashi as a moderator for the massive online network called OZ(no Wizard Of Oz puns present)which is a virtual world similar to WOW, but with less of a midevil setting and more like playful icons involved in fighter tournaments. Kenji's cute energetic classmate Natsuki offers him another quick job to help her prepare for her great-gramma's 90th birthday. He accepts, and the two of them go off to Natsuki's family estate in the country. They are a large and diverse family descended from a samurai clan, and the great-grandmother Sakae is about everything you'd be looking for in granny. Kenji is shocked though when Natsuki claims to her family that he is her boyfriend, but she says that in order to make her grandma feel safe about her. Confused during the night, he gets a strange text message send in code, which he uses his math skills to crack, and sends it back. He awakes the next morning to see on the news that OZ has been been hacked into and that he is being blamed for it. It turns out that an A.I. program masquerading as Kenji's avatar, calling itself Love Machine. It proceeds to take over OZ, which Kenji tries to stop with a new avatar Takashi made for him, along with Natsuki's cousin who is really the brilliant game fighter, King Kazma. They tangle with Love Machine, but after absorbing a few other avatars, it goes all Super-Saiyan and kicks them out of the system. It then proceeds to infect computer systems all over the world, causing mass confusion and hysteria. Its later revealed that Natsuki's estranged uncle is the one who actually created the A.I. that the American military try to use, but it escaped into OZ. This news infuriates Sakae as she banishes him from her home. The ensuing action causes Sakae to pass away in her sleep. The family believes that Love Machine is responsible, so they pull all the stops to try and pull the plug on it. They call in resouces from all over the country, even by bringing in a huge supercomputer to back them up. Natsuki uses her superior skills at tea ceremony card playing to challenge Love Machine to a final card game. She gets help from players all over the world to shut him down. However, it causes a satellite to begin falling towards their location. Kenji hacks into the satellite's system, and has it crash near the estate.<br /><br />Summer Wars features some impressive digital effects, specifically in the online world, although you sorta wish there was more added to it than the cartoonish avatars. The style used for the offline parts are a little more standard, at least for a generic non-Ghibli anime movie. The main appeal for this movie though is the compelling story, and the tightnit seperate world the family of characters exist in. They're very believable, despite some of the standard anime tropes that are present, and you can recognize at least one member of your own family in Natsuki's. This film makes for a great watch, at least as a gateway anime since it takes alot of what makes for a great story and an engaging syle.ted the A.I. that the American military try to use, but it escaped into OZ.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you liked the original Angry Birds, you'll absolutely love Rio!  Smoother gameplay, better graphics, and just a more polished feel.  A must have game for any mobile device!
B004SBX112|5.0|I'm loving this paid version. The horrible lag of the free, ad supported version is gone.<br />The graphics are beautiful and it's just a really fun game.
0545265355|2.0|So I'm going to buck the trend and give this series a fairly negative review. But before I do let me stress that for a teenage girl these are probably 5-star books. For anyone else, especially for an adult, these books leave much to be desired. These books are definitely NOT \\"enjoyable by both kids and adults\\" as other reviews have claimed.<br /><br />Teenage girls will dig the love triangle and the way the main character, Katniss, wallows in her misery. Sure, they will appreciate Katniss' self-reliance but that will come as a distant third to the first two features. They will also no doubt find themselves captivated by the twists and turns of the plot.<br /><br />But for most adults there won't be one plot twist they won't see coming a mile away.  They will have figured things out long before the main character does, making the character's growth rather tedious, they will find the underlying premise to be politically sophomoric, and will probably find themselves getting distracted from the story by questions about what's going on in the rest of the world.<br /><br />So if you have a friend with a 13-year old daughter who likes to read, this series could be a good gift for her. But for the rest of you out there, there are far better ways to spend your time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Very smooth and great next episode of Angry Birds.    Hope that the new levels will arrive soon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i miss the pigs but just as fun - no prob on droidx - easy down load - hate the twenty five word requirement for this opinion block - dont think i will leave another comment
B004SBQGHS|5.0|had the free version, bought this, didn't have to start over just removes the ads, well worth the 99 cents. oh yeah, those piggies are going down..ha ha, HTC EVO 4G
B003EV6DBM|3.0|While Matt Smith is not my favorite Doctor, he does a credible job in the role. Karen Gillan is great as a feisty, assertive companion. The new Tardis is over-the-top.<br /><br />What the DVD set lacks are the bonus touches that I expected. I don't need video-in-video commentaries on one episode per disc; I want commentaries on all the episodes, as had been done for the previous series. Who needs to see the assembled commentators, really? I was hoping to get insights into my favorite episodes (Lodger and Vincent van Gogh), but sadly, neither of these were chosen for the video-in-video commentaries.<br /><br />I also wish they'd put the episodic Confidential files on the same disc as the episode they're talking about, so I can watch the episode and then see the Confidential about it without having to change discs. They'd certainly have had the room for them if they'd left off those vid-in-vid bits. :)
B004SBX112|5.0|yes my friends, i too had the free version, bought this for 99 cents, and did not lose any of my progress. well worth it to remove the ads, just perfect. HTC EVO 4G....
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|This is such a fun game! The graphics are cool and I love the way you can feel the reel and pull of the fish. I had someone ask what I was playing the other day while on the train because I was having a battle for a large tuna and is what awesome. Well done!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Like almost everyone else mentioned, the ads-free Angry Birds Rio runs much more smoothly and the updated graphics are nice! My only wish is that those updates for new levels would come faster.
B0045EJY90|5.0|This is very solid, well built player. My cds sounds so perfect now. I do not have an Ipod yet, so I have not pluged one in yet. The sound does seem better than using a DVD player. Amazon did a real good job, with fast service. I'll sure buy from them again.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|This edition is missing THE main plot of the story. Every time there is a letter or a newspaper article that is read (which anyone who reads Sherlock Holmes knows is a common device), it is skipped in the text entirely. This isn't even a good deal for free!
B002BSHWUU|4.0|There has been alot of talk about these Beatles cds, why they were not remixed and it would take another twenty years for this to happen. I decided to try to remix these songs myself. I pluged in a headphone plug to my Denon surround reciever, with a mini jack pluged to it, with a RCA patch plug, that I pluged into my cd recorder, with the the reciever on the two channel surround field and recorded Rubber Soul thru Magical Mystery Tour and the first half of past masters vol. 2. I have to say the remixing turned out real good. It gave it a fuller even sound, while retaining the stereo effect. Listening thru headphones is a real treat now. Paperback Writer sounds so good now. If I hear the Beatles the old way, it sounds so strange now. I have been listning to remixes alot and now I can listen to the Beatles much more. The Rubber Soul sounds the best remixed from the mono origanal stereo set. The rest of the Beatle albums I Left them alone alone because they sound just fine. The First two albums sound the best in mono. Now I don't have to waite for the remixing anymore.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazon said it was compatible with the LG Ally, but it ended up crashing my phone twice. A popup on my phone told me to reinstall the app. It successfully reinstalled but then sent my phone into a boot-loop when I tried to run it. Thanks for getting my hopes up Amazon.
0061726826|2.0|I know that I'm one of the few people who aren't liking this book, but I'm risking going against the grain because I really can't understand all of the rave reviews.  The writing is great, but the book is slow.  I was going to push through it and wait until the end to review it, but I just learned that it's a trilogy, and I'm not sure it's going to be worth forcing my way through it knowing that I'll have to read books 2 and 3 in order to get the whole story.  (As a side note, why does EVERYTHING have to be a trilogy these days?  Is it for marketing reasons?  Most stories only need one book in order to get the point across, and everything else just ruins the impact of the first installment.  Maggie Stiefwater, I'm looking at you.)    So anyway... in case I can't finish, I'm going to say now what I don't like about this book.  As a couple of other reviewers have said, this is simply not an effective dystopian novel.  In order to create a powerful dystopia, the author must convey to the reader that the world she describes could evolve out of current science and social or political trends.  That's what makes a dystopia frightening and what makes the reader think... the point of the dystopian genre is to get the audience to consider what will happen to us if we continue down the road we're traveling now.    Lauren Oliver fails at this.  In fact, I don't get the sense that she even attempted to do this or that she has any concept of the dystopian genre other than that it describes a society that is \\"bad.\\"  I feel no connection to the world described in the book.  I can't imagine any society evolving to the point of eradicating love, of all things, so I can't take it seriously and it's having no impact on me. There's little discussion of the \\"science\\" behind being able to \\"cure\\" love, and I need a hefty dose of fringe science in my dystopian novels in order to make them believable.  It's also unrealistic to think that most kids wouldn't have the experience of falling in love before the age of 18.  I mean, duh. I don't care how much brainwashing they've undergone.  Kids today are having sex at 12 and 13.  Whatever.  As for any \\"lessons\\" that might come out of a story about messing with people's brains and emotions (i.e. the side effects of eradicating things like friendship, sexual preference, familial love, and even a passion for work or hobbies, which to the author's credit are at least given nominal mention a few chapters into the book) - well, I think America actually *learned* all those lessons during the period in which we lobotomized thousands of mentally ill, depressed, and anxious patients, insomniacs, and people with learning disabilities.  The book has a been there, done that feel to me, and I feel no emotional connection and none of the terror that comes with a truly powerful dystopia (for example, Brave New World, We, 1984, The Handmaid's Tale, Oryx and Crake, Lord of the Flies, and more recently, the Hunger Games and Across the Universe.)    It seems to me that the \\"dystopian\\" element in this novel is just a convenient way to set up the same old tired \\"Bella and Edward rebel against a world that can't understand their super speshul relationship\\" story.  If you like that type of story, this book is for you.  If you're considering picking up this book because you like dystopian or speculative fiction, then there are plenty of better places to look.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it loads fine and plays great. I like the new look of it too, more of a rewarding end to levels . A ViewSonic G tablet is the device I'm using.
B000001AFY|5.0|This album was a favourite more than 30 years ago and hasn't lost any of its magic! A marvellous collection of Diana at her very best!! A must have for every fan of Diana or of good soul music! Each song is a jewel of its own, and this album also includes the original long version of \\"Love hangover\\" which is not found on all those \\"best of\\"/greatest hits etc. selections!
B001ECDVYK|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband, who is a big Quentin Tarantino fan.  This was the only movie of his that my husband had not yet seen.    He could not stop telling me about it after he finished watching it.  He especially loved the look of the movie as well as the storyline.  We just recently bought a blu-ray player, and he was really excited with how it looked on our TV.  All in all, a purchase well worth it!
B003ELKNH2|5.0|This movie was much better than the original as seen in the movie theaters.  The story line was smooth and without the cut and paste of the theatre version.  Anyone who lived during the Vietnam era sees the true story of the many conflicts of politics and the way that war is normally conducted as it was during the second and first world wars.  Clearly showing the corruption in the Vietnamese government and the conflicted emotions of the average combat soldier caught up in a war that the politicians refused to let America win.  This film is the best to come out of the Vietnam war.  I recommend it highly to anyone who served, or who wants to understand the futility of allowing politics dictate how a war should be fought.  We need to look at Vietnam as the poster child of future conflicts such as Afganistan, and why we weren't able to win.  Clearly, it illustrates the futility of a war governed by Politicians and not Generals.
B000002GXS|5.0|This may or may not fit the classic definition of a \\"concept\\" album, but there is a sense of cohesion that makes me view it that way.    I was very, very fortunate to see a solo Tom Waits opening for Frank Zappa at the late, legendary Circle Star Theater in San Carlos CA shortly after the release of his first album. I believed then, as I do now, that he was most successful in an extreme, stripped-down, bare-bones, raw nerve environment. That night it was just Tom, a revolving stage, an electric piano, and his songs.    By the time of \\"Heart of Saturday Night,\\" Tom had grown as a songwriter and performer. The album's concept, if you will...which weaves its way in and out of the fabric of every song...is the eternal \\"outsider,\\" stuck on the inside, trying to find a place to fit in and understanding the futility of that goal.    This is another album in which track-by-track analysis is pointless...every song is excellent, a 41 minute tribute to not wanting to go home alone while knowing that's exactly how the night's going to play out. The album just kicks into immediate high gear with \\"New Coat Of Paint\\" (\\"We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon, in that burgundy sky\\").    Other reviewers have mentioned the changes in Tom's style over the years, but when I listen to this album, I don't see it that way...\\"Heart of Saturday Night\\" was, and continues to be, a single unique moment in his career...he simply does not have any other album like this, but he has other albums that are similar.    If you can imagine a classic album like Frank Sinatra's [[ASIN:B000006OHF Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely]] filtered through the sensibilities of a bourbon-soaked, chain-smoking beat poet, you have a good idea of what this one's all about. Magnificent, a classic. Buy it.
B004GF244K|5.0|Amazon's editors will no doubt catch and correct this, but the film is certainly in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.      My girlfriend and I watch this frequently, and weep at the end every time.  You'll love it.  Wish I had it in BD, but the DVD looks and sounds great too.  What a gem.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like it and no issues so far. This 25 word limit is pretty annoying. so ya, just a couple more words and I can hit submit.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rovio did it again. Better graphics, sound, music, and physics are all here with the same great formula. Very addictive. I like the amazon appstore as well. Classic! EVO 4G
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Well....i would love to review this game..but even though it is free, i have an amazon account and a compatible android phone, their is geographical apartheid in place... I wasted 10 minutes of my life trying to get access to this app and for having the audacity of not living stateside (like most of the worlds population) i am artificially obstructed from accessing this app...  The company is finnish so as they say in the us 'go figure'    Not a happy bunny
B004SBS8LA|4.0|(Droid 2 - Chicago, Illinois) Trying to download from the Amazon App was a pain, and took two days to finally accomplish. I didn't like how I had to change my security settings to let unknown apps install their software. I changed my settings back immediately after downloading so that nothing else could in the future. You still have to enable the 1-click pay even though the app is free. Once you \\"purchase\\" the app, you then have to go in and download it. I tried downloading the Appstore first on my phone, then trying to install Rio, but it was hard to do everything on my phone. You can \\"purchase\\" this right through Amazon, and then have it download onto your phone (although you still need to download the AppStore App if you do it this route too).  This seemed to be the quicker way to do it since I was already logged into Amazon and my credit card information was stored as well. It took a while to download, but finally did and I am excited to play it.
0446556750|3.0|I've read this book twice now. The 2nd time was be accident. That's how memorable this story was.<br /><br />It's not a good book but it's not a bad book either. Connelly is searching with this book. I suspect he had a contract obligation to meet and had to get this one to the publisher. He's a good enough writer that he almost pulled it off. Almost.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|well i have a rooted nook color and this game looks so amazing its much faster and smoother than the current updated angry bird seasons. but the best part is that this is the best way to start an app store
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I have been listening to Cheap $5-20 ear buds and Panasonic lightweight headphones my entire life.  I purchased a pair of Skull Candy, over the ear headphones last year and really appreciated the step up in performance over what I had been using previously.  Unfortunately the Skull Candy headphones snapped in half over my big melon in a little less than a year of light to moderate use.<br /><br />I decided to step it up and purchase a set of these and think it was the best hundred bucks I have ever spent.  If you love sitting and listening to music for hours at a time then you owe it to yourself to pick up a pair of these sweet things.<br /><br />They sounded great right out of the box.  After about 2 months of listening to them nearly every day for multiple hours they sound even better.<br /><br />I should note that I was almost scared away by a few highly rated reviews on Amazon.  One stated the comfort was inferior.  I couldn't disagree more.  I have a huge head (6' 4\\" 260lbs) and they fit me great!  I enjoy 2-3 hour sessions 4-5 days a week now.  A few others mentioned something about these headphones having a, \\"neutral\\" sound to them.  They went on to suggest people who were looking for an improved sound should look elsewhere.  I'm not sure what a neutral sound is, but these are anything but neutral sounding for me.  I hear all the instruments much more vividly now.  Everything is much more clear, including voices.  The best way I can describe it is that it sounds like I'm in the studio listening to the band record.<br /><br />I can't believe I waited so long to grow, er..., get, a pair.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I wish this app was on the google market where there is no problems at all. I installed the amazon app just to download angry birds rio but now that I cant, forget about this app and the amazon market app too
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If your on AT&amp;T that's your problem that you decided to go with the worst carrier in existence. I'm sure this will go international at some point but because it doesn't work in your country doesn't make it a bad game.  I love amazon but hate the idea of having two app stores. It just isn't needed. I did download this game and the game itself looks and runs great so that is what I am reviewing. The graphics are updated as well as the animations the game runs and looks fantastic. rooted evo
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I don't have att, and every time I try to install it says there is no room on my phone, but there is plenty of room! Help!
B000654YRY|3.0|Video good.  Audio good, but 1) 5.1 would have been better and 2) lead singer's voice was muffled and words almost impossible to understand - almost like a foreign language.  Missing many of the hits I'd like to have heard.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|As much as I liked the first Ip Man release, #2 is even better! Ip Man 2 rivals other great films like \\"Rocky\\", with a stand-up-and-cheer boxing match at the end of both films.    The only problem I had with this film is that Donnie Yen smokes several times in the film. A true martial arts master would NEVER put tobacco drug poisons into his body.    Other than that faux pax, this is a film no one should miss. Outstanding!
0756404738|5.0|I was worried at first when I read the reviews.  People complained about how he was stuck at the University for too long, how the bad guys were still mysterious, and how Denna was mean.  Well to me that's what was so incredible about it.  Had Patrick Rothfuss written a book with everything that we wanted in it, the bad guy losing and the boy gets the girl within a span of a year..then what story would that be?  It would be the same lame fairy-tale we've all heard.<br />Kvothe even said in the book that this was no spun tale but his life..so yes things arent going to go great for him but because of this the book made me think, worry, love, and imagine.  If you're expecting a hum-drum tale, stop, this..this is original.
B00005AR3G|5.0|For whatever reasons unknown to me,an adult,I LOVE this movie! I think all the underlying humor  is totally missed by the kids. The DVD itself played w/o a problem. It also came in record time.
B001IF252M|1.0|** I bought mine from xcessbuy; the following review MIGHT not apply to the other sellers... But be aware there are knockoffs out there! **    I bought this hoping it would be the official Apple one; but alas, it is a knockoff. This is only obvious when you put it next to the real thing and it's visibly wider and with a longer, cheaper-made cord than the official Apple adapter. But in functionality, you might have problems and I would advise you to rethink risking your money to save a few dollars.    Part of the VGA standard is that devices can transfer an EDID, an identifier telling the computer about the screen's possible resolutions and so on. Some displays do not transfer this EDID; usually they are older, but sometimes this is done on purpose, for example the projectors at my school do not send the EDID on purpose (according to the IT guy).    Why does this matter? The knockoff cable won't detect a screen if it doesn't send an EDID. I bought this for the specific purpose of presenting in my classes, only to find it didn't detect the projector. I went home and it worked on my Dell LCD monitor (it's pretty old) and my little Toshiba TV (I think 18\\"). The firmware update mentioned in another comment didn't detect this adapter at all because it's a fake; looking in System Profiler, the knockoff's firmware version is \\"0.00\\" so it doesn't even pretend to be an official Apple one.    I still needed to hook my MBP to the projectors at school, so I broke down and drove to my local Apple store, where I purchased a real MB572Z/A adapter. I then went straight to a classroom to try it, and it worked flawlessly with the projector system. I double-checked and indeed the knockoff did nothing and the Apple adapter just worked, every time.    I didn't bother trying to return this knockoff cord, I'll keep it for use at home and then use the Apple one everywhere else. But I learned my lesson... In trying to save a few dollars, I ended up wasting money and having to buy the real thing in the end. Don't make the same mistake. Just buy the real thing straight from Apple, unless you know for sure that your screens send the EDID.    (MacBook Pro 17\\" mid-2010)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i dont understand why people are giving this app 1 star....this game is awesome and free. get over it you have to download the amazon app. wow...you have more options...i thought this was america not china.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like the angry bird games because they are free and they are constantly updating the games and giving you more and more levels.  I can't wait to see what they will come up with next.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|just love this game. its quite different from the other versions where u rescue other animals instead of taking out the pigs. also love the new 3d bckgrounds and animations.
075666733X|5.0|I am a substitute teacher and I was teaching a high school health class when I came across the '07'version. I found it to be so informative and well illustrated that I just had to have it. When I checked on the price at Amazon I discovered the 2010 addition and decided to order it. The newer version is worth the extra few dollars difference in cost over the older version.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The new graphics are phenomenal. That you could change the whole thing and keep the birds good n' angry is a testament to your collective creativity. Bravo. Looking forward to updates! Sprint EVO 4G...GREAT
B0010V5SW8|4.0|This movie is nothing like the poem, with the exception of the main characters. I love how they told the story the same way the Norsemen might have done, centuries before it was written down by monks. You can just imagine why the poem seemed to be lacking the details that make this story great to the imagination. Motion capture in this film is great, and if you have a 3D TV. this is not to be missed. Great retelling of a classic. Even though some fans of the poem might not like it, (because it doesn't stick to the poem) I believe that if you just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is you'll understand where the creators of this screenplay were coming from. In case you do not by now, I really recommend this movie.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Like the title says, I got the disk within a week of ordering it and it came to me like new.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app is perfect on a us cellular samsung mesmerize...love the new birds. Can't wait to see what is next. I am an angry bird fan for life.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I read books to relax and change my mind, to get away from the negative world and enjoy a more funny or positive look at life and this book gave me exactly that. This book made me smile and laugh out loud very easily. It was also easy to read and a page turner for me. I couldn't wait to come back home from work to plunge back in Emma's world.  The story was sometimes predictive and sometimes clich&eacute;, but the surprises are all in the way the story developped and how it was written... which I found very entertaining. I'll be reading more of Sophie Kinsella's books.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The game play looks amazing.  Game I think is more fun then normal angry birds. Only down side is that it is a big drain on the battery.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|tried to install on Atrix but ATT is not allowing the amazon app store, get that fixed and I'll rare better but not being able to download anything from the largest carrier in the country is total BS.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It feels and plays great on my Nexus S, the game offers the same complex settings like Seasons and the original Angry Birds, but with a lot smoother performance and with the same great graphics.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I absolutely love this new angry birds game. It is the best one yet in my opinion. It is also the new favorite of my 7 year old who is a big angry birds fan. He loves the second stage with the monkeys.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This asp is wonderful. The version availability us unparalleled! Ut is super user friendly and my favorite app by far as it is the word of the Lord.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Beautiful graphics! New locales with rich landscapes. More of the game you know you love. What are you reading comments for? Download now! Flawless on the G2 &amp; Tbolt
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have tried on several occasions to download this to my phone and each time it fails. Will  not load on my Droid X dont know if its a bad app or what
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have one of the first Android phones.  Phone came out in 2009. Thought for sure this would not work on my phone, but much to my surprise it works great.<br /><br />I have a Samsung Moment.  Android version 2.1 Update 1.  No hacks or the like done on my phone.<br /><br />Game is awesome. Most pleased.
0920668372|5.0|I can still remember my mother reading this to me. A \\"Must Have\\" childrens book. I will start reading it to my daughter very soon!
B004LSJCJM|5.0|This cd is great.  His best so far.  Joe Bonamassa is the greatest guitar player alive today.  All you have to do to know this is see him live.  I have seen two of his tours, the last one being two weeks ago.  The man is truly amazing.  His guitar playing has never been better and his voice just seems to be getting stronger with the years.  I think Dust Bowl is truly a classic.  I love the material and where he seems to be going with it.  The people giving this cd average reviews must not be listening to the same cd I am or they had too much hip hop for lunch.  As for the blues people, give it up.  Joe still does blues but there is more to him than just blues.  The rock numbers on this cd are great and as I said before, I like where he is going with this music.  \\"Dust Bowl\\", \\"Black Lung Heartache\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"No Love on the Street\\" and \\"Prisoner\\" are all great songs and \\"The Whale That Swallowed Jonah\\" is one of the best rock songs I have heard in years.  Admittedly, the two weak songs on the cd are the ones he does with John Hiatt and Vince Gill, but hey even The Beatles had weak songs.<br />Dust Bowl is a fresh breath of great music and Joe is a great talent.  My compliments, Joe, keep up the good work.  I will be listening in the future and I am looking forward to seeing you live for the third time.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|yo he amado a ricky toda mi vida,tengo sus discos y este ultimo es indiscutiblemente excelente,lo recomiendo; ricky es simplemente maravilloso
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i agree with what everyone else is saying...better graphics and sound. I enjoy the change from pummeling the pigs to setting birds loose instead. Its rather annoying that this is getting so many 1 stars because of people complaining the appstore doesnt work in their country. dont rate angry birds because of amazon. go to the market and rate the appstore.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It's as simple as that.  The App Store told me it was compatible with my phone, so I got it and it won't even load.  Good thing it was free!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The best version of Angry Birds to date. Instead of killing pigs, you're rescuing birds, which is far more entertaining.  The only downside is the monkeys. What is that Rovio? Really? But other than that, I love the game, and I love that the new Amazon App Store was able to bring it to me. Thank you Rovio and Amazon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Amazon's jump into the App Store business is a good first effort. What better way to get people to download their app store than to offer an exclusive new free version of angry birds? The graphics are improved and runs beautifully on my DInc running CM7.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game!!!!!  Very entertaining!!!!!  Would purchase all versions!!  Glad to be rid of annoying misplaced ads in this paid version.  Definitely a #1 app!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|rio is a fancy angry birds experience. smooth animations, great music, and no pigs. overall its a step up and a step in the right direction.  Paid version is great and now all angry birds games are available paid, no ads makes for more fun.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds was good before and now that it is ad-free, it is the best thing to happen to Android users! Congratulations Rovio with your great product.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like this much better than the Angry Birds that came on my Droid Global. It's fast, colorful, challenging. I'm giving it a 5 because it's the best game I've found so far on my smart phone. I got this free, but would have willingly paid $.99 or $1.99 for it. What I would really like to have is a great solitaire game such as the one I have on my PDA that has hundreds of different solitaire games.
B002GJU54E|3.0|First of all I've read all of the Stephanie Plum 'Numbers' books and love them.  However, for some reason, while reading this book I felt that while it had the same characters as the other books, it had been written by someone else.  This book just does not hold up to the quality of Janet Evanovich's other books.  I have to admit, unlike some other reviewers, I liked Carl the Monkey.  In fact he was my favorite character in this book.  I love Lulu, but unfortunately she only makes sporadic appearances in this book and just doesn't seem like her usual, goodhearted, but crazy self. Most of her dialogue was centered on eating and less on Tank.  Grandma Mazure only appeared in one short paragraph and I missed her.  Ranger's role was limited in this book as was Morelli's.  I would have liked to have seen more of Ranger and less of Diesel.  For some reason the Diesel character just did not appeal to me  The secondary characters in this book were too unrealistic to be believed.  They included a fire farter, Sasquatch, and a retired Easter Bunny.  They were not entertaining and I could have done without them.  There is enough real craziness out there which would have been far more amusing than these characters were.  I didn't even care about the villans and if they were captured or not.  One is a scientific genius who is small and for some reason wears children's t-shirts and attempts to rape Stephanie twice.  The other is Wulf who disappears in a flash of fire.  I would have liked to have seen him team up with the fire farter.  That would have been funny.    With that said, the book wasn't horrible.  I was fortunate to find it for $6.00 but would have never paid any more than that.  The story is light reading, I enjoyed the monkey, and for a few days it was a nice distraction.  Other than that it didn't have a lot going for it and I hope the next Stephanie Plum book is a lot better.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I wish Rovio would quit updating Angry Birds!  Too addicting!! twenty five words words words words words words words words words words words words words
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why is it US only? Can't you at least prepare everything for an International launch?  I was looking forward to using the appstore but I don't understand this.   discrimination much?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the Angry Birds series! Well, its more of a love hate relationship,as its both enjoyable and frustrating at the same time. The evil pigs from Angry Birds, and Seasons mock me in my sleep. Evil swine! Now with Rio we have new evil to overcome. Bring on more Angry Birds! I like so many others am addicted.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rio is a bit different from the standard angry birds but it is still awesome. Worth the download and worth the price. Honestly if you like angry birds you shouldn't be reading reviews you should be playing t this game!
014241493X|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of John Green first of all, so reading his book is just awesome to start off with. But this is the fisrt of his books that I have read and honestly, I fudging love it. Margo starts out to look like a normal preppy person but then she is so kick butt and weird and just awesome. And Ben is so hilarious and Q is just... epic. Actually I cant place words that make the right review for this book :)
B004KD5TQI|5.0|This soundtrack is brilliant.  Psychadelic rock tunes abound, and all have been expertly produced to fit the movie's dark mood.  The cast does an amazing job at performing these songs (Emily Browning sings three and some other cast members sing another).  It also includes some brilliant remixes of songs by their original artists.  Throughout this very short soundtrack album I can honestly say not one track is skippable.  All of them are mesmerizing!  In particular, however, \\"Army of Me\\", \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" are very notable.    This is definitely a soundtrack worth checking out!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Bought this game by accident but ended up playing for over an hour.  The concept is simple, and the game is repetitive. Swipe your fingers across the screen to slash fruit. Don't slash the bombs.  There are three modes - classic (game ends once you miss 3 fruit or slash a bomb), zen (no bombs, 90s time limit), and arcade (bombs deduct points, special bananas enhance the game in different ways, 60s time limit).  As you play, you can unlock different blades (different visual effects as you slash fruit) and backgrounds.   I liked the graphics and found the game addicting. I kept playing until I unlocked all the blades and backgrounds. However, by the time I unlocked them all, I got bored and stopped wanting to play.

B000002GKT|5.0|The Pie Rockin' the Fillmore is an excellent live album from the period and is a wonderful complement to their '69 live album from the Whisky A-Go-Go.  Those of us who love live rock had an incredible run for a few years.  Imagine being marooned on an island in the South Pacific with an mp3 player - - and a solar charger - - with this streak of live albums:    1969 - Humble Pie Live at the Whisky A-Go-Go  1970 - Grand Funk Railroad - Live  1970 - The Who - Live at Leeds  1971 - Humble Pie Performance: Rockin' the Fillmore  1972 - Deep Purple - Made in Japan     I'm not sure I'd be looking for any boats on the horizon.  Leave me alone with my music......
0553584537|4.0|I learned a lot from reading this book: procedures for using snipers at crime scenes, district attorney roles, police solidarity, and certain medical issues.  The author gives lots of acknowledgements to people in these vocations, so I have the impression that the information is accurate.    The characters are written believably and with sensitivity to the complexity of wounded personalities.  Common threads run through a number of the characters' life stories that helps them recognize the vulnerability they have in common.  I thought this was a very good depiction of a psychologist/psychiatrist in therapy sessions.  There are a few flaws in the writing.  The most glaring to me is that it wasn't clear how some of the characters knew what they knew when they knew it.    Overall, I enjoyed this book.  It kept me involved to the end, and the scary/gory parts weren't too graphically described.  This would make a good movie script.  I plan to read more written by this author.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I did not expect to see very many changes except for new levels, but out of surprise better graphics and new animations.   Awesome download. Go ahead and try it out.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This movie follows the book really well. Before it came to theaters, I was wondering, \\"Where are they going to cut this movie in half?\\" The ending did seem a little abrupt, but I thought it was a good place to end it. I laughed, I cried (Yes, I literally balled my eyes out in the theater. So did my mom, and she's never read the books or watched the previous movies). She said that it was a little hard to follow because she hadn't read or seen Harry Potter before, but there's not much they can do to backtrack and explain everything or else you'd end up with a movie that's 10 hours long. I'd recommend catching up before watching it, but it definitely doesn't disappoint.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is by far the best angry birds yet. The rest of the angry birds is not even close to as fun as this one...
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The graphics are much improved along with the gameplay.  The oinking pigs are gone, replaced by annoying monkeys and freeing trapped birds from their cages.   \\"Boss\\" battles have been added as well. I would have given it 5 stars, but only two levels to begin with. There are more levels coming, as indicated in the game. Rovio has even gone ahead and outlined what month each new level will come. Great idea!  Thanks to Amazon for giving us this exclusive first day free game! You rock Amazon!    If you are on AT&T and want to get this game, I have one word for you. Root.  Something most everyone should have already done anyway.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have AB and ABS on my Android and AB on my iPod Touch, and this one is by FAR the best yet! Much more advanced graphics and WAY smoother, quicker game play. Gives a whole new life to an already AWESOME series-- A+!
0618918248|4.0|It's a great book, a real insight into the mind of Richard Dawkins and all of his pretentious arrogance. However, he did a wonderful job as painting a photo of religious hysteria. I would not recommend this book to some one who has not yet read anything by the other positions, i.e. Michael Behe 'Darwin's Black Box' or 'Case For A Creator' by Lee Strobel. It's a fantastic book (The God Delusion) and his rebuttal to various authors and religious leaders is outstanding. In summation, if you want to make a fair decision about Gods existence, then do not read this book, if you know where you stand firmly, then it will make you laugh, and will be quite enjoyable.
B002436WFI|2.0|Well, to start off with, if you're not familiar with the underlying book, this will probably have absolutely zero appeal to you.    For fans of the book, this is mostly a let down. Most of the clever, funny, endearing, and amusing scenes from the book have either been excised in the film or just haven't translated to film all that well. It's kind of a pity, because the excellent television adaptation of Hogfather showed that the Discworld can be adapted to screen successfully.    Recommendation: pass, go directly to Hogfather.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great level design and sound effects. Can't understand why this averages three stars right now. Rovio imnovated and took the franchise to the next level. Can't say enough about the ingenious levels. I've played through quite a bit of it but I can't wait to see what's next. A worthy effort.
B004LFO0O2|4.0|This album probably won't please everyone, but who ever wanted to do that anyway? Angles is a pretty even mix of classic Strokes, and experimentation. It's certainly not perfect, and like most of their discography, it requires a bit of mental involvement to really get into a few of the songs. That being said, the Strokes have never put out an album that wasn't solid -- and that's more than a lot of bands can say after more than ten years of activity.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I love this product! It is cute, easy to assemble, and easy to attach to the crib. However, the only problem I have come across is changing the batteries. You have to take it off of the crib, then take off the back panel, and then change the batteries.  My daughter's crib is against the wall, so I have to pull her crib out every time I need to change the batteries. The remote control works great, and the different melodies (or rainforest sounds) are really great. All around, I'd say I would purchase this again!

044654759X|5.0|I have read every Nicholas Sparks book (even the one he wrote with his brother).  I brought Safe Haven with me to read in Jamaica and, like many, couldn't put it down.  a few pages into it I quickly compared it to Sleeping with the Enemy and kept seeing Julia Robert's character straightening the cans in her cupboards and the hand towels in her bathroom.  I very quickly gave in and kept reading.  It turned out to be a fantastic book that ressembles the great movie, but is original in its own way.  It is full of great twists and turn.  I loved it and can't wait to read the next one...what will it be I wonder.  :)
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I won't be purchasing this product because it lacks the original theatrical release. I'm tired of businesses trying to make consumers double dip when it comes to product releasing. We've had to deal with this enough throughout the dvd cycle, I'm really not looking forward to waiting another 4-5 years for something that should have been available from day one.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|If you haven't found the slightly concealed pinpoint \\"entrance\\", then this will only appear to be a frantic, hysterical torrent of impenetrable paranoia. BUT, if you are fortunate or clever enough to decipher the Polish characters \\"instructions\\" at the very beginning of how exactly to \\"enter\\", then it transforms into a thrillingly visceral roller coaster ride through the vast caverns, ornate galleries and cramped cupboards of David Lynch's irresistibly Gothic mind. The story that you then experience -- and it is indeed a profound, shatteringly intense experience -- unfolds with a stunningly vivid, logical rationale.<br /><br />The \\"key\\" is in grasping that David is first requiring us to make a very definite adjustment to our \\"awareness\\", to move towards something like a meditative state where \\"time\\" and \\"space\\" are more fluid, less absolute entities. You MUST release yourself from a strictly literal reading or interpretation of the events and locales and identities, and then somehow, magically, it suddenly makes so much more sense. In fact, it turns out to be Lynch's most intensely sensible creation. That's the perplexing nature of it's remarkable method, its total dependence on the paradoxical quality of its form. Its assimilation of \\"Eastern\\" modes of consciousness in order to reveal a genuinely staggering insight into our \\"Western\\" culture can be seen as a parallel of David's attainment of his own personal enlightenment. David is a long time practitioner of Transcendental Meditation and as such has acquired formidable skill at separating himself from his temporal existence and connecting with an infinitely more intense, more accurate, more valuable reality. He is working in all his art, and especially here, to have us also acquainted with this vast, infinite experience. That's the reason for the seemingly impossible structure, and the secret to gaining entrance. At first attempt I didn't understand how to \\"enter\\" and I was frustrated, perplexed, pissed off with David's seemingly arrogant self involvement. But I thought, \\"No, I must be missing something...\\" so I went back to the beginning and that's when I discovered the barely concealed directions for gaining entry.<br /><br />You may be one of those Lynch fan's that believes that it is intentionally irrational, obtuse and inscrutable, and not in any way meant to be rational, but are non the less impressed and complimentary. Well, unfortunately you have not experienced the real \\"inner\\" story and should go back and try again. Unless your experience is remarkably lucid, and intensely coherent, and thoroughly devastating, then you've not gotten \\"in\\". You are only marveling at the intimidating exterior appearance of Lynch's formidable vehicle. You have not yet actually ridden it. You'll know it when you're \\"in\\", believe me. There's no confusing this. I know exactly how it feels to be on the outside looking in, and how that in no way is this movie's ultimate intent. If anything, the false starts only made my eventual \\"admission\\" all that more meaningful and intense. If you've not experienced it as I have, as a remarkably efficient and elegant conveyor of a profoundly intense experience, then you have missed out.<br /><br />David has exploited all of his previous film, TV, internet, musical, and visual arts in creating an entirely new art, but it's distinct, separate, unlike anything else he's previously created, perhaps anyone else. Don't compare this to Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, Twin Peaks, or even to his webcast videos. This is entirely its own beast. David's web series Rabbits are a deconstruction of the Western narrative form that, through Film Noir, emerged as a compelling means to convey our innate sense of deep anxiety, confusion and terror of confronting the mysteries of our reality. Rabbits resembles a TV sitcom, a Broadway drama, an off Broadway absurdist experiment, or even a video parody of all of the above, and in Inland Empire the Rabbits take on a \\"sacred\\" role as supernatural icons of our media infused culture. Our persistent suspicion about life is fertile ground for some extremely curious hybrid art. Paranoia is a potent muse.<br /><br />Very often, at key moments, INLAND EMPIRE plays like a horribly trite soap opera. Simultaneously, it feels like a meandering documentary, never quite focusing on any one single topic. And just as often it seems content to hover in an undefined, unlabeled space, not concerned with its name or purpose. None of this is gratuitous, random, arbitrary. It's all supremely relevant, essential. Ultimately, it feels as though there isn't a disposable scene, an inconsequential moment. It's quite lengthy if you're just \\"watching\\" it, but once I managed to get \\"on track\\" it soared past me, around me, through me at a blistering pace. At one point towards the conclusion I somehow was thrown off, I found myself as lost and confused as I had been initially. I stopped and rewound the video to the point of confusion, and sat and considered everything that had just transpired, absorbing as much as possible, and reconnecting with the film's powerful rhythm. Again, I sensed a realignment of my awareness as a fuller sense of the action coalesced into a tangible experience, and I then resumed the video. And now the final scenes were all the more more vivid, lucid, emphatically understandable, and so completely enveloping, like superb 3D in my mind -- Ultra, Mega, Turbo 3D.<br /><br />Many viewers feel, or express a belief, that Laura Dern has turned in an extraordinary performance. I am not so sure. And what's interesting is that I believe that David was not only allowing for an inferior performance from Laura, he counted on it. This may sound absurd to her ardent fans, but I have always sensed that David's fascination with Laura is more her symbolic quality than her specific skill or talent. She is for him a substitute for Hitchcock's recurring Blond Goddess In Peril, but with a skeptical edge. David is more concerned with the image, the notion of the unattainable ice princess, and the lithe, fair skinned, blue eyed Dern functions abstractly as his Janet Leigh, Tippi Hedren, or Grace Kelly. But David has allowed the gaps, the stitched seams, the flaws in her work to show. By exposing the faults and weaknesses of Laura's acting we are granted access to a curious aspect of cinema -- it's inherently deceptive quality. We are being made aware of the synthetic, fabricated artifice that too many people have for so long accepted as the equivalent of reality. As much as it is a willful contrivance, Laura's often confused, scattered, unfocused demeanor may just as much be genuine confusion with her situation. David is depending on Laura's limited awareness of the meaning of his dialog and action, immersing her in an entirely alien world so that he may capture her authentic, true anxiety. It's because of his commitment to authenticity that David in fact deceives Laura. Regardless of his respect and fondness for her, David must exploit her -- exploit her persona, which he himself is largely responsible for -- in the name of artistic integrity. This paradox is as compelling as any other encountered within this daunting video. The scenes of Laura reciting curious dialog at a table before a near mute witness reveal an actress in the process of discovering her character's motivations, excavating deeply stored impulses in the service of illusion. While functioning in the film as a ploy to temporarily confuse the audience as to who -- which manifestation of Laura's character -- we are watching, David video recorded these scenes of her reading these 15 pages as a pretense to scrutinize her process. It's in these intensely focused episodes that Laura is most vulnerable and exposed, and I often winced and cringed at what I perceive are her genuinely awkward, awful attempts at a southern accent. It seems to me that just as he did in Wild at Heart David has allowed Laura to employ a jarringly horrible accent. It's also likely, to me, that Laura is oblivious of just how bad is her attempt. There's every reason to experience her performance as inadequate. David is relying on Laura's inferior talent to fulfill his requirements for an inferior actress, Nikki Grace, in the inferior film within the film, On High In Blue Tomorrows. Rather than ask a really fine actress to \\"play down\\" for the part of Nikki, he hired a genuinely limited actress that he could appropriately exploit. He has risked the success of the entire production on Laura's unwitting participation. Many noted director's have behaved similarly, but not nearly as cynically. David actually staged a very outrageous campaign to get Laura nominated for an Oscar for her work in this film by hiring a cow to walk down Sunset Boulevard, but I believe this was just a blatant and audacious ploy to maintain his deception of Laura. In all truth it's a despicable act, but that's Hollywood, isn't it?<br /><br />There are Doctoral Theses being written about this video, schools of thought emerging that espouse its philosophy, legions of cinephiles that are as traumatized by it as they would be a terrorist attack. All this may be justly deserved, only time will tell. But I can confidently assert that the most revolutionary aspect of Inland Empire is it's entirely unique and unprecedented cinematic method. This astonishingly powerful method is the equivalent of a mind-stilling mantra; the sound of one hand clapping...unattainable ice princess, and the lithe, fair skinned, blue eyed Dern functions abstractly as his Janet Leigh, Tippi Hedren, or Grace Kelly.

B004C3DLJS|5.0|I admit that I am not too keen on jumping on the bandwagon and the emporer's new clothes sindrome when it comes to Hollywood movies, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I rented it for my teen daughter and thought \\"oh well, I'll watch it with her..what have I got to lose?\\" I haven't seen the previous installments of Toy Story. In my opinion it is very well made and is heartwarming and has a positive message. To always be faithfull to friendship because life has it weird turns and dips and the ones you think are trustworthy are really not and friends stick with friends no matter what. It made me feel good and that is the norm to which I adhere to when I judge a movie, even if the \\"critics\\" don't give it high ratings. Highly Recommended.

B001QWBM62|5.0|This has got to be one of the best if not thee best purchase iv'e made in a LONG time. Where do I start?.. I've used it in MTR mode with very good success. You have 4 tracks with endless bouncing and no degradation in sound. You can record various instrumental and vocal tracks, choose and match your favorite takes. Insert or cut n' paste sections from different takes, compress, add FX, mix and keep in WAV format for outboard processesing or transfer to MP3 at variable frequencies...all within the same unit. Then just burn to your computers CD/DVD/RW writer. I did a demo of 10 original songs with minimal equipment. Just this unit, a couple of arranger keyboards..I didn't even need a vocal mic, because I sang right into the built in mics with a decent result. The internal effects while nothing to write home about, are very usable. I recorded, processed and mixed everything on the unit itself. I didn't even use the included Cubase software and I got very good results.<br /><br />Iv'e used it to transfer old media to MP3 format, to make Karaoke tracks, to sample, record live lectures, to record music from Youtube and other sites which don't offer downloadable media...just connect the \\"out\\" from the soundcard on the computer to the XLR or 1/4\\" \\"in\\" of the H4N, set level,and press \\"record\\". It will record to stereo so just transfer,(and if you want to, compress and normalize) to MP3 on the unit itself. It supports up to 64 Gig SD cards so the sky's the limit.<br /><br />I even got a free vacation with this little guy. I went to visit my folks down in Mexico and took the H4N,and my laptop with a CD/RW drive with me. I have a bunch of friends with bands down there. I recorded them live and put the results on a CD. I also transfered my friend's timeless old 78, 45, 12\\" LP's, 8 tracks and cassettes to MP3 format. Everyone was extremely happy with the sound quality and the results. My trip ended being free with the money the gave me and I still had enough for a few extra Coronas. Needless to say, iv'e been back to Mexico two more times this year for free. Try THAT with another piece of equipment.<br /><br />There is a slight learning curve to it and as one previous reviewer mentioned, the manual is cryptic and not all that clear. The origianl manual- translated from Japanese - was not done right. Something was \\"lost in translation\\" as the saying goes. A few phone calls to ZOOM solved the problems. This one engineer at ZOOM was very courteus, knowledgable, took time to explain things in simple english and VIOLA!...light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />Because one button does multiple functions is a problem, but like everything else, once you get in there and mess with it..and a few SOS calls to ZOOM..you start getting the flow of things. The sound which is the bottom line, is top notch as most other reviewers have noted. To put it simple, I played my finished demo tracks to my producer who has been in some of the best studios from Miami to Mexico City and he told me \\"you didn't have to spend all that money on studio time just for these demos..how much did you fork out, man?\\" When I showed him what I had used he couldn't believe it and ordered one for himself on the spot.<br /><br />The unit has so many applications that I feel i'm still scratching the tip of the iceberg here. If you need to record your songs, to sample, to transfer media to MP3 format, to download tunes from sites that don't support downloads, make Karaoke tracks or even to make money - like I did - doing it for other people, you can't go wrong with this little guy.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Sure, Angry Birds is great, but Rovio has never done much with the UI and it has begun to look a little stale. Not so with Angry Birds Rio! Yes, it is technically a licensed game, and we all know that those suck, but Rio is actually a refreshing change of pace for Angry Birds. New UI and level design, and NO PIGS. Thank God.
B003YV64OI|5.0|I easily unlocked the 4th core and overclocked this puppy to 3.5 with no problems.  Idles at 28ºC using a Hyper 212 HSF, if you use only 3 cores it idles at 18ºC(insane!).  Ran prime95 with 4th core and overclocked with no problems.  I got 55ºC as the highest temperature during the stress test.  This is great for budget builds and if your lucky you could get one that also unlocks the L3 cache.....I wasn't that lucky but was happy with what I paid for.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What really struck me about Jimmy Stewart's performance is how he played the film's protagonist George Bailey as he passes through various stages in his life.  I first saw this film when I was in my 20's, so seeing Steward play the character as an impatient young man was illuminating.  At the point in the story where all of George's friends have just finished college, while he is still stuck in Bedford Falls tending to the Bailey family's Savings and Loan, strikes a familiar chord.  At that time in my life I was a weary engineering graduate student, and felt that my life would never really get going.  Stewart plays George Bailey at that age as sullen and indifferent to any possibility that his life might take a turn for the better.  George is played by Stewart in such a way that he struggles betray no interest in Donna Reed's character Mary, the girl who had admired George her entire life--and who George will eventually marry.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I installed the appstore, downloaded Rio, but now Rio won't install. Please help. Hoping it isn't Verizon causing the issue. Anyone know? Using a droid x if that matters.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|As with every...and I do mean EVERY...previous Android version of Angry Birds before this one, upon exiting the app, it always...and, again, I do mean ALWAYS...not only causes a force close of the app, itself, but also causes Android/HTC Sense to force close & restart. I find it funny, in an INCREDIBLY sad way, that ALL versions of Angry Birds run perfectly well on my iPod Touch, yet have NEVER done so on my HTC Hero, even running Android 2.1. Not only does it force close Android/HTC Sense upon exiting, but if you accidentally allow the phone to go into stand-by (ie. the screen goes black/turns off), when you bring up the app (ANY version of Angry Birds), it always returns with some weird/strange \\"triple-image\\"that I can't even describe beyond that (for all who have seen out, you know exactly what I'm speaking of).<br /><br />Is there some sort of spyware/malware in their Android versions? Possibly. Can I prove it? Unfortunately, no, but there are others who, I am certain, could, and if not spyware/malware, then some other VERY serious issues that are, and ALWAYS have been, causing these problems. Once again, in order to return my phone to any sort of normal operation/functionality, it appears I have to, once again, uninstall, yet, another version of Angry Birds from my Android phone, return to only using Angry Birds games on my iPod Touch, and, quite possibly, abandon all future hope of ever being able to run an Angry Birds game on an Android phone, be it this one, or its (hopefully soon-to-be) replacement, without any problems.<br /><br />I might even go so far as to recommend all other Android users do the same, at least until Rovio can produce an Android version of Angry Birds games that are as stable as their iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad counterparts.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorites. Steve Carell does a wonderful job as Gru the evil villan. Other favorite character, Dr Nafario. Bought this for my grandkids and find myself wanting to watch over and over.
1563894696|5.0|This book was amazing if you are any kind of batman comic book fan this is a must have in your collection. The books story is more about Batman in his detective stage and every one in gotham is trying to figure out who the holiday killer is. Im not going to spoil anything but this is that great book that will blow you away all the way through the last page.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|The adapter worked like a charm.  I just plugged it in and it work.  I had to make some changes on the Mac (audio out to HDMI) and TV (had to play with the aspect ratio to get the picture to fit), but other than that it was nice and easy.  They way things are suppose to work.
0545123283|4.0|I dove into Linger right after finishing Shiver and once again couldn't stop reading until I had turned the last page. There is something very enchanting and addicting about these books! In Linger we are introduced to a new character, Cole, and the author also starts telling the story from both his and Isabelle's perspectives in addition to Grace and Sam's. Even though its pretty obvious where the plot is going, there's a lot of emotional struggle in this book which keeps things interesting--Grace dealing with her parents, Sam's new responsibility caring for the new wolves, and Cole caught between fleeing or facing his past.<br /><br />In Linger, the romance develops and continues to be very sweet. I really love Sam's character; he's not the dark, brooding, mysterious, bad-boy that's in practically every YA fantasy novel these days. His character is so refreshing. He's sweet, kind, chivalrous, thoughtful, sincere, sensitive, caring...he's like the sort of guy you would want to date in real life, not your 'fantasy boyfriend.'<br /><br />I was pleased to see that the author let the character's voices break through her own a little more in this book, especially with Cole and Isabelle's points of view. However there's still room for improvement. The author's writing is beautiful, but the thing about first person is it's the character telling the story with THEIR voice, not the author's. Each character will describe things differently, notice different things, etc. Not every character should describe their surroundings with the beautiful, rich language that the author uses (especially Cole and Isabelle. That style is suited more to Sam and maybe Grace in my opinion).<br /><br />One thing that began to bother me was the overuse of the phrase, \\"he/she gave ____ a withering look.\\" I lost count of how many times I came across it. This is the fault of the editor, however, not the author. It's the editor's job to catch overused phrases/words because authors tend not to be able to pick them out themselves.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, but the main reason I have to give it four stars is because of the whole werewolf transformation theory. It's still not making sense, and things are getting even more confusing. Now the characters are beginning to question if heat and cold is what triggers the transformations at all. I think they're just as lost as I am... Hopefully things will become clearer in the next book.<br /><br />I really recommend both Shiver and Linger, and I can't wait to read Forever in July!t themselves.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|An already awesome game, made better. Graphics are excellent in this installment of angry birds. Works great on Droid X on Verizon. Two thumbs up.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love the new game. im glad that they put some different things like in the game. Runs perfectly on Verizon with Droid x. Love there are no ads!
B004I2K4DY|4.0|This is absolutely amazing. I have to say it ranks up with the 10th anniversary concert. And as you Les Mis fans know, that's very high praise.<br /><br />Jean Valjean: Alfie Boe has such a fantastic voice! It was different from all the other Valjeans. It was so pure, yet strong. He knocked Colm Wilkinson out of the water without this one.<br /><br />Javert: Norm Lewis was great. He had such a strong voice and served as the perfect antagonist to Valjean.<br /><br />Fantine: I personally think that Lea Salonga is a better Fantine. Her voice is absolutely gorgeous, but I think better suited for Fantine. She sounded amazing! I have never come across a Fantine I liked until now. Lea Salonga was just...wow<br /><br />Cosette: Cosette, as a character, is as boring as watching paint dry. But Katie Hall is as good as Judy Kuhn, who was also very good.<br /><br />Marius: He honestly wasn't that bad. Yes, he was much weaker than the rest of the cast. However, he did show off a more immature side to Marius and brought a more youthful side to the role. While I don't really think he belonged in the 25 Anniversary Concert, he was good enough.<br /><br />Eponine: Samantha Barks is probably my favorite Eponine. Lea Salonga has a beautiful voice and was a fabulous Eponine. But I think Samantha Barks injects the emotion needed for Eponine. She has rougher voice (as opposed to Lea Salonga's pure, perfect voice), without sounding whiny and still sounding beautiful. Samantha was amazing during \\"On My Own\\" and \\"A Little Fall of Rain.\\"<br /><br />It wasn't a perfect performance, but I still very much enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is amazing. If you're a fan of the original graphic novel, you'll - well, you've probably already seen it and know. If for some reason you haven't seen it, it is highly entertaining and nostalgic for old school Nintendo fans. BUY THIS MOVIE.
B004EQAVHI|1.0|I thought this would be a love story. It was in a way but it was a disgusting story about selling body parts. A mind control over these poor kids that thoughgt they couldn't tell the adults NO.
B003W5C0VM|5.0|I was a Junior in High School when the Stones came to Dallas in 72.  It was the first and only time that I was privileged to see them live.  I didn't remember a great deal about that evening at Dallas Memorial Auditorium, but this DVD filled in the gaps for me in a profound way.    The Rolling Stones put on a fabulous show that night in Dallas, and I am grateful they had enough forethought to record it for posterity.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great graphics, great game! Love the original and this takes it one step higher. Highly recommended, addictive and loads of fun. A must have. Thank you Rovio.

Learn simple tools and techniques that work.    Doubting that these techniques will work? The author tells us what works for him. Guy's name is international known--perhaps, we should take his words seriously.    If you are a human--pay attention to this book that teaches how to interact with other humans.    [...]
B004FRX0MY|1.0|people outside the states can buy books, cd, but no mp3, why? i hope this app will soon be available to non american music lover like me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|if you havent played angry birds you are missing out on a stupidly addicting game. Rio is another great installment to the franchise. Getting it free made it sweeter.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I've always been a bit of a fan of action but not so much horror. Supernatural is the exception. Not only is it full of action and monsters of every kind you can think of, and a whole lot you've never heard of, but the plot line is brilliant and intriguing. The chemistry between this cast is excellent and the acting is such that you're engrossed from the opening to the credits. It's enough to believe that there really are two brothers fighting out there to keep \\"the evil sonuvabitches\\" out. I've even got a  couple friends into the series. I recommend Supernatural to anyone. It's got an amazing storyline and characters, action, thrills, and humor that will never leave you bored.  The only BAD thing about the series is the strong attachment that one grows to the characters and the immediate urge to watch another episode.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Although you rescue birds in this one instead of killing pigs, it's really more of the same. if you're a fan of the originals you will like this one. The graphics seem a bit better than the originals.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote to manage information and references for my work (research articles, to-do projects, files), my business conferences (searchable photo album of key individuals), my hobby (shopping lists, tutorials, references), gift ideas and purchases, and more.    Its fluent cloud/local structure means that if I'm with a client, I can instantly view and email a file to her -- no more making notes to take care of it whenever I get back.    The web clipper is genius (better on Firefox than Chrome, but that may change with new releases) and I use it constantly while researching.    I've gotten so reliant on Evernote, I live in terror of it being discontinued!

B004J4WQ46|2.0|Somebody headlined their review with \\"If you dont like it you dont understand it\\"    I can understand a weak album just fine, thanks. You can overpraise this all you like. But even the band admits it's just not that great. I have no problem with a band evolving and changing its sound, but you still have to pull off the songs. There's some catchy parts in here, sure, but overall let's not fool ourselves into thinking this is a great album.    That said, check out the Vaccines new album. I saw both bands at SXSW and though The Strokes were amazing in concert and Vaccines were ho-hum, when it comes to new albums, Vaccines turned out a much better record.
0439023521|5.0|I don't even like to read, but I loved reading these books.  Can't stop reading, can't put them down, when I do put them down can't wait to go back and resume reading to see what happens next.  When finishing all 3 books can't wait to start over reading them again.  Can't wait for the movies!  LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Game works great, is fun, and it's free (right now), what is there to complain about?<br /><br />There are many reviews here complaining about the following:<br /><br />1. The game crashes on a modified/hacked/overclocked system.<br />If you modify your system you aren't playing with the device that the developer designed their software for, expect problems with homebrew, it's part of the price you pay.<br /><br />2. Amazon requires a credit card on file even though it is free.<br />Nothing is free.  Amazon gets you to download their app, set up an account with a credit card, and gives away this game as an incentive to doing so.  At the same time, Rio gets high reviews because their product is free to the masses.  It is win win.  If you don't like it, don't sign up for the \\"offer.\\"  Pretty simple folks.  If you sort of like it, add a credit card then delete it after downloading; worked for me.<br /><br />Nothing to complain about here, move along, move along.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just finished level 1 and sweating like crazy!!!   I go to the gym as 3+ times a week and just starting doing this video for when i can not get to the gym and already im starting to regret buying that gym membership!   My goal is to lose about 30lbs and with this video its going to happen fast! best buy so far!! A+++
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is a great addition to the series! If you enjoy playing the other versions you will enjoy this one too. Graphics and game-play are seamless as usual.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a funnier version of a great game! According to the video there is movie coming in April.  It's also available at the Apple store! I thank Amazon for bringing it to my attention.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It keeps the same fun of the original gameplay but adds a nice twist with the birds. i dont know why others didnt like it. its part 1 with better graphics
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Game crashes constantly.  The five levels I've managed to okay were good... just want the app to run smoothly. hopefully Amazon or Rovio addresses this soon.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This works great. You can even have lots of junk files on a flash drive and the device will still find the .mp3's and play them without problems. I live in I guess a medium sized town. This gives no issues with reception on multiple FM stations. Great product. I'm buying one for my wife's car now too.

1444710338|5.0|Ten years ago when I used to live in Paris I heard about Dr. Dukan and got the earliest appointment which was for six months later! I got very lucky when someone cancelled her appointmnet and I could see the Dr the next week. Back then he was famous for being nutritionist to super models. Any ways I followed the plan he suggested for me and I lost over 24 pounds in 40 days ( all the weight I wanted to lose) and the weight never came back. It takes your metabolism to another level that even if you cheat you wont gain weight easily! Please give this book a try, at first it is hard to start but when you see the results you wont quit!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This novel was such a page turner. I finished the book in a day and a half, in fact I finished the trilogy in less than a week. It has a little bit of everything; sci-fi, romance, and adventure.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Will not install. Even with SD card unmounted. What a shame. Regular Angry Birds will only update woth sd card unmounted. But this version will not i.stall at all.
B004A8ZWT2|4.0|Most of the reviewers who did not like this movie were expecting some sort of \\"Bourne Identity\\" or \\"Salt\\" style of movie.  Instead, they got something reminiscent of the older 1950's style romances with a hint of cloak and dagger.     I also see a number of people who are wondering why the Golden Globes nominated this for three awards, they were all nominated under \\"Comedy or Musical\\" categories.  This was not a Michael Bay explosion-fest, it was a romantic comedy. If you watch this movie understanding that is the category, you will likely enjoy it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Received email. Buy on amazon on my phone all the time. This is crazy ridiculous! It would be nice for someone to answer a question. I love the game but how frustrating.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|You WILL enjoy it even more now! =) Happy downloading! So worth the buck! Thank you so much Rovio &amp; Amazon! You rock! =) =) =)

B004ETVAH0|5.0|Jeff Beck is the greatest electric guitar player, ever.  Period.  I don't care who somebody names - nobody has the depth, originality and ability to perform brilliantly in a plethora of styles like Jeff.  He has conquered metal, blues, jazz, rockabilly, rock and roll, industrial/techno and even classical arrangements and each time set the bar high enough that no other person can compete.  Why the establishment press like dinosaurs Rolling Stone and FM classic lame radio kiss Clapton's ass is a mystery to me.  Clapton has never been anything but a blues retread hack and could never play in the various styles Jeff Beck has.  For that matter, neither can anybody else.<br />  \\"Jeff Beck Rock And Roll Party\\" is a fantastic live set that pays tribute to the late great Les Paul, whom Beck greatly admired and was a personal friend.  Les Paul had quite a few pop hits in his heyday, including \\"How High The Moon\\" with his then-wife Mary Ford.  That tune featured overdubbed backing vocals and guitar licks light years ahead of their time, including slap echo and other innovations Les Paul created.  Beck works with the Imelda May Band and she is a shining vocalist who really captures the feel and essence of the time period (mid-50's).  Her sultry voice steams, and she proves herself a great foil for the wild lead work from Jeff, who faithfully recreates the licks and tones of his hero.<br />  A few tunes that first appeared on \\"Crazy Legs\\" also show up here, including \\"Double Talking Baby\\", the Gene Vincent hit.  Brian Setzer appears on Eddie Cochran's \\"Twenty Flight Rock\\", while Beck solos on \\"Apache\\" and \\"Sleep Walk\\".<br />  This is a must have for all lovers of rock and roll and Jeff Beck.  No modern guitarist has done so much to make the public aware of his favorite music growing up, and his ability to recreate greats like Cliff Gallup and Les Paul are absolutely astonishing.  For this reviewer, rock is great, but if you can't rock and roll too, you're missing what makes all rock music possible.  Listen, enjoy, and be humbled.ssing what makes all rock music possible.    Listen, enjoy, and be humbled.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|because I'm addicted to this game.  Since I'm not much of a game player, I figured that I'd download just one to give it a try.  Unfortunately, after the easy download on my LG android, I was stuck in the same spot playing Angry Birds Rio for over an hour.  Had I not started with a reduced droid battery, I likely would have continued playing for at least another hour.  I have yet to read the rules, but played instinctively and found myself progressing pretty quickly up to a point which was even more enticing.  I usually do not care for audio distractions, but I found the audio with this game to be endearing and not at all annoying.  I'm really glad Amazon offered this app because it's opened a new area of Android use for me!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Game play and graphics are perfect on my Galaxy Tab, and I love the premise of the new storyline. This game was a perfect offering for the Appstore's (oops, hope Apple doesn't sue me too) debut.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Not so clever to email global users,  allow them to sign up on the promise of free angry birds :-)  ,  insist on credit card confirmation even tho it's free, then say actually you can't have it. Poor show.
B004E547D8|5.0|My husband and I laughed so hard during this movie that our sides hurt. It was great - the actors were funny and adorable but really good. Our son & his family came to visit and we played it for him and he, his wife and their sons really loved it. It has to be one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time.
B004IE0G58|5.0|The title of the CD and Blu-ray says it all.  SOme of these songs haven't been heard of in many years.  They dropped Basket Case, Longview and some others.  Not in the Live show but on the Disc.  Paper Lanterns and 2000 Light years away back to back was awesome for sure. I think this Live disc is even better than bullet in a bible, just my opinion.  I have been a GD fan since about 1992 and the Kerplunk days so if you are as well, this will make you very happy.  Glad I purchased this.  If you are a fan, pick it up.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a great version if angry birds.  brings new cards to the table.  Not as hard as others but still really fun.  Runs perfect Motorola Atrix AT&T
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Higher quality textures. More animations within the creatures. Better sound production overall, sound effects flow better &amp; music is more dynamic. More goals within levels besides getting 3 stars. No Ads. Smoother gameplay with no stuttering or freezing. Yellow and blue birds, etc... are more responsive to taps. Total upgrade to an already great game.
B004SBX112|2.0|And it's not just the seasonal graphics that make it not like the original.    The original actually obeyed the laws of physics to some degree.  This one does not.  Bricks can stay in the air with absolutly no supporting structure.  They are magical I guess.  Because of this, using any knowledge of reality will not help you in this version.  It is totally random.    And sorry, but you can get this for free using the Market installed on your very own phone.
0061992860|5.0|Excellent guidebook.  Have the big one for my Bug Out Kit and the small version for my car.  Great Techniques, simple explanations, and decent picture/captions to get you through.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I decided to give this 5 stars because I'm assuming it will be awesome like the others however it's not on the Android Market yet and also I tried downloading this from the Amazon App store and it says its already been downloaded so I check the all apps tab where it says it should be and it's not there. Help?
B004SBS8LA|1.0|after spending 10 mins on how to obtain amazon appstore. I am greeted by this message. this app is not available in your region.....   hi rovio please bring this game to the marketplace.thank you
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Fun game that works and looks great on my Xoom!  Rescuing the exotic birds from their cages is almost more addicting in than the original!
B0002CH8C4|5.0|You won't be sorry!<br />The three previous reviews were on target, minus one more comment that needs to be said.<br />The extra comment refers to having a look in the Audio setup, finding DTS sound, and implementing it.<br />Oh, magnifico!<br />It was perfectly mixed and made the pleasure factor x 2.<br /><br />The singing was wonderful; all three major characters were outstanding.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Blu Ray of La Traviata, with Gheorghiu. The DTS was so bad, I had to switch to PCM sound.<br />Maybe that's why it was so cheap?<br /><br />This Tosca was glorious. I remember her leaping off a wall at the end. This ending was a little different.<br />You wont be sorry if you buy this one.<br /><br />Fred Auerbach
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game. but I would like to know why it is us only. cmon is it coming out in other countries? and when will it be coming out in the UK?
B003IGMJ4I|5.0|i bought this cd from else where only because polar nights was removed from the us remaster let's face it if you've heard this cd before you want all the songs in original order thats why i love this remaster the cover maybe different but on the inside you get all the original art work plus more concert photos buy it if you love the original in its entirety!

B0002TKFR2|3.0|Who am I writing this for? I don't care a hoot for sound-in-itself, because I'm interested in the music first, then the performance. So if you're sound buff, read the other reviews.  Same deal with Heifetz worship. he was a fiddler, not a composer. It is sheer nonsense to claim that he was \\"the greatest\\", or this recording \\"the best ever\\". These things cannot be quantified. To say such a thing is not helpful to a reader either; and we are supposed to be helpful when writing reviews.  There has always been a \\"problem\\" with Heifetz. Music lovers unacquainted with it, should be made aware that technical difficulties didn't exist for him. The outcome was that he tended to play faster than other violinists, and accordingly his recordings of the standard masterpieces (like Beethoven and Mendelssohn) may come to sound aloof, uninvolved. It is true that Heifetz had a tendency not to linger over gentle melodic lines. These are facts, not opinions. Everyone is in a position to discern them. The question is simply whether the listener feels comfortable with it or not. This is where these few lines wish to help.  Both these concertos exhibit Heifetz's urge to \\"get on with it\\". The sheer fluidity of Heifetz playing is indeed a marvel. But now I have to give my own opinion, based on something like 40 to 50 auditions of the recording and its principal rivals. I find that, in Beethoven's head movement, he does not bother to articulate the expressive episodes; and that he is strongly inclined to rush over scales running up and down, as if they were totally uninteresting - whereas Perlman for one finds plenty of honey to pour over those phrases. In certain moods you might find Heifetz's nonchalance, his refusal to dig into the music and find the greatness not his own in there, extremely irritating. The other two movements are much better in this respect - the last movement because the little tune actually sounds better on the fast side.  What I've said here about Beethoven applies inequal measure to Mendelssohn. This is not as well recorded as the other work: it is more dull, the orchestra sounds thicker and more muffled; and once or twice Heifetz's violin gives off a shriek. There is however, one issue that may tilt the balance in his favour for those who are interested in historical curiosities. For this recording Heifetz used the same violin (Khevenmuller Stradivari) on which Ferdinand David played the world premiere of the work.  I personally find these recordings indispensable as historical documents of one of the great musicians of the 20th century. But I have plenty of other recordings in my collection when I just to immerse myself in the music. If you have yet to buy your first recording of either work, then Heifetz is unlikely to be a first choice recommendation. You have know this music very well to appreiate what he is doing. But if you have other recordings and wonder what greets you here, I hope you'll get the gist of it from this short account.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Jack white impressed me. Also, I liked U2 but knew nothing about the Edge. Ofcourse Jimmy Page, what can I say! Love this and bought it. I've been passing it around to my friends and they love it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I think this version is more entertaining than the original. The graphics are even better. And the music is fun. Great game, I really like it!
0553801503|2.0|**spoilers **   What bothered me the most about the 4th entry in this series wasnt the absence of most of my favourite POV characters. I could live with that. What really grieves me is to watch a fine writer being doomed by some very serious writing syndromes. I'll try to explain some of them bellow.  *The Titus Andronicus syndrome. Titus Andronicus is Shakespeare's worst play. It is a bad play because Shakespeare tries to \\"shock and awe\\" us with an arbitrary string of horrible things happening. However, what it really does is to bore us. Because it becomes predictable: whenever you come across a likeable character, you know something bad -- or something awful -- will happen to him or her. This syndrome of course was already present in the other books in this series, but in FFC Martin really succumbs. Were you eager to know what happened to the Hound? Well, he's dead. Did you come to like Brienne even if her POVs are infinitely dull? Well, she gets half of her face chewed off and then she is hanged. Was Davos Seaworth one of the nicest guys in Westeros? Well, now you learn he is (problably) dead and had his hands and feet hacked off. And we all know Tyrion lost his nose, Jaime lost his sword hand and Catelyn became a zombie. I'm not saying that bad things should'nt happen to characters I like; I'm just saying that, after a while, it ceases to be \\"bold\\" and \\"realistic\\" and it becomes just another predictable cliche.   * The Robert Jordan syndrome. Robert Jordan could write hundreds of pages without advancing the plot even a little bit; he seemed to think that anything happening to this or that character was worth telling. So he tells us how someone went to some inn, how he or she wandered about the common room, then went outside to breath some fresh air, then got to the common room once again, then sipped some beer, then went outside, then came back to the inn, then went to his or her room and slept, then woke up and... well, you got it. His books got too long and henever finished his series.   *The James Clavell syndrome. Except for Shogun, almost all of James Clavell's books are packed with legions of useless, superficial  and underdeveloped characters, that simply get in and out of the main action without leaving any remarkable mark upon our memories. That's what happens with most character in the ironborn and dorne subplots. I actually liked the action in the ironborn subplot; I just cant understand why it had to be told through three different POVs. The thing gets even worst with the dornish; for me the Hootah and the Oakheart chapters are a mistery. They are simply useless. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of those new POVs characters, although I found the plot itself interesting at times.     All that said, I must add that I did enjoy Jaime's chapters.     Hopefully, all those flaws will be mended in the next volume. I still trust Martin's extraordinary talent as a storyteller. He wont disapoint us in the end, I'm sure.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I was looking to buy this Blu-Ray & DVD Combo pack as a gift to my kids and finally I found it here for a very reasonable price. This is a very good movie and we enjoyed it. A very nice way to end the Toy Story trilogy. Thank you Pixar & Disney.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|To be quite honest, the only thing similar to Battle Royale is the fact adolescents are fighting to the death in a yearly event required by the government. There's not nearly as much brutality as there is in Battle Royale, but only time will tell if the movie will take it up a notch. I kept reading this book hoping for something more exciting to happen and when it did, it just wasn't enough. If you're looking for survival fiction, please look elsewhere. This is more about playing up the romance than fighting in an all out brothel. I will finish the series though, because there's something that draws me in, although I'm not quite sure what it is.        ***SPOILER ALERT***    The fake romance was really unnecessary. It didn't add anything to the story, for me. Trying to get sponsors to send you things by pretending to be in love with the boy who loves you is just dumb. The survival techniques Katniss had were impressive and I think that may be what makes me like her. I liked Katniss' interaction with Rue and I was sad when Rue died. It would have been nice to see them fight together. The end of the games was enjoyable, because Cato was attacked by humanlike dogs who resemble the tributes who had already died or been killed. I liked when Katniss and Peeta decided to eat the poisonous berries to get back at the Gamemakers for changing the rules back to only having one winner when they changed it to two, if they were from the same district. I didn't like that they still kept the fake romance going after the games ended. I felt bad for Peeta at the end, because he was really in love and she never was.
B000002H97|5.0|After reading some of the 1 star reviews i felt compelled to defend this great rock cd.  For the record this is not where they started their downfall.  This brought them up to their highest.  It is so high that after they couldn't keep up with it.  every album after just got worse and worse and st anger.  listen to every album after this one and tell me again what you think of this one.
B0042816YK|1.0|Oh please - what were they thinking?? Another little rich girl gets sympathy for not having everything she wants in life, and applauded for focusing solely on herself. Jumping from one man to another to fill her own emptiness - oh poor baby. If she could travel where she wanted, and eat what she wanted, and enjoy her money, that's fine; but to actually write a book and have a film about your boring self is another thing.       No worries about job, money, responsibilities or obligations to others - no wonder she experienced ennui. Now she's even wealthier for publishing the nauseating drivel about her useless life, and we're expected to think of her as courageous and deep. No way.     Oh, she leaves the men, but she's the one who's \\"heartbroken\\"??? I'm not saying she should have stayed with them if she didn't want to, but the entire story is so ridiculous.
B004132HZS|5.0|Item arrived quickly and in good shape for the amount we paid for it:). So far, all episodes play well. (Haven't had a chance to watch all of them yet:). Communication from the seller was great! Thank you for such an easy transaction!

B001TK3XPE|4.0|I read this book when it first came out. David Lodge is one of my favorite authors. It is \\"cozy british literature' (with my sincerest apologies to Mr Lodge.)  Not brilliant, like some of his earlier novels, but very entertaining.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I obtained this CD before it's release date, which was great because I'd been   counting the months, weeks and days to it's release. I immediately put the CD   into my player and began listening. After the first two listenings, I came to   the realization that \\"Dust Bowl\\" is Joe Bonamassa's best offering to date. That   thought in and of itself scared me (I remember what happened to Peter Frampton's   career after his mega-hit \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\"). It's hard for me to say that   \\"Dust Bowl\\" is Joe's best, because his past albums are all great in their own   right, but I do believe that he out does himself on this CD. Even Joe believe's   this CD to be his best. In the liner notes (yes, I read the liner notes), Joe   writes, speaking of producer and friend, Kevin Shirley, \\"He knew I was tired and   needed a respite, but he was able to get out of me the best album to   date.\\"    The CD opens with \\"Slow Train\\", written by Joe and long time   producer Kevin Shirley. The song beautifully strikes the tone for the whole CD.   The opening licks remind me of Sonny Landreth's \\"Grant Street\\" CD, especially   the song \\"Broken Hearted Road\\".     The next track, \\"Dust Bowl\\", was released as   a single several weeks ago. This song alone, in my humble opinion, gives a   person all the justification that they need to purchase the CD.     Another jewel on the CD is \\"The Meaning Of The Blues\\". This song is a Jazz standard   written by Bobby Troup and made a hit by wife Julie London. Joe breaths new life   into it by adding the blues-rock grittiness that he is becoming famous for.     The eighth and ninth tracks are also real stand-outs among a CD full of   them. \\"Heartbreaker\\", the eighth cut features the voice of rock icon, Glenn   Hughes (Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Black Country Communion).     Also making   guest appearances is prolific songwriter/singer John Hiatt (Hiatt's songs have   been covered by everyone from Three Dog Night to Eric Clapton, BB King, Buddy   Guy, Keith Urban and even Iggy Pop), Blues singer Beth Hart and Country royalty,   Vince Gill.    This CD is a must for every Joe Bonamassa fan, and I would   recommend it to all who enjoy great Blues-Rock.
1591843065|5.0|Coaches and consultants use multiple techniques for brainstorming and solving problems, including the \\"Five Whys\\" technique, the \\"Fishbone\\" diagram, and mindmapping. Adding to those ideas, Dan Roam published his own problem-solving system in a book called The Back of the Napkin.<br /><br />The main idea of the book is the usefulness of drawing simple pictures when analyzing the root cause of a problem, brainstorming solutions, and presenting proposed solutions to senior management. Roam's system is straightforward, creative, and replicable over time. He helps focus problem-solvers on the classic questions associated with any problem: who/what, where, when, why, how, and how many.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be incorporating some of the ideas into my own toolkit. Whether you work with flip charts, Post-it notes, a whiteboard with different colored dry markers, or Roam's system of visually portraying the relevant variables, stimulating creativity can be invaluable when analyzing and solving problems.

B004FPE4DK|5.0|I heard reference to this performer during South By Southwest in Austin. I ordered the CD and must say he is one of the more refreshing performers I have enjoyed in several years. His voice is plaintive and protesting and his music and lyrics distinctive and deep to the heart of human experience. I enjoyed each and every selection although I must add that some say his lyrics are too depressive and mono-thematic. As I said, I thought the music and lyrics spoke eloquently to emotions resident in most of us. But I can understand the reaction of some. Worth the investment of money and time to listen to a musical catharsis.

0553386816|5.0|First let me say that I have read or listened to all of John Grisham's legal thrillers!  I love them all and was not sure about reading something from him that wasn't a legal thriller.  Let me just say I was VERY pleasantly surprised.  All the short stories left you hanging on the edge of your seat.  They ended unexpectedly and were full of suspense and drama.  My only complaint would be that there aren't more of them!  They were brilliant!
0515141429|1.0|In addition to the inanities mentioned by others, let me add a few more:  1. Apparently Child has confused Atlanta with Fairbanks, at least as far as climate goes. Reacher parks a car in a lot at the Atlanta airport with 3 dead bodies in the trunk. As he does so, he muses that the car will be inconspicuous probably for as much as a month. Small problem: It's still warm to hot in Georgia in September, when the car is left. Within a very short time anyone with a sense of smell coming within a hundred yards downwind of the car will know that something is very wrong indeed.  2. Reacher is a dead shot, hitting heads at a hundred feet or more. O.K., he's trained. But then why does he miss killing Picard, one of his most important shots? Yes, Picard is huge. But, short of being the proverbial 800-lb. gorilla, I don't care how large you are. If you're hit anywhere in the chest cavity with a soft-nosed .44 magnum slug, you aren't going to be walking around. And, for that matter, how did Picard get back to Margrave so quickly? He must have called Kliner and had someone pick him up. But then why is he already not part of the crew waiting in the warehouse, along with Teale and Kliner? That is, why does he show up at the last moment?  3. Joe Reacher is said to be smart and (especially) thorough. Then he surely would have done a background check on Kliner, and found that he was a suspect in 8 other murders. (He would have known about Kliner from one of the old professors.) So why did he go tooling up to the warehouse in broad daylight, conveniently giving Kliner the chance to shoot him?  4. The biggest gaff of all: Joe is said to be a Treasury agent. But the U.S. government agency that investigates counterfeiting of U.S. currency is the Secret Service, not the Treasury Department.  These are all the sorts of things that would have been caught by an editor - when publishers had editors.
0375507256|5.0|Probably the most entertaining book that I have read in the past decade.  Mitchell is an extremely clever author.  I won't spoil it, but the reader is in for a huge surprise early on.  After that, you might as well accept that this book will be your whole life until you finish it.
159420229X|4.0|Joshua Foer spent a year of his life, as part of a research assignment, working on his memory skills. By visualizing \\"memory palaces\\" in his mind, he was able to reconstruct some amazing things like the order of a deck of cards, or the names of random people matched to their faces, or strings of digits in a row. The techniques he used allowed him to form mental images that border on the obscene and bizarre, and make total complete sense. Thus is the premise of his fascinating new book (with one slight flaw), \\"Moonwalking with Einstein\\".<br /><br />After watching the U.S. Memory Championships one year, Foer sets off to train himself to participate in the following year contest. He gets support from fellow \\"rememberers\\", both national and international, to improve his chances, and trains daily for the event. Through this journey, Foer explains many of the theories behind how to remember, which in and of themselves is a fascinating read. Foer reaches back into history to detail the progress of memory, when once it was a time-honored tradition and a necessity before the printed word, but now is being ruthlessly attacked by Post-it Notes, cell phones, and other devices that are becoming our digital memory itself.<br /><br />As Foer trains, he describes the things he's visualizing, and it is both raucously comical and disturbing, and dare I say, memorable? The trick he uses to remember a deck of cards (which in turn inspired the title of this tome) intrigues those of us interested in such devices. But as Foer says, all it is is a device, and one that anyone of average intelligence can learn. In fact, people with incredible memories aren't necessarily the brightest, but possibly the most creative.<br /><br />I began to wonder how this skills applies to student learning (me being a teacher). Foer addresses that in a chapter in which an innovative high school teacher in the Bronx uses memory techniques to help his students remember. Also introduced to me is Tony Buzan and [[ASIN:0452273226 The Mind Map Book: How to Use Radiant Thinking to Maximize Your Brain's Untapped Potential]], of which I knew little but have since been launched on a journey to learn more. The Bronx teacher uses it as a tool to note take, study for tests, and as a final project. intriguing!<br /><br />One slight pause that I had with the book occured toward the middle of the end, when Foer goes on the \\"attack\\" (for that's how it read to me) of Daniel Tammet, world known as a \\"savant\\" for remembering things at amazing length. Foer goes to great length to question Tammet's progress, coming to the conclusion that he isn't all that he's claimed to be; that he is simply using memory techniques that he knows. Whether that's true or not isn't the point. It does interrupt the narrative flow of the story, and puts an odd and uncomfortable light on the story. Foer debated whether or not to include it; he should have listened to that little voice inside his memory palace, and left it there untouched and unwritten.<br /><br />However, the book soars in so many other aspects that I have to recommend it. As Foer enters the contest, the climax of the story is compelling. You are rooting for this novice competitor. In the end, a thought began to occur to me, though. Memorizing shuffled decks of cards? Memorizing strings of numbers? What is the point? When  was the last time I had to memorize things of little consequence? Foer comes to a similar conclusion in his epilogue, in which he reflects about the year, and how, despite all of his training, he still loses his keys from time to time.<br /><br />Still, the art of memory is fascinating, and one definitely worth exploring, and you can't begin your exploring in an more entertaining way that starting to Moonwalk with Einstein ... just stay away from Bill Clinton and his basketball!d Map Book: How to Use Radiant Thinking to Maximize Your Brain's Untapped Potential]], of which I knew little but have since been launched on a journey to learn more.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Upgraded a stock cooler for an AMD Phenom II 965, couldn't hear myself think with the stock cooler.  It was a little difficult to install this cooler, however it is quite, cools better than the stock cooler, and it was priced very competitively.      Keep in mind what everyone else said about the size though, if the back of your case fits a 120mm fan you will be fine, otherwise you might want to go with a smaller cooler.    Overall, I am very satisfied, and after three months I haven't had a problem.

0061438294|5.0|Joe Navarro does an amazing job of laying out the nonverbals of every part of the human body in this book \\"What Every Body is Saying\\".<br />From comfort/discomfort displays, to confidence/insecurity displays, he makes it clear and concise, providing over 80 figures (pictures) depicting many of the specific nonverbal gestures in question, and he provides more than 50 examples of nonverbal expressions from his experience in his 25-year career as a nonverbal communication expert in the FBI.<br /><br />There's also a special chapter toward the end devoted entirely to the subject of deception. With popular TV shows like \\"Lie to Me\\" Joe's warning is all the more important: Niether laypersons nor professionals are very good at detecting deception. It's important not to label someone a liar simply because they show one or two signs of stress/discomfort. There are no nonverbal cues that are in and of themselves indicative of deception.<br />I really appreciated that chapter and his careful warning about coming to hasty conclusions about deception.<br /><br />The skills taught in this book are easy to understand and very practical. It just takes practice is all. I've already noticed significant behaviors in my family, coworkers, and even my Pastor. Those behaviors act as a window into other peoples' thoughts and feelings and allow me to better understand how they feel so that I can respond appropriately. I hope that someday Navarro will release an expanded version of this book.<br /><br />Definitely five stars. I highly recommend it.
B001AQO3XS|3.0|This movie is by far my favorite of all time. I have been a fan since it was released. However this blu ray version is ok at best. There seems to be two different masters being used to produce this version as it is grainy in places and smooth in others. I have the DVD version of this movie also and don't have that issue. I was hoping to find more added features to it, but there weren't many. I give this a 3 star only because of the blu ray quality and not the movie itself.

B004LSJCJM|5.0|I have purchased every Joe Bonamassa album and each album gets better and better. He is a great guitarist. His album ' Dust Bowl' is just another in a great set of albums. I can say that I have finally found an artist that gives you an entire album of great songs on each and every album. Definitely worth buying all his albums and his newest album. you will not be disappointed.
B003JSU2NU|5.0|This is an excellent product. It arrived much sooner than I thought it would and of course it was in excellent condition because I bought it brand new.
B004L49K20|5.0|I never in a million years imagined that Duran Duran would ever again release a cd that would really sit up there in rank with their first three released so some months later, I'm still in a bit of shock. Though an avid fan since the early days, I can't say I really liked everything they did since Seven And The Ragged Tiger. A lot of it was hit or not so hit...but not often miss. With each release, there was something on there that kept me a fan and continuing to buy their releases.    So here we are, 2011. I was a bit annoyed at the whole itunes marketing ploy but again.... it's 2011 and this is the new way. I'm old school and like the actual cd in hand....with ALL of the released songs thank you. So, today is a nice treat to finally have the entire collection. The wait since December 2010 is nothing in comparison to the wait that has been since Seven and The Ragged Tiger. This here is a true 100% cohesive cd from beginning to end. Each song blends together nicely and the melodies and funk groove beats so reminiscent of their early days. It is INFECTIOUS! Gosh, I can't believe someone already rated the cd in here a ONE star. Are you deaf?? Hopefully if that sad chap gives it a fair shot, it will all sink in.     Having said that, I have to admit that I'm not so much into the first song. It's a bit awkward but is reminiscent of All She Wants Is...which I wasn't so fond of either so it makes sense. But Being Followed, Girl Panic, Leave A Light On, The Man Who Stole A Leopard, and Before The Rain are without a doubt some of the absolute most incredible songs they have written since 1985.     I am not a 'Duranie' per say, but feel compelled to write a review on this because three months after the release on iTunes, I'm still feeling as passionate about this release as I did then. And with the extra tracks now, I'm even floating on a higher cloud with this. I read many reviews on cd's before buying them and it's hard to pick out who is being truthful and who is just stamping a release 5 stars because they are 'like totally devoted' to a group. 'All You Need Is Now' is completely deserving of 5 stars as was their first three releases in 1981, 1982, and 1983. You'd be hard pressed to find any artist that can claim that.    So, if by reading reviews you're on the fence as to whether or not to shell out the money for this based on biased opinions regarding Notorious, Big Thing,Medazzaland, Pop Trash (which I also loved and rank a solid 4 star), take the leap and buy this one, you won't be disappointed. Elements of 'The Chauffeur', 'Friends of Mine', 'The Reflex' 'Last Chance on the Stairway', 'Save A Prayer' are all present but in a fresh new and exciting entrance to this decade. Enjoy!
B000008GHW|5.0|I bought this album (vinyl)when I was in high school (class of '72) and it has been my favorite rock album of them all(I'm talking ALL of classic rock), this is the original line-up of songs. I had to buy a european import to get this on CD 22yrs ago.Glad to see it out for all to enjoy. By the way, all of these songs + plenty more from 'Crash Landing and War heroes'(I have both of those on vinyl also)are on the fabulous album 'First Rays Of The New Rising Sun',get it and take the journey of the best of rock history!

The 20 minutes fly by (I hardly notice the background music) and Jillian does a decent job in describing how the moves work and what they do for your body. Truly a great addition to any workout DVD collection

0670022411|1.0|Why did I read most of this book? I don't know. It's pretty terrible. I don't particularly like any of the characters. There's a lot of descriptive sections about food and fine wines. Pretty irritating. I just discovered that this is only the first book in a... what... series? I don't know.    I couldn't finish it. And this is saying something, as I'll read a lot of crap (as well as a lot of good stuff). For fun vampire romance, go with the Sookie Stackhouse books.
B004J4WQ46|1.0|Metabolism immediately brings to mind the futuristic sounds of First Impressions of Earth, with tracks like Vision of Division. You know.. that progression to a more glossy anthemic sound as opposed to the intimate washed out melodies of 'Is this it'. With Muse-esque guitaring and 8-bit technodrome basslines that are reminiscent of old Nintendo games.     It really makes it difficult to get a handle on what this album is. As a record, it is constantly morphing from old school Strokes, 80s synth ('two kinds of happiness' and 'Games') to first Impressions.    Gratisfaction sounds like something out of a 'Spoon' album with a Queen like transition between verses.Im not sure what to make of it. Its a bouncy track but the core melodies are so generic and boring. Maybe its because the melodies in general dont have the lyrical punch that the first two albums had. Do you remember Casablanca's dynamic sarcasm and sincerity... well now he either moans in the vain of the horrible \\"ask me anything\\", muffles meaningless harmonies or incites cheesy sing along moments instead.    You're So Right could be mistaken for a radiohead song at first. \\"tell me what happen-- Tell me what happen\\" but then somewhere along the track it transcends into some sort of 'Pet Shop Boys' showdown.     Under Cover of Darkness is old school Strokes, reminds me of 'Someday' with its melancholy. Its fresh and still true to the sound of the Strokes. \\"Life is Simple in the Moonlight\\" further helps instill the core beauty of the Strokes, and its almost sad to see this final track really nail what I had hoped to hear the entire time. That being angular layers of catchy melodies that dont hide behind a wall of pretentious sounds, which brings me to my final thought. \\"Angles\\" feels like every member in the band needs to be heard. Its not a team game here. This is a bunch of hotshot individuals, all with their side-project credentials wanting to make their sound, bouncy basslines, guitar solos and drum beats allplaying to their own set of tunes... The backbone is missing. Strokes at work 'Machu Picchu' is a good example. And that maybe fine for larger than life bands like Kiss or Van Halen that strive on big sounds and lots of attitude but the core mechanics of this group relied on a more effortless, cool bunch of nobodies... you know like 'the outsiders'. Blood brothers forever right?    And then we come to my objection before the accusation. That somehow because the band sounds different, we owe them praise. But that doesnt automatically make this a great album. Is it fresh?  I dont even think that. The strokes are branching out trying to be everything. At least First Impressions had a deliberate thematic approach, this new album is a little bit of this and and a little bit of that. It has not evolved into a cohesive project, and they know this. Thats why its called 'Angles' its a cop out as if to say they purposely meant it to be this way. A mish mash of all sorts.   They should have decided on an angle to begin with.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love angry birds and rio is no different, the graphics are crisp, gameplay is smooth and everything works as it should. My main issue is that once you find the hidden items (no longer golden eggs) there is nothing to do with them. The items are a little too easy to find and I miss the fact that eggs used to be hidden in all aspects of the game, not just in the levels. I always looked forward to getting the star for my golden eggs and I wish something similar had been included. The menu isn't my favorite  either but I can get past that. It's a great app, way above the rest I just miss sime of the things that makes the game what it is.

031603438X|3.0|I worried about Richards' book being self-serving and a voyage through bad boy land.  But I am a sucker for rock 'n' roll biographies and have read lots of them.  This one started out well: an interesting look at the beginnings of the Stones and the dumb things they all did as kids, trying to find their musical footing.  But then the book became a seemingly endless recounting of drugs, arrests, sexual forays, how to avoid overdosing and escapes from PR disasters and more arrests.  I DID enjoy Richards' explanations about his guitar innovations; I am a guitarist and always wondered how he did some of those riffs.  But the book itself got to be plodding and I finally set it down for good before finishing it.  This could have been a far more interesting look into the joys and trials of superstar life, but was instead a narrower look at the bad boy life Richards' chose off stage.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|JB turns out another one that is a mix of very interesting and widely varied tunes.  While is guitar work is stunning, do not overlook his vocal skill (where did he get those pipes anyway??).    It is still hard to believe he's put out as many recordings to date, a testimonial to a hard-working musician that enjoys his craft.    A musician's musician, and indeed will be a legend if he's not already.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was absolutely disappointed when I defeated the first one and angry birds seasons. The app store for amazon was seamless to download on my gtablet and my husbands gtablet with the same amazon.com account. We only needed one download to install it onto the two different android devices which is awesome.<br />I am loving the game, sometimes it seems to glitch for a second but I am not sure if that is my tablet or the game!<br />Beware the lights and chains!
B000SEHG5U|5.0|There are so many great points and arguments laid out in this book it is truly amazing. For the most part it reads very fast and is hard to put down, one of those 'I'm so tired I can't keep my eyes open but I don't want to stop' kinda books. I read the digital version which was nice because having a dictionary built-in when trying to understand Dawkins is very useful sometimes. If you are an atheist (as I am) I have no doubt you will enjoy it, The God Delusion will reaffirm your beliefs and give great points of consideration. Dawkins has a unique way of verbalizing thoughts which I'm capable of thinking and understanding but couldn't put into words myself. If you are on the fence about religion and read this book with an open mind and some critical thinking you could very easily find yourself joining those of use on the enlightened side of life. And finally if you are hopelessly trapped by 'faith' and 'god' you should still read this book, you can then at least understand why the rest of us think you're crazy.
B000AGTPUU|3.0|It took over a month for the movie to get to us.  Otherwise the DVD was in great shape.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! The ability to switch from version to version gives so much more meaning to the WORD!!! What a wonderfully app! Being able to cross reference and bookmark passages is fantastic!!! The New Living Standard is my new favorite version (this week!!)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a great update to Angry Birds to promote the new movie, Rio! Graphics run smoothly on an Incredible. This instantly became my favorite version of the app
0446581348|5.0|Got this book because I want to go work at a makeup counter and I was just wowed by the amount of information. She pretty much goes in to everything from tools to skincare to different areas of makeup and even discusses career options. I'd say this book is perfect for a beginner because it really goes in to great detail about the basics of beauty! I highly recommend it!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Great product and most outstanding service!  It arrived in record time!  I had a question for the seller, and got a response the very next day! I would buy from them anytime.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Bigger and Better. Rio takes Angry Birds to new heights. Better graphics, smoother performance, nicer effects, improved physics. Rovio continues to fine tune their successful formula!
0525423273|5.0|So I thought that maybe if I had time to let the book settle then I'd have a better clear review to give you guys. But... that didn't really work out lol! I think it works better if I write a review as soon as I'm done with the book.<br /><br />First of all, this book lives up to all it's hype. Anna and the French Kiss is the most adorable read I've ever read! It's as contemporary as contemporary gets but it's so... *sigh*. Seriously, can't be put into words!<br /><br />I'll admit some parts were a little slow moving, and other parts were too fast moving! Or maybe I was just reading it too fast because I wanted to see what would happen next. Who knows! Anna is a very easy to relate to. I could imagine myself as her and in her situation and I could honestly say, I would probably do what she did. I'm horrible when it comes to learning a language and as much as I would LOVE to learn French... I would be horrible at it (which is probably whats taking me so long)! The drama between her and her parents and her friends are realistic. I actually really liked Anna. If she was a real person, I'd want to be her friend. I loved her humor as well and I absolutely enjoyed being inside her head. I also loved how everything that was emphasized was in caps. I don't know why, but I thought that was really cool.<br /><br />St. Claire. What can I say about him that hasn't been said already by many other bloggers? I didn't think I would swoon over him (even though I LOVE his last name) but alas, I did. I was sucked in. Okay, here's the thing. I love St. Claire. I'm sorry Anna, but I do. First of all, he's funny. He's got a sense of humor. He seems like a really nice and honest person. He has an accent! He's easy to talk to and the biggest thing? He likes history. OMG! I'm a huge history nerd. I love all things history. I love how determined he was to help Anna explore Paris. The whole time their friendship was building was adorable. The whole time their friendship was falling apart was adorable. The way St. Claire showed how much he cared, was adorable. I think you're getting the picture here. St. Claire and everything about and around him? Adorable! No, but really, he was a really awesome and realistic character that we all wish was.... real.<br /><br />The journey of Anna and her new life in Paris was exciting. She might have hated it but I thought it was pretty darn exciting. How often does someone get to school in Paris... courtesy of their parents?! Upset or not, enjoy it Anna! A free trip to Paris!! It amazes me how much researching Stephanie put into this book to make it real. I couldn't imagine writing a book about a place I've never been to! But it was amazing. I loved the point zero star thing and I wanted to walk down all the streets Anna walked down. I wanted to visit the shop with the Macaroons, mostly because I love Macaroons and half way through this book I did dive an hour away from home to get Macaroons lol!<br /><br />I don't know what else to say except that... if you haven't read this book by now, you seriously need to. You won't regret it, I promise!aire showed how much he cared, was adorable. I think you're getting the picture here. St. Claire and everything about and around him? Adorable!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game works like a charm.  Plays great on the Xoom and Samsung Epic 4G.  I realy like the start up music :)  I find the game to be more vibrant than the original which makes it look great.  Give me Cut the Rope now Oo
B004SBS8LA|5.0|upgraded graphics, same great gameplay, all for free for the first day. its a great way to kill some time when you have a minute
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I spent 10 minutes downloading Amazon app store and then enabling one click ordering, and trying to download this app, only for it to turn round and say Amazon App Store not available in the UK. Yet I get spammy email messages telling me to download it. Either make it available, or DON'T SEND EMAILS TO UK USERS.
1439177783|1.0|I was waiting for this to be released for a while.  I started reading the book and was semi-interested.    By the end of the 4th chapter she had me off-side.  I know that her illness made her into an unpleasant person, but she really highlights how horrible she was. And by the end didnt seem too much better. I have a problem with people who self-loathe, and this book is just Portia getting the reader to go through her hell. Which was horrible, but she still has a long way to go.    If you are really interested in her, read it. But pass if you were only curious.
0061186473|4.0|Let me first state that I'm an adult Gaiman fan, and I really like his YA work, including this collection. Other reviews have covered what stories are included, so what I'll focus on is the age level so parents can make an informed decision. I bought this book for myself, but to justify its purchase, I figured that my kids (under 10), who are very good readers, could read it, too. I consider myself a pretty liberal parent, but after reading this, I'll tuck it away for when my kids are older. The specs give a reading level of 9-12 years, and I think that's really deceptive. Yes, a reader in that age range can read the words, but the content, the feelings evoked, are much more adult. Even the Humpty Dumpty story requires an understanding of the private \\"dick\\" (as in \\"detective\\") genre to be funny. Other bits that come up in passing are marital infidelity, troll privates, and teen hormones. Nothing is going to corrupt a kid, by any means, and all of these things occur very naturally in their context, but I'm not sure an eight- or nine-year-old kid is really the right audience. Some of the stories would be great to read aloud to younger kids who like spooky stories, but overall, I think the book is really for young ADULTS, not elementary-age kids. If you are a parent or teacher choosing reading material for kids not yet in high school, my advice is to read the book yourself first.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Easy five stars! This is a great app that builds on the previous versions. Now I just need to get some free time to play!
B004SBULWE|1.0|I used to have this app until my phone started having problems. When I brought it in to my carrier, the technician told me that Google has found that this app causes big problems for phones. Google has yet to actually do away with it because so many carriers used to strongly encourage people to get it. Now they are telling everyone about the problems Google has found in studies. Do not use this app! It will eventually destroy your phone and cause it to be very slow with many glitches. It actually would drain my battery completely because it would end up running in the background more than the tasks it was \\"killing.\\" Besides, now that you can upgrade your Android to the new 2.2 you shouldn't need software like this anyway.
B003UESJJC|1.0|Be careful here.  According to Amazon's Info these are 'All Regions' discs.  But none of them will play on my new 'Region B' (Australia) player, and there is no region coding info at all on the packaging that I can find.  It seems Amazon probably just assumed that it must therefore be All Regions.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Its a great item, the only thing it doesn come with the usb cable so you have to get another one for chargin 2 o more controllers at the same time
B001DF68MA|5.0|I brought two of these seats because I wanted my children 2 1/2yrs old and 7mths  to see in front of me and also wanted the opportunity to talk to them while we ride. I was a littler skeptical at first about purchasing this for my 2 1/2 yr old son because I thought he would be to big. But he was not. He loves riding with his father. It was really easy to assemble it took about an hour for both bikes.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|App is free, but you have to enter credit card information to download it. Then I read some people weren't able to install the darn thing even though they went trough all the steps.<br /><br />You know Amazon... I think people would rather pay the dollar and download it trouble-free, rather than mess with their phones files and folders in an attempt to install a \\"free\\" app.<br /><br />Well, my time isn't worth that much trouble. Thanks for trying though.<br /><br />Have this free review on me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a great upgrade from the classic Angry Birds.  Graphics are good and gameplay feels more responsive and faster.  With the classic version, there is a lot of lag which is not noticeable in this version.
B001AYENBM|5.0|This version of \\"I Am Legend\\" is SO much better than the theatrical release! The alternate ending in this version should have been the one we saw at the theatre! This version ends with a note about what it means to BE human, and the humanity associated with it. Loved this version! Highly recommend it if you like virus movies.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|As a free app this is a four star. its more of the same as the original and seasons. if u have to pay for it than I would give it a three star rating.
B0048PU7TC|5.0|Bought it for my wife as an I love you gift and she loves it. Different artist singing along with Nora is awesome.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was actually surprised how clean the graphics were when I tried out this new version, especially on my Droid 1.  Can only imagine what it'd look like if I had a tablet.  The app2SD is also apprieciated.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It downloads, and then when I try to install it, it just says that the app wasn't installed. I'm sure I will love this game when it is installed on my droid x.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I would like one (1) app for everything. Regular amazon, app store, mp3 downloads all from one friendly app, instead of the 3 I have now.
B004EVRM7K|1.0|The price these rip off merchants are asking for Avatar 3D is nothing short of \\"Daylight robbery\\". Under 2yrs ago Avatar blew my mind at the IMAX 3D cinema. It made me buy a 3D TV and search, wait, search, wait, search and wait some more for its 3D DVD release. Since then other 3D movies had been released, but nothing caught my imagination like Avatar. Since Avatar has finally been released, I have sat back and refused to spend that sort of money for a DVD, especially after forking out for a 3D TV. Just as I was about to give in and purchase Avatar at top dollar, I watched another movie called Owls: Flight of the Guardian. I was blown away by the graphics and all the 3D segments. I've since bought the movie at JB HiFi and paid $45AUS for it. Beats Avatar hands down for 3D effects. Its available at most good local Video stores to rent. If you love 3D effects and a children storyline then this is the movie for you. Great Family movie!! Avatars not worth the money anymore.
B000YDI9UG|4.0|These are some great boots!  They've got a good lived-in look and feel.  The laces tend to untie but double-knotting takes care of it.  They fit true to size as well.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is awesome. even better I got it free. Amazon app store is the best for having a free paid available here and there.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is my favorite angry birds version for android so far.  Plus, this ad-free version seems to run much smoother than the versions offered by the android market. This is an excellent start to the new amazon app market.
0756404738|5.0|This review may not seem like a five-star review, because I will be pointing out things that irked me as well as things that didn't. However, to believe that a five-star book must be without faults is silly. Relative to other fantasy novels out there, or really just novels in general, this book is easily five stars. I loved it and was sorry to see it end. This review does not contain spoilers per se, but there might be spoilers of omission...if that makes any sense.    That being said, the man (a certain Mr. Rothfuss) is damnable in his pacing, his tangents, and his unwillingness to move us any closer to answering some questions we've had since about ten seconds into \\"The Name of the Wind\\" (spoilers of omission?). All he does is twirl our heartstrings ever-tighter around his greasy fingers.    Ok, I lied. There're going to be spoilers here. This isn't going to be a review for people who haven't yet read the book. That being said, I'll try not to be too explicit.    To say he takes a leisurely stroll in terms of the pace of this story would be to do a disservice to leisurely strolls everywhere. I've seen glaciers move at a faster speed. I have QUESTIONS. And I want ANSWERS. No, I don't want to spend 400 pages enjoying the many fine aspects of the University. No, I don't care about learning a particular brand of sign language for the better part of 300 pages. No, I'm not interested in beautiful faeries. I want to know about the Chandrian. One of my favorite parts of the book is when Kvothe politely skipped over being set upon by pirates. I thought that was rather kind of him.    That is not to say, however, that these parts of the book weren't fascinating. The previous paragraph was about 50% humorous. The man has a gift, there is no denying. He is telling many stories inside of one story, and he is successful. I am just chomping at the bit. I actually did find the first bit, where he is still at the University, to drag somewhat. It smacked too much of \\"The Name of the Wind.\\" Same problems, same cast of characters. However, the saga where he goes to Vintas I found to be particularly fun to read.    That's why I frowned at the \\"sudden\\" turn in events away from that, involving a particular Faerie. That is the first time I've felt like something has just come up out of nowhere in these books. It was a little too...deus ex machina isn't the right word, but it's the word I'm going to use. \\"Oh, there she is. Let's put this very serious and interesting part of the story on hold for a couple hundred pages.\\" This was the low-point in the book for me, both in timing and execution, which is to say it was still very, very good.     I would've found the trip to Ademre much more engaging if I hadn't been wondering when he was going to get back to Vintas and tie up that particular loose end. It was a fascinating point in the story, and I hope the Adem make a reappearance in the third book, but I found myself skimming parts of it to get back to the meat.    At the end of the novel, I felt like nothing of real merit has been accomplished, and we're just back where we started. I can't quite see where the third book is going to go. Which is a good thing, I suppose. It was a \\"ripping good yarn\\" and I barely put it down over the few days it took me to read it, except to go to work (reading it occasionally AT work) and go to sleep (and sometimes forgoing sleep).     Rothfuss is an intriguing author. He eschews regular fantasy diction, or really anything unnecessarily high-handed. \\"Pretentious\\" is the last word I'd use to describe his writing style. His world-building is exceptional, but heavily downplayed in just the right way. Kvothe takes it for granted that people listening to his story, in his world, know certain things (he actually speaks directly to this point once, \\"everyone knows the Caeldim are moneylenders...etc.). Which helps the story to always feel organic and logical (except for a few missteps, such as Felurian), and he manages to constantly keep me on the edge of my seat. Which is really hard to do, considering the glacial pace and the thousand-page length of this novel. I love reading these books, and they only frustrate me in the way great books can--that is, they leave me wanting more.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I just installed the amazon app to my phone then installed the angry birds rio. All of a sudden it disappeared off my phone. I went to the amazon app and hit the open button and still nothing. I even shut the phone off to see if that worked. It came back after about two hours. Hopefully it stays working.
B004PA50JM|4.0|Just got through listening to Collapse Into Now and I have to say it definitely is the best REM album since New Adventures in Hi Fi.  For those of you rating this CD 3, 2, and even 1 star, what are you thinking??  Even if their last 3 albums before Accelerate sucked big time you shouldn't hold those feelings when you listen to this new CD.  I heard about 3-4 songs that I thought were the best songs REM has done since New Adventures.  Give it another listen...and change those ratings now!!! :)
B004LP601S|5.0|if you like panic! you should buy this album.   it includes the artwork of the second album with the sound of the first.  when im listening to this album, it brings back nostalgia of the original album.    BUY THIS ALBUM!!
B002361MLA|5.0|From personal experience, I had been felling anxious and depressed for a long time. I`ve been an avid reader of self help books for a long time and none helped. This is really  a lifechanging book, the author is able to explain deep concepts in a way that anyone can understand.<br /><br />Don`t waste another second of your life in suffering, don`t read another book about the Law of attraction (like I did for a long time). Get this book now.
B004L49K20|5.0|Mark Ronson said \\"I am going to make the record that Duran Duran fans want to hear\\", I think he accomplished what he set out to do.<br /><br />You will be humming these songs long after your mp3 players batteries run out of juice.<br /><br />It is easily their best album since Rio. Simon's voice is the best I have ever heard it. A must have for Duranies and anyone else who appreciates upbeat catchy pop music.

B004SBS8LA|3.0|I love the original angry birds but Angry Birds Rio keeps crashing on my phone. I have the Motorola Droid 1 please fix the problem.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Best graphics of any Angry Birds game yet. Amazon app store rocks. Had to side load for my AT&amp;T Galaxy Captivate. No problem to do that though.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another hit from Rovio.  * Make sure you allow application from outside sources. * US users ONLY. * Don't blame Amazon or Google, it's AT&amp;T.
067101756X|2.0|I'm only on page 87 and he says on a trip to London, Frank Wiesner committed suicide by hanging himself. If you google Frank Wiesner it says he committed suicide by placing his sons shotgun to his right temple on his Maryland farm.<br />  Why would he get that basic fact wrong? If I checked that fact why wouldn't anyone else?<br /> Sadly i'm contiplating putting this book on the shelf. I feel cheated so early into the book.<br />  I do believe we have been visited and that Roswell happened, i just don't believe the late Mr. Corso..
0449000729|5.0|This book tells the story of England from the prehistoric era nearly to the present through the lens of a few specific families. Facts and details of history are cleverly woven with fiction to move you through time. Many of the characters are likable and interesting and you meet many generations. It is interesting to see how the fate or destiny of a family changes completely over time, and how the past for any family it eventually lost to time. Nothing gets remembered forever despite the effort. It really makes you wonder about your own families past. What secrets and surprises lie in your heritage? You will learn a great deal about England. If you are a fan of historical fiction, or just an Anglophile, you will love this book. I look forward to reading his other books about London and other regions of the world.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel, \\"To Be Chosen\\"
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This DVD is AMAZING! Pink Floyd is my all time favorite band and if I could meet one musician it would be David Gilmour. This concert is phenomenal. I think if I would have seen it in person my head might have exploded. It was pretty close to popping off just watching the DVD. What an amazing show!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app works great on my EvO...this is much better than the original the graphics look phenomenal on my HTC EVO and I rather save other birds than look at thoes ugly green Piggies...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|can't wait to see how this goes...the movie is out April 16th! I'd love to see some in-app add-ons - special birds, special enemies...I love it
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Best angry birds game yet. Runs flawlessly on the EVO 4G and I love that there are no ads. Now I just need to find all of the pineapples!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|After downloading this app,i soon discovered the graphics to be much better and for new levels involving monkeys which are pretty comical.the levels seem to be a little easier.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Hands down the best Angry Birds game I've played by far. I've played them all and this is the best. I use the HTC EVO on Sprint the now network.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have been patiently waiting for some sort of update from the angry birds franchise and here it is. I'm addicted once again. This game will not disappoint.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Downloaded the app yesterday and its just awesome. There has been many graphical improvements that add a nice touch to the game atmosphere.  I have a Droid Incredible and it plays just fine. Whoever is having issues isn't doing something right and don't give this game 1 star if you suck at life.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|All the one star ratings i saw were either rating it badly because of an incompatibility with their Droid X, or the fact that AMAZON does not allow installation overseas.  AMAZON, NOT ANGRY BIRDS.  You people are stupid and are unjustly negatively skewing the customer review score.  go to BBB and complain about amazon, dont do it ON A PRODUCT
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The ad-supported version of this game caused my evo shift to chunk and run poorly, and the recent update that introduced full-screen video ads had me debating uninstalling the game. No more! I wanted a paid app and this delivers a smooth lag-free and low-data experience.  standard angry birds review from here out - this game is addictive and just challenging enough to really be engaging in a way games haven't been since the advent of the save point. Well worth the paid download!
B004R92PYE|4.0|I was disappointed when P!ATD left behind their signature, over-the-top theatrics.  I do think it's important to respect musicians' need to grow and experiment, though.  I think part of the reason this album is as good as it is, is because of Pretty.Odd.  In Vices & Virtues, Panic! returns to that original sound that fans love, but brings with it a greater maturity and improved songwriting.  Fast tempos and heavy strings make for a seriously fun listen.  'Hurricane' has the most addictive hand-clap percussion and shout-along chorus--I can't quit listening to it, so awesome.    It's true that Vices & Virtues doesn't have the same bite of their old lyrics, and I do miss that.  But honestly, it can't be healthy to be that angry and bitter all the time, so if Brendon wants to croon melancholy love songs, I'm good with that.  'Always,' a ballad of acoustic guitar, is particularly beautiful.  Brendon's singing has improved so much since their debut.  He's completely left behind  the emo yell/sing, and this is him at a vocal peak.  What a voice!    I think Vices & Virtues takes their old style and marries it with the maturity of Pretty.Odd.  I bumped a star off for some songs like 'Memories', which are nice but kind of forgettable.  That said, if you were a fan of their first style, give Vices & Virtues a shot; I'm so happy they're back.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Practically flawless on the EVO 4G! Amazing and fun version of angry birds !!! (: I love it. Great story plot must save the birds they should be free to fly not stuck in a cramped cage.
B0041CGP02|5.0|my sister is a major child of the 80's and thinks Jon Bon Jovi is the King. Got this for her after for a welcome home gift after she worked out of the states for a few months. She loves it, me well I do not like riding in her car *sigh.
B003Y74AXO|4.0|If you've used screen protectors for your smartphone or other device, you already know what this product does.     Frankly, I am not a big fan of screen protectors. They tend to be hard to apply and even harder to remove. But despite my distaste for putting anything  over my iPad's screen, I have to say that this product delivers  what it promises. It cleans and protects the iPad's screen.    The only thing that I can add is that my iPad has a couple of scratches on it's screen. This is nothing that stops me from using the device. But it does make me wish that I had reconsidered my bias against screen protectors for my devices. So go ahead and order this product. It is reasonably priced and will protect and clean your iPad's screen
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is well worth the 99cents! You get to keep all your records while getting rid of the ads! Works well with Droid2. Thank you rovio and amazon app store!
B004J4WQ46|2.0|Since the release of \\"Is This It\\", The Strokes have (arguably) managed to one-up themselves with each subsequent album.  I wish I could say that \\"Angles\\" is, at the very least, as good as their last one.  Sadly, this is not the case.  The chorus guitar riff in \\"Machu Picchu\\" (the opening track) is the high point of this album, and I found myself saying \\"that one was ok\\" to myself a few times during my first couple of listens.  These are honestly the most positive things I can say about it.  When I first heard \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\", I was overjoyed, as it was clear that my biggest hope regarding The Strokes had come true--Julian had FINALLY started taking himself seriously as a singer!  More complex melodies, cleaner vocals (while maintaining his trademark grit), broader ranges, and--wait for it--HARMONIES!  Unfortunately, it seems that song was polished to sell, and serves mainly as false advertising for the rest of the album, which is mostly sleepy songwriting, droning vocals, and awkward synth sounds that completely dislocate The Strokes from their once-sharp rock edge.  Very disappointing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The best game out there for my HTC EVO 4G. I started playing and I could not stop best game ever on Android. The graphics the color the music the sound its all perfectly balanced truly a rewarding game experience.
B003ELKNH2|1.0|I purchased this to show my students in connection with our unit on Heart of Darkness. I chose this version because it was significantly cheaper than the original. Bad choice. The scenes that were added include gratuitous sex and violence. They add nothing to the story line. It is clear why they were not included in the original. Advice is to spend a few extra dollars and get the original.
B004L49K20|5.0|As a fan of Duran Duran from the begining, I have stayed with them through the good, the bad and the ugly. The amazing thing here is that this is a great, great ALBUM.  Duran Duran have never been known as an album band.  It's mostly been about the singles. And even as a die hard fan, i have to say that I havn't loved a Duran album from begining to end since 7 and the Ragged Tiger album. This album changes that.  From the itunes version that was released in December, i was floored. I couldn't beleive how excellent these songs are.  Since puchasing the hard copy of the CD and watching the special edition DVD, i have a deeper fondness for these songs. Yes, the first two DD albums influence this album heavily.  \\"...Leopard\\" is basically The Chauffer part2, but with a twist. That song along with \\"Leave a Light On\\" and \\"Before the Rain\\" are the albums stunning ballads. \\"Leave a light On' has a Save a Prayer sound to it with a dash of \\"Come Undone\\".  \\"Being Followed\\", which NEEDS to be a single, and \\"Girl Panic\\" are a modern day \\"Girls on Film\\".  I cant remember the last time a Duran Duran song had a chorus that was just embedded in my brain and I sang along to like this.  Probably a radio single from the 80's.      Many bands try to re-create the sound that made them famous and fail because it sounds cheap or intentional.  This collection of songs do not fall victim to this.  They stand alone very well and do not sound forced.  The only complaint i have about this album is that Simon's voice sounds a little too high/whiny on certain cuts and i strongly feel as though, \\"All you Need Is now\\" should not have been a single.  It doesn't fit on this album and i don't feel as though it is a representaion of this album.  It's almost like hearing \\"I Dont Want Your Love\\" on the Rio album.     As a long time fan, I am very excited about this album as Im sure the band is. I can tell you one thing, it will be very hard for me to listen to some of the lack luster DD albums again afterhearing this.  The critics and fans crucified DD for the Red Massacre album, which i liked, but I don't think this will be the case here.  As a matter of fact, with the right promotion and carefully chosen singles, this album might actually be the one to appeal to the younger generation.
031250926X|5.0|Not all board books are equal!  We have about ten, but my daughter only really has interest in this one and Goodnight Moon.  (I have a seven and a half month old.)  Reasons why it is great:<br /><br />*It has a simple, rhyming, sing-song text that babies love<br />*It is brightly colored, but not overwhelming<br />*It has slide and find pictures, so it incorporates a peek-a-boo game into the book<br />*It is just the right length for a short attention span<br />*It is very durable (my daughter chews on it every time after we finish reading it, but I haven't noticed very much wear unlike her other books!)<br /><br />The panels are somewhat difficult to slide at first, but they have gotten easier with time. If they were too easy to slide, then they would slide open with gravity if the book was tilted.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This was the first blue ray movie I've ever seen, and I must say that the difference between regular hi-def and blue ray high def is just like the difference between regular hi-def and standard def.  Sony wins this one hands down.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I'm using Splashtop Remote to control my iMac using the Motorola XOOM tablet.   Remotely watching video or listening to music works flawlessly for me, but there's one HUGE drawback - you can't type.  It seems as if the key presses aren't making their way over to the Mac, so unless I can get around using only clicks, the app is useless to me.  Add to that the poor resolution choinces for the tablet, and not being fully Honeycomb optimized....and this one is a pass for now.    Hopefully the developer steps up with some updates to bring this app in line with the iOS and Android phone offerings.
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|Homeowners will be well suited educating themselves about whether to use a brad nailer or a finishing nail gun for the particular project they are interested in completing.  There is some degree of confusion around this matter and I think using the right tool for the right project will lead to the right results.  There are plenty of online resources and woodworking forums to advise on this matter.  Having a good quality 18 gauge brad nailer is cost effective and indispensable as in many ways it is the most versatile of all of the nailers for a typical homeowner.      I used this the day after I received it on a basic furniture project and I am not disappointed.  I see myself using this for some trim work projects in the near future as well.  It is very comfortable in my hand (both weight and balance) and at 3 pounds I could see my using it for an extended period of time on larger projects without fatigue.      The brad nailer came with a plastic Makita logo case (seems plenty durable and was a nice touch as increasingly manufacturers omit this basic convenience).  It also included oil and safety goggles (funny the manual for the goggles was 46 pages due to all the foreign languages).      The halo effect might be coming into play a little on this review as I have four other Makita tools.  All four of which I have had phenomenal results with over an extended period of time.  I will post updates as I use this brad nailer for more projects.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I just hopped onto the Mumford & Sons train with the release of this album, and I can tell I've been missing something big.  Amidst all of the watered-down music we hear being pumped out of the machine, Mumford & Sons gives us a breath of the freshest air, taking us on an amazing folky/stringy/bluegrassy journey through their well-timed melodies and amazing harmonies.  This album is nothing short of fantastic, and I'm glad to know that they'll be playing at the 2011 Wakarusa Music Festival this summer.  Go check them out!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just am absolutely great game to the franchise. It can make a slow day fly by fast. works great on my Droid Incredible. No bugs and no errors. A very solid game that's fun for all ages!
B003EY7IRC|2.0|I tried my best to like the main character, could not after many times reading the book(and the serie) to give her a chance at the end I had to give up. she is not very clever. if not for the other characters of the book that makes the plot and story interessting I would'nt have bought this one.  this hero is no hero but a want to be hero.  true and faithfull fans will love it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|like the graphics.  fun and addictive. not just for the usa, works in Canada just fine on the HTC legend.  I get sad tho to think of waiting til May for the 3rd world.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|None of the other reviewers so far have mentioned the other capabilities of the app, besides its ability to do and explain complicated math. I use this app to look up stocks, populations, random trivia like the odds of poker hands and the birthdays of actors, and calculate the number of calories in my breakfast. It does a ton, and although you can just use the mobile website, the app works well and it's nice to give a couple bucks to the people involved in making this awesome tool. The math/symbols keyboard that pops up is great, too, and makes punching in obscure symbols easy.
B004NOH9LW|4.0|Great movie although, they could have done a little better job  with the ending. wasn't really a closed ending. maybe a sequel??
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was looking for something new to read, and this book was on sale. I had never heard of it or the author, so I didn't have much hope for it. I have been hooked from page one, though! This is one of the best books I've read since Gabaldon's Outlander series!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|its a good angry birds... like the changes they made. looking forward to the updates in may,June and the rest of the year! oh I also like how there are no commercials during the game!
0756404738|5.0|Several reviews have focused on the oddly-shaped plot, in that our title character, after 1000 pages, is geographically right back where he started, and developmentally not a whole heck of a lot further away than that.<br /><br />This is true but incidental to the question of whether or not this is a good book. Perhaps the expectation is that, by the end of book two in a trilogy, Our Hero ought to have vanquished at least one evil arch-villain, and certainly he ought to have fought in the Battle of Helm's Deep. Instead, our hero learns some languages, hangs out with cultures alien to him, makes (and loses) some friends, and discovers he is both very good and also completely clueless when it comes to the opposite sex. The largest battle in the book -- if you could call it that -- has thirty people, most of whom don't do anything. Wise Man's Fear acquits itself well as a self-contained novel, avoiding the middle child trap: enough is resolved to satisfy the reader while the long-term plot threads are developed just enough to hold our attention for a couple of years until the trilogy is finished.<br /><br />A lot of fantasy authors hit you over the head with their Epic scale. They've put so much research and effort into developing their creation that they want you to 'get it,' and so inundate you with the various languages, cultures, and histories that comprise their universe. Forced narratives deliver a mountain of exposition to show off how detailed their fantasy universe is. And it may well be that Rothfuss' world is not appreciably more epic or more detailed than, say, Sanderson or Tolkien, but Rothfuss knows how saturated the entire genre has become and isn't trying to sell us his story because the plot is any better, or even really any different, than every other fantasy series. It's not the story: it's the storytelling.<br /><br />Rothfuss lets us in on this notion with Kvothe's own Edema Ruh, the nomadic band of troupers in which the main character spends his early years. To paraphrase Kvothe's own explanation, most troupers and bards know the same stories, just as most everyone has heard the best stories and songs before. What makes Wise Man's Fear and Name of the Wind compelling is that they are told so artfully. The characters and the world itself are not narrated in a top-down fashion; rather, we learn about them just as Kvothe does: as a teenager discovering everything for the first time. The 'Chronicler' is writing down Kvothe's story as he tells it, and no doubt has some experience with Amazon.com reviews, as he even complains on a couple occasions that Kvothe is glossing over something that is surely of interest, and Kvothe shrugs it off; he's telling his story his way, and he gets to decide what's important.<br /><br />Rothfuss has been compared to George R. R. Martin, and while both are easily among the finest living fantasy authors around today, they are otherwise nearly incomparable. Martin is weaving a gigantic, elaborate web of relationships and betrayals, and one imagines that the gears started turning over at HBO as soon as the first book of 'Song of Ice and Fire' was finished. Rothfuss is less ambitious and more focused, in part because his story, like so many of Kvothe's own stories, has more in common with an oral tradition than it does with era-spanning gargantuans: it is the proverbial old man by the fireplace to Martin's HBO spectacular. To some, this is a shortcoming, but it's what makes Rothfuss unique. It is probably impossible, or at least inadvisable, to translate The Kingkiller Chronicle to the screen. Its strength is not in a meticulously crafted machine of moving parts, like Martin's Westeros; this story relies entirely upon the sheer force of personality behind both its protagonist, Kvothe, and Rothfuss himself.<br /><br />In other words: this is possibly the only story out of the modern fantasy genre that I would ever want to read aloud. The plot isn't always consistent, and maybe some of the architectural beams creak under the weight of it at times, but one imagines that Rothfuss is as unconcerned with that as he'd like us to be: he's traveling around with his trouper's wagons and he wants us to believe that the delivery matters as much as the content. There's nobody else like Rothfuss out there right now, and even if Kvothe isn't sufficiently 'epic' for some readers, he and many of the other characters have a lot more to say about the simple and confounding business of being human than anything else you'll find in the fantasy section.weight of it at times, but one imagines that Rothfuss is as unconcerned with that as he'd like us to be: he's traveling around with his trouper's wagons and he wants us to believe that the delivery matters as much as the content.

B00127RAJY|5.0|So, after reading numerous reviews about \\"30 Day Shred\\"  I was excited to give it a try. Got my DVD and my weights  ( also by JM) in the mail yesterday and this morning started level 1. It was INTENSE. I really felt like giving up 2 or 3 times during the workout, but JM kept me motivated and I had to keep reminding myself that if I started doing this, I need to do this right, or no results. If you break it down- they all are simple moves, but tied together with no break in between- that's what makes them hard. I hated side lunges. At the end of the workout I was soaking wet and my knees would not bend. And now I am feeling exhausted and just slumping on the couch, writing this review. Oh, and when I took a shower, I could barely lift up my arms to wash my hair- I know, too much information, but I wanted the people who are going in , to know what they are up to. But I am proud I made it through and am looking forward to the next intense, painful 30 days. Will be posting results as I go, in 5 days intervals.<br /><br />UPDATE:  20 days later- no significant weight loss, but body is definitely more toned and slimmer. I can proudly say I have biceps and some definition of abs now. These results are after 20 days of every day workout, no slacking, but with no diet. I kept eating whatever I was eating before, just started reading labels. Trust me: reading labels will get you more conscious of what you eat. It is scary what we put into our bodies. Also, I noticed, since this workout is so intense, I don't feel like eating junk, because then all my hard work will be undone. I definitely recommend this workout!
0312430000|5.0|It's ironic that this book, which isn't an explicit \\"to-do\\" work, has examples of overseas soap bars, anti-infection hospital procedures, and every member of the U.S. Airways flight crew that survived a Hudson River crashdown with zero casualties (where Dr. Gawande clearly and correctly brings out that Capt. Sullenberger was one brilliant member of a collectively all-brilliant team effort to plan for and then avert a disaster scenario) that should resonate for readers who want to organize their own lives with more clarity. I've used some of the broad ideas in this novel since returning from a holiday trip to Florida right after 2011 began and they're pretty damn useful! And the David Lee Roth example makes so much sense, and spins off such a strange story (the no brown M&Ms rule), that it'd be worth buying this book just to read it. Fortunately, the rest of what Dr. Gawande has to say is as fun to read as it is intellectually engaging. No one who opens up the pages here will regret it, sincerely.
B004LSJCJM|3.0|I have been a huge fan of Joes since 2003. I have every recording he has ever done. This cd is good but not great. I thought his last cd was not so good and I was really looking forward to a killer cd this time around. The solos are complex as normal but it just seems like there is no creativity in these solos just speed. Dust Bowl does have some amazing tracks though. Just not enough. Prisoner and the Whale song are excellent. Personally I think Joe makes to many cds. I beleieve in quality over quantity.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game!!! Its really addictive and the graphics are way nicer than older versions...i haven't had any technical issues with this game just pure fun
B004BLJQOK|1.0|If you are wanting to see what the Americans do to re-invent this Swedish film - then don't watch this - they don't change a thing. It is pretty much the same, frame by frame.<br /><br />Why the hell did they remake it!? What a waste! I wonder if the Americans will do the same thing with Dragon Tattoo. How Pointless!!! What a waste of money and time and UGGH!!!!<br /><br />They took out the scene where the woman gets attacked by cats...which was kinda cool. Also, the acid melted face was more realistic in the original movie. Oh and the CGI of her hunting in the American version kinda reminded me of the pitiful scenes in the new Star Wars movies where Yoda was doing his ninja tricks. And to top it all off...the movie still looked foreign even though it was filmed in America. Most of the actors looked pretty similar. Abby still looked like a boy. Her care taker looked the same.<br /><br />I give this film the most pointless remake award. I don't particularly like either movie...it's not the worst thing I have ever seen. It's just very slow and boring. I think Interview with the Vampire is probably the only good vampire film I have ever seen, multiple things actually happen in it as opposed to this story where, really you can edit the whole move down to 5 minutes. It is a very simple story. Not the worst, just simple and long and drawn out.<br /><br />Oh and if you are looking for something scary - this isn't. Maybe try \\"White Noise\\" (and watch the extra features too)if you are looking for scary. If you want something scary and visually amazing try \\"The Cell\\". Both these movies will stimulate your brain a little bit more than Let Me In.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|After reading the reviews here I took the safe route and rented this movie.  I went into the film thinking it may be bad, but I would give it a chance.  I am glad I did.  I think the film was shot beautifully and that the actors played their parts well.  The story was fine - it wasn't Shakespeare but I wasn't disappointed.  If you want to watch a film that is reminiscent of old Hollywood intrigues (not dependent on tons of nudity and profanity) then I think you will be pleased.  Just enjoy it for what it is, a light romp - not mentally streaching but enjoyable, like a nice white wine with some cheese and fruit instead of a heavy red and a big steak... okay, now I'm hungry :-)
B002JVWRAO|5.0|this season was great it had an amazing ending and amazing episodes and its hard to tell what happens next but they should have had it where people had more hope in the angels winning and should have made it so it seems the angels actually have a chance in winning against the devil cause at first it didnt seem like they were going to win

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Wow this morning this had like 300 reviews and now over 700. I always begin my reviews by saying that I almost never review stuff unless there really is a big reason.<br /><br />I'm reviewing this because it has a ton of undeserved 1 star ratings. There's a ton of reviews complaining because the Amazon Appstore didn't work or the game didn't install. I understand this can be frustrating but that doesn't mean the game is bad.<br /><br />Now for a lot of people (including me) it did work on my two devices and it's free so I'm pretty happy.<br /><br />1. [[ASIN:B0047Q9GT4 Coby Kyros MID7015 7-Inch Android  Internet Touchscreen Tablet - Black]] This is one of the cheapest tablets ever. The first angry birds doesn't work to well, you can't see all the graphics. This one works great, the graphics work 95%. no problems installing Amazon appstore or the game. It runs smooth enough. I'm not in the US, so it's not true that it doesn't work outside the US.<br /><br />2. Now on my cell phone (LG GW620, Amazon apparently is not selling anymore so no link) it's usually harder to get stuff not meatn for outside the US because the carrier and GPS give out your location. Well I had no problem here either, installed Amazon Appstore with no problem, when I tried to get the app it said it was already on my list of apps so I just had to re-download it. App worked fine but Angry birds is pretty slow on this phone (600 Mgz processor), still seemed a bit faster than the normal angry birds.<br /><br />Since I'm outside the US and the tablet is not a cell phone, I used the email option to send the Amazon Appstore app to my tablet and phone and worked like a charm.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for this, who doesn't like free stuff? Didn't work for you and your fancy phone? Well don't complain, it cost you nothing, OMG you spent 5 minutes on this for nothing !! Thing about the people in Japan before you complain about losing 5 minutes of your life. 20 steps for nothing? Did your finger fall off? Get a life.<br /><br />Now, I can't buy stuff from the Android Marketplace cause there's no Google checkout in my country so I'm wondering if I can buy stuff from the Amazon Appstore, let's try with Uno (wife loves that game).<br /><br />Anddddd it worked, I was able to buy the app and install it on my Tablet.<br /><br />So I got the cheapest tablet, the cheapest phone, I'm outside the US and it all worked well for me.

B004GHBQ7O|3.0|Loved the CD and listening to the DVD. Watching the DVD was another story. The director loves using blurry shots and the entire thing seems like 2 second clips spliced together. Don't get me wrong, I love Green Day but watching this gave me a headache. I guess I should have known because the same guy did the Bullet in a Bible DVD, sorry Mr. Dugan. Maybe some extras next time too, that was the best part about the last DVD.  Green Day has been around for a LONG time, I would have expected a better DVD out of them.
1401324029|5.0|This book sold by the seller was in excellent condition as noted.  The book itself is wonderful; almost better than watching the series on T.V.  Don't miss this best seller by the New York Times.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|excellent addition to the angry birds family. vibrant colors and lots of hidden extras. i am yet again addicted. this one does have an easier learning curve for newer people
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love angry birds! I love Amazon works GREAT so far! Great graphics fun game! Amazon app store is pretty easy to use! Oh and it was free! Enough said.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|With Battle: Los Angeles I expected a lot of CG effects and little plot. It was refreshing to find that the film concentrated more on the characters than glitzy effects.  This is a war movie. When Earth is invaded by aliens there are no questions about have they been watching us or what they want. The marines at the center of this drama are only concerned about their objective: rescuing civilians caught in the middle of the battle.      Battle: Los Angeles has at its core a standard story of redemption. Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) led his squad on an apparent suicide mission where he was the only survivor.  He is shunned by fellow Marines as a pariah and, in the opening scene, submits a request for retirement.  When the alien attacks begin, Nantz is assigned to serve under a newly commissioned Second Lieutenant William Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez). The other members of  the platoon resent Nantz and think he would get them all killed.  This is particularly true for Corporal Jason Lockett (Cory Hardrict) whose brother was killed in Nantz's prior mission.      As is standard for this kind of film, we get a brief glimpse into the lives of the characters. We discover that Lt. Martinez's wife is expecting a baby; another soldier is planning his wedding.  There is just enough information to provide a little insight.  The approach of the filmmakers was to take the point of view of a squad of soldiers.  Like them, we are unaware of what kinds of creatures have invaded Earth, what their weapons are and how the battle can be won.  Battle: Los Angeles could have been very mediocre but for the excellent performance of Aaron Eckhart. He perfectly conveys the guilt he carries for being a survivor and the ends he is willing to go through to prove himself to the squad and his lieutenant. Michael Pena plays a civilian who is rescued by the squad along with his young son, nicely played by Bryce Cass.  Brigit Moynahan is good in a small role as a vet who discovers how to kill thealiens.     In all, Battle: Los Angeles will probably remind you of other war films but it has enough suspense and good performances to keep you on the edge of your seat. The CG effects are good and are not used for mindless dazzle.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This DVD series is absolutely laugh-out-loud hysterical!  It's great to see the characters form into who they are from the beginning.  I can perfectly understand why they received the Emmy award for the best comedy series of the year.  It's hard to pick which family or even family member is the funniest as they are all so very comical - in realistic ways.  I have recommended this series to many people and have been thanked for the \\"gift\\" of laughter that I have given to those who have never seen it before but are now watching on a weekly basis.  If you haven't seen the first season and just need to catch up and watch the first season, I highly recommend this DVD.  It will not disappoint.  It's one of the best series on television today!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|This will not install on my cruz T-103 7 inch tablet. It also give insufficent memory when installing on my HTC Hero phone. Good thing I didn't pay anything upfront.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This app is the best! Having the ability to check my son's homework is GREAT! Not only do we get the answer, but it shows how the [math] problem is worked. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT! Droid X.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Lots of versions are included. Some versions are downloadable for offline use and some versions also have audio! You can share verses with your facebook and twitter accounts, too!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This game is by and large the same as Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons, but the art work is revamped. If you like Angry Birds, this game is for you, but there is not enough new content and it is lacking in difficulty so if you didn't like the first two you  won't like this one either.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This will not install on my cruz T-103 7 inch tablet. It also give insufficent memory when installing on my HTC Hero phone. Good thing I didn't pay anything upfront.
B004GYY714|5.0|I tried at least a half dozen other apps and this is the 1st that works like it supposed to on my HTC EVO. Streams FM, AM, and Internet Radio with ease. Buffer time is almost non existent. No loss signal. No drop out.  I would give this app 10 stars if I could. It's THAT good.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm a huge angry birds fan. I have it on my android phone, ipod touch, ipad and macbook. I have to say this is the best version yet! Please make it available for apple ipad and mac so I can use the larger screen
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Once I was able to download it I was glad I took the time to do so.   I like the better graphics on this version and the slightly different format from the other versions makes it new and not just the same old thing over again.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|works nicely on my phone with an 800 megahertze prossesor though it does lag a bit and the graphics can be kind of slow. Also takes up less space then the original and seasons.
0920668372|5.0|This is my all time favorite children's book. I read this is my doctor's office for the first time and bawled. It is so true of the relationship between my son and I. He was a very caring child and I am proud to say he is a very caring adult. I Love You Forever Taylor
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The review is for the game,not the way it is downloaded,which by the way,worked flawlessly on my droid x.The game is what you've come to expect from angry birds,but adds extra elements,such as bosses.The game is going to have the typical updates to get more levels,but actually gives you a time frame of when new levels will be available.People,please enjoy the game and dont fuss over it because its an amazon download.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I enjoyed anger birds a lot but this one is hard trying to get those darn little trophies. I like that they are going to be adding more levels soon, can't wait.
B004S8NBDI|4.0|I could not get into this record when I first heard it. My prior review was very critical. Now a week later, and after listening to this about 100x's, I must say, I have sunk my teeth into a number of tunes and I can't get enough. Very cool and imaginative album. It just takes some time to figure out the ingenuity of it all. Enjoy.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great graphics. Enough changes to make it different from the original Angry Birds, but familiar enough that it takes no time to learn. Runs great on Nexus S.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Restarts on level 2-9. On EVO rooted with 2.3.  Awesome graphics, just need to get that restart issue fixed. Love angry birds, hope this gets fixed soon.
0321344758|5.0|As designers we are constantly struggling to please our bosses, who often don't agree with the way we design things and want it done their way, which, as any designer can tell you, is never a good way. There is a reason behind our madness. Everything else is just clutter on a page. Steve Krug's book \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" helped me put my frustrations into words that others could understand, so that when I explain, \\"Element A clashes with element B,\\" or \\"This design needs to be simplified because of X, Y, and Z,\\" I'm not met with a bunch of blank stares.<br /><br />This book is excellent in every way - well written, beautifully designed, visually interesting, fun to read, and/or - if you don't have a lot of time - easy to skim through just to pick up a few pointers (though it's well worth a good read... or two.) The author writes to the experienced designer and also to the layman who's just starting out. If you're new to web design, you'll learn TONS; if you're a seasoned pro, you'll get a solid refresher and maybe even pick up on a few new things.<br /><br />And although this book is geared toward web design, there is so much in it that is applicable to graphic design in general. The title alone is a resounding example: Don't make me think. If your designs - whether for internet marketing, billboards, magazines, or whatever - require people to look twice, or think too hard, you risk losing them.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|This is a review of the format/packaging of this product, it is not in fact 4 separate ebooks, but is in fact one large ebook that has no table of contents, no index, chapter.  It has no feature to even jump ahead to a specific book at all.<br /><br />It defies the purpose an electronic document.  This is poorly put together and should not be purchased at all.  Buy the books separatly.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm not an angry bird player but this game got me started.  One of the best &quot;free game&quot; available.   Download and enjoy.  graphics is great.  Simple to play.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game alot better then the original. I like seeing the birds fly, although I hate this 25 word minimum on posting a darn review... Amazon fix!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Wow,  got this on day one and for free. HTC G2.  Highly recommend it,  if you give it less than five stars, you suck. Great
B00008PW2D|1.0|The title of this review says it all. My husband got me this season from a discount movie shop for $5. No way we'd be willing to pay full price for a piece of a season.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I loved the original versions. I enjoy the new story and graphics over the original versions. Give it a try. i recommend you download today :)
B004KA9MQO|3.0|First of all, I need to get this out...this CD is 100 times better than her debut outing.  Now, that we got that out, let's get to her new CD, \\"I Remember Me.\\"  We all know Ms. Hudson has been through some things since her debut and she has risen like a Phoenix.  With this new CD, she shows that same resilience and strength but with various results.  I will admit that I'm a music snob and I tend to like either the more earthy singers (i.e. Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Adele, Marsha Ambrosius, and Algebra) or the old school divas (i.e. Chaka Khan, Gladys Knight, Anita Baker, and Phyllis Hyman).  Jennifer falls somewhere in between the latter mentioned artists.  I will call these artists the commercial divas (i.e. Whitney Houston in her heyday, Vanessa Williams, Beyonce, and Alicia Keys).  These divas have talent beyond belief but they want to sell (meaning: make big money) CDs too.  They will only gives us listeners a taste of their talents on their CD efforts and they will save the really good stuff for their live shows.  The results from this type of artist are what we have with the new CD by Ms. Hudson.  Vocally, Ms. Hudson delivers the goods.  When I first her the first single, the grammatically challenged \\"Where You At\\", I was like eh...but when I saw her sing this song live on the Oprah Winfrey Show, I was like wow, she sung that song.  She makes mediocre songs like the Diane Warren penned, \\"Still Here\\" or the song \\"Gone\\", which sounds like a Rhianna reject song, tolerable.  In other areas she takes us to the edge (the powerful Stargate produced \\"I Got This\\", finger popping \\"No One Gonna Love You\\", and the marching band with soul sounding \\"Angel\\").  When she finally delivers the passion you were expecting (\\"Why is it so Hard\\", the nod to her home town of Chi-Town with the House music inspired \\"Don't Look Down\\", and the gospel tingling \\"Believe\\"), you will find yourself pressing repeat for these songs.  So, what we have is a good CD, not the best we music snobs thinks she can deliver but not bad like some of the junk that has come out recently from the big music companies.  I will continue to wait for that all encompassing CD from Ms. Hudson but in the meantime, I got this....
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is the best angry birds yet. I loved the surprise at the end of the jungle theme. sneaky AI!!  I am ready for updates!
B004J4WQ46|4.0|Angles is a really GOOD album. But it really stops there. To me the struggles of this album even coming together stemmed from the negative reactions their last album, First Impressions of Earth, received. To me The Strokes first 3 albums were 100% 5-star albums, each perfect and unique in its own way. I realize how different FIOE came across to even the most die-hard Strokes fan but I truly admire that album for it's true confidence. It was a milestone from a band unafraid to dip a toe in unfamiliar territory and that only added to the excitement and mystery for us fans to wonder, \\"Whatever will they try next?!\\" FIOE was like a statement for their fans as if to say, \\"This is what we're into writing right now. If you dig it, GREAT! If not, it's all good.\\" The Strokes had faith in their fans and unfortunately many abandoned them. But regardless of how negative \\"fans\\" were towards FIOE it should never have stopped them from going in whatever direction they wanted to.    This is where my issues with Angles arise. To me, this album beginning to end sounds like The Strokes trying to sound like The Strokes rather than play and create what feels natural. Even the interior photography strongly resembles a glossier version of the Is This It? photos. It's like they want us to be reminded that they're still \\"Jenny from the block.\\" The problem is for those of us that love them simply because they write great songs and not just because their \\"cool\\" people, we don't really need to fall in love with them again because we've never stopped. We don't need a \\"return to form\\" because we like where they were headed and would follow them no matter what! I seem to be in the minority that doesn't LOVE \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" and my reasoning is that this song out of all 10 on Angles sounds the most of all overly worked it's not even funny. I mean I understand being meticulous but there comes a point where you just gotta back away from a song and leave it be. \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" is like a compromising backwards step for them and a message to those unnerved \\"fans\\" as if they're saying \\"Look we can still write a song like \\"Last Nite!\\" Whereas past singles i.e. \\"Last Nite\\" \\"Reptilia\\" and \\"Juicebox\\" just rolled with the punches with brilliant fluidity, there's just TOO dang much going on with this new single. It's not a BAD song but it's something we've heard them do much better in the past. Almost every song on this album sounds like things couldn't be entirely agreed on or something. The standouts for me on this album are \\"Taken for A Fool\\" \\"You're so Right\\" \\"Games\\" and \\"Life is Simple in the Moonlight.\\" To me these songs BELONG on the same album and display The Strokes we love but with some very interesting new ideas. It's them once again unafraid to grow as a band. YES there is an obvious Radiohead influence on \\"You're so Right\\" and I would even argue I hear a little \\"Satellite\\" by Guster going on with \\"Life is Simple in the Moonlight\\" to an extent. I'm not arguing for what's ALL 100% uninfluenced and what's not because let's face it, EVERYONE is influenced by something and no one, NOT EVEN RADIOHEAD is 100% original. But these songs to me are the most fluid sounding of the album. A lot of everything else, particularly \\"Gratisfaction\\" and \\"Metabolism\\" hint at some great ideas but never quite get there. A lot of it just sounds incomplete. The tools are there but some songs don't seem to be as melodically built as well as in past Strokes albums. Now people keep saying \\"this is it for the Strokes.\\" I mean I think that's a bit of a stretch. As I've said this is still a really good album. But I just hope The Strokes will get back to making albums for themselves and trust that fans will stick by them no matter what. I know a lot of people jumped ship after FIOE but even though Angles isn't my favorite out of the four, I will be a Strokes fan till the day I die. For me they have nothing to prove anymore and can do anything they want. But that's exactly what I want them to do is to write songs for THEMSELVES and whatever people say about it is just what they say. They don't need to try to win people over because there's always going to be people who just can't be swayed back no matter what. Again, Angles is really good and if you even LIKE The Strokes there are some definite cool, fluid, catchy in a good way moments here. I would love to say this album is a masterpiece and their best ever, they've outdone themselves yadda yadda yadda. But I want to be fair and honest. And it seems even the members themselves know this isn't the best thing they've ever done. Like I said, The Strokes don't have a \\"bad\\" song in them, regardless of what you haters say about \\"15 Minutes\\" haha. But next time around I just want The Strokes to be themselves and the truest fans will always stick by them no matter what.
1594202842|2.0|In all the hubbub about this book, some sad episodes have been overlooked.  The most heartbreaking, worse than the way Chua berates and reviles her children, was when her mother-in-law, a vibrant, accomplished woman, \\"begged for\\" one full day with each grandchild.  Chua didn't even consider it, as it would have required time away from the demanding regimen of winning prizes and impressing people.  That loving grandmother is now dead, but Chua doesn't reflect on the choice she made: valuing prizes and accolades over her children's relationship with their grandmother.  Elsewhere Chua congratulates herself on how wonderful she was to take in this grandmother when she was ill with leukemia.  Chua's husband indicated his worry about how the two women would coexist, how his mother would cope with the screaming rages Chua aimed at her daughters.  But Chua volunteered to take grandma in anyway.  \\"It's the Chinese way\\", she said, since in her opinion \\"Western parents get thrown into nursing homes when they're old\\" (an example of how little Chua knows about average Americans.)  But wait!  What's this?  Did grandma come to stay?  Why no!  She stayed with the Chua family for a mere month, then was shuttled back to her apartment, where she died alone.  This is the Chinese way that Chua can't stop bragging about?    Another telling but neglected incident:  Chua ran over her daughter's foot.  She blamed the child for getting out of the car too quickly while she was backing up.  Picture it.  Was hard charging Chua to blame, too self-absorbed to step on the brake?   No, no, it was Sophia's fault!  On the bright side, \\"at least it gave her a lot of time to practice the piano.\\"    The children had pet rabbits at one point.  Chua hated the rabbits as they were \\"unintelligent\\".  She claims she would have nothing to do with them.  But the rabbits \\"mysteriously escaped\\".   Chua as Glenn Close.    Chua credits her children's accomplishments to their being Chinese.  Their Jewish American father, a man of normal American upbringing, bright and accomplished, gets no credit.  But let's examine Chinese accomplishments vs. Jewish ones, using Chua's favorite proof of superiority: prizes.  And let's look at real prizes, not the gold stickered school certificates that Chua goes gaga over.  Jews won 163 Nobel prizes in the last hundred years, despite being a tiny minority (13 million today).  The billion Chinese people that Chua reveres have won a total of ten Nobel prizes, if you include Americans of Chinese ancestry.  Chua cites a few obscure studies to prove the greatness of Chinese methods of child raising, but you'd think she'd have noticed that the prizes of childhood don't prove anything except that some children have rabid stage mothers.      Chua's ideas are the only ones that count.  She dictates every move her children make, puts herself at the center of every incident, and worships herself.  She says, \\"My last name is Chua...and I love it.\\"    She informs her daughter that following rules and winning prizes is all that matters, then says, \\"I was deeply moved by my oration.\\"  She describes the activity of her months old baby as \\"watching me have writer's block.\\"  Her own daughter told her, \\"You're a showoff.  It's all about you.\\"  Though her husband attempts to serve as buffer between her and the children, in the book he never shows the backbone required to win an argument with this termagant.      Born in the U.S., Amy Chua considers herself a \\"Chinese mother\\".  An American who showed such prejudice and disdain for another country as Chua shows for the U.S. would be called an Ugly American.  Chua regards the United States with contempt; her favorite insult is calling something \\"typical American\\".  (And unfortunately, by the end of the book, her daughters are talking like this too.)  Chua doesn't seem well acclimated to this country, and sometimes comes off as a foreigner, such as when she describes what she considers inane sports encouragement, claiming to quote parents as saying \\"Go team spirit\\".  (!)  She demands that her daughters make toasts at a party for her husband's 50th birthday, oblivious to the vulgarity of children delivering toasts, even though one daughter had the good taste to be repelled by the idea and refuse.    How did this deluded woman become a Yale professor?  Chua says she interviewed for a job at Yale, where her husband already taught.  She didn't do well and wasn't called back.  Some time later she was suddenly and mysteriously offered a tenured position at Yale.  She claims this was due to one paper she wrote.  I suspect there's more to this story...    How does a working mother have the time to hover over her children for most of the day?  She admits to skipping out during her office hours to drive the children around to their many appointments, and one has to wonder why there is no consequence for her casual attitude toward work.  She admits to taking her girls out of school for music lessons, driving them for many hours hither and yon, returning them to school after.  At home she dominates marathon practices, schoolwork and tutors.  The lax work schedule of a tenured professor in the Ivy League is obviously something to envy, though it also makes a reader question her high opinion of the Chinese work ethic.  Or perhaps that ethic only applies to children.    Chua reveals herself to be a racist and a snob.  Her disdain toward anyone not of her ilk was skin crawling.  She scoffs at janitors, calls people who can't master difficult music \\"losers\\", admits to favoring her law students \\"with strict Asian parents\\".  She's very fond of the word \\"prestigious\\".  She makes the ridiculous claim \\"there are all these new books out there portraying Asian mothers as scheming, callous, overdriven people...\\"   She doesn't name any, and a reader will be hard pressed to think of one.  \\"Ethnicity was my favorite thing to talk about\\" is shown to be true by her endless \\"Chinese good/Western bad\\" prattling.    When her husband used his law degree in the public sector as a federal prosecutor in New York City, Chua's parents were appalled.  Chua has the same rigid judgments, and maps out the only acceptable path for her children -- God forbid her child should want to join the armed forces or work in government.  Chua's Chinese values are self-absorbed, scorning public service and aiming only for self-glorification and elitist prestige.  According to Chua's description of Chinese values, serving one's country isn't admirable, it's a crime.    If this was a book about stressing academic achievement, cutting out the screen time, and encouraging focused discipline in outside pursuits, it would be true.  But no one would read it.  It's Chua's screaming, raging torment of her children, her selfish inability to see any viewpoint but her own, her racist ranting about her Chinese superiority, and her ridicule of the U.S. that draw readers like rubbernecking voyeurs at a grisly accident.  Now that there's been significant blowback from horrified readers, Chua has beaten a retreat.  She's gone on TV and radio to backtrack, claiming she really didn't mean what she said, but she's already betrayed her true self.  She lacks self awareness and insight; she's a lockstep follower of a rigid plan, not even a plan of her own devising but one she inherited.  For all her vaunted education, she is incapable of examining her assumptions and working out a new path, even when her chosen path led to a self-mutilating child.  Chua's mother-in-law died without the longed for day with her granddaughters that she begged for; Chua's daughters lost forever the opportunity to have one memorable day with their grandmother.  To Chua, gloating as she gazes at her daughters' sparkly awards, she made the right Chinese decision.  Those are her Chinese values.
B0047C2IIE|4.0|I used this album around christmas, but never write a review.  My family love the music and it went well with the gathering...I just love Bing Crosby's music.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|The CD/CVD arrived earlier than stated.  It was packaged properly so no damage was incurred during shipment.  The CD/DVD were in perfect order.  They both played well.  Amazon always does a great job in packaing, shipping and ensuring that the product works when received.
B002ZG976U|2.0|If you are interested in watching good music then this is the film for you.  However, you can get great music by just watching any of the countless music video shows or PBS.  If you are expecting a great story, then you need to look elsewhere.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Amazon to the rescue again! We have a smoother and ad-free Angry Birds here. This game is so smooth, I can't figure out why these birds are still Angry. Both the free and $0.99 ad-free paid versions are great. The Rio Movie Tie-in is cute, but the action of this arcade style puzzle is a total blast. A great way to keep busy during a plane, train or bus ride. Download it today...it will not disappoint!<br /><br />HTC Droid Incredible User
B004ISVH5W|4.0|Don't understand the negative feed back for this album.  I really like it. If fact, I believe it is his second best solo cd, other than the first one.  Some high points are America and Lets Do This Thing Called Life.  It has both great ballads and fast paced gems.  Glad to see Ashcroft put out such a quality cd.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This new version of Angry Birds is excellent!  It runs so smoothly (at least for me on my G2) compared to the other 2 ad-supported games.  I think they have mad some excellent improvements!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|It's not cheap, but the sound is excellent and range is good too. The headset feels big, but it's comfortable.  I'm usually up late after the fam has all crashed, and after years of acoustic abuse my hearing is not exceptional.  I just leave this plugged into the optical output on my TV and I use it for gaming and watching the tube (which is actually tubeless).  The only thing I don't like is when it crackles or pops (which is occasional, usually when I'm going back to the kitchen, or when the batteries are failing) it hurts my ears.  I haven't timed the battery life, but it's definitely better than the 6-7 hours I've seen others report.  I bought a pair of rechargeables with a wall charger and it's all good.  I love this headset even more than I loved my Santa Cruz- still the best sound card I've ever owned.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|With open feint suport this is one of my favorite games. Convince your friends to get it and you'll be battling for high scores in no time.
B004L3AR0K|1.0|I know we all have different tastes and opinions.......but this movie just did not hold my attention at all.  Shallow, poor story line, characters not very believable.  I wasn't impressed with any part of this movie.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|great movie I watch it over and over  the only issue I have is with the digital copy which expired 1/25/11 I had it on my ipod to watch but when I lost my hard drive and had to reinstall windows which meant I had to erase and re sync my ipod I lost the digital copy   so I put in the digital copy disc only to be told it was expired yes that's right something I paid for had expired I will never pay extra for digital copy again
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i work for amazon.com and found out bout the appstore awhile back and was excited for it and with angry birds being its 1st of its exclusive apps is great..who needs an iphone when we got a droid.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|So satisfying to slice through so many different fruits. This game is an addictive time-killer, perfect for those brief moments when you don't think you have enough time to play a  whole screen of Angry Birds. Well done and runs smoothly on my lowly Optimus S.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|zzzzz zzzzzz zzzzzz same old game. i feel tired of this game angry brids is geting old when will we get some thing new zzzzzzzzzzz
B003VSVWA0|5.0|This album is classic Cohen.  Smooth, engaging and intimate.  The album was recorded live at several different cities, in several countries, on four continents.  This shows the broad appeal Leonard has.  In addition to the audio disc there is a DVD.  The video shows the showmanship he puts into each performance.  It also lets you see the connection he develops with his audience.  This maybe the secret to his long career.
B002ZG98C8|3.0|There is action, nudes, and many funny parts.  Hard to tell if this is a serious movie, or a comic one.  Starts off as Machete as a Mexican Police officer with his long Un-cut hair, and a Uniform too tight for him A slap in the face for the Mexican Police. The plot was hard to keep up with.  It was interesting with what happens next?  There are two more Machete movies coming. I think I will pass on them.  Not a family type movie for sure. It is a different type of movie. Lot of blood with his machete.  I liked Machete as a Actor, but the story was weak. If you like blood, and guts this is your movie.  Lots of laughs.....and dead bodies.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The app got downloaded onto my HTC Hero, but would not install. It claims there is not space but there is over 40M of internal storage. I think it is a problem with the Appstore.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is the best version of Angry Birds so far. The graphics are tons better, and it even runs smoother. Tons of new levels and a new adversary besides the pigs :)
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is not your complex game with all kinds of levels and enemies and a complex storyline.  This is very simple and fun with unique gameplay using the touch screen to slice fruit.  They add to the novelty by giving you fun facts about fruit. It's a well thought out simple fun game that is well worth the 99 cents!
B003U0AHBO|4.0|This movie is before he became the Robin Hood.  What lead to him bring a Out=law. or his Merry men. The movie is good, and lot of action.  Good plot.  I felt lady Marion was too much of a plain Jane, and could have use someone else as she did not have the Grace to a Lady, and the Looks to fit the part.  Russell Crowe (Gladiator\\"is a top actor, and it is a long movie.  You have to buy this one. This could be a Family type Movie. Have to see this again. :) and again!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So I have a problem...I have a crazy obsession with this game!! :)  I have beat every level for the other versions of Angry Birds...and highly anticipated the release of this Rio version.  I was not let down.  This game runs smoothly, has crisp graphics and has a fun new concept.  Its well worth your time!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|will not install on my evo despite following all the troubleshooting tips. amazon needs to fix this issue. reading all the reviews it sounds like I am definitely not the only one.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|Amazing movie. The dvd was shipped to me pretty quickly and works  great. I like watching it with the subtitles because I cannot hear all of the dialoges sometimes. Highly recommend buying it. One of the best movies ever made, hands down.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app will waste away your spring break....it is fun and time consuming. Why do I have trio write twenty five words. I said all I want to say...
0553386794|5.0|I have just started this series and am very excited to read the next one. You must be warned though there is no clear cut protagonist and antagonist.It may seem that way at first but the more you think about the characters motives they seem logical especially for the time they live in. The people that seem to be the protagonists do make fatal mistakes and they must face the consequences for them. This creates the atmosphere that no person is safe and your favorite character good die at any moment. If you want a book where the good people triumph I would not recommended this one.
B000063Y8F|4.0|Satisfied with the gadget.  It does its job.  I rated 4 because the worksmanship is not up to the brand name.  Anyway this is good and good to the eyes.
B004S8NBDI|5.0|this is a great cd by the strokes. give it a few listens like any new cd and you will love this cd.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I figured this would be more of the same as the original Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons.  I was very wrong.<br /><br />There is a lot to make you smile in this one.  Small animation as well as several surprises make this incarnation new and different.<br /><br />It is a little easier than the original, but that, in my opinion is a good thing.  I like the casual play of the game and the easier levels make it more enjoyable for me.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This movie was outstanding.  Gasland is a must-see for everyone.  Thank you to Josh Fox for exposing this horror committed by the natural gas industry.   It is now time for us to rise up and stand as one, to put the brakes on the natural gas industry before they contaminate our entire water supply; not only here in America, but in the international community as well.  You need to watch this movie and then Act, (write your congressman, demonstrate at rallys, or contribute however you can) because time is not on our side.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have the Droid X but not the latest update and it worked perfectly fine. The whole process took a bit longer than I expected but Rio is definitely impressive. The graphics are flawless and you can't beat free!
B004KA9MQO|2.0|I am huge fan of her music and 1st albut but this album is just bad, waste of money and listening
0143038419|1.0|Anyone with a good editor, money and freedom for a year could write this book.  blah, blah, blah.  I couldn't get over how self indulgent the author sounded.  And they made a movie of this trash!
B000UX6THK|5.0|I received these DVD's in the condition that I would if I purchased them from the store: unused and sealed. The only difference? This is probably much less expensive. Came quickly too using the amazon free shipping option.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|fits well with other angry bird titles. i would have to say the graphics are better and runs smoother. i also noticed the new levels that are due out are already dated
B000K7UG34|5.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend's birthday, and he absolutely loved it! It was in great shape, and it shipped extremely quickly.  I was very pleased.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this new Angry Birds Rio version. Glad to have a version without ads. runs well on both my HTC Incredible and my Motorola Xoom.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|great app on the nook color. i love it. dont post a review of the app if u are in another region. 25 word min
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I just got the Angry Birds Rio app. It's normally $0.99 but is free today, Amazon Appstore launch day. After doing so, I decided to sign out of the Amazon Appstore.  IT'S NOT EASY TO DO THAT.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is the greatest application in the world available first in the greatest country in the world... don't hate, appreciate! Seriously though, love it! Awesome game.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Just finished it. I felt the enemies this time around lacked the charisma and dumbness of the pigs. Overall a nice spin off for the series.  Nice updated graphics. Boss battles are a welcome addition, but maybe need to feel more epic?. Also no cut scene explaining why monkeys are evil.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|great game but I get Rio news ads everytime I pasue the game and try to restart a lvl. it opens my browser to a blank page will Rio news on the top. love how even the paid version seems to have ads.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great new scenes and enemies!! Lots of fun! As addictive as ever! Why is there a word minimum? When will I reach it? Seriously, still typing...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just like the versions before it, Rio is fun and addictive. All the negative reviews are from people who cannot download this app; that should reflect poorly on the appstore, not angry birds.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Really great game, very fun. Graphics are amazing, fun story line. Would love to see a sequel or possibly a prequel? The only reason I didn't give five stars is that its a little short. Great job guys.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|not much to say here, except that it works. the improvements over the regular and seasonal Angry Birds are small, but it does add to refreshing gameplay.
B004QYZATW|2.0|This is one of those movies where the preview is far better than the movie. In fact, to make the preview, they edited the clips to make the action faster and the conversations funnier. The movie trailer is thus nothing like the actual movie.     The film is also dubbed an action thriller, but there are absolutely no thrills in this movie. There are a couple mild action sequences, but they're mostly cliche and not thrilling at all.    \\"The Tourist\\" is more of a romantic comedy, but there's not really any romance. In fact, it's not even very funny. There are a few short comic clips, but not once did I let out more than a subtle chuckle.    I actually laughed a lot during the preview and thought \\"this movie is gonna be awesome\\", but it was a major let down. The roles were well acted, and Depp, Jolie and Bettany are awesome as always, but the story line just isn't there.    Add this film to the growing list of disappointing movies released so far in 2011.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|i would give this and the other android angry birds games 5-stars if we had the option to purchase it outright, sans ads. otherwise, great game!
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Browsing songs is not what you would expect from Amazon and unlike the Amazon app, you cant read our create reviews.<br />It also needs a better search and sort function to allow viewing of all $ 5.00 albums, for instance.<br />I like Amazon's web interface, but I am just using this until something better comes along like the rumored Google music store.
B00005KARJ|5.0|I received the product in a timely manner.  I've only ordered one item from this distributor, however, I think it would be a safe bet to order again.  So far, so good! I was pleased because I'd recently ordered The Lion King Platinum Edition from someone selling on Amazon and I never received the product, nor did I get my money back.  I had to take a chance and order another one, because my son is so fond of the movie, which I finally received.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|The script didn't follow exactly what we know about the historical account (they rarely do). However, they were close.  Ms. Weisz did a very good job with the material.  As an amateur historian, I am glad to have this film in my collection.
B004IM14RY|5.0|I think the best way to approach this movie is to have an open mind. Know that you are going to watch something different. Know that the entire movie takes place in a wooden box. Even before seeing the movie you may ask yourself if there is a flashback or something to break up the scenery. No.    I am surprised that when a director tries to take a risk and try something new that some people are just turned off by the idea of doing something different. One reviewer said the scenery needed to be different. Why? I actually like the way the film was made. It helps immerse you into Paul Conrad's situation rather than making you an on-looker from the the outside.    I did not feel like the movie dragged on forever. In fact I felt the opposite. The movie happens in real time, and that adds some authenticity to Paul Conrad's situation.     I also can't believe I read a review somewhere on the Internet that mentioned the movie had an anti-American theme. There was an anti-American character in the movie. That's a big difference.    Other reviewers have already mentioned the good use of lighting, the script, camera angles, etc, so I won't get into that.
B004HKE96K|5.0|It is a monumental disservice to paint the Drive-By Truckers and Southern Rock Opera into a corner by claiming that either is 'Southern Rock'.     Is the band from and the album about 'The South'? Sure. Was it a great way to sell the album? Absolutely. But, there are no Confederate flags flying over these proceedings. There are no guest appearances by Charlie Daniels or Richard Betts.     The 'opera' part - the Lynyrd Skynyrd references (particularly noted by reviewers) - those may draw a listener to the album. But the power of the album comes from songs that reveal a time and place that has many realities. A place where, as the lyrics go 'a whole lot of good people dragged threw the blood and glass'.    I read one review on Amazon that claimed that perhaps it was only necessary to listen to the track 'The Three Great Alabama Icons' once. How incredibly wrong that would be. Listen to it to remind yourself what the album is about. 'Southern Rock Opera' is about the South. It's about rock n' roll. It's about being a kid. It's about the duality of the southern thing.    Southern Rock Opera is a cultural document worth spending many hours digesting. And god damn, it's a friggin' great rock n' roll album.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I Pre ordered this cd and while it arrived late it was well worth the wait. Adele's voice is exquisite!!!
0030839939|3.0|If there was a way to give it 3.5 stars, I'd have done so. There are quite a few good points about this book. The range of topics covered is fairly comprehensive and they are covered in some detail. There are however, quite a few issues with this book which other reviewers have pointed out. The first is the outdated nature of the book. Given the tremendous advances in solid state physics, it would have made sense to update the book and add topics such as High Tc superconductivity, the integer and fractional Quantum Hall effect.   The second problem lies with the organization which could have made the book more compact. One finds that certain topics are covered in far too much detail while others get less attention.    This is still one of the better books in the field but it seriously does need an update soon.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|Here we finally have Jennifer Hudson's second release.  It's been a while since her first which won her a Grammy and life has dealt her a great many obstacles over that time.  There are some gems here and also some filler but the obvious thing that smacks the listener in the face with the first song till the end is that Jennifer has truly found her voice.  She has always displayed superb vocals with amazing range.  It showed at its best with her DREAMGIRLS songs.  On other material, though her vocals were gold, she wasn't always focused.  Now she has matured to a true artist and performer.  She has learned how to take her special gift, her voice, and use it to its fullest potential.  She knows when to reign it in and when to let it loose holding amazing notes.  The control she has over her beautiful instrument is awe inspiring.  And with this is a much more advanced ability to put strong emotions in all her songs.  Each note sung here is from her heart and it adds so much to her raw talent.<br /><br />For me the second track I GOT THIS personifies the whole cd experience.  It is a true r@b anthemic performance where Jennifer stands strong and tall as a person with all she's walked thru starting quietly and building to a powerhouse raw emotion finale.  WHERE YOU AT is of course a great track.  Alicia Keys worked with Hudson a lot here and those tracks are the true standouts.  EVERYBODY NEEDS LOVE and DON'T LOOK DOWN are upbeat dance tracks where Jennifer soars flawlessly.  ANGEL is reminiscent of a Teena Marie track and a gift to the strong vocals of Hudson.  I REMEMBER ME, STILL HERE and WHY IS IT SO HARD are the ballad type tracks here and they go from middle of the road to true r@b and totally showcase Jennifer.  The only two filler tracks are GONE and the final gospel tinged BELIEVE.  A true highlight that will gain Jennifer even new fans is her interpretation of FEELING GOOD.  So many have recorded it and she adds new flavor and purpose to this great song.<br /><br />Bottom line is listeners have always known that Jennifer Hudson was vocally gifted.  So far she has been known as the underrated AI contestant and the DREAMGIRLS queen.  On this cd she now shows herself as an r@b diva in the Aretha Franklin school.  This cd shows much promise for the career of Jennifer Hudson.  She owns each song and controls her beautiful voice with inspiring range and emotion.  Those notes she reaches will send shivers up and down your spine.  The inner strength and conviction the listener hears shows a woman who has found her place.  Even the lackluster tracks here become magic with the touch of Hudson's vocals.  Kudos to Hudson.  Highly recommended.e is listeners have always known that Jennifer Hudson was vocally gifted.

0061474355|5.0|I've read and listened to all of the Abhorsen books by Garth Nix - one of the best trilogies of all time. It is put forth as a young adult fiction...but so is Tolkien, so what does that tell you. If you like the books, check out the audio versions. The reader is Tim Curry, who absolutely makes the characters. Or go straight to the audio books - check out [...] for the downloads.<br /><br />I can re-read this triology over and over and get something new each time.<br /><br />jp
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Gameplay and graphics seem to be improved, but I hate that they got rid of the pigs because of the movie tie-in. Overall, I think it's a solid addition to the lineup.
B004L49K20|5.0|DD + Mark Ronson = Awesome! The classic DD sound we all know and love is finally back! (And the new material sounds incredible live!)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Nice enhancements to an awesome game.  improved graphics, sound and gameplay.  runs great on verizon HTC incredible. not sure why i need 25 words minimally to review this app - guess i need to go downgrade my rating for the amazon appstore.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|Excellent quality, no flaws in audio and image.  Comes with the option to download the movie and store it in the computer.
B004FOA84A|2.0|beat this in 20 minutes. way too easy. buy from the market, run through it and get a refund. it is a really good game. just too simple for me and way too quick, even for 2 bucks.
B0042KZJ46|3.0|Live Forever,Live @ Stanley Theatre is good if you are a Bob Marley completist(It was his last live show), but for any one who is a casual fan beware the last two songs. The encore of \\"Work\\" & \\"get Up, Stand Up\\" are actually taken from the secondary recording source and the audio quality is TERRIBLE(pretty much unlistenable).If you want a good BM&W live recording, get a copy of \\"Live @ The Roxy\\".
B0000AC8LR|5.0|I got this in 3-4 days, as it said, for a good price, and brand new too! I have no complaints!
B002ZG997C|3.0|I was curious to see how a post-apocalyptic yarn on preserving the Bible might unfold. The title &#34;The Book of Eli&#34; is a neat pun: Eli also means God. (see Matthew 27:46). Is Eli miraculously equipped to do what God has promised? (see Matthew 5:18).<br /><br />As TEOTWAWKI films go, it's well made and has a great look and feel. And with its impossible time frames, sequencing and martial feats, it's entertainingly fantastic. But as a preservation quest, it fails. The film labors over words and ritual and idols (talismen), but nowhere is the Lord of the Bible revealed (Jesus Christ -- &#34;Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.&#34; (Acts 4:12)).<br /><br />Ultimately it's just another book filed between the Torah and the Koran in a library in San Francisco.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Downloads fine but won't install. I'm on an HTC Evo. Looks like the same issue as the Droid X users. Someone help...I need my Angry Birds!

B00475AYJQ|2.0|If this was the First book in a series, nobody would read the second.  Everything about the meandering storyline/character/plot/etc has been said, so I will just say this.      This writing is witty, but only witty  in a way that makes absolutely no sense when applied to a fantasy setting.  Rothfuss's main source of wit comes from plays on words that only apply to the English language.  When applied to a fantasy setting, these same witticisms make no sense at all, unless of course, the fantasy world somehow employs English as its primary language.  This flaw happens multiple times throughout both books, but due to the Second book's drastic downturn in quality, I decided to bring it up.      <<<A HOMOPHONE is a word that is pronounced the same as another word but differs in meaning. The words may be spelled the same, such as rose (flower) and rose (past tense of \\"rise\\"), or differently, such as carat, caret, and carrot, or two and too.>>>     Patrick is using plays on English words, as well as rhymes based on English pronunciations to accomplish most of his 'wit'.  If he was writing a story in a real world English speaking setting, what he said would make sense, but not come across as particularly clever.  Used in the Kingkiller setting, it makes no sense at all.     This happens so many times throughout Rothfuss's books that is isn't even worth cataloging in this post.  If you know what I am referring to, or are interested in finding it yourself, just look through the book again.  Here is a hint: Paraphrased from the text,   \\"Lackless, one of the versions of this surname, was the basis for the word \\"Lackey\\".

B001LRJH0U|4.0|There have already been enough synopsis' given concerning the movies plot, so I will focus more on the casting and authenticity from a historical perspective.    First and foremost, both Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen make an excellent pair and play off of one another very convincingly, Viggo is himself an excellent horseman, and from my eyes, really the main character in this film, although he is playing a supporting role. I see more of the movie from his eyes and dialogue than any other. Renee Zellweger was horribly cast in my opinion. It is not the character that I despise, but more her treatment of it. I think that there could have been a MUCH better choice to play the role of Allie French, as I believe Renee hurts the movie. Jeremy Irons is great in his first western role, and it a character that, while despicible, has a couple of funny moments.     Historically, (although I am not a professional historian) the film is pretty much spot on in everything from weapons, to dress, to decoration and the like for the time period. Not all westerns have paid as much attention to the most minute things that \\"Appaloosa\\" has. I dare say that MOST westerns have not. To the discerning eye, it is important. If one can believe the setting, the story tends to be more credible.     \\"Appaloosa\\" is a winner for the most part. It is a sorry shame that Hollywood doesn't take more notice of the western genre these days, and if they looked at recent western movies (Open Range, 3:10 to Yuma, Unforgiven, etc.) they would note how well they tend to do at the box office, and gives a public bored with the simple rehashing of old classic movies remade a breath of fresh air.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|The more I listen to this album the more I enjoy it.  I was not very impressed the first listen through. But it just keeps getting better and better when you re-listen to all the words she is singing and feelings she is expressing.  We have waited a long time for this album and I am not disappointed. She is expressing many things in her life that have changed her.  I agree  that she is capable of so much more.   In some live performances she blows Whitney away! Even singing Whitney's song in front of her (see You Tube) -LOL
B00000331V|3.0|Check out song selection carefully. I bought this because of the high energy of Full House. Not even close. I saw this band at the time of Full House(WOW!) Glad I was not there for these recordings. Not so bad just not close to the fire of Full House.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|the graphics have gotten better but only two levels thats not even half the game. i almost beat it to.going to delete its not worth my time
B004SBS8LA|2.0|the physics in this game make it extremely difficult to destroy the bird cages. instead of pushing some boxes they fall straight down unaffected by the bird destroying the box below it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|sold out to that stupid george lopez movie. i miss the piggies. better graphics, but still the same game.  still good however. need twenty five words. done.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|same gameplay as before, with some new polish. no issues installing and great opener to the amazon app store. first few levels are easy but it gets better as the game progresses
B004SBS8LA|5.0|wonderful revamped graphics, music.. and the same basic gameplay that grabbed us into the angry birds craze in the first place.    definitely an awesome game that you need to check out!

B0013HA838|5.0|I purchased this DVD performance of the Marriage of Figaro for a totally different reason. In the description page the language listed was English, causing me to understand that this might be SUNG IN ENGLISH. I therefore ordered it with this objective in mind, to have a performance of this Opera Buffa sung in English (very few performances in English exist, and it seems that none was captured on DVD). Any way, it turns out that the information page on Amazon describing the language as English is in error. Yes, there are subtitles in English too, but it is not sung in English. However, since it arrived I decided to check whether the exceptionally Good reviews are indeed correct. ... and what can I say but:  YES, they are more than correct. This was one of the best experiences I had in watching and listening to Opera. The cast not only that they sung and played Mozart they felt him being on stage with them. It is a miraculous performance, truly astounding. Despite the high price I strongly recommend this DVD to any Opera lover.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|awesome game.. n its free.. thats a plus.. luv the graphic.. a must download app game.. n its less than 3 mb.. u rule amazon n angry bird game designer
B002P4VUMQ|1.0|This is a great concert....... so I ordered the dvd for myself.... when I finally got around playing the whole dvd I realized halfway through it.... the dvd locks up......... and yes this is a brand new dvd player and I have no problems with any other dvd......
0670022411|5.0|I saw this book by accident when I was at Walmart. This is one of the best books/story I have read in a long time. The story is well developed and unravels perfectly through out the book. It isn't one of those books you read and 2 chapters in; you are bored. The story keeps your attention, and keeps drawing you back for more and to find out more. A++ I am thinking of getting this book as well as a gift for a well deserved friend:) Good Job!
B002FLO0MG|5.0|I don't know what the Amazon review is talking about.  I saw this movie first in the theaters when I was a little kid and have quite literally grown up watching Stargate.  This is an awesome movie that spawn equally awesome TV shows.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This version of Angry Birds is the best yet! The graphics, sounds, and visuals are all so improved! idk why you people are rating this anything less than 5 stars?!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|will not install on sprint evo tried to do it many times but still will not install dont know if its compatable or if it is something with the app
B003Q6D25U|4.0|I actually thought this one was better than Paranormal Activity 1. I liked how this one gave way more background on the back story of the series and how it was able to connect both movies together. That was really neat.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|Surprisingly, this is my first Michael Lewis book. It defnitiely won't be my last. Why I haven't read Moneyball yet is beyond me...<br /><br />I won't pretend to know the ins-and-outs of the finance world, or could even really explain what CDOs and CDSs are, even after reading the book. Despite this, I found the book fascinating - a real page turner, which surprised me considering the subject matter.<br /><br />The characters are all fascinating, the story griping, and the ending stomach turning.<br /><br />The frustrating part is the whole time I was reading this, the thought went through my head, \\"Why didn't I see this coming?\\" Evidently, I was far from the only one. The book expanded my view on who was ultimately responsible for this mess well beyond my initial impressions.<br /><br />I'm sure there are other books that better explain the crash of the financial system, but I truly enjoyed reading this one.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Download was relatively easy. Works well on Droid X. Graphics are significantly better than the original Angry Birds. I've only played a few boards, but it's fun so far.
B004SCI9BS|4.0|So throw out tracks 4 and 7 and what's left is a solid Strokes album featuring songs rating from average to very good.  The opening 2 tracks are probably the best, but it closes on a strong note with track 10.  Can't say I'm not slightly disappointed after the long wait but at least it's some more Strokes and mostly decent stuff.  They can't all be masterpieces, right?
