B0007VF9Z8|5|I got this bumper and the appropriate mounting kit, spent 30 minutes under the tail end of my 87 Ram getting everything perfect.  The mounting bracket has about a dozen different ways to mount it, so attach everything loosely and adjust for pitch and depth before cranking it down.  So far it has held up well, I have mounted a ball to it and pulled a light duty trailer with a generator on it without issue.  The bumper itself has black silicone around the top where the diamond pattern plate meets the vertical bumper, doesn't last long but easy to replace or just lay a weld on it yourself.  Great deal, great value, I recommend for your old truck.
B0097GSD5W|5|The starter fit and worked great, also arrived on time !!!
B000O0JQSS|5|snapped in perfect
B00G8WLT7C|5|Rugged and well built especially for use in outdoor situations like boats or camping.
B005UQQARG|5|Here's the deal, if your looking for mats that will perfectly fit your car, these aren't it. Although they are great mats. Thick durable and have some depth to collect mud and grime. Also they don't slide around.  Great basic floor mat.
B001DBVPY0|4|Easy install. Performs well. Good price. No mpg increase.kinda loud
B00N22TXEC|4|Fit great but did not like the cheap clamps
B000CMH3K6|5|worked perfect put the wheel where I nedded it.
B00005OWK2|5|Great!!
B0013FXXGE|5|OEM part and it worked perfectly.
B00UO2D6BO|5|WORKED FLAWLESSLY WITH THE NX409
B0013FMW84|5|great $$
B004W973W8|5|They fit great and give my car a good custom look, granite my father tried to put in a light and cracked the lense telling me i have to pay attention when he wasent, but they look great, worth every penny, now if only the headlights werent so high in price
B00PBO0Z3M|5|fit and great $$
B00F3J2FW4|5|These slush mats fit perfectly and look great on my 2015 JKU Sport.  I would highly recommend these for anyone with pets or that tend to get their fabric mats dirty all of the time.  In addition, these were delivered to me much faster than expected.
B00T1LRTNU|4|It was ok I had to do some prep work that made it look great once painted but if your going to leave it black unpainted I wouldn't recommend
B00VR6ZX1W|5|Good quality. As described.
B0030Q24RI|1|doesn't hold the shine not the product i thought it would be ,bought the tire shine jel and it is the best product#836610-6 and it's great!!!
B0039HBPQ4|5|Works great
B003RVT35W|5|Was easy to install and I love it.
B009S7I96I|5|Worked just fine, cleaned off what was left of my old one, applied sealant, and screwed the skylight down. No leaks!
B002R38TCE|3|leaves loose brush hairs on my top
B004MTGE5A|5|Perfect fit.
B00P2RIZTY|5|Fit perfect for my Toyota Yaris 2007 Sedan.  Allowed me with the Scochee Dash Kit to professionally fit my Alpine radio in replacement of the OEM Toyota radio which is a 2 DIN and part of the panel.  This was a perfect replacement.
B00AFVCOIU|5|fit my 2014 chevy malibu perfectly
B00KL3ALGO|4|Stick to the car well.  No complaints
B00BYH6C1E|5|Well the only downside to this product is its made me realize that I was so used to dropping stuff down in between the seat and the cup holder!!  Haha.  I was used to sticking papers there, dropping fries, etc... I don't know whats down there now but it's hidden by this product.  Absolutely love it and it works well!  I have a 2009 Jeep Liberty just in case anyone wants to know if it fits their car.
B0055PD1H4|5|A great product it helped to renew my discolored vinyl top.
B003IS3HV0|2|my expectations were too high
B0002F66G0|5|It is good for my pop up camper all I did bought starcraft decals stick it and it looks like original OEM.
B000I2YSY4|5|Perfect fit, nice look, high quality. Tried a racequip before and it was pressing my head. Returned it, spent a bit more to get this Shoei and I do not regret. It is both DOT and SNELL which allows me to do auto-x. Highly recommended!!
B003N9MQCK|3|One of the lids no longer stays snug.  Glad a purchased two!  I like a lot of coffee at times and 34oz allows me to stay focused on whatever I'm doing at the time.
B0050Z9QBY|5|Have been running this kit for about 2 months now, 5000K H1 bulbs. This looks to be as close to a true 5000k as I have seen from cheaper aftermarket solutions, replaced an older aftermarket 6000K kit and this one is observably brighter and much closer to pure white. Install was easy, the kit is of a decent quality and provides great value. The fancy box it is shipped in is much flimsier when you receive your item, but that doesn't really matter to me at all as I purchased this to do an install for lighting, not to look at the box.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Bought these for a 2002 Ford Explorer I just got off Craigslist. Setup was simple: turn ignition from off to on 8 times, leaving it on the eighth time. Press the lock button on each clicker, turn vehicle off. Done.  Worked the first try for me.<br /><br />I do wish the keychain holes were bigger. It's a pretty stiff fit on my keyring.
B008L5J5G6|5|Recived today . Real metal tailgate handle.
B003TTL0TE|5|I had been using a micro-fiber towel to wash the car, but should have bought this one before. First time I was really able to wash my car and end up with it clean (no spot left behind) :)
B0067ES9M4|5|Easy install and just enough lift, I like it
B0002V9IFU|5|great price and works super
B00F4MQJ5O|4|Very bright, but make sure to put it on properly....my brother's ended up coming loose and fell off....didn't damage it though.
B001TO1D48|5|It works.
B00VB2OJLW|2|I purchased the one to fix my Chrysler 300 but it's really short
B003BZQ7IU|5|i love it...as expected
B0061XTCPY|5|very strong
B00O72R7Z8|3|If the relay gets wet, it will rust and then stop functioning. I wrapped it up in electrical tape and have had no issues since.
B007VR66CQ|5|I used this in conjunction with the relays sold here on Amazon to control my custom electric fan setup. Easy to install and it works perfectly.
B0030DKDY2|5|Excellent working well
B009DJSJEI|5|fits great
B005XK04MQ|5|Second order for other umbrella's.  It works
B00OTLE1HY|2|One broken plate.
B007KCZPOM|4|As expected product ... Fit very well to my s-10 pick up chevrolet....
B003BZLBEK|5|Bolted up perfectly to my 440. Best to keep the bolts lose until mounted to the engine,  then tighten them.
B0017KJ0EO|4|Looks nice. Initially sliding the hitch pin through my class III receiver and the shackle hitch pin hole required a hammer. After hammering it in and working it back and forth it slides freely enough to insert without a hammer.
B004OK77L2|5|Have used this on one trip since installation. Installation took about an hour and was easy if you mechanically inclined and have a few tools. It is a little noisy to operate, however not as noisy as some other brands that I've seen while camping. It does what I expected to do for the money.
B004X973EA|5|Worked very well in my Harley.  Now I can find neutral with the engine running ...
B005JV91AA|4|Used it as directed. No more clogged tubes.
B009IF2LEQ|5|Easy to install. Worked perfectly.
B00R4JT5MO|4|good looking bolts
B007OXCIB0|5|No problems here. Matches existing carbon fiber on car. Happy customer.
B00AZA9XQ2|5|Quality USA cutters
B000M8R0QM|4|I've used it a couple of times and it worked great. Much easier than trying to find a gas station for air.
B002MYG8L2|4|it fit well and  looks nice two years later money well spent   i did reuse license plate lights   seems to be high quality
B0097EKD16|5|Carpets fit perfectly in 2004 STi. Seem to be of high quality. No complaints.
B0048ECN1S|5|Fit my 2000 Odyssey Van perfectly.
B00K34OKKE|5|Fits perfect on my r6 just a lil but to loud lol but overall I like it thanks
B00CC12NOG|5|My husband spilt his coffee all over my drivers seat because he had it in his lap. Apparently he forgot cars have cup holders. It was a good thing I had these put in.
B01092ICIA|4|It is great, it stays in place very well unlike other car seat covers I used in the passed. I bought it for my 2013 jeep compass, it fits for the most part, I kind of had to maneuver the back because its a little different but it all worked out.
B001TGH9OE|5|Easy on and off<br /><br />Excellent shine and reflection
B001T9FZKQ|5|OEM fit on my 04 kia rio. really easy to install, took me no time .
B010D07MWK|5|Exactly as advertised. The product was fully sealed and performs wonderfully in my 2006 Duramax.
B00BFE31ZQ|5|The part came on time, it was exactly what I needed to solve the problem I've been having for years!!  Saved me from having to pay the garage their high labor labor charges me and fix a problem that they couldn't even figure out to begin with!
B00NH49NL8|3|I am a little disappointed by the product. There are some scratches in the back, but not obvious.
B00MG687JW|4|The Nekteck Jump Starter is a well packaged unit with all the adapters one could need.  It jump started a tractor easily to date.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of the poorly written instructions from China.  I do not know who teaches them English.  Somebody working for Nekteck in the USA could (and should) provide some value-added by improving upon the poor instructions provided by the Chinese.
B00O8W66VS|1|A bulb adaptor is needed to be installed and the terminals need modifications to connect to 12V. Too much is required in order for this to work.
B004D5L9NU|4|I found it very easy to get my mobile one oil filters worth my Amazon prime free shipping also in two days.
B000B8GAT6|5|Fit perfect and does what a radiator cap is supposed to do.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Good set of cables !!!
B00C6RDCUU|5|Solid product for the price. I recommend pulling out the fog lights and using a heat gun during installation to remove bubbles. The material is strong and flexible, but avoid using sharps on it for any reason.
B0083G3AXC|5|Love my zero gravity chair and love that this little table means I can stay reclined and relaxed with my book, my phone and a drink right at my fingertips. Easy to snap on the chair, and can hold plenty - and it's easy to clean.
B0043IX1ZG|5|Worked great on the upper clips of the side skirts of my '06 Chevy Malibu Maxx.
B0067UCCDU|5|pretty good!
B000COMX3Q|5|Fit perfectly on the wrangler and love the fact that there is a 5th one for the spare tire.
B006G5AY3G|5|as advertised--Well packaged --Very quick shipment! Thanks
B00JVWDWPS|3|I previous had a spiderweb on my 2013 JK, bought a 2015 JKU and went with the Alien shade.  I am disappointed overall.  The grommet holes are not placed well.  There are two in the front unevenly spaced to connect to the center latch, do you connected to bungee cords or one and have it at an angle?  There are grommet holes for hard top located in the middle of the shade, they have no way of being secured and at freeway speeds flap and make a very loud clank against the metal, very annoying.  The length is a bit short or too long overall as well.  The last grommet holes are placed at the widest meatiest part of the part of the roll cage and bungee cords have to be stretched to their absolute limit to tie down the net.  Could have added 1.5 inches and not had that problem.  Edit:After reviewing the pictures for the Spiderwebshade I see they have the same design with two grommets in the middle.  I stopped by Home Depot on the way to work after going nuts on the freeway from what sounded like rocks hitting the jeep over and over and over again... I put together a screw and rubber washer system to secure those grommets to the hard top screw holes.  Problem solved.  Wished the solution had come with the shade and didn't require me making it up.
B000CISLSI|5|These have done exactly what we needed them to do!
B00U7FA35A|3|Looked ok, thought they would be error free in my e39 Touring, but no such luck. They fit in an 1156 mount, they would be a good choice for someone without iBus, or possibly CanBus. Not useful for my application so I returned them.
B00HG1LHQW|5|This stuff really works. I was having mileage issues in my LBZ and this helped me pick up 2mpg. It also greatly helped my balance rates.
B00M80BRYI|5|Nicer than i thought it would be....vinal is thick and nice quality.  Went on in 5 minutes.
B000KK90U6|5|I'm using this as a replacement for the kill switch on a 1958 Fastwin outboard motor and it looks and works perfectly. I actually enjoy it much more than the original push-button design since it takes just a lift of the two fingers on one hand to pull out and know the engine will turn off almost immediately with one quick pull instead of holding a button with your thumb.<br /><br />I also love that it seems very well sealed.
B001KQE9Q4|5|Just as described.  Fits my 09 DCLB perfectly.<br /><br />Just be aware it's not a Toyota OEM part but a repro.  Either way matches 100%.
B008V3UFNA|5|Thx
B000BGHYDO|4|Good job
B00O6WPVXY|5|New filter design filters to smaller micron. Works very well and fits perfectly. 2006 LBZ
B004BTC2XY|5|Good heavy duty switch.  All metal construction, no plastic.
B00EDFM7DQ|5|led version of the RV interior lights work great.
B007X48RV0|1|Eyelashes seem to be of a really good material! Arrived in a timely fashion! However.... Only lasted about 2 days before the adhesive started to turn loose... Sad about that! Bc I seriously believe this product has super potential!
B000BRJVUW|4|Great switch fast install
B00ELR3XM0|5|These worked great. No problem at all.
B000KL72DC|5|Great fit on my 07 F150 crew cab bought the set lil pricy but worth it....
B00KRQFSVI|1|Ok for what it was. Needed something about 12-18 inches long.
B00FADJ06C|1|This very clearly will not fit a 2009-2012 VW Tiguan, despite what the description may say and despite Amazon filtering by car make, model, and year. Furthermore, it does not look like a factory replacement, as the part is not the same color and has a bunch of junk text on it.
B000IMHW9M|5|Superb design and easy to use. Can use one handed in tight locations and never worry about shorting against other wires.
B002QALLOQ|5|very nicely made. Durable.
B00ZE5RGTY|5|This bundle is a great price for what you are getting!  I was in the market to buy the the car seat catchers because I was sick and tired of things like change, buts of paper, my phone, pens, falling between the seats.  For the same price the seat catchers would cost at the store, I got those AND the non-slip mat/phone mount.  They both come in very handy.  The sticker I gave to my sister, who just had a baby a week ago...they thought it was cute. :)<br /><br />I did receive this bundle at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.  That in no way influenced my opinion.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Love it!
B000EQTSOO|5|Installed on a 2006 Silverado 6.0L. Solved the codes I was getting which related to a bad gas pedal. Turns out it was the throttle body.
B00SFZDQ6C|5|Good quality decal. Looks great on a tinted window!
B00R3LYF7S|5|Nice deep trunk organizer that works well in the back of an SUV. It keeps items secure and grocery bags upright. The sides are firm and the floor has inserts to add stability.
B00SYX6JM8|3|It's ok not too small not too big but the colors are darker than the picture and you can't read the words around symbol in the middle but in all I like it
B00KULAV8K|5|great
B000BQW5LK|5|Got the job done for pumping rear diff fluid up and into the differential. Don't forget to insert the straw part into the pump before using.
B004304C0W|4|Was a gift and daughter liked it a lot!
B00SI6O07M|3|Make sure when they say it fit your car it does. The front one fit fine but the back one is to big and does not fit correct
B0027Z6CY4|3|The chain is fine and perfect for what I need, but I was disappointed that it comes already pre-rusted.  It was either used and returned after a while, or they store these things in a flooded warehouse, but a new chain should not be all rusted up like this.  But after all, it is a chain. Even if it arrived all squeaky clean, I'm sure it would be rusty after a couple of uses. Not worth the hassle sending it back. It aint pretty, but it works.
B0076QWMNO|5|Good deal easy to install.
B008FYKV4I|2|It fell off!! junk.
B001F15VT8|5|Top notch product!  Works great for Motorcycle Air ride!
B0091U220G|1|Was Bent when I got it... Doesn't match up my brand new icon helmet no it has a whistle and air noise when going over 40mph
B006HGA8EO|1|This top was horrible spend the extra and buy a quality top. Zipper broke while installing it. Started raining and it's already leaking the first day. Very dissatisfied in this top.
B00O99UR5G|5|The magnet design is perfect.  Works so well to take up and down without that far reach to get a tag around the back of the morrow
B00N2E395O|1|The screws don't fit the holes of a Mercedes Benz kind of defeats the purpose...
B00IIOJEJS|5|Nice jacket and fits my wife very well.
B00N58KQMQ|5|This was fabulous as an option to changing the locks in our new RV.  It helps that you don't need to have keys always at the ready and kids/friends can have combo to access RV too. Pricey, but worth it!
B001FIDNGO|5|little pricey but works great
B00LYFC0US|5|-1997 Honda Civic Hatch Back- DX going through Type R conversion. Before I purchased this shifter I looked at a lot of companies - b&m, skunk, all of em, this is the best deal, most legit shifter, I purchased the vms shifter that came with vms type r shifter. #1 its crafted with aircraft quality aluminum and is a sold piece, the shaft isn't welded to shift ball. its one piece.- quality ball bearings at the bottom  on both sides.. #2 shift knob is amazing quality with 5 gears and R , screws on to shifter and has a locking nut you can say thats rounded off and is also vms- the shift knob and this create a cross lock against each other and its a sold lock - knob aint moving if u tighten em right.  very pleased and even happier you guys are florida based !!!! can't wait to order more parts!
B003Z55XKO|5|great
B0012ILZAS|5|WHAT???? I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!!!!  great horns, replaced Se Ray stock horns with these....
B00BD4SM9S|5|very good
B000BGK22E|5|I didn't love installing it, but it works just fine. Installation was easy if you can crawl under your RV. Drain your tanks before removing the valve.
B00Y4NQD1O|5|So easy to install, looks 200% better than stock one.
B001PYO0BA|5|The master cylinder worked perfect !!!!
B00EWSE5HA|5|Very satisfied with this item. Easy install and a huge savings on this item.
B00266Z8LW|5|I was not happy with the bulbs. Cheap quality and 1 was already broken when I got them. Any products like this need to be packaged much better.
B00OQPRPK8|5|I bought this to use on the bus trips our local AARP takes.  I have not used it yet but it looks like it's going to be perfect.  It's not really big so it won't be in the way when we need to get out of our seats.  There's a place for our drinks and lots of pockets for things like our phone or IPad.  We can keep a pen and some granola bars in the handy pockets.  I'm sure once we take our next trip I'll be able to tell you even more about it.
B00W4XNQ16|5|Product arrived in a timely manner, undamaged in a package properly designed for size, protection, and ease of opening.<br />These Mehr red and black  key chains are sturdy and nice . It's simple to use and so convenient to use ! The rings to slide your keys are strong .<br />Product is as advertised and does what is advertised.<br />I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
B0041G1E7M|5|If you're looking for a sweet upgrade to your favorite true, these are the thing... I've got a 2014 Tacoma 4x4.  I wanted something that wouldn't get in the way, looked cool and i didn't bash my shins on every time i get into or out of my truck.  I had the OEM toyota steps on the truck, they looked great, but they weren't functional - not sure exactly way, but i think it was the placement of the step, it was too high.  So, i decided to dive into the big time and go for the AMP steps.  I got them in a couple of days here on amazon.  Install is much longer than the simply side steps.  I took my time and spend about 2.5 hours putting them in.  They drop down low enough to make getting into the truck easy, they look awesome, my kids can use them easily, all-in-all, they are the best upgrade to my truck i've done...
B001C9BYGW|5|The Coolant hose was everything I expected. Amazon saved me quite a bit of money. Thank You
B009B9IHSI|4|A slightly better fit than the sun screen I got from the BMW dealer.  ...very happy with this item, over-all.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|For the size of the bar I was amazed at the amount of light it could push out, had it installed before I got my hids and even after. Perfect little light bar.
B00NFSOSJS|2|Way too large! Perhaps they should have women sizes with a smaller quad
B00UM9X2HW|4|Works well but I don't like the fittings they use and the line it comes with. Does what it's supposed to do though, read boost and vacuum.
B00FLG0AQM|5|Good! Works great on my 2003 Jetta GLS. Hopefully this will solve my p0351 code.
B004AQZUX2|1|Very disappointed.  They wouldn't fire. A Waste of money.
B00SFYXJOW|5|Great key cover, bought it after I lose the screw to the back cover of my key. It gathers dust pretty quickly, but can easily be cleaned with a wet napkin. It doesn't add too much bulk to the key, but it definitely feels protected. Wasn't too much of a hassle to put on (though I wouldn't recommend removing and replacing it constantly).  For its price it's an excellent product and a great way to protect your key that would otherwise cost $100+ to replace
B00K3B5966|4|The drain washers are very nicely made of aluminum which will crush and keep the oil in.  But the shipping took over two weeks to get here, much too long for a simple envelop mailer.
B00J0IKPIU|5|100% recommend if your JK Wrangler if your looking for a remote start! Installed today on my 2010 JKU Wrangler, got a little confused on the instructions, called the number provided  (which goes straight to the guys cell phone) super nice and helpful, and he walked me though the entire install. Literally took 5 minutes from opening the box to remote starting my Jeep. The hardest part is figuring out how to tie wrap nice and neat under the dash!
B001KQD7YE|5|While did not look like actuator it was replacing, it fit perfectly. Incidentally, online this is what all sites showed as replacement actuator for 2002 Ford Ranger. None looked like actuator being replaced.
B00KJWW7GO|5|Installed in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 190,000 miles.  Cup holder functioning properly.
B000BQKEEU|5|been running gates for years, they never disappoint . these cost less them my local store.
B001CDB242|5|Excellent
B00LUS3WCE|3|Fits Toyota 90915-YZZD1 AND D3 filters. This definitely has a more solid construction and has less flexible walls than your standard cap oil filter wrenches available from Imperial- OEM(in this case does not mean Original Equipment Manufacturer)- Cal Van- Performance Tool- Lisle- GearWrench- Steelman- AMPRO- OTC- BikeMaster- CTA- KD. **I don't know about the CTA HD (Heavy Duty) and NAPA Ultra Pro(KD) that have the nuts welded on. They could still be a flexible thin wall design with a nut welded on.**  It fits snugly. Once the filter is off of the engine I always have to use force to separate the tool from the filter.  This tool makes good use of the flutes/flats in the filter but it still doesn't fit all the way down on the filter. I would have liked to be able to push the tool another 2 mm/ about .078 inch/ or 5/64 inch further onto the filter. Even with that it's better than a lot out there given it's rigidity. The quality of the materials seems ok. The tool that was sent to me looks like it is new but had been treated a bit roughly with several scratches in the finish. It was possibly dropped or slammed against other things. The finish scratches rather easily. As a example I used Super Fine 0000 steel wool to try and clean it up a bit and I noticed it scratching the finish so I immediately stopped. Looks aren't exactly what you purchase a filter wrench for but more of a general observation.
B00JIEX722|5|Really bright LED's. Ordered them for my Harley to light up the plate, and I was very happy at how much light these give off. Will buy more for my truck.
B008B5XAQ2|5|Replaces ta-34 sealant for ford tire mobility kit. Mine expires 2019. I recently used this to plug a large nail hole and it worked. It got me 50 miles home and to the shop the next day. Includes canister and hose.
B00QRCQNU6|3|It's very cool but it turns sideways when driving over 40 mph. It makes my antenna swing back and forth and it's very distracting.
B003LMGDHI|3|does a great job removing swirls and light scratches with DA.  Working time is minimal and creates too much dust.  Newer products on the market do just as good a job with the dusting and mess.
B00C3NWORO|5|Perfect. fits tight and works well.
B00MC7H3LS|5|Great bulbs, bright enough to use as tail lights. I use them on a 2012 Honda accord and it gives off a unique look, with the reflectors inside (since there are multiple light sources on the bulbs). I would not recommend using these during the day though, the light is a bit concentrated and is harder to notice.
B00EOZBN8A|5|Great product and service.  Thanks
B0036E9VB6|5|I bought this for my sister's car. Funny thing though, it was my friend's car that need the air. It was fast. Plug to the cig port and start. It was so easy. Planning to buy one more in the future.
B00SUU0XKY|1|Two out of four fell apart. Not a quality product
B001PWA0IO|5|Love it enough to buy a third one after the second one broke. The ball on tailgate end sheared off. If it happens again will drop the rateing
B00IZ247ZO|5|Makes your vehicle shine!!!!
B000BTK8WA|5|install was simple took about 1 hr. (I'm a mechanic) very impressed with how it's holding up towing 3500 with trailer only 8 psi in bag's. cant even tell the truck only dropped half inch. with suv full of people 99 pathfinder.
B000C9ULLC|5|Installed filter on original 01M transmission in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 142,000 miles in July 2011.  Now in August 2015 Vehicle has 190,000 miles.  Original transmission functioning properly.
B00MGV00EM|5|Very nice. Except for the 3m tape doesn't stick so I had to add more 3m tape to it. Now it's all we are and very nice fit.
B00E9BEDA4|5|I love it it was easy to install and perfect for my mustang
B00028FB8G|5|used many times no issues
B000H8U37K|5|perfect fit !!!!
B000CF1Y7G|5|Perfect replacement part.....saved many $$$
B00M26P5S2|5|These worked for me although I did have to pull the wire contacts over a half-millimeter on one bulb to make it work. Hope that they will last a long time.
B00DNV2JJS|1|Dear readers, Never buy this product for Honda Accord, it will not work. I experienced severe vibration for the car after fitting these mountings and all these mountings broke with in 3 months. I had to go back to Honda workshop to refix the car with genuine honda mountings.
B0012TRKGA|3|Got these for my R6 a while back. Not a bad buy but there are better ones out there for sure.
B00279JGV6|3|I ordered these because the description said they came with hardware included,  I received them and there was no hardware in the (not even sealed) Monroe box.  Also the pads themselves look like they've been sitting on a shelf for years.  They're not bad and for the price I didn't expect much more than just a product that works, but a complete set with pins and levers as stated would have been nice.
B002E2ZUNE|5|These are some nice pure yellow bulbs. I use them as DRLs. I wanted a unique look without loss of high beams, so I turned to these. If you're looking for distance in your high beams don't get these, these bulbs are more for just purse aesthetics, the high beams are bright and having a different color high beam is nice for flashing. These bulbs also help in the fog.
B00K0MK7Y2|5|Great product from aFe as all their products are and, as always, was easy to install and had me up and roaring in no time! Works great and has my little Passat sounding great!
B000W0RQ8C|5|Solid
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works exactly as advertised. Doesn't feel like it could tear or break easily. The strap attached to it really comes in handy. The sleeve/pouch thing isn't of much use. Kinda hard to get the folded sunscreen into the pouch, so I just don't use it.  The sticky pad that came with it is rather awesome. I love using it.
B009D3LTQE|3|No use, doesn't work. But they refunded my money after an email request therefore 3 stars.
B00R9UV8HS|4|Does what it says.
B00WTJ5C44|5|I installed 1 GP bulb and one brand new OEM bulb to compare brightness and color at night pointing the beam to my garage.  I have to say the GP is brighter and the color is white with a little blue. The OEM bulb is yellowish. These bulbs have been installed in the vehicle now for 2 months and they seem to be holding up but only time will tell.  I recommend these because Ives tried some other off brands and the bulbs usually last about 4 days.
B00KKEKWDQ|1|I have purchased several led lights in the passed and have been pleased with most of them, they were bright easy to install and fairly cheap. This product on the other hand is a pain to get the brackets to fit just right due to the heavy powered coat. Not only the assembly aspect of it but after the 10min struggle of installing the mounts once mounted and darkness falls the light will continue to disappoint you, I compared the lights to some that I already had installed on my vehicle and they were far from the same. Dull widely flooded light that I'm sure is not the desire for most. If you are like me when I turn my lights on I want everyone to say, ouch that's bright as their retinas singe under the massive wave of energy being produced. Further more if what you are seeing a light as bright as the sun, keep searching my friend it is out there but just not right here.
B00E1L72RS|3|They weren't as effective as I had hoped they'd be and a bit too small but they're not too bad.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great and innovative product. Have now been using it for over a month. Very pleased how it stays on the windshield and protects interior from sun. Major upgrade from a vinyl sun protector.
B00LZLR6XW|3|So beautiful! The colors are vivid and its very cute. Sad thing is that the flower part began to peel after about 6 months of having it on.
B0009YDQE4|5|Great product ,it is as described thank you
B0046DQTQQ|3|Loojs super sharp on my truck but the only problem is that the cap part that goes over screw head doesnt fit or stay on!!
B008LX7FXS|3|WE NEVER INSTALLED DIDNT NEED IT
B00FS946OO|5|perfect, thank you
B0040CTUN2|5|Great kit I work on a lot of cars missing clips.
B005UTS6FC|5|Looks super  cute on my black dodge ram truck!!!works great in all types of rain!!
B0051AOCOO|5|Love this vest. Adorable & very sexy!
B00A82A3RK|1|It is not good.first day its work good .i charged again but it not working like the first day
B00YI3IGA6|5|This is an awesome product! I haven't had a chance to have my windows tinted yet and my grandchildren were baking in the back seat when we went on long car rides. I was looking for something temporary but now I'm not in a big hurry to get those windows tinted. Don't hesitate to buy these!
B00B7GHIGA|4|Package arrived torn up pretty badly.  Hardware was loose inside torn box, however I can sympathize with the difficulty in securing such a heavy sharp item in cardboard.<br />Ramp and rack seems very sturdy.  I like that the bar is steel and the ramp/ rack aluminum.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some of the worst instructions I have seen!.  IE  &#34;insert long bolt in proper place&#34;  where does that long bolt go and what is it for?  in the instructions it states that its to secure the ramp.  I dont see how and I dont see how the ramp can go on either side of the rack.  Also, the instructions dont tell /show which way the rack is mounted on the hitch bar, but I assume that the triangular aluminum brackets that span the rack are intended to have the open side up, not the pointed side up?  and the open space is for the front tire?<br /><br />  I wish that the ramp could be used on either end of the rack also (to load the bike then unload it off the opposite side)  instead there is only one bar from which to hang the ramp from.  easy to drive the bike  up, hard to back it off.  would be easier to drive it off.<br /><br />  KAGE!  PLEASE TELL ME WHY THE INSTRUCTIONS SAY TO LINE UP THE ANTI-SWAY BRACKET WITH THE FLAT SIDE AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE-  BUT THE PICTURE SHOWS THE OPPOSITE! ? !  please help me understand if I am mistaken so I can correct this review and make it 5 stars.
B002FVPS22|1|Starter came on time and fit on my boat fine but after 15 times starter burn up. do not waste your money and time. They just send me email blame problem with my engine as soon as I took old starter out and install new my engine  started right up.For 1 year warranty they can blame on anything so be very careful what you buy from this company
B000EDUTQ8|5|Perfect replacement for my RV waste water valve.
B00WOT3YM6|4|Worth it.
B005CLN9AK|1|Bad fit
B003UT3S6Q|5|This stuff works wonders on my wheels, but I really find that simple car soap or dish soap works just as well on painted wheels. Your mileage may vary. The purple foaming action sure looks cool, so I assume it's doing something magical while cleaning the wheels.
B0098C5VHI|4|Good
B00UZ0OHIQ|4|I would like it to give information while I'm driving and more incite into the workings of the car. Those things aside, the device works as expected.
B008I2OZK8|5|This visually help the look of my front end.  Lessened the white chipped paint marks. Now I can postpone that paint job another season.  Good product.
B00496LM4E|4|good fit and does the job well as intended
B00SUTHIVM|5|This fit perfectly in the back of my SUV behind the 3rd row seats.  Keeps groceries, especially milk jugs from sliding around and falling out when I open the hatch.  Very sturdy and also will fold if not in use. I bought 2 and they fit perfect across the entire SUV.
B00HDMEUCW|4|I love this- the only complaint I have is I wish the straps adjusted shorter.  Also- it seems like white would get dirty- a self-colored &#34;neck&#34; would have been prettier.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|Fit my 2008 yaris with no issues
B0054YCW62|4|for my brother's side-by-side.
B00G6FDT7E|5|exact fit work great
B003SS62PS|4|Moves a lot of air. Easy to adjust the oscillating direction. The spring clamp has a strong spring and gets a very good grip on cabin shelves or bulkhead framing on the sailboat. The ends of the clip are plastic/soft so there hasn't been any damage to the teak.  We've used it in the V berth to help keep our grandson cooler so he can nap while we are sailing.  It does that well. My only complaint: This fan has only one speed.  Fast... and fast translates to noisy.
B00WNQGYHC|5|Pretty amazing lights.  I ordered these for the fog lamps in our 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  We have HiD lights in the headlights and have been trying to find something to match for about a year.  I came across these lights about 3 weeks ago and after doing some research, decided to buy.  I received them earlier this week and installed in about 5 minutes.  Took a night-time drive and let me tell you, they are awesome.  They might be brighter than the HiD kit we have installed.  Honestly I'm not sure why I'd ever buy HiD again.<br />I would absolutely recommend these for a headlight or fog lamp application.
B0002STSV2|5|Definitely what I've been wanting to get for awhile to get more organized with all the tools in the garage. Curious as to how well the magnet holds the sockets in. Bought the red ones for better visibility as opposed to the black colored ones. I do wish there were more colors to choose from.
B0027XEKQ8|2|This vent is identical to the one on my camper that warped and leaked.  Probably the same manufacturer.  When I opened the package I found the vent was wrapped around the dome seals with cellophane and the seals were permanently deformed.  Now when the dome is closed it doesn't seal well.  This allows the vent to leak when the rain splashes under the dome lip.  I wish now I had returned it.
B00E3ZAY0O|5|Excellent as extra lights at night.  Could be brighter for daytime but these are extra mounted on my trunk.  Using as running light and brake light.
B00XAX4B9A|3|It does block the sun, which is nice.  But it's so slippery that it falls down all of the time.  I have tried to even tuck the corners up underneath the visors and it still slips down.
B00W92PGOM|5|WOW ..WORK 100% ON  LEXUS ES350 2009 BASE SAUDI SPACE
B004VKR652|4|Exact for and easy shipping.
B0051T46G4|5|exactly as described, fast shipping, thx
B004809YBE|5|Good quality
B00T4IL9J0|5|Got them a day sooner then what in was told installed them that night and they look awesome on my 2002 f250 superduty 7.3 diesel
B00AN2L0TU|5|Very nice and very easy to install directions were very easy to follow.
B0031LPQLS|5|These arrived quickly. They are as fantastic. Very easy to attache to grill.  Look so good I've had strangers say how great they look.  If your thinking of these, they will completely improve the looks of your trucks front end.<br /> Have been thru several car washes. Stay in place totally.  Michael
B00EUUNJRM|3|It fit right try to find mount or roof rack rail for toyota SUV .
B00KTIUG5C|1|No matter what I do, I can't seem to program these. I've replaced batteries and I've tried several times. I got one to program but that was short lived it didn't work the next day.  I've programmed wireless remotes in the past but  this one doesn't seem to want to work.
B00KTHSYXO|5|great product, fit my 2003 dodge truck old key remote's perfect.
B0024GQJ2G|5|My wife loves it
B00FAMAFXK|5|Works great so far.  Very simple swap out.  The original was 9 yrs old.
B00G5UXQ8W|1|Well I have a 96 toyota tacoma 60/40 split bench that looks exactly like the picture shown. There was not a 96 seat cover(s) listed by amazon. I punched in this item and the &#34;Does not fit your vehicle&#34; note did not pop-up so I took a chance and ordered them any way. I installed them and noticed they did not fit right. They were kinda close and I did not want to go through the return/exchange process and I really needed some seat covers so I kept them. I really think the picture is of a 96 tacoma and not 90-95 models.
B00TKON8IS|5|Worked for my 1992 Honda Prelude that me and my son are building together. Seems like it is pretty well built,
B0058SQWGU|5|Easy to install and works great.
B0058SQXZK|5|Operates smoothly
B00P1MLR9K|5|I love my license plate frame-saying just what needs to be said.  God has bless America-but we have turned aside from that.  It is time<br />for &#34;America, Bless God!&#34;  My daughter had me order one for her right away!
B005BNP7Z4|5|Amazing product
B00WT7I63U|3|Works as you would expect. Try using silicone gaskets instead- leak proof and you never have to replace them.
B000BYB1QM|5|Excellent value.
B008CIQG9Q|5|I bought these for my husbands 2012 Toyota Tacoma they are wonderful and a perfect fit on front driver and passenger  side they lock into place. The one in the back does not fasten down so hopefully we won't have any problems, they seem to fit very well and am so pleased I ordered them for him it was a pleasant surprise. He wanted them but does not spending extra money on his self ( so I have to do it for him )
B00SOKVPAC|4|Grips are nice, but smell like plastic. Had trouble getting the clamp for the throttle around the bars on my pitbike, and it doesn't sit all the way flush together. Still works as it should though.
B00DX8BTUG|5|I've used this in my motorcycle tires for years now to help protect against a tire going down on me while I'm out riding, but it does a good job of keeping the tire balanced through out the life of the tire.  I add the recommended 25% more (2oz.) than required to eliminate the need to balance the tire.  I also use Ride-On in my car tires but it is a different blend as well as a larger bottle.  I will continue to use this product in the future.
B003EOZLEO|5|I have a brand new 2015 jeep sport and installed perfectly.  Only took 15 minutes.  It off been easier and looks awesome too.
B0013REXSO|5|these are a great addition...both for climbing in/out and for off-roading.
B00Z89I2OY|5|Exactly what we were looking for! The handles are very sturdy, great for something to hold on to while we bounce around on the trails. Easy to move depending on our needs. We love them!
B00NBT4774|5|I recommend the seller and the product! :)
B00HR5RYNW|5|This was indeed an original OEM part.  Just like you would expect.  Works like it should.
B00EXV2UBO|5|bad ass
B004L7I70I|3|The fitment in our 2013 Odyssey just doesn't appear correct. It doesn't want to stay in one spot. From the pictures it looks more rubberized. The actual material is more plastic like. It still serves its purpose but it isn't what I consider an optimal floor covering. I'm also unsure how this is folding. After looking at it in the van with the seats down I'm not sure what the real advantage is supposed to be. I guess it makes it easier to store in the cargo area after you raise the back seats.
B000UVCK9S|5|Super easy to install, I have bought them in the passed and installed them inside my Cobalt when I still had it and now I bought another set and have them in my 2005 Chevy Trailblazer, so to me this products worth every penny!
B002ZTGLDY|5|I ordered this and was completely impressed with the quality. However I ordered the wrong size.  My mistake.<br />The return process was seamless.  I have since ordered the correct size and is currently being processed.
B008BTAUV6|5|8016L Beast. 6' feet long And so far so good. Definitely a necessary added security needed for motorcycles.
B007IVSMTA|5|It actually covers the whole windshield and provides great protection from the sun.
B000A835AY|2|Very streaky and dries out really quick. Will definitely stick to the bottle and rag next time.
B00DKDSWGI|1|It was ordered to fit a 1985 Chevrolet K20 long bed pickup. I contacted Draw-Tite customer service to verify the fitment before I ordered the hitch and was assured it would fit. I appears that the cut out in the side frames would fit around the rear spring hangers. If you place the notch over the rear spring hangers with 2 bolt holes behind the hanger and 1 in front of it the hitch is so far under the truck there is no way to hook up to a trailer. I tried to place the entire hitch behind the rear spring hanger and the hitch hangs off the rear fo the frame by 6 inches. Another issue is these trucks have a cross member that is rivited to the underside of the frame in the mounting area that will not let it sit flat aginst the frame. I ordered a Curt after returning this one. It fits between the spring hanger and rear of frame, has a long tube to reach the rear of the truck, and has spacers to work around the cross member. They only built these trucks for 15 years so it may have been difficult to locate one to actually test the fit before selling them for this application. Nice hitch for something else.
B00GVFOTBY|5|Applied well, no bubbles and looks great on my horse trailer!
B0076PKC0K|4|Receding in timely manner.  Great fit. Perfect functioning. Installed by dealer.
B007VTQ9T4|4|It works ok. I paint goalie masks and trying to find something that stays put on the curves and contours of that nature with out bleeding by is really a challenge.
B007PENKI8|5|I bought this to air up the inside dual tires of my RV. It is working great.
B000WQGQ96|1|over priced
B000GV5PMQ|5|Really easy to install in my 2006 Kawasaki Ninja EX250f. It took about about 2hrs for a first timer, and having an extra pair of hands helps. As you remove the clip-ons, having someone there to hold the handle bar with the master cylinder is very helpful in keeping air out of your brake lines.<br /><br />An other useful tool is a pair of 3 to 4 inch Jaw pullers, to compress the cap as you remove the retainer ring (check out ninja250 wiki for more tips)<br /><br />I weigh 200lbs and usually carry about 25 lbs of gear and supplies. This improved my handling a lot. Way less brake dive.. WAY LESS. Not too stiff either. I feel more road bumps, but it no longer bottoms out on speed bumps, and the bike feels much more planted and happy in the twisties.<br /><br />Everything needed comes in the box. Springs, spacer material, and extra washers if you want to tune preload (I kept it stock).<br /><br />I kept the oil weight at the stock 10wt for now, but I have noticed compression oscillation very infrequently, and may move up to 15wt just to see the difference. I'm reluctant because, it feels fine most of the time, and replacing the oil is a lot of work (relatively).<br /><br />Highly recommend if you're a heavier or taller rider on a light bike.
B00CU4KGK8|5|As a shade it works flawless! The largest plus is that it's cut out to fit your vehicles windshield almost perfectly. The reason it doesn't cover every inch of the windshield is for easy installation and breakdown; no more having to bend or tuck it to get it to clear your center rear mirror, just slide the bottom of the windshield shade to the lower end of your windshield and lift straight up and hold it in place with your sun shades. Overall, I am extremely satisfied!
B000COMXI6|5|This feels twice as heavy compared to the cheap one(fell apart) that I bought online from you know who.
B004VR08IW|1|I purchased these for my 2007 Silverado back in 2012.  At the time I was satisfied with my purchase.  It was a pretty easy install and they looked great.<br /><br />Present day...the rubber foot pad on the driver's front door is disintegrating and falling to pieces after 3 years of Virginia weather.  The other foot pads get much less use, but are also starting to deteriorate.  Soon the rubber on the driver's door will be gone completely and it will look awful.  I'm not looking forward to having to shell out more $$$ to replace these after only 3 years.
B00DOTF6R6|5|Good quality. solid material.
B00QN8PWLU|4|I needed the cut outs for the tags on the liscence plate to be on the bottom, so I can't use these.  But they are great frames and I would love to be able to
B0013T7OL0|4|Looks nice with my VW interior. Not overly rugged, which makes it soft to sit upon. Not as cool as cloth, but much more comfortable than vinyl seats.
B00G8UNQQ6|5|Easy install, bright, and exactly what I asked for.
B003Z55XKO|5|great pads
B00SI6V2IM|5|just as listed
B000SM6OD2|5|Its oil, works as expected
B002XM5G70|5|Great price on this pump. Direct fit for the old one it replaced and the job took about 15 minutes. Perfect!
B00CXWS5SC|5|A bit of a pain getting it on, really have to manipulate it, but it works awesome and I love it. Especially for the price!!
B0002JMIEK|5|Been using this product for 20 years now.
B00D46P06G|2|Doesn't fit on my Harley grips.
B00O96VV3G|1|Disappointed in quality!!!
B00IGGQCCK|5|Fit like a glove
B00IB1X6N8|5|We ordered these for a customer and put them on his Jeep Wrangler. He was a VERY satisfied customer.<br /><br />Thanks iAuto, Inc.
B00873J0YY|5|Love it
B006T26UGG|4|Good fit!
B00KTHVBW0|5|Shipped quickly, arrived on time. The old circuit board fit right into this shell perfectly. Ordering a new one from Honda would have been very expensive, this was an incredibly good deal.
B00THR39SC|5|Look great , but was missing roughly 10 of the fender retainers had to purchase additional ones.
B00395L908|4|Works well however the extra buffetting loosened my hatch seal
B001VJZII8|1|Died after warranty was expired. Only used the gauge a few times, replacing battery did not fix the issue.
B0079JX4JO|1|didn't do job  please sen refund as you agreed!
B000EALHH6|5|Great
B00DDOSKBG|5|My RV is a brighter less power hungry place. I lost an expensive house battery due to too many deep discharges in storage with a light left on &#60;oops&#62;. With _all_ lights on we draw less, and the 100W panel on the roof can keep up preventing a discharge. 20 bulbs pricetag is cheap insurance against missing a box on the checklist.
B003ZGKKD8|5|Very satisfied
B0013916XW|4|They look pretty good. Easy to install. I just wish they were a bit larger and covered more of the painted areas. Bought them for my wife's jeep and she loves them.
B00JHQ7PZQ|5|not a bad deal.
B005CLP8XG|5|Great product, Thanks.
B002X1NLOQ|5|Great quality. Expect to last for at least 15 years (that's what the original plastic one lasted.)
B000W0WSPI|5|Works as it should .....it is well worth it to acquire this wrench because without it removing the fan clutch is almost impossible.
B003VLBPJA|2|It is way smaller than i expected. the hooks are flimsy and do not fit on the bars of my ATV
B00HDM1YJY|5|Soft cloth, stays in place with rubber backing. Love it! I use it after working out and when I wear jeans that rub color onto the seat. Protects perfectly. Easy to put on and easy to remove, roll up and put away.
B008FYMR68|5|Loved it! Looks great.
B000NNKN8S|1|Not waterproof. Light rain soaks through.
B00KGP8IHQ|5|great for the money.
B00B3YKUDY|5|Loved it!!!  Lots of room and pockets
B00CD2RBZ0|5|Didn't like the gasket at all
B003TTL0TE|4|Good quality car wash mitt.
B0009IQZQG|5|They work very well and can be reused after washed.
B004RNR9QY|5|Flexible and seem to be durable.Bought it for the sole purpose of transfering clornated water for hot tub from a 300 gallon water tank.Have only used it 1 time to fill up hot tub and it worked great.
B0037R8EAQ|1|Didn't fit my vehicle as told it would
B00YY7M4AO|5|Works as advertised. Would recommend. Fast shipping.
B00JQQJOEW|5|Great item  easy to install  my radio sounds great  Great price for the antenna. Five stars 💫💫💫💫💫
B0045L914Q|5|Works great .
B005MIPW7Q|5|Perfect quality and fit.
B006UH66R8|5|It was what the job called for!!
B00ARJQ08A|4|Worked better that previous one, good price
B0042OX8WC|5|great quality good price
B008BHP68A|5|Dealer cracked the old plastic housing and it was too tight to remove so I broke it on its way off with a screwdriver/hammer combo to get it off.  This is a welcome replacement.  Get this product &#34;ABN Toyota / Lexus 6 - 8 Cylinder Oil Filter Wrench&#34; as well, fits perfectly on and makes quick work of the biggest hassle of the oil change.  I so highly recommend replacing now instead of waiting until the plastic one fails.
B0006305RY|5|Second purchase of this fine product. The first purchase of two bottles was from a retail store. Saw a significant improvement after the 2nd bottle.<br />This 7 bottle purchase from Amazon will be the first of an ongoing purchase ...this time I plan on using in all three of my cars. Great product and price.
B00FEZLTTC|5|The chrome grill fit perfectly it's a great look for my BMW X5 E70 . THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
B00UYMRNOU|5|Worked great
B001FAM37M|3|Thought the finish was textured but isn't.  More like a semi-gloss.
B0046IC24O|4|Good quality looks just like OEM one. However, be ready to change the battery after a couple of weeks because it won't last. In fact it died while I was out and I had manually lock and unlock it.
B00PSPSC20|4|Excellent safety locking nut.  Very strong and easy to attach, lock and unlock and de-attach.  Comes with two keys which is good.  I leave one on the boat and the other in the vehicle with which I tow my boat.  Definitely recommend.
B00KALE1IQ|3|first shipment take so long and second this is not black this is Gray but easy to install and stick good
B00FBPM5WK|5|Very nice quality for the price!
B00JQPZT8I|5|I was worried this would not fit but actually it was a great match and very easy to install with help from u tube
B00DB8S92E|5|awesome
B008BYQ6ZK|5|Can't beat CD!
B0036Z899U|3|Nice
B0024NSGYS|5|Thanks very much for the replacement lights, they look very nice on my car.
B002N5DE2G|5|always handy to have in the trailer
B00K0SAQSS|1|This was plastic.  I got the impression it was metal, like the one I was replacing.  Did not fit on my truck,  either.
B000PSW398|5|Good stuff.
B002YKFA3G|5|Just right. Light comes on when it is hooked up.  Didn't think it was necessary, but now I like to be able to glance at it and know it is still attached.
B004C26TD4|4|Great place for my glasses as well
B004RFKBEO|5|Well made, works great.
B0030M4KP6|4|Great fog lights. Used to replace my stock ones, that were removed with the stock bumper. Actually brighter than my stock headlights.
B000CIPUR8|1|Waste of money.  I followed the directions and it didn't work.
B00SEN2QX4|3|I'm disappointed that the sticker edge is cut so close to the lettering. The lettering doesn't have adhesive so I've seen some lifting after only a couple of weeks on the car despite proper application. It's still a very fun sticker for a Packers fan, I just wish there was adhesive on the entire back or a larger clear border.
B00IS94UCY|5|Installation was quick. It took me less than an hour to install the entire set.
B00MY5MQ6A|1|Does not keep bike from starting<br />Keeping me from insuring my son doesn't ride unattended
B0001XPCCM|5|Excellant!
B001NZZAGU|5|good
B004UPZXI0|5|OUTSTANDING  a gallon should last 5 years just spritz a little bit and here comes the shine
B00WMD8FNW|5|Great product.
B00QL6PJY4|5|Excelent fitmen
B00KTHXYO8|5|Excellant
B004FFEAJS|3|Maybe it was just my fan, but I found that the tester didn't work as expected. I would have liked to have had two or three tester clips to test weight and more weights. Maybe there is a different 'wobble' issue with my fan, I couldn't get the chains to stop clinking into the glass covering of the light. I'm going to try a weighted string next.
B00VK0ATNC|5|Great product, wish the packaging was better to indicate the color. Had to hook up to a 12v battery to determine
B00KL0CU5C|5|PERFECT FIT FOR MY 2015 GENESIS 5.0! EXCELLENT QUALITY, NOT SOME FLIMSY, CHEAP ONE LIKE ONE MIGHT SEE IN OTHER CARS. THIS WAS MADE FOR THIS MODEL OF AUTOMOBILE.
B00EKN8FXC|4|Easy install. Better lighting than 921 buld. Great price. Converted entire RV for less than$100.00.
B00W8LR61K|2|Not quite the right fit. Two of my guards fell off because of the adhesive not being strong enough. I had them put on by my boyfriend who is a mechanic and he cleaned it previously just like it said but it still came off. You get what you pay for I guess. Not bad for the 26$ I paid..
B001EHABRK|5|Excellent. Worked perfectly in my 04 cobra.  Much easier to push the pedal in combined with quadrant.
B00V03TY1W|4|good value.
B0077FJA20|5|In stalled yesterday no problem on my XG350
B009DJTRA8|5|delivery in the park working perfectly
B004ALK5O6|5|Worked on my 1984 Winnebago Cheifton Chevy p-30 motorhome.
B0049JC7D6|5|Perfet fit, fast S&H&#62; +++++
B007EXPEBG|5|No Problems.
B00M0A118S|5|Love them!!!!!
B00P9LWRXS|5|Given that I've replaced the genuine Land Rover / BMW part 5 times because the seal leaks, if this aftermarket part lasts16 months, it will exceed my OEM parts results. It has the same weight and feel as the genuine part. The coolant sensor is blue and looks identical to the OEM. It was an exact fit replacement on a 2005 Range Rover HSE full size.
B000C5PZP8|5|Good quality wires by NGK at a price much cheaper than the crappy ones at your local parts store.
B000C16XPI|5|Working great for one month old!
B000NPIYM8|5|Have found (or not) many leaks using this product. FYI its a pain to clean and remove if you ever spill or change coolant. Glows when leaking and easy to see with uv light
B008427D88|5|Works as advertised.  These have been welcome replacements for old clips that hold on the panels under my bumper and various other coverings.  Recommend.
B00C7I4PL8|5|We bought these to use in hanging our lights on the canopy of the camper. Now we use them for everything we need to close. Long lasting and great product for many household uses.
B00D8LSK6O|5|Loved the sticker. It went on easily and looks great
B000IEZELS|3|Three stars only because the clear coating over the Ventshade is coming off. Fits my car perfectly!
B004A6RCRE|5|I have always bought Moog brand and all their parts are excellent. They are the best.
B00JJZ2LEU|3|Close but not exact.  The part is the right length and fits fine on against the glass end.  However, the end that snaps on to the mount on the hatch door itself was a different size.  The post on the door was a larger diameter ball than the fitting on the supports themselves.  I was able to take the fittings off of the old supports and and get them to work on the new supports but I wasn't really expecting to have to modify the supports to get them to work.
B00192JFBI|5|Bought these to prevent the wasps and mud dobbers from entering the heater of the motorhome.  Easy to install and works perfectly.
B00EDEHU7U|1|They said that this fit most cars for the license plate. I have a very common car and it didn't fit mine. Way too big. Very disappointed.
B00AOK8MJM|5|I installed it myself on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited (3.6L Pentastar). The directions were very clear and easy to follow. I have had it on for about a week now, and ... I LOVE IT!<br /><br />I have used K&N intakes in most of my previously owned trucks/SUVs, and I have NEVER been this satisfied! I can actually feel a little pep in it's performance, I notice a quicker, and more aggressive acceleration than before. And that sound... WOW! ... It just GROWLS during normal driving conditions, & ROARS to life when you get on it! I could not be more excited!<br /><br />I am a aFe Power believer now, and will be purchasing aFe parts for all of my vehicles from here on out!
B000CIK7Y4|5|First off I didn't get this through Amazon.  Shipping was taking to long so I cancelled and bought it elsewhere.  Once I received this product it was a easy install in under 30 minutes.  The sound quality is SICK!  Just awesome is all I can say.
B00BEY9750|4|It was great! The writing on the back was very small though.
B00KTIYXLU|4|It was good and very easy to do.
B00P7CAATW|4|When I first received the plastics they had many scratches and imperfections. I messaged them and they worked really well with me and sent out new parts for the ones with imperfections. I'm glad they were so understanding
B000MCXOR2|4|Was not what I was looking for. However the quality was worth the price being asked.
B00ZVJ3CH8|1|Rcvd. the wrong colors.  I had to pay the shipment back. Now no covers
B00843V8WO|5|Fits good. Looks good.  I'm glad I made the purchase.
B000CC9CUA|5|Works perfect.. Noticed lower and midrange power.
B00B4XBQPU|5|Very Nice
B000CO66FC|5|Best brakes ever for my 2005 STi. The car stops wayyyyyy quicker than it ever did with stock brake pads. I feel like I can stop from 60 to 0 within 2 seconds.
B006OEJKWA|5|replaced both my lower inner bushing 1 was bad but replaced both anyways feels a lot better.
B009XPCHF4|4|The front don't fit on my SE AWC lancer otherwise great and good quality
B00NGIE1TE|5|love it work great
B00PV37ZEA|5|tons of space, use it as a trash for my car, friends never leave stuff in my car again, super helpful
B008CLMG6K|5|Excellent replacement.
B008FCE6KK|5|Great product and service. Exactly what I needed and arrived on time before our trip started.
B00LHB08C6|5|so cute and I get lots of complements
B006QKIOLU|5|Fit perfectly and great price!
B00QU9RJF4|5|Great
B001JT14SI|3|This cable is. Fine for cb use but not ham radio, too much loss in the cable
B00G25GOCA|5|It is magical.
B00BR08G1W|5|So far as lasted thru 4 car washes, happy with my purchase
B00ONH5JA2|5|Works great
B0009IK5VC|5|Got this for my daughter, she is happy that her windshield does not steak when using her wipers.
B006EFUMEE|5|The pitman arm of pitman arms for the guy with the 03-07 dodge 2500/3500 4x4 that's upgrading to the T-Style steering
B000IYISI4|3|Ok
B00OL0GZP4|4|Nice!
B009YLM3HO|5|everything was great ,fast shipping ,product was as described
B0006MQJ1G|5|This was for a gift.  Just what he wanted
B002R8HMAY|5|Great kit, installed without issue and the parts matched perfectly to the ones I removed.
B001KSCQOE|5|This was a perfect fit for my 2003 Chevy Duramax 2500HD. Easy install with no issues.
B01092IEEM|4|Perfect fit.
B0051PJWQW|4|work good made my headlight  look very nice
B0016HNPNU|5|Right parts!
B004AGIIYU|5|Great rotors. Fast shipping
B004X973EA|5|#1 prefered brand.
B003TQCTM4|5|This seat absolutely transformed my Nomad.  I now can ride until the tank runs dry and have zero discomfort.  With the factory seat I felt confined to one spot and the padding was far too soft.  The backrest on the Mustang seat is amazing and can be adjusted for any size rider.  I should have bought this seat a long time ago - well worth the price of admission.
B007Y86B5O|5|It working good
B0006307GI|5|Good part. No issues after 6 months.
B00EWIS2R4|5|The biggest sticker is bigger then I thought! Good quality!
B00MO20BYW|3|It was okay. I really liked the color of the blue, but the sheet it is printed on really stood out and looked like press and seal saran wrap on my computer. I still have it on and it hasn't peeled off so that is a good thing.
B00WXES6C0|5|Worked great and fast shipping
B008SEJO66|5|they on time good shape when they on my car i give a update then but so far not bad for the price
B000J15THO|5|Your car may feel a little bit sluggish as you drain out your old worn out fluid and filled with new one.<br /><br />While it may feel a little sluggish, it's absolutely smoother and quieter.
B000BGOJCS|5|Has worked well. Good value. All plastic and a bit cheap feeling, but seems solid despite the light weight. Would recommend and buy again.
B00R3LYF7S|5|Absolutely love my new organizer! It fits perfectly in the back of my new Kia Soul!  I bought it to keep liquids and stuff from spilling all over my new carpet in my trunk....and it works perfectly.
B00WAQ9RW4|1|it doesnt fit, whats the point in getting the better price when they dont work?
B00JH25FLG|5|Got this for  our 4 wheeler at a great price.  Worked exactly as it was expected to.
B00079FOK0|1|The cartridge is different from those I bought previously. The cartridge is very difficult to come off, I guess this entire mask was meant to be disposable The particulate filters I have wont fit into this. Very disappointed. Buyer be wear!!!!!!
B0072P8T9U|5|works great
B00KTHWXH2|5|:)
B004JWNN5O|5|Excellent buy. Perfect for doing it yourself. A real Money saver.
B008VPAPZG|2|Case does not securely close and can be popped open easily.
B00GGRQZ50|5|I display this proudly.
B00SUTHIVM|5|I love it! It is better than I expected. Just the right size to fit in the trunk of my 2005 Acura TL. It has plenty of space and is quite sturdy. I especially like that it is collapsible!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend it to my friends.
B00QTG49B0|5|Nice design.  This my second dashcam and lukas is far superior.  1080p is still a little too low resolution to read license plates over 20-30 ft.
B00JR4D7AA|5|works great
B004BPAF1Y|5|It's a great looking frame on my white car. Even my boys like it! They think it's &#34;cool.&#34;
B00LNDP9CW|5|very satisfied. high quality
B00D3R393W|3|Part worked fine but was not complete assembly as picture portrayed. The shaft was NOT included.
B011M7JBGI|5|I love it fast delivery.
B001DDMB2I|2|Beware, Product only has 10 jet cleaners total, nothing additional, 11 pieces total if you count the case, not the 14 pieces as advertised.  It seems to be a torch cleaning tool otherwise, You can find a better tool for the money.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|These are great reverse light replacements (that's what I'm using them for anyway).  They are very bright, so it's easier to see when backing up, and they are a more white color than the stock bulbs, and I just think that looks classier.  I've only had these LEDs installed for a few weeks, so I can't speak on their longevity, but so far they are awesome.  Only issue is they wash out my backup camera view a little bit due to their brightness, but the items on the pro list are worth it.
B00CO8UHRW|1|Fit my GPS, but wouldn't be supported by the programming on my Garmin. So I'm unable to use it, and am having to send it back.
B007X4FD7Q|5|Exactly what I expected and worked just fine at a much less expensive price than purchasing it at the auto parts store.
B00474A1M2|5|Works as it should.
B000C9OJBU|5|Fit correctly and seems to be good quality and perform as expected.
B006QH6XQG|1|Good price quick shipping and Optima is the best battery period. Update barely lasted a year, Refused to replace and tried to pawn warranty off on manufacturer even though manufacturer explicitly contacts authorized dealers to honor all warranty issues.
B0009IBJBM|5|I use it for electrolysis.  Works great
B0066TNJZ2|5|Item arrived in good packaging and has been working fine
B00Q57R2K8|5|The pipes are great , thanks will do more shopping with you.
B000FQ7NV8|5|Great fit on a 2003 jeep tj.no clue why the bad reviews.They look great!!!! No they don't come with black screws but take 5 min and paint the stock ones semi flat black.
B004UPZXQM|5|Very nice
B0016WIWXI|1|Worked great for a year. Easy install and use..<br /><br />A year later and it is stuck in the locked position. That would be fine but I really need the tools out of there and don't want to cut my cover open to do it.
B00MATVMC4|5|love it
B00ZJPN4CW|1|Didn't fit!!<br />They said it would. Oh well I ever learn
B007TY0E1K|1|Inferior to OEM if you are looking for a part that will last keep looking.  Lasted 1 10th of the OEM I would rather pay the 166$ for another factory set.
B00CO86Q5O|1|Okay first off before you buy this, you have to know that this is not engraved. Its a black plastic plate with two stickers. Yes, stickers, two unprotected stickers. It is also not a lucasfilm ltd. product. So it is a boot leg.  I had bought a real plate, I have a picture of it that i am going to share.
B000NU5LP6|4|It definitely quiteted the rear end on my F150.
B000CD37XC|5|Returned
B002ZBY9HW|5|good deal and fast shipping.
B00FC22N06|1|Extremely difficult to install. I had to splice the wires together to install in my car. You cannot simply plug these in unlike Kensun's lights. I didn't know any better bc these were the first ones I bought, but in retrospect they definitely weren't worth it. The lights were very bright however which was good.
B000CN4XZI|1|I tired to use this with Dual Flex-a-Lite fans.... Install was straight forward, however the load rating is not capable of handling what it says its designed for. My fans are rated at 22amp continuous draw. This product states it will handle up to 25amps. Not the case.<br />Sent it back and went with the High Amp Dual fan controller. If you have a single fan this would work great.<br />However the product quality was great. Wires were a good gauge and it has a factory OEM look to it with the harness and plugs.<br />Easy to adjust temperature, although I had to use a very fine tipped flat head screw driver.
B005AUONAS|5|Excellent product, prompt delivery
B00N2BYL4A|5|Fits perfectly and looks great
B00GHT98Y2|5|Perfect fit for my '03 Trailblazer LS EXT...I also got the Chevrolet logo set of 4 decals to put on this one and covered all 3 of th others for a fresh new look!
B00HR26TOU|2|Installed these in a 2016 WRX.  The trunk light and license plate lights are great!  The interior lights leave a little to be desired.  They are not very bright (but better than stock).  I've since replaced the map lights and rear dome light with different 29mm 12 LED per piece bulbs that are not only brighter, but a little less bluish (though these are not obnoxiously blue by any means).  Hard to beat the price for the LEDpartsNow lights though.  EDIT:  Not even two months and one of the lights (using to light the license plate) is flickering.  Glad I already switched out the interior ones for a different set of LEDs.
B000C2ACTA|5|The perfect fit!  Just what I needed!  I guess these also work with cars, but I don't know about all that.
B00XPL88NC|5|love it!  great product... does what it's supposed to do and does it well!
B007L6GRR6|1|Don't waste your money won't hold up.drive gear strips off.I only got 5 weeks out of it and after only about 6 starts it began to grind.I was told it only had2 months warranty how convenient.by caltric.
B0071AXTFU|5|Good job
B000BUOSGG|5|Perfect little Dish Drainer for the camper!
B00CU4OPN2|5|Good fit, decent price. Seem to be ok quality as well
B009B7RYDE|2|A very nice sunshade. Perfect fit, rigid walls, reflective backing. Unfortunately, mine was all but destroyed by amazon's shipping. The flimsy box was bent in half at some point, thus crushing the sunshade inside.<br /><br />I'd recommend buying from any other retailer.
B00SALL7VW|5|Exelent product as describe A+++
B005U30IJ0|5|Really dressed up the looks on my 2011 GMC Sierra!
B00H1ES6S6|5|excellent product
B00JM62B7S|5|Stuff is awesome. Best around for chrome
B009F590L6|5|Perfect fit for my 2009 Escape, easy to install. Mine didn't have a hitch before so had to use carrage bolts and square hole washers. Slid hitch under my Suv proped one side up with a concrete block them lifted other into place, used two of the black bolts to slide into two side holes, lifted other side up and a little push to side it went right into place put two black bolts in that side this held hitch in place. There is a slotted hole in bottom of frame in area of bolt holes, this is just big enough to fish washer and carrage thru. Put fish wire thru with bend in it per instructions with washer and bolt threaded on end. Washer goes right in push bolt up to hole it just a little bigger than with of slotted hole, pull it back just a little tilt it to one side it will go right in. This is so much easier than trying to fish wire thru slot in end of frame. Put the bottom bolt thru first and added washer and nut, then pulled out one black bolt fished carrage bolt thru and special washer then to third. Don't tighten bolts up but to finger tight till you get all three bolts in or it might throw your last hole out of alignment and bolt won't go in. I tightened that side up and went to other. Turned out to be fairly easy to install. I used a small pair of needle nose vice gripes not set so tight as to damage threads to hold bolts and take off threading wire and put on nut and washer as not to push it back thru hole. You could get another carrage bolt but not special washer.
B000CMKG6E|5|Very simple and a great buy. I would recommend this to anyone
B0098B6ZQK|5|Great product.  Protects the fob well and Fits perfect.  The lock buttons still work well.  If it matters to you, it does cover the panic button and would make hard to activate if you needed.
B001DYVPTW|5|Kind of a pain to install due to having to constantly thread and rethread everything over and over again, but the instructions are very clear and the finished product is excellent.  There is no better aftermarket wheel cover that looks and feels as good as this for a civic.  It looked factory installed and covered up the damage 10 years and 200,000 miles did to my wheel.  A very inexpensive option to make your wheel look and feel new.
B004AEQSE4|5|Baddd assss solvent. Super low temp of latent evaporation.
B006ISQMT6|5|did the job as stated
B0050SF27I|4|These muffled the sound a bit more than I would like, but I suppose I can't complain about that. Just be aware that they reduce the exhaust sound by about 90%.
B005BFM0AC|5|what can I say, it's OEM transmission fluid
B0013REXO8|5|Love this look!
B000GV51BG|5|Quick delivery product as expected.
B000T2NAVU|4|I really haven't used it long enough to see if it's going to work.
B0002STSTY|4|Good quality plastic with strong magnets.
B0002YUQ4E|5|Best polish for C7 Corvette exhaust tips!! A+ results
B0043M6BPO|2|Had a nice assortment of Jets. That was the good part. The adjustable needle doesn't work on 06 and newer. They don't tell you that. You can't adjust the idle. We have 3 trx250s. One is 05 it worked fine in that one. But didn't in the 07 and 08.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Look and work great!
B00KTIF9KO|5|Worked great
B004C1XQWM|5|excellent add on for my bike
B00AR5RKFQ|5|It fits perfectly and works great!!
B00VKNO7BO|5|Works as it should with no issues.
B000ZATL50|5|i have these front bucket seat covers for my 1999 Lexus RX300. Very good fit and finish. Would buy again.
B008FRISTA|3|Didn't increase my gas mileage by any substantial amount
B005OV4Q3M|5|The part is exactly what I needed to repair my car.
B007VWYJS4|4|Meets my expectations.
B0038B4BT4|5|I was satisfied with the product and it looks great on my truck.
B00LM03YFA|5|This filter perfectly fits my 2014 Lexus GS350 (4th gen GS).<br />It is very similar to the filter that came with my car and is much cheaper than the Lexus 87139-30100.<br />I will be buying this filter from now on.
B00ZVJ3EHQ|3|Item Not delivered on time.<br />Product was great though.
B008RH73L2|5|I like it. My dog could care less sense it's not edible.
B009MBAXWS|2|My 2010 f150 tailgate was all scratched up so I thought I'd try this liner.<br /><br />Pros: Super easy install, and it looked good.<br /><br />Cons: The fit becomes loose in the summer but that's no big deal.<br />The major flaw is with the 3 plastic &#34;extrusion&#34; pieces which slide between a steel plate and hold the liner in place at the top of the gate. Since the plastic piece is not one long strip it creates gaps that become 'grab points' when sliding things in and out of the truck. You can easily cut yourself on the lip if you're not careful.  Unfortunately a 2x4 already ripped part of the lip and made it worse. If the lip is not installed properly the liner could rip off at highway speeds so I'll probably be recycling this thing soon.<br /><br />Check out the youtube install video for a visual. As far as I can tell the problem is only with 09-14 Ford tailgates. It does not appear that GM gates require the extrusion piece.
B00UAW0RFQ|5|Fits perfectly after change oil service.
B000M3V95U|5|best glass cleaner out there - should be in hardware stores..
B00LCB0VCI|5|They work as expected... when i programed one of them it didn't work. call the provider and send a replacement right away ! good service !!
B000ALG86E|5|it's good
B002672U7G|1|Item was purchased at a huge discount.  Lamps did not work.  Not worth the trouble to send back.
B000EQM0X0|5|great item!!!! works great!!! A+
B00029J3IY|1|Doesn't fit my 1999 Jeep Grande Cherokee, the inlet and outlet holes are huge compared to the original tailpipe.
B0009LSXAE|5|Product as promised
B00RW4JRRE|2|Vent shades are too thin, warped easily
B00SO9GYNQ|5|Super easy to install and seems to fit perfectly! Completed the install in about 30 minutes. This product looks just like the MB offering but at a fraction of the cost!<br />My install was made easy by using two inline wife connectors and attaching them to ground and DRL as identified in my attached photos.
B006PIHT82|5|Perfect
B00F5GVOX6|5|Love this car decal. I placed it on my rear window soon as I got it. Went through a snowy winter and it is still intact. This was 5 months ago.
B003TQ2W44|5|So far so good.  I checked a few tires, and it holds the pressure till you hit the release button.  I would only know the accuracy if I could test it against one of those master test guage things.  (whatever they're called), but from the reviews it looks and seems just fine.
B000IG20RW|5|Good price.
B007GMDF3O|5|wrong one but returned for right one works real good catches other driver attention
B00TFNU24W|4|Just what I needed.
B00W8ADB1K|5|It's a nice bag and does a great job but it's just too small. If you are looking for a smaller bag this is a great bag.
B002YKGLUW|4|like it. works ok
B000CMHVH6|5|Good product
B0039XB1DU|5|Great ride
B001O0XP0M|1|Purchased these pads for my 1991 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 Coupe. The listing states the following:<br /><br />Wagner ThermoQuiet MX345 Semi-Metallic Disc Pad Set, Front<br /><br />However, according to Amazon, they fit the REAR (which is where I needed them - photo attached). Upon arrival, the pads are totally the WRONG SIZE for either the front OR rear of the vehicle. They are way too big for the rear calipers and too small for the front. The only pads that I have found on Amazon that fit a 1991 Porsche 911 C2 Coupe in the rear are found below for $105.84 a set as of August 12, 2015:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Porsche-90-91-REAR-Brake-Textar/dp/B00H0QQ0XS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439413466&sr=8-1&keywords=964-352-949-03<br /><br />You can also find the pads at Pelican Parts at:<br />http://www.pelicanparts.com/catalog/SuperCat/0841/POR_0841_BRKPAD_pg1.htm#item2<br /><br />The pads that were on the vehicle when I pulled them out were Textar, part # 964-352-949-03 ($81.75/set  on Pelican Parts).<br /><br />I'm not sure what these Wagner pads are supposed to even fit, but they do not fit a '91 C2, that's for sure. I'm returning these immediately, as they are useless. I wish someone had reviewed these before, so hopefully this will help future potential buyers.
B007AOSAM4|4|The fit is not as perfect as it should be but it's acceptable. Make sure that you have a stable hand to cut the top part of the liner (if you have a full size spare tire). Anyway, this is a good product.
B003BZZAOM|5|Worked great in my 1940 Ford fordor.  Screwed in original master cylinder and fixed my brake light issue.
B000H7CKAY|5|I use it to lubricate the supercharger and intercooler on my '14 Kawasaki Ultra 310R Jetski. Seems to work great though I haven't opened up either the Intercooler or supercharger to see what it's actually doing inside, but the owners manual recommends you spray this kind of oil into the specially designed nipple fitting after you use the ski.
B001D9E41I|5|Bought one and it fit and worked so well that I ordered 2 more!  I live in AZ and it's 117 in the shade and 130+ in direct sun.  We live in our RV full time and the heat/sun is brutal!  These sun shields do a good job.  You can feel the difference.  And when you pull the shield away from the window/door you can certainly feel the heat on one side and the cool on the other.  We have one up on the door and the two others in windows.
B000GZOIGG|4|Great grips, but a pain to install
B0033DGX84|5|Great fitment
B00NB8T1QC|5|Love the bulbs. Easy to put in and makes my 2006 van look new!!!
B00ABYVT64|5|Quality spray bottle. I use these for various cleaning jobs and love the spray functions controlled by turning the spray cap.
B00L3FNG34|4|not long enough for my tank but works
B0048FWGSC|5|very good item the protection is incredible
B00J7XSNZU|5|I used this to bring 20 yr old leather seats back to life. Worth the money to me.
B00GRHRTEU|4|Very good product.  A little bit hard to keep adjusted, but they are really just to stay legal with the doors off.
B00E7G2CA4|4|Just what I also needed
B00AQZAWMK|5|My wheel is still attached
B0002JMUZW|5|Oem fit and you cant  beat the price. i got this for a 97 Ford expedition 5.4L
B004UR2KHU|5|great
B00CG5RYEW|5|This sticker is just perfect !! :)
B000AMBNPY|4|works okay in my friend's sedan but is a little too large there, and was far too small for my coupe.  Works great for keeping the sun off and still allowing you to see, though.  I'm taking off a star because this should be labeled as for sedans only.  Measure before you buy!
B0002JMEJ4|5|Excellent Transaction, excellent product... thanks
B001GS0DJ8|1|Not a good design<br />Probably restricts the window from fully closing
B0081SBTZ8|1|Claims to work on 1998 Honda trx300ex but it doesn't work. What a WASTE of time!
B004T5X1EE|5|great no problems
B004AA1PUK|5|Perfect fit.  Saved a good gas can from being replaced.
B007KPR5QA|5|This is the second one that I've bought.....over the years I've purchased three other types and this is THE BEST !  Remember, it doesn't take very much air to inflate it to just right.
B004GE6VAO|5|Great!
B003YO25WU|1|Does NOT fit my 2014 Lexus GS50 (4th gen GS).  Amazon, Advanced auto parts, Auto Zone, etc. are all wrong.<br />Lexus 87139-30100 or TYC 800179C is what you need.
B00KV9A8D4|1|These did not fit my gmc jimmy pretty upset. How do I go about returning them.
B002DLYR8A|4|Cheap and came way fast. I didn't use them for steam punk like all of the amazing other photos, but rather for my Ramona flowers cosplay. It's a good buy and I don't see them brakin anytime soon.
B00VHDTM94|5|PERFECT!
B004A6FBD6|5|Just what I needed - easy to install, quite and complete wiping. Had it for 2 month so far, no signs of wear/tear, will update review if there will be.
B003SY3D4A|2|With this many reviews that state the fit issue with the side marker light, it looks like Eagle Eyes would remove these from the market<br />It was to late for me I will read reviews in the future
B002EW5FLQ|5|This product met my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised no scrubbing necessary. I found depending on how much you spray the scent can become strong--wear a mask.  The bottom line the product does work.
B000EVYGZA|5|worked great when i needed to test a battery the other day.  pretty pleased with it
B000C9SRD6|5|Awesome
B007D5UWZI|5|It has wrong perfectly
B005RJ3GBE|1|Do not match battery pattern as my old.
B00KN2ITS0|5|Looks great
B003V57NUQ|3|Acceptable, but not the quality of a Thule.  You get what you pay for.
B00HH3JWOS|5|Very easy to install...they help other people see you!...these are very bright and nice!...weather proof!!...arrived quickly!
B00A4GBXUQ|1|I have no complaints.
B007W45GWE|3|Needs modification to fit 2003 K24 Accord. They have a MAP sensor not MAF sensor. You have to drill the hole for it and cap off the maf sensor mounting area.
B000C57O5W|5|Perfect fit for the front of my 1998 Mustang. Quick to install, no issues with the part at all, and it rides great. I would definitely buy them again.
B00DSD586W|5|Looks amazing and great quality.
B00DC45Y1G|2|Loved the look of them but the installation required too much work.  The installation required the weatherstrip around the window is to be removed/taken out of the track, little brackets (included) and adhesive for them to be properly installed.  It stated in the instructions, installation by a certified Mitsubishi service center is recommended.  The service charge per hour was over $100.  Absolutely not worth it!!  I returned them and will get window vents that are much easier to install!
B003CEFJ2A|2|Pro's:  holds dust out<br />  looks cool for a few months till fades<br />  does keep the rattling noise down a little<br /><br />Con's:  holds water in<br />  fades in a few months
B002YKHRUK|5|Solidly built. Performed as expected. Don't use locking pliers on hosing; do it right.<br />For $10 you can get a set, and still have change for a taco.
B00390S59Q|5|Looks good on my truck.
B006B2X7OM|5|Good fit Crome is of good quality buy these if you want a great sound and look
B006P86XV6|5|Great patch!
B002M2MMXM|4|Nothing fancy. it didn't give my car wings or anything but all 4 of them work without misfiring..Perhaps notable considering my d17a2 engine appears to have the dreaded pinhole head gasket pushing water out the bottle issue and hasn't fouled one yet..Check your gaps carefully, as mine arrived with all different settings, likely from rough handling in shipping. Avoid damaging the tiny platinum tips by using the proper tool to bend the arm as needed
B000KZ20HG|5|I could not get it to work at first. So I called for assistance. The gentleman I spoke with was extremely nice and very helpful, kind, and prompt. He was able to assist me and had my FOB working with.  Five minutes!  I will be buying another one to have for an emergency. Thanks so much!!  Fast delivery too
B005AT1M12|5|Excellent works well on my fj
B001PVQUWA|5|Perfect
B00HS5IQ2O|5|Good
B001BDPGCM|5|Bought this for my 93 Ford F150. Amazing product. Quicker starting, smoothed out idling, and increased throttle response. Can't beat the price.
B00J2G5E7C|5|took a while to get.  i wasnt expecting it to be solid metal but it is, so that was cool.  The adhesive is strong. just clean the surface well.
B00OH0S5Y2|5|Nice and (White)bright as expected from JDM!  Almost too bright, lol.  I planned putting tint over the marker light I used it for, just haven't yet.  Once I do that it will be perfect.  JDM's lights are always White, if you buy other cheaper ones, they tend to have a blue color to them.  You can see the difference in the pictures, with led, and with normal OE bulb.
B00BYH6C1E|5|No more fishing for the keys that you manage to drop between the seats and center console, not to mention the french fries that seem to fly down that space also.  Fits snuggly.
B000C34L2I|5|Correct fit
B00230OOPW|3|I bought this gasket for my 2006 HD FLHTCUI Electra Glide Ultra Classic (1450cc with stage 2, 1550cc) Police Special Edition.  The gasket looks like it is of great quality, but it doesn't seat against the motor due to an inner raised edge that is apparently supposed to align with the primary chain case opening.  The five bolt holes align perfectly and the gasket diameter/overall size is correct as well.  I contacted the seller for clarification and am awaiting their response.
B00CSBQ0OE|4|This kit doesn't include a primer check valve. Perhaps it was intended for a application that doesn't have a primer or the primer and check valve is part of a separate kit.
B00EQVTOEC|2|These plugs don't seem to be made of the correct metal. I tested an extension cable made with these plugs and they were very sensitive to temperature. I would recommend going to Omega and buying similar plugs that are made with the correct alloy.
B00OO1AIUS|5|I loved the grill but unfortunately i just have it setting in my closet cause i totaled my car before i got to put it on
B00AJLY628|5|I just installed my tuner on my 2007 Ram 2500 Hemi. I used 91 octane gas and selected the higher performance option.  I simply could not believe how great the truck ran. The responsiveness, the acceleration, even the sound was terrific.  The performance tune is supposed to add up to 35 hp. It certainly feels to me like it added more than that. I was expecting to be disappointed, as many performance gadgets do not live up to their claims. But this thing literally blew my socks off.<br /><br />The next thing I'm going to do is install a cold air induction system.  That should Add another 4 to 5 hp, but more importantly it will make the engine sound a lot better. I think I'm gonna love this truck when I get this completed.
B00BLZ45PO|5|Fit perfectly cheaper then auto zone
B00KOGRIGY|3|They're not very bright but that's the only choice I had
B000CFNOYC|5|Fit well, works well...as expected
B00L9VWAUC|5|Parts were easy to order. They arrived on time..They were the right parts and have worked great in my truck!!!<br />Super job!!!
B010ADEP0W|5|Got this item fairly quick!....i own a jonway 50cc and it fit perfectly! ...this item comes with new standard bulbs...i would like to replace those with some l.e.d lights so them item well last longer!......this new front light is tough and well built!
B000OP6KLY|5|It's good.
B00LVHU0KG|5|it went on perfect on my 2003 dodge ram and installation was easy.<br />it was money very well spent, i will order it again if i have to.
B00EVY344K|5|AWESOME...  LOVE THESE
B000GATNPC|5|Great fit.. No way of screwiing up mounting. Sooooo easy to put on fits perfect. They cover whole mirror, not just the half mirror covers I see everywhere else. Good quallity. Hope it holds up over time.
B000JZYS1I|5|Installed gasket on 2.0 liter engine in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 190,000 miles.  Engine functioning properly.
B00KYU719O|5|The paint showed up in a timely manner and the paint worked great (so far).  Directions on the can were okay but I used the &#34;dip your car&#34; website for  truly useful information. good luck
B000C42S0O|4|back to squealing tires!
B00IJJOX8E|5|Great price, nice quality
B008HMS7IK|3|I ordered charcoal grey and but it looks brown in the sun.
B000M5X0IM|4|It's a tire lube applicator.  Try as I might, I just can't &#34;love it&#34;.  It works.  They last a reasonable amount of time.  It's a consumable item, so you probably want to buy more than one if you do a lot of tire mounting.
B001G5Y9XM|5|Exactly what I needed.  Perfect fit.  Thank you
B007TYAOJW|5|Exellente
B004HCM9H4|5|Impressive wax. Doesn't take much to do the job and the included towel and sponge performed great as well! Has a great smell to boot!
B004KEJXZA|1|Terrible product, leaks like crazy even just using it for the first time. Have to use ridiculous amount of arm force. Got the job done but not without leaving at least a quarter of my expensive trans fluid on the garage floor. Since it got the job done it gets a 1 star, otherwise if I didn't it would have given a zero if that was even possible. I'll be getting different brand for the next job, went right into the garbage
B000C5HXLM|4|Fit my  2012 Ford F-150.  Installitation was simple (once I read the directions).  A few months in these wipers are holding up and have proved equal to the OEM's they replaced.
B000CP86ZE|5|Fit great on the Rear of my 2015 Dodge Charger. Used Fatcory Mopar on the Front. The RoadSport guards look great and matches the rear bumper cowling perfectly. I did need to cut a small corner out so it would clear the inner fender molding but no big deal.  Looks as good as factory would, but they dont make rear guards for the 2015 as of yet.  Cheap enough to install and if Dodge gets off their butt and makes factory rear splash guards you can swap them out. But mine turned out so good I doubt I would take them off at all.
B002E4ZY38|5|Installed ignition coil in 2002 Jetta station wagon with 145,000 miles in September 2011.  Now in August 2015 vehicle has 190,000 miles.  Ignition coil has been functioning properly for almost four years and 45,000 miles.
B002IPQ5IG|5|Great Product Thanks!
B00QXDDF6Y|3|radiator was right fan was defective good thing my old fan worked and was just the radiator that i needed
B000BKIGPU|5|works great
B00684THQA|5|Amazing! Easy setup and works like a charm :-)
B005G7Y5I0|5|This is doing what is expected. When put in storage it protects, and keeps the Brakebuddy just like new.
B0009OR8YS|5|High quality tool.  No previous experience flaring tubing but with a little practice, I was able to create a good double flare on a brake line and it does not leak.
B000FOIJXQ|4|Works great and lasts a good amount of time. Be prepared to add multiple coats
B0067ECTZW|5|It's an oil filter. Better than the majority.
B009DJVGZM|5|good part
B004YRES30|5|What's to say? Itsel exactly what it looks like
B0002SQYF0|5|Good Quality
B00480GYSA|5|ok
B001FZNIL2|4|nice
B00ANZHG7C|5|Great to have around.
B001BFTUEA|5|Fits our ml500, matched with akebono pads, flushed and bled the brakes with Super DOT4. Firmer pedal, seems to stop quicker, and wheels stay cleaner longer....
B004XAX7FI|5|best chain
B00MOYJ0YW|5|Love the product, I was looking to have all  LED in my interior car (2015 Honda Pilot Touring 4WD) and now is complete!<br /><br />Light name for mirror is 6641 this kind are very bright.<br /><br />Would highly recommend it.
B00D9E3GTG|4|I bought 3. 1 ripped after a month (2 uses) but my boys were playing tug of war with it. There is a plastic type layer on the underside which makes it nice for dew or wet sand at the beach. I keep one in the trunk so we have it short notice. Works good but not top quality for sure. I paid $11.90 each plus shipping. Not worth the price -$10 w shipping would be more worth it. You should Defiantly buy new only with this.
B000C452JS|4|all good
B0049Z34BE|5|Perfect fir on my 2006 LBZ. I flushed the Power Steering fluid at the same time and has solved the hard steering and whine.
B00030410W|5|Nice
B0002RQ3V6|5|Great product as listed. Fast shipping ! Thanks !
B003O0TSWO|5|Strong enough to open my engine hood and stays up by it self the price is right too!
B00HUVMY9W|1|Broke the 2nd day
B00D7T4LX8|3|Duriable.
B001PJS6QK|3|Works great, but poor design. I'm using it to move the socket from a Warn M8000-S to the hole in my Shrockworks Bumper. The flange is non removable, so the hole has to be big enough for the larger end which attaches to the winch. However, the flange with mounting screws isn't big enough to cover the large hole required for the other end of the plug to fit through!?!
B000CMHP6S|5|Good kit
B001CU1L5U|4|It works ok. I paint goalie masks and trying to find something that stays put on the curves and contours of that nature with out bleeding by is really a challenge.
B006RVIC4W|5|Love these shocks
B00GIY7KPK|5|Great quality. Keeps its appearance over long periods of time Nice glossy finish. Very good.
B00GWGXAC6|3|I have not applied these since i just recieved them yesterday. Quailty feels good, looks nice. I just wish that somewhere in the product description they would have mentioned that this was a large rectangular sticker that would need to be cut to fit. I saw several of these on amazon yet i ordered these because i thought they were precut, either way, i will be installing them soon.
B000765DD6|2|Does not fit the 2000 gmc yukon xl with amber turn lights.
B00J5KRUHM|5|Just what I needed and the prefect size.
B00L2P8EIM|5|Super blue, they look amazing. Every single light worked and was simple to install. This combo pack is a steal!
B00KMDBJNM|5|This is your typical windshield shade. It fits my 2009 Kia Sportage just fine.  You can get the same thing cheaper if you don't want the NFL Logo.  But I did. Go Panthers!
B0000AXDOY|5|used this at my deer camp to hook up a shower! This is a great little pump!
B00LHUI4XM|5|Best of several I've used, excellent quality.
B0050SG9KW|5|Great tool for the professional or home mechanic.
B000VU8YWK|5|Beyond simple installation. Solid construction and loud
B00KSNZJFU|5|Dad loved it. I liked it to looked cheap but not at all great buy you love it cleaned up bike realy well
B006H33ZEC|5|Awesome lights...I don't know what else to say...the supplied wiring is top notch!
B0072GW3F0|5|Nice, exactly what i was looking for, many thanks.
B00L4V9ECY|5|This was just as described and it worked well.  The connectors were better than expected and were sturdy.  I used 3M VHB, dark gray tape to adhere the resistor to the inside of the bumper.  According to the literature, it will withstand 200 degrees-F.  I cleaned both surfaces with an alcohol swab before applying.  Quick and easy was the goal.  [[ASIN:B004V40IUS 3M 4941 VHB Double-Sided Acrylic Foam Tape, 45 mil, 0.5&#34; x 5 Yards (Dark Grey)]]
B00K75UFWQ|5|Easy on and off, covers my 2015 Fusion perfectly!
B00R8KBV9Y|5|Keeps the dust and dirt out of the box in my RAM crew
B000COCWIC|3|Not a snug fit in all cigarette lighters.
B005ESNRL2|5|Our Kia Soul owner/friend was delighted with the gift.
B00T6JI59Y|4|Works fine
B007X590G0|5|This replaces the broken one on our Ranger.
B005TIV1AQ|5|Great savings on this product!
B0030CG1OY|5|Fit perfect no issues it could be a little stronger the motor but it's factory replacement
B0058WXNOK|1|This does not work. It's not worth buying.
B0078YV7GW|4|I absdotely love the looks of this helmet. It is so beautiful and I love the artwork on the outside of it. I am however disappointed it is only dot or at least only says that it's dot certified and not Snell certified as well. I'm also upset at how the padding in the inside fits, its so tight even though I ordered the large, that it pushes my cheeks together and when I take it off it's really hard and it ends up always smearing my makeup all over my face. Ive had three other helmets and never had these issues with them. But overall I still love the helmet.
B0051D3MP6|4|As promised, works well on 6 and 12 volt batteries, use mine for my 05 Road King when it sits longer than I would like it too...definitely good in the winter time
B00MKEZ4RI|5|i like it .but am afraid to put it on my car fearing somebody may steal it and damage my oaint in the process
B00KF9180W|5|Arrived in quick order and are exactly what I expected
B004EY1UYI|1|not worth the money...<br />took it off the bike ...keeps shorting out with every bump...garbage
B00ERYNWVE|5|Great!!
B00IUWM59O|5|good battery
B000GOJWHM|3|Ordered this blower because my original one was plugged up with so much dirt. Tried to clean out the old one but it didn't spin very well. I just ordered this new one because the old one was making a lot of noise. It still worked fine, but I just wanted to be safe.<br />The new one works good but makes more noise than I was hoping for. Also, the pigtail that it plugs into doesn't click into the motor. It slides in perfect, but doesn't make the audible &#34;click&#34;. So it slides out easy. If it comes out if I hit a hard bump. I might have to do something about that.
B0067UC5JG|5|it fit just right thanks
B005C2AS1W|5|Really like these straps.  Heavy duty and easy to use.
B000BUTD9S|1|The wrap around step rugs were fine but we ordered them in gray and got four different shades of gray and black. Not happy with that but will have to do.
B00OQP5ZL4|5|Nice
B00TUNSOMO|4|303 is a great product; there are a lot of products on the market you can use to wax a vehicle but they do not all clean as well as leave a beautiful protective shine.  With 303 no more water spots. This product is made in the USA. That’s important to me. Quick Wax is made for you boat but we used it on our car and mototcycle it did a great job on both. Just spray it on and wipe it off for a nice shine. Other attributes of 303 is the type of wax it is made of, Carnauba Wax offering a smooth hard protective finish. Also 303 does not contain silicone. I was perusing the other reviews concerning alternate uses for 303 and fully intend to try using it on my tub and shower as well as the countertops
B00L2N4B36|5|Looks great. Will buy from this vendor again.
B000C954AU|3|It works at what it does. As a safari owner that goes thru a cap and rotor fairly often... (Those of you who own a safari/astro van know what I mean). This cap and rotor lasted about a month before I got the usual P300 trouble code.
B0030GF2NQ|5|Great !
B00UVTMRI8|5|It's just what I wanted and easy to apply.
B0010DN9OU|2|wrong part waited to long to ship back good price
B0088PZVEE|5|Good price, fast shipping. recommended
B00EZ6VMKM|5|I needed folding side mirrors for my Ducati Scrambler 2015 so that I could adjust the angle of each mirror so that it doesn't hit the side mirrors of other vehicles as I filter through traffic.  The 280mm length is just right.  I had a similar setup in my KTM 990 SMT and I loved the folding mirrors.<br /><br />Installation was easy.  The kit came with mounting bolts.  The left side uses a mounting bolt that tightens clockwise.  The right side mirror mounting bolt turns counter clockwise to tighten.
B001OMVCIC|5|This has made towing my 26' camper w my 1/2 ton such a better experience. Without the airbags, even with my 10,000# weight bars, the rear end was pretty slammed. It was within spec, my trailer is proably 7000# loaded, but you felt every bump right up your back.<br />Added in the airbags and what a world of diffrence. I'm only getting around 5/8 squat in the back now. The suspension is still certainly compressed,  you know your towing,  but it now rides much more comfortable and controlled. Couldn't imagine towing a big trailer without these w a 1/2 ton.
B0007YGZ94|5|great product
B004T7Y5EW|5|Kind of tough to put on but they look great
B00MVHCEY0|5|Worked perfectly!
B00D3V2IKI|5|absolutely love it
B006BDVI5Q|5|Once cut, it worked great.
B007S191I6|2|Not as describe
B00ZV0X46G|4|Good quality. Vibrant colors.
B00N2BYTHO|5|Got these for 2010 Nissan Sentra - tired of the factory hubcaps These look great especially on my black Sentra. Good quality, tough, easy to fix and sturdy on the wheel.<br />Incident: I hit a low curb too hard while making a left turn and left-front hubcap came off (amazed it didn't break). I lost the tension ring on the street, called cust. care and asked for replacement ring (to buy one) and they sent one set of hubcap+ring promptly for free. All 4 look great together...Happy!!
B00D42AFS8|5|Borrowed a coworkers after a nightmare morning because my car wouldn't start. Hooked this little guy up, started immediately!<br /><br />(I don't know how long he has had it or how many times they have used it..)
B005N6YNPE|5|Far good enough even though on the Internet it nearly looks like if the Shirts were 3D!
B00FQ0ROZS|3|Brackets are too thin and bend easy but other than that they are very bright and I love them
B002UC19T2|3|Amazon!  Why are these now almost $42 when I just bought one 2 months ago here for $29.  These are rated for 11,000 gallons but are only lasting us around 600.  We are living in our 5th wheel while building a house and are on county water.  I have a chlorine allergy that causes me to break out into hives, and these last about a month, came back to reorder one but the cost has went up significantly???  I can tell when they go bad because I start to break out into hives again and according to our water bill, we are getting an average of 500-600 gallons per filter.
B00KWLLG6O|4|Heavy duty compared to stock kit sprockets. Good investment.
B000RXNLK6|5|It did the job.
B00KFMHAH4|5|Fits like a glove.
B001J8OXL4|5|PM makes great products. Had these on my Street Glide and just put a set both front & back on a '15 Street Bob w/fwd controls
B0018PW15I|5|Great
B004RFKBEO|4|We purchased this hoping that it would be easier to move our bikes around than the on the car carrier we had before.  This works as I expected.  The one con I would say for this is the weight, it is heavy.  But we took it on a long trip from IN to northwest WI and it worked well.  One comment we use two tie downs to assure that the bikes doe not move around too much, only one comes with the carrier.
B002PMOM5A|4|Everything fit fine
B00HQQQZ0K|5|Bought this set of bulbs recently, and they are fantastic. Bright white 6000K color, all of them work, plug and play. Although i bought a 9 pieces kit back in the time, they are willing to send me 2 more pieces at no cost for that. Customer service get back to me within 24 hours, which is also very nice. I recommend them.
B00XV4ZSUE|5|I am a 6 foot 3 inch tall man, skinny, and i love this jacket. It actually looks really great, it's the perfect length, both in the arms and the torso (I went with the large to fit my arms and long torso, instead of the normal medium) It's a little big in the belly area, but everything else fits awesomely. Even better, it's adjustable to look like it fits! Down by the waist of it, it can come it and it looks really good. The arms can get a little bit smaller too, and the ventilation is awesome! The armor inside makes it feel extremely safe, and altogether it feels very well made. Worth every penny! Looks great!
B00P057UIA|1|Cheap ABS plastic; nothing else - what A RIP!.
B000J3ZTEK|5|Awesome, fits my 2007 Honda Accord perfectly.  Really helps to keep the car cooler and the steering wheel does not burn my hands in the Florida sun anymore!!  I would by this product again!!
B00SLKWQGW|4|didnt fit my jeep
B00B2AFLEC|4|Shipped on time but wrong track bar was in kit. Rough country sent me a new kit. Thx RC.
B004JKD00O|2|Worked ok for a few commutes, but then the squeal is back. It really reduces braking power, and eats up the pads.
B004I5O6QW|5|great item A++++
B00KVWQJM0|5|Thought got the white ones but of course I didn't read the description. They work flawlessly. Snug fit. Now I can see the time on my Honda Accord.
B00GZLR754|4|Wish it had listed the model number: example this is ideal 3. I need model 4
B000YE8JYG|1|This item do not fit a 2005 Dodge 2.7L Engine front Crankshaft, Seal. This item inside diameter is to large for the shaft.
B00E0CZK8Q|5|Fits my Honda rubicon great including the rear drop basket.  Waterproof.
B003G0S9OA|5|Great product! Definitely glad I purchased! I have two little ones and it definitely protects the carpet and fits my Pilot perfectly. Received fast! Thanks!!!
B000C33D7W|5|great for wedding cookies--a good size
B00XZ9N2F8|1|Followed instructions tried numerous times even replaced battery.  Did not work
B001B9E4MY|5|Great product
B007YVOJZK|5|Derge!!! I love Dodge!! It was actually pretty thick and good quality. When it wears out (which will take awhile) I will buy another
B00PTFL8RU|3|I had my key cut and programmed.  The ignition key worked but the remote start didn't work..
B00PKU4U0G|5|Really compliment the LED 7&#34; head light.  Don't ride another mile in the dark without these.
B0002KKIVO|5|works good
B008I7RAYQ|2|I ordered this side mirror to replace the passenger side mirror that I &#34;accidentally&#34; destroyed on my 06 Maxima SL. The product arrived early in a hassle free container. First impression, the mirror looks the same but is mostly made of plastic. My car is black so the color matched almost perfectly. The product description noted that this was a powered mirror with manual fold so I was well aware that would be losing my power folding, heating, etc. Installation was easy so long as you have a 10mm wrench adapter and a screw driver (plenty of videos online to aid in installation). The only complaint I have, and it is a major one, is that the connector to power the side mirror was NOT a match. This was highly disappointing because now all I can do is move the mirror manually.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Overall appearance is a match<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Connector to power mirror is NOT a match so your powered options will NOT work<br />- plastic build<br />- easily damaged<br />- manual folding<br />- manual positioning of mirror<br /><br />Overall, I cant complain too much because I was too cheap to buy the OEM model but I at least would have expected it to have the right connector to power the mirror. If you dont mind buying a non powered mirror replacement, then go ahead and buy this mirror, otherwise, continue your search for a replacement.
B007BKG1X2|5|Worked perfectly and was at my house quickly!
B008FZNV2G|5|Fit perfectly for my 2012 328i, installed at dealer for $50. love them.
B00PY2IXNA|1|Cheaply made, inconsistent colors,  half didn't work no matter what I tried...
B005OXVO5S|3|There are actually four Acuator's on my 2009 Chevy Impala LT1. The first to go out was the one that determined where the air flow came from (Floor, Face, Defrost), the second to go out was the one that controlled the recirculate or intake air and the third was the passenger temperature one, I am waiting on the drivers side temperature one to go next. I have paid to have two replaced and they were not to bad around $250 each, but the temperature ones requiring removing of the dash board so the expense is now $700+ so I am wanting to replace the driver and passenger at the same time. This will save on labor. Since almost every single person I know who has a 2007 - 2010 Impala has had this problem, GM should have to fix them and reimburse us for the expense we incurred. Other than this, I love my Impala and the Service Air Bag light when has been on three different times since I purchased the car brand new.
B00AM0ULSE|4|Very happy with product.  I did have  to  file  the ends to fit, but it does what it's supposed  to  do.
B0050C5NPU|5|very nice replacement cover!
B000CSSR9G|5|THIS IS THE SECOND COVER I BUY FROM THIS VENDER.. THE FIRST COVER WAS POORLY MADE ... THE PLASTIC RINGS ON SIDES FOR SECURING COVER FELL OFF EASILY.. THE SECOND COVER WAS MADE MUCH BETTER I DO RECOMMEND THIS COVER.. ITS VERY STURDY AND WELL MADE
B00QHZV7IQ|4|Works well most of the time-would not connect a couple of times but restarted my phone and then connected<br />Biggest complaint is that you can not mirror image the view so if you are using it to backup and have it on your dash you are seeing a reverse image
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works fine for me.  I have one in my 2002 Ford Focus and another one in my 2010 Chrysler Town and Country.  Using the Torque app for Android, I can read a lot of realtime data and check/reset trouble codes from my phone.
B00EFBYSLM|3|Didn't like had a hole in one of them
B005CLQ3RQ|5|An exact replacement.  It took me only about 15-20 minutes to replace the broken handle.  FYI - you must remove the key lock from the old handle and put into the new handle.  This only involves removing one clip that holds in in place.
B00KTIZLZC|5|Device arrived when promised.  It seems to be a perfect match for the factory fob (other than the color obviously).  Programming was very simple and the fob works perfectly.
B002SA0WSK|2|Fit perfect. They wore out way too fast!
B00MOE9IRG|2|Does not fit the Yamaha rhino 660 UTV. The fuel connections are to small
B00UB39ISQ|1|it's suppose to read get in sit down shut up and hold on, not get it, what are you getting? I guess it's my fault I let that one slip by me, I am so use to the original phrase that I looked right over the word it...., I've never heard it phrased that way before. MY BAD! wasted money.
B00099C9QU|5|Great paint, love the color. The fan head sprayer is great for getting an even coat. This is my favorite color, but several colors in this line have been used in my projects over the years. For great results allow this to dry and spray a clear enamel over to enhance the shine and color (ACE Hardware aerosol spray cans work the best and won't yellow).
B001FEZ9U6|5|Great Air Intake kit.  Watch a video on how to put it on and be just a little gentle with the 3 screws that hold the unit onto the throttle body.<br /><br />Sounds great, trucks running good. I definitely recommend. (2003 Chevy S10 crew cab)
B00865EC3W|1|2 good and 2 don't hold air.
B00U435NTG|5|thank you, very nice stickers for my skeeter boat, I will probably purchase more
B00XTM9WKA|1|They do not fit my 2008 Subaru tribeca ltd as described. They are too big. Not for my model subaru.
B00P2D415K|5|These bulbs are a very high quality product, because tail lights and brake lights are more visible than with standard incandescence bulbs
B000C30IZM|3|I ordered GoodYear and got Continental without any explanation.
B008WY65PK|4|Star are coming off. Would choose another design from seller.
B0081PAN80|1|Purchased for a 2003 Ford Focus 2.0L Zetec engine. All signs pointed to a bad ignition coil pack. Installed and car ran much better for about 100 miles, then it got worse. Replaced this again with a different (and more costly) brand and fixed the problem - car runs like a champ again. Sorry, but the quality built into this item just isn't there, so caveat emptor. Remember, you get what you pay for.
B004KK553I|5|Good value, lasts thru carwashes.  Hasn't gone thru an Indiana winter yet. True to pic.
B0007WLPA0|5|Very well constructed and went on in just a couple of minutes.  Installed on my 2015 Ram Express.  Looks great and love it.
B000SL4A84|3|There's no bacitracin or neosporin/antibacterial ointment..
B009HL68N6|5|fits my car 2005 volvo s40 perfect, only hope it does not give way anytime soon
B010EYQ60E|5|My wife and I are Democrats, and we are voting for Trump
B001D8TGJE|5|Very light and strong, love the on/off valve built into the handle. I actually didn't even know this was built to attach to a hose, unexpected bonus.
B0027IXEA6|5|Great Product
B001Q7X05I|5|Really makes chrome stacks shine!
B009KA4FMU|2|I like this key chain, however I would of liked it even more if it was a little bigger. I had to change the ring as it kept getting stuck. Sturdy and cute.  Update broke within 6 months:/
B0024E6ZRW|3|You really need two of these, one on each end of the bottom stair, and should be sold as a set.  With one in the center of the bottom stair, the step becomes unstable and I'm sure that with frequent use would torque the step, and neither of us are more than 150 lbs.  With a pair, it seems like it would work very well to stabilize the step, but singly it seems more of a hazard.
B000OB1BE4|5|Installed on a 2006 F350. Easy installation and fit perfectly. My trucks performance has been greatly enhanced by the increased air flow.
B000O02734|5|Perfect fit. The only issue was that the electrical connector was too short but it's an easy fix to splice the old longer cable onto it. Youtube had a great video showing how to install.
B00EVVHT6W|5|perfect fit
B00BTLEIIY|5|a little hard to put on the rear seat of a 2013 Ford Focus S. Feel weird if you are shirt less. But still really nice for the proce
B007TG7HVS|5|nice
B001RKH7FS|3|Works great, but I've had troubles with the electrical connections.  First, I broke a cable when I pressed the device against the car dash.  OK, replacement cables are cheap - I bought three.  Then, a year later, I stick the cable in while loading up the car for a trip, and the female power connector built into the device shatters and disappears inside, rendering it useless!  I expect to disassemble this, switch to a different kind of connector, and be back in business.  But I feel like a sad panda right now.
B00GSSZ4F4|5|Great sticker!!  Very well made.
B000WJAH5M|5|These kept my hands from going numb and felt a lot better than the OE grips on my Royal Star Venture. Easy install and recommend over replacing the whole grip.
B005UTS6FC|5|Just as I expected  :)
B00802FXVG|5|Product works great installed in about 45 minutes. I've had no issues yet had them in my car for about 3 weeks. Very happy with how good they work
B008QDDGOA|5|It fit and that's all that matters
B00KWEW1K6|5|Works great
B00EI6CKVE|5|Saw this on a car and HAD to get it for my daughter who prepares fossils and is a paleoartist. She goes on dinosaur digs and drives a Jeep. Loved it, loved it, loved it.
B00367KGAI|4|A little smaller than I had expected. But looks nice and it is a nice addition to my keychain. Good buy!
B00A1C627C|5|Beautiful!!!!
B008032QBA|5|good
B005NLQAHS|4|Works great with free apps from the Play Store.
B004D2XAMG|1|I purchased a set of these from a Putco dealer, was told these have a good warranty against defects. A month after I installed my FIRST pair, I noticed an odd smell, similar to a hot circuit board while sitting in traffic. Because I was in the middle of rush hour I didn't give it a second thought until three blocks later I was pulled over for a tail light out. The officer was very pollite and gave me just a verbal warning. Thankfully I was only a mole or so from the dealer where I bought them, swung in and pulled the bulb out and sure enough the circuit board was burnt, so burnt it had melted the plastic down into the aluminum &#34;heatsink&#34; ring. The dealer said it was covered under the warranty offered by Putco and he would get me another pair, downside was I had to swap out the clear taillights until they arrived. Fast forward two months.... ..... ..... .... I got a call to let me know they had come in, no cost to me and was deemed workmanship defective. Brought an home, swapped out the taillights and drove on. Yesterday, which has been approximately two months since replacement I was leaving work waiting for the stop light when I noticed that eeriesmell again, before I could be pulled over I turned into the closest gas station to check it out, opening the trunk to pull back the carpet was scary, I had to use a rag to remove the bulbs as the aluminum &#34;heatsink&#34; was so hot I sizzles my fingers. Not wanting my lamp to melt I pulled it out as quick as possible and saw a fmiliar sight of burnt circuit board and melted plastic. I think the third time will NOT be a charm. I plan to go to my dealer and ask about refund or a different version of these bulbs due to the dangerous conditions they cause, I recommend everyone to stay far away from any of these Neutron bulbs.
B000C2E6QK|5|Fit  perfectly. Because it has a graphite coating it will come off easy if necessary in the future.
B008XKPWWK|4|Great fixture for my tv for rv . Very heavy duty. If I find one falt it would be hanging TV to bracket there is no clip or slide to help you when installing TV to bracket . You have to be  creative like me or have someone hold it while you start the screws .
B00NCA1O7S|1|Don't Buy!! Total Ripoff!! These are not made of plastic but paper. They are nothing but stickers for 10.00!? Are you kidding me? I just got ripped off and I want a refund.
B004FGY6HI|5|bought these without knowing what the heck they were, was just told to find something that could go on our atv and would hold some guns... Hey... I did good... they work wonderfully!
B000FF6VJ4|5|REALLY DOES THE JOB WELL
B004B2GL6U|3|It's the right part and it works, for now.  The quality is clearly inferior to the original.  I had to bend the lever that controls the key locking mechanism several times to get it to line up so that it would lock and unlock.
B005530YSA|5|Fast Shipping, Quality OEM Part
B003VAUMX6|1|Plastic garbage
B00VH8VDJG|5|Looks great
B00N34IVZ6|5|Exactly what I needed, fast delivery
B007K8AA7I|3|The light is quiet a bit brighter that the stock head light but I don't like the light pattern it puts out There is some dark spots in a curve on low beam<br />High beam is better.
B00G6KGPFM|5|Perfect for lapping seams on my rv.
B00S4HHVLW|5|Rugged, durable, easy to install
B00E58KYHM|5|Worked perfectly.  Once installeranged on a 2003 Cadillac, I had to disconnect the battery and reconnect it so the unit would reset its operating range.
B005F1YJ3I|5|Works very well. LED lights work,
B000VU8YO8|4|worked well for the application  its nice and thick
B000H94F6E|5|Schumacher makes the best battery chargers period!
B004ZF39ZY|4|The lights themselves are good except there is no adapter to plug them in.
B000BWEH06|5|Neat
B004F8Y0MW|4|I wish I could have gotten ones without painted on logo's but they were easy enough to remove.
B000BZ71L0|4|Parts were of high  Quality
B005R6R6DG|5|Great
B003XKK7ES|3|It's cute, but it was too big and came down too far so I was unable to unlock the door with it on.
B00FY7M38Q|1|Twice Twice....I ordered cheetah and received zebra black and white
B00BC3727S|5|This helmet does make YOU look badass! I feel like one of the &#34; SONS &#34; hahaha. It doesn't offer a lot of protection but for cruising in the city at 20-40mph its ideal. I would NOT recommend highway use. I would look at a fully modular helmet or a full faced helmet from bell. The XL fit me perfectly! This helmet again makes you look badass! I got it for the looks pretty much. The seller was awesome sending this to me with 2 day service shipping and came in a clothed bag not ONE scratch on it.
B005KVLX50|3|The price was amazing,  the hitch bed extender arrived promptly, and the materials seem rugged but the quality control was disappointing.  There was no instruction manual in the box although the sticker on the unit clearly states the importance of keeping the manual with the unit to insure proper and safe use.  There are 4 bolts threaded into the extender bar - one of those was not threaded all the way through so the bolt would not tighten down on the lock washer.  I was unable to tap the hole deeper but adding a second thick flat washer allowed the bolt to tighten against the lock washer.  Also, a clip is supposed to pass through the extender to join the two halves - the hole on one side was egg shaped as though drilled twice but there was no corresponding hole on the other side.  I drilled through so the pin could be fitted properly.  Once these modifications were done the unit went together easily and functioned well although the parts fit very loosely as other reviewers have noted.
B001GRN6LG|5|Perfect fit
B00B2AFHZK|5|Awesome
B0006IX7ZG|5|As expected
B00G7N5AD6|5|The look on my wife's face when she opened this says it all: this is really cute and sure to make any Hello Kitty fan happy!
B001UCEUZI|4|Gets the job done reliably. I do wish for a little less pedal effort for urgent stops, but the price is right and the ceramic should make for less fade and better service life.
B0049Z2WMQ|5|Gaskets worked great on my 99 Silverado 1500 pickup.  Solved my leak issue and check engine light gone
B004IJDOI4|2|Parts fit and are ok. But after a year of being inside a car, they are starting to rust. Better to buy SS bolts at local hardware store.<br />Just my .2 cents
B00KV6WB3W|1|I order this set, and only got one! I guess if you want 2 you have to order 2 even though it shows 2 in the photo. I complained and they mailed me another one. They worked for about a week and no longer light up.
B0009N0W60|5|Product as described and fast delivery.  Nice look on the Bike.
B006EGAIJ2|5|i love it...as expected
B008BQNYTE|5|This looks feels fairly sturdy. Wasn't sure it would with my kayak but exactly what I wanted. I sure if someone came in with big bolt cutter they could steal but this offers protection against opportunistic theft. I'll also use it on my kayak rack when traveling.  Pretty flexible.
B009YRI64C|5|I think she like it im not sure if she put it on her car yet but anything zombie related she likes therefore i like
B00MYX04GG|5|Perfect lights looks great works great
B000IY6S4K|5|Nice replacement part, very happy.
B00D2LPO7I|1|Did not fit
B009UI33OI|5|No surprises ! Comes with a little tale of the gremlin bell and a bag.
B005F9L52I|5|I uses genuine Mopar after learning the hard way that the cheap aftermarket TPS units are garbage. The don't work right all the time, they don't last long, and a &#34;lifetime guarantee&#34; from the local auto parts store will do me no good when I'm broke down on the side of the road. This fixed all the idling and drive issues on my 2003 Dakota.
B00938SGR4|5|xenon lights are great, halos pretty much suck except at night for &#34;bling &#34; factor. the switch is kinda cheap but effective. all in all good for price
B00G620ZVU|5|Great Lights at a great price. Mounted these on the front corners of my TJ jeep bumper. These things are bright. RTV silicone around them and you're set!
B00AFGPLIA|5|Speedy delivery and came with a GrimmSpeed sticker. Great packaging and can't wait to put on my car
B00I96JZU8|5|Arrived quickly, and was fully charged as advertised. Too soon to give full review on durability and performance, but will update with another review when sufficient time has passed.
B00238EVAM|3|great but after a few ride it broke in two pieces just on top of my nose
B0039P2NK8|5|Good Product.  Only complaint I have is the instructions.  They were jumbled up with the JK and the older models.  Had to pick through exactly what applied to me.  Also the black and white pictures were very fuzzy.  I got more info by searching for YouTube videos.  Also, here's a trick I learned:  After you get them installed and lined up, they will be very sturdy and easy to open and close.  When you get ready to take them off, leave the latch in place and loosen the 4 Allen head screws at the hinges and remove that way.  It will get everythign unbound so it will come off without a hammer.  I learned that on the second door.  All in all, a very good deal and a great product.
B00WH1XUKC|5|works great
B0039XQ5DG|5|I love it I Am Very Happy thank you.
B00D044OIM|5|Easy install looks pro...It's an OEM part and perfect.  I like how you pull off the tape for the 3m sticky side but all the letters are held perfect by clear tape on the other...you just have to make sure it's level and straight and you're good to go.
B000CPI5Z0|3|Works, but didn't notice a difference over a cheaper product.
B0051XBNDY|5|I used this to retain my factory oem backup camera.  This made it so easy.  You just plug in the proprietary A/V cable from the camera to the CHYRVD and then the RCA plug from CHYRVD to your aftermarket head unit or monitor.<br /><br />Great job PAC!  This was exactly what I was looking for.
B00NFFEJOA|5|Love it match with my wheels
B00KDDALKS|5|solid button, satisfying click
B001DBBTO6|5|It's ok
B00L0R5ZQQ|4|Nice and bright but not water proof.
B00DI3DV6G|5|Great organizer.
B0031XDLFY|5|OEM Part. Work as should
B00UB3A0N8|5|FOR MY PASTOR WHO SAW THIS ON A SHIRT AND TOLD ME THAT HE WANTED TO RIP IT OFF THE GUY FOR HIMSELF.  SO I BOUGHT HIM THE CAR STICKER.
B000CSGWZM|5|The difference in spark plugs might be psychological but both my Suzuki DRZ400 and Yamaha WR250R seemed to have a bit more power and run better when I put in the Iridium plugs.  Anyway it took me an hour to remove the seat, covers, and tank, replace the plug, and reinstall everything on my WR250R so I want to put in the best plug possible and not worry about it for another 10,000 miles or so.
B0013HP98C|5|works great and looks good on car.
B007B856YY|5|i love it...as expected
B009PAK75E|3|Said that they were for an 05 blazer bu there is no slot for your seat belt don't like that so if your a person likes to drive with your seat belt on don't get this set
B007KDLQY4|5|Awesome quality
B00MUF1APW|5|I use these as backup lights in a 2007 Tahoe. Very bright and helps me see out of the tinted windows. I highly recommend. They do only plug in one way, so if they don't turn on, take them out and flip them around.
B008G2XOUM|5|It was fast and they are great thank I will be back
B00EZYLIM6|5|Very nice, easy install, great price. The bolt holes won't match up, but so what. It comes with new screws and a rubber gasket. Great quick mod.
B00BVEI8ZS|5|Come in on time just as it said. product was as described I'm happy with it
B00B8XI62C|5|It looks great on my phone! :) ♡☆ &#60;3
B0030MEJFC|1|Wont permanently bond two surfaces. I can easily pull the plastic from the foam I am trying to glue from 60 seconds after to a week after drying. The only thing this product does well is make a mess. Seller sent me another after complaining about the first. It wasnt a defect. The product just doesn't work as advertised.
B00F8I5WW0|4|very good
B000VBAAPI|4|I gave it 4 stars because for the price I would expect to cover more area but still satisfied compared to the individuals I had before 07 F 150 crew cab
B00ANQ5RVS|4|excellent product
B004VTJCGE|5|Totally love these lights. One came scuffed up, but instead of returning them I was able to sand and polish it back into good shape. There is one little mark, but you have to look at in the right way in the right kind of light. Changed the look for the better. I hated the stock tail lights. I had to watch a video on how to install them because I could not figure out how to install the connector from the new light to the old wiring. The instructions that came with looked like a copy of a copy of a copy. You could read them, barely. The pictures were just black smears. Had to pull out the old light bulb and just push in the new connector. Once you pull out the old bulb it will make sense. The whole thing then plugs back in just like the stock lights. I plan on getting LED's for the stock bulb that got used over for the turn signal. There is some good new and bad news. First the bad news, there is no hook up for the back up lights. Good news is that I am going to hook into the old wires and install some LED floods under the bumper.  The turn signal is the upper clear part(you might want to get an amber colored bulb), the middle is the brake light. The lower round ones are just reflectors.
B00T3TK3EW|1|Too weak to lower temps. My temps &#34;rise&#34; 2 degrees when I have the fan on. Going to be taking it out today. Blame myself for spending $30 on a fan.
B0001EFSTI|4|Good product.
B000BUU5XQ|1|These are very small. Might work for a popup trailer but not for a large trailer. I will be returning them. I was very disappointed.
B00J00X3NW|5|Excellent product.
B00MEZV64I|4|Worked fine.
B0002UHVAA|5|This excels at cleaning out all aspects of line and tank.
B00FWP8QBS|4|The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it did not fit on right front wheel where cap was missing, but did fit on right rear wheel.  Simply put the right rear cap on the right front.  Not a problem and happy with the result.<br /><br />L
B0041CGAVQ|5|Awesome sound and performance
B000CB7GAY|1|Rides like s***
B00FRHOLK6|5|Love them, would not go back to 'regular' blades.
B000EDOT8C|5|I really like this, I'm using this at home on my regular size stove - It does not completely cover the top as it is made for an RV size. That being said, it does almost completely cover the burner areas and it does provide extra counter space and the flat flexible cutting is so easy to work with and clean up is a breeze!<br />We do need to seal the wood board as directed to protect it for years to come. Let me not forget to say that It is well made.
B00BN5XV0M|5|Great budget full helmet, with decent styling and features. Comfortable to wear for a few hours without any problems.
B001EOWR3Y|5|This device works perfectly.  I use it with my Curt 2 inch to 1 1/4 inch adapter for my bike rack.  It takes the wobbling away completely.  Plus, it's only $12.  Highly recommended.  Engineered to perfection.
B0094W7QDY|1|Garbage! failed after 800 miles, 5 months and left me stranded..
B000Z0HVHA|1|Damn thing didn't work at all.
B001UA2A2K|5|It's great fits snug and I ordered a size up glad I did I would suggest that to anyone else buying it. The pic makes its gaudy lookin but it is actually very small padding not the best for bikers goin 60 mph but great for cosplay or those bmx or street riding bikes and trail bikes.
B001MT9QZS|5|Just Fab!
B001445T2K|5|easy to install
B003NZBHGK|5|My boyfriend loves this helmet. Uses it everyday. Ships a little slow, but worth the money!
B000C6KK8O|4|Very nice air filter and it fit my car exactly.  Purolator makes some very nice products, especially their top-rated PureOne oil filters.  This air filter is of similar quality.
B00B301V36|3|Good quality and price was right.
B0036V1LD0|5|Floor mats nothing to get overly excited over, saw people complain about the BMW logo only on the Driver Side, everyone knows you drive a Beamer sort of a silly complaint!  Look and fit perfect and were 20 buck less them the dealers!
B000VKPS5G|5|A++
B00SZZKU02|5|GOOFIT Outlet Vacuum Fuel Pump Assembly is a great product and since I fitted it into my Gy6 50cc 139qmb Chinese Racing Scooter its performance has improved remarkably. This product is worth buying as you would experience a better efficiency for your Chinese racing scooter once you fit in this product into it.
B003FXNCQS|5|As expected, great. Thank you
B00ASY5OZE|5|Have used them before and will continue , excellent service and decent prices
B00TE1QGPO|5|Exact fit, easy to install and work great.
B00S8QB73M|5|Looks amazing on my boyfriend's vehicle. The packet includes very detailed instructions, which allows for easy installation. Absolutely love it!
B0010E00T6|5|Screw you Honda!  $200 to change?  Really?
B0002SA0AK|4|Great top for the price.  It could be easily improved by running a strap across the width, side to side.
B00SZ70TP6|4|Looks great on a 2015 silver Silverado pickup
B00KWETZS2|5|Perfect fit for 2013 CX5 Mazda.
B0002RNSIC|2|I'm sure this product works fine when the pigtail is on the Xterra but just a FYI this will not fit a manual transmission Xterra it says it fits but it does not. Nissan made the manual and automatic with different wiring harness's.
B000BUTD9S|5|Now that I installed these, the dog finally will use the steps!!  Fit well and arrived as advertised.
B002X1JWTY|3|they work for what I needed
B00F6B9I5G|1|It simply does not fit. The mounting layout on the back is completely incompatible with the layout on the original that I removed. Luckily I didn't have to break the glass even more on the factory mirror, because I had to reinstall it. 2009 chevy aveo5.
B001CQWM8E|5|Very happy with the rearview mirror to get to Pizmo beach for three days on the sand really rough never budged very well-built sticks out of the rail about half an inch on top so if you have a hard top roof might be a pain I have a canvas topso it fit perfect
B007OSL3DY|5|Perfect
B00SGFZCTA|5|Not very heavy, looks fancy. Best for the price for the value I'd say
B00QQYXI1C|3|These locks seem more substantial than the plastic locks on my old trailer.  I would give them 5 stars except:<br /><br />1) no template or directions for mounting them in a door.  This may be ok for those of you who are replacing an existing lock, but I put these into a cargo trailer and without directions or a template the process took much longer (trial and error) than necessary.<br /><br />2) the screws to hold the lock together are too short - maybe 2 turns before they tighten.<br /><br />3) the key is really cheap and I would not say the lock is not very secure.  The only comfort on this score is that the deadbolt is so hard to turn that someone trying to pick the lock would have trouble turning it.<br /><br />4) the deadbolt is very hard to deploy - I loosened things to check to see if it was binding and it was not binding, just tight.<br /><br />Other than that, I am very happy to have this type of lock on my cargo trailer so I can use it as a camper from time to time.
B004H2KOS0|4|The cup holder sits firmly attached to my handlebars and holds just about any size drink.  Functionality seems to be good, but will have to see over the long run.  The foam liner is a bit cheap and cheesy so much so that I'll be buying a different plain black one elsewhere.  I may just be particular, but I prefer the clean, plain look over the goofy, cartoon figures on this liner.
B00NB8LFPM|5|Perfect fit and price.
B000IOHEP2|5|Arrived on time, these are the 3rd set of Big Shots l have purchased l love the look great, sound great and enhance the bike. love them. Peter C.
B00PC0G07A|5|Revised review : after checking multiple similar products. This one seems the best deal, the leather quality is very good compared to others and price is less.  The trick for best installation is to make sure it fits your steering and to stitch it properly and firmly..  I used the baseball stitch using two needles at the same time so it took me around 6 hours to finish but the results are acceptable.  I will buy more of this product.
B00GMTX0S2|1|Beware of this item because the description isn't accurate. A close up look at the picture reveals the true identity of this item. Although the item is described as a 73mm 14 flute cap style filter wrench that is not what I received. I purchased this product based on the description. I was expecting a single purpose tool that would fully engage and make use of the flutes/flats on the oil filter. What showed up on my doorstep was a cap style oil filter wrench that fits 73 AND 72mm 14 flute oil filters. I sent the first one back and received a replacement that was exactly the same. It is stamped 903-4 and 73-72-14P  The material and construction seem good however the design leaves you wanting much more filter contact area and that's why I'm giving it one star. The 73mm portion is too shallow before the 72mm portion starts. What that does is limit how far you can push the tool onto a 73mm filter. I measured the contact area on the inside of the filter tool and came up with an actual contact area of about  6 mm...  .236 inch or just under 1/4 of an inch.  That can cause trouble with a 73mm filter that was over torqued when installed because it will only get more difficult to remove as time goes forward.   Measuring the 72mm portion there is roughly 9 mm worth of contact area.
B00480J4PU|4|Not that much whiter than regular bulbs, dont waste your money. Instead invest in HiDs like morimoto.
B0068ERO1A|2|zipper stuck on material of the left leg,not happy!
B00JRR769K|5|Wow! Matches the paint on my 2014 Dark Grey Metallic BRZ perfectly! Works well too; Haven't noticed any reception issues!
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Perfect for someone like me who needs a kleenex for just about anything in the car right at your fingertips, and the trash off the floor.
B0052FRSYO|4|My only complaint of this exterior door handle is that the threading was metal and not plastic like the original part. I had to find totally different bolts for the door handle.
B005FNKSMW|4|this works great and for $63 for the battery and charger you cant go wrong..
B000BM3B3A|3|This aerosol duster to remove lint around keyboard keys and from the computer air vents at the back of the monitor was about a one time use.  Product itself is fine and was able to adequately remove the dust that collected around my keyboard keys.  However, it is insufficient to clean an entire computer system.  Just not enough air in it.  For the price, it is not worth the money.
B004FSEJZA|3|Well I ordered this believing it was the original was. What I got was a updated style. Not the same can as shown. It seems to work well but definitely not what's pictured. Not even the same smell.<br />Works okay but wouldn't have ordered if i had known it wouldnt be the original honda cleaner.
B00CSY1UMS|3|I purchased this to go with the Sylvania SDVD1332 13.3&#34; Portable DVD Player (also from Amazon) because other reviews had mentioned it fit it perfectly, and I cannot say that I agree.  While you could position the velcro straps to keep it in place, it does not hold it very securely.  There are two mechanisms that are to be velcroed (is that a word?) together, and one of them does not line up properly with the more important, stabilizing ones are in place.  The material is a bit flimsy, but it did hold the player in place well enough for a 2000 mile road trip.  I also could not zip it up with the DVD player inside because it is too wide.  I imagine a smaller device would fit in it more appropriately, but I will be looking for something else to fit my larger 13.3&#34; screen DVD player a little better.
B004D9KU4U|3|Had a difficult time removing sticker from decal without it coming off the window.
B0066R9U5W|5|Great quality product and great service at a reasonable price
B00ED8SWGE|1|1 time use only.<br /><br />Both of the ones I ordered stripped the threads of the screw on the clamp while being removed. Totally useless.
B00T725JHG|5|Item arrived quickly and fits perfectly.
B00M3D7582|5|First impressions.. WoW, clean light, not extremely bright but surely exceeded expectations.. See photo of my car to feel the difference between the factory bulb on the left and the white on the right.
B002E5HMSC|5|Very good + Fast shipping./-
B00MB0E1WK|2|This frays really bad.  Not long lasting or durable at all.  It is pretty when it is new though.
B001DAEEYY|5|Great price for their value. Parts were as described and was delivered on time with Prime.
B00826OVWW|5|Good product. Easy to install
B00G4UP9N8|5|Plug and play...again!!
B004L5H9EK|1|Mat looks nothing like this. Doesn't fit. Will return.
B0067UG09W|4|What a pain in the butt to install.  Wow.  The bolt that goes into the center post was rusted and had to be drill out - but once I got the old one off, the new one went on easy and now a new mount does its job.
B000ZRW78Q|5|arrived on time works like it should great product
B00OQTEL7E|5|This is a big, beefy set of forward controls.  They were easy to install, but the brake side mount took some trying to get into place.  Everything fit, and lined up like it was supposed to.  Everything seems to be very high quality.
B003X9XIE0|5|Great purchase, fits well and shows off the Huskers... Go Big Red!!
B00TO7NHBY|4|Good price.. should work ok ,
B00II5YD4S|1|It removes the water from my shower glass just fine but the screeching noise it makes is so loud and unbearable that I cannot recommend this product.  I have no way of knowing if another silicone product will do the same so I will stick with rubber for now.
B001O7PNXC|3|works great!  Just too much dust!
B0016LG0CY|1|Does not work...at all...
B000GKD722|5|Works well large amount could not find locally
B008MNOC92|1|Purchased a 2015 Town and Country with this product in place of spare tire.  It is a POS.  My wife ran over a nail, but the nail was not in tire.  The sealant ran out of the hole and did not inflate the tire.  The tire store advised this thing is only good for pin holes. The cheapest I have found for replacement sealant cartridge is $35.  Guess I'll keep the compressor and buy a can of Fix-A-Flat.<br /><br />Unless you drive through a garment district and might run over a straight pin of a safety pin,  don't waist your money on this product
B000NSIRRW|5|Great fun game in excellent condition. Happy with purchase.
B000QQ7SXA|1|it lasted less then one year, car had a lot of vibration and when  mechanic removed the flywheel, there was a big vertical play between two pieces of flywheel.
B000KK9M6S|5|worked great
B00937YLE2|4|For the price, they work good.  I believe these are 80/20 and made in China.  If you see 70/30  or 75/25 and made in Korea get them cause Korea makes them better.  But these are good for dirty cleaning meaning good all around cleaning.
B00QKTIA84|4|These headers came a day early. I was really excited to put them on. instillation took very little time but, as previous reviews have said, they don't fit exactly precise to the cat. this isn't a huge deal if you have another set of hardware laying around. I have a 92 eg sedan. it is SLAMMED to the ground. I do not --- let me repeat --- DO NOT recommend buying these headers if you're low to the ground. the first hour I had them on, the bottom is pretty much destroyed. That is the only I con I found because they hang a little lower than the stock headers. However, if you are running a muffler delete, this setup sounds very nice and doesn't sound ricey at all. it is a very nice deep sound and also adds 5-10mpg and feels like it also adds horsepower as well. enjoy.
B00L9HTM20|5|Just like the pictures!
B00B1FQHNC|2|Not good quality
B00HZMXRQA|5|Love flashpoint products, this one is no different.
B000B68V6I|5|Works as listed
B000C5I4DS|4|Lower than OEM mopar quality buy good enough
B00N2BYTHO|5|Very inexpensive and makes my car look better than the grey wheel covers that are standard. They are plastic but are shiny and sharp.
B0026CG5S6|4|They tend to arrive with small scratches where they touch each other in the package (not Amazon's fault). Since they were going on a truck, this isn't a big deal, but something to keep in mind if you are putting them on a pristine car. I took one of the other reviewers advice and left the clips out which did prevent auto-up issues. They fit well, look good, and work great. Definitely help keep the temperature down on hot days by leaving the windows cracked all day, and I don't have to worry about running back out to the truck during those afternoon summer thunderstorms.
B000CIU726|4|What's really to say.  It's a spark plug and it sparks.  Fits what it's supposed to and does the job.
B00CZ6ZPKC|5|I bought these because I wanted a headlight housing that had projector bulbs in them. I have a 95' f350 and these headlights were plug and play. They look very nice. I'd reccomend
B00Y5OBHXG|1|quality kooks and construction.
B00H9FFDH4|5|Good product, excellent service support.<br /><br />Any questions resolved, they solve any problem immediately.
B000C1LW0E|4|Pump works great however I purchased the WIX filter as an add-on item as suggested. The WIX filter is the wrong size for the fuel line. Don't purchase the WIX filter with this pump. It wont fit.
B000BO56P4|5|Fixed my John Deere.
B0009TAOG2|5|Fast shipping,good quality.just as advertised. Would purchase from this compNy again..
B000GU19BS|5|Arrived on time, well made, l have a 1999 fat boy which it was made to fit but its to long if it was 2inches shorter l would love it. Peter C.
B00J00X3NW|5|excellent oil. but when can i get my rebate？
B00Y5N3VTU|5|Perfect
B001PRR366|5|I bought mine at autozone over 5 years ago and still use to this day.  I have ,my garmin plugged into it  as well as my whelen dash light all the time.  Im finally in need to replace it as the center sockets dnt seem to want to work and i wanna mount my fuzz buster again.......definitely will be buying another one.
B00Z7KIZPA|1|got the from TV add...This pouch way toooooooo small for my purse...They advertised that a back pack could fit in the pouch,, they lied!  Very dissatisfied with this product
B003G54MOG|5|Howes 103067 Meaner Power Diesel Kleaner - 1... was (back in 2002) the only diesel fuel treatment endorsed my Cummins, I use it faithfully in my 2002 Dodge Ram 2500 diesel. I can only assume it's doing it's job as I have never had a problem with the fuel system of my truck! It's still the only brand I will use in my truck!
B008UYDRB2|5|Love the helmets, but shipping took forever
B00OLVGGZM|4|Fits well. Good and thick and will protect bed. Iems in the bed still move around but not as bad. Would recommend this iten.
B00NH92LOO|5|I like them, there made of metal but the only thing I don't like is that you have to peel off the back of Logo and put them on but I can see why they did it because of the screw going through the nut and then covering it up with the logo.Still worth the $$$
B005QD0Z9C|5|Nicer than I thought they would be
B007QBT1CY|1|Works.  Had to shim it to the small block.  I've not had to do that with remans.  Does not come with shims so made my own.  Failed after 18 months.  Amazon's commitment to the 24 month/24000 mile warranty is a joke.  The 3 representatives (so far) I've talked to are not aware of their own policy which I've provided:    Automotive Items If you have purchased an automotive item shipped from and sold by Amazon.com that is defective and is covered by a manufacturer’s published warranty, Amazon will either replace the item or refund the cost of the item for the life of the published warranty. Warranty & Support Warranty, Parts:24 Months / 24,000 Miles (Parts Only)  So far I've been asked for the same credit card I purchased it with 18months ago, been referred to AC DELCO's web site, and offered a partial refund.  Now I have been referred back to AC Delco after spending 1 1/2 hours conversing with reps and their managers.  So buy at your own risk.  This will be the LAST AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCT I EVER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON
B00REJXRS2|5|Great for groceries when the cab is full of kids.
B00ANZHG7C|5|These cloths are great!
B000CFME2A|5|Got the job done when the mower needed a replacement spark plug. Not sure what else you can say. It's a spark plug. It came in a box. It sparks....
B00SISDAD0|5|This is an amazing light bar for your money. I highly recommend this. I bought it and it arrived at my door in 3 days. Way faster than I expected. Don't go spend 200 or 300 dollars because this is a great light bar, and made of quality parts. I have washed my truck probably 2 or 3 times now with the light bar (it's on my bumper) and it still has not leaked or have any comdensation at all! Over all great bar for the money!
B00LHUI4XM|5|Fantastic frame.  Easy to put on, quality parts, looks really good too.
B00EDQ19EI|5|For those of you out there with Avalanches, Tahoes, Suburbans, Yukons, Denalis, and Escalades, don't consider anything but these ACDelco replacement shocks for your truck. I began looking at replacements on Amazon for my OE shocks last winter (2007 Avalanche LTZ, 140,000 miles) and at the time, these were more expensive, so I went with the Arnott AS-2708. They claim to completely tear down and rebuild returned cores so the GM sensor connectors still will work and retain the Z55 package abilities (I don't know why anybody would want to defeat or turn off that system... when everything is working properly, nothing beats it).<br /><br />The day after I installed the Arnotts, I noticed the right side of the truck was sagging. Called Arnott about a warranty issue, and they insisted that my compressor must be shot (it still would turn on and pump up my old shocks, they just wouldn't keep pressure over long periods). So, before I could replace my shocks, I ordered a replacement compressor. The new compressor charged the Arnotts quicker as it obviously had more strength than my old one. I figured I was set.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2,000 miles and 3 months later, both Arnott shocks have leaks and the new compressor can't even pump them to full strength. I was able to do it with a regular garage compressor by pulling the truck's airlines and inserting air directly into the shock. It seems to hold, then you drive it around the block (no load in the bed or being towed) and they come back deflated. The only thing that I can figure is that since Arnott does nothing to the actual shock on the returned OEM cores (something I realized when dealing with them when I first put them on, they are extremely shady about admitting that all they do is put new airbags on 150,000 mile shocks), there is a worn out shock with excess travel in it, that compresses the air bladder exponentially more than a new shock, and forces the air bladder to deflate much faster. You could also assume that since that air bladder constantly needs refilling, that it will tax your compressor more often as well. No wonder they suggest putting a new compressor in with these things.<br /><br />Long story short, avoid these Arnotts. Because they are returned cores, if you order two shocks, you might get one with 75,000 miles on the base hardware, while another could have 200,000 miles (explains why one side was so much worse than the other). I shelled out the cash to purchase the proper ACDelco NEW shocks, have them installed, and then return the Arnotts at my own expense. I'm also going to get smacked with a &#34;restocking fee&#34; taken out of my credit for the Arnotts. I would have made out better buying the more expensive ACDelcos in the first place. Fortunately for all of you reading this, the ACDelcos now cost the same money as the Arnotts. Don't make my mistake. The ACDelcos have performed brilliantly.
B0006PJJC4|5|good fuel can
B007VTQ9JE|4|It works ok. I paint goalie masks and trying to find something that stays put on the curves and contours of that nature with out bleeding by is really a challenge.
B0007XUZIC|4|Hitch works great. Step works even in the rain without slipping. The only issue is the hitch is not on there tight and has a lot of wiggle room. 1/2 gasket that sits between the male end and the felame end of the hitch would fix the issue.
B004NV6FE2|5|Thank you for your prompt delivery, the item works well.
B000BZJA4Q|5|Works just as needed. Perfect fit for my 2005 Nissan Titan 5.6L 4x4 Offroad
B005ETCIO8|5|Work great!
B005PUY2VS|4|Works as intended with LOTS of elbow grease! You may not have to use the grainer grit paper if your headlights are only mildly hazy. My car was 20 years old though so I went through all the sandpaper discs. Also, wear protective eyewear and a good mask - these are chemicals you do not want to breathe in.<br /><br />The end results look great, almost professional even. Very hard for an amateur to not scratch the paint surrounding the headlines so lift the hood and tape tape tape all the surrounding areas on the bumper and quarter panel!<br /><br />The missing part is the headlight sealer. Without a sealer, your headlights will fog up faster than the first time (since there was a sealer on them from the factory). The headlight sealer can be purchased on Amazon as well - invest in this and you won't ever have to clean your headlights again!
B002EWHRGC|5|Not only is the Uflex steering system a superior product, Uflex's customer service and support is outstanding.<br /><br />First, here's my experience with Uflex service:<br />I ordered the Protech 1.0 system and installed it in place of another system, and I used the existing hoses. After installing the system it was obvious that something was wrong. The wheel didn't turn as smoothly as it should have. I called Uflex about the issue and spoke with Ryan A. about my problem. Ryan knows his stuff, and he very nicely and patiently explained (although he didn't use these words) that the issue is probably my fault. The old hoses I used likely had some debris in them which probably stuck a piston in the newly installed Uflex helm. Truth be told -- I'm sure he was right because I neglected to flush the hoses before installing the new helm. A mistake I won't make in the future.<br /><br />Even though I likely caused the issue, he didn't give me any trouble about sending a replacement. I received the replacement in two days and I returned the original helm in the same box with a call tag they supplied. It'd be nice if all companies stood behind their product like this.<br /><br />Second, here's my experience with the Uflex hardware.<br />It's built like a tank, operates smoothly, and looks great. People often compare Uflex to other systems, but now that I have a Uflex system -- I see there is no comparison. It stands on its own. I hope they're getting a lot of new customers because it's pretty obvious I won't have to buy a new steering system any time soon.
B005G527HI|2|The so-called silver plate is cheap plastic, and I'm not sure the leather is really leather.

B00DIPSE6G|5|What can I say? This sticker is exactly what I wanted in an IR patch design sticker. Heavy duty material, superb adhesive, this will last for a long time. May your enemies flee in terror at it's very presence.
B00M9LW6UU|1|Color match was great, but application was a disaster. The &#34;marker pen&#34; does not feed the marking tip easily or consistently. In addition. the tip is very hard, does not hold the paint, and is very difficult to apply in an even coat. May try one of the other related types - liquid or spray - I'll have to think about it
B00I548U0K|5|Took 30 minutes to install, basic tools, very sturdy for kids and adults.  Look great and fit perfectly.
B00DX8C3JW|5|Great quality and stitching, sizing perfect and enough pockets for everything you need without being too overwhelming.  The buttons are a little tough to begin with but loosen up with a little use.  I particularly like the look of a black denim vest over leather and tend to stand out a little with the difference.

B0036QVCOI|3|Pros: The one side of the plate that is painted BLACK is very nice ... Heavy Duty plate for sure ...  Cons: For $20 the back side of the plate should have been painted black, as well as the front side ... My order DID NOT INCLUDE the &#34;Comes with assorted screws and matching screw covers&#34;, as indicated by the Amazon item description ... Don't care about the &#34;Mustang / WWW.CARBEYONDSTORE.COM hanging air freshener&#34; that WAS INCLUDED with the license plate ...  If both sides of this plate had been painted black, & had I received the screws & screw covers; this would have easily been a five star product / review ...

B00ONH84XG|5|Fit fine on a 95 nissan pickup
B00GWWUEJ2|4|Looks good.  Almost perfect fit,  if you look close you can see how the fitment is a bit off around the edges.  If not for that would of gave 5 stars.
B003WOZOUM|5|Although it was a pain to pack it once it was on top of the car I have to say that this worked wonderfully. We've used it twice to drive two thousand miles from Arizona to Michigan and then back. One of those trips it rained. The entire drive. Not fun. Our suitcase and bedding was in the bag and I was expecting them to be wet from 38 hours of almost continual rain but everything was dry. Also, if you aren't an idiot, it's simple to use and easy to secure. I have a regular car add it was awesome to have all the extra space during the drive.
B00O2BZC92|3|I love it. still debating whether to put it on my laptop or car though...
B008SNXYTU|1|to long. poor quality
