B003E30L36|4|Good
B00O3D165S|1|Where do I begin?  First...had I know they came from China, I would NEVER have bought them.  Second...how hard is it to make a PAIR of Booties that fit.  ONE of each is huge and the other just ill fitting - large.  Can't keep one or the other on my feet, and the non-skid feature are really just round little dots GLUED to the bottom.  Here a dot, there a dot...everywhere ON THE FLOOR A DOT!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!  SOME ITEMS NEED A MINUS RATING!  THIS ONE GETS A MINUS 50 !!!
B007XOE21E|4|First time ordering anything by Tea Collection.  Very happy with the Rhohkea Stripe Bubble Dress.  Well Made. Vibrant color. Have now ordered more from them and can't wait to receive them.
B00E0L2ZXU|5|Bigger then I thought it would be and the fabric was thinner, but still has a unique style and fun to wear.
B00BBOMSS6|1|so I would like to purchase theskrt but after seeing all the review how do I know for sure that If i request a small or a medium im really going to get the size
B004HJNMOQ|5|Love these ties.  My husband gets complimented all the time.
B00EUZ28L0|3|Very  adorable but too tight  my 4year old  girls  big belly ...i  think this  will  perfect  to  skinny 5 girl
B00CXMYAYU|5|good deal
B00EB12NL8|5|I absolutely LOVE these jeans!  I'm short and petite and these jeans fit me perfectly.  The sit low on the hips which is how I like my jeans, but the legs aren't monstrously long so I don't have to roll the cuffs.  I could not be happier with these jeans.
B0012M663U|5|Great, comfortable. And minimizes well.
B002SQ0F6I|5|This saved me money on my college graduation cap. It does cover quite a bit of your head so be prepared to role the bottom.
B0000AT7NL|4|Sharp looking jeans and color. Great fit from a quality company and name !!
B002NZJNMQ|5|excellent
B003Z6PE20|5|Very happy with wallet , my son really likes it
B0035WTSLC|1|....didn't even make it out the house and they were rip....rip off!! Save your money!  They were very cheaply made.
B0055CPRB0|5|I bought mine direct from TravelSmith about two or three years ago; and it's actually a lot nicer than it looks in this particular photo. There's a hidden interior drawstring in the back that tapers the jacket a bit, for a more fitted look -  so it's not quite as loose and baggy as the photo makes it appear. It wears like a casual sport coat or blazer. It also comes in two other colors: Navy and Almond (a &#34;coffee with cream&#34; medium shade of brown). This jacket is very light weight, yet warm enough (with long sleeve shirts) to very comfortably handle 40 to 60 degree (Farenheit) weather. It's also water repellent, so it's very effective as a (light rain) raincoat. It doesn't wrinkle, and it washes well. During the spring and fall I wear it almost exclusively. I'm going to London next month, and this is the jacket I'm taking with me. It's a wonderful casual coat that dresses up real nice when you put on a tie. I really can't praise this jacket enough.
B009WULLCA|5|i bought my other grandson this robe. he loves the dino pictures and sleeps cuddled in the worm soft selves.he loves it! thank you from them both
B001FSKA9W|5|When I went back to Penneys for two more of the same bra in different colors, they were all out.  No wonder: this is the most comfortable bra ever.
B00FKK787I|5|Love this scarf. I get so many compliments when I wear it
B00CPKDYQK|4|Bought this for my granddaughters birthday and she loves it.  The only problem is the front neckline.  It is quite low for a 7 year old.  To overcome that problem, she wears the dress with cami top.
B003759SEY|2|Don't waste your money on these wannabe military pants...they don't hold up as well, are nothing like the real thing, and don't have a similar fit.  I look around and buy used, but real military cammies (or BDUs if your Army) when I can find them.  They last much longer and are designed to what they do, unlike the cheap knock offs, which are not so cheap.<br /><br />If you're just trying to look cool and not using them for practical purposes, then join the military...
B00CWA3MW4|5|BUT I ORDERED IT LARGE!  It's gorgeous!!!
B00ARIKG6S|4|I got this for a Cleopatra dress. I used a blue and gold scarf to tie around my daughter's waist and it was perfect! BUT, the dress if very loose and free flowing. It's such a pretty dress, I really wish it wasn't quite so loose, but we will re use it and use a different belt :)
B00MJ5IVP0|3|I bought this for a Halloween costume for my daughter for her If You Give a Mouse a Cookie book character.  It was perfect for her.  The minute I washed it, it was done though.  It served it's purpose.
B001JE3GRA|4|The color is just like the sky, so pretty. The hat is comfy and light in weight. I need a few more colors and I'll be set :)
B00FVTNZ20|1|I ordered this dress when I was asked to be a bridesmaid for a wedding that was going to occur in three weeks. Most of the websites dedicated specifically to bridesmaid dresses took a long time to ship so I checked amazon.<br /><br />However this dress was sent to me in the wrong size. It was not prime so by the time I received I did not have enough time to exchange it and get the proper one to me by the date of the wedding.<br /><br />Also not being prime I had to pay for shipping to me and back for the return, which I am not happy about. I am not returning it because I didn't like, they sent me the wrong size and now I have to pay to send it back. Not cool.<br /><br />Finally the dress is not of the highest quality. The wiring in the chest is very sharp and jabs into you (I have never had a problem or complained about an underwire bra or boning in a dress, I am not sensitive it is just designed in a very uncomfortable way) and the silk lining was sewn in a way that it came above the material and was exposed a bit near the sweetheart neckline.
B00BK4NEDK|3|Ordered this in large for my wife who has a 28 inch waist and 36 chest when it arrived we attempted to put it on but, even pulled to its absolute tightest it was very loose around the waist and fit ok/poorly around the bust. She would have fit into a medium best and I imagine would probably also fit into a small seeing as she was well below the minimum for a large the back ties like a normal corset so if you are in the middle of the range of two sizes order down and cinch to fit, it sucks too because it would have looked great, good looking product the snaps on the front leave something to be desired though they are solid strips of opposing snaps that all have to be snapped at the same time which is a semi difficult process even when the thing was dead loose I cant image trying to get those things snapped if it was already fitted to the person putting it on. Shipping times are ridiculous as well the estimate will post a time of some odd \\"months\\" really like just under 2 months it actually took it two weeks to get here.
B00SB1NKTS|5|Looks great and fits great
B00APZ5VM2|1|I ordered this swimsuit in my normal size(medium). The top of this suit fits fine but the bottom not so much. Its cut extremely low and did not cover my entire backside(I literally had crack showing, not good!) In my opinion, if you possess any type of curves to your bottom half (mainly the butt) this is not the swimsuit for you.  I did contact the seller and they were kind enough to ship me a large but alas the bottom still does not fit properly.  I am 5'll and slim, I normally wear a size 6 bottom and medium tops.  I believe because this suit is being shipped and made in China their sizing is totally off compared to US sizing.
B00APVJZ5U|5|These shorts are well made from the material to the zipper to the belt.  They are stylish and fit well.  Excited to break them in!
B00KRDGYNM|5|very cute. a little big for my table ,but its nice.
B00AOCW7O6|5|I absolutely love this top.  I have already worn it out twice and both times I have received several compliments on it.
B009FX8ODI|1|I usually wear size 6 dress so I chose a medium size based on another review. This dress was way too small for me!!! The material was nice but it had no stretch what so ever, so I could not even get it on me to see how it fitted!....I'm disappointed because I had to give it away
B004MJXMS2|5|My twin daughters turned one and these were their outfits for a party at the park. They were perfect. We bought the matching bib and hat to complete the look. My daughters are tall - 95th % - thankfully, these outfits just fit them. So, if your child is on the bigger side, the pants might be a little tight. That's my only complaint with the product.
B008AV47T6|4|Just needed a simple bag to carry my tae Kwon Do gear. Perfect for it.  This is a basic bag but that is what I was looking for.
B00KFEFJSY|1|Way too small
B000EPGPK0|4|This corset is absolutely beautiful.  The quality is really good, and Amazon has it priced really well.
B008CV62TC|5|This dress is absolutely breathtaking! Thankfully I read the reviews and knew what to expect with it fit wise-  a size 6 fit my 32DD chest perfectly. The only thing I had to do was go get it tailored because at 5'2 I am very petite and was swimming in this dress. It looks extremely elegant on and I got a ton of compliments. I will certainly be wearing it to many more events in the future and will seek out more dresses by Ever Pretty for years to come.
B003XMU0AM|5|I don't know if she is still using it but Christmas she looked adorable!
B00ID4RTCM|4|what i exspected
B0013KOISQ|5|I really haven't had the opportunity to wear the shirt  but I have tried it on and it fits just fine
B009W298WS|5|My uncle liked these very much.
B0038WCLPE|3|Many areas on the tunic where the dye was splattered and it did not wash out.  Doubt that I would buy from this vendor again.
B000VZ9WT4|5|I was reading so many comments about and wasn't sure if buy it but really surprised me when I got it, material is good but I was thinking about it like covering the whole head but anyway looks really nice
B00FMAGS3Q|4|Built from mesh & good reusable shopping bag material.  Worked great in backpack!
B00BQ6LPEC|5|Fit is spot on. Love it.
B00J3B0278|5|These pants are great. Really stretchy, very cute, and long enough for my baby to grow into.
B0002TVZMQ|5|I am absolutely thrilled to realize that I can buy Gold Toe Cotton Fluffies from Amazon.  I now have no reason to go to a department store in a mall ever again.<br /><br />It is particularly exciting to order more than $25 of socks in a single order and then track their (free) shipping by UPS all the way from Coffeyville, Kansas to my home in Massachusetts by way of such exotic stops as Oklahoma City, OK, and Earth City, MO.<br /><br />I ordered 3 each of the new Denim Heather and 3 of the Olive.  I also ordered two of the less-expensive three-packs in Navy and Black.<br /><br />I love the name Denim Heather, and I am really excited about wearing these to work on Monday morning.<br /><br />The Olive socks were not as green as I expected: they are really a shade of Brown.  I own many pairs of Brown Cotton fluffies and I fear that sorting my laundry in artificial light may prove difficult now with the inclusion of two shades of Brown socks.  Time will tell.
B00AQZMPP2|5|It is a very beautiful item. Very new and different style due to the imitation of a chemise on its top side design. It is coverinhg the body altogether and this saves us the pain of finding another item to use on top.
B00870N87M|5|Love my carhartts.  6'1&#34; 200 and 34x32 is a little tight at first.  Then wears in perfect after a few washes
B00CPGN3W4|2|I saw this shirt and thought it was perfect for a luau theme party i was going to.  Got it in and it was super cut but pretty tight across the chest.  I think the rest of it fit ok but it was for sure not buttoning at top
B005N3TRT4|5|Soft. Good price.
B00S31GY76|5|I love this dress. Very flattering and comfortable
B0085OJJA0|4|I wear either size small or medium shirts (34B/36A bra) and size 6 pants.  This suit (in size 12) fits me perfect.<br />I love the retro look.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about this suit would be to continue the &#34;skirt&#34; look around the back.  The back of the suit looks like a regular 1-piece suit, but the front looks a little like a skirt/skort.
B0061DE6HS|5|It meets the expectations of a military jacket that I was looking for.  If only it had side hand pockets.
B001JBNDLW|4|It's underwear.  What else can be said?
B0038JOSWQ|2|Quality not great. Waistband frayed on on pair
B00E421MNO|5|I normally wear a 34C, but in this bra the band runs a little on the larger side just enough that the 32D fits me perfectly.  With the smaller band, the shoulder straps ride in the right place on my shoulders.  I have this bra in 4 colors.
B008H2ETBE|5|They fit my feet, they keep my feet warm, they are white, the price was good, and they feel like socks.
B009S33O4O|5|Great dress but the bust size was big, I am a B cup so it didn't work for me and I am a size 16
B00OG6QD96|5|Can't wait to try these out.  So glad they fit.  I'm a size 5 and very hard to fit.
B00J0HCOBC|5|very high quality and excellent value
B0085J8YI8|3|ok
B00553XJUA|5|Finally a bra without any wire that supports and has comfortable straps. I loved it from the moment I put it on.
B007W0XM6A|2|The quality of the material used in the construction of this item seemed adequate enough; however, the sizing is completely off. I wear a 1X - the detail stated that an XXL is the same as a 2X - which is incorrect - I purchased the XXL and couldn't get a leg in.  In most stores,  XXL is a misses sizing, while 1X, 2X . . .  are women's sizing - they are not the same nor are they compatible. So this item should not be identified as women's wear
B00RCJVRW2|4|Great material but I had to reorder a bigger size!
B003E6CZ6Y|4|For a work jacket it could be a little longer (from waist to neck). And I think the pockets suck. Any thing bigger than a 6'' screw driver  loves to fall out -  sitting, standing, climbing ladders.<br /><br />It is incredibly warm, and durable (so far). Sleeves aren't baggy so no worries about getting it caught up in tools or anything.<br />Overall its a nice jacket.
B00HVUI85G|5|Very nice tie.
B00CP8M46S|3|Cute shirt but way too large for my nieces size.
B009ERDM6E|5|Just as advertised, color is true to picture.  I have gotten a compliment on this set every day I've worn it!
B00QX6041A|5|Love the fit!  Not big on the ties.  I just cut them off and roll up the pants legs, problem solved!  :)
B00BOJUCS6|5|Bought this for my Mom, we are going to a Kid Rock concert this summer, she loves it.  Fit perfect, design is cool.
B009S0S44W|5|Great gift she loved them
B00IJII502|5|I love this dress. Very flattering. I am 5'4 and about 140 lbs and the medium fits perfectly. It is a little sheer but thats an easy fix. Very cute dress!
B0057DWBI4|1|I bought a shirt that looked like this last year, but it had a different name. It was black with purple writing on it. The shirt was a bit thicker than this, as this one is pretty thin. I bought this one because I liked the other shirt and would prefer the white on black.<br /><br />I got it yesterday, decided that I could live with how thin it is. I also got 2 other shirts (one Altamont and one Quicksilver). Put them in the laundry today so that I could begin to wear them. Took it out of the laundry an hour ago. The other 2 shirts were just fine, but this one... The white screen print on it was missing from 1/3 of the shirt! The areas where it wasn't gone yet, had huge cracks in it. The area UNDER where the white screen print had been is this horrible off/dirty white color.<br /><br />The shirt looks HORRIBLE!!! I didn't even get to wear it once. What a piece of garbage. I am going to try and upload the picture I took of it. Don't buy this!!! You can't return it after you wash it, and it looks just fine up until you do.
B00GYLP1V2|4|Love the price , loved the dress !
B00E6BXGB4|5|The belt holds on nice, very lightweight and works great with my snowboarding pants or any other pants for that matter.
B00K0KDPX4|5|Good
B00BUCKBR4|4|broke quickly
B00KAZR27E|3|Looks as pictured but size runs small
B00HWHBHOC|4|I really like these jeans. They don't fit right if you don't have a butt that's for sure. Only thing is that the American flag ones aren't red. They're silver with stripes. Still cute though
B00JXLYHF6|4|Fits pretty tight. I'm usually a size 8/10 got the large and had a bit of a struggle to put on the bottoms. The stitching on the top is a little ehhh but for the price worth it. Can always mix and match tops.<br /><br />Delivery was very fast, less than a wk. straps were not attached but inside the package. Did not look as if it had damaged or previously worn.
B00OAUNP30|2|Pls let me know if there is any way to change it. It is extremely large for my brother nd surely he cannot wear it.
B00LLIVQM6|5|Great quality
B00865TG1U|5|We ordered Thing 1 and Thing 2 shirts.  They were exactly what we wanted.  The sizes were almost perfect. !
B00LCUDMZW|3|So If you can get over a few gripes with these pants, you will absolutely love them!<br />First Off: I Ordered a 36x31 and when they arrived the fit was ALMOST perfect...(Keyword ALMOST); The biggest complaint i Have is that they are  snug on my Hamstrings...(BUT I am a power lifter so...) other than that they fit well at the waist and the butt area is perfectly fine as well as the length and calf area..<br />Second: To see if the 38X31 was a better fit, i bought a pair..They arrived and everything was perfect except for two things, The waist was a bit bigger than i expected but i don't mind that since I'd be wearing a Belt, the only Major down side is that the Butt Area is too big. its so Big that i Have to raise the pants to My Belly Button to not look like I'm Sagging my pants..(I only find that as a gripe since i'm not used to wearing my pants that high, usually around the waist or a bit higher)<br />I'm a 17 year old at about 5'11 but weigh at about 230 lbs, I typically use a 36 x 30 but its seems that the 36 x 31 seems to be the closest fit for me, I just have to stay away from the deadlifts more often. Other than that i have not had any other issues in terms of fit. But have run into a build quality issue where the button is already about to come off, its nothing major since i only payed $13.99 for them and the fact that sewing it will fiox it but i expected some better build quality. To Make a long review short i recommend going with your normal size first and then going to a bigger size if the other doesn't  fit
B00EZHW2XW|5|Great dress fit as it should
B00AQZGQD4|5|This is a fitted Cherokee scrub top.  If you have a larger chest  you will want to order a size up.  Very cute and works well with many colors of pants.
B001FOR4PY|5|It is soft. Very good for casual wearing. Please beware that the buckle is easily scratched. So store it in a soft case is prefered. Overall, the quality is great. It deserves five stars.
B00O417F54|5|Beautiful dress, nice quality -- I'm very pleased with the product and customer service.
B001MXKKGS|3|Comfortable, but short
B001CBEZYI|5|will be buying more ...lots more!
B00B301MQM|3|the product isn't as amazing as the picutres shows it to be but it will work for what i need it for . It came in a huge and cumbersome box though..when it coulda been mailed in a smaller and more convivent box that doestn't waste space<br /><br />Still..at least my cats have a new box to play in  i guess..
B004YLYNWM|5|Purchased this for my grandson. The only downfall was my son was disappointed that it didn't come in an adult size for him!
B007PCRD74|5|GREAT SWIM TRUNKS.  GOOD FIT.
B008FCBP1S|5|I love these jeans I bought them in a size 16 and they fit perfectly I thought I would have to go up a size but found in a different pair of jeans that was not a good idea. Definitely buy the size you normally wear.
B00C7INN7A|1|Awful experience.
B00R11Q4JC|5|This bathing suit is exactly like the triangl ones! It's really cute on and it is real neoprene! I am a size 4 and a 34C and the medium fits perfectly! The fabric is neoprene so it does not stretch very much. The only downside to this product is I wish it has some padding. It has no support there, but the straps are adjustable. Overall I love the bathing suit and can't wait to wear it! Plus it came in 3 days!!
B006OCN410|5|This is an awesome jacket. I own one and must say it's one of the best jackets I have ever seen. You have some idiot reviewers (reviewers NOT purchasers) that don't understand the purpose or real-world necessity of genuine Coyote fur. Coyote fur is used because it does not ice up in cold weather like synthetic fur. All in all, a mega value for your money. This coming from an ex-military guy who actually wore the jacket!
B005FKNJGC|1|I normally wear a medium, the legging was marked medium/large but appeared to be more on the small/medium side.  Very dissatisfied with the fact that after wearing for a few hours, the material gave way near the seams and holes appeared.  Definitely not worth purchasing, the quality and sizing are not as expected.
B00MWDQAPW|5|I really like these socks! They are a silky smooth fabric, nice and long at the top and slide on very nicely over the foot with plenty of give. I should order more.
B00FBKMDTU|4|My daughter loved this for her halloween costume.
B00KPP6T64|4|for the most part i love it there were some that didn't work for me but others were great
B0072D93WY|3|Product is made strictly for big and tall men.  If you are a woman more than likely it will not fit.  It appears to be made of quality  material and the design is amazing; however I had to return it.
B00JVCLJ8U|5|I just love this cap as it more than I expected.  The color of the decal was great as it stands out.  I will love wearing this cap everywhere I go.
B006Z2CH4E|5|I love this shirt and so does my daughter!!!! I ordered different designs by the same company. It's not that easy to find stylish and organic cotton outfits. I try my best to dress my child in organic cotton if not all cotton and comfortable outfits only. This company also seems to use natural fabric dyes. I highly recommend it.
B00CKXA24Y|5|Looks great on! Love the style and basic colors of it! I'm 5'5 34B with a long torso and it goes to the center to top of my back pants pockets! Bought in other colors!
B00M1267BQ|4|This skirt fits true to size. I am 5'2&#34; about 128lbs, size 2-4 US. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly. Happy with my purchase. It is a bit see through but all bandage skirts are made out of the same material so its not just subjected to this brands quality; all are the same.
B0051SL140|3|It is a delicate product, can not be machine washed and scratches that deteriorate the Pledge.<br />The provider does not failita this information. Also do not indicate that the garment shrinks and unpleasant that you fall short of stature
B00STU9TZK|5|love it...
B009MBKFTO|5|My husband likes it and the colors are nice and great quality. Would purchase more for sure! Great quality purchase!
B005ZMNGGS|3|I love Doublju clothing this particular item however is ok. It fits good but i feel like u can only wear this one time and thats it cause is so recognizable. If youre gonna buy this do yourself a favor and purchase the gray one cause the black one is hard to see the details.
B004I7473W|2|I was very disappointed in these gowns.  I wear a large size and honestly don't want see through garments.  Very think material and not a breathable material.  These might be just the thing for some people but not for me.  I am giving them to a women shelter.
B00P86Z46Q|2|Cool design, great fit, but my son wore a hole in them the first day.  Will not buy again.
B00IVEE9YK|5|I have received nothing but compliments on this t-shirt. My sister keeps telling me that if my shirt was a size larger, she would steal it off my back. I smile when I look at it and as t-shirts have become my primary wardrobe, it's nice to have some fun shirts.
B00TDN778I|4|Looks like good quality.<br />Just bought. So if it lasts, it's a good deal.
B007Z3QK5O|5|Love the dress, can't beat the price!
B00J7L68PY|3|Ok so i love this suit however the top is way too small.The bottom fits perfect though... Im going to have to get another top but for the price the bottom was all i needed anyways. would recommend...
B00F843LPY|5|Very nice shirt. It's a little emasculating, in that it sort of looks like a blouse, but I was going for style and that's exactly what it gives me. This shirt looks exactly like the picture. It fits perfectly. Stretchy sort of fabric. Nice fitted look. Love it!
B004FUYZUW|5|good product
B00EPQSLWY|4|hat is nice, and my fiance loves it....beach dweller....the only problem was that it got stolen by a USPS worker in the process and arrived in a little rough condition. i gave it four stars because it needs to be straightened out and doesnt look that good right now. would rec. if you like hurley products, cool color and fitted hat....now for my opinion, i tried it on, i felt a little, how should i say, feminine. i started talking slightly higher, throwing my pinky out when drinking, and rolling my eyes. i have never tried a hurley product before, but now i can see why aussies and surfers like it. I am fond of the color, but it makes me look really caucasion. i mean i am irish and very white, but i like to feel brazilian from time to time.
B009HIQPDW|5|Love this brand
B00N4SL8JM|3|I like the style of the top and the lace, however I don't care for the nylon fabric of the top, I was hoping it would be more cotton spandex stretch.
B00IOTMJ8U|5|Love
B001FOZY2O|4|I hadn't had an opportunity to wear these since I ordered them some time ago, but with the record cold we've been having, today was the perfect time. In spite of the diagram that came with the ear muffs, I had a little trouble figuring out how to get them over my ears. Once I realized I was bending them the wrong way, it was a snap. I wore them under a hoodie and I have to say that my ears stayed warm in spite of the wind that occasionally blew up under the hood.
B000A38GCQ|4|Wonderful to have a Khaki pair of the Wrangler Rugged Wear slacks again! They're the best of the Big & Tall, pleased pants on the market as far as I can see. Wore my last pair out!
B00LWU71CW|5|Very cute fitted as expected.
B000SZM73U|5|Great buy. Good cushiony socks
B006UCPQMO|5|Fit great. A beautiful dress.
B008CD5QOM|4|Great coat! I lift weights, so the sleeves are tight around the biceps, but it probably fits most skinny dudes pretty well.
B004BIPEM6|5|I loved the movies, since I was a kid watching them every Sunday morning. Received it just before the 2014 US movie release and I got a lot of great comments.
B00JJ764W8|5|They are just as they should be....l am very pleased.
B00PK11RDI|5|Comfy and don't make you feel fat
B00BF9ERFY|5|My son is 6&#34;4, and I swear - 6 feet of him is all leg.  He is very long-legged... So it's always hard to find him shorts that are long enough. They hit him right at the knee, maybe even slightly above, and they look great. And the price is also great since he lives in shorts pretty much year-round. I am very happy about this purchase.  (If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking &#34;yes&#34; at the end of my review!)
B00L65T7DY|3|Comfy but doesn't fit too well
B000A0CNLO|5|Worked great for Minnesota winter!
B0099JQJQM|1|Not for women with boobs
B00LEOODHW|4|Don't think the color matches the picture on the site. It appears gray instead of black ordered.
B00EPMAHSY|4|Good buy for the money. Side as advertised.no need to order up
B004MDMVSU|5|It fit my size, wear nicely and hang well, very good quality, light and comfortable wit good price. Love this pants.
B00MYBPSH8|4|Buy a size larger than you normally wear. They run small. However, they are great quality!
B005GS0498|5|I love the look and feel of the shirt! The order took less time to arrive than what the scheduled time stated! Thanks to all those fire fighter brothers and sisters out there!
B007FE2YOY|2|Does not look like the photo in the ad, but the price was inexpensive.
B00F0HF89G|5|Love them. Wear them with boots over jeans or with dresses. Adds just enough pop to a boring outfit.def would recommend
B00862D4KC|5|I love these pants. They are more like jeans than my Levi's. I'm going to get more in the future.
B00EEE7GVY|4|Ordered a size 38 based on the previous reviews. I normally where a 36. The 38 fits fine, not too big. They do run small but I also like a little bit of extra room around the waist. They seem like a good pair of trunks.
B0077L59MY|5|My husband loves Reyn Spooner shirts and when I saw this one for such a good price I could not pass it up.<br />It is soft and the design on it was just what he wanted.  It is excellent quality as are all Reyn Spooner shirts.<br />It arrived faster than the time quoted so I was very happy about that also.<br />That shirt just said \\"Buy Me\\"
B00KLUTHYY|2|so so
B000YZ3QWK|3|mistake
B000H663V2|4|I purchased this wig for Halloween and it worked well for my costume (I was Leela from futurma).  I hung it in a pony tail and it worked well!
B001HNOEYM|5|I LOVED THE HAT BUT IT WAS TO SMALL FOR FRIENDS HEAD THIS HAT IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00XTYUC5M|1|The leg holes are HUGE!!! It is not cut anything like it looks like on the model. If I pull it up as high as her, all of my fat rolls would be hanging out on the sides... Very disappointed.
B0018OZL60|5|nice fitting jeans
B000PWIVVI|4|Pros:  Great coverage, unique look, comfortable<br />Cons:  Warm in hot weather, not waterproof (and not advertised as so, but would be nice) back brim hits seat rest while in the car.<br /><br />Overall a great hat and a nice change from the standard baseball hat.
B00KOGS2VE|4|I really like this dress. Fit really good!
B00HME0CIC|5|Fits well and I like the style
B0013KSBYS|2|The holster itself seems to be good quality construction.  I purchased this for use with a .25 ACP, probably one of the lightest handguns.  But, the included strap is not strong enough to hold the gun in position on my leg.
B00EZXL6HY|3|Does not fit right..
B005V3F01K|4|I love the feel of this dress and the fit on the body but the only reason for the 4 stars, I am a 40DD and it does not provide complete bust coverage I have spillage under the armpits. I am going to figure a way to make it work, I'm going to keep the dress however the sizing is accurate on the chart so pay close attention. I would recommend this to anyone needing an XL and not as busty as I am.
B007OWV4M0|5|Great pajama pants.  Not too think and heavy, and very comfortable.  This is my second pair, and the others have lasted very well.
B004HLY45A|1|This product may work by making the lice fall off- but, I haven't seen anything but nits. Faint clean scent.   The product has a consistency more like H2O than what I was expecting.   I assumed since it listed essential oil- it would be a bit more the consistency of say- a conditioner. Since that is not the case,   it did not help with the comb thru after application. The hair actually got- gummy- after the 30 minutes (followed all their directions)   and started drying in various areas. On the second trial run, the next day....We shook the bottle through out application-   thinking maybe it needed to be mixed more . End result: It was not easy to get the metal Nit comb thru my son's short hair.   Rather disappointed - since the previous reviews brought us hope. I am going to contact the manufacturer... as I can't imagine having to comb thru longer hair!  If it Killed the nits... we will never know... it certainly didn't help un-glue them...
B00X3LE0WW|3|Giving only 3 stars because I can see some of the glue.<br />Fast shipping!
B003R9GKZK|3|snag super easy . Can only wear once. ( twice if lucky )
B00ATUX5VW|3|Size was way too big, but that is partially my fault. I thought that i could just tie the strings tight but the thigh size was also too large. I needed a size 30. But the quality was nice and the there was a net within the pants.
B00FCH54T8|4|Very comfortable!
B007QV94H6|5|All very pretty
B00MSC158E|5|Will be my favorite pair of weekend jeans, great fit and comfortable!
B00BKU8KXI|3|The dress is really pretty and the color is beautiful. However the dress is on the larger side and thus makes you look shapeless.
B0009MH2UA|5|The fabric is as thick as a normal T-shirt. It does seem to shrink a little bit in the wash, but I wouldn't add 1 size to your order because of it.<br /><br />You will not be able to roll up your sleeves with this long sleeve shirt. If you do, the sleeves will get all stretched out when you put your sleeves back down and stay loose around your arms for awhile. As soon as you wash them again, they will return to normal.<br /><br />There was a great price on these long sleeve shirts and they were definitely worth it and I would recommend them.
B000BU5P3G|4|The item came promptly and in good condition, although the image made it look like a baseball cap not a visor.
B000YV9CKO|4|Well made, but does run small. We used as a costume and had to exchange for larger size. Overall happy.
B00I8OVZWC|1|The seams on the side of the thighs are not very strong and were slit open when it  arrived. I would not recommend this product
B005Q614KI|5|It's my girls favorite Shirt.  Happy to have found it. I can usually search on amazon to find anything we're looking for. That's great.
B008F4GRWI|4|The jacket was a pretty color and nice quality, but I had to return it because it was too small.  I ordered size XL which is supposed to fit size 16-18, but it fit more like a 14-16.
B001A6ECPW|3|These run very large compared to size...I will have to  do some altering on it to get it small enough to fit me.
B00LIO16PA|3|This is extremely large for the size I bought. It sags in the back and the front chest area is way to big. I get I am not a big chested gal, but to get this to not sag and bag i have to pull it up so high it looks ridiculous. Will see if i can get this altered to fit better .
B00365F9G6|5|I was impressed with a black Columbia's Men's Watertight Jacket although I have had little time to run this light jacket through all its paces. I live in Eastern Tennessee and this jacket, basically a waterproof windbraker, should be sufficient for most of the time except in the dead of winter. I think it is a comfortable jacket although I have yet to wear it during strenuous physical activities. I am 5'11'' and around 200 pounds and the large size gave me plenty of space but not so much that I was swimmming around in it. I like it a little loose (for movement and layering) so if you like a tighter fitting jacket, I'd say that a medium size, for someone around my height and weight, would probably be O.K. If I find any exceptionally good or poor aspects to this jacket over time, I will add them to this review.
B008ATLQ9C|3|I was hoping the smart touch was gonna reach all the way to the side thumb, it did not also you have really put it in otherwise the tips won't function well.
B00E1R8X7A|4|when i got the wallet it looked kinda cheap which i didn't like ,but i said ill give it a try and I'm actually amazed its really good product i can't say its worth 50 but defently love it now
B00B8SO5YA|4|These shorts run a little small, but fit well on a slender body. If your child is not real slender, you may want to get a size bigger than his usual size, otherwise you'll be disappointed.
B00N2CHE8O|1|Extremely small... short and wide...
B00IOGXFKO|5|Very cute!
B006IG8H78|5|Alpinestars shirts are always well made and fit true to size and never shrink. Good brand with good quality shirts
B001UTALYK|5|The material and stitching are in good order, and the general fit is good around the trunk and arms.  The neck bulges out a lot in the middle but I suppose that's better than choking on it.
B00NN6VKR0|4|Good one brought it for my wife she loved it the buttons came out on first use need to tie it else this is fine
B000FOOHT6|5|Just as expected, no complaints!
B00570KF9E|5|Kids love it and it is soft and fun for all the kids. Easy to order for us also. Fun!
B00HSE8NRI|4|Ordered for my husband And he loves it.
B00JSJHQP6|5|Perfect.  Exactly the right money clip!
B008398R32|5|seems to be working fine. so far thank you
B00NFBYNJ0|5|nice shirt.  fits & wears perfect
B00HE8EEV2|5|I wear this almost everyday there is a breeze in the summer.
B00IFZVNLC|4|It does look nice. When I touched it, it feels rather itchy. You have to painstakingly find the button hole on the black material that matches the button on the other black panel. The hole is too small for the size of the button. I had to make it a little bit bigger. Now, it's just right and hope the recipient will like it as well.
B00D3RDF5Y|5|The fit was perfect, the knit was soft, and I loved the snug fit.  The garment did not shrink or loose its shape after washing.
B00NW2K3ZA|1|I'm a medium. Ordered a large to be safe. The sleeves were way too narrow. Sent back!
B00TOAJ1KM|5|I love this dress! The prints are so vibrant and the dress is well made! But it runs large! I usually wear a size large in PUG, but I ordered a medium on this and it fits me fine not tight at all and I have double D's. It's lined on the bust for extra support that I can go bra less! Love it the material is heavy duty! Will buy again! Great Nathan for the price!
B004U0IRGU|5|The reviews almost scared me away BUT they both work and my little disabled brother LOVES THEM. He loves anything that changes color or has a light show. His birthday is the 11th of October and it came 7 days before the 11th and it said it was going to arrive the 15th I'm HAPPY it came early and that it works
B00S1L6PZY|5|This coat is so cute! It fits to size and looks great!
B000PCZ5JO|5|This is the best minimizer bra I've found for me & that's why I ordered 3 more.  Great shape, doesn't ride up, stretchy material holds you snugly.  Cups are not stretchy and that's a plus that allows for a good shape while holding you snug.  I ride horses and it's better than a sports bra!!!  Just hope this style isn't discontinued any time soon.
B001TJNPRQ|4|the costume is pretty decent i mean its not the 300 dollar avengers quality costume but for 25 bucks it will make a good costume. it is very large though so be aware of that i am a shorter very broad guy and it still is alittle baggy but i am going to edit it a small amount to make it work however the colors are vibrant and its a fun costume! the mask though is absolutly terrible pay the 10 bucks and the one of the vinyl masks it improves the costume 400% oh! and the red white and blue stripes do not go all the way around its just on the front
B00J3B0NZ4|5|Soooo comfortable!  I love the pattern.  Only issue is that they have faded a bit in the wash but that probably is more my fault then the products!
B00JSNORQI|3|Thanks!
B0009JOSAA|2|I thought the price on this set was great, well as tends to be true in life; &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;<br /><br />The onesies are very wide. This would not typically be a problem, except is causes an issue in the cloth area where you snap them together. The fabric tends to shift to one side or another, therefor letting the diaper be exposed. The other issue, the onesies with decals, they started to peel off after the very first wash. The ones that didn't peel off, have started curling up, while still partially attached to the article of clothing. May I note that I use baby detergent, and use the delicate cycle on both the washer and dryer. Even with this noted, one of the onesies has started to fray at the hem on the leg area.<br /><br />Overall, these are not great quality at all. But if you are looking to stock up on onesies at a low price, these are for you.
B00F3EI89S|5|I bought this after the underwire on my bra caused one of my ribs to crack when I leaned over my couch arm to pick up something I dropped.  What a relief it is to wear a comfortable bra that won't cause injury to your body.  This particular bra feels almost like not wearing a bra at all, which is a good thing.  I generally don't like lined bras, but the lining is light and subtle enough, that it doesn't add more to my ample bust size.  It, along with well-place stitching, adds support.  The one thing I would caution about is that I tried these on in a store before purchasing these bras.  According to the size chart provided, I should take size L. (I usually wear 38DD.)  If you are big busted, you will probably want to go up a size or two, so you don't spill out of the top or sides.  I bought XXL, and the fit is wonderful.  I am getting rid of all my killer underwire bras and buying several of these to replace them.
B001I82F4M|2|i didn't notice that i accidentally ordered a small. after opening it and trying to put it on i noticed that it was too small. i guess i was on a rush when i ordered it. i was kinda disappointed on myself. but i gave it as a gift anyway.
B005MR5O7A|5|I love these bows! They are not only ADORABLE but stay in my daughter's hair! There are so many styles and colors you can find the perfect bow for every occasion. My daughter is getting a reputation for her bows because I always have one in her hair. The customer service is FANTASTIC too. Bitty Bows are the only bows I will ever buy. You will not be disappointed!
B000LHTBX4|3|I am 6' tall, approx 150 lbs with a small bust and a generous hip area.<br /><br />I bought this for lap swimming at the rec center. I bought the long torso version, and am really glad I did, because even with that I feel it tugging a bit at my shoulders. The &#34;conservative&#34; leg opening is nice, but I feel it pinching my thighs (which are a little large in proportion to the rest of my frame, but not all that big compared to the average woman)<br /><br />Overall I will keep this rather than going through the hassle of returning it, but I look forward to finding my next one.
B00JRC56WE|5|NYDJ is fantastic. This color and fit is so flattering!
B00T3IV02W|4|good, 100% purely cotton, very comfortable in it
B00W6FSZ5E|2|As much as I loved this dress online I was disappointed when I took it out of the package. It fits according to my shape yes, however the sleeves where way to long, they are three quart sleeve, and on the picture it's not, and the front buttons are not placed proportionately like seen on the picture, they buttons seem on the smaller size as well. Now I have to have it mended to fit the original look! :-(
B00CZ8IICC|5|This is so cute. My daughter put it on yesterday to wear since it was finally cool enough. It has cute black bows at the ankles of the pants too. It fit perfectly in length too.
B003CU4DM6|5|Item is as described. Fit a bit snug but was comfortable and easy to wear.
B00UWD3TXK|5|I love this dress! Fits perfect! I was a little leery of the &#34;one size fits most&#34; sizing but it fits great! High quality  product. Will definitely order again.
B00FRY0H0M|2|Washed it just like they said and doesn't work after 1st wash not worth it . Going to get money back
B009H24X5A|5|I love this dress and how it fits.  I wish it came in more colors and I would buy more.  Very well made and the service was great too.
B00EOVI0DK|5|I love the design on the back.  The fabric is t-shirt like and very comfortable.  I wear a size large and it was true to sizing.
B002ZCWY82|3|Design is great - shirt fabric on the thin side.
B008J8N3PO|5|Very nice. Fits great overall and holds your front exceptionally well. Fits just as good if not better than my dkny's
B00KA2XL4U|5|My son loved them.
B00GT31TQQ|5|Excellent raincoat and my granddaughter loves it!
B006C6012I|4|The stitching on the bill is loose in places, but other than that it is excellent. It is very comfortable to wear.
B00H1XLPP8|3|The Neck  part of it was a little too big. The chest and back was find.
B00KC0IRLC|5|Incredible! These are the softest warmest leggings I've ever worn. I bought two and my sister even bought a pair. I might buy one more just to have in case they aren't around next year. Obsessed!!!
B00AYYTWVK|5|Excellent!
B003BNYB6M|2|I found the polo shirt too big. I think the size (medium) was not really respected.
B00G2NRLOM|5|I have had many compliments on this hat. Love it !!!
B00C10G1PK|2|Quality seems okay. Not sure how I missed the inconspicuous bright white lettering on it when I saw it here on Amazon, but I guess I did. I mean that's reeeeeally obvious. Who wants white letting on two parts of the front of a belt? Also, looked thinner in the pics, like a dress belt , which is what I was going for. Simply roo lazy to return for the cost.<br /><br />Would not recommend.
B00TF1QLKI|5|Love the color and fit of this bra .fit me vary well .
B005IYR83U|1|I recently purchased several pairs of these jeans to replace some jeans that were getting a little snug (Hey, I love Krispy Kremes).  Anyway, *EVERY* single pair has torn where the back left pocket is sewn to the denim covering the butt.  All of them had been washed (according to directions) less than three times and worn less than 5 days each.  Unfortunately, the return window of 30 days was insufficient to return the crap product (boo, Amazon!).  Absolutely piss-poor Jeans.  Worst I have owned in my life.  Aside from the pockets ripping off of the jeans, the front pockets are way too shallow and prone to losing thinks like your cell phone and car keys when you sit down in your car or a movie theatre seat, etc.  AVOID like the plague.  Pay the extra $$ and go with some Levi 559s if you want a similar fit but with higher quality.
B00G15MF2E|3|Sizes are not as they should be. ..
B008MC2O0M|5|Great products, no complaints. Thank you to michael and company, i will be buying more every chance i get in the future.
B002LSI3BC|5|LOVE!!!! BROUGHT FOR EMT TRAINING AND THEY FIT PHENOMENALLY. I LOVE THESE. I ORDERED NAVY BLUE SIZE 4. TRUE TO SIZE! EXACT FIT...I MEAN EXACT. WILL BE BUYING THE BLACK PAIR ASAP!!!
B00CF1XCOI|3|Very cute product but is small... The band size isn't true to size. However the bra itself is very well made and adorable... I am hoping I can use it after the baby gets here!!
B00HYYYPFQ|1|Small!!! Don't like
B00E9R0HVW|4|Very nice bra...
B0009G8CUK|4|I like it a lot, but after first wash, the sleeves got shorter. Still is very good. Need to reorder more......
B001D0604Q|5|Excellent!!!
B003S2MKQY|5|super cute!
B00H1YYXD8|4|Seem to be well made.  The fit seemed to be perfect.  The only thing I did not care for is the material is very thin (see through).  So, it will show a t shirt underneath.  But, I am still not sorry I purchased it.  I am using it for 1800's style of plays that I am in.  It will work fine for that, especially since I will probably wear it with a 1800's vest.   NOTE:  I liked it well enough that I ordered another one in black color.
B008CGQR6K|3|Read previous review saying the robe runs small so I ordered a large for my husband who is normally a medium to large (6 ft 170lbs).  The robe is too large on him.  The sleeves are super loose and long; it interferes with daily activity such as washing hands and dishes... I ended up folding and sewing the sleeves in place.<br /><br />This robe produces A LOT of LINT,  especially during the first wash... All my towels and T-shirts were covered with grey fuzz.... so wash it by itself first time or with similar colored items.<br /><br />Other than size and lint issues, the robe is soft and comfortable to wear.  It is warm but not too thick for a heated room in the winter.
B00BU8MEF0|4|Delivery was in good time and good condition.  The t-shirt is great.  I got to show it off when relatives from<br />the UK came to visit. They are Manchester United fans.  Lots of fun.
B0060S0J1G|5|After reading reviews on how some people absolutely loved them while others had horrible experiences and it wasn't at all what they ordered I was hesitant to order this but man, I'm so happy I did! It is so soft and warm. Everything about it is comfy. My kids who are 8 and 5 even love wearing it. It does fit them too. The scarf part with paws might be a little long for them but they are definitely able to wear it.
B00H7UPWT0|5|very good
B00JFSQ29Q|3|If you are bigger busted the top will not hold you unless your wearing a strapless bra underneath. It comes in 2 pieces! The fabric is very cheap so be careful zipping it up & washing it. I gave it 3 stars because I was able to fix it to my liking by adding a strapless bra & accessories & my husband absolutely loved it on me. I added fishnet stockings & heels to it to make it complete. I ordered an XL bc I am a size 14 but the skirt was a bit big.
B00K5LIMUE|5|Perfect for Halloween
B00GRNTKMI|3|I like this dress and it arrived sooner than expected.  The colors are slightly lighter than the picure and the material does not flow the way I expected.  My daughter says it's ok but nothing special. Because if that and the price, this dress gets 3 stars.
B000RZQ5IE|1|Maybe my expectations were too high after reading the great reviews, but I was expecting this bag would at least be functional.  The style and size were great, but I wonder if anyone actually used the bag.  What good is a cool looking bag if it cannot hold together?  The velcro patches used to keep the bag shut came unsewn just from opening and closing it a few times.  Do yourself a favor and go to your local store, and if it falls apart you can at least return it easily and get a full refund.
B000PQFNU6|3|I have a medium sized-head for a woman (I'm 5'9\\" medium build) and this moves around too much. I think if my head were bigger it would stay put better. Looks great and wide brim helps with lateral exposure.
B009YLK3GW|5|Cute little hat.  Warm.  Goes with my winter coat and dresses the drab gray up a little.
B00INYCG7A|5|Great quality
B007F52GOQ|5|Somewhat better than the Wigwam socks I purchased a couple of months ago. Where size 15 and they fit good.
B00LUAWEF8|5|This skirt is really cute and I get lots of compliments! It falls almost mid-calf and I am 5'8.
B00BHB4XNQ|5|These are perfect for my daughter's school concerts, very good quality and much thicker than others. I would definitely buy them again.
B008ETXFJC|4|Nice dark color. Skinny bootcut. The quality of the material is 90% cotton and 5% spandex which is very  nice! Love the thick quality vs other thin stretch material jeans.
B001MKOKH6|5|The quality of this pea coat is excellent; it is well made and has inside pockets.  The fit was perfect for my son who has long arms.  The best feature is that this is a TRUE pea coat.
B00H7NTCEI|5|my husband love these ties. the colors styles are perfect and at a great price.
B004KHW67O|2|I was hoping 10M would fit me, I'm 150-lbs and 5'6\\" in need of pants that don't gap in the lower back. Unfortunately these were too snug in the thigh for me to determine if the waist would or would not be an issue. They were also 2 inches too long even in my highest heel boots. So I returned them. I need to be thinner and taller for these, I'm sure they are otherwise awesome.
B00WRGBD6K|5|I just love the gorgeous dress!!1  I did order a large as I read where it is described as running a little small, and I am glad i did, as it is a perfect fit.!  It is well made of good quality material.  I would recommend it to wear and be patriotic.  Thank you Amazon for your great products and wonderful efficient service.  Can't sing your praises enough, I am so pleased.
B005LCMXH0|1|A small pony, Polo in the title?<br />I completely thought I was buying my nephew a ralph lauren polo shirt, silly me<br />It's being returned
B00A17VSY4|5|This caught my eye online and in person it's just as I imaged.  The bow really adds definition to the waist, yet it's quite forgiving at the same time.  The jersey is lightweight so I'd recommend wearing a slip underneath if you want to skim over any lumps and bumps.  A great dress for the office, but add a hat and some strappy heels and wouldn't look out of place at the races.
B004CM7ZQO|5|Wonderful Product! Tucks you in and smoothens you in all the right places.
B00JMQS1KY|5|Great sweatpants for the price, Excellent quality. the 2 strings strap is a plus for tying up, not like the one string loops, my go to sweat pants just on the go...
B00HNOQ5LY|4|Love the color and tshirt. Bought for my son but got it and it does run big. Will hold on to it until he grows into it.
B00014AORY|5|I have been very fortunate to discover Finn Comfort shoes and sandals, and to have worn them for the past 5 years. The perfect curved insole, the soft leather, the hand-stitching, and enough room for all my toes to spread naturally, contribute to create the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Ever since discovering Finn Comfort shoes, I have been spoiled and won't wear any other brand, except maybe for Birkenstock sandals. It is true that they are a bit pricey, but believe it when I say that each pair is worth every penny you invest.
B00BIFYPWK|5|I am very happy with two Twenty8Twelve tee products that I have and will buy more.  Their designs are unique, and the fabrics are soft and comfortable.  Fits true to size.  I have worn this tee under a grey business suit to work and with jeans on weekends.  I get compliments all the time on it. No complaints.  Recommend purchase.
B001AERR56|4|Got this hat about 3 weeks ago and very pleased with it.Perfect fit great looking and stylish.Have not tested its water resiststance or crushability yet.A lady stopped me on the street and wanted to know where I go it, said her husband had been looking for one for some time.The Indy pin on the band  is not to my liking but is rather small and shouldn't be very noticeble. Love it.
B00JUCK26G|4|It is a pretty dress as most Lily Pulitzer dresses, but it fit small. My child is size10 -12, and this one was pretty short and tied.
B006KXVLPO|5|Super cute leggings for little boys- though my husband disagrees. He still thinks they're cute.
B00IVB5HDK|4|fits good came in mail within 3 days
B007RGG8U6|5|These are super comfortable and very lightweight!  I love them.  I got them for pajamas and they are perfect.  I'm considering getting the darker grey ones too just cause they are so cool looking.  Great for loungewear too.  They are totally soft.
B00MOP23I6|5|Very nice
B00CAVDQS0|5|great top and good price great quality looks great even after several washes!
B001CROPEW|5|I got a lot of compliments at work with this dress. The best part is that it was easy to wash and it does not fade, not to mention comfortable. A MUST HAVE. Sinajana, Guam
B00VQJRIMW|5|use as a top
B00NAX1GFW|1|Runs small to size. Thin material not for cold months. Looks cheap.<br />I would not recommend for a quality item.
B00HI9LG1I|4|Looks cute  on me every time I wear it.
B00GNGM9JK|5|We have tried this on the baby although he will not wear it till halloween. The colors are great, the material is super soft and we are very pleased with  the  fit
B004Y9Q1RY|4|I like these leggins from Levi's for Women, the quality and craftmanship are excellent, but I am sending them back.  I purchased a pair of women's and a pair of junior's 535 legging jeans to see which ones would fit better and I have to say the junior ones did.<br /><br />I am a woman in my mid 30's, with an athletic body, large calves, large thighs and a big bottom.  I didn't think the juniors would fit, but they did and look better.  The junior sizes have a lower waist and the bum area in the back is lower too.  But I have a large bum and even I was surprised it fit back there and there was no gap.  It was nice and tight.  The women's one have a higher waist in the front, not mom jean's high, but higher than the juniors, which creates a longer torso.  The problem is that with the longer front, the zipper area creates \\"air pockets\\" in both sides of the zipper which in turn makes your front look like a certain animal from the dessert's toe.  LOL  Because the junior ones have a shorter waistline, the zipper takes up most of the front area, therefore pulling the front nicely looking flush and appropriate! You might not run into this problem if you have slim thighs, but if you have chunky thighs like I do, you will notice it right away.<br /><br />Other than a fit problem, the quality of these leggings was excellent!
B00FQA97Z8|5|5 stars for good for electro play & a great sensation. That being said, I think they're kind of overpriced. They are essentially just (really nice quality) black gloves with grommet style tacks glued on the inside with the 4 pokey parts sticking out all over the gloves. I understand this is probably a mom & pop company & I really do love them, just think they're a bit overpriced. Overall, good product.
B000HZXY4W|5|These socks are for you if you get cold feet in the winter.  Very comfortable, warm and worth the price.
B00CEH2EQK|5|Finally! Some underwear that fit like they're supposed to!
B00MGJDNGG|5|LOVE THESE!! they are not only cut but VERY comfortable!
B00I9V1JAW|2|The socks are made with really poor quality.
B00DTQJD1E|4|my boy liked it so much & its really good quality, but its kinda heavy<br />at all nice one :)
B00JTUEWSS|5|My girl is coming to 3 years old however she is on the petite side so I have ordered size 2T instead of 3T and it fits her just right.<br />The colour fushia is true to the picture and material is soft and comfortable.
B00PZY5P4M|5|Fast shipping great product will re-order
B001AKB54E|4|as advertised
B000Q7ESQY|5|Excellent!!!!
B002A933EE|5|Nice patch, good quality but in my case as I reviewed other patches I used them to personalize my suitcase, so in my case I used some fabric glue around the edges as I could not use the iron on the inside of the suitcase.
B001JBDATM|3|They were good and the size was good. The only problem is that they are a bit big, not on the waste though. it's not a size issue I think it's design
B00QYCN9SI|5|Good
B0043RI0IU|3|District 12!!!!
B003MWCOLG|5|Very comfortable.
B00076ZRFA|3|fabric quality is not that good. but can wear at home.
B00CRXSOO2|5|Bought this to silk screen for a client. Fit perfectly, and looks cool, too!
B002HJ2QRW|5|Excellent fit as well as an excellent purchase.
B0035WTMF4|4|I bought this for horseback riding ( posting the trot and cantering can be a very bouncy experience if you have anything bigger than an A cup and you are on a saddle seat friesian) .  I tried them all, regardless of price.  I love that the straps are adjustable. The bounce is 95% controlled even on my champion mover!  Comfortable enough to wear for the entire show day.
B00PFAKN52|4|They were a little smaller than I expected, but still fit him.  He really likes the colors.  I wish they had more in stock for size 16 and I wish there were larger sizes for boys.  My little guy is 10 and at the top of the sizes.  They are very soft.  Washed up nicely.  He says they do not give him a wedgie like some of the others he has, so that's a plus.
B000NQISMI|4|Wife and I love it.
B00DTWZQFK|5|First off, I am very partial to any clothing that's purple.  I've bought AC product before; I was sure this purchase would fit and meet my expectations: and it did.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />David
B00IUC1BGM|5|Love ths outfit
B00880B1XE|3|I like the belt but the color of the brown belt and the coffee belt were the same color - more of a dark tan. I can't use it for the outfit I bought it for. The delivery took almost 8 weeks.
B00O9WVFOA|1|Cheap construction, not worth even the low cost
B003ICZRHS|3|Very lovely mask - wore it for a masquerade wedding. However, the feathers are very delicate. By the end of the night, most of the peacock feathers fell off.
B0095UXHKG|5|I have a rather tall young son who has outgrown all the 'footie' jammies available for kids. I ordered this in a men's small-he typically wears a Youth Large.<br />It's roomy, warm, and cozy. He LOVES it. Totally worth the price.
B00BZ5XPT2|3|I bought a large according to the size chart. I usually wear a size ten. It was quite snug, not comfortable. I also was not a fan of the things on the shoulders. They looked like inside out shoulder pads. If they had had it in an XL I probably would have reordered in the larger size and jazzed up the shoulder pads. Overall, I did like the style, just not the fit.
B00F6A2USO|2|These were completely see-threw once you did a squat. Since they are workout pants, I figured they would not be see-threw when I did a exercise. They are worth maybe ten dollars at most.
B001G96FYY|5|I have worn these each summer and absolutely will not go to the beach without them.  I ordered two--black and white--will order more to go with every outfit.  Incidentally, they make good summer head-bands.
B003CMWX0S|5|I purchased these for my husband who wears them round the house as slippers. He LOVES them. I'll be getting more!!!
B0026746KU|5|Nice shorts. You might catch lint often with this, though, especially if you have the black one. But it appears durable.
B003WIFM0A|2|I ordered the XXXL which is to fit up to 56\\" chest. My groomsman I ordered it for has a 54\\" chest and the XXXL didn't even come close to closing around him. Also, the tie was not included.<br /><br />The quality of the vest was nice for the price but not something that you could wear for more than few times without it showing. But since this is for a wedding it would work nicely.
B00ECUG1TS|5|fits just right. Nice looking jacket.
B00EH6TWV6|3|Perfect for playing up the wild side of things.  very sexy.  The con is it stretches out somewhat and feels like it should be a bit tighter but overall this was a good buy.
B007PHKQPU|4|Good scrubs to buy on limited budged. The fabric feels synthetic and rough to touch and after being washed many times the quality of fabric did not change. With multiple washings the product continues to look fairly new.
B005GYGEXC|3|These pants are so comfortable! I wear them all the time. I bought them to workout in, but they've become my lounging pants more than anything. My only complaint on the fit is that they seemed a little loose in the waist because they sag a little when I'm working out, but I'm not sure I would necessarily want them tighter. The fit was otherwise as expected. I wear a 12 pants and I got the large and they were perfect. I've purchased these pants twice and both pairs ripped on the inner thigh seam. I was hoping the first time was a fluke, because I like the fit and they're comfy, but after the second time it's time for me to find a new comfy yoga pant.
B006MS3TZC|3|Its very expensive for what it is.<br />I dont like how it fits me, iots very loose.<br /> Buy something similar that cost half the price.
B00ATXF9UY|4|I ordered a 26 in which I'm a true 26. They fit with no room for shrinking after wash.  They run a little small so you may want to go up one size. These are some cute crop jeans and the outer wax coating makes them look glossy and feel<br /> thick.  I have already ordered another pair in the blue in a larger size.  At this price you are getting high quality jeans and would recommend them to others.
B00LCKETYK|5|It fit perfectly,I enjoying wearing it,my friends like it,it's a nice t shirt to have! I'll tell everybody to get one.
B00XIX3NAU|5|My husband loves it. Its light weight and cool.
B00I2V0TBE|4|I am a 5,3 ,125 pounds teenage girl I got the medium one. The top part fit well but the bottom part was a bit baggy in the front and back. But over all it's a pretty good swim suit. Can't wait to use it in Hawaii!
B00FHK79D4|4|Got nice complements.  Wears as photo shows.  Good sizing - fits nicely.
B003R7LD5O|4|My wife thinks their Great so far like the texture of the sock is what she thought but haven't had chance to utilize.
B008X1INKM|4|The color is pretty. It is a bit of small around the arms area.  I wish that the vendor prewash the cloth.  Overall I am pretty happy with it.
B00W2Q0LE0|2|ordered womans xl but it fits like it may be at least a medium. not sure what the fit will be like once its washed, it may be a one time wear item
B00TO9UE90|5|thank u
B00LGCDC6A|1|When I put these pants on, I had major muffin hip.  When I pulled them up to get rid of muffin hip, I got camel toe.  The rise is too short unless you are rail thin, and the waistband is only about 1/2&#34; wide, not nearly sufficient to lay flat without cutting into the hips.  For point of reference, I am 5'7&#34;, 150 lbs, size Medium in most stuff, or a size 8.  Not a big girl.  These pants were definitely not flattering on my body.  Since they took a month to be shipped from China, there was no returning them.  They went into the Goodwill pile.  Total waste of my money. :(
B00AO840BI|5|Not sure what else can I say... the straps haven't broken so far, can be washed like regular clothes, don't over expand over time. If you're looking for straps, well, these are straps.<br />The only thing I would change are the heart shapes, but it's just a detail.
B00E1LAOPU|3|this blouse runs small it has to be for a teen,
B00KOIEC98|3|These pajama pants were a little too short for me even though I am petite, 5'1''. They worked fine as pajama pants but they were a little thin though.
B005LKPX5Q|3|The quality is great but the item runs very small. I would recommend a review in the sizing of the visor.
B00O3WBWVC|5|Husband loved it! Good fit, not to big under the arms! Loved the decal but would love to have the big decal on the back with smallér decal to front. Over all quality well worth the cost!
B004M6UDC8|3|It is a black wallet it holds money and cards. that is all I required. the zipper makes it more secure.
B00HHV5L6S|4|The transaction was ideal and the item is great.
B001J56CAC|5|I have three of these vests, each in a different color.  The quality and look won me over, as did the cut.  In this world of small-medium-large sizing, it can be difficult to find something that fits right if your between sizes.  Paul Frederick vests are generous enough in cut to avoid having to round your size up, preventing that sloppy, too-big look.  The styling and quality of the vests are great - sturdy and classic in every way.  I now buy PF vests of any style without concern about quality or fit quality.  They are consistently the best that I have found, and priced within reason.
B000P0B5TA|5|Perfect size  very comfortable!
B00A9VE3JO|5|very sexy
B000U61VL6|4|the pouch is good. i have a ipaq 6945 and fits comfortably into it. the belt clip is awesome. it has a option of lopping the belt thru it and also buckling it to belt. all in worth the money. Go for it.
B00FYF922I|1|everything is great except the color, which must match the scrub bottoms; I bought the Dickies Gen Flex Youtility scrub bottoms in color &#34;wine&#34;; this top is also called &#34;wine&#34; but it is not. It is purple, not maroon. I'm pissed. I start tomorrow and I don't have a respectable uniform. Thank you Dickies.
B00G4GL6D4|4|I got it for a hard to buy for co-worker for Christmas.  Glad I did because she really liked it!
B00NGHPFA4|5|Bought them as a gift they were true to color
B00194HEBO|5|Material is really soft, and fits well. This is my brand going forward for this product. Nice assortment of colors.
B00AARJRFW|5|Very good price compared to scrub store. Love all the pockets. First pair of scrub pants I didn't have to hem. Nice material.
B00ARZBKP2|5|I have,purchased Olga's panties over the last 30 years.  This Last purchase is like the first purchase......more than exceptional! I will continue to purchase Olga panties in the future!
B00NP6DFGW|4|I love the style and this definitely kept my feet warm and toasty. However,  it fits very strangely.  It is too tight around the toes yet too big around the heels.  With each step, my heels tended to pop out of them. Having said that,  i got used to it after a day or two and have no regrets purchasing them.
B001KG0KAS|5|Very comfortable and have went through several washes and still look good!
B00JC10VZW|5|I couldn't think of a reason not to give 5 stars. This gown IS cuter than the picture, with burgandy gro-grain (sp?) ribbons for straps (they're adjustable). The length hits me mid-thigh -I'm 5'8&#34;. The plaid pattern is youthful - looking and the lace and satin ribbon trim is very nice.
B00005LILM|5|This wig was perfect. it looks great and had a great price to match. Great for any male pirate costume or could be a females as well.
B00XJ1Y2SS|3|Loved the way it looked but it was SO big - and I wear an 8.5 women's foot so I don't even have small feet. Being too big, it didn't lay right, then broke.
B007S9JKYS|5|i bought this for a shadow box but i forgot how small they were. my mistake though otherwise great product
B00QEKYZS8|5|I am about 173lbs and I orederd a large and the dress fits perfectly...I was a bit concerned when I saw that the us tag says medium and the Asia says large...but when I tried it on I had no issues...can't wait to wear this dress for my birthday in two weeks time....I would highly recommend this dress
B00KQMJ6Z2|3|A fun costume. Reasonable quality for the price, but a bit hard to get on without help for the lacing.
B00PR317DY|1|Not happy at all..I expected a better quality for the amount of money!!!
B00GKCADBS|4|To prevent sunburn and possible skin cancer
B0060S0J1G|5|It is everything I expected & more. It's comfortable, looks great, & cute. And it's cozy & warm. I purchased it through Amazon because their prices are great!!
B00H7PVI7K|3|This scarf is as pictured, but the length is awkward.  When wrapped around once, as pictured, it is much longer than the photo shows, and it looks awkward from the side (I'm pretty short, though!) However, it's too short to wrap around 3 times.  Also, it is very bulky in the back, and I cannot seem to get it to lie flat.
B005BNJ322|1|I am a 46 year old psychologist. These are most likely great jeans if I was a 20-something rap artist. I can't stress enough how poorly these fit. For the love of all that is Holy, do not order these if you are not an urban youth under the age of 25. These just suck.
B00GT3AMSW|3|This beanie is almost exactly as the seller describes. It is a good size, is slouchy, and is very comfortable. I rate three stars simply because it is not a purple beanie. This is a dark red/burgundy colored beanie, which was an inconvenience, but other than the off-putting color, it is a very nice beanie. Would recommend if you want a burgundy slouchy beanie.
B00E4PMLAE|5|I love it, the plush feels like fur, very soft and comfy.Fits great (L) Love the color, and I'm sure I can wear it in the morning also. ; )  Shipping was 2 days ahead of time. Great buy!!
B00J6AT20Y|5|Nice shirt
B00JTEQ74Q|5|I ordered 3 of these dresses. I did size up and glad I did. Looks exactly like pictures. Comfortable and perfect for summer. Its a little sheer but see through.
B005LCE8C8|5|Great bag for my sports.
B004D2RK9A|5|Very comfy and warm.
B004OA7QYA|5|We love these, we have bought a few of other brands and in comparison, price/quality/features the Disney Cuddly Bodysuits are the best.<br /><br />It's true what others mention regarding the strange snap by the armpit, which we have found other brands avoid, but for us it's not such a big deal, after a couple of times using them you get used to it. And having the double row of snaps to allow for growth is a major plus.<br /><br />We highly recommend them, I wish they had long sleeved ones too.
B004S9G6TS|5|I received this top fast, and was very impressed with it.<br />It looks gorgeous! And the price is very very good. If you are undecided, please buy it! You will be impressed!<br />This is the lowest price I have seen!
B0081Y5UIE|5|I love it, I love it!<br />It's fun, but  not necessarily childish .  Great for partying on the beach or pool area, or just 'cues you feel like it!
B00J8T7Z7U|5|A great way of saying I was proud to serve.  Quality hat that fits comfortably.
B009NO3LHS|5|I bought this for my son who was in a wedding at 5-6 months....just used it again for his 2yr pictures! Great quality and everyone gives me so many complements on it!
B0091VVKIU|2|Cheap material..i would not purchasethis again.
B00BAKWEMG|4|A bit overpriced but good quality and a medium fit me great. (I consider myself an average size 160 lbs. Okay maybe a little gordita)
B00KJ9XKRW|5|very nice
B00BRB22UM|5|LOVE the fabric.  It is SOOOO soft!!!
B00X3ICJ28|5|The dress arrived quickly and in good condition. I'm 5'4&#34;, 160 lbs., and the large fits me perfectly. I paired it with black tights and boots and it looks great! It's my new favorite dress.
B00BSE6UYC|5|My girlfriend and I are going to Hawaii and so we needed to update our swimwear. You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find a good swimsuit! While I didn't need to do much searching for my own, it was hard to find a women's swimsuit that had that vintage-inspired style my girlfriend loves. But then voila! I stumbled upon this 50s Pin Up swimsuit. Not only is it stylish, it's super well-made. She's already thinking about getting other colors/patterns.
B00PAIQKYM|4|Highly recommended for petite lady like 5'2&#34; or shorter.
B00SW1OJII|5|I wear it as a tunic dress and I have received a lot of compliments on it.
B00BWKK5FC|5|Very nice dress.  Tried it on right away when it arrived at work.  My coworkers really liked it.  Purchased it for a wedding, but decided on another dress instead.  I wear a size 6, but actually went up a size to accommodate for my rear :).
B009QD1H2W|5|This scarf feels really nice to the touch.  The scarf is warm and looks great.  My girl friend loves it and takes it from me all the time.
B001DPL3IY|2|My fault - I didn't realize these tights were chocolate brown - thought they were black.  I returned them and was happy with the service I received.
B00JM9SLEW|3|Listened to the reviews and ordered my shirt size instead of my normal coat/jacket size. The sleeve length is just fine, but the chest is very tight. My only other complaint is the zipper. It's tinny! Impossible to operate with any type of glove on and after wearing the coat for only about a week it has started separating from the bottom each time I bend or sit. (I'm not fat if that's what your thinking, 69&#34; 155#) it's warm and dry and the pockets are conveniently placed just very odd fitting and the zipper is very cheap.
B00OFUAUEC|4|I was very happy with the hoodie that came. it came earlier than The delivery date and the fabric was wonderful its not cheap at all and a little thick. I weigh 145 pounds, I'm 5,4 I got s/m and it fits great I should've got a M/L but I don't mind it because it is a crop top. The reason I gave it four stars and not five is because I recived it stained in the back, it's okay cause I could probably just wash it but next time I feel they should just put it in
B006AH20HI|4|Good quality and soft but arm length was somewhat short.
B005442A0K|5|Love it!
B004DNWN3C|4|i am wearing my silky sheer pantyhose and feel nice and pretty pantyhose. i like no nonsense pantyhose for my all day pantyhose but, i love my hanes pantyhose and nylons, they are very sheer pantyhose for a sexy look but very long wear pantyhose that hold up all day in my pantyhose, i wear high heel pumps and pantyhose all day and pumps can wear my pantyhose down, reinforced pantyhose toes help, my pantyhose can be sheer pantyhose and pantyhose for all day pantyhose wear on my nylon pantyhose but, if i pull up reinforced toes pantyhose and hanes pantyhose has lots of reinforced toe pantyhose to pull from, i like sheer toe pantyhose but they run more. if i wear sheer toes pantyhose i take my pumps off my pantyhose feet, i find it hard, very hard in the morning. to pull my favorite pantyhose up, i have so many kinds of pantyhose and nylons on my sheer pantyhose but, hanes sheer pantyhose are one of my new favorite pantyhose.
B001R2IVP6|4|I ordered the ceil blue, but has more of a purple hue than my other ceil blue scrubs by different brands.  Can't mix and match with them. Unnoticeable as a set with the Dickies pants, though.
B005CSOHDG|5|Delivery was fast, and the pants I received look exactly the same as those in the picture & were the right size that I asked for, very pleased.
B004J008TU|3|Bought it online because no car at the time.. cheaper in stores though... but good quality item
B00DUTXGN6|5|Beautiful, well designed coat that truly flatters. I bought this coat in a size 14 because it runs a little small, especially if you want to wear anything with any bulk, like a sweater. I usually would purchase a size 10, but I am a 36DD so I needed the extra room.  The fabric is soft and luxurious and does not add weight. Best purchase in coats that I ever made.
B006YK1P0Y|4|My daughter (age 4) was nervous about the toe seam so she turned one inside out right away.  From toe to heal on both sides were a lot of extra thread from the process of sewing the sock together.  I had to take a scissors and trim each sock... A lot of extra work I wasn't planning on.  She has successfully worn the socks, but I'm worried about how they will hold up in the wash now.  I'm not sure if this was only in our socks or if they are manufactured in such a way that this happens.  Wish I would have known about these extra threads before I ordered them.
B00WITZI4Y|1|Thin material
B00GGAGWYQ|5|My granddaughter was adorable wearing her new swim suit! Love it.
B006BHSF6M|4|cute
B002ZNM7ZG|5|These stockings are a very good quality and fit nicely without bagging or ankle wrinkles!  I have them in several shades and all have been as advertised.  Shipping was on time.
B003XT6ZGI|5|My husband loves these!
B009QTK09M|3|Cute, but made with scratchy fabric. The little jacket-like wrap is okay to look at, but doesn't stay on your shoulders because it doesn't have seams in the right places. Would get a similar item, but not this one specifically.
B00WJOSZXY|5|It fit beautifully! Very flattering, cute and feminine. I wrote this to my bridal shower and got so many compliments!
B004303O56|2|Love this light switch cover...super heavy, made well..the only problem? It doesn't fit!! Have tried on several different light switches..no dice. Bummed.
B00GSFZVGE|5|These fit great as long as you tie them on your waist, otherwise if you tie them on your hips they might fall as the fabric is slippery
B00EOHZEKG|4|The material is nice and it fits nicely. Loved the price. Got it on sale.  Will buy more of this brand.
B00A2I6I0Q|1|I received these today and I have been anxiously waiting for them so I could go running without my hands freezing. I was really disappointed when I put them on. First of all, I ordered a medium and they are not just a little too small, but WAY too small. And I don't have big hands by any means. I have pretty small hands. These &#34;Medium&#34; sized WOMENS gloves look like they could fit my 11 year old nieces hands.<br /><br />THEN there's the thickness, you would think that &#34;Running Sport Gloves&#34; would be thin spandex/fleece combo. These are bulky, chunky, thick and definitely not something I would wear out to go running. I foresee my hands being all kinds of nasty-sweaty in these.<br /><br />Definitely returning!!
B00BNBB6OO|5|Great bra
B00G2S1A9Y|5|Love this shirt.  Have to rep one of the coolest movies ever.
B00I932MLU|5|good quality and an adhesive strip that so far hods well
B0060QUI5A|5|This dress is absolutely GORGEOUS! My daughter loves it. It for my beach wedding & it will go just GREAT!
B005CDYVM8|1|Just tights!!! NOT low-rise, not leggings, not jeggings.....just tights. And over priced! Seriously. Just tights.
B00CKHYP20|5|Gorgeous sweater, love the fit!
B00XLPSI0U|5|I can't say enough good about this product. I've only had 2 pair of shorts from RBX and they are my two favorite pair of shorts. Thanks RBX for great, quality products!
B00841L83K|4|I was pleasantly surprised by this dress.  I am 5ft 4in and wasn't sure how the length would be.  It sits just a few inches from my ankles which is perfect to wear with flip flops.  I am a pretty large breasted girl and this covered a lot more tan I thought it would (normally I spill out of the armpit and cleavage areas)!  It leaves a nice cleavage line showing without being TOO revealing.  It is flowy and drapes nicely. Not clingy at all.
B00NNWNOPA|5|Got for my grandson who loves Captain America. He absolutely loves them!!!
B00NQB5CA8|2|I returned this item. I didn't realize from the pictures that there is a lot of glitter in there. Also, I couldn't wear this even without the glitter because it makes me itch like crazy (though I have to admit I'm somewhat sensitive in that regard).
B009HAKX0G|1|These pants look great when they are brand new they fit tight and snug but after a few hours wear they fit TERRIBLE, they totally lose their shape and become a whole size too big, I will have to have them altered . I tried washing them in hot water but still the same problem .<br /><br />The fabric is very very soft and the design on the fabric is cute so a real bummer they don't hold their shape. I wish I could return them as they look ridiculous now. Just one star for the softness.
B0013XWDEE|5|These sports bras are perfect for me.  I am very small chested, but do need something for when I am working out.  Most sports bras feel suffocating to me and they aren't soft and cottony enough for my sensitive skin.  I just bought another pack for my almost 13 year old daughter who couldn't fit into any of the kids bras at Old Navy after trying every style.  The straps weren't long enough or comfortable for her and when the straps fit the cup size was too large.  I had her try on one of mine and they fit perfect. Now she will have something comfortable to wear for sports and P.E. classes at school.  So glad I found these!
B003ITAFMS|4|This isn't a bad little field kit to have on hand for backup. Compact and after adding a few cleaning stars, fits nicely in the BOB.
B00T9SISUI|4|Came in time and looks good for the price.
B00HNOH2WK|3|Somewhat small, not too thick
B00DRBMTK8|5|a
B001QDJ33A|5|buena tela buena calidad, llego al tiempo acordado, muy responsable, el detalle del puma en relieve es excelente, recomiendo la tienda y el producto, lo volvería a comprar
B00IXJFCEY|5|I haven't purchased another nursing bra yet, but I'm very happy with this one. It's comfortable & functional, & fit perfectly. I'm currently a 34C & the medium is exactly right.
B0037TSMQA|5|Pardon the title. Anyways the hoodies sizes are as followed-SIZE SMALL - WIDTH/CHEST 19\\", LENGTH/SHOULDER TO HIP 26\\" SIZE MEDIUM - WIDTH/CHEST 20\\", LENGTH/SHOULDER TO HIP 27\\" SIZE LARGE - WIDTH/CHEST 21\\", LENGTH/SHOULDER TO HIP 28\\"      The fabric is very soft and warm. It has two pockets on the front( Just big enough for your hands.)    It could work for cosplay purposes.  Personally I'd highly advise taking it out in the rain. The material would soak water up.  Also the design on the hood(The eyes) are printed on. It looks like it wouldn't survive a round with the dryer.      As for uses outside cosplay it will turn heads. It's unisex, but if your around a crowd that knows anime a guy should avoid wearing it.     Seeing as I'm the only one who's either taken the time to make a review or maybe the only one who bought feel free to comment on the review if you have questions.
B00Q82HKVQ|4|pretty
B00SCANF7A|4|Just be ready to iron it for thirty minutes (with low heat on top of a thin towel; it's rayon) because, like mine, it'll have more wrinkles/creases than a bird's got feathers... Haha! :)
B006Z94L8C|5|Great!
B00LMPZNAE|5|Really love it, very pleased!
B002QQ7TNW|5|Have worn these nightgowns for years. Love them.  However I do believe the fabric is thinner than it used to be.
B00F2CLVHW|3|Not very comfortable.  Fit a little larger than i would like
B009MRU2LY|4|The shirt wasnt the exact ine pictured. It didnt have eddie also on the back just all black reqding The Number Of The Beast. But still very happy with it.
B00L3T682Q|5|I thought i was gonna be a lol more loose than I expected. It small but fits me perf
B00BEAK348|4|I wore the sweatshirt in a St Patrick's Day parade this year. I was driving a 70' Red & White Mercury Convertible with the top down. It was chilly so the sweatshirt felt good  through out the parade. I completed the outfit with a green top hat. I will most likely wear it next year in the parade. I liked the hooded sweatshirt. I will say if you wear a medium (I do), get a large. I got a large and it fit well over my tee shirt.
B0075CO06Q|5|This is a well made, sturdy, high quality fishnet shirt that will last a long time.  The sleeves are a nice length, very stretchy, and the fishnet holes fit easily over fingers to hold the sleeves in place.  I have this in both black and white and love both colors for different occasions. Because it is very stretchy, you can adjust the neckline to fit high or stretched over your shoulders.  Versatile and fun wardrobe piece great for layering!
B0087NB8VC|5|i got a 2x and they fit really good but around the butt they were a little tight but they stretched out after some moving around! they're super cute also:)
B00F2YSAE2|3|Nice socks but they shrink too much I wear a size 11 and have trouble putting them on at times
B000NPYKQM|5|I had large breasts before I got pregnant.  Now, they're just plain huge.  Almost 3 months into breastfeeding, I am all boob.  I have been wearing a bra night and day since the day my son was born, and thank goodness for this bra.  It supports more than any other bra I've tried (I have 5 others).  I also have the bravado original, and it's great too, but sometimes you don't want that \\"sports bra\\" look.  This bra has been perfect for that.  It's the only bra I wear when I leave the house and know I'll actually be around people besides my family!  :)
B00IOV0EEO|4|It is quite long and wide, but can be double around to give extra warmth.  Nice and soft...
B00DIWYKGW|1|Sorry I ordered this skirt as much as I like the skirt the sizing couldn't be further from the truth. I wear a 12/14 and never had a problem buying wrap around skirts as a matter of fact it is the reason why I buy them. However this skirt must have been made for a size 2.  I was very disappointed, I gave the skirt to my instructor who is a size you guessed it a size 2.  Never again.
B006UTJDN0|5|Nice leather wallet, very durable and roomy. Looks expensive! Spacious, several slots for credit cards, check book, coins and reciepts! Can also be used as a clutch for dressy and casual affairs.
B000B7BZEM|3|The emblem needs work does not look right.
B003E1RRCG|5|This item came quick, within a couple of days it was hear. I like the material of this hat, and the protection that it gives. I have not used it yet, but it feels like I could trust this hat if I was in the middle of the Safari desert.
B00H86E668|4|Pros:  Comfortable; snug without being too tight; adequate support for all day wear and for exercising/athletics<br /><br />Cons:  Thin material, relatively high price<br /><br />I will be buying another soon, perhaps even 5 more.
B005QR770S|1|The touchscreen technology feature stopped working after 3 months. Perfect for one season, but don't expect these to last past one winter.
B00CPR45IE|5|These collar stays are perfect since they fit all my shirts as well as not falling out as much as the smoother metal types.
B00HJ1Q4VC|5|Runs small.  You should order 2 sizes up.  Shirt is nice and well made.
B00FKDDJ8W|5|Literally got this for bad hair days. Fits like all my others but the &#34;brim&#34; is just a little thick so it bothers my ears sometimes. But it doesn't stop me from wearing it.
B005A0X1E2|5|This was a good buy. They are really nice.
B00I1LOLIM|5|My son loves it
B002OSQ0KK|5|baby shower decoration and it is an umbrella so it is what it is, hard to mess up an umbrella
B00LGKU5IA|5|Nice sleeveless jacket. The zipper is on the opposite side though, and the nip pockets arent actually pockets. Pretty cool though, doesnt feel cheap.
B00AQDAGFK|5|This dress is very nice, but.run too small, i am goin ro buy another one with one size up , i orderes 3t but will be better i ordered 4t, it fit perct to my baby but in few weeks it wont fit her. But quality is perfect and colors
B0056WQXGC|5|She loves pink and this is exceptionally pink.  It was a WOW at the party.  She is so excited to have it this year.
B00IMX5ABQ|5|Not as comfy as I'd like but comfy enough!
B00G3N9SZG|1|I can't wear the top it is so tiny, and add to that there is no way to return it because there are no return instructions.  My first disappointment with any Amazon article.  I am out the money and not a happy customer for the first time.  Also the other top I ordered has never arrived.  What's up with that!!! I was notified it was shipped.  Must be coming VIA stage coach.<br />Donna Deibel,
B000KGKBOY|5|It's very warm and rugged, I would recommend buying carhartt to anyone, afordable and totally worth it. Buy it buy it
B00ICT27L6|5|These are the most comfortable pants I've ever had
B00PX539YG|5|I loved the print... The fit was wonderful thanks!
B001MXGSEQ|5|It fit just perfect. I'm 5'6&#34; and 170lbs.  It was very comfortable.
B004GZO9ZW|5|Perfect for all size heads, since it's adjustable  - and you can take it anywhere.  Nice for hot climates, too.
B00T0H9VMC|3|My 13 year old son loves his shirt, but the Med definitely fit more like a small or xsmall. Very lightweight material and no printing on the back.
B0099YILQ8|5|beautiful costume, well constructed and worth the price. Cant wait to wear for halloween
B008OH768K|4|The UN9 cotton long john fits great.  The only issue I have is that the material is extremely thin and the seat split the first time that I wore them.  I'm sure they can be sewn up and be fine.  Despite this little issue, I still like them.  These long johns are extremely comfortable under my jeans and would recommend them to anyone.
B00M4919GE|3|This product is nice for the price I paid. The only problem I have with it is that other reviews said that it ran small. I ended up getting the size I would normally wear. Instead of small it ended up being too big. Sadly...
B00O8SJDXA|5|Better than I expected
B008RPMOZE|5|excellent product, I recommend
B00D6QMQKC|5|great jacket
B000YQNUL6|5|It is so comfortable, I can't tell I'm wearing anything!
B00BBXEAXI|4|The fit is about what you would expect it to be...but it doesn't dry fast enough for my taste. Looks good on.  I bought the lime green and it isn't neon, but it is a vibrant color.<br /><br />All in all,a good purchase.
B008EQQKE2|5|My 6 year old loves them!
B00EGSTF4E|5|Perfect. Just like the picture. Great quality!
B000U64MAI|5|I purchased many Russell items over the years and have never been disappointed.  The Russell Athletic Men's Fleece Open Bottom Pants are no exception.  The pants are a quality product.  The pockets are a great feature.  The leg length will have to be hemmed to fit.  The pants are comfortable.  I wear them frequently and really enjoy them.  I highly recommend these pants.  UPDATE TWO YEAR LATER - October, 2011.  These Russell pants are just amazing.  I wear them every day.  They have had countless washings over the past two years.  They are very comfortable and just seem to last, and last, and last.  After two years of heavy use, I still enthusiastically  recommend these pants.
B009DRH5S6|4|I ordered these to use as part of a mermaid costume. They looked great.
B0010W5BP6|4|Fit simply flawless, perfect contour, comfortable. Fits great with or without straps, smooth look under clothes. it was everything I expected.
B00KY55OK2|4|quality printing on item - good fit if you are a small person<br />(one size does NOT fit most) - shipping time too long, but<br />product worth it
B000PQJW12|5|Fits perfectly.
B004R8PLAU|5|These Jeans are sized well and fit really good. Inseam runs a little long but that is much better than too short. My husband loves them.
B006G9G9Q8|5|Very cute. My daughter loves the shiny stones around the flower. Both the quality and style are great. It fits her perfectly.
B008SD4N7M|4|The dress was very lovely.  It did run a bit small and shorter than expected.
B007ZIM41I|5|Awesome item +rep with Good seller
B00JDTRD9U|5|I am a size 12 and this fits great through the top. Be sure to wash it before you wear it. The dyes will leach out into the water.<br />Perfect for summer wear. Love the colors. Great value for the price.
B005JR7D90|5|I bought this dress in the 3-6 month size. It is absolutely adorable! The dress looks just like the picture. It's a great buy for a fancy occasion.
B00RUE3Y4S|5|I ordered several thongs and these are my favorite so far!
B00FSY43DS|5|Shipping was on time. Jacket fits perfect.
B00M0H7RFM|4|This was super cute! I ordered for a Star Wars themed party and it was a hit. The material is a little thin, but overall it's a great novelty shirt. Remember that is a junior's size when ordering, and go for a size up.
B00MV4ZD0K|5|Nice product great quality and my wife liked it. It was a nice piece for her wardrobe.
B00GLL8WRK|4|Super tight. Weird fabric. Sleeves a bit short, but OK om the whole.
B00HALXZ0E|5|Looks great!
B00B4X3586|5|I AM VERY HAPY WITH THE SHIRT.  IT WAS AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED AND THE FIT WAS PERFECT. COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT ON MAUI JOHN OF MAUI
B00A832JHG|5|loved it, comfortable
B004D2RKG8|5|Love this robe, worth the money and wears well. It's a warm cuddle when it's cold and soft! LOVE IT!
B00M2QYIIU|1|It was of poor quality
B00FSK525K|5|I have not been a big fan of slinky knits and prefer to wear natural fibers, but I am sold on this fabric. This jacket is a beautiful Royal Blue and hangs on the body in a slimming silhouette. The length covers the back end and stops at the right spot so it doesn't wear me.<br />This is a type of slinky/jersey knit that doesn't reveal body flaws. It hides them well! I have purchased other Jostar clothes and they have all been a great addition to my wardrobe.
B006JVF26Q|3|I am trying to find a cute outfit to take my son home in from the hospital and this is advertised as \\"newborn...\\" well there are three sizes so one would assume that \\"small\\" is \\"newborn\\" It's 0-3 and looks pretty big...kinda bummed.
B0083BVFO8|5|I love these and will purchase these again when I need more.
B007X7W95M|4|This is a nice jacket. Keep in mind that its a bit thin though and definitely for casual wear versus formal wear. Overall the jacket fits nicely over the top of your shoulders and fits snugly over your midsection (the way the jacket was designed). If your not into slim fit jackets you should go in a different direction but overall this jacket is well worth the price.<br /><br />As always you'll want to be sure on sizing before you order.<br /><br />Cheers.
B008US8TAC|3|The upper was loss, but perfect on hips and lower belly.  Took too long for shipment.and<br /> I bought small size for 115 bounds
B00AK3ZFG6|4|Really like these shorts, just a little bit of stretch makes them nice and comfortable.
B00S8OTBXW|5|an upgrade over the original buckle that came with the belt. The white buckle turned yellow from the sunlight.
B000NRV95U|5|Fits good and looks good. The color is very pretty. I recommend it, being that it is so comfortable.
B00DC3IRGG|5|I loved this top! It looks more orange then red but it look absoutly amazinf with a white shirt! I loved it! Be mindful that it fits a little snug BUT I have washed it MANY times and it hasn't shrunk!!
B005BTGUY0|5|It is perfect an fit as expected...Good Price and good product. I love it. I love Oakley products thanks a lot
B00CJ55HG6|4|Was a little bigger than it should have been for the size but it is so adorable!<br />Mother fell in love with the dress. So cute in person!!
B007N7B9J4|1|After few months of using it starts to lose the color, and lenses starts to turn black... not sure if I still have warranty
B001EB3JL6|4|I was nervous about ordering these scrubs for my husband because they were less than half the price of any others we found.  However, these seem to be the same quality as their more expensive counterparts.  Sizing is accurate for males, but will run larger on women.  My husband's only complaint was the fact that the tops had pockets, which he felt made them less unisex.  Consequently, he removed the pockets and is now completely satisfied with the purchase.
B00BBB16C8|5|Better quality than expected ... was a complete hit at the party!  Product is true to size but is does have slightly stretchy fabric to adapt to a nice custom looking fit.  VERY happy with this purchase.
B00EZ6TUVU|5|Can't beat Hanes for nice, inexpensive sweatpants and shirts.  I wish they had sweatshirts to pair with these pants.  Nice and soft and warm.
B004A7YLOA|5|beautiful, and very responsible.
B0025UEH5M|5|This robe has a generous cut, and is extremely well made.  It is both heavy duty, and heavy.  It is thick, plush, and extremely warm.
B00362TP8M|5|We use it for a photography prop and it works very well.
B001LG94CW|4|Nice simple top, just what I wanted for a casual day at home. The fabric is soft and light but feels thin. I like the color doesn't look much like the picture but that's ok. I originally got a small which was too tight for my comfort, (I usually wear a small) in the earth moss which I returns. I ordered a medium in the earth moss, and they were two totally different greens, the first was more Kermit the Frog green and the second was more earthy and sage which is what I wanted.
B00321I6P0|5|Very well made. They fit perfectly with a vest I am having made that will have an embroidered Viking warship on the back. The company's customer service was outstanding as well with a small change to my order.
B001MIMATI|3|I love the Screen print, of the Wow shirt for Alliance this is a gift for my co-worker, But what I don't like is the Fact that and XL is not an XL it is more of a Childs XL even though it says Adult T-shirt XL I guess I need to by the XXXL for an Adult. So still giving the gift (thought that counts) and she can return it if she wants. but I think that Jinx needs to come up with a better way to figure out Sizing for their t-Shirts.
B00DYY5JKK|2|Same quality as Wal-Mart $3 beanie with obtrusive Hurley tag (not smooth stitched).
B008DWGGS2|1|They did not fit my Oakley M-Frames. The would fit on one side but the other side won't and they keep sliding out.
B00E5R4PAK|4|super cute. The neck is a bit large for my 6 month old but otherwise very cute- one plus of the large neck size, we can use again next year!
B0030BJGVU|5|I have a 42DDD and they bounce around like it's their job. Then I got this bra to put them in check. There is nothing at all sexy about this bra. But it does a suburb job keeping my girls in check. 10/10 would recommend.
B0017KA5NE|5|I recently purchased the red version in Large, i'm a 35\\" waist, and it fits very comfortably and still snug. It doesn't look as \\"tight\\" as it does in the picture, perhaps if I had gone a size smaller, but I didn't want it to feel too tight.
B00569P2V2|5|My fiance loves these camp no,ERS and these are the only ones he buys now there amazing and look sexy on him too!:):):)
B000WZCV1Y|1|This shirt really looks better from far.The material was cheap and when I tried it on the bottom popped off!!!Save your money on this one.
B008G51XA2|4|Very cute dress actually. The belt keeps coming up, wish they had belt holders or something, but otherwise I am happy with it.
B0074ZAAS6|2|It's not like this shirt emphasized on my less-than-favorite areas, it's just not a great fit. I was hoping for more of a blouse look but it's more like a tee which I have plenty.
B00L2QWI0G|5|This scarf is good quality lightweight silk.  It's colors are sharp.  It came on time.
B00FB5PVV2|4|It was a gift for my mother, and she really liked it.  It wasn't a huge wow factor, considering it's cheap costume jewelry, but she thought it was cute, and I'm sure she'll get the price we paid out of it.
B0030KF7PU|3|these jeans are ok but they are a bit short and I wish they were a tad more stretchy for comfort. It is a little difficult to ride my bike because they are skinny at the knee and calf with no stretch. I prefer my south pole brand jeans which are cheaper and extremely comfortable.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SB8UZQ/ref=oss_product
B003LDPB1G|5|Love it!
B00S6U87GA|5|good
B000A38BNU|5|The relax fit is great.  Lots of room where it should be.  They do run large so take that into consideration when ordering.  They do get more relaxed the more you wear them.  Most comfortable jean I've tried in a long time for a large framed person.
B00PJ5MQ7G|5|Loved it so much I ordered a second one in case they discontinue it.
B0095BJFRO|3|Fits a bit smaller than advertised but above average quality material and design.  I would recommend English Laundry.  Just make sure you size it right.
B003TJO8E8|5|Perfect product for what I needed.
B00LEOODG8|4|Very comfortable and warm but fit a little big.
B007JBRNJO|2|It is a shame these compression hose don't stay put. They are nice weight, comfortable on the legs, and footless. I purchased a size medium, which should have worked perfectly according to the size chart. When I wore them, I found I constantly needed to yank them up. They would not stay put over my belly (I am 24 weeks, and it's not that big yet), and, worse yet, would pull my pants and underwear down with them. Literally, I would have to pull them up significantly every 15-20 minutes or so, in addition to each time I bent over. So, I emailed the company and the gal suggested I try a size large as an alternative. I decided to take a leap of faith after spending $30 on my first pair, and got another in a size large. SAME EXACT THING - does not stay put. In short, now I am out about $50 and spend half the day pulling my pants up. Surely there is a better product out there!
B002808UT8|4|I wear a 1X generally, and this 2X fits snugly. That was the point though, so I'm pleased. I will also add that I'm a 42D, which creates quite a plunge for the neckline. I'm not 100% sure if this is SFW for me, but it's definitely going to be good for going out afterwards!
B00P89TPSG|5|I am so glad I found these socks...not only are they warm for cold weather but they are so comfortable even when wearing with slippers. They are the only socks I wear now until cold weather has passed. I have recommended them to a friend and she is sold on them as well.
B0052T91EA|5|I have 2 of the black ones and I absolutely love them! I wear them under my shirts all the time and they smooth things out really well. They work like magic for my apple shaped figure :-) I don't have the muffin top anymore when I wear these! :-)
B00GFAKIJM|5|This dress is gorgeous, and keeping in mind the very reasonable price the quality is quite good.  As others recommended going up in size I got my tall 7 year old the size 10 and it fit nicely.  i have no complaints whatsoever and my daughter looked like an angel at her school induction ceremony....so I am happy!
B001HK804K|1|Purchased this item through Amazon as it was cheaper then the ones found in the Halloween store. Unfortunately being cheaper also means quality decrease. The mask wasn't very good, material felt cheap and what matter most, the mask was a little uncomfortable compared to others even for a younger child. Seller was fast with shipping no complaints, just the mask itself wasn't very good. Maybe it was just me, but I'll go and get the one from the store. Enjoy
B0002MENBS|5|Great capris, they fit well, wear well and wash well.<br />I have several of these and plan to buy more.
B00AE3GPO8|4|So i like to wear my clothes bigger than i am cuz that's what i find comfortable, so i got the 2x version of the hoodie, put it on & it's really more of a Large than anything. it looks cool as any cut scene from the Resident Evil/Bio-hazard franchise though & for that it's def worth buying. also the zipper is on the left side, through me off but im getting used to it.
B004S9NDHG|1|I purchased these pants for a parade costume.  The first time I put them on, they split right down the front of both legs.  I repaired them, then put them on for portfolio pictures.  During my photo session, they split again, same place, both legs.  So, I repaired them a second time, adding more fabric in the legs just to be sure.  At parade dress rehearsal and they split again, both legs, in a different place.  These pants are beautiful but they are not durable.  I was not dancing when the pants split.  They are very poorly made and I do not recommend buying them.  The parade is 3 days away and now I have no pants to wear!!
B00NH1EMSU|5|Came right away and fits as I hoped. I bought two more.
B000QTY34Y|5|I'm outdoors a lot and find it a lot easier to just put on this hat and go than to sit there with a tub of oily sunblock and make sure everything is covered before I can safely set foot outside.  It works well.  I don't appear to get much, if any sun exposure underneath when I wear it.  I wear it a lot.  My wife says it's not a fashion statement, but I don't know.  Maybe with the right outfit.  :)
B00BRFSLIK|5|I bought this on a whim, as it was nicely priced, and my youngest owns a poncho but not a traditional raincoat.<br /><br />This was a winner. My daughter is enthralled with her &#34;fancy&#34; raincoat. Since it hasn't rained, she wears it in the house all the time, prancing around.<br /><br />The fit is true to size, possibly skewing small, and is high quality. It is perfect for warm to cool weather, which meets our needs. It is not suited for sleet or very cold rain, unless you were to layer sweaters underneath.
B004F8EWKW|3|I'm not very impressed by these boxers.  # 1, The sizing seems to be on the small side. # 2, The waist band is so narrow that it rolls up and cuts into skin folds. # 3,There is not enough elastic (expansion) give in the waistband for a comfortable fit.  I have to wear a back brace, and these boxers can't make the grade. It's possible that I got a bad batch, but it's not practicable it try replacement from Japan where I live. It would cost more than I paid to send them back and try getting a new delivery.<br />Anyway, no problems with delivery, the came before the scheduled day.
B006I9PLQK|5|bought for my youngest daughter and was worried if the small was small enough as they seem to only have womens sizes but this fit perfect for my 14 year old.
B002H9W0PU|5|Love these! Best onesies out there and so affordable.
B00E1YRIJC|4|Everything fine
B00DS1IZLE|3|A bit tight in the waist and as previous reviews said, the quality of the picture is not that great.  From a bit aways it is clear, but when you get closer you can see how blurry it is.  Not sure how long they will last, not the best material.  I bought them because they were cheap and got the quality I thought I would.  No more, no less, so I can't give a bad review.  If you want a cheap pair of leggings with some Star Wars flair, these will do it for ya.
B00394Y6Y0|5|Bought this for Mr. Wonderful & he LOVES it.  In fact I have worn it, too.  (Guess I need to by my own, huh?)
B004M6UD46|5|very good product has high quality and is of very good material, I recommend the product for buyers in this class.
B00ATUWZ90|3|I bought these for my husband for our trip to Maui with his family. We loved the style and look of the shorts and they fit him great (he is usually medium and the medium fit just fine). However, after just one day of boogie boarding in the waves (small waves too) they ripped right in the crotch. He continued to wear them and the hole of course just got bigger and if he sat down the only thing preventing him being publicly indecent was the mesh lining which was not very protective haha. Cheap buy, cheap shorts, we knew what we were getting into. If you just plan to wear them and not be active then they might work.
B0018OKMMS|5|A gift for dad
B00DEJR35O|5|I like this s***s, is so soft, and it is a very nice color too, I am so happy with this purchase
B00JRQTA22|2|I had my eye on these jeans for some time, and finally bit the bullet and bought them in a splurge of..... impulse? Ordered size 30 (30x32)<br /><br />The jeans are..... okay at best. In my opinion, if going off the star system, they are definitely not a 5 or 4 star. They COULD be a 3 star, but my utter disappointment resolved with a 2 star. They are definitely comfortable, but the color is so lackluster to the point that I feel cheated by the advertisement (I knew it was obviously not going to be anywhere near as glorious as the pants in the ad, but its much further than I had expected).<br /><br />I'm honestly considering returning them.
B00XTB33BA|5|Somewhat heavy and long. Medium fits slim which I like
B00H0BUI0E|5|I own a beautiful white down coat that, because of the color, has darkened around the edges of the sleeves. No amount of scrubbing or stain remover seems to work. The elastic on the inside of these fur leg warmers fits perfectly around the wrist part of the coat sleeve. I plan to sew them on at some point because they don't stay on when I take off the coat (I have to push them up the sleeve or put them in the pockets), but so far, it matches the fur on the coat collar and looks like this is the way the coat was designed. For the price, this was the perfect solution to my problem.<br /><br />If you're buying these as boot cuffs though, you'd better have a pretty skinny leg, since the elastic would be very tight on a normal sized woman.
B005UVM38Q|5|Party's boutique has become my new online place to shop! They have adorible, in style items. I love this shirt! It is long enough to wear with leggings and gives you a classy professional or casual look depending on what you are going for. The fabric is soft and the buttons or sewn on well so they will NOT fall off. The fabric is high quality and also thin, so if you live in a colder climate like me you just have to pair it with a nice jacket and you are ready to go. I got it in the dark brown and it it is a beautiful shade. I would highly recommend this shirt to women of all shapes and sizes if makes your figure look amazing! If you decide to purchase this I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B00PZ2Z57Q|5|The reversible cuffs are amazing! Makes it look like a new dress shirt when the cuffs are reversed! Great for formal occasions!
B0053BSXIM|4|Good quality pant.  Too bad it was for Halloween and we got super orange or else he would wear them to bed.  As is, he could wear them to scare away bears if we ever go camping.
B00EVDIH1Q|5|Fast shipping fits as expected
B00B5WR1EK|4|This nursing bra is very comfortable!
B00QKHYOAE|4|nice
B00H2XS1OU|3|Pay attention to the stars on the design, they will overlap your nipples &#62;_&#60;
B00FCYHY1W|3|i got the navy blue one, its made out of really good fabric so i can tell this will last me a long time, even though its thin its also stretches out a little but still squeezes my arms. it's okay i can always pass it along so i will not bother sending it back and getting a bigger size. i got a size 18-20 product came way before time due. 3stars it is. (i used my husbands account to purchase lol)
B002HT2OBU|4|Overall, this petticoat was great. It served its purpose to my make my Halloween costume appear longer, more fluffy and to have the appearance of an extra layer so it isn't as thin. The only issue I saw was the transparency (which is illustrated decently in the image, I knew of it before I bought it) AND the whole \\"One Size\\" thing. It worked great for me because I am a solid size 2 at 5'8'', but my friend, it did not, who is a size 16, I believe. It seems to me the One Size is really for sizes 0 - 8 and i think this product would be even better if more precise sizing options were offered. I also would have loved less transparency in the upper portion of the petticoat, but hey, my dress covered that up any way, so it was all good. For it's price and the color options, great petticoat!
B009GCRIE4|5|Absolutely gorgeous scarf in the prettiest shade of pink. Love the colorful bird print - perfect for spring.
B00MU9BLPW|5|I love this dress. The material is like a no wrinkle material is the closest I can describe it. This material is feels silky to the skin. It is safe to order your regular size with this dress. You will love this dress it is beautiful.
B006Z8H7WU|3|Very long
B00PC5GTTY|5|very cute, room to grow
B00EPF6YP6|5|Pretty
B004ZB3PP2|4|Good product. Fit my laptop perfectly!
B000ILE8GS|4|I purchased this book bag to transport my supplemental oxygen equipment.  With the flexibility I can be on a walk or bus tour for up to 12 hours without having to return to home base.  The legs help a lot to keep the 2 cylinders upright.  We are looking forward to going to the Milwaukee Zoo and I won't have to carry my oxygen.<br />It sure helps out. cg
B00PABWMNW|5|i like
B00MW1A906|5|Great shirt! Very soft!
B00NLMZ2HA|5|Love it!!
B00FN6RO96|4|This shirt is exactly what my daughter wanted.  The actual color has a more washed/faded look to it and it runs large.  Same item online elsewhere was $15.00 more.  It is comfortable and was priced well.
B00MQ59YLI|4|Runs just a little small but still a nice shirt
B00FML3LSU|5|This jockstrap is one of the most comfortable I've ever worn. I am tempted to buy another color. If you're in need of a new jock I recommend this brand.
B00AJUZ0B0|5|My wife ordered this trench jacket for me. I wanted it but was a little afraid I have been burnt by online leather before. NOT THIS TIME! My wife placed the order and per website instruction we measured myself. The next morning I got a phone call from Factory Extreme we went over the messurements and talked about how I would ware the jacket. Then my ordered shipping was upgraded at no charge . That was on wensday the next Tuesday I got the jacket. I am 5'8&#34; 270lb this jacket fit perfect! Great soft lamb skin leather the tan color was amazing.  I would compare this to a jacket that is in the $300 to $700 price range. Room to move and when I buttoned up I look 20lb slimmer. The only problem I have is what jacket to order next! Awesome job Factory Extreme! P.s. For proper fit visit there web page messerement is very important! From a customer and fan best wishes Joe
B00J1Y32UQ|1|This robe sounded so good.  I was disappointed to receive a thin, cheap, scratchy terry robe whose fruit loop was already unraveling out of the packaging.<br />Besides being of shoddy material, read the tag on the inside body of the garment-not the neck tag. They warn to stay away from lit cigarettes, candles, flame, fireplaces, hot lights-is this item on the verge of spontaneous combustion?  It's almost humorous. If it is pure cotton as claimed, what have they added to make it so dangerous around heat and light?<br /><br />I would not recommend it-a poor quality item about to burst into flames.
B00BFSAF7O|2|Should advertise runs small
B008F9VWHS|5|Excellent product. Loved the first one. Great delivery time. However This 32 in was the wrong size. It's being returned and the right size is already ordered and is shipped ! Amazing !
B0053O2ZB0|2|size needs to be determined with regards to shoe size.wanted to order but could not risk the socks not fitting my foot
B005FVQUHG|5|Bought the same style in the pay and this fit just as well as the others!
B00CAUWHVI|3|Like the stretch material, but size little larger than other pants of the same size.
B00P7W0LVE|5|LOVE!!!  I am 5'2&#34;, 108lbs and though I love this style most of jumpers I purchased were just too big.  This one fits perfectly, flowy without looking huge.  I purchased the Small and I am very pleased.  The fabric print is so flattering, I could see this fitting many different shapes and sizes, but if you are a small petite this is the dress to get.
B00ELCATZ4|2|material is cheap...I guess, g-star has declined their quality...after a month of use...it's looks old and color fades....I feel hard to recommend this product...
B0038BRQX2|5|I wear tanks most of the time in the summer working in my yard. This one fits great and has the comfort I need.
B00F59HJL4|5|It was everything a little girl could want.  My granddaughter was ecstatic when she opened her box.  She was a hit with all of her friends!
B004I76C0S|5|These pajamas are totally cute and comfortable. I got the pink winged hearts one. I gave my mom the top and I sleep in the bottoms which are cool. Loved this and I would order from this seller again.
B0084XOFNS|5|The silver velvet shrug is exactly what we ñeeded to complete a flower girls outfit. We love it! Thank you.
B00AX8VYYA|5|This was way better than I expected it to be. Solid and great quality. I could not have been happier.
B005CSOI6C|3|Nice fleece and good construction but the sizing is too small. I'm keeping nonetheless since it may work for other &#34;thinner&#34; family members.
B00LM0KG6A|5|I Love it
B000JJJ68E|1|Never got my costume or my money back!!!! It sucks that amazon wasn't there to help!!!! who do I call or how do I get my money back? I use to be a big fan of amazon,but no more!!! Don't ever buy anything from brands on sale people NEVER!!!!!!
B00S1QL8DS|5|I order the retro brown version and do not regret this purchase. Great wallet for a man to have. Debit and credit cards do not bend and the cards slots hold them tight. All my ID fit in one slot. I put cash and coin in the other section (with 2 slots).<br />They say &#34;women's wallet&#34; I say fit for a man too. This wallet is more gender-neutral in my opinion. And I will never return to a men's regular (bifold) wallet again.
B00GAA3HEU|5|Great
B007WA1UO6|1|Nothing like the picture, trash, tent like material, doesn't fit. I advise you not to waste your time or money on this. Disappointing.
B00CD3H44C|2|I am not to crazy about these slipper socks. They are extra large.
B00DQZ8PI0|3|This short fits as expected, but the length is short.  I prefer a longer short.  It is ok for a swimsuit cover.
B001B9EQ2W|4|The pants have kept me very warm on very cold days. I have also received a few compliments about them.
B00VIUGY2E|5|very nice and cute  she love this dress aloooot ❤️❤️❤️❤️
B00ACIG1DU|2|They fit larger than expected
B0000891K4|5|Love the color! However, it tore easily when my sister put it on.
B005THZ7G6|5|My mother is into hankies, so I got her these.  While they're not the finest material - don't even know if they're linen or cotton - she loves them.
B00RPWEHAU|3|Really cute but once I got it in the mail it's super small I am regularly a size XL but didn't even close at all .
B0028681ZA|5|This is a very soft, stretchy, comfy bra for sleeping.  i have supportive day time bras.  This offers little support with a lot of comfort.  I wanted something to wear to bed, and a bra that I could slip nursing pads into if I was leaky.  Worked out great.  True to size.  Does shrink a little in the dryer though which I  learned the hard way by accident.  The care instructions warn against high heat, but I just through it in with everything.
B008CV4UVO|4|a little bit small for size 6,but nice purple
B007SOMC8E|3|Stitching was loose in several places and was tighter across hips and thighs than anticipated. Color was good. Detailing only on front of dress and back was plain.
B00N1QHN78|2|I ordered this bra before my milk came in. When I am engorged, the cups do not fit at all. It has also stretched out quite a bit, so rides up in the back. I hand wash and hang dry my bras, so I am not sure why it has not held up so well after only a few weeks of use.
B00GTY916K|3|Nice jacket, but the sizing is way to small.  Order one size up.  Or more.  I gave mine to my little sister who loves it.
B001ATZTBA|5|I received these items very quickly. I haven't used them yet...going on a trip in a couple months...but they look useful. I'm excited to pack with them.
B000G77LBI|5|I am a Carhartt fan, now that I have 3 (Yep) 3 different jackets. Hey, they look good at the bar or food joint! This is a short, to the pant belt, coat but it is tough and looks good on me, yeh I'm biased, but it really does!
B000IBSZ44|5|Bought this for my grandson and it is adorable. I read the reviews so I bought 24months and he normally wears 18 months but wow it is so cute. Loved the pics in it. Thanks:)
B00KWYDSAS|5|Nice quality for wedding tuxedos!
B00HD7HHKE|5|My daughter fits these nicely! She likes the patterns on them and mix match using them.
B00JX4G6SE|4|Smaller medium that usual.  Great material!
B003E7GUZU|5|Just what I wanted,  fits great
B005OFSJZY|3|it is great for childrens costumes-if you have a waist like barbie then this is what you can wear!  Great Quality though
B00CXWEWO8|3|The quality seemed good but the robe was too large.  My son is about 5'7 and the small robe was swimming on him.
B005E0YA66|1|Very low quality.  Sizes are way way off.  Mine was way too large even though I ordered the same size I wear in shirts every day that fit perfectly.  Company would not issue return label so not even worth sending back after paying $9 in shipping.  Will donate to salvation army.  DO NOT BUY!!
B00HE6FK2Q|1|It is very small dress and short than picture. I tried  to return so far I did not receive any massage from company  to return. cost me more postage than the price of dress .do not buy it is  very cheap  material too
B002SZJT2U|1|Rabbit fur very thin and shedding. Animal skin thin and unattractive. Overall quality and design were deeply disappointing and while I was willing to pay the $100 plus price at the time off purchase, the low quality was completely unexpected and does not support/justify the price.
B00NSS3LHK|5|Im in disbelief. These are awesome. I recently went workout clothes shopping at Academy's and pants I paid $40 each for do not compare to these. They are my favorite and I paid $9!!!! I understand that was a promotional price but even at $16.99 they are well worth it. They fit and look great, and seem to be great quality too. I've only worn them once do time will tell.
B0027VT6DW|5|Looked awesome.
B00FKHOAJK|5|Beautiful dresss. Just what we were looking for.
B009PMLL8E|5|Fit me perfectly even though I usually wear a US (women's) XL-XXL
B0007CKMH2|5|excelente producto
B000Q0AGMG|5|Exactly what I wanted!
B00K3VZSAS|5|I was a little worried about buying pajamas on line for my granddaughter but I needn't have worried they are perfect. My granddaughter is 10 but I ordered a size for a 12 year old as she is tall for her age. They fit perfect and she is very happy with them.
B00BVBD3EW|4|The fit, color & texture is just what I was was looking for.
B004U437KC|5|the perfetc clothe to complete your outfit, nice colors and softly, its look nice with jeans or sport pants , recommended
B00J9PY7RO|5|They fit my 22 month-old to a tee and they look cute alone or under a sweater or button down shirt. Thanks
B005W799K8|3|I don't remember ordering these slippers so must have been satisfied with them. This must have been last Christmas as I do remember the Elvis slippers ordered then.
B00LVSFUIM|4|Great robe, my little guy loved it. It was just a tad on the small side, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. I've washed and air-dried it with no problems, too.
B0009MZW2A|5|I used these socks on my recent trip to New Zealand in winter. Sad to say that I didn't exactly use them as I had intended, which was with my boots. Note: as another reviewer has recommended, you really should have these socks on hand to try on with whatever shoes/boots you're going to purchase because it does affect the fit. However, I did wear them to bed night after night to keep me and my feet warm. They are really comfortable and are perfect for wearing around the house on chilly days/nights. I really do like these socks.
B00M1Y76B4|4|Fast delivery and decent product for the money.  Just a nice cheap lightweight cotton pajama pant.
B00AJYWF64|4|Looks great but too small for big heads.
B00FS3VJWW|5|It was a gift for my wife. Looks years younger in this pleated skirt. I love the way she looks in it
B008IJ9JN4|5|Bought this as a gift for a friend's birthday. Looks fine and he liked it.
B00CONNGVQ|5|I have ordered two of these now. The first one I got was a size Large was very hard to put on, but once wearing as long as I was standing was comfortable. I decided to go back and get a size XL (my waist is 33inches) for days when I'm off and want to lounge. It fits much better with some compression as long as I wear on the second hook. Now after the first week of wearing my first one I had lost an inch and a half! I got very sick and laid off of it for about two weeks. I got my new one and I'm back at it wearing the larger less constricting one at home on days off and then my tighter one while working! I never review products but I truly love this and how it looks on under clothes! As for the back fat spilling over the top what I recommend is getting a good sports bra with cups! It diminishes the appearance of the back fat. Without making you look flat chested. I would also like to add idk if anyone else noticed but wearing this has caused the shape of my boobs to be more perky and &#34;lifted&#34; I've had two kids. So I am a huge fan of this product and hopefully can order a medium here in a few months. :)
B0092TO82Q|5|Fabric is of good quality.Size seems to be true (for this type of garment) .I am 10-12. The small - medium fits perfectly.<br />Color will vary slightly from dress to dress because of the fabric. This makes each one unique. I plan on ordering more of these in different colors. I love it!
B003YJBYPE|4|Great item!
B00IOPP4FY|5|This is such a cute suit! It does run small, I usually where a med/lg but after reading the reviews I ordered an xl. It fits perfect!
B003QU89KY|2|I got this costume a week before Halloween. The arrival was awesome but once I opened the package I became disappointed. Not only was the costume too small but it looked nothing like it was supposed to on the picture. Not worth 50 bucks.
B002O5G0OY|3|i loved the boots but i was disappointed when they arrived due to the fact that the boots were too small i typacly wear size 8 shoes so i ordered a size 9, but to my surprise when i tried to slip them on they would not fit at all! i even tried covering my bare feet in butter since i needed a nice pair of boots for my best friends bachelerett party. (fair warning butter does NOT help) so word to everyone try to size 2 sizes bigger
B00NO2LZLE|3|Too small in the bust, but would have been very flattering if the cups were larger
B00BBLBAP6|5|Perfect for my Rosie the Riveter costume! It really doesn't even look like a wig when you have it on.
B002SG79US|4|This product is awesome for newborns (especially with umbilical cord still on as the shirt allows the cord to have contact with air).  My son has eczema and likes to rub/scratch during a breakout - we like to let him explore with his hands during the day, but we turn the mittens over his hands at night to keep him from waking himself up with a scratch.  The sleeves are longer to allow for a good fit even when the mittens are turned over the baby's hands.    Only drawback which keeps it from 5 starts is the misleading sizes.  Preemie is good for awhile - my son is in the 50th percentile for weight and height and at two months (12 pounds and growing!) is still fitting well into the preemie size and only starting to grow into the newborn.  As long as you take this into account when you order you will not be sorry.
B00ACIHDU0|5|Fit well and cool colors
B00WY283PQ|4|Needed a short sleeve little black jacket to wear over sleeveless dresses, tops or thin-strap maxis for the summer months, to make some outfits a bit more formal or church-worthy, and finally found this one.  There are very few short sleeve jackets available that are not part of a dress, are more tailored than a knit shrug, and that can be purchased separately. True to size, good styling and flattering fit.  I wear size 8/10 and ordered a M; fits perfectly.  I agree with the reviewer below and will look for a black button to replace the gold to make it more versatile and a bit more formal.  That said, although the material is thick enough, it does feel cheap and up close reminds me of the old double knits from years ago.  However, the price was so good and included shipping that it makes the purchase acceptable for use as intended, if not scrutinized too closely.  A jacket like this really stretches your wardrobe options to pull outfits together.  I do wish the material was better quality, and I would pay a higher price for one, because this is really a great little jacket otherwise, and the style is universally flattering.
B00VRE96XU|4|It fits a little big but I wear a cami to smooth it. Torrid bras are quality made (and too cute).
B000SKNXWY|5|I often am wear casual clothes that look better with black socks. Black socks usually fall into the relm of dress clothes and are there for poorly made and uncomfortable while being over prices. These socks are what I've been looking for at the price I've wanted to buy them. I bought 4 packs after I tried the first pack.
B00B76H842|3|For a few months I've been looking for a simple light blue hoodie for those too hot for a coat, too cold for a t shirt spring days for my daughter. Product shipped super fast, good packaging, but I'd call it more of a very light weight yoga hoodie rather than of a sweatshirt thickness which kinda sucks because it was over twenty bucks. But whatever. I'm a lazy online shopper and wont return it.  Plan on continuing my search when I go into the city next month.
B00DVR6FEY|2|Love the design of these, and the quality is very good (especially for the price), but the arms are too small, particularly from the elbows down. My baby has normal baby chub, but these are entirely too tight on her little baby arms, so I can't really use the long sleeve. Very disappointed.
B00MZEZU40|5|These leggings came folded and packaged in clear plastic. They are a soft stretchy material that hugs your skin. They have a wide waist band, which is quite comfortable. I am 5'6&#34; and about 130 pounds. I am not toned or muscular, but these leggings fit me well. They are just tight without making the larger sections of my legs look horrible. They hit just at my ankles. These leggings are great for exercising or for wearing with a long sweater and cute boots.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B009UJB100|4|I love this dress I got it for a Halloween costume but have already worn it normally. The Only complaint is it is quite short and is VERY SHORT when I sit down.
B00JSNRKQ2|5|These are so soft, I didn't know they would be different fur than the other brands but I like this fur a lot more. It is not as long and shaggy as the other brands and very thick and dense and soft, which I hope my posted photos illustrate. It does cost more than other brands, I have some that were $9 and $20. I paid $30 for these. If you want the best looking fur and the highest quality I'd get these. If you are going to buy some to wear once or a few times you might as well buy the cheaper brands. In my photo the black ones are J Valentine brand ($30), the brown are from a costume package (price?), the pink are Rave Diva ($9) and the white are Leg Avenue ($20). All nice quality but in this case the higher priced ones are much nicer quality, from the fur material to the hidden elastic top.
B00HNYYWIC|1|Firstly, as a typical size 1 in women's I had to purchase a size 7 in order for the shorts to fit properly. Not that I'm rating the product based on the size guide but I just thought I'd warn others. To get an accurate idea of what size you will need to order I suggest searching \\"WallFlower Junior's Size Chart\\" and then follow that guide.<br /><br />The true reason I rated these shorts so terribly was due to the fact that even though they were washed on \\"gentle\\" with cold water they were shredded all along the bottom of the shorts (the leg and groin area).<br /><br />My other clothes that were washed along with the shorts were covered in bits of white torn fabric. Mind you I separate the lights from the darks and so all my dark clothes were covered in WHITE strings and small tuffs of fabric.<br /><br />I am so disappointed; I do not often come across a product worthy of such a dismal rating but even though I was gentle they caused me a lot of trouble.<br /><br />I wanted to like these. They felt sturdy and the color of the wash was great but in the end they failed as a product.
B0072KCGWQ|3|they're ok i still slide on my yoga mat
B000QYHBJI|2|Bought this for myself to put on the back of a black button up top. Loved the color and design, and the size was perfect. I followed the enclosed directions, and it looked great on the shirt. Unfortunately it started to come off the first time I wore the shirt. I pulled it off (without damaging the top fortunately) and plan to sew it on at a later date. I had purchased a smaller patch from the same company and it is attached and going strong, so I'm not sure if the size of this patch may be a factor in why it did not stay. I would recommend this patch, but be prepared to have to sew it on.
B00ACIGWJS|5|VERY HAPPY
B005H3IX7M|4|Pretty bra and comfortable.  Fits well.
B00CH6Q9HI|5|Excellent product for the price
B00AVWP6V0|1|Not really as advertised, has a very odd cut to it. I don't think ordering this type of product through the mail is a good idea, wouldn't do it again. My wife didn't like it.
B00F8JYBD0|5|fits for the belt buckle use I bought it for.  nice size and super price. . .. . . . . . .. . . .
B00GN7O6WC|5|Fits as expected for a 15 month old who is about 21 pounds and fairly lean. Cute and good quality.
B001P2RSNE|2|The leg pieces won't stay up on their own, even though they fit perfectly around her leg. It's way too short for a child. Even getting the bigger size didn't decrease the amount of underwear that would show should she not wear leggings with this costume. Going to try and sell it on Craigslist and hope for better with the Raven costume.
B00GMEKWEM|5|This is a very beautiful dress, rich color and amazing fabric.  It hangs wonderfully, and has nice swing to the skirt.  I got it to wear to a tea party bridal shower, and it's perfect!
B003IC0FL6|4|This was a great costume, it looks authentic and with all the top gun badges, every knew it was from the movie. The shape is also fitting, so even if you have a slight belly, it'll make you look like you're in shape! :-)<br /><br />I'm 165lb and 5'11&#34; and the large/medium was too loose, i ended up going with the medium/small
B007KF1VZ6|5|Fits my 12 yr old boy. I like how soft stretchy and thick it is.
B004LXGXVW|4|i love this skirt, it's so big! I bought this for my rose quartz cosplay and its just the style of skirt i wanted. the only bad things are that it isn't gradient pink like it looks in the picture, it's just solid white- and very transparent. If you're buying this skirt simply to go under a fully skirt then by all means go ahead, it's a great underskirt for support, but if youre looking for a cheap big skirt (like i was), this may not be right for you. the tie at the top isn't super sturdy either, reminds me of a shoestring.
B003H6GG4I|1|Ordered a size too large, still too small. material ripped. Held my tummy in tho...had to throw away
B00EZNNXMA|5|I love it and it fits perfectly. I am 5ft 1in and weigh 120-122 lbs. 34, 29, 37 (bit of a pot gut). Bought a size 6 and it looks fabulous.  Hides the gut very well.
B00IIX7UUO|3|Good quality, pretty, but nothing exceptional. A tad short for me.
B00652C75I|4|This jacket feels a little large but I think in the winter when I may need to wear something under it that it will work great.  The material is soft and comfortable unlike the usual hard plastic coated rain jacket and the ventilation is perfect.
B00MNGKCCK|1|Don't like runs small
B005SDD7TA|5|My Brother loves it. He also stated the fit was great. He wears it to work to cover his clothes when he rides his motorcycle.
B000N8RV6U|5|i have many pair of these they fit well
B00SUOIHL2|5|Received my Kangaroo Furry Wolf Hat and this is another that is going in the collection I have going for my grand baby for Christmas. This hat is made of top quality material, and so well sewed, and looks so cute! I can't wait for her to open it for Christmas will come back and put pictures on all the hat she gets. She is just going to have a ball.
B00IWMD8NY|5|Love them. Perfect fort halloween costume
B008NCYBJ8|3|I am keeping these leggings although they are a little thin and shiny.  Will work just fine as an undergarment for warmth, but I won't be wearing these on their own...
B000ODDNDO|5|I am a 32A and this fits me fine.  For the first time ever, I am confident purchasing any type of shirt and not only shirts that I can wear a bra with.  I love that I found this!  I just wish I had one back in my college days when I couldve gotten way more use out of it.
B00JKR8OIY|4|they are short if you are large down there it will show
B00MFAT1QW|5|cute boardshorts on my husband, even bought a matching pair for our son
B00K3W8P16|5|Love it. My 2 moth old love the feel of this pj.
B00GD6K7KI|5|This shirt is awesome
B0027VT614|5|wow fits perfect and looks real very full as well
B004J8I290|5|The blouse is very nice. a tab but shear. I just love it! Sizing was perfect, laundered several times now and looks just as good when I purchased it
B0007YR8ZO|3|The 38&#34; band was fine but the D cup was a little small whereas the DD cup is way to large. I'm an in-between.
B00UMITPZQ|5|LOVE!
B0007QMPTG|5|I love this bra! It's the only strapless bra that I don't have to constantly pull up because it stays in place. It fits perfectly! I bought 2 since I find myself wearing them often in the summer. I definitely recommend this bra!
B00ZISHJ5S|1|Really dissapointed.... One ear was facing forward with the tan showing and the other ear was on completely backwards...... :/ I'm afraid to try and fix because the whole hat might come unraveled. I know it's a cheap product from China but still... How do you not notice the ears are completely wrong...!?! Other than that it's pretty cute, large for newborn probably more like 3-6 months
B00IKCMQAW|4|Not bad for the price, little short.  Fabric was ok
B00NB8728G|4|I normally wear a small in scrubs. (most smalls are (ever so slightly) too big, but the XS are just too tight for comfort for me personally) I am a 32 D and waist is 27 if that helps anyone on sizing decisions.<br />-I ordered the small, and it was really big around my rib cage and waist area, but fit well in the boobs, and shoulders and length was perfect. I exchanged it for the XS, which was SUPER easy, and the fit was better around the rib cage and waist but tight in the boobs, there is no stretch factor to this fabric. I can get away with wearing a regular sports bra, but nothing more, or a supportive sports bra.<br />- The length was a tad short but do-able.<br />- The pattern is beautiful. Its such a subtle change and when it catches the light it gives a &#34;is that leopard print?!&#34; expression.<br />-We can only wear solid white, black, or teal at work so this gives my scrubs a little personality without breaking the rules! I purchased the black. If the length was longer in the XS, I would order this in the teal.
B00BZ5Y8ZC|4|Darling costume!  I got a lot of compliments on it.  However, it does run quite small.  I got the Medium (which says sizes 10-14).  I usually wear a 10 and occasionally an 8, and found the costume to be very tight around the hips.  My friend got a Large and it looked a lot better.
B0006I46F6|5|Great fit.
B002LNQJO0|2|clumsy, hard to pull out cash or ccards.  back to a single clip.
B013IOODXO|5|PERFECT! and fast shipping!
B00ANFMK9Q|5|Small fit but love it
B00VOG0L9Y|5|I bought this for my son bc he LOVES Lebron James! Very Cool!
B00BPXSVA2|3|The length of this jersey is shorter than anticipated.  Picture is not accurate.
B004CKXM68|5|Good product. Looks nice.
B00VELUMPM|5|Great pj's
B00CZ5AE2W|5|All 3 of my children love their Hatley pajamas! They wash very well and stay nice and soft. We are able to pass them down to cousins when we are done with them and you wouldn't even think they had been worn more than a season. The designs are adorable every year.
B00330N7SG|4|These are quite comfortable and I like them.  Actually I liked them so much I decided that today I'd go back and order another 3 in different colors.  However, since I ordered these on 8/1 the price has gone up $2.00!  So in protest, I decided not to order any more.  Will just make do with what I have.
B0055QNLR8|5|My husband has suffered with knee problems ever since he \\"grew 6 inches in one summer\\" as a kid :) He is stubborn, and refuses to have his knees looked at but I figure he probably doesn't have much cartilage left in there and will need a knee replacement soon. In the meantime, I bought these braces for him hoping he'd find some relief. He said they roll down a little but not too badly and that if he sleeps in them his knees don't yet as bad the next day. So, thumbs up from us!
B00N0BNDKU|5|This is beautiful! so big and long! Fast shipping and oh so soft. I was so impressed, for the price, can't beat this! Nicely packaged too.
B00QGI49MU|5|smooth and comfortable
B008DS0MXG|2|The dress is pretty short which isn't too big of a deal because i can just wear it with tights but the sleeves don't puff at all they just look sloppy and droopy. ive ordered alot of alegra k things and liked them but this particular one just falls flat.
B005LA5WXE|5|I expected the shorts to be navy and white striped but they are more of a navy and gray (my son says navy and beige).  I hesitated getting these because of what I thought were white stripes.  They are excellent quality and my son is thrilled with them.
B00Q1QQ1G4|3|Still waitin have to wait about a month not so ecited about that 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒 ill give it 5 stars if i like the product
B00E0SP9RC|5|My husband is an ICP fanatic and he absolutely loves this shirt! It fits him perfectly and didn't shrink from being washed.
B00G99WYX2|4|Very comfortable and cool under a pair of shorts.
B00A7TFMUC|4|These pants are great - it's probably just my body type but the pants seem to be a little saggy in the front crotch but fit well in the thighs
B00JMLFAOO|5|Love this jacket. Fits very well and is comfy!
B007EFB5AS|5|Made out team even tougher at the tough mudder.  Very fun and the capes stayed on the whole time.  Very tough sock!
B002093MMM|4|I am a size 10 and bought size 34 which fit good on the third hook & eye therefore  I could have bought one size down. My only complaint is the shoulder straps feel very tight.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B00J7GYXMO|3|I liked these pants with the first wear (though they seemed too short then) but they lay shorter on the thigh than the picture shows. I am not a tall woman (5'5) and was surprised that after washing once and air drying, these became too high. The fitting everywhere else (waist and bum etc) was perfect with what the chart suggests.
B00WV1ZPXS|1|Really small fit
B004496DS6|1|the length from crotch to waist is enormous.  Seams and material itch like crazy.
B00E3BDNWO|5|Love the soft comfortable pajamas.
B0029F269C|5|The color of this hat was just great.  The size of the brim was what I needed for protection from the sun.
B00OULKQT0|4|There was confusion with my order so I ended up with the mustache top so that's which I am reviewing here.<br />They are sized baggy so no need to order a larger size.<br />Very comfortable.<br />Wash well<br />You can see my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MeeU3DeVEs
B00LZRWJ10|5|I am about 5'9 and 155 lbs with an athletic muscular build, chest extended, and wide shoulders on a 4/5 day weight workout per week.  I wear a 31&#34; waist.  I tried the medium first which did in fact fit, but when raising my arms toward the front and especially above my head, it rode a bit too high into the arm pits.  The large fit me perfectly.  The primary difference between the medium and the large is the length of the shirt and the sleeve.  As far as the fit around your arms, they are equally snug.  The medium fit right at the crease between the biceps and shoulders, but rode too high when placing your arms in front and above you, making it slightly uncomfortable and feeling too short (after 2 washes following the wash instructions).  The large fit perfectly which fit right at the crease between your biceps and shoulders (after 2 washes following the wash instructions), but with room to play around when you place your arms in front and above you. You can pull the sleeve down beyond the crease to your biceps with the large.  However, with how snug it is, it finds itself back on the crease between the biceps and shoulders.  It is a perfect fit and does not feel uncomfortable when walking around.  With the medium you feel like you have to pull the sleeves down.  Not the case with the large.  If you feel you have the same body type as me, get the large.  It looks great and certainly complements the muscle tone for an athletic build!
B00KMYXY0W|4|My husband is 5'11&#34; and finds this tie slightly shorter than he normally likes, but since his company observes 'patriotic Tuesdays' he wears it often. I like the pattern better than most US flag ties, a bit more subdued.
B00OBGOP4G|2|The size chart on the Amazon website showed medium as 34-36, when the package arrived the actual size was 32-34.  Underwear are too small.
B00HV39758|4|These are just fun summer dress socks.  Nice to go along with gray slacks or a pink shirt.  Nice quality and Gold Toes always fit well, too.
B00405ZP6U|4|nice pants but they run a size small.
B00BWM8ARU|5|so, for $70, shipping from china, for a whole costume... I wasnt expecting too much.... I was pleasantly surprised, however!!! I ordered mine in a large, and declined to give any specific measurements. mostly because the measurements they gave were close enough and I did not care enough to measure myself... I am a bit lazy afterall... I am about 5'9&#34; and weigh about 220lbs, so I am a bit wide around the middle. the costume still fit rather well, though.<br /><br />I will start from the outside in:<br /><br />The cloak: This may have been the cheapest thing on this costume, but it was better than I was expecting. it has a hood, long sleeves, is brown, just like in the picture. it is thin fabric that sort of reminded me of a new, crisp bed sheet. it was a little awkward to put on, but once it was on, it fit comfortably.<br /><br />The belt: the belt was a plastic, made to look like leather. decently thick. connected in the back by velcro. it was a little tight around the mid-section, but I am a little fat, so for anyone else, I am sure it would have fit just fine. the pouch on the side looked like a cheap phone holster, and if I had a smaller phone, that is exactly what I would use it for. it closed and kept itself that way with the same magnetic buttons that you would find on any old phone holster.<br /><br />Tunic: the tunic thing came in a few different pieces. there was the midsection, the two shoulder pieces, and the actual tunic thing itself. my biggest frustration with this whole getup, is that there is no way keep the shoulder straps on your shoulders. my shoulders are a bit slopey, and so the shoulder straps kept falling off. easily fixed, however, with a $2 pack of sticky-backed velcro pads. the color was off white. the fabric wasnt high quality, by any means, but it was better than I was expecting. the midsection part has velcro that it uses to connect itself in the back. the shoulder pieces go under that. one other small complaint I had with this, is that the tunic part did not have any way to stay closed on itself. I have worn martial arts uniforms, and they are all made similar to this piece, but the martial arts uniforms have little strings you can tie to keep it closed. this does not have that. the midsection and the belt keep everything together, so it was not that big of a deal. the shoulder straps hung a bit farther than the tunic than I would have liked, which annoyed me, but was a minor detail.<br /><br />The Undershirt: the undershirt is a similar brown to the cloak, but not the same. it is short sleeved, and is made of slightly thinner fabric than the rest of it. it is the part that just peeks out at the chest. again, just like the tunic, the undershirt does not have any strings to hold it together. and yet again, it is not that big of a deal, because everything still gets held together rather well.<br /><br />Pants: the pants... are pants... big surprise... just like the rest of the costume, it looks fine, but is a bit thin. you wont be wearing these in the winter... there is a metal hook as a clasp, like you would find on dress pants, and in fact, felt a lot like dress pants. there was elastic in the waistband (cause im fat) and the biggest thing that surprised me was the fact that the pants had pockets!!!! yay!!!! someplace to hold my phone and keys and stuff while I am walking around!!!!<br /><br />overall:<br />I am really happy with my purchase. I debated giving this four stars, because of some of the above issues, but I considered the price and the value of the item, and couldn't bring my self to do it. I ordered this from china, and selected expedited shipping, and my item came in about two or three days... from china... wow... but everything came the way it was supposed to... Again, I was never under the impression that this would be high quality. if you want high quality, you are going to spend hundreds of dollars. but for $70 (not including the extra I spent to ship it faster) this was higher quality than I was expecting. it was made with slightly lower quality materials, but the workmanship on it was outstanding as far as I am concerned. I am a gigantic star wars nerd, and I can comfortably say that if you are on a budget, this is an excellent option for you.r quality than I was expecting. it was made with slightly lower quality materials, but the workmanship on it was outstanding as far as I am concerned.

B00JLAZUEG|5|It's just the right size quality is also very good
B00JG6I6OQ|5|What a great idea for a belt! I wish I would have had this a long time ago! The buckle and the mechanism feels very solid. The belt says that it is &#34;Genuine Leather Coated with Polyurathane&#34;. I looked at other ratchet belts but they were more than twice the price so I went with the EazyBelt and I'm not disappointed. I feel like the quality is very good and will last plenty long. My only disappointment was that the color  I received didn't look like the photo. The brown in the photo looks like a lighter tan and the belt I received is quite a dark brown. It's not a deal breaker for me but you may want to contact the seller before you order if that is important to you.
B00SAIAISI|3|The shirt is nice, I usually go for a medium but feel like a small may have worked better - its very roomy and so doesn't fit as well under scrub tops as other shirts I have.  The sleeves are super long - which works great for someone like me who has extremely long arms and usually can't find sleeves long enough.  Also a very long body, comes down to about mid thigh on me.  The material is comfortable enough but if not removed from the dryer right away, they wrinkle pretty bad.
B0080RXKMA|1|Way to small
B0058MXVNS|5|My daughter likes this dress since she is taking ballet lessons. It has very good design and the material is really good.
B00E0KETUS|3|Is small not medium and the fabric is the one I spect  but is also to short barely cover my waist
B00S2ZZ046|4|Loved the shorts, tossed the belt.
B0020ML3F2|2|I am really really particular about socks. I want them thick, I want them soft. Like cotton soft. Doesn't have to be cotton, but it has to feel that way. This just didn't cut it.
B009H4ZGGS|3|I ordered a size 9 which is almost always a perfect fit but there isn't much give in the material.  It fits but It's a tight fit :)
B00827RTRU|5|I love Jockey skimmies.  I have a few different styles, and all of them are just perfect.  Just remember, this is not shapewear.
B00FT9GLOG|5|Daughter loved it
B001CMKW8K|4|Just tried it on...very simple to adjust and put on.  Looks like it's going to be a lot of fun and just makes one feel good about themselves.
B00I3Q41HG|1|This skirt looks so cute that's why I bought it but its completely see thru and it cannot be worn by itself. Need to find some shorts to wear under it cuz a slip will make it look bulky so it's going to sit in the closet for a while. Don't waste your money
B0057ZPSRS|5|excellent value.  better than expected.  will consider other merchandise from selected vendor.  good material, great fit.  both warm and soft.  cdp
B00LVS154K|5|Fits perfectly.  The Large Tall has a longer shirt tail so less risk of it coming un tucked when wearing.  Great weight and it has a slightly trim fit.
B000OAY39K|5|GOOD FITTING. I WAS SATISFIED
B002DZZHJE|2|Didn't fit rite
B00C2K91EC|5|I recently started wearing boxer briefs after so many years of wearing basic briefs. I like the jockey brand provided I can find the boxer briefs with a decent amount of spandex. 100% cotton boxer briefs are a total waste of time because once they stretch out, they stay stretched out. Us well endowed guys know how uncomfortable that can be. 😊 I used to buy my favorite jockeys at Macy's but they no longer carry that style at the store or online. After reading many of the positive reviews for this particular style, I ordered 3 pairs and could not be happier. The extra spandex makes these briefs extremely comfortable and the mesh allows for excellent breathability. One pair costs as much as a 3 pack of the 100% cotton briefs but they're worth very penny!! I will be ordering more from amazon.
B007SDORKG|1|Its okay. Not at all what I expected. Its mesh, but the holes are huge!!! Its not flattering on my 5'1 body either. Its made for a tall figure. Waste of my money to be honest.
B000QU1UCG|3|son wears a 16 ... ordered 18 and not even close to fitting. returned and got a different brand that fits as expected
B001IML9QS|5|Didn't shrink after washing.  Haven't worn it enough to say more.
B002HTYA4E|4|It fit pretty well except the sleeves.  Make sure you get the petticoat because it'll look weird without it.
B00D7K18BK|5|Love them for my husband! He loves baseball and they are subtle, not too obnoxious! Good quality for the price!
B003B98F68|3|I thought it was longer, but its okay.
B00OZDPARQ|5|I love it. Looks even better in person. Highly Recommend.
B005HJ8PBU|5|the overalls work great and fit as we expected them.
B00IPE3XEI|5|Fit just right. Awesome costume. Now the whole  family matches!
B00D2W7T3Y|1|Very disappointed with this product the material is not comfortable at all and the side wires are HUGE and show through your cloths in the side.  It also says it's &#34;high waist&#34; when the product is so short it doesn't cover hardly anything on my lower torso like my love handles or lower middle back and I'm only 5'2 and don't have a long midsection.  Definitely  not the length the photo shows.
B00UO1AL0Y|5|I'm normally a M and I bought a L just incase it went too small and it fit perfect :-)
B008S9NAY8|5|This costume looked surprisingly good. I'm used to cheap crappy costumes and this was cheap but actually looked really good. The shirt fit well and looked nice. The belt was super thin but stayed on and didn't rip. There are indeed two bandannas - one smaller for your head and one larger for a bit of flair on your waist. Lastly are the boot covers which seemed like they were sliding down but I put an extra rubber band under each one of them and they were fine. The band can go under the covering by the top and isn't visible. I'd recommend this costume to anyone looking to be a pirate.
B00L8KRA1S|4|I loved it!
B00KF3C4YM|5|Good
B0065FF4YG|5|Love the silky way it feels!
B00CZ5CR04|5|No complaints.  Worth the extra to have cotton (vs a synthetic).  Nice design, slim not baggy and cool enough for an eight year old boy.  I will buy Hatley again!
B00CMJRRRG|4|kinda hurt when on...A bit tight.
B001A6E8NI|5|The hat arrive two days early, which was absolutely wonderful for me. Fabric seems to be a thin cotton base but very nice. Material wise my only complaint would be the thin shiney material on the visor, I don't think it will last terribly long but should be easily fixed or replace.<br /><br />As several reviews have noted, the cap makes for a wonderful starting point for various costumes requiring  a peaked cap. The badge is incredibly thin plastic and is easily removed, including most or all of the glue residue. That hat is one size, non adjustable and is big on a size 7 1/4 head like mine, so I believe it will fit better for larger sizes. I fixed this by hot gluing craft foam sections into the plastic band though and it fits very comfortably now. It is lightweight and the peak is hilariously high and I love it. For my own run around purposes I am glad I took a chance on this rather than spending $30+ on a surplus peaked cap.
B00J2IF0I8|5|My daughter loved it as her Christmas gift.
B00BZTDCI2|5|This sweater is much nicer than the picture shows. You need to buy a size smaller than you normally wear. I had to return the S/M and get the XS/S.
B00248YF6Q|5|Fits like a glove, and shipping was super fast!
B000SKLTIE|4|good product, 100% cottoon
B003OQVMOK|5|Very comfortable all year round.
B001G1K80Y|4|This bra is very pretty and femenine. Very comfortable, too.  It does come up quite high and is very obvious under a lot of those low cut maternity shirts. However it does look like a lacy cami, so you could get away with it if you wanted to. I only wish this bra was made for \\"big girls\\" and larger sizes were available.  I ordered the largest (38DD) and it fits well now, however I haven't had my baby yet and my milk hasn't come in either. I just hope it fits as well when this happens. Until then, it is my favorite nursing bra :)
B000N6ZVC8|5|Great
B0098NBSYC|3|It honestly looks better in the picture, but since I LOVE giraffe print I will just have to make it work!
B00QQ8TEJI|3|Forgot mittens and socks other wise love this deal
B009UPWOIW|4|The price was perfect and the dress beautiful, it fitted well and the combination of colors perfectly matched I am very satisfied.
B00IZ38GL4|3|This is adorable but not US plus size
B00HWOBR6I|5|Great shipping and good quality boxers!
B00H48KH2M|2|Too shiny. It defeats the purpose. Can be see even thru &#34;black&#34; fabric. Have to stretch the petals while pressing in your Nip's to get a good fit without unraveling at the edges. Been able to wear a few days even thru showers (which is a good thing). Would be better if no shininess and a little darker in color (at least for me. I'm med light skin toned). The pics &#34;should&#34; show both sides. Would have been more helpful to make a choice of this purchase.
B000FIA43K|5|I was tired of wearing the \\"too big\\" safety vest I had to wear while working.  It would slip off my shoulders, and get caught on snag points.  So much for safety.  When I found out we were allowed to wear safety green shirts to work in, I bought a week's worth of these Safety Green T-Shirts.  They are bright, visible, and comfortable.
B00HNPKE60|4|Was a little smaller than expected, but was very cute.  Picture doesnt do it justice. Word word word word word.
B00P9BVD88|5|A beautiful product. Runs a little smaller than normal! Be warned a size small usually fits me but is a tad tight so you might want to go a little bigger, but it's no fault of the product
B008LOOP12|5|Got this for my wife and we suspected just an OK quality.  We were wrong.  This is very nice fleece.  Warm enough for short stay in the cold and light enough to not burn up inside while shopping.  Nice colors also.  Got her an extra one for Christmas....  shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
B00MJHQLI2|4|I am a little disappointed with this hat mostly due to my wrongful expectations I guess. This is just a plain beanie hat, nothing spectacular. The size is good and it fits fine. It does tend to roll a little inside-out as you wear it and I find myself taking it off for adjustments more often than I would like.<br /><br />There isn't any design on the hat even with the seams or stitching - it's a plain jane. If that's what you're going for, then this is the hat for you. If you want something a little more stylish - find something else.
B00E5RMHSW|5|Great product and fells great, and the shirts look like the picture!
B00CPSTHJ0|5|Great Dr. Who gift idea.  We purchased for one of our kids.  They loved it, and wear in and around school.
B00IJOLFGW|5|After making online purchases for awhile, sometimes you just ready yourself for receiving clothing purchases that are not what you'd hoped, but this was not one of them.  The shirt arrived when Amazon said it would, possibly a few days before the date-and this was in December.  The shirt fit true to size and was a good quality.  The printing looks just as it does in the picture, and was a huge hit with my teen daughter.  We haven't washed it yet, so I can't fully say what the condition will be after a first washing, but we generally don't machine dry things like this to preserve the life anyway.  I would definitely buy from this seller again!!  You won't be disappointed, order it.
B004A7XY5W|3|The colors where completely different, which is ok for me but maybe not for everyone. (2 white, 2 salmon, the rest black or dark blue)
B001GG4CGU|4|This was s cute. We have twin girls and they were  a hit every where we went. The only problem I had was that the tail Velcro's on. It was hard to keep it on with all the moving around and stuff. Still so cute!
B00BFSBU6E|5|Nice looking shirt.  Very comfy....  Hubby loves it!!
B0098TUYSC|5|True to size. Nice quality. Very pleased with this product.
B00M7ODSN8|5|perfect. 100 % recommended . all in perfect condition .
B009SDU20S|5|It is great looking. My date will use it use it next year she says I like the look on her of the little delicate design above her nose!
B00EE5LLQY|5|I love all Muk Luks products that I own and these are no exception. They fit great and are so soft and comfy. Nice for the winter and fall but aren't too thick for spring or summer days. Great color and quality!
B00D5WXVSS|2|Does not fit well very at all. Too tight. 127lbs and 5'6. Would prefer to have at least 3 sizes.
B00LM475DS|4|ITS VERY NICE.  ACTUALLY I EXPECTED IT TO BE A BIT CHEAPER LOOKING THEN IT IS.  I AM NOT A BIG FAN OF THE LITTLE GOLD CROWN ON THE FLAP.  THAT MAKES IT LOOK JUVENILE IN MY OPINION.
B00F3KNRCK|5|These are wonderful ear muffs! My 9 year old daughter loves them and says they are so comfortable and warm!
B00JQMH9RU|5|Very good t shirt. Light weight. It is made of a stretch material.  Stays relatively dry when worn in the rain. If it gets wet when wearing it drys very quickly.  I have washed these many times.  The material stays strong and the color does not fade even after multiple washes.  Shipping was very quick. received product a few days after order was placed.  These are priced much more economically than other brands. They are all shipped in one package. Environmentally friendly as it is not necessary to open and discard multiple plastic wrappers.
B00ISLA10W|4|THE SHIRT COLOR I ORDERED WAS MAROON, WHAT I RECEIVED WAS A BROWN SHIRT. NOW, IM NOT TO UPSET BUT , THE SHIRTS ORIGINAL TAG DOES SAY &#34;MAROON&#34; . I CAN STILL WEAR THIS TO WORK, ITS JUST GOING TO GET DIRTY ANYWAYS! BUT FUTURE REFERENCE, LOOK AT WHAT IT TRULY IS NEXT TIME ! THANK YOU. DEBORAH
B00AOLNE12|2|I wish I could give two reviews:  one for the fit and one for the overall construction.<br />The fabric and overall construction of the shirt is top notch. Just looking at it out of the first washing, I can tell that it would be a long-lasting item.<br />I can only assume that because the shirt does not fit. I have been very frustrated in buying Carhartt items online because the fit is unpredictable. Sometimes to small, sometimes just right, sometimes too big.<br /> My advice is to buy Carhartt products as they perform very well ...just don't buy them online.
B002FSFZNC|5|I had to find something that would serve a medical need after a medical procedure & I needed cotton.  These were just perfect & I would recommend them.  In addition, if you have problems with your thighs rubbing together this will work for you.  While I no longer need them, I will always keep them just in case.  Oh & the price was reasonable also.
B00FAPF190|3|I got this for my two year old. It found it for a really cheap price on here, so for the price I paid it is worth it because he likes it. However, it is very small and the handle doesn't extend very high. I would not recommend it for any child over the age of 4. Also, it doesn't roll all that well either. So, bottom line, if you get it cheap and for a toddler, this is great. Otherwise, it may not be the best option.
B00O417ZPO|5|My bf bought this for me bc he has Prime. But when something I receive from Amazon or any other store is really cool, I feel the need of sharing my review. I'm 115lbs and 5.05'. I usually wear XS - S and this time went L because of the reviews. And fits perfect for me. I,m 34B and the top fits just fine. I,m Small torso and must say this swimsuit definitely is not for large torso women, as I still had to pull a little up the straps to cover the top area.<br />Great price, perfect vintage look, great fit if you go two sizes up. The material is soft, doesn't look cheap at all. And with the perfect accessories you are good to go.<br />I'm attaching a photo of how I'm planning to wear it.
B002729VKE|4|Have had this belt for some time now, and find it satisfactory, especially for the price. Buckle clasp originally would slip off belt at times, but slight bending of clip with pliers corrected it.
B003CH96AI|5|This is a beautiful, colorful, well made shawl.<br /><br />It is terrific for any occasion.<br /><br />I will definitely order merchandise like this in the future.
B005L3H3VU|5|keeps me really warm.love it
B00FT764H2|1|The uniform came un-done at the seam within the first hour of wear, then the fabric ripped from there. My wife uses others everyday for work and has never experienced this with the rest.
B005Q0E10E|5|Awesome product!  I love it and hopefully my husband will too for Father's Day! All his geek friends will be jealous!
B007ZZJ74S|5|These are super swimming shorts. They fit snugly, are stylish and comfortable for our son. We are glad we found these!
B00FHMPSLM|1|Two thumbs down! Horrible
B00PW6UUDE|5|The hoodie fits perfect but other people say to order a bigger size i didnt and im Glad i didnt the hoodie is so comfy and warm feeling the thing i was kind of disappointed about was the dimond on the hoodie isnt as bring as in the picture
B0058Z7OTW|5|The color and the style are very like.<br />Height 177CM weight 78KG, in W31L32 just good.<br /> I do plan to buy more...they are now my favorite pair of jeans.
B009OXI01U|5|I am a small woman who was looking for a blue belt to put thru the loops of jeans and blue pants.  This one was called a men's belt and no width was given.  I was afraid that it would be too wide for the loops, but it's perfect (2 in).  The length was given in cm. rather than inches, so I had to go to another site to translate.  I found that 85 cm. = 32 in. belt.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, substantial leather belt.  It's a bit stiff now, but I expect it will soften up and last for years.
B001ELJNCA|5|Fits as advertised.  Recommended if one wants real comfort, which doesn't bind.  Worth buying, especially if on sale.  Good job Amazon.
B00L11J3WS|1|Very lightweight and sheer. Not a Winter sweater.
B00DVJFSZO|2|Gloves run too small.  XXL fits like XL or smaller.  Also they are very thin.  Disappointed.
B00BP9MKBW|5|Good quality and I liked having the onsie undershirt to keep from showing his tummy! Great buy and would recommend to other mothers!
B00KM63H84|5|Perfect hat
B00BG4DGH8|3|It's a cute dress and is pretty on my 3 yr old girl. But the fabric is stiff and does not breathe well. And after just 1 landry, the side seam is open for 2 feet long! I was about to return it, but my daughter loves it so much, so I sewed up the open seam and kept it.
B009K3VQC4|5|These were absolutely breath taking. They were used as part of a Marduk gras themed wedding where the brides maids walked in with them. They were so beautiful and looked like you were in New Orleans for Mardi Gras
B00OHORAB2|4|Nice warm jacket. Good sleeve length and overall length, but snug width wise.
B007GBWFYK|4|I like the shirt, although someone thought I was wearing a dress shirt in a machine shop...  looks good, feels great, though I wish it was cheaper so I could justify buying many more.
B004YZ83X8|5|I buy these for my oldest girl and she likes them, yet my almost 5 year old twins say they are the most comfy ones ever!
B001CF33A6|3|It was too small but kept for collection of C&C memorabilia.
B009VZR2X8|3|they seem to loosen up after wearing them for a few hours, not really crazy about that
B008RPMUKI|4|I didnt like the fact that it comes folded because it just makes it look ugly and wrinkly but its very pretty.
B00L33CXSA|5|need to reorder a large. she was bigger than we thought. the extra large worked much better. great look great fit.
B00DWXJWRE|5|These were for my 9 year old who is on the very small side.  They fit well on him...the top is a little short for my liking but he doesn't notice this.  The pants fit perfect for him.  Do not put them in hot water because they will shrink up A LOT.
B00MO8AXV2|3|Fabric and quality on this one was just average.  Return was easy.
B004RGPAVW|3|This item does the job it is intended to do, but these fit oddly.  I ordered these specifically to wear under my sports bra when I workout.  They do soak up the perspiration, but they tend to wad up under your bra making them uncomfortable.  The bottom of these reach nearly all the way around my back but there was no way to secure them so the strappy bottom just sort of hung out from under my bra.  The fit is uncomfortable and unattractive when you look in a mirror. It looks like you have a wad of something under your tshirt.  I wish the picture had shown how long the bottom of the bra liner is.  I have no idea why anyone would need the liner to go so far around your sides and back.  I saw another brand of liner on The Dr. Oz. show that does the same job and fits better.
B00KUH06AW|3|It ran really small, like almost 2 sizes to small. So it was very snug.
B00E8GRJMO|5|I wore this to an &#34;ugly holiday sweater&#34; party. Rather then look for something expensive and ugly that I'd wear once, I opted for this. It got plenty of attention and nice compliments and I plan to wear it again. Not itchy and i got XXL because Im a bit heavyset and it was very comfortable and true to XXL size.
B005J4Q2C2|5|This hat fits better than any other hat I have ever owned!  The embroidered Sepultura S on the front and SEPULTURA across the back is just the icing on the cake!  Might just buy another one as a backup!
B00DMDNV0S|5|Nice and comfortable
B00GZITKOI|5|These are just as cute in person as they are in the picture. My daughter does not like shoes at this point but will wear these with no problem. Good quality, especially for the price. Love them!
B00D11AV8Q|5|It fits perfectly and it is stylish. I love it. No complaints!
B002GHC57G|5|product was delivered fast and it met my expectations
B00K1U4G90|5|I'm a skinny guy, so this fit just about right. Anybody who lifts, order a size up unless your idea is to look like a banana too big for its skin.<br /><br />I wore this to a banana bar crawl (because ADULTS) and it went over very well. Lots of people had ordered the full costume and wished they had clicked through a couple more times until they found this.<br /><br />I don't have many occasions to resemble a banana, but now I'm prepared for all of them. This gets five stars because it's unfair to take it out on the jacket that I can't wear it very often.
B000TA741O|3|The socks are fine; I've bought the brand for many years.  What I did not like was the rather deceptive advertising. I bought a two-pack.  In my book, a two-pack would be two pair of socks for just short of $19.  That is a good buy.  Buying one pair at almost $25 with postage is a bit of a rip-off.<br />Dr. Bob Blackwood
B00LUXD5QM|5|very soft and warm. My toddler loves it!
B0046BOOVA|4|This bathrobe is the warmest and coziest I've ever owned. But, even after reading reviews that said it ran large, and ordered a size down, I had to cut 4 inches off the hem so it wouldn't drag on the ground and trip me. Overall it's still way too big. BUT, having said that, it's my favorite snuggle robe and warms me quickly when I've got that winter chill. I don't wear it as an everyday robe, so I don't mind the extra room. It's perfect, except for the sizing.
B00724QOLQ|1|Ordered a black extra large XL Back to the Future shirt. Received a navy medium M College shirt. Not worth returning.
B007H5333C|1|In the picture, the bra looks great, looks very supportive. When I received it, the bra was all wrinkled and it looked disorienting on me and does not have ANY support to it at all.<br />The quality of it is a bit flimsy and looks more like a $9.99 bra to me.<br />I'm sorry but Im going to have to return this.
B00HJ1Q5T8|1|Size extra large was way way way way too small
B001KFYHPS|4|I'm glad it has the elastic waist  I am handicapped and buttons and zippers are to hard to handle  The pants are very comfortable
B00JBYKGKA|1|Product was such a weird fit. Hips were way too tight on my hourglass figure. Neck, chest, and arms were way too loose even with my 36DDD bra size.
B001J54PVU|5|is great, soft, The boy likes to use<br />I recommend it fully, and very good price<br />cute designs,<br />Buy it
B0003DJD0M|4|This is the first time I have ever owned a pair and I like them.<br />I really don't have anything to offer as far as a review of these<br />compared to others on the market. The look good. The only<br />reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the leather on the back.<br />I'm not a huge fan of Leather with name brands printed on them<br />but that is the compromise I made to have this style of Suspenders.
B009GGVTU4|5|Great fit and comfortable!  This is my 4th pair.
B00KAPVCDY|4|Thanks
B00539RK1A|5|I purchased Ben Nye Blood Gel and you have to place in warm water to soften.  Graftobian Blood gel, you don't have to soften, but I did.  The blood gel is the way to go, when you want a realistic looking blood. It dries like how blood should dry, clogged.  It looks real!! I've used it on different halloween makeups for my daughter and it was GREAT!
B00FGBDL4U|3|have to send it back
B00HPLT4PO|1|Awful Quality, please do not waste your money
B00SZHY1KU|5|My son loves this.  He got several the day he ordered this one and this seems to be his favorite! He wears it a lot and loves that it's reversible.
B00DW4NC42|5|if your a medium and wight about 150 get the second size option i wasnt sure i was taking the risk but it ended up fitting. the shirt is nice and see through
B00FLQWRVI|5|Beautiful, sexy, great quality. I purchased the matching bra - depending how that fits, this is a keeper. I have to say the panty is almost the cost of a bra or half the cost...This line, brand is very expensive. Also, 3 is a medium and it fits true to size.
B00BXAQXTS|1|They're cute and i love how you can see everything through the little mesh holes, but WARNING order a size down! They're way too loose! I usually wear a small/xs, but a small to them is like a large-medium!
B0095BJCC2|5|Everyone was commenting on how neat this shirt was. The cuffs, the styling, the collar and overall comfort made this a Hit at the party. Great for going out on the town or casual enough to be worn outside the pant, like in the photo. Stylish and modern with the old school flair that you came to expect wearing a dress shirt like this.
B0043D0S4I|5|I purchased two Alex Stevens turtle neck sweater, one in the mushroom color and the other in black. Even at twice the price, these would be great sweater values. They fit great and the wale of the ribbed cotton material is not too thin and not too thick - a perfect, comfortable fit. They are great to wear casually around the house or underneath a sport or leather jacket for a late fall/winter outing. These are not bulky and the cotton (vs. wool) provide just the right amount of warmth.<br /><br />I liked them so much I bought duplicates of my first order and added the one in heather grey. You can not go wrong with the value and quality of these sweaters. They also wash up real nice. We put them in a gentle cycle and air dried them to ensure they would keep their shape and fit and they did. Can't wait for them to get more in stock so that I can buy a couple more to store away.
B0038JQUQI|4|Very warm but I have little hands so they were a little to big
B00GJAL2WU|4|The pajama set is most satisfactory; I would recommend it highly. The only reason for not giving it a 5 rating is the limited color selection offered. I am specially pleased with the trousers; very soft and warm but at the same time light and flexible. I also like the look on me.
B00J1O2RGQ|4|great costume however it did have some small rips after one wear.
B007N61YHW|5|Possibly the greatest off the shelf kilt in 200 yrs! Shipping, I ordered this on Sunday, talked to the seller on the phone Monday and I am wearing it at 3 Thursday afternoon! What a great product, and great seller!
B00MZBI6NU|4|Too thin!
B00GPAH7M8|4|I'm sure it's not really meant to be a winter warmy, but it's actually pretty well made and fairly heavy. I don't think the design will stand up to more than one or two washings however. It's painted on and doesn't look too durable.
B002K6F7AK|4|I am normally a 36b but I measured 38d for maternity bras. For all of my non-underwire maternity bras I wear a size large so I bought a large in this bra. The bra fits around my torso but I find that my breasts easily slip out when sleeping on my side or twisting/turning when doing stuff around the house. Since I don't wear it outside of my home this does not bother me. The bra is really comfy and makes breastfeeding in the wee hours of the morning easy.
B007FGFHL4|5|AMAZING.  I looked at this REAL leather jacket, with the tacky elastic wristbands and waistband mentally removed.  That's the trick:  take this jacket to your tailor and have them make these minor alterations, and you'll have a very cool, cream cropped leather jacket.  Of if you sew, you can do it yourself.  You do need a shorter zipper then - or just remove it altogether. And yes, it's lined.<br /><br />I'm usually a Sz 14 in jackets, and the 2XL fit really well.  The sleeves are so generous in length that, even with the elastic cuffs removed, they're still long enough.  I bought an extra jacket, in case I wanted the extra leather for a leather waistband or wrist cuffs.  And I got a 3rd one, since $15 if far less than the cost of dry cleaning leather.<br /><br />I wouldn't call the leather \\"butter soft\\", but its texture is not bad at all, given the price :).  In this cream color, the logo/embellishments on the back are really subtle, and add a classy touch. Love the perforations.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION:  Strong buy - if you're willing to make the tailoring changes.
B00WQYZYT0|1|came with unstitched seams, at least 4 sizes smaller than their description , prohibitive cost to return, basically crap
B00D8GZX2I|5|The dress is beautiful and I was impressed with the quality, very nice and soft material. My daughter liked it too; however I realized the flower is quite big and bulky so it is not very comfy for everyday use. I'm thinking of cutting off the flower now so she can wear it more, not just special occasions.
B00DN1EIOW|2|I have several pairs of these Dickies' chef pants, but this most recent purchase (same product/size/color) are made TOO SMALL. I can still wear them, so I'll keep 'em, but they are DEFINITELY not baggies.
B003UNL1LQ|4|This robe is really nice, bluish/grey color, very lightweight - was hoping for something heavier with it being winter, but my dad LOVED it and said it was the perfect weight for layering, so, who am I to judge.
B00CK5FJVI|5|I love underwear in different colors. This was the only brand that offered a large variety of colors at a reasonable price.<br />I bought 14 of them for $35. My only complaint was that shipping altogether was as expense. As long as you are not rough on these they should last a while which is good considering the low unit price. The product itself is great. I feel sexy in them and it shapes my midsection very well. This is a quality product from china. I would purchase from this company again.
B00NUARF6E|5|this shirt is for christmas but I am sure my son will love it
B004DMYMT6|5|These fit well and can hold up to my extra sanitize cycle.
B00MAVTRR4|5|I love these earmuffs!
B00F0TOMCI|3|Not a lot of nipping and tucking. I think there are better waist cinchers and slimmers out there. But if you're just looking for something to smooth you out a little bit, and not suck you in too much this could be right for you. I personally like the ones that give you more of a va-va voom hourglass shape. This isn't it.
B00W8EX3JG|5|Very colorful, great material, elastic snug and well made. I will buy more print patterns.
B00B6EAEU0|5|nice fit, really neat looking even for teens
B00JSA8P14|5|Good and warm
B008LTGOP2|4|I knocked a star off my rating because it does get quite itchy on my forehead sometimes, but it is a very comfortable weight, a great matchable color, and exactly the style/shape I was looking for.  I wear it any time I'm going out, but too lazy to fix my hair.
B003JOSCU4|5|Every bit as beautiful as the pictures on the Internet.  Bought this as a gift because I have one and absolutely LOVE it.  Highly recommend.
B002HWRZJS|5|I can't believe it took me so long to discover Not Your Daughter's Jeans!  The fit and feel are fabulous.
B00P8I5RVG|5|Very happy with this shirt. It fits great and is very comfortable.
B0007XOS7Q|5|The shipment was received quickly and the product was exactly as described.  The cost was reasonable.  I plan to purchase more of these in the future.
B00M40IJVG|5|Awesome! My niece loved it, my sister in law loved it, my mom loved it, I loved it! It looked adorable on her and was so soft and comfy that even a 2 year old like her who seems to find a problem in every item of clothing wanted to wear it! Comes with a hair clip and matching brooch! The seller even had the &#34;hospitality&#34; to send a thank you card that was absolutely beautiful as well!<br /><br />RECOMMENDED!!!!!!
B0085TICTE|5|Ordered one size larger per previous reviews of fitting small - love the pant and will def order more.
B00PU050X2|1|This is a little girls size 12 not even a size 0 for a woman
B00GFLM6PU|5|Wore it on vacation to the islands got lots o.f compliments
B00CBJT79I|5|My mom loves these. She is a diabetic. Colors are awesome.
B00RKZI7N0|5|I was very worried when I first ordered this because I didn't read the description at the bottom saying it only fits size 2 to 12. I'm a size 16/18, 5'9&#34; and these for beautifully on me! I love the pattern and the fabric :) would definitely buy again
B000KD7ZCI|5|I bought this for my grandson's 5th birthday. He Loves trains. I picked this one because it has railroad tracks, he also loves tracks. His first comment was &#34;look, it has a railroad crossing sign&#34; as he pointed to it. I hadn't even noticed that. The white smoke glows in the dark. He loves this shirt!!! It is a little big for him but I expected that. He'll be able to wear it for a couple of yrs.
B005VP16MK|4|I was able to snag these when they are on sale.<br />The material isn't very thick- it's thin and stretchy- however, the jeans seem to hold their shape pretty well.
B00QH9Y3J2|2|The dress is pretty but does not look nothing like the dress on the picture verry diffrent not puffy at all
B001GAGMSW|5|Read
B00R7TH39S|5|Love this dress! Very sexy and still covers all my parts. I ordered a size small. I didn't have a problem with the arm holes. The fabric is very flowy and hangs really nice. I'm a very happy camper :)
B00SCJ0NKS|3|Not quite what I expected, but it's okay for an everyday wrap.
B00DQTOXAK|2|Not a great fit and uncomfortable material.
B007U7XMV0|5|It is simple, cute and very addictive.  Not a predictable plot at all.  Love the actors and story lines.<br />keep it on the air!!
B00IZ7JWHW|5|Very comfortable, love the color!
B008E64Z7G|5|Fun and easy to use.  Just hate that we could not reuse them like other fake lashes.  The feathers pulled apart when we took them off but they looked so good for the night!
B00EOTE9UA|4|Exactly what I expected. Not disappointed
B00DH8KHZA|3|one of the snaps has already broken on the side.
B000WIYHF4|4|The suit is ok.  It did not say Perry Ellis on the collar also it was wrinkled. Other than that good buy for the price.
B00F778MNI|5|Gift good price
B00DP8U40U|5|This coverup is gorgeous in person. The color is much more vibrant and even has lovely bejeweled details. Looks a lot more expensive then it is. I love it!
B00QMS9QD6|5|Love the jacket
B0039824G8|5|These are the only socks I could find that would stay on my daughter's feet. I just love them. The 0-9 months were way too small for my 10 week old, but the 9-18 months fit her perfect.
B00J585BRK|5|Very nice and was a great price!!
B00UY2WFY8|5|I recently received a package of tie bars for the purpose of review from Mens Bodega  and I was really impressed. The tie bars were made of very good quality and come in a variety of 8 in various tones making them Ideal and Ready for any Occasion. From Board Meetings at the Office, Weddings to Nights on the Town.In case you are not familiar tie bars, they should be worn between the 3rd and 4th buttons on your Dress Shirt for a Dapper and neat Look.
B0030BELEC|1|To sum it up<br />a) If you order the product with your waist size then you have to return it as it won't fit your waist.<br />b) If you order a bigger size then it would fit your waist, but would have so few holes that you won't be able to buckle it.<br /><br />So don't buy it!!
B001C929N4|1|The material was very thin.  I could have went to the local store and purchased the same thing and saved on shipping costs.  I didn't care for the velcro closure at the top.  This one, in particular, had a factory defect and it wouldn't close.
B00D5WWRYW|5|Nice and compact for its size. I bought it for the change purse. Would recommend this to others.
B005FUIHUK|5|Humor always appropriate for children and always brings a smile to the face of an adult. Wears well, true to size.
B0077S5EAO|5|It is warmer than my old fleece jacket, yet lighter in weight. This makes it much more comfortable on a  cold, windy day. It also zips up around the neck better than most jackets to help deal with the cold. Not as good as a hoodie, but hoods sometimes get in the way. I used to wear my old jacket indoors, unzipped. This one is too warm for that.
B00K77QP2I|5|The Levi's 514 Straight Fit cords fit as expected. Size perfectly matches the same ones I bought a couple years ago. I ordered the Graphite and Burnt Olive ones. Both colors match the picture. The 514 is not as tapered as the 511, yet it is slightly slimmer than the 505.
B00MHX7CP4|5|This dress is awesome!! Looks a lot like a Free People dress but costs five times less<br />Perfect to wear with a cute bralette for any occasion​!
B009UVEOTS|5|Elastic band a bit tight
B0094VP67S|2|I miss read the description and thought this came with the thigh high stockings. It didn't and I think trying to match it up is going to be a big Hugh challenge.
B006SRTFWI|5|But I am warm wearing these. Thin but warm material, very warm outside (even with the perpetual wind)  but you can go inside too and still be comfortable.
B00LVI96HI|1|Came in pieces, no instructions, so I can't wear it.
B003IBR38A|4|Is heavy to wear but if you use some two sided sticky padding and tie this guy on tight it is somewhat bearable. Lets be honest, you shouldnt be wearing this longer than 15 minutes before its off and you are sippin champagne!
B00564CL1G|5|I have reconstructive surgery. This bra is great. Wide band does not ride up. Most comfortable I own. Highly recommend.
B004L6CFNO|5|Very good quality T. Shirt.<br />During the 1st wash the color bleeds a little... that's natural. As I did not want too much color to bleed, I added a bit of salt in the water and let it soak. Perfect.... :) Next wash hopefully the color shouldn't bleed.<br />Even the shrinkage was very minimal, hardly noticeable.
B008NC0HKU|5|I ordered the Sports Las Vegas bra and realized I needed a different size, customer service was outstanding, before I returned the wrong size they sent me the correct size and it fit perfectly.  With a 32DD it's a tight squeeze on and off, however well worth the effort to keep the girls from bouncing while running.  I tried several brands and others just didn't have the support I needed.  I'm sold on the product and am ordering the other two sports bras to see if they are just as good.
B00GZ0PQMQ|2|I got this cover up and the seams were already ripping and poorly sewed. The material is way thin. I would send it back but its not worth the shipping to China.
B00IE0GML4|4|It is very nice but the size runs something great, the only thing wrong
B0002TOZ1E|5|Just what I was looking for. I've had them before and like the product.
B00TH288I8|5|I was thrilled to see amazon selling these and for such a great deal, I had to order a few in different colors. My wife was getting angry with me stretching hers out and they never fit quite right anyways, so I am so happy to get my own. They are perfect for doing activities or just going out... Two thumbs up!!!
B003GB9KT2|5|My favorite brand of bra.  It fits like spanx with support for the top heavy woman.
B003A8ZL8U|5|Fits well, soft fabric
B0036B0TO2|5|Comfortable. Soft fabric. Fits great
B003E1WZAK|5|super cute mousepad... would recommend to anyone that loves hello kitty... bought a wireless mouse that matches the mouse pad...
B00E4OOOQ4|5|Great purchase
B000HFSLP4|1|It was too large I can't use it
B00MVNME4E|4|A bit too small
B002G9UE1S|5|I have a med-large head and find that the Carhartt hats have a good fit and are also long enough to pull down over the ears without losing much of the bottom fold. I think I own almost every color at this point and I keep a few in each car so I'm never caught without one in the cold ND winters.
B00IOAON24|4|comfortable and light-weight skirt.
B00HX2WBVE|5|I ordered it a little too big but I think it will be ok. It is very comfortable and I love the color.
B000V0EPKK|1|This product's quality sucks. I chose it as a present for my sister, but had to repair the clothes before giving them to her. The sleeve was coming apart at the seam; they forgot to sew the sleeves!!    The sizing chart is all wrong, clothes come bigger than announced.    Definitely do not buy from this seller!!
B000LB5MYM|5|I was apprehensive about buying lounge pants for my husband. No problem with these -- he loves them.  They are cute and very soft.  The fit is good and the fabric is light and comfortable. Our collecting flying pigs means, of course, these are a great find. These are super nice and a very good buy.
B004K30HJC|4|I wasn't able to find my favorite socks by Gold Toe in the nice denim blue that went great with jeans.  In order to get a similar color, I bought these. Much lighter in weight, and I'd be able to do without the tiny 'CK' on them in order to reduce the price!  :-)<br />The quality of them does seem nice and they are soft and comfy.
B00AWB4HZG|1|Can't wear it. It's way too small
B0093X9MZY|2|I saw this coat and really loved the look and the fact that it had a detachable hood. I read the size charts and read the reviews. I am usually a US size M, which in this coat should have been an XL, but I decided that I would go another size larger to make sure that winter clothing would fit under the coat. Even in a 2XL(US L)the coat is tight around the shoulders and chest area. I am only 5'4\\" and 110lbs. I'm not large chested or broad shouldered. I would avoid this coat entirely unless you are looking to make this purchase for a young child. Also, would cost more in shipping to return item than what the coat originally cost.
B00CF6MMKS|5|I am allergic to spandex and I was looking for 100% cotton product, which does not look like from your grandma closet. This one was perfect. It is wide enough, but shrinks a bit after wash. I am very happy with the blouse.
B002HJ377A|5|Once again I beleive in soulmates and true love!!! I've had a run of bad luck lately. my favorite girl in the world who i recntly met on the facebook knew i needed a pick-me-up. she sent me the t-shirt-magnet combo for twice the power.  upon opening the bag a ray of light came over me and i felt warm all over. now she is going to color a picture from her unicorns are jerks coloring book i sent her and i will hang it with my 3 wolf moon magnet! see soul mates!!!! Hope to finally meet her someday!!!!!!!!!!!! hope it's not like that catfish show.
B003U2ZMU8|2|After 2.5 months of wearing 5 days per week, this belt looks like the worn out belt I was replacing. The belt I received is very flimsy and already worn a lot in what appears to be a weak section of the belt. Since I purchased through Amazon, I'm not certain whom to call for a possible replacement. If this cannot be resolved, I will not order another Filson bridle leather belt....no matter the savings.
B004VQ9BKO|5|Nice work pants for everyday use. Tough durable material (jeans like) which would not require regular ironing. Fits perfectly, not too tight on top which is sometimes the case with slim fits (I did buy one size up in the waist) and has a very nice tapered leg space. I hate pants with wide legs that look baggy. These pants were perfect.
B005MXHQXO|5|Excellent value at about $1 a piece. The hankies are also of good size.
B006H1LETM|5|This is a really well made wallet. I waited a few months of using it before I gave this review.<br />It seems to stand up well and is hopefully doing its job of protecting my cards and identity.
B0035K7T4M|5|The slacks were exactly as described. The color, material, and stitching quality is excellent. These appear to be very durable slacks for both business and casual wear.
B00K1ILVHM|2|As the wallet seems to be well made, it really doesn't resemble a carbon fiber pattern at all. I decided on this style as the photos looked like it might and for the size difference, but it just doesn't. It's incredibly stiff and the I.D. and credit card pockets aren't very deep at all and if you put two cards in each pocket, it doesn't close right. Taking out an I.D. or credit card is very difficult given the stiffness and it feels like you have a square of cardboard in your back pocket, but my main complaint is the appearance. If anyone reading this has ever seen anything else made from carbon fiber, (I have a belt, ring, several watches and my phone case that are made from genuine carbon fiber,) it has a distinct and recognisable pattern to it and that just isn't present with this wallet. I'm actually going to be requesting a return.
B00CESF6ZA|3|It did not fit quite right. The material and look were fine, it just did not fit the way I hope.
B0068UBO92|2|Too big and too thick
B00BLR27MU|5|Will get more....also you got any discount coupons for these brand of scrub pants?
B00B2DLKZ8|5|Bought this dress for my daughter's sixth birthday.  She loves butterflies so she really liked it.  It's comfortable and cool especially as we live in a country that is usually hot and humid.<br /><br />The material is cool and fresh.  My daughter is a full six so I ordered a size 8 for her to use now and for at least another year.<br /><br />I am looking to buy another similar one because for quality at that price, who can beat it.
B00ZOZ3I1O|1|this case was seriously so crappy and the white just rubbed away with a scratch. do not recommended. it was cheap & do not spend your money on this.
B00EPF64MO|3|I will wear this but I am disapointed in the quality of the material.  Will it be a rag after a few more washings?
B00422MCVW|5|Its just perfect,the shape, color, size and even the box is amazing
B004CGPIB4|5|I purchased a small sweater and it fits perfectly especially since I am a girl. It arrived one day earlier too so that was good. The logo is a little small but otherwise its a nice warm sweater overall.
B00GK6AEL8|5|cute tops
B004SNL0PE|4|This is a really nice shirt, and goes really well with my interview suite.  It doesn't wrinkle THAT easily but it does wrinkle. The wrinkles are easily removed with a portable steamer.  The fabric is a bit itchy, like one other reviewer mentioned.  But it looks really sharp and it doesn't bother me that much.
B004B8E3E6|1|I bought two scarfs one grey/black and black/blue and i was waiting for them to arrive so bad so after two weeks i felt like it was taking so long so i decided to track them and it said they were delivered one week before but i never got them wich is weird because iwas waiting for some other stuff that same week..that means i was checking out the mailbox every day...
B00OB093AI|4|I love this! Bouhht it for my boyfriend all his friends are jealous!
B00HW5DTDQ|4|They run a size small, but they are very nice. A crisp linen is the best in summer. I love them.
B00AKBLG98|3|Very cute but a little tight.  I'm 5'6 130lbs  pant size26L. Was bummed they didn't fit like I was hoping.
B00O2CB8HQ|5|My fiancee will no longer have a cold neck or hands. Well, at least she doesn't have an excuse now.
B008L44JZ4|5|Handmade and awesome. Vibrant colors throughout.  Very pleased.  This was a gift for the band teacher.  Now I want one for my son.  This product was more quality than I expected.
B00JBD6LCI|5|loved it
B00C6FR08M|4|i like wall flower products they fit well and are well made. They are also well priced I would recommend that others buy their line of jeans and jean shorts
B00JRUUYVO|2|This item was not worth $51 dollars. I got it for almost half off. The second time I wore it, the zipper broke. When I looked to see what mettle it was, it looked like aluminum, which is a poor choice of metals for zippers. The dress itself felt cheep. It looks good and all, but now it I want to wear it again I have to sew on a new zipper. There were also these weird patches on the shoulder with gold colored spikes. I didn't see those on the original picture. Either way, cute dress, but it needs work.
B00NU4YPUE|5|Wonderful
B00MWH3RNG|5|Got these for my 13yr old daughter and they fit perfectly according to her!
B00JE87TNK|2|5  foot 7 and this barely covered my back side.  Short short short<br />I gave it a 2 because of the length.
B0055COZ1I|5|I gave this to my 10 year old little brother as a birthday gift, and he loves it! The shirt came in great quality, and fast shipping and delivery!
B00AG41Y78|1|These were awful and extraordinarily unflattering. One of the few items I have ever returned.
B00ACIGRPM|3|A gift
B000GIQJ06|4|The one-size-fits all take ended up being a little loose (but I'm a smaller woman), but overall they worked out just fine.  I don't think they'd hold up if you were out on the town in them (which they weren't really made for anyway), but they're fun for a romantic evening in.
B00FPEPFZG|3|A bit small...
B00DCKPIPC|5|Love the designs and they fit well. Both daughters (ages 3 & 8) LOVE them!  Note: My 3yr old currently has the size 4 but they do run a bit small so I bought the 6 which fits, but is a bit loose around the waist.
B00CHGOKTM|5|Very nice top thankyou
B00JGTNV70|5|Looks sharp on the camelbak hawg.solid.
B00NEROL92|5|fun and cool shirt.
B004R8Q9G0|5|Very high quality shirt, love the front pocket.<br />Great fit and it's comfortable. It's just what you'd expect from a great company like dickies.
B00IOQLVT6|5|Arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for!  Don't waste your money at a bridal boutique when you can buy good quality veils like this for a much lower price!
B00B4AKTGK|2|when it come to me it's not the same picture<br />it was different i didn't like it :( i wont the one it the pic ..
B000OWGHJM|4|Close, but not perfect. The next size up would have been too big. Oh well, they will do.
B00CM78E5W|5|My son used it when he was 3 months old and still using it (he is over 6 months now). So soft, comfortable, easy to put in and out or change nappy. He wear it to sleep every night and sleep better on it (I think he feel cuddling) easy to go out too as I don't have to change him before we go. Wish they have bigger size as the one we using now getting small
B009M8ZRMM|5|Nice Pajamas!!!!
B000OPI0OO|5|I don't know about anyone else but it is hard to find a good panty that fits well. Panties tend to be a mix bag for me, they are either too small or too big or made of such cheap material that the elastic for the panty wears out in one wash or your panty starts to get holes after washing. I decided to try these panties since they had great reviews and I'm glad that I did, because they are a perfect fit and they are comfortable and I actually got some nice colors. The only complaint I have is I wish you could choose your own colors but I'm still satisfied with the product.
B002Y2B8XK|4|This is a very adorable, very nicely made cosplay hat. All the stitching is very nice and neat. However, the hat is HUGE! So huge that I rarely wear it. Bummer...
B00JALHYG8|5|I loved this. The dinosaurs are so adorable and it a easy to put on and take off him. I liked not having to pull it over his head. Good soft fabric.
B00J1T0X76|1|I actually found this on clearance at a big box store. I bought size 9 months and it was way too small for my boy. The fit was closer to 6 months. Threw it out since it wasn't worth the drive back.
B002FB4QXE|4|I took a chance on this hat and it paid off. It has a substantial weight which you really can't tell  too well from a picture. It is plain like I wanted and fits well.
B00700UE0O|5|The bathing suit is very stylish. I love this style of this bathing suit. I have also used the top and bottoms to mix and match
B008971NSO|4|Good quality for the price. The button did fall off at the end of the day. My son just turned 7 a month ago so I ordered the size 7. Tops fit well but the pants were slightly short. Warning: zip ties DO NOT stay up.
B00NCT3HLU|5|Have not had a chance to use it but it is as expected. Thank you
B00YYNB3ZK|4|It's cute. But not to wear at the gym.
B00KDA4GZC|5|Love it! It's very tight/small, which fits me perfect because I'm tiny, 5'3 103lbs.
B00N7T18X4|3|In the sun, my boyfriend could see right through it
B00E0IKZJY|5|This is by far my most comfortable sports bra. I wear a 38B, and I wear a size XL in this bra. The cups are perfect-- not too big and bulky but substantial enough that I could wear this bra instead of a normal bra on a daily basis if I wanted.
B00E0KYN86|5|Love this. Easy to wear - dress it up or down. Got lots of compliments.
B003BH8Z6K|4|i like this
B00AKC9LD0|2|These are cute, but way too tight for the 2-4T that they are supposed to be. Barely fit my 22m/o. Not only that, but my mom bought a different 6pk of Sketchers 2-4T toddler socks from a local department store and THOSE were also too tight. Bummer. All other 2T socks fit fine with a little wiggle room (Hanes, etc) so I know it is a Sketchers brand problem.
B00H96ORXE|5|👍
B004IZKGTI|5|Great!
