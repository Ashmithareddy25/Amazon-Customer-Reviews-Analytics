B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is the perfect sequel to the Hunger Games. I can't wait to read the third book. Katniss  is a great heroine.
B004NS710C|5.0|I was hesitant on this movie in the beginning, but it was great.  Based on a true story, it depicted the tragedy that can happen when corporate america makes decisions in their ivory tower without consulting or trusting the people that have lived and breathed their jobs for the last 30 years.  Denzel was awesome as usual!  I would recommend this movie!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely enjoy this series! If you like Pride and Prejudice you are likely to enjoy this series! It is full of drama, action, romance... Most enjoyable!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Purchased two of these one to replace my aging over sized 305 and one for the wife.  I have not had any issues to speak of with the function of the watch and the size is great but the touch bezel takes some getting used to and isn't the most friendly thing I've used.  Once you get the hang of it, it's not terrible but I would have been fine with just &#34;buttons&#34;.
0670451495|5.0|Loved the story; did not get a chance to read it to my 3 year old grandaughter yet, though.  Reminds me of the times that Captain Kangeroo had story time on his program!
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|When I heard that a prequel for the Wizard of Oz was being made, I was not eager in any way to see it. Well my stepdaughter came out for the summer, and this was a movie she brought from home. She asked if we could watch it as a &#34;family Movie Night&#34; choice. since I hadn't seen it, I told her that I would have to see it first, to make sure it was appropriate for her sisters to see. I was blown away by how AWESOME this movie was. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this movie!
B003VANOFY|2.0|At first it seemed like it was made in heaven, but for some reason quit working . . .not because the battery was not charged . . . for some unexplained reason.  No help from tech support.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Better than I expected - I need one of those flying machines. I would recommend it, but then I like Sci-fi
0307352153|5.0|easy to read great book great price and also it gives me great insight on who I am and so on.
B001HN694K|5.0|This is another addition to my Johnny Depp collection.  Great movie and I got for a great price.  Love my Amazon.
B00571F26Y|4.0|It was very informative and hit home on a lot of relevant issues. Some of the scientific parts got a bit too lengthy.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I find it is a relaxing way to spend ten minutes or longer.  Skill increases as you play.  I play to let down after a hectic day and it works.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I would rate this as a five star book.  It provides some educational material such as aspects of inheritances and wills.  It describes a very interesting area in South America.  It develops believable characters and has a plot that keeps you wondering what is going to happen.  There is some credibility problem because it seems to want you to believe that there is 11 billion dollars in a bank which is waiting to be divided up, in fact the estate consisted of many companies world wide, all currently functioning, a difficult situation at best with some potential for nightmarish problems in trying to get it all sorted out
B008PUQUJW|1.0|I am not reviewing the movie, I am reviewing the service.<br /><br />We could not watch the movie.  Watched about 1/3 of it, and then for the last two weeks, whenever we try to watch more, we get a persistent network error and Amazon Tech Support can't fix it.<br /><br />Got my money back, but I will certainly not use this service again.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I've read all of Khaled Hosseini's books, and this one was my favorite. It's not always an easy book to read. People don't always behave the way I hoped they might. Things don't always turn out as I would wish. It's like life, and maybe that was the story, after all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Compare to WC and see how much more info you get.  Maps are the best and most active. of any app out there.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It combines temple run and subway surfer in the  short run. Sometimes u have to tilt the tablet in order to complete something .
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Love the game and I think that it will take you back to the day where arcade games where actually fun to  play,  thanks<br /><br />Todd Struve
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting and so easy to play. I can literally play for hours and hours and never get bored. Everyone should try it. It's so much fun. I love the movies and now I love the game.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is what I want real life to be like. Unfortunately, people don't explode into change if I beat them up.<br /><br />&#34;If I could, I'd watch this movie all day long without stopping ever.&#34;<br />&#34;That would make you fat.&#34;<br />&#34;Why would that make me fat?&#34;<br />&#34;Movies make you fat.&#34;<br />&#34;MOVIES MAKE YOU FAT?!?!?!&#34;
B0090KZDSK|3.0|After being left waiting for the 3 book in a sold called trilogy I was so so disappointed with the end. Left open for more perhaps? Well then don't call it a trilogy
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best app I've ever downloaded! I love the graffics, the game play, and all of the unique dragons! No two are alike and you just want to have them all! The best part is this app is available for Idevices too, so you can play it on your phone or on your kindle.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Since the last update, I have lost land that was purchased prior to the update. I started to clear it, put the red hospital on it and now it is not all the way cleared, I can no longer collect money from the red hospital. Also, the cost to expand land has gone from like 92,000 to 760,000 dollars. Did you add a zero by mistake???<br /><br />I do like the game but in order not to have half the town burn down, you need to purchase from REAL cash. If the app is FREE, it should all be FREE. Otherwise make it be .99 cents or $1.99 for the app.<br /><br />Please expand the piece of land I have already paid for!!!
B001TD1XWG|1.0|Imagine sticking a hot metal rod in your ear then getting slapped in the face while you do it. That would be better than listening to this crap. I feel like Lil Wayne should just be put in a mental hospital for saying this is music. His awfully played guitar riffs don't even go with his even worse incoherent auto tuned babbling
1451627289|5.0|As with most Stephen King novels, this book could use some editing, but as with most Stephen King novels, it's a damn good yarn.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's nice accept I have to ask WHAT HAPPENED to 07.2 serisley it's 3 now and u can't spawn mosters yet no wolfs no fish NO fishing rod other wise I LOVE THE GAME AWSOME
B0036BK6MW|5.0|We should all try to follow the example - even if it's only in small ways. The world would be a better place!
1423113462|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever written. If you read the Percy Jackson series your will love this series even better.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I finally watched all 7 seasons,and for me it just got better and better with each one. The last season was a very good ending to a great series...I believe. Great cast!!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game! It is like a mystery search. I would recommend it to anyone who loves to find things.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|It's funny how the tone of this series demonstrates the more immature attitudes of the human species. Being the prequel to Star Trek it probably wasn't too hard to dumb up humanity and play a more naive race. Then again the original Star Trek wasn't too high on the evolutionary scale either :-)
B005OKTPKC|4.0|Grisham gives us an interesting view of what happens behind the scenes of the Courtrooms, the Law Firms and of course the moral of the lawyers. With an easy language he takes us on a road of intense action and nonstop intrigue to reach a great finale...
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I like the kindle a lot. I have been a user since the first kindle came out, and I still use that same reader. I was having to wait around for a friend who was in the hospital and I thought that I would try the kindle app on my phone. Since I downloaded it my phone drains a battery every four hours. This phone is one of those phablet devices from samsung, but I have used it just fine for months. It is actually a nice device for browsing as well. But the kindle app sucks it dry even when I am not using it. It even kills it overnight, so much so that my alarms don't go off. I am going to remove it and i would caution anyone who has a phone for actual phone use to avoid the kindle app.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very entertaining, good graphics,puzzles couldn't, put it down. Can't wait for part two. Have recommended this game to my friends and family.
1401324649|5.0|Lent it out to three other people and they all loved it.<br /><br />Similar to Forrest Gump, when he meets up with world leaders by mistake.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does exactly what it's supposed to do wakes you up and has some pretty cool features different types of clock faces add your own music white noise this is awesome for on the go or at home
0061433063|5.0|Lent this to two other people and they loved it.<br />Loved all the characters and the story line and descriptions of locales.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|it is a blast. The graphics are good and the training program to beef up your fighter is easy. This game is entertaining
B0047SKR54|5.0|HD is outstanding. Great color and sound. I cannot wait to watch more HD movies on Prime.  Keep up the great selection.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|This is  great film and it's fun to watch it with your teenagers.<br />Great acting. Great screenplay (dialog and pacing of the story well done).<br />Loved the opening animation.
1475143389|5.0|Like some of the other reviewers on here, I tried a lot of other programs and workouts designed by trainers, etc. This kicks so much more butt. I have small frame (about 150 lbs), and usually have a really tough time putting on any serious muscle, but I shot up to 175 (in about three months) of almost all muscle. It helps that this book really explains the importance of diet (especially protein and how to do it right). Don't get me wrong--this program isn't easy! It's actually quite a bit of hard work, maybe that's why it works. I'm not looking to get huge, I just wanted to look better at the pool and this book paid off in spades for that. Plus, it's crazy cheap compared to a lot of the books out there! Nothing at all bad to say about this program or the book.
0385335997|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is &#34;on top&#34; of this time traveler series.  The level of research on history, herbal and natural healing, life in the 18th century, superstitutions and a focus on honor, trust, helping others and true love is mind boggling.  Was introduced to the series in 1995 and have read all 7 - and sure hope no.8 is coming out this year.  For a long time I promised myself that I would start at the beginning and read them back to back  - and will begin the final one tomorrow.  Quite a summer read as they are each about 950 pages!  An awesome story: believable, engaging - even better the second time around as you don't &#34;lose&#34; the heart of the story but the details stand out and grab your attention again.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis makes this dry, dramatic movie about a piece of legislation during the Civil War and a brief glimpse at Lincoln the man very interesting and watchable.
B00640UICA|4.0|It's a great game for the little ones. Contrary to the review before me, the network access permission is totally acceptable to my standards.  (It does not detect your location)
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Its all about growing up and the bond between men and that very brief and beautiful period in a boys life before he discovers alcohol, drugs, testosterone and fast women.
1465408681|5.0|My Legos/Star Wars fan son absolutely loved this book. He poured through the pages, looking at all the facts and information about the Yoda Chronicles. We read it together which was a fun mother/son bonding time. It gave me a chance to tell him more about the original Star Wars movies and how they fit into the whole story.<br /><br />He also loved all the Lego Star Wars figurines featured in the book, as well as the sets. It truly is an awesome, detailed book about the entire Star Wars saga. Your little Legos/Star wars fan is sure to love it!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Warning:  This review is rated R and may contain adult themes and language, however, so does the book.<br /><br />I have to admit that the publisher's marketing totally worked on me with this book.  They had me at with the \\"British Bossy Pants\\" buzz (I do so love Tina Fey).  Therefore, going into it, I did not actually know much about Caitlin Moran other than two basic facts: 1.  she's British and 2. she is one cool looking chick!  Now that I am finished with the book, I not only feel like I know a great deal about Caitlin (I'm sure she won't mind if I call her Caitlin), but I am fairly certain that should we ever meet we would be instant BFFs.<br /><br />How to be a Woman is a not only a humorous retelling of bits of Cailtin's life, but it is also a commentary on the current status of women in western society and present day feminism.  It is was interesting how many times I would find myself laughing over her words, only to realize that there was a rather profound point wrapped up in that clever wit.  I have to thank Caitlin for being able to put so many of my thoughts on feminism into words far more eloquent than I could ever achieve and with enough to humor that they just might have a chance of being heard.<br /><br />Yes, Caitlin, I totally agree, it is NOT too much to ask for a woman to actually enjoy an orgasm in porn.  And enough with the shaving!  I support the pro \\"furry muff\\" platform.  You can groom and get good camera shots without creating an obsession with pre-pubescent looking woman parts.  They do not match the ridiculously over-priced stiletto shoes and matching handbags that so many women are convinced they need.  Meanwhile, you'll find me bare foot and shaking a tail feather with Caitlin on the dance floor at a wedding whose debt will likely outlast the marriage.  Cynical much?  Perhaps, but I agree with Caitlin's optimism about women's potential for equality and her view that the responsibility now lies with women to make that change.<br /><br />Beyond her opinions on feminism, Ms. Moran does not hold back when it comes to sharing details about herself throughout the book.  I commend Caitlin for her courage to bare herself to the world to illustrate her many well-made points.  It was refreshing to see someone with celebrity status to be so unapologetically honest about their life.  Sigh, I believe I have developed yet another girl crush.<br /><br />This book has broad appeal (get it - BROAD appeal?) beyond the card carrying feminist crowd.  One could honestly read the book for just the humor and remain happily shallow, overlooking the deeper messages.  That is the point of the book isn't it?  When it comes down to it, it is about the freedom to pursue a life that makes one happy.  Well done, Caitlin.Beyond her opinions on feminism, Ms. Moran does not hold back when it comes to sharing details about herself throughout the book.

B00B7Y0206|3.0|It started out being an AMAZING app, it wasn't working for me to just go onto the web from my kindle, because it said that I needed an update to watch certain videos. So I looked for an app that would let me watch all the videos I wanted. I got this app and it was WONDERFUL, after about a week though it wouldn't even open up for me, so I couldn't get on. I tried turning off my kindle completely, but that didn't work, so I just deleted it. Enjoy it while you can.
031618201X|5.0|Let me begin by admitting that I am not quite sure that I fully understand what distinguishes something as manga or not.  Therefore, I cannot speak to how mangarific this graphic novel may or may not be.  What I can offer is this reader's testimony of sincere pleasure in the manga version Soulless.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of the Parasol Protectorate series from Gail Carriger.  This adaption of the first book, Soulless did not disappoint.  It is a great light version of the original story, yet REM did a great job of capturing the adventure and sentiment of the book.  The manga-style artwork even further captured the whimsical tone that permeates the Parasol Protectorate series.  Facial expressions were really well-done, capturing the essence of the characters in each scene.  I particularly enjoyed the frames that depicted both Alexia and Conall when they were especially aggravated.  The cover art was visually striking, though not quite as appealing as the novel's cover.<br /><br />Obviously, this manga series will appeal to Parasol Protectorate fans.  However, I do think that story is solid enough to stand on its own merit.  Perhaps some manga fans will discover the PP series because of the graphic novels?<br /><br />My favorite thing about this adaptation is that it provides a quick way for me to revisit some of my favorite characters without having to invest the time in re-reading the entire book.  I am eagerly awaiting the manga adaptations of the rest of the series.<br /><br />*This review was originally published on the Silk Screen Views review blog:  [...]
B0091WNK8M|4.0|After a trip to Oregon (and stopping in Astoria / Goonies house), it brought back memories to the 1980s!  Still very entertaining as it was when I first watched it!
B005FPT51K|4.0|I have been using this monitor for almost 2 years now and i love it . Easy to install and beautiful picture . I had an issue after reinstalled it on a new wifi network at my house , i was not able to view my baby on other wifi networks but the iBaby support team helped me solving this issue in not time ,instant replies  and detailed steps to follow . Now i can see my baby anytime and anywhere :)
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|I can't stop watching this show. It is very entertaining. Some violence, well, lots of violence, but the acting is pretty good. It's addicting.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It is funny . I am a compulsive reader and generally books are much better than movies. But this is one of the few where I liked the movie better. The reason is the book takes some life issues that to me are very important, very lightly almost as if there a normal occurrence, such as abortion and homosexuality. In the movie this was pretty much taken out of the discussion
B000FC1MCS|3.0|I had really high expectations, but it ended up being quite flat. I was hoping for a more enticing mystery.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Ok! not so great I expected  much more after reading the book. Many of the changes on the story from the book made the movie to lost the depth it had to it.  Violence against women exists and I feel in this movie it was  treated as less important than in the book.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This is awesome! I love this app! Best farm game I've found for the kindle! I highly recommend it. (add me: DANWRVE) Thanks!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I do not usually go for best sellers but this one I liked. Very well written and a story worth to make a movie . It is very sad but is a reality almost too close to us sometimes.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Some really great moments are included; a number I've not seen anywhere else. For fans and anyone interested in the history of the Beatles this is a great find. Olivia did well by the man she shared with the world.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I like these stories. It gives me hope in a life after this. It helps when loved one are dying.  very nicely written. Greta to have a perspective of a neurosurgeon .
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|While the ending was a bit contrived this is a well done and very enjoyable movie. Great cast and nice directing by Dustin.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I knew one of the casualties from this disasters. I am glad some families were able to reunite. I relived the horror my friend might have felt, now she is in peace.  Great acting Naomi!!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|This movie and its extras met every expectation I had for it. We now have a new generation of Gremlin lovers at our house
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love his writing, I cannot stop reading when I start. He  can tell so many stories in only one book, and then connect them all in a mysterious way.
B00821OX98|4.0|Just plain fun.  I like the references to our founding fathers and the formation of the USA.  Nice to watch with the kids (older)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The movie is amazing , but the book is much better if that is possible. I encourage you all to read it. The insights of how to search for God or the meaning of our lives and souls is immense. There are so many amazing thoughts and discussions that are not  shown with profundity that in the book.
0385474547|5.0|i really liked the condition that the book came in and it was a very good book to read to.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Although I don't have the blue-ray equipment, I couldn't beat the price for getting the DVD I wanted. This is less than the price of two tickets to the movies....
B00000J2PH|5.0|One of the few that reflected original music, true sound and vocals. Enjoy this one, Carole King is a legend.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|but we love it. We first saw it in theaters. For the longest, I had a copy of it on the DVR I think it was.  I was glad when we got a copy of it in Blu-Ray.  We watch it every now and then (fairly often) and never tire of the story.  We remember when the special effects were being raved about ... a long short while before Avatar and other newer generation special effects.  So, when I watch the movie, I think about the special effects that were top-notch at the time.  Even with it's sometimes silly lines.<br /><br />Coffee coffee coffee java java java! (a great line) ... did I quote it right?
B000002GVZ|5.0|good as it was umpteen years ago! Enjoy it,hard to find eleven more words to discribe it. three more words.ach
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I like seeing times past and wish we had more of some of those things in our lives today. The respect and art of being a gentleman and a lady -- having gotten lost over time I think, is neat to see it in Downton Abbey.  We breezed through all three seasons after having heard about them here and there.  Wish we hadn't breezed through them though.  I wonder if we'll watch Season 3 again before Season 4.  There is a Season 4, isn't there? And, no, I didn't like the ending and what I've heard that means.  Too bad.  :(
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use it all the time. It's a great app. I had an old hand-held calculator that wasn't' very good. I threw it away once I got this app.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun to play and easy to stop and pick up again at a later time. Positive = You can never loose!!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|MY SON AND I RENTED THIS MOVIE AN HE LOVED IT! WITH ME WORKING AS MUCH AS I DO IT WAS SO NICE TO ORDER THE MOVIE AD HAVE IT COME RIGHT TO OUR DOOR AT A PRICE YOU CANT BEAT! MY SON WAS SO SURPRISED, IT WAS GREAT! NOW WE CAN ENJOY THIS MOVIE ANY TIME. ONE OF MY FAVORITES FOR SURE! :)
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Great app, the kids love it and so do I. It gets a little repetitious after awhile, but when you come back to it, It's fun all over again.
B001WCN23W|5.0|Yes.  I believe it is (I give it ever so slight an edge over &#34;Let It Bleed&#34;).  Start to finish, it just grabs your ears.  It's more than just the riffs and Jagger's voice.  The guitar work is excellent and most of these songs really stick in your head.  No filler at all and a good bit of variety (whether it's the hard rockin' Brown Sugar or the country boogie of Dead Flowers).
B00DQR26EC|5.0|funny dialog, great skills and spells, nice large world, plenty of parodies yet still serious enough to keep it fun, numerous secrets to find, and sub-quests make grinding rewarding, while not required. All in all, an excellent role playing game for the kindle fire, and the single app I've put the most time into, by far!
B00006AW2G|5.0|Pretty darn close!  Some days I think it is their best work.  Other days I think it's just behind &#34;Sticky Fingers&#34;.  Absolutely love Country Honk!  The 2002 remastering is outstanding.  Sounds like I'm hearing some of this stuff for the first time.  The Stones really crafted some wonderful music during this period.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Pretty wishywashy acting - just average - no really exciting parts did not have panache of first effort - othewise entertaining.
B00006AW2J|4.0|I know many people hold this album up as the Stones best.  In my book it's 3rd behind &#34;Sticky Fingers&#34; and &#34;Let It Bleed&#34;.  But really I guess I'm splitting hairs here as this is a mighty fine album.  The remastering is super.  Some of these songs sound new to me as I'm hearing notes I've not heard before (of course I grew up listening to albums on a pretty crappy stereo).  Sounds really good.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|I bought a used one since the original one for my lens was broken, and this used one is almost brand new and fits in tightly with my old lens. A lens bag was also provided.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome! One of the best books i have ever read and i have read my fair share!! Its a real page turner
1560100842|5.0|This book offers a really nice view of the development of cartoons with rich examples and basic steps to produce them. Ideal textbook for children who really like a variety of cute figures.
B00E95NBNK|5.0|OK, I have some things to admit.  I was a metalhead in my teens.  That was about 30 years ago.  I didn't get what Iron Maiden was doing back then.  I missed their peak years.  A few years ago, I bought Powerslave on a whim.  I loved it.  From there, I dug back through Maiden's catalog.  I stopped at the Seventh Son album.  I figured From Fear... was a good way to sample some of the newer Maiden.<br />To be honest, I really like some of the songs here.  There are a few clunkers, in particular the songs from the No Prayer for the Dying album.  However, you get brilliant songs like Wicker Man, Rainmaker, Paschendale, Different World, etc.  I think Maiden has gotten better with time.  Here are my arguments to that point.  1) Nicko is featured more prominently on 2000 and later albums, aside from Powerslave.  2) The song writing is much better with these later albums.  There were some flashes of greatness in the past.  Beast, Mariner, etc.  But the newer trend of bigger choruses, sing-able melodies and such are great, in my opinion.  This is the secret to Maiden's recent success, in my opinion.  3) The songs have become longer and more intricate.  More changes in feel, tempo, and mood are in these newer songs.  I guess this makes Maiden more prog-rock.  Whatever you want to call it, it makes the songs more like stories.  And that, to me, is entertaining.  And maybe that is what I finally found in Maiden's music.  And I find it more consistently in the 2000 and later albums.  I love the 80s Maiden now.  Don't get me wrong.  But the things I liked back then are more honed and more implemented in the newer work.  I need to buy the newer albums.  I will avoid No Prayer, but will start with Fear of the Dark and move right on to Final Frontier.  I think maybe I will find some gems they didn't put on From Fear to Eternity.
B003JR1JV0|4.0|cd arrived on time and un damages just as described sealed package. came with all the extra tracks on the cd as well. cant be tamed is the hit on this record.
B001202LRM|4.0|To paraphrase The Most Interesting Man in the World;<br />I don't always listen to Slipknot, but when I do it is this album.  This album had a spark the others don't.  Maybe it was all the side projects that took something away.
B0053O89IS|5.0|came as described, no damage, no scratches. such a fan of this show. a must buy if you a fan.
B0011Z1BQK|5.0|If you like Zep and you don't have this, get it.  Some really good songs here that don't get much radio play these days.  Just get it.
B0047CN1MG|5.0|I loved the show so far. I did not realize it had ended its run. Still look forward to watching the rest of the seasons. It really did just dawn on me as Newton died/was deactivated in this episode that he started out as a head in season one(?). If he was a head without a body, how can he have a be a real shape shifter which have their brains in their butts as they do in this episode. Oh well, it is still or was a good show even with this anomaly -- it would be \\"Fringe\\" worthy without one of those.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|This is just awesome.  I wish I had bought the version that had the rehearsals on it.<br />The band is amazing.  John Paul Jones steals the show at times and I think that is great.  Jimmy is classic Jimmy.  He will play so brilliantly one second and then muff the next.  That is classic Jimmy Page.  Robert can still sing.  Period.  and Jason put in a show that would have made his father proud.  I hope they do a tour.  Please.<br />Many, if not all of the songs are a whole step flat of the records.  I imagine that was to make it easier for Plant to hit the high notes, but it adds a really cool vibe to the music.
0345529057|3.0|I like the story of these books, but this particular release is not an ideal printing. It looks like it was rushed out at cheap cost because the paper quality is low, and some of the pages are not secured properly. In addition, the pages are too narrow for the thickness of the book, so the ergonomics of holding the books can be a little annoying. However, they are a good size for reading on the go, so it's a wash. I would have been happier spending a little more for higher quality printing though.
B004W1GCQO|1.0|Jean March and the writers and producers of this sequel should be ashamed of themselves.  It's awful!  It falls to the level of a bad soap opera and lacks the nuance of the earlier series.  I got the feeling that it was trying to compete with Downton Abbey as many of the plot elements were almost identical but not nearly as well done.  If bad soaps are your thing, you'll have a blast with this but personally, I turned it off half way through the 2nd episode.  Not worth the money.
B002Q0F6V0|4.0|Hey, what can I say, I put a few songs from this album on about every week. As a fan from older AIC, I do dig this.<br /><br />I watch the Browns even though they change Quarterbacks. I enjoy them. I root and and enjoy AIC even though they changed a singer.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Recommended to anyone seeking purpose in life. This is a book you will read more than once. Bud Connell, Author & Novelist
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Hilarious movie!  I would even watch it again because it was really funny.  I have to write seven more words.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I found this in the app store and found it easy to use on my kindle.  Signing in online is also easy.  I do find it a bit easier to add new blogs from the computer,but for surfing my faves on the kindle this is awesome.  Finally a good replacement for my Google reader!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Our new favorite game, they come running home from school and beg to do their homework so they can play it first. Definitely a keeper in our house
B00499NHLC|5.0|A great update on Sherlock Holmes and Watson. Fantastic acting, smart writing and so much fun. My new favorite show!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|When you read this book, you will discover that there is some magic out there !! Enjoy it, very recommendable. I hope to find some more books like this one.
B0081336FO|5.0|Such a wonderful follow up to season one. Cumberbatch and Freeman just keep getting better. Smart is the new sexy.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Best cop drama since &#34;Prime Suspect.&#34;<br /><br />Americans will once again screw up their version.<br /><br />Like it here much more than commercial laden TV version.  Also, like the caption option (those accents are sometimes tough to understand).
0385736002|4.0|We got this set of books for our daughter for Christmas & I think she liked them. I didn't personally read them so I can't comment on that.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, highlighted challenges facing many companies today.  It was done as a story, which made it an easy and enjoyable read.
B00110K62U|5.0|This production is done so well and stars Colm Wilkinson as Val Jean!! I've seen the Broadway play several times and this is equally as wonderful even though it's not done as a &#34;stage play.&#34;
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book is very good but at times goes on a little too long with certain stories. I love how it all comes together at the end.
B0068RHSCW|5.0|I love this movie even after I've seen it several times. The story line is really good and believable and I like Daniel Craig to boot!!!
B005VOXOYO|5.0|Good quality.<br />I gave it to a cancer patient---because St. Peregrine is the patron saint of cancer.  It was something different
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|Not too bad for the price....glad we didn't pay full price at the theater but still glad we rented it
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a fantasy novel, but delves from many of the tropes found within the genre usually. While most fantasy character that come from humble beginnings have a guide of sorts that helps them from beginning to end, Sabriel embarks on her journey alone, and spends most of her adventure with little help from the Old Kingdom she is setting out to save from the Undead. Likewise, Sabriel has a very small cast of supporting characters. Sabriel embarks into the Old Kingdom, fancying herself a powerful mage and skilled fighter, only to come to the stark realisation that she is woefully under prepared for the task her father has left for her, and is continually humbled. Garth Nix creates a vibrant, yet understandably bleak world in the Old Kingdom, a place that has had no King for over 200 years which has lead to decay and chaos across the country. With only a few snippets of actual life across this land, Garth Nix shows the reader the degree of what has happened, and what needs to change for everything to be set right.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Tom Cat saves the human race...again. His dream girl is anorexic. The only black man alive gives his life to save the white people.  Barely an original word spoken here. Also , I had the keep turning the volume up and down because the soundtrack was give times louder then the acting.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|great show worth the listen. so get it an jam out at home or car. worth every penny you spend.
B002WV5A9G|2.0|I finally watched a star trek since the original show and found it over produced, badly written, and typical macho<br />BS.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It keeps my thinking skills active.  I like it. Sometimes the moves seem obvious, then you try it and when it doesn't work you have to problem solve.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Quite possibly the most profound, absorbing, introspective, and brilliant creation in modern fantasy literature out there right now. Look at this book's reception and how many languages it's been translated into. It's not a coincidence. If you haven't read this book, you should.
B002ZG97EC|3.0|Movie was ok.  Expected more.  Really just one plot dragged out throughput the movie.  To me, doesn't compare to a Disney made movie.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|First off, know that the writer is a original episode fan, and have seen every episode of all 3 seasons more than I count.  This movie reminded me of the writing that made the series so special back then. Excellent character development, fabulous villain, and a terrific mix of effects, humor, and good acting all add up to a fun couple hours even if you aren't a sci-fi fan. Bought in HD. My only knock is AMAZON video on demand.  Buffering interrupted the movie at least 5 times, and after many emails to them without a reply they don't seem to care. I pay extra for turbo internet every month, so I know it isn't my connection. Anyway, great addition to the line of Star Trek movies.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Paul Newman and Robert Redford were one of the greatest screen duos of all time, with this film and its follow up, The Sting. However, I must say I prefer this film to the latter as it is much more dynamic and exciting.<br />This film is able to tip toe back and forth being heartbreaking and side splitting with ease, and that is something not a lot of films are able to do so successfully. This is due in large part to the talents of screenwriter William Goldman, who also wrote their follow up project The Sting, and the superb screen adaptation of Misery. The dialogue in this movie is so astonishing, it could have been just Newman and Redford in a cardboard box the entire picture saying these lines, and it still would have been worth the price of admission. This film in many ways gave birth to more wise ass heroes like John McClane, Ash Williams and even the recent take on Iron Man. You can see a lot of the same humor in Butch and Sundance with its sharp and perfectly timed wit that causes you to let out a chuckle amidst the action.<br />The best part of the movie is a 40 minute chase scene where Newman and Redford are relentlessly chased across the west by a posse of seemingly superhuman lawmen. This section of the film is actually a bit atmospheric and creepy, its feel offset by the funny dialogue between our two heroes. It comes to a climax with the famous cliff jump scene, which provides one of the biggest laughs in the movie.<br />The film is still a sad one in spite of the frequent chuckles it delivers. It is in many ways like The Wild Bunch, and signifies the end of an era, where modern civilization slowly destroyed the freedom that the colonial days offered. A natural progression, but progress has a price. Of course, when the inevitable conclusion comes, there has to be one more laugh in it for good measure to prevent you from leaving with a sour taste in your mouth.<br />I am baffled that Roger Ebert didn't see the merit of this film, but then again film critics have often has severe missteps in judging what is good or bad.<br />The two disc edition is great, with a great picture and a boatload of features, including multiple full length documentaries for film and history aficionados out there.<br />If you like character driven stories with a lot of heart that combine great humor and a good story, this is a must see. It has aged like a fine bottle of wine.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I liked the first person narrative of the first jack reacher novel, but this story was equally as entertaining as THE KILLING FLOOR
B000UJCALI|5.0|One of the most controversial movies in Stanley Kubrick's lexicon, The Shining polarizes fans of the book and film a great deal. It is, to say the least, not very true to the original novel by Stephen King, and becomes a totally different story unique to this version. So how is it as a movie?<br />It is a masterpiece. Kubrick is one of the greatest film makers of all time with such classics as 2001, Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange under his belt. The Shining is probably his most accessible movie for a general audience. I first saw this film when I was 13, and even then I was aware it was something special. That and I always wondered just what the movie playing during the drive in scene from Twister was. What Kubrick does is rather than simply adapt King's novel verbatim, he tweaks it to make it something uniquely his own, only using King's novel as inspiration for his original take on the story. This will understandably upset a great deal many people. I am a King fan myself, and have enjoyed many of his books and film adaptations. But tweaking a story can improve it in certain ways. The film alterations of The Shawshank Redemption have since become signature parts of the story, and that film is universally loved. The Shining should receive a similar reception.<br />Jack Nicholson delivers one of his signature performances in this film as the slowly unhinging Jack Torrance, an oddly sympathetic but thoroughly frightening villain. Ol Jack always was a trooper with acting, creating a variety of colorful characters from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to Five Easy Pieces. Here, he delivers one of his more crazy performances and it is a treat to watch. The rest of the cast, Duvall, Crothers and Lloyd, do very nicely. Lloyd especially delivers a turnout performance as Jack's frightened son in probably the best performance by a child in a horror film.<br />One of the most interesting parts about the story (book and film) is the setting. Isolating the characters was always effective in horror stories such as Alien and The Thing. Like the latter, this film uses the cold and snow to cut off the characters from just walking out the door. It really makes the hotel become not a beautiful mansion, but a spooky maze from which there is no escape. The choice of hotel for both the interior and exterior was just fabulous, and allows for many great images to be created on the movie. And it is just perfect for building atmosphere.<br />The film varies in just how it creates fear. First, it is fear by suggestion, with creepy images and dark shadows that slowly build a sense of dream. One of the creepiest moments in the film is when the young Danny is lured into room 237 whilst playing in the halls of the hotel. This scene boasts a minimalist score, some oddly symmetrical images that are somehow very unsettling, and it draws out the scene to the point that it is almost torture. Not until the final third does Jack become the mad axe man, and the film dispenses with its sense of dread and opens the floodgates into total terror. It is this section of the film that most people remember, and it is not hard to see why as it is very well executed. However, the two thirds before that are also something to see. Who knew a kid looking down a hallway could look so damn creepy?<br />The two disc DVD delivers the good with a host of features, including the classic trailer for the film and the original documentary from its original release date. Not a lot of new material, and that is kind of sad, but still great stuff.<br />If you are a Stephen King fan, just remember this. This is not a Stephen King movie. It is a Stanley Kubrick movie. Don't put it in with the book, and view it on its own merits. If you are able to do that, you are in for one of the best horror films ever made.always effective in horror stories such as Alien and The Thing.

B007AL48UK|5.0|Have always liked this game and this one is not a bad version of it. will give many many hours of fun I am sure.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I loved how I could order and get it without paying for shipping! Plus I ordered the second season as a preorder.<br />I stayed up all night with my best friend watching it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|works just fine...only thing is I am a heavy sleeper so would not hurt if it could be louder...but I think that is the kindle not the program.
B009RX85N0|5.0|We woke the whole house up watching it all This was the bestest movie we both have ever seen. You gotta see it! Got others watching.
0786958731|5.0|Once I opened the box and unpacked everything I was ecstatic. The tiles are nice and thick so they should hold up well to countless replays. The mini's are great and as far as I can tell, it's all compatible with the RPG game. I foresee me running encounters and campaigns using the components from all 3 boxes. Great buy.
B00CW665VI|3.0|I sooo looked forward to reading this but when it came down to it, I wondered what all the hype was about.  It was a good storyline, good characters and a lot of male humor. I guess it just really wasn't my kind of read like most of the &#34;male&#34; told stories I've read.  If you don't want to buy it, I'll lend it to you...don't waste your money...

B005PK56TA|5.0|Love the cast, but that house!!!! I want to watch it over and over just to discover any amazing woodwork, stained glass, Art Deco, mid century furnishings - oh my - that I may have missed previously!
B000QCQ8XA|3.0|Writing style is light and amusing. The situations that occur are very relatable and believable. The family dynamics are the strongest feature of the story.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I felt that I was on that mountain top with PO1 Luttrell and his team. They are true heroes ot the extraordinary kind. The detail of his book puts you right into the fight. I felt the rush, exhilaration, doggedness, and at times the hopelessness. In the end our U. S. Navy SEALS prevailed and stood true to their Honor and left no man behind. God bless them and may God protect them at all times..
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|absolutely love Justin Timberlake and i was one of the many people anticipating his return to music. definitely not disappointed with this album, but i have my favorites and least favorites.<br /><br />i think the overall mood of the record is very chill, easy listening. good mix of midtempo/slow songs. favorites include Mirrors, That Girl, Blue Ocean Floor and Let The Groove Get In. i actually love the live version of Pusher Love Girl from the VMAs better than its recorded counterpart. least favorite is definitely Suit &Tie--didn't like it when it was released, and still didn't like it when i bought this album.<br /><br />i feel like all the songs are super long, which i don't mind since the endings are pretty good-- particularly on Mirrors, Strawberry Bubblegum and Pusher Love Girl.<br /><br />overall, i give this album an 'A'....looking forward to the follow up to this record.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|My wife and I love this movie.  It's a great combination of action and comedy. We are really looking forward to Red 2!
B006KX3GXO|3.0|Nothing great. It really didn't do what I wanted it to very easily. Seemed hard to navigate. I probably won't use it much.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Fast paced, easy read. I really enjoyed this book. My only wish is that I had read this before &#34;The Hit&#34;.
B0018M6J90|4.0|Oh, this is such a darling movie.  It has everything-romance, humor, friendship and Frances McDormand (as always) plays her role and looked the part perfectly.  Just a great actor.  Amy Adams was so cute and I think this is my favorite role I have seen her in.  I saw it on cable and ordered it right away!<br /><br />DJD-Wheat Ridge, Colorado
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I chose a FIVE STAR rating because this book is a awesome book everyday people and disabled people can be encouraged by. I love how this book is broken down in to parts. Even though this was a book report to do , I still recommend this book to anybody who is willing to relax but still have fun:)
B004YOEFG8|5.0|Hubba Hubba Hubble!!This DVD is great..The color, the sound, the whole thing is well worth the price.looking for the next one.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|its really fun game you get to make stuff like a house but u have to hurry cuz they only give u like ten minute I think the real version is too much money please make it two dollars amazon please I am begging you thank you bye now
B008Y5UADK|1.0|Boring.  We quit watching it after 15 minutes so maybe it got better later.  It was a bit over our heads.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey's biography is very readable and interesting.  It is funny, insightful and informative.  Her advice, while light, is relevant.  It gives we ordinary folk a glimpse into the world of entertainment.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is fun you can name and build your own city. I play it for hours a day. I get nothing done is the only bad thing. Fun game!!!!!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|People can be very brave no matter what hand life deals you.  Do you love or do you walk away?  What would you do if one moment you were everything a man wants to be and the next you became a quad in pain and desperate depression?  What if you find love at the last moment?  Is it enough to make you see life differently?  Will Traynor faces those questions head on and he is very brave in how he deals with the consequences.
0553801473|2.0|I was forced to put the book down halfway through and skim Amazon reviews in hopes of motivating myself to finish it. As I suspected, the majority of fans are just as upset as I was with the lack of progression, abundance of pointless chapters/characters, and GRRM's obvious and painful decline (for whatever reason). I understand an author's need to establish a set-up for the final two books of an epic series, but this has become unbearable. Reading this book became a chore for me, something I would have never imagined. At this point, the Winds of Winter will have to be better than his first three books combined if GRRM plans on redeeming himself and saving this story. Unfortunately, this seems highly unlikely. I'll stick to the HBO series and hope they deviate entirely from AFFC and ADWD (or risk being cancelled altogether; seriously, this is how slow and frustrating these books have become!). It's a shame that George has struggled tremendously in finishing up this wonderful story of his.<br /><br />With all that being said, I sincerely hope he proves us all wrong.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It works exactly as one would expect. I wish it had fewer pop up ads. Graphics are very nice. Auto complete is nice too. A quick click on the card will place the card saving time dragging and placing the card manually. Lots of fun!
0385349947|1.0|Terrible paper quality, I do not think I can keep in my library for a long time,this book is obtained in bookstores for less than $ 24 in very good presentation and paper quality
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just love making boards and seeing who repins my pins. The app is just as easy to use as the site. Love love love it. I can spend hours just looking  up stuff to repin. I get so many diy ideas and so many really good tutorials. My house is gonna be so awesome.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|A great Star Trek movie. This is one of those sci-fi movies that transcends its genre. This reboot might just save the franchise.
B00006FDCD|3.0|Maybe I was expecting too much. It was just weird, not scary.  I WANTED to like it but it's just....weird.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 15 month old son loves this movie, we even went to see despicable me 2 at the movies, He loves watching the minions, every time they say something he cracks up. My husband and I love watching it with him, I've already seen it 6 times since getting it few days ago.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie is very informative & has changed my life 3 years ago.  I now have extra copies to lend so we can spread the word cause it save me the hassle of having to explain all this to 'non-believers' lol.<br />THANKS &#60;3
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|I officially have all the songs memorized. Buy this and your girl will love it (but the songs going around in your head 100 times might not make you happy!)
0425263924|5.0|Great third book.  Now that I'm hanging on the edge wondering what is going to happen next, I'll &#34;patiently&#34; await the arrival of the fourth book.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|My husband and I both watch this show every night.  We are absolutely addicted, sometimes watching two or three in a night.  The plot is intellectual and the sub-plots are always engaging.  We are now on the third season and even more involved than when we started.  In my humble opinion, this show is at the top of it's game.  Watch the first season and I'll guarantee, you are hooked.  If there were an Olympics for TV series', Suits would most definitely be in the running.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|One of the best books I have read this year. Great story of how one dealt with the life she was given and did great things with her situation.  I have a love of flowers too and intrigued how  she used her passion and love for flowers to relate to people.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|It works...I love it and being free is one of the best things about it. Although I would pay a price for it.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|All of the daily market info that I need seems to be available.  Prices, volume of activity, news, trends its all there.  Best bussiness app I have seen.  Thanks.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Love it. Best game ever. So easy to fly. I hate video games, butt I love this game. U have to get this game right now!!
B006RXPUR2|5.0|The movie kept my attention the entire time, stayed interested.  I would watch it again, and highly recommend it.  Excellent
B00DCX08MW|3.0|I like it. But it is easy to play. The only bad thing is that they are WW2 plans. I want to fly a f-16,f-17,or f-15.<br /><br />M
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Total cheesy dude flick. Unrealistic and formulaic. Sean Penn gives a strong gangster performance but it is so out-of-place with the rest of the movie it's almost comical. Not to mention how Hollywood-ized the whole production was. 2/5 stars
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like so much Cubistry, because makes my mind work. Fill my spare time and keeps me active. I love it
B00129H7VS|5.0|this series really shows and tells what the WW2 was like for the soldiers involved. moving, informative, thrilling, historically accurate
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Everyone in our family plays this game and loves it - even our four year old like to connect the lines. Great game for road trips.
B000JJRIP2|2.0|After reading all the comments about this set, I wAs looking forward to replacing some missing cd's from my past, and augmenting my collection.  Many owners spoke of the booklet within, and I was really looking forward to that.  NO BOOKLET AND SKIPS ON TRACKS. I was very unhappy.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Absolutely brilliant, riveting, interesting story.  Actors are fantastic.  Amazing scenery.  Great music.  I'm totally addicted.  I'll be sick when it ends.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|The opening scene was disgusting, therefore I didn't watch much of it. It's too bad because I love the topics of birth, babies and families.
1601252463|5.0|New classes are well writen. Very minor clarifications needed here and there (easily found in paizo forum). The new classes work very well with the existing pool of classes. A lot of options from the archetypes, almost creating entire new classes from existing ones. Very balanced new feats, closing some gaps on some classes from core. Awesome idea with character traits! (Background events that help customize your character with some minor, but useful, bonus, like one extra class skill)<br /><br />Recommended.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|This totally could happen, except the Bible does not explain the end of human society like this.  The earth will remain and not be distroyed as protraited in this movie.
1601251505|5.0|Even for a 500 page tome, the rules were simple and logic, making the game flow well. Every character class has some level of choices to make and customization. Very above D&D 3.5, ages in front of 4.0(wich was a stepback).
B003CI90MQ|4.0|provided the overview I wanted. Would recommend to novice.Ran out of additional words that I want to use here.Goodbye now
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome, love it. My sister love it too.<br />But there's. only one thing it is awesome game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|So much fun!! Really made me use my thinking cap. Made me pay attention. Challenging yet very, very, very, very fun
0786838655|5.0|My son isn't really into the whole Sci-Fi thing... or historical fiction... that's just him... but he did enjoy the characters and story format.  I explained a lot of the historical aspect of the book so he could understand it better.  That helped him and he was very engaged, something not typical for him and these type books... he'd much rather be reading mysteries than fiction... the fact that we read it together was one reason he got &#34;into it&#34;.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|this is such a touching book. I read the end multiple times. I also let my friend read it and she was on the verge of tears. :) great job again john green!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I hadn't read any of his other works, and this was a book club assignment for me.  Most of the members had already read at least The Kite Runner.  They raved about it so I was expecting a lot.  I'm a very insightful reader, but this seemed very unfocused to me from the start.  I really  had to push through it, but then once we got to Nabi's story, it began to make more sense.  The same with Pari and Nila.  Then it began to flounder after a while until the reunion of Pari and Abdulla.  I could barely read through the first part of Markos' story, until he became friendly with Thalia.  The other stories were interesting, but their connections to the central characters were thin.  You didn't have to beat me over the head about the themes of &#34;appearances are not always what they seem&#34;, and self-serving intentions.  At least after all this, the author could have rewarded us with a more satisfying ending.  If Abdulla had died just before Pari arrived, it would have at least been dramatic.  Well, at least Pari seemed to get something out of it, and young Pari was able to start a new life with the original Pari, as hers was starting to decline.  Not a bad read, but I had hoped for something much better.
B00736ZKGS|5.0|I bought this. I love one direction. and this movie just brings back all the memories from when I went to the concert.
B000002GHH|5.0|With Ry Cooder , Jim Keltner & Nick Lowe, ( then came Little Village), Hiatt shines. I just wish they would do another one. Highly recommended.
0439023521|5.0|love this book as much as i love the movie. read the entire series in 1 1/2 days and i dont regret it
B00932A4XE|4.0|I wanted to see this for some time but was nervous that it was going to not be at all funny. I liked it. It was witty and followed numerous story lines but tied in to each other very nicely. It showed the &#34;not so perfect&#34; moments that everyone thinks of when they think of pregnancy. I wouldn't make my significant other watch it though unless we were actually expecting.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|One of my fav games. Tournaments...friends who can send gifts and lots more. Love it! Some crazy points when you win.
B003719GGS|5.0|Extremely helpful manuscript!  Tried some of it and believe it or not it really works.  Should have read this book years ago.  Passing it on to friends and family.
0446555002|5.0|Preston and Child are probably my favorite authors. Looking forward to reading this book during my upcoming vacation!  I was told that I needed two more words before I could Submit this review.  Hope this does it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is awesome it's fun and addictive I try and put down and I can't . Everyone should play this game and try to run a city
B00847KFDS|4.0|Fogerty did a great job remaking his old songs and adding new vocals from some other great singers.... knowing Bob Segar was on the record sold me.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|very good. the villain (I don't want to spoil) was amazing. I am looking forward to see movie # 3. Maybe they do a remake with Kor and Kirk.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a very inexpensive game, so I didn't mind that I finished it so quickly. I look forward to future games like this. It had a &quot;Myst&quot; quality to it (which I loved), but not as time-consuming.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Great research on Jesus. Aslan brings a new perspective on one of the most famous persons of all times. A must read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game but not enough levels. Can't wait for new update.<br />Hope they come soon, I have played these same 10 levels over and over.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of the best games I ever played. I recommend everyone to get it. I love bananas and minions. Can't wait to see the movie.<br />I hope it's really funny.
B004SIP7TE|5.0|As a native New Yorker, this movie was excellent at portraying the historical beginnings of lower Manhattan which (when I was growing up) was the worst place to live or visit. Today, you can't buy any real estate in that area for less than a million.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Excellent book! Very well-written and, not surprisingly, very well-researched. The only thing that bothered me was the repetitive nature of certain passages, but I guess I needed two-three of those repetitions to fully understand the mechanics of what the author laid out as the relationship between the underlying mortgage loans to bonds to CDSs to CDOs back to CDSs. It also felt like the book's protagonists were basically at the core of the financial unraveling, which I still doubt is true. It is just hard to believe these 3-4 people were the catalysts or were the only guys &#34;in the know&#34; of what was really going on. Call me Thomas, I don't buy it. But it makes for a good storyline. I will definitely try and read some of Lewis's other books on the subject ('cause I have no interest in baseball and other some such esoteric, American things).
B00CBVRGIK|2.0|has a modern 80's sound but doesn't hit the mark and nothing grabs your attention.there's really no catchy songs on this mediocre cd.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Began as an informative book based in science, degenerated into a \\"self-help\\" triviality. Also, the \\"cue - habit - reward\\" structure seemed to be forced onto certain scenarios described in terms of company-wide or social changes that occurred in real life. E.g. the Rosa Sparks story. I think the initial frame of analysis is more suitable or is better applied in terms of individuals' behavior rather than macro patterns. It is OK to look at companies though, as there you could solidly proceed from micro-analysis to macro-changes. As for national behavior and such, I am not convinced a simple analysis like the one in the book can explain away everything.
B00B6OEDS4|2.0|nice vocalist but,there's really no memorable tunes here,doesn't quite hit that mark,lacks any kind of hooks...nothing catchy! maybe next time.
0385523394|3.0|This was federal prison, not exactly the horror story I expected.  State prisons are a different story.<br />The author is a lucky person as she had support and a job waiting for her.  Most people don't have those options.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|That book was just incredible. I think I'll read it again. I just feel like I learned so much from that book. Officially one of my favorites.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|Ok, well went into watching this with much hope and after I read a few reviews and the story was about Khan's early existance and history I was excited. I enjoyed the first STAR TREK in 2009 reboot. Was very good actually. But, that being said I wanted so deep story lines and character development and It didn't develop.<br /><br /> I knew about Khan from the first season of the original star trek in the 60's. I watched it and payed attention to detail and the things he said in that lone episode. I also watched Star Trek II: the wrath of Khan when it came out and is one of my all time favorites and also payed attention. I believe a story needs to coherent and connect. I was waiting the whole movie for a specific point where all two previous episodes connected and made the story and gave you a \\"ah huh moment\\" It never came and it left more questions then answers. Really made me ask what did I just watch? One trend I have noticed about films these days are the lack of story and meaty plots and all we get is CGI special effects. Well, it might fly with kids and teens, but people like myself that recognizes a good movie for having amazing story plots is what creates a great film.<br /><br />  This filmed lacked real plot and depth of that plot to know your characters and get entangled in their emotions and history of who when where and why? Didn't have it. The overall plot of the film is simplistic and I get it, but it never covered the real nature of who Khan is and why he did what he did?<br /><br />In the 60's TV episode, Kirk saved Khan and pulled him out of cryostasis and didn't know who he was? Then he defeated him at the end of the episode and banished him to Seti-Alpha 6 with his new babe Marla. This is where J.J. Abrams hopes you don't have a brain and never watched the original stuff. Then in Star Trek II Khan escapes seti-Alpha 6 and goes after Kirk, fine and great and a well scripted film. Star trek into Darkness left out key information about who Khan is andin the end of the film showed him going into cryostasis but no mention of the starship S.S. Botany Bay, which found him in the 60's TV episode. Kirk dies in the film and is revived by Khan's blood? That is kinda silly and the director tried to make strong correlation to the original movie in 1982 when Spock saved the Enterprise and avoided being blown up. You also meet Dr. Carol Marcus and very limited plot development there too. Overall, you'll enjoy it but it won't make sense. Unless J.J. Arbrams is leading us into another chapter of  Kirk and Khan showdown I'd be surprised. Ok movie, but lacking in so many areas. If your a kid and you never saw the original stuff...I'm sure you'll love it. But for old school movie goers who know good film. I don't buy it!!
140006922X|5.0|An excellent book that presents what the world of men, politics, law, social groupings, and national tensions very well in a very quick, easy-to-read format.  It certainly filled in well for what times looked and felt like for Jesus and his contemporaries.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It does everything I need it to do, and is so much easier than using the browser version on a handheld device.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Once in a while I have to relent and watch a Romantic Comedy with my wife. We have a few &#34;go to&#34; favorites, and this is one of them. We watch this about once very six months. The plot is original, and genuinely funny. Two scenes are just too stupid or too gross to watch so we fast forward those (chanting in the woods and the stripper scene), but the rest of the movie is great.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Not a bad game but can get boring after awhile.  Good clean graphics but had to turn off the volume because music was annoying.  Will probably delete game soon because I'm already losing interest after a few days.
006178480X|5.0|I loved this latest from my favorite author James Rollins<br /><br />I don't know where Rollins dreams up these great themes and then delivers them with such suspense and drama time after time. PS: I just learned and read his &#34;secret&#34; other world of the fantasy world that he writes under another &#34;name.&#34;  See if you can find it for yourself. You'll be rewarded with a whole other dimension of his skills and adventures!!
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I love math puzzles and have been playing them since I was a kid in Games Magazine.  I discovered Sudoku in one of their issues and liked them at first, but grew to love them over time.  My first video experience was playing on the Nintendo 3DS.  I liked it ok, but the timed element took a lot of the casual enjoyment out of it for me.  For some reason, the Summer Sudoku video version of Sudoku has really hooked me.  It works really smooth for me and is a lot of fun.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I saw the movie first by chance a few years ago when it came out. But this book is amazing, a great read, great story, great characters, wonderful.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Good but not great kinda boring but I must finish the series. Lol also I didn't like the ending not that exciting
B007AL48UK|4.0|Its mahjong, simple fun entertainment. I may pick up the other seasons because lord knows i hate playing the same game twice
B0068LYEHA|5.0|At one point I actually cried with tears. However, the anecdotes that will make you laugh out loud are also there to provide examples or make a point in a very insightful discussion on the life of women and young girls growing up. It's like having a chat with a very, very clever and wise friend. Reading it will entertain and also make you a little bit smarter.
1451627297|5.0|This was more like King 's early work, and I particularly enjoyed it since I grew up during the time Kennedy was shot. Many of us were and still are haunted by a myriad of what if's, and this story takes those thoughts to a whole new level. The book's thickness seems almost daunting at first, but soon you're so engrossed you never want it to end.
B00CWVBTUU|5.0|Awesome modeling, animation, lighting and rendering. Its got serious qualities and some humor. Action packed and gonna keep you interested throughout the entire movie. Plus, they just look hilarious with their tiny little Lego legs running around.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Purchased this cable as a replacement for one furnished with a new sound bar. Excellent length to attach units in several locations. Built with thick but flexible  wire. Expect years of great service. Would recommend this cable for anyone needing a new or replacement cable at an exceptional price.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love how Suzanne Collins is so detailed when she writes her books. She makes it seem like your there with the character standing right with them! Amazing book. At the end of the book when I closed it all I could say was... wow, what a amazing book.
B006MPKD54|5.0|The second book in the series. It's just as good as the first one! I've really enjoyed reading Harry's adventures and can't wait for the next one
B005DJREJS|5.0|I stumbled across this show while looking for Prime eligible shows on my Kindle.  The writing on this show is smart and addicting.  I would not want my 13 year old to be watching this show and the fact that the characters are 15/16 and are doing such &#34;adult&#34; things is a little disturbing, but the show is so well written that I just can't stop watching it!
140006922X|5.0|More facts than most people would like to know about the early jews and who jesus really was. hard to put down once you get started
B000ID1J40|5.0|All is well. Product came through just as promised. My fella could not be happier with the surprise. Thank you, much!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I'm an ex-cop, a father, and a Christian. This movie speaks to all of what I am.<br /><br />It will also speak to anyone who has suffered loss, who is in a marriage, who has children, who simply wants to grow their values faith & hope.<br /><br />Packed full of drama, adventure, and comedy, this movie has everything for everyone.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Works great for my needs.<br />I have no had a single problem with it on my First generation Kindle Fire
B000002KHH|5.0|If you are trying to figure out which black sabbath album to buy, this is the one!!!! my 2nd favorite album of all time!!!! (my #1 is acdc-let there be rock)[[ASIN:B00008WT5C Let There Be Rock]] overall, amazing cd was not disappointed at all.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|Love Johnny Depp, didn't like this movie. Had potential to be a great comedy but never found itself which was disappointing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well I think u guys need to make the pocket edition better like the nether u only stay there for like two seconds and the other portals u can't make that sucksssssss  butt and I want to have wolves and bats and stuff so please do this u will make more money than ever before and happier customers
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This is the best adventure movie of all time! From Sloth to Chunk to the Truffel Shuffle, this movie instantly became a classic.  When you take tons of one-liners from a movie like this and use them in your everyday conversations as quips you know it will always be a part of your life.  These movies become a part of \\"you\\".
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's nice to be able to check the current weather any time I'm interested. Like the maps .I am able to check other locations too.
B008JFUNTG|5.0|This movie was excellent.  A great sequel to the original.  Fun for all ages. The entire theater was full and the audience was cheering.  Best movie of the year.
B001N4RORE|5.0|Really, a most unusual movie.  It is full of positive, happy people and dialog.  Songs from ABBA are adapted with english lyrics and provide an entertaining happy time.  Sort of a semi-comedy with music.  Julie Walters gets little recognition and she should be featured more in the promos.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent book. Very well written. Quick read, but we'll worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, after having a family member pass from cancer recently, I appreciated the perspective of this dark subject matter. It was beautiful.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|This is a real american opera and should be treated as such in promotions even though it stems from the French revolution.  A serious movie but entertaining.  Much food for thought.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best game ever ! Highly addicting and absolutely cannot stop playing. More addicting than candy crush!!<br /> 5 stars hands down, it gets hard after a while like any game but I love It!
B003M70O5O|5.0|The series overall is a must watch captivating audiences across the country in keeping with the real sense of the word...series. definitely 5 stars in my book.
B00ECUX7HC|4.0|Another fine collection of music from the matrimonial stew brewed by Tedeschi & Trucks.  The songs are likable and the ensemble is inspired and lively as usual.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Don't buy freezes and I have an anti virus and it went off as soon as I downloaded it don't buy not worth it
0920668372|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites and I find as the caretaker of an elder parent I cannot  get through it without a tear or two.
1935251740|5.0|Splendid book. The authors deserve the best credits for making this masterpiece project. The book provides you with clear picture of interference between quantum physics and consciousness. Great job!
B00EAZTONU|1.0|I have recently received an email from Amazon customer service and can officially confirm that the region code is 1 for the discs here, so only U.S and Canadian players can use the discs.<br /><br />If you arent in the US, you will NOT be able to play this film on your player!
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Cat and Bones are definitely one of my favorite book couples. After leaving Bones in the first book, Cat established herself as a kick-ass agent for the paranormal secret service agency with a team to boast. However, she continued to pine for Bones and her feelings for him were unfaltering. I love the scenes where they initially hung out together again. Bones was determined to get back with Cat and he complemented well to her neurosis. Cat's mom behavior to Bones continued to elicit laughs.
B00CTNUMPO|1.0|These &#34;Digital Copy&#34; releases are not Digital Copy and don't include iTunes copies. Amazon and Disney should adjust their product discriptions.<br /><br />I've already stopped purchasing WB discs due to lies like this.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|Like the way it continued the story.  It was not hurry up and wait for the next one. Enjoyed the strong women portrayed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so much fun. I play a couple times a day. I also got my husband and daughter addicted to it. My only issue is I wish stuff in dino world was not so expensive.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Separating 'Jesus of Nazareth' from the 'Jesus the Messiah' is an interesting and informative undertaking. The effort on the part of the author to address himself to the 'historical' man results in a useful and provocative product. I as a reader especially benefited from the writer's sorting and arranging of various biblical characters and events into a more or less narrative timeline.
B005544V6A|5.0|I started watching this years series on USA. Had missed the references so I' m now catching up on Amazon!
B00640UICA|5.0|It is fun to play the game and this is a fairly interesting game with very nice visuals and sound effects.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My phone came with one, but I really did not like it. It did not have enough functions and was a little funky to use? This one is supper easy, and has more functions.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I purchased this for fathers day for my fiance' and he adored it. he wears it whenever we have date night. He receives lots of compliments
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy this Bible app very much. I like the fact that it gives me a reading plan if I want, and a daily Verse. I read it pretty much every day.
0553381709|5.0|What can I say? George RR Martin has been compared to Tolken, however he's not as complex and you can read and re-read his novels over and again and still find new things that are fantastic. I'm eagerly awaiting the next new one, and am a fan of the HBO series as well. GREAT BOOK.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Had this installed before on another phone. I love it! Very easy to use and change! Adding new alarms is supper easy, and it will wake you up nice and easy. It works it's way from soft to loud, which I really like!.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Though rather predictable, this movie was done well. The actors did a good job and though I haven't read the book, the end plot twist did not come as a surprise to me. I won't say anything about it in case there are some who haven't read the book or seen the movie. Both main actors are talented and I hope Julianne Hough continues in her career and gets some great roles.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I just downloaded this. I have been having trouble sleeping at night. I love this App!! I now listen to it every night while laying in bed. In fact I love it so much, I had to order better sleep earphones!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Hearing her sing brings joy to my life. The duet with Donny Osmond was very sweet. I can't wait for her new album.
B000QZTNQ6|5.0|...when I heard this band for the first time. The guitar player is every bit as technically competent as Yngwie Malmsteen but has an even better sense of fitting his solo's to the song. Utterly amazing musicianship is on display here; even better, the songs are excellently composed and performed. Wintersun has created an epic and melodic masterpiece. I hope they make more albums; I'll be buying them for sure!
B00785P2QC|2.0|So, I do think the game is fun, but I do agree with other reviewers that you do have to spend at least some money, especailly in the beginning to advance the game.  Lots of money if you're impatient.  I only spent about $12.00 and after that, I was able to progress naturally with the game, but you do have to wait for coins and such to build up which can take a while.<br />Unfortunately, my game crashed after only about 4 days of having purchased it.  A fire errupted in one of my houses, the helecopter rushed to put it out, but never left!  It just kept swirling around the house long after the fire was doused.  I tried moving/deleting the house, but that didn't work.  I could uninstall and reinstall as it states to do in the FAQ's on their website, but if I do that I lose all the progress and the money I've already spent on the game. Not fair in my book!!  Even though it's only like $12 bucks!  Principle!! Another FAQ suggested rebooting my device.  Which I did, but now the game wont load at all.<br />I submitted a request to support and although they said they'd get back to me whithin 8 hours, I still haven't heard from anyone and I submitted the request 3 days ago.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's fun, while it works, but purchase at your own risk.<br /><br />UPDATE:  10/2013  I finally heard back from their support deparment, but it was over a month after my initial inquiry.  And after all that they were't able to help me anyway.  They asked me to send them a screenshot of the issue, but when I explained that my game wont even load so I can't get a screen shot, they said, well without that they don't know what the problem is and suggested again that I uninstall and re-install the game.  No mention of course of refunding me the $12 I had already spent on coins, etc.  Besides, I had already reinstalled the game at that point.  After about two weeks of not hearing back from them (and after following up, on my part with still no word from them) I decided to just lose my $12 and uninstall/reinstall the game.  I should have just uninstalled and left it at that, just based on principle! I did play it for a couple more weeks after that.  It's run it's course, I'm bored with it now and haven't played it in a over a month.  Will probably uninstall it and install something else eventually, and when I do, it wont be a game from G5 Entertainment.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Or at least it's close to the best show ever.  This season is really fun and the chemistry between all the characters is really engaging. Love, love, love this show.
B008602KQI|5.0|There is a reason that the film was so popular.  Although some of details were different than book, it was a good adaptation.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I really liked His Dark Materials. It  had a lot of action. If you just like those boring classic books, this book is not for you.
B00459EZLW|5.0|This show is an awesome mix between Star Trek and Stargate.  No big themes, just great entertainment episode after episode. Be warned: The last few episodes are horrible (maybe that is why it was cancelled).  I would love to see a movie, please.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was well written and showed what a horrible time Jaycee had to endure. I found it interesting to read of her relationship with her stepfather, who is the only person to see her get abducted and became a suspect himself.  I always had simpathy for him until reading this book.  He just was not a nice guy to Jaycee.  It may be why she ended up staying where she was for so long.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I really feel that Eric should have found a way to get out of the marriage contract.  He and Sookie should have ended up together, her probably as a vampire.
B00CCEHR80|3.0|This is a great show, some nice tunes, fine playing. It sounds like an audience recording though. I think Jerry should be more up front, and better sound. I love the songs and playing.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The characters of the Wool series are what keeps you reading.  Howey has created compelling, human people caught in a fragile world with little room for growth or free expression.  His use of language is at times fresh and memorable and at other times, merely drags you from scene to scene.  Still, he manages to have enough plot turns to guarantee page turns 'til the end of the story.<br /><br />My main quibble with Howey's work is his apparent lack of understanding of the basic science on which his story depends: radio and pressure suits.  This flaw caused my disbelief to fall out of suspension a number of times and only the strength of the characters could pull me back.<br /><br />All-in-all, a good summer read if your head is dizzy from the sun and your expectations aren't too high.
8186336141|5.0|I was hesitant at first about this book considering it looked very plain but the old saying rings true don't judge a book by it's cover. Though the visuals in this book are drawn the descriptions of how to achieve the different poses is very detailed. Would definitely recommend this book especially if you are looking into becoming an instructor.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|We enjoyed this movie.  It is suited mainly for younger children, so adults without kids may find it too simple.
B005COO1X6|3.0|A short story that is a classic King but a little more cut to cheese (because it is a short one). It go in to business much more quickly then his books what it is good, not some much descriptions but also it is nothing different that you probably read before at some King's novel or short stories.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I saw JJ some years back in Tulsa where his career started and it was one of the best concerts I've ever attended.  He's a great player and performer.  This CD is enjoyable because the side musicians are all great and the production value is as good as it gets.  If you can get some of his live stuff (bootleg) where he has more room to improvise you'll not be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun and challenging game and wasn't to hard. I wish there were more levels. It did not take very long to finish all 10.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|It is not as good novels written solely by Tom Clancy but it is one of the better co-authored ones.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good game once I got the hang of it. Hard but not difficult. Can't wait for the other levels
B00C061I3K|5.0|This is just simply some awesome music, enjoy!  If you like Daft Punk, you will like this CD very much!
B0049P1N3K|5.0|The detail and depth of this book is empowering,,,My life contiunes to get better as I read and realize the power I have to control EVERYTHING in my life...Thank you Rhonda Byrne.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The Movie was great from the start. Hulk and iron man did awesome, can wait for the next one. You wont be disappointed.  At must see if you're into marvel.
B005LAIHE0|1.0|We watched about a half hour before turning it off. Unlikable characters, bad acting, predictable plot, uninspired dialogue. Skip it.
B0015HOFZI|1.0|First off.  Completely my fault because I waited so long to hook it up (no room).<br /><br />It appears it was shipped without a belt.  Contacted Sony for a replacement and they said they couldnt provide one and I would have to buy one from an electronics store.  Cost $15.00.  FAIL on Sony's part...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|So far I have enjoyed the game.  It has been challenging and entertaining but I don't like being forced to review to keep playing.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I really enjoyed this season. Donna was a great companion. I really hated seeing her go. I guess it was better than having her die however.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Probably the most addicting game to me.  This is the only game that I have given into the temptation to purchase more cards so I could play longer in a single day.  So if you are a gambler and easily addicted, I'd say stay away from this one, but if you can control your purse, it's great fun.  Holds your attention more than some other games because the numbers are called fast and you can't pause in the middle of a game.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I came upon watching this by accident, so glad I did. Have been totally hooked since the first episode and enjoy watching it while working out on my treadmill. So much of &#34;regular tv&#34; is reality shows, with over indulged celebs, kids we need to be worrying about, or just plain weird, that we have lost some of the joys associated with great writing that took place on TV shows in the past. This show has top notch writing, story lines that are believable, directing, sets, and great actors/actresses that you can really take a few minutes and let yourself get immersed in the drama. The lead actress reminds me of myself and so many girls that where just trying to find their place in H.S. society. I am currently watching season 2 and have enjoyed the storyline progression.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Everyone should play at least Angry Birds game to pass the time, and improve skill.  It does get frustrating as it becomes more and more difficult.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game was really slow at first but with the new upload it works a lot smoother and really is fun.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I've never tired of Sudoku and have played for about 8 years.  This game gives a sense of achievement and the researchers say it is excellent to keep the dementia away from our brains.
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm has covered every aspect of how its the external factors that also play a major contributing role towards the growth and success of successful individuals.This probaly should clear the misconception many people have that successful people do not have to work hard and do not have to face difficult situations in their lives.The end was very well summarised and almost brings a tear.Especially when you realise the hardships,sacrifices and pain that successful people have gone through or have to go through in order to become successful.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game for killing time. Nice graphics on my kindle HD and I am glad that you get your extra lives not like candy crush.
0099519852|4.0|The book is a good read for all aspiring people who have aspirations to excel and reach the pinnacle of their desired field.A lot information is provided on myelination which I am not sure but probably could have been dealt with in lesser detail.Overall it is a very interesting read!!!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I enjoy the game just don't like scene freezing and on free room u loose a free game it isn't like when u play other rooms u get you credits back
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|love the game . good combination of physical skill and puzzle soling . can get irritating, but that's good.hope they make a core dive 2.
159448385X|5.0|I loved this book sooooo much! Definitely buy this book if you are going to read it, because it's a book I'd read again. The condition wasn't great, but what do you expect when you purchase it used. It also got here a lot quicker than expected.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I suffer from occasional insomnia and have found this app to be extremely helpful in getting to sleep. I enjoy it so that I am thinking seriously of upgrading. I definitely recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app! I have 5 horses of my own and the horses on this games act like my horse! Really fun!
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|My girlfriend introduced me to 'StarDust' and I fell in love with it! A great cast with good performances by Michelle Phieffer, Claire Danes and Robert De Niro. There's a scene with De Niro in which you would never expect him to do. Highly recommend it.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Great movie.  My kids loved it and this is years later.  I did have to explain some of the language that wasn't appropriate for them to repeat.  Since it was a great story and a great cast I had to let them see it.  Loved the pirate story and the treasure hunt.  Every kid loves a pirate story.
B000WN60NG|4.0|This is a 'roadtrip' movie with a heavy dose of the Devil thrown in for extra measure ... Question: Is Rock and Roll the Devil's  music? Can the Devil be beaten in a wager? Find out while you enjoy the ride...!!!
B000FCKBCU|4.0|Loved this book.  It was very light and I even found myself laughing out loud.  The story is centered around a young stressed out lawyer who finds herself in the domestic world not knowing how to make anything but toast.  Very funny.
1476727910|4.0|I don't read many books, besides textbooks and health magazines, so I thought this book sounded interesting.  The book was hard to put down, and it was very enjoyable.  I doubt the storyline was fantastic enough to make a movie on, but it was a fun read.
0399159347|5.0|I was so excited when I heard this book was coming out because What Alice Forgot is one of my all-time favorite books.  This book ranks at the top of my all-time favorite list as well; it just took a while to get there.<br /><br />This book does have a few issues that might turn a reader off.  The first 75 pages are rather slow and there seems to be a lot of characters to keep track of.  Also I figured out the secret very quickly and wondered if it was worth it to keep reading the book.  I am so glad I decided to keep with it!<br /><br />The characters' stories become so cohesive and interwoven as the book progresses.  At first I couldn't figure out what the Tess character was all about but by the end of the book you find that she, and all of the other characters, are intricately necessary to the plot.<br /><br />I always find it hard to write a good review without adding in spoilers, so I will just leave you with this:  If you can stick it out until the end, you will not be sorry.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a very interesting and step by step way to introduce law of attraction to any non believer.<br /><br />I really like Pam's humorous style; she comes across as a very honest and humble person.<br /><br />I loved reading this book. I might read this again sometime in future.
0061122416|1.0|Bought this for my sister for school and she hasn't even read a page &#62;.&#62;<br />Why can't school pick books that are actually good
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got it for my son but now I am addicted.  The minions are the best part of the movie so it is fun to play with them.
B00136RZUI|5.0|Gilmour has become very comfortable in his playing style. This comfort allows him to explore other musical genre's and they come out every bit as good, if not better than Pink Floyd.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Great movie! Lots of awesome action. Brought back memories of playing Final Fantasy VII as kid xD Great Blu-ray quality movie :)
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|Summary - great option for listening to music underwater.  Sound quality: 8, Ease of use: 7, Durability / quality: 9  Battery life: 7<br /><br />Swimming laps is pretty darn boring.  Having music is great.  I don't like wearing earplugs even though I get water in my ears - too often you want to talk to the person you are sharing the lane with or you want to be able to hear the lifeguard, etc.  As a result, I found these easier to deal with than earphone options - I simply put on my goggles and I'm good to go.  The player controls sit on your goggle straps.  The left earpiece has a play/pause button.  I wish they had a separate volume control - the volume and skip track controls are the same buttons, but it was a pretty short learning curve to get them to work properly.<br /><br />These have decent sound volume but it turns out you get a lot of splashing noise when you swim, so you're going to have these cranked up to 80-90% volume when swimming laps.  Controls are fairly simple, but it seems that several times I was restarting a song rather than skipping - will update if I decide it was a bug and not operator error.<br /><br />Minor nitpick - These claim \\"Bone Conduction\\" but I think that's just marketing hype.  These are basically small speakers that you have right next to your ears.  If you take them off your head and hold them an inch away, you can still hear the music.  From 6 feet away in a quiet pool you can still hear them - barely.
B005MJFA2W|4.0|Entirely new approach towards thinking process<br />System 1 and @ indeed exist and would be useful for everybody managing  self<br />The book is too lengthy but beyond that  stressed p[oint it becomes scaientific and very useful for people working in area of psychology<br />Indeed excellent book from noble Laurette
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|there isn't much to say other than what has been said.  This movie is the best Marvel movie.  It's a mash-up of a movie!!!
B0085TKAW6|3.0|Interestingly historically in true Follett fashion but I was disappointed, then irritated, at the amount of repetitive text explaining where people fitted into the story. The family trees at the front were enough reference. I felt the book had been written as a radio serial where people needed a prompt as to the characters' relationships with others.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Can you get any better than this.  Make sure to watch all the youtube videos too, unreal!  The whole album is nonstop great listening
B000YRY8BG|4.0|While having the potential of a great story, it seems as if they wanted to load this with as many well known actors as possible, which got confusing and didn't keep it moving, and crisp. However, if you keep with it and pay close attention to who is who you'll enjoy this because it has a great unsuspected twist right at the end.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Great album. So awesome, Track 1 is probably one of the better songs I have heard in a while from someone in the rap game.
B008JFUN6E|3.0|Sharlto Copley may be South African but that is the worst South African accent ever. Okay, so he is supposed to portray the stereotypical aggressive, self-righteous Afrikaner but I can't get my head around his over-the-top accent. Loved the Afrikaans folk song, though. The less said about Jodie Foster's mish-mash accent, the better.  Despite the distractions of those two accents, I did enjoy the movie. Special effects were great and as long as the viewer doesn't analyze the plot too deeply, it is actually quite entertaining.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Great songs done with great people and different arrangements. I keep on playing this album over and over and over
B0060CV498|5.0|Shows high school students who both have a love for music but there paths were chosen for them. They both want to follow there dreams and choose what path they will go down. The path may be hard and throughout the movie they keep trying to find the right one, this shows us though the path may be hard it's worth going down.there is such more I could say and so little to type. It's saying to follow your dreams don't give up no one said life is going to be easy you just have to fight to keep what you are fighting for. Follow your dreams who knows where they will lead
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Was just average and on the whole unbelievable. Story was a little weak. Acting ok. Too long to be so uninteresting.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. Highly addictive! Keeps you thinking and guessing. Great exercise for your brain. Would definitely recommend it. Well worth the little bit of money.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|The DVD hangs up over and over when he's running on the beach.  Not happy...I'd like a new one. Not doing 20 words.
B00EPC2ZOI|5.0|It is fabulous, the cast is amazing and the location is gorgeous.  but this aired on ITV this spring with 8 episodes, why do you only have 3 available?  I just went and rented the whole series at the ITV website instead.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|The watch came just has stated. It looks and runs great. Thinking about buying other designs to add to my collect. Very happy with my purchase.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I stay up night  playing this game; that's how fun it is. You can spend time making them pretty or ugly, whichever you want. The only thing I would change is the character choices. Maybe have more characters or let the player design their own character. Overall great app though, really fun!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've always wanted a temple run game it's free and I love it. It is minion based running game it is great you guys should get it because it is cute and fun
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|In my opinion, Spielberg's best film and one of the best I've ever seen in my life. In addition, the undoubtedly best performance played ever in a movie by a child. Fourteen year Christian Bale acting is just unbelievable, beyond all expectations. Besides, the rest of the cast, the photography and the music are totally stunning. A movie you cannot miss, believe me.
B001H1UQZU|5.0|This is one of the most profound and powerful movies that I've ever seen. It encompasses so many different elements of one's struggle with personal identity, and living with that identity in our cruel, non-affirming and judgmental society. &#34;Boy's Don't Cry&#34; is a milestone towards the affirmation, education, and liberation of Trans* individuals. I Love it! ❤
B008SOS63S|5.0|Saw this on public tv, Joe continues his live performances with style and outstanding guitar sounds. He makes it look easy and I like the fact he sings his own music while still being able to step aside for some of his blues heroes!<br /><br />ROCK ON Joe!
1402720602|5.0|very good book<br />especialy for beginning luthiers<br />perfect pictures for learning making molds<br />good detail in making parts for the guitar building

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Great story line to give an idea of several different walks of life in this country.<br />Intriguing, entertaining, informative and compelling.<br />Hard to put down, a must read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the characters! This is a great show.<br />Looking forward to seeing more in the next season. I hope it doesn't peter out!
B00E193Y36|5.0|More great music from a kick ass band. Get the live cd also, worth the extra coin if you have it.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|At some point in my life the definitions of introvert/extrovert must have changed!  No one would ever consider me an introvert; I have a very happy and outgoing personality, and can be quite social.<br /><br />However, I'm also quite the homebody ... never could handle an entire day of event after event.  Raising my children while working put an unbelievable strain on me and I always wondered what was *wrong*.  I always needed more down time and time for reflection.  So when I finished this book I gave a sigh of relief because I recognized myself ... and there is nothing wrong with me at all.<br /><br />Many thanks to my cousin Ellen for this recommendation.
B008Y73940|5.0|The movies was great. I really liked the story line and how things transpired. Matthew McConaughey is such a great actor. I woud definitely recommend watching this movies.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Five stereo-typical teens thrown together in Saturday high school detention with nothing-or everything-in common. The nerd. The jock. The socialite. The greaser/hood. The shy social misfit. A &#34;teen&#34; movie for everyone. Right up there with The Outsiders and St. Elmo's Fire.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Not only was the film excellent, but the product was in wonderful condition when it arrived.  The music was excellent.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an entertaining game when I'm stuck on unblock me x3 I like the graphic and the idea just not the elevator music
B00338QENI|5.0|Rebecca Elliot writes in a way that helped me to understand an important issue.  Learning about Henrietta and her family helped me grasp an important issue.  These are extraordinary times we live in, having information evolving faster than our comprehension of it's values.  The medical fields are, hopefully, pursued by people trying to improve our living conditions. I want to know more about keeping truth and integrity at the forefront of medical research.  Teach your children.  It's their future, to.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|Nor sure how many times my husband and I have watched this...will watch again and again and share with our friends.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Throughout the book you learn about the characters on a deep level.  You learn about their good traits and their terrible, twisted, plotting thoughts.  These thoughts give you insight into the characters' actions and provide motive for their behavior.  The plot gets twisted and emotional and provoking, and at this point in the book you can't put it down.  Then it ends.  And it's just like that.... it ends without a real ending or purpose.  It was an honest let-down after all the time you invest in reading and thinking about the details and scheming that occur in the book.  I plan on reading one of Flynn's other books because I enjoyed the unique style of \\"Gone Girl\\".  However, if it also ends badly it will be my last one.
6304806434|5.0|We have watched this movie 6 or more times...had it in VHS...wanted a more &#34;modern&#34; version.  Will watch it again and again and share it with our friends
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It took a while to build interest, but, as storyline developed we were drawn into each of the characters.<br />We loved the time period, morals, mores, and cultures & customs.... sorry when it was over.<br />Have already recommended to extended family members.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are wonderful in this...watched it many times..will watch again and again and share with our friends.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game... keeps you occupied. overall I would recommend this to friends and family. the level are somewhat difficult but with persistence it becomes easier.
B0019IB26I|5.0|This is a perfect blend of light, familiar pop, with some very soulful blues in a two disc set.  Mayer is far more talented and entertaining than I had known.
B004R0WKNE|5.0|Enjoyed the humor.  A little over the top at times with Harry's performance but still very funny.  Rachel is always wonderful.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This book moves very quickly, most likely because of the view point being that of a teenager with autism. I don't have a lot of experience with people with autism but the little that I do know seems to fit pretty closely with Christopher's personality. The book draws you in from the beginning and holds you the whole way as you watch Christopher on his journey. It's impossible not to feel compassion for him and the people around him. Very good book that I'd recommend to anyone.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This app for Mahjong(Kindle Tablet Edition) has some of the better graphics I have seen for a free app. Try it, I think you will like it. Keeps me busy playing so there is no boredom here.  Again give it a,chance .see fir yourself how clear the tiles are. I would not use another app for this game.
0062007297|3.0|I bought this as a present, full of great pictures. The receiver really loved it. Cool stories, cool photos, all that.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|when u want to read this book just make sure u have time lol. Its one of those books that once u start you don't want to put it down. I recommend it to any immigrants, very relatable. I could just picture right about every page. Kudos chimamanda, u surely delivered!
0307950689|5.0|The same exciting mysteries to examine and fast paced action by the fabulous Langdon as in The Da Vinci Code.<br />Macabre, intriguing and delightful in the telling.  I was motivated to look up the meaning of words and symbols and discover some facts that amazed me. How does Dan Brown continue to do stuff like this?<br />If you liked The Da Vinci Code, you'll love The Lost Symbol.

B005723JSQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I found myself laughing out loud a few times. A definite 5 star!!! Highly recommend.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I never really cared much for My Little Ponies when I was a kid, but this game got me interested. It's elementary, which is expectant of a child's game, but I still enjoy it.
1419705644|5.0|I love Adventure Time, at first I thought that this book was going to be bigger (didn't read the size at first time until it got home), anyway, this book is hilarious and I really reccomended to the Adventure Time fans, is a MUST HAVE.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love this series.  I save it to enjoy every episode without distraction.  So fun.  Clearly modeled on Los Alamos but better.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|This was not a bad movie, I guess.  Lots of special effects.  But I miss the Star Trek stories:  the journey to different places and cultures and the challenge to understand different kinds of beings.  Star Trek itself, in the fan books and novels, progressed to a Universe where multiculturalism was a core story and women were more than girlfriends and boy-toys in revealing outfits.<br /><br />It was a venue where we could question standard memes and imagine ways of solving problems other than wars.<br /><br />But if you like explosions you'll like this.  The actors are great, just working with plot holes and technical wtf's (the Enterprise under water???
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The characters are wonderful, I really liked how they all come together in season three. I have watched it three time, the whole series.<br />I do not watch television, but this series along with \\"lost\\"  is the best.
140006922X|4.0|I probably would not have read ZEALOT had it not been for Mr. Aslan's interview with Lauren Green of Fox News so I should thank her for her less than friendly meeting with the author since reading this  book was certainly well worth my time. (Since the book immediately after the interview shot up to number 1 on the NEW YORK TIMES best seller list, surely Mr. Aslan sent Green flowers.) First of all, had I not known that the author is Muslim, I would never have picked that fact up from reading the book. I detected no bias on the part of Mr. Aslan. Secondly, I do not believe he is saying anything different from what many other New Testament scholars and non-fundamentalist liberal clergy have been saying for a long time. What he does do beautifully is make his narrative that could have easily gotten bogged down with dates and long-ago forgotten facts about Roman emperors and Jewish high priests extremely accessible and compelling to the average reader. ZEALOT is quite simply often a page-turner. Mr. Aslan looks at the sparse historical information about Jesus, an illiterate Jew from Nazareth, rather than Jesus the Christ as portrayed in the Gospels and Book of Acts.<br /><br />ZEALOT consists of roughly 200 pages  of narrative  and 100 pages of notes plus a bibliography so much of what Mr. Aslan says would appear to  be well researched on his part. (Apparently he spent two decades researching and writing the book .) The book would have been better, however, if the author had included footnotes rather than notes on each chapter.  Just one example of many: Mr. Aslan (pp. 108-109) writes the following:  \\" Jesus's miraculous actions in the gospels, especially in the earliest gospel, Mark, do bear a striking resemblance to the actions of similar magicians and wonder workers of the time, which is why more than a few contemporary biblical scholars have openly labeled Jesus a magician.\\"  When I look to the notes on that chapter, \\"By the  Finger of God,\\" I see that Mr. Aslan mentions several scholars who have written on the subject, but footnotes would have  helped. If nothing else, they might have assured that the reader  who might not bother with voluminous notes at the end of the text  would read them.<br /><br />Finally the last chapter, \\"True God from True God,\\" which I read twice, is very moving. Mr. Aslan concludes his book this way: \\"Because the one thing my comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth--Jesus the man--is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ. He is, in short, someone worth believing in.\\"tions several scholars who have written on the subject, but footnotes would have  helped.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|I saw the film on an airplane and kind of wrote it off, but the book blew me away.  Elizabeth Gilbert has so much love and spiritual goodness to give in her story about meandering about the three I countries: India, Italy and Indonesia.  Her epiphany after a nasty divorce is filled with information we can all benefit from: e.g. maybe your balanced self is always watching over your messy self, rolling its eyes and chuckling when you think you're on the brink of doom.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Emotionally more realistic than the show. In a way, this book gives more credit to the real women who are incarcerated and illustrates that they are not scripted caricatures. GOOD READ.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Interesting concept and book. It did not take long to read and I enjoyed the book and the writers style.  I will definitely read others by this author.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|As this is the only app to mange your page on FB, you need to get it, but it does have some limiting features that you'll still need to swing by a computer to handle but overall helpful for the page owner on the go.

B0092S4WLY|5.0|When I started level one, I really found myself engrossed in the game, and of course I was hooked from the start.  Worked my way up to level 9, and Tonight I solved level. 9,  Yea.... I did it.  But my only problem was if I stopped playing on the level I was on before I solved the puzzle, there is no way to save the point where I stopped!  Which meant when I picked it up again, I had to start from the beginning of that level! Good thing I kept notes.  Can`t wait to get level 10!
B00170MYIS|2.0|Once receiving this battery we charged it with the battery charger that came with our Sony camera. We used the battery with our Sony camera, it registered full battery. Using the camera normally I noticed the battery drained quickly.  Do to the poor performance of this product I would not suggest this product for your Sony camera. I only use this battery to squeeze a bit more use out of our Sony camera. My experience with this product was not good. I wouldn't suggest this product.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|I think this movie is cute. But my daughter doesn't really like it. She thinks that the idea of the ponies turning into humans is pushing it. I think she doesn't \\"buy\\" what they're trying to sell. That's probably a good thing.<br /><br />She's a big MLP fan and has watched it twice and hasn't watched it since.<br /><br />Anyway, given the fact that they're reaching hard to bring in a wider audience, this is still a cute fantasy cartoon-movie.<br />\\"
B006YC74E8|5.0|I downloaded this to my kindle for free and it takes good pictures, the editing features are great and I love that i can sort albums, add pics from my computer and phone as well as social media sites.  I think the free version does more than enough.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|there are only five stars grading in this review process, I think this author easily deserves twenty.  When I read from other reviewers that this author was comparable to Tolkein, quite frankly, I was bitterly disgusted, how can anybody bandy the name of THE writer with such disrespect, by comparing him to lesser mortals!!........Then I started reading George R R Martin..errrmm..they were absolutely right, I think the two authors would very probably have made good friends.  The minds are obviously similar in lots of contexts, the sheer imagination, the ability to encompass such vast and everchanging plots and interweave them with such skill, to make the reader forget reality and live breathe hear smell taste and feel an imaginary cosmos populated with beings showing all the bravery, corruption, cowardice and egotism of a medieval society, add the condiments of fantasy and magic and you have a very special, enjoyable and unforgettable reading experience.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My kids constantly want to play this one, it functions best and gives you the best game choices when you are playing online, but it does still work when just on 'device' mode.  its cute and fun and keeps them entertained and it was free...no complaints really
B007N8RULO|5.0|I play this game quite a bit.  It is great when I am travelling because the time goes by quickly.  It also serves as a form of relaxation.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I got this for my kids for free and its a cute fun app but the free part is kinda short, there are WAY too many options to buy things and its actually a bit over their head skill wise.  They still find it fun but its not one they ever pick to play first!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had very little interest in reading a book about teenagers with cancer, especially while on vacation.  Too depressing I thought, I'm too old to read a book about teenagers I thought.  I thought wrong.  This book was excellent.  I laughed out loud so many times and was able to actually relate to the characters.  I truly loved this book and look forward to reading it again.  .
B000PE3BWU|5.0|Escape is arguable Journey's best album to date with its popular hits like Don't Stop Believin', Stone in Love, and Open Arms. Escape is one of the first albums to popularized the arena rock in the United States and the world. Escape also contains some of the highest pitches by Steve Perry.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|My daughter and I really like this game! We play it together and have such a good time. The graphics are good and you don't have to buy things!
B0052T7I18|5.0|Rocket to Russia is perhaps the best Ramones album next to its self-titled album. It shows slight maturity of the band's maturity in songwriting. A truly unforgettable album by a legendary punk rock band.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A great game to play.  a lot like subway surfers.  NICE GRAPHICS easy to learn how to play. a game for everyone
B009CZTDE8|5.0|The Imaginaerum Score is one of the best soundtrack albums I've ever in my life. It is writting in accordance to the band's release of the Imaginaerum movie. Tuomas Holopainen is credited for composing all the materials on the album. It demonstrates Tuomas' ability both as a composer and arranger of music.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|I am a big fan of the 90s era star trek shows. I don't dress up or do conventions but am still a big fan. Anyway this set, like the others, is top quality. The blu ray HD format is well done, the 7.1 surround provides an excellent listening experience, and of course its loaded with special features. If your a Star Trek TNG fan then you will not be disappointed.
B001FO7JTA|5.0|Black Ice has tested the patience of numerous AC/DC fans over the years. It is the first album since the release of Stiff Upper Lips, in a total span of eight years, the longest gap between any of AC/DC's studio recordings. It is by far not the most approachable and sensational album in AC/DC's catalog for new listeners. However, it is an album of conspicuous efforts been put out by the band to continue their influence in the music industry and entertainment.

B00008FD0L|5.0|Face Dances unleashes The Who's usual hard rock style and heavy guitar riffs and a dynamic vocal range produced by Pete Townsend and Roger Daltrey, respectively. The album has merely all the same sounds and styles that were featured in their earlier release. But it is still a respectable album considered an apparent effort being put into by its sound and lyrical texture.
B003OAHE3O|4.0|It's just a beautiful conceptual collage. Great for inspiration and centering yourself. Great purchase for sure.<br /><br />If you need to check out and put things in perspective, put this on with a good sound system.
B004YESKU0|5.0|SOAD box set is a valuable collector's item for any metal and particularly SOAD fans who are desired to collect all of their discography. Truly their best release of materials in so many years.
B009HNDTPO|5.0|This one of the best criminal minds shows of the season I really hated they had to kill off Erin... even if I did pay for it twice. ..
B002C39TUA|5.0|Strangeways isn't as approachable as the band's other albums. Most songs have cynical and pessimistic approaches to a circumstance evident from the songs' titles as Girlfriend in a Coma, Unhappy Birthday, Paint a Vulgar Picture, etc. This album showed evidence of the band relationship at an all-time low.
B00E1LAS42|5.0|The Great Gatsby is a great movie love the story and Baz is an amazing director!! Acting is great and the cars are even better.
B000O14VAU|5.0|Underworld is another one of those sci-fic movies that presents vampires and were-wolves. It is a great movie for anyone who's interested in that genre.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|This is an awesome movie and very inspiring.  Performances are above and beyond.<br />Highly recommend if you want to learn about endurance.
B000PFU6RW|5.0|Visions continues seeing the stable line up and musical approach of Stratovarius. The album contains songs like Black Diamond, Holy Light, and Visions as some of their most popular and musically-complex compositions ever written. Visions also identified Stratovarius more than just a common power metal band, but an innovative progenitor in the metal genre.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great characters, story.  Just really enjoyed every minute of this series and can't wait for more. Four three two one.
B004DTLK8A|5.0|Elysium maintains a similar style off of the Polaris album with guitarist Matias Kupianen. Songs are mostly fantasy-based with highly encouraging song like the Darkest Hours, which is the top ten popular songs in the Stratovarius' catalog.

B00915G6MG|5.0|It took a while for me to get into it, but thanks to USA Network, I caught up on all the seasons and all the adventures of NCIS.  Gibbs is so awesome, he's got me smacking people in the back of the head.  If you've never seen this show, buy them all and stay home from work for a week.  You'll thank me later.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, not too difficult, but still challenging.  I just wish there were more levels.  10 was just a tease.
B0081J9OWC|5.0|For my evolving music collection I have to either love what I buy or I dont buy it. Period. These guys are in my collection for good reason.

B0060V1WJ6|3.0|Really like the actors, found it to be mildly humorous, but not nearly as touching or comedic as hoped for.
B007428UN6|5.0|I didn't choose this movie on my own, and I probably wouldn't have.  That being said, I am so glad I watched it.  The photography in the movie blew me away.  It was so beautifully done.  I watched the whole movie without ever losing interest.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to like the first season but I did truly enjoy it. I really enjoy period pieces.
B00A285OOW|2.0|I didn't like the way it ended-there was much more to her life. Plus Henry's obsession with Richard was a little over the top.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I grew up playing metal gear. This collection brought back all the great memories and excitement that I enjoyed throughout the years. This series is one of the greatest and most iconic of all time a must buy for any video game player light or heavy.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I read Heat Wave in paper-back form last year and tried Naked Heat in electronic form on my new tablet.  The book's content held my interest from cover to the last page without repetition of style or pattern from the first book or from the TV series.  At times, I had trouble figuring out who was speaking a line but I suspect that was due to interruptions.  I liked Naked Heat and look forward to reading Heat Rises.<br />For those using a PC version of Kindle on a tablet (HP Envy X2), I like the larger print size (compared to paper backs), back lighting and landscape presentation of two pages very much.  It is easier to read than a paper-back book after a long day of staring at a computer monitor.<br />A fan of the Castle TV series
B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin is a band that can be enjoyed by any generation. No matter what your age, you will never be too old or too young to be a fan.

B00B22ASUM|4.0|It was interesting and fun to read a true life experience from some one about a cat.  Yes, I will recommend it to friends.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I rented this off Red Box late one night. After watching the first one, I knew it would be one that I wouldn't have to think about too much and I was right.  It was a perfect action movie when I just wanted to zone out a little while my insomnia worked itself out.  That said, I was disappointed that the majority of the actors in the first movie were either not there or eliminated from the second movie. Growing up with the comics, we all know Duke was the main figure and the source of our nostalgia or at least it was for me.  I like Duane Johnson in low plot action movies but he just didn't cut it when I was geared up to watch \\"Duke\\" in action.  I did like the ending scene where his character resolved his friends' death.  (Probably still a spoiler but I tried to keep it vague and you can figure out what's coming pretty early in the movie.) It wasn't a memorable movie by any means and I will probably forget what it's about or if I even watched it in a few years.  However, it did the job entertainment-wise so I give it 3 stars.  It wasn't great. I won't buy the Blue Ray or the DVD. I'll probably never watch it again; but it was worth watching once for the little I spent on the rental.

B005HSG3TC|1.0|Can I exchange it for one that will fit my HD?  If you will let me know how to do this.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I love these and have them both on the PS2, but I can't always be pulling out my PS2 in my small apartment. I love that they put both of these games on one disk. It runs so well, these games were really meant for the PS3 anyway since it pushed the PS2 harder than it could really handle. No slow downs, and even the controls feel better.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|Excellent and very detailed information. Anyone can start an aquaponics system using these guidelines. I would recommend this book to everyone.
0064471837|5.0|These stories are so immersive. The style of writing is clear and not tedious as some fantasy stories tend to be. The story moves along at a good pace and the characters are written authentically. The world Nix creates is gritty, dangerous, and beautiful with depth and texture and believable magic systems (they care consistent and make sense in the universe of the story). I highly recommend the Abhorsen books!
B00004W55E|5.0|I'd had this one before but it got damaged. I'm so glad to have it again. This is a good one to drive to.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|A very balance combination of interesting story telling and technical deep. Levy tells a fascinating story, by covering both the human and technical aspects of one of the company that has shaped our current way of life.
B000I9U7C4|5.0|This is still my favorite Martin Scorsese film. Now that New York has changed so much it's also a great document of that city at it's finest point of sleaze and crime. Robert de Niro is more frightening than most serial killers in horror movies today. A true classic in all aspects.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't always read books that keep me thinking about it days later.  But this book was amazing.  I had to write down who was who in the family and once I got it straight, it was captivating.  It will definitely leave you wondering what you would do if you were in the same situation.  I couldn't wait to see how it all turned out, but then again, I hated to see it all end when I was done reading the book.  It was excellent and I'd like to read more of her books.
0312330537|4.0|At epic novel of adventure and love, in that order. What distinguishes this particular tale is that it is apparently based on the author's experiences among the street people of Bombay and the Afghan mountain fighters. The life of Bombay's street people is often quite fascinating. Roberts has a real talent for writing: the poetry of his prose, the depth of the characters, the excitement of the plot.<br /><br />Roberts' experiences obviously affected him profoundly; recall how Dostoevsky's time in a Siberian prison camp became foundational for his identity and philosophy. But in a comparison to Dostoevsky, Roberts comes off rather the worse. Where Dostoevsky communicates with the story of the characters, Roberts often resorts to tendentious preaching or epigrams not directly connected to the plot. Like Dostoevsky, Roberts emphasizes freedom, but it's not integrated into a coherent world-view. The lack of decorum and dignity in the modern world is a severe limitation to Roberts' \\"realism,\\" such as it is. Shantaram tends to be melodramatic, sentimental, and sententious. That said, it is entertaining, memorable, and worth reading.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|All I can say is &#34;Wow&#34;.  This is politics at its dirtiest and at first I hated him so much (and yet you really love the actor) at first I almost turned it off.  It grabs you and won't let go.  I was watching until 1 AM and I never do that with the best of movies.  You are totally mesmerized from beginning to end and I can't believe I liked him much better than his wife.  Of course he goes too far but you still want to carry on and see what happens in the world of politics and the press.  Dog eat dog.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I really wanted this novel to show how beautiful Kaled can write...and it did.  But it was very hard to follow and I had to keep going back and forth to remember who was who and when it happened.  A strict chronology would have worked so much better than the confused sections that fail to easily flow.
B008YW5RH2|3.0|Sometimes the game does not load quickly. Sometimes you make a move, but the game doesn't register it fast enough. Good game other than that! It's kind of fun.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|We saw the Broadway play a number of years ago and love the music. So we were quite amazed at how well done the movie turned out to be.

B0087ITBPC|4.0|Guilt Trip started off well, hit a pretty bad spot, and then knocked it out of the ballpark at the end. There was just enough humor and just enough Barbara Streisand in good form to make this an enjoyable movie. Seth Rogen was consistently good throughout this whole film - he was a constant.<br /><br />Chemist son is trying to sell his miracle FDA approved cleaner. He isn't very good at it; in fact the opening sales pitch with K-Mart is so bad I felt sorry for the guy. Son decides to head home to see Mom and they ultimately end up on a trip driving from New York to San Francisco via Texas. There are cringe worthy moments, and then there are some very funny moments. The ending was everything in the world; it turned this movie into something special.<br /><br />Barbara Streisand was back to her old self, a great actress being a doting mother. I didn't much care for her in Meet the Fochers, her role was a little too far over the top. In The Guilt Trip she is just exactly enough mother that innocently talks about sex and other things that will embarrass her son. I believed her. Seth Rogen is simply perfect in this film. He isn't that goofy funny guy in most of his films; no he is much more like the husband in Take This Waltz, serious and incredibly well meaning. I wanted him to do well; I wanted him to win in this film. If you expect The 40  Year Old Virgin or Knocked Up, you will be very disappointed. I cared about what happened to both of these characters.<br /><br />This movie isn't as funny as I expected. It had some good jokes, but not the rip roaring laughing I expected. Instead it grew very slowly on me. I was surprised by how much I liked this film.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13. This is probably not for younger viewers. There is no nudity. But there is a scene in a strip club. The f-bomb gets thrown once very loudly and with a lot of emphasis by the lovely Barbara Streisand. There is a lot of other strong language. And there are a lot of conversations about sex and adult subjects.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film a lot. It was a good road trip film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0086213XW Take This Waltz]]ut sex and adult subjects.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film a lot.

B009RH9FR6|5.0|I have been using this case for a couple of months now and it functions very well.  I have used the &#34;stand&#34; setup many times as well as holding with one hand.  It performs as described.  The only thing- which I believe is a Kindle Fire feature and nothing to do with the case itself, is when closed, the battery still runs down on the Kindle.  I push the &#34;power&#34; button on the side to put to sleep, then close the case.  When I open the case, the Kindle wakes, but the battery has drained (not as fast as if it were fully on the whole time, but still drains).  The case is well padded, and the elastic band has held up very nicely.  I am very pleased and satisfied with this case.  I would definitely recommend and would buy again.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a story that keeps you very interested!  It is a great, yet twisted story idea that makes you think...
0307887448|3.0|Ernest Cline has an interesting story here, sandwiched between massive blocks of mainstream and obscure pop culture name dropping.  But it's bogged down by the fact that he overexplains every single reference that is made. It is my understanding that references are made for the \\"it-getters\\".<br /><br />Much like frogs, they die when you have to dissect them. But Cline goes beyond mere dissection. Like Frankenstein, he creates a monster from the remnants of dead 80s franchises. He's so anxious to not leave anything out that he manages to shove Back to the Future, Ghostbusters, Knightrider, and a few others into a single paragraph.<br /><br />He even jammed in an homage to Firefly, between John Hughes and Coin-Op arcade references.<br /><br />At first, the references are a unique feature. After a while, they are just a crutch upon which the rest of the story leans. And it's not a bad story, once you remove all the excessive commentary.<br /><br />Ostensibly, this book had an editor. Which probably means this book was twice as long before it went to print.<br /><br />He needs to write him or her a very long thank-you letter, mercifully straightforward, and devoid of yet another reference.
1607066017|5.0|Wow wow wow! What a gripping, imaginative, and exciting universe to get lost into. Great writing/dialogue, great art, and great plot. Volume 1 is a must read and will keep you wanting more.
B000HEWEJO|3.0|When I originally purchased this movie the description said I was getting a newly enhance version in color and one in black and white. When I received it i only had the B/W version. Overall, it's all I wanted. I didn't know there was a color version so I wasn't totally disappointed. But the seller should be more clear or true to his word.
0439023513|4.0|It was not packaged well. Some of the pages were bent. Which considering how the package arrived I am not surprised. It was all beat up and there was not much padding inside to keep them protected.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Started watching Battleship, drawn to it by its reputation as the biggest box office flop of the past five years, but I wound up admiring something about the movie and kept it up through the end, eventually luring my wife into watching the last two thirds with me.  We clapped at the end like two total geeks.  But I must say that in the light of day the movie has problems which prevent me from giving it the coveted Killian five stars.  I hate to say it, but Taylor Kitsch, so watchable in Friday Night Lights, has no personality with the short Naval Academy haircut they give him here.  Did his long twin swoops of side hair as Tim Riggins give him the shadow he needs to act?  Here, he's playing the same exact part--the handsome screwup who's throwing his life away, plagued by a difficult relationship with a distant older brother--and he's letting himself be a parody of Tim Riggins.  Even Riggins wouldn't have cut through the roof of that 7-11 to get the girl a chicken burrito.  And as others have said, how on earth did he get a berth in the Officers' training school or whatever it's called, with that track record, and how did he manage to turn himself around in what looks like six months of movie time, to become the greatest warrior the Navy's ever known?  OK, so that part is ludicrous, but I'm blaming it on the stylist who made Taylor Kitsch's face so glowy and blushy he doesn't even have any expressions.  Apparently Peter Berg, Kitsch's director in both this movie and on FNL, thinks he has it in him to be the new Channing Tatum, but I don't think so.  He needs new material--no, he needs the same old material, long hair, return to the Dillon Panthers, driving that truck, maybe taking over the coach's role at the high school when Coach moves to Nashville with Connie Britton on her new show.<br /><br />Another one dragged along into Battleship from Friday Night Lights is Jesse Plemons, and HE'S playing the same part he had too---the sleepy-eyed towhead sidekick who inexplicably wins the attentions of the hottest chick within miles--in this case, Rihanna of all people!  Plemons' stuttering and nervous tics bring to mind a degraded and country version of oldtime comic standby Jack Lemmon from those Billy Wilder films, but without the timing or the glibness.  He just stands around looking dumb and Rihanna gives her heart to him like he's Chris Brown.  Well, I didn't buy it!  However, Rihanna is terribly good in this show and in fact may be the best actor in it--outside of the Japanese guy and the man who has just little rods for legs, whom we figured was CGI at first but then we thought, OMG, that may be his actual body!  Either way he's pretty stoic.  Hamish Linklater, who plays the ambitious news producer on Newsroom who fabricates the Genoa scandal, here takes the old Jeff Goldblum role from Jurassic Park, except nerdier.  He's not bad either, though we couldn't figure out how he came up with the big reveal about the aliens' weakness.  Truth is, on the home screen perhaps Battleship loses a few points.  You couldn't see the aliens' awesome superweapon all that well--it looked like the whirling gizmo of gears that Pinhead employed in all the old 80s and 90s Clive Barker films--hovering ominously, then skeetering over surfaces and carving them up then briskly looking for a new target.<br /><br />I thought the good guys were going to harness the energy or instruction manual for those ball machines, and use them to carve up the protective fortress of plastic that the aliens had whipped up to isolate them in.  What happened to that plot development, eh?  Maybe they were saving that for Battleship 2: Balls in Our Court....  but due to the failure of Part One, it will never come to pass.licably wins the attentions of the hottest chick within miles--in this case, Rihanna of all people!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really like this alarm clock...works great and haven't overslept yet. It's nice to not have your heart trying to jump out of your chest when it goes off. Just have to remember to unplug the earphones from the jack when I'm done using them, otherwise it makes it difficult to hear the alarm later.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Living it like watching the movie.  Seeing all the characters coming to life. Highly recommend it to all my friends
B00942Y4IY|5.0|You see list for best sci-fi and this movie is often over looked, probably because the TV show was pretty bad. This was a favorite of mine in my teens and I recently watched it again to see if it holds up and it does. The story line is very unique. The acting is your typical, middle-of-the-road, James Spader namedly.
B006C1DH92|3.0|A fun time-waster. Played it for a couple of days then got bored with it. If you get it for free it is worth it. WOuldn't pay for it though.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's really a lot of fun but I do have to say it's kinda slow when the bubble are loading into the slingshot and also it does always recognize my finger when I go to shoot the bubble.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|But it was very good entertainment. I am not much of a movie watcher but this was worth the cost.

072325804X|5.0|This is a fantastic, unabridged collection of Beatrix Potter tales. I've been a fan of Ms. Potter's since I was introduced to Peter and Benjamin by my grandmother when I was a small child. Now my child, who is only 3 years old, already has most of the Tale of Peter Rabbit memorized, word for word! If you care about vocabulary, grammar, and literature, invest in this book. Reading classic stories to your young child is the best way to broaden their knowledge of language, something that seems to be disappearing from our public classrooms and the world at large. Although these are classics, they are lively, not too long, and contain Ms. Potter's original illustrations, so they are able to keep a young child's interest. My 3 year old LOVES this collection.

I finished the entire dvd but I wasn't a happy camper. Please Tom Cruise I love your work, but you're too old for this role---Sorry!!! Having said that --the special effects were gorgeous. I was mesmerized by the scenery--it helped take my mind off the &#34;silly&#34; story line. If you just want to mindlessly pass an afternoon--it's ok.  Otherwise, skip it.

B00000J2PH|4.0|I have really enjoyed reacquainting myself with this iconic album.  The songs are as interesting and fresh as ever.  It really brings back memories to hear that great voice of Carole King's again.  The sound quality wasn't quite what I was hoping for.  The sound is certainly very good, but it lacks the impact that I expected from a remastered album.  Were the original tapes used?  Lots of fun, but the piano doesn't sound as big as I remember.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I loved this DVD set, still love it (when I can confiscate it from my teenage sons) I originally watched this series on HBO, and when It hit DVD I knew it was a must have! Very Pleased, still watching it 3 years later.. ;-)
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Kinda forever war meets Starship Troopers. Good, fun, and well written. Good character development. Personal story strong voice. A good fast read, deserves its place on NPR's list of greatest scifi books.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Always enjoy a good sci-fi show and this one delvers. Glad they brought it back for more seasons. Very entertaining.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|great, great, great. I guess that's all I can say. Didn't think I would enjoy it but I'm glad I did and I'm totally into this series
B001JIDE3M|1.0|The 3d version has an option to purchase through amazon instant video yet the video I was able to watch is not 3d! This is very misleading, if you want to purchase this video through amazon instant video beware~! The video WILL NOT be 3d even though the option is given to purchase it through their 3d movie selection.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|everyone needs to watch this. I had no idea I would be into this. Really great writing and casting is spot on.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The book was fun to read, held my interest and was well written and I liked the character development.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B009ZE27US|2.0|This game is kinda fun. It does not get you age right. I think that they should make the age right. That would be so cool. They also have a weight app that is worst because it says that you weigh like 200 pounds and it is not fun at all. I can see why it is free,both of the apps.
B000RJO57I|5.0|This was a funny movie and I laughed til I had tears in my eyes.  Not a big fan of the genre, but Simon Pegg was so funny.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was a little slow at the beginning. I am 75% of the way through and it is now starting to get interesting.<br />I hope it finishes off good!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good fun as long as its free. Would like it to be easier to operate on the kindle. But overall fun.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|ti's alarm clock is so easy to use. it works very well. long I wish it had more tones to chose from to wake up to.! it is nice alarm.,
0763628182|1.0|While I know this is an old book and I knew I was buying a used version, I didn't expect the entire binding to be taped along with most of the pull/pop up pieces in the book. Very disappointing.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|if there were a second Rio, we would probably want to see it as well, they should do a sequel with the kids growing up!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Absolutely must be included in your music collection. Especially after seeing Sir Paul this past summer in concert, it just makes you appreciate the music even more.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Hi it's good<br /><br />You need to play<br /><br />I think it will be a good time to spend time doing nothing. Good time waisted.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Love this throw-back to the R&B of the 70's and 80's. Great dance music. Much like the tunes on Unorthodox Jukebox. Fun to listen to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a lot of fun. My whole family is addicted to this game!!! It's definitely worth downloading. Hours of enjoyment!!
B001DCN178|3.0|I don't know how to rate this product as I am an amateur.  This product came as advertised, however, it said software was supposed to be included.  I also did not get a manual, just a paper identifying the parts. There was one sheet of paper showing how to program buttons but I cannot figure this out at all, hence, amateur.  It also says download Tracktion from the product registration page. The page doesn't work.  It also says plug and play on Mac Book but again, I plugged it into my MBP which does nothing.  It does light up but even with headphones plugged in makes no sound at all. Do I have to have monitors hooked up? Can I use Garage Band with it.  I don't think my MBP recognizes the keyboard.  There are no instructions really.  It shows how to hook it up, but doesn't play or do anything. No software, no manual.  It's beautiful as it sits there doing nothing lol.  I am reading and looking for some help on this and will upgrade my review if I can figure it out.  Thanks for any help.  Perplexed.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Great game it dose make think and you need to have structural building knowledge. The good news is you have all the time you need to construct your bridge. Bad news is you are limited by your funds, meaning each level gives you a budget to keep. If you run out of money you'll need to erase some or all of it and start over.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not quite the equal of The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns, but a great novel nonetheless. Love conquers all (and we're all saps for that ending).
0767919408|5.0|I don't usually read history books, but I figured that Bill Bryson always has an interesting way of looking at things.  Having only read his travel books, I wasn't sure what to expect from a Bryson book where Bryson isn't the main character.  The humorous perspective is still there, and the topic is far more interesting than I would ever have thought.  Many other reviewers have recounted the remarkable number of still memorable historical events from that summer, but it's Bryson's narrative that gives it a freshness that makes 1927 seem more recent that it really is.  I still think that books like [[ASIN:0307279464 A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail]] and [[ASIN:0380713802 Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe]] are funnier, but this is still a great read.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's a good game... thought about getting because  I needed a good game for a four year old girl. This is , I think, too hard of a game for her but I enjoy it. Although, the videos to watch for extra gems doesn't work on Kindle fire so...Yeah.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Without Jim Kirk and his crew, we never would have gotten the follow-on shows or the movies.  In some ways, it's quite cheesy, but you can hand-wave that away because obvious budgeting constraints.  The stories were written by some of the best sci-fi minds of the day and it shows.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game providing hours of entertainment. Family friendly fun. Adorable little minions make this game even more enjoyable. I'd play every day if I could
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Best charger I have bought. I even bought extras to give to friends. Only goofy thing is the markings on the two USBs. One labeled Apple and one Labeled Android, implying that you shouldn't use them for what they aren't labeled for. I'm not sure that is the case. It would be better if there was another way of noting the difference.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|The mastery and freshness that exudes from this book mirrors the beauty painted within its pages. Martel's animation of human characters is as impressive as those of the unlikely animals that appear at every turn.  He creates an experience of the natural world that is undeniably human, but so intune and awe-filled that we're all encouraged to look at our domestic cat, dog, park or local beach with a newly profound appreciation.<br />His style of writing is addictive, and so effortless. It was a joy to read.<br />Saw the film too, which doesn't have the book's philosophical and religious dimensions, but is one of the most beautiful bits of cinematography I've ever had the fortune to witness.<br />Such a wonderfully magical story!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Only watched 3 episodes so far, I know something bad happens but it hasn't yet! I hope it is not someone I like!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun but it could be just a little tougher.  Still well worth the money for the full game though!  Nice spooky atmosphere.
B000HL2J0G|1.0|the speed of transmisssion and quality of the movie was very good. the show itself was too primitive, not worth watching
B003O86FMW|4.0|I say that this shows for people in real life that we are not pawns or simple toys people can play with or break we are people not simple toys.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book goes in to depth about how you can no longer count on a &#34;job&#34; to take care of you forever. Even though the concept has always been life draining it is not even financially secure anymore. I recommend this book to anyone.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|Good but it really asks for money and my micro transactions arent working . Every update destroys a game gameloft the make more bugs and glitchs than fixing
B000FC10HA|5.0|This book is very interesting and applicable to business. I was entertained and learned some new strategies for building a brand. Should be named brand building 101.
B007AL48UK|4.0|This is a good way to pass some time dreaming of better times on the beach! No reason not to have it.
B008Y5OWMK|1.0|I am 3/4s of the way through this awful film and am giving up on it.<br /><br />A worse than usual Hollywood reimagining of a historical event.  Heaven's Gate tells the story of the Johnson County War of 1892 in which the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) with a small army of hired guns invaded Johnson County with a list of 125 (closer to 70 IRL) names of known and suspected cattle rustlers to be killed.<br /><br />The main characters are<br /><br />James Averell<br />A Harvard graduate federal marshal who leads the resistance.  IRL a homesteader, barkeep and postal worker who was killed in 1889 probably just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time rather than doing something heroic.<br /><br />Ella Watson<br />A prostitute from Kansas with a thick French accent who IRL was also killed in 1889.<br /><br />Nathan Champion<br />An enforcer for the WSGA who IRL was a suspected rustler that was killed by the WSGA.<br /><br />I would go into detail of the events, but lack the time and would instead recommend reading about the real thing.  Not only would that be more accurate, but compared to watching a movie which is a tedious waste of time with terrible sound quality, more entertaining as well.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I am on day 22 and i can see a drastic change in my attitude, it has definitely helped me refocus.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits, Season #1, has Interesting characters and intriguing plot twists. Every show is both funny and sad.  The first show hooked me.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|It was like watching a violent video game designed for an adolescent male that eliminated all control from the viewer except for the power-off button.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Both Hopkins and Mirren performed brilliantly in a tightly written screen play. I am now going to have to revisit my favorite Hitchcock movies and envision him on the other side of the camera.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love the game., but absolutely hate the pop up ads all the time.  Really are they necessary every 2 minutes?  I won't buy from the advertisers.
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|Does not require a fast time, only need to get the three stars.  The only thing that did not work for me was selecting a level.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Excellent performers, great band, wonderful atmosphere, flawless bluray picture quality. Excellent value for money. A perfect way to spend an evening with friends and family.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The game is a little glichy he randomly appears breakdances a little very fastly and he disappears so i give this a 5
B00A285OOW|3.0|This is worthwhile reading but her previous books are more interesting.  The basic theme of this book is trust, and lack of trust, between Henry and his York queen and how that impacts their relationship.  Henry accepts the fact that he will never impress or inspire the love that Edward did.  Still, I kept wanting more, based on her other books.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I don't even give reviews because I never have time...or care to spend time writing a review...BUT this is a truly enjoyable book. Kept laughingly said out loud...how did this guy come up with this great stuff! The characters were fantastic and for once I couldn't figure out what was coming next...the only small negative was the author's propensity for long drawn out descriptions. I skimmed these...really the story line was too good to have to stagger through so much descriptive text..<br /><br />Note this book is great for young adult readers also
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very entertaining game, but also very addictive. Once you start playing a game, it's hard to stop..Recommend this one for sure
0375869026|5.0|Our grandchildren absolutely loved this book so much, several read it twice!  I am looking forward to reading it myself!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did not like this book. In the beginning I almost put it down because I could tell it was going to be a downer, but I did not know how much of one. I felt yucky at the end and would not recommend this book to anyone.
B00C32R64G|5.0|It is a cd you can listen to all the way through and enjoy. Something for everyone. The singer's voice is incredibly unique. Awesome guitar tracks, as well.
1451695195|5.0|I can't tell you the number of people that I have run into that have read this book and been enthralled by it. He takes information that's hard to visualize and does just that. He walks you through his experience and you feel as if you are either there, or as if you can clearly see it. A must read in my opinion.
B0048L4VRA|5.0|We bought this pool for our 4 month old. We use it on the dock at our lake house to shade him from the sun and keep him cool. Ironically he prefers to lay in it without any water in it. When there is water in it, we have to hold him. The pool is also the perfect size for us to sit him in it in his Bumbo to splash his feet in the water.<br /><br />It's a convenient size and relatively easy to blow up manually. We live in the city, so it's the perfect size to put on our back deck or in our little driveway.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Enjoyable, suspenseful, romantic. Great film, much better than I was anticipating... this is not a dumbed-down, empty romance story. Thank you!
B0002XMKYE|5.0|It keeps my husband happy. People who like true war stories.It was very interesting to watch. Husband loves it. Great.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|This movie has the same quality as the first three. But it still has enough difference to make it great.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|They are great movies. They keep the kids happy for hours. There is nothing I don't like about these movies.
B00CJGP116|5.0|Just another one of Marc's best work to add to my collection! Absolutely wonderful as he has always given his best to his fans.
B000MG1ZFQ|5.0|I lost my copy of this album years ago and had never gotten around to replacing it.  Wow, how did I ever survive...?
B008OOYALE|4.0|Great game...bit slow and costs way too much to remove some of the trees. But still cool.it is a lot of fun breeding dragons and seeing what you cocme up with.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|i have read many reviews of the performance of other phantoms e.g.ben lewis in love never dies and gerard butler in the film version and ramin karamloo in the above version. i think all were very good. just different personalities with their own interpretation. my overall favourite is ramin in this version.also i liked sierra bogess. i have also love never dies with ben lewis who is different but equally as interesting as the phantom. i would recomend both these 2 dvds to anyone interested in the full story of the phantom of the opera.
1607053551|5.0|Lots and lots of information for a novice.  Would also help a person looking to start their own line of fabric!  Explanations clear and easy to understand.  I enjoyed the profiles of the fabric designers, as well
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Starting to get a little bit cheesy and less dramatic - video quality is very good. Episodes are becoming too stereo type.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|A true classic a staple for anyone that enjoys a good musical. Worth picking up by anyone that loves film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing story. Finished it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. Just wonderful! Now, On to the next!
B00011D1OA|5.0|Singing in the Rain is the greatest movie musical-- but the greatest Broadway shows made into movies are these:<br />Guys and Dolls,  My Fair Lady, Sweeney Todd, Hairspray and there are perhaps 5 others we could quibble about whether they should be on the list.  Bottom line: of course you should see My Fair Lady-- nearly every song is a gem, and as Stanley Kaufman wrote when the movie first came out (at a budget of eight million dollars which was considered outrageous at the time): (to paraphrase) &#34;It is worth every penny because it preserves Rex Harrison's magnificent performance.&#34;  Agreed.
0618477942|5.0|A deep, complex, exciting, enchanting, troubling, transcendent story of the relationship between a young girl and her father.  Rich and moving and insightful. And a marvelous union of picture and story.
B009WUBERW|3.0|This romp on the wild side of a creatively drawn story brings you by a cast of action heroes we have all enjoyed, a little worse for wear but up to the task to entertain. An excessive amount of violence, guns blazing and cheesy action pandering but it's what you expect when you sign up for this ride.
B008Q0AJA2|4.0|A reality show realized and a warning of the depths we can take for the sake of our own amusement that we all hope we never venture into.
B008Y73940|4.0|Fiction made to mirror reality can get close to home, kinda scary. It has a great story seemingly steeped in truth but can exist anywhere.
B007N85POS|4.0|It is not an easy game but it is fun to play. Definitely worth the time for those who love Angry Birds.
0893860468|5.0|I was reading it, walking around with a stupid laughter on my face, it is me, it is about me, it is perfect
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I would highly recommend this book.  Read through it quickly and I have also enjoyed the other books in the series.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Just saw the movie for the first book. It was good as always the book is better.  This is another great addition to this series. So much happens in this book. I really loved it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved it. Just like the first book in the series I couldn't put it down. I would say this series is a MUST read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My friend recommended this show and I'm hooked. It's fast paced, smartly written, and so good! Check it out you won't regret it.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This is by far the best dystopian series I've read. Unpredictable plot, enthralling characters, anxiety inducing to the extreme. It plays on all of your terrors, both apocalyptic and subconscious. You won't regret reading this series. Just start at book 1.
1250012570|5.0|It was nice to read a love story that didn't contain vampires or people living somewhere other than planet earth.  I'm not throwing shade at those types of stories but there was just something comforting about this story taking place in the 80's and the central theme was just boy meets girl and they, eventually, fall in love.<br />I was taken in by the first page.  The author, Rainbow Rowell, grabbed me and didn't let me go.  From the first page, I felt for Park and wondered what in the world happened with this Eleanor person.  Eleanor gone.  I needed to know where she had gone and why.<br /><br />I liked Park better than Eleanor.  She is a bit quirky.  But I liked that he liked her quirkiness.  I hated Eleanor's life.  It wasn't her fault, but I hated her mother for allowing her life to be that way.  I hated her stepfather.  I enjoyed Park's parents, even though his father wasn't always ideal.  To give an explanation for my hating, would I feel, give away much of this novel.  You need to make the discoveries for yourself.  The cover on this book is so simple and so cool.  There is a lot of foul language in this story.  This surprised me for some reason.  There were moments that I forgot that I was reading a young adult novel.  The author's writing is superb.  I look forward to her next book, which I have already ordered.  I'm glad that I gave this book a shot it was better than television, which isn't saying much, but meant in a very complimentary way.
B005PK1G76|4.0|I needed something quick and easy for my i'coo stroller.  It can hold wide bottles like the fat Dr. Browns as well as drinks for adults.  The zipper netting pocket is a cool idea for keeping id's and cards or a cell phone privately.  However I wish the middle compartment where you can store whatever, had a closure so you items placed in there won't get wet or people see what you have and while you're tending to baby, its easy for someone to steal and go.  (Sorry I'm from the &#34;concrete jungle aka New York City we think about things like that constantly lol).<br />Otherwise great idea for the high end strollers that doesn't have a cup holder, tray, or storage, etc.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Awesome story!  I found it very inspiring.  It was not the typical success story I have read so many times before.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not best book in series but a must read. Take the team to read the series and you will be happy
B008YW5RH2|4.0|But...to get the entire game it looks to be about $7. There doesn't seem to be any way to get the upgrades or full tournaments without shelling out the cash. Otherwise great fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game!  It kept me thinking and it got harder each level. No gaming issues at all. Bring on the next 10!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I can't wait until the next book in the serious is out. This story is very 'twilight zone-like' and right up my alley.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best show ever!! We are both addicted and awaiting Seasion 4.  Just unhappy about how season 3 had to end.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I have had this case for months now, and it is just as great as it was when I first purchased it.  The color is great, and hasn't faded at all.  The elastic band has not worn out or loosened AT ALL since it was purchased.<br /><br />I was expecting to have to replace the elastic band with a hairtie (yes, a hairtie) after the first month, but it is just as springy as the day it arrived.<br /><br />Nowhere on this case has it begun to wear, fade, tear, or loosen at all.  It's the perfect case for your Kindle.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Would not connect to Facebook, and wouldn't let me play as a guest. Horrible on Kindle.  BOOO boo boo boo.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My daughter had this already on her ipod & really likes it there.  Got it on kindle so she could play with that, too.  She says it is easier to manipulate on her ipod.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I love ellen- it was funny at parts but didn't make me want to keep reading at all- took me a while to finish
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I liked it more than I expected I would. It has a great storyline to it. It was a little slow at first, but it came around.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it. It entertains me while.I'm bored and it entertains my friends too. It's amazing. Everybody will love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy reading and entertaining.it's just like the movie and looking forward to reading the next book and watching the new movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I installed one of these on our wall mounted LCD TV in the office. People in my office use Macs, Windows and even Linux. We were really surprised how everyone could cast their browser to the TV without having to buy any special hardware. And how simple it was regardless of what OS they were using.  Of course you have to have the Chrome browser installed.<br /><br />And the low price was the best part.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Seems to be getting a lot of negative reviews at the moment and i can't fathom why.  I enjoyed it thoroughly even though i  half knew what the story was about by the media hype and it still kept me turning pages.  Main characters are complex and seemed destined to collide with each other in steamy and passionate love scenes.  Support characters were also well written and fit well into the story line.  I hope you enjoy it as much as i did.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to setup and Netflix works great. I love being able to quickly select a tv show to watch on my iPad and hitting play rather than having to traverse menus with a remote like you do with Apple TV or any other device.
B006QF7664|1.0|Made it 30 minutes, then killed it before it killed me. Dear Lord, I wish I could have those 30 minutes back of my life.<br />Without question, the worst movie (or, 30 minutes thereof) I've seen in the past 3 years.
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|When this film hit the theaters, reviewers were almost universally lukewarm.  I initially watched it because I had friends who were involved in the making.  I didn't expect much. But I was surprised to find that it's not a bad movie at all.  The acting is quite good.  The sound is excellent.  The China Girl is one of the most appealing synthesized characters I've ever run across--really quite novel.  I enjoyed the saturated artificial look of Oz and overall I found it quite an acceptable prequel to the classic from the 1930s.  Kids might snuggle a little closer to the parents in the scarier scenes, but I found it enjoyable fare for grownups as well.
B00C5XBAOA|3.0|Despite the fact that Amber, Sophia, and Queen Miranda's heads popped off within minutes of removing from packaging, my daughters still play with this every day. Disappointing that the quality is so bad, bc the toys are not cheap.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I know you're not going to buy a Star Trek movie on my recommendation.  Chances are that your mind is already made up.  But I'm glad to say that JJ Abrams kept the part that matters--the personal interplay between characters--and was confident enough to ditch a Star Trek history that had become cumbersome.  The actors are all well cast, none more so than Karl Urban (Bones) who has a wonderful take on the grumpy character of the doctor.  This is disposable entertainment to be sure, but it's fun to watch.  It's a worthy part of 'the canon'.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I admit it....Love Chicflix! And am completely in love with this show. Hated Big, Chris Noth, on Sex in the City and think Peter, or should we call him Dick plays an even more hated character on The Good Wife. Never....never....never buy media but instantly bought season 4. Have watched the series 3 times and, looks down at shoes and grins embarrassingly, am planning on watching again before the Sept. 29 season premiere. Sick....right?
B00640UICA|5.0|I just fell in love with these cute lil creatures! I thought it would be an easy little time-killer but I was really surprised how challenging it is!<br />I'll be happy to pass this on to my 5 yr old daughter but I'm not ready to have her take this game over yet!
0064471837|4.0|Much like the Book of the Dead from the series itself, I can re-read this book and the two after it over and over and am, every time, surprised to find something I missed before or feel something about the events and characters that I hadn't on the last read through.<br /><br />Sabriel is one of my favorite heroines and has been one for a long time due to her steady but not cold attitude and her matter of fact tone throughout the book. Nix does a great job of keeping you guessing about the characters without holding you in a state of constant trepidation--the characters' histories and loyalties and magical tendencies are all bound up together to create deep, tangible motivations, all without relying on the characters to gas on about themselves.<br /><br />The Charter is also one of my absolute favorite magical systems in fantasy. It is structured but mysterious, much like a science in its own right, and although the magical events progress in a mostly logical fashion, it's clear that its history and scope are beyond classification in a very spiritual way.<br /><br />Great story overall. :)
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I have been having several issues with the kindle version which was also reported by several other users. Gameloft said they'd fix the glitches and bugs on next update.  I suppose they did in a way. Now the app won't download correctly,  only getting to about 81mb then crashing. I was finally level 70 and had spent a gift card on gems for some of the quests. Well now when I finally got passed that opening screen,  I noticed it had started me over again completely. If you use a kindle I suggest not spending any sort of real money, as this app is pretty unstable.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it.  This is just plain a Great Spielberg movie
B008220C38|3.0|I Did read Anna Karenina many years ago and loved it. I felt this movie version a bit less<br />&#34;deep&#34; in both text and acting.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is brilliantly written.  I switched between laughing and crying through the entire book. At one point I didn't want to continue on because I had fallen in love with the characters and wanted this moment to just freeze in time. But, alas, I  had to finish the journey with them and I'm glad I did.  I recommend this book 100%, just keep those tissues close.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|cant wait for more levels..this game really makes you think. .I didn't find anything so challenging that I wanted to give up.  love it
B004UID2LC|2.0|after using for a while it became a virus and would'nt work then none of my apps would work...thanks alot
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun. Better than ICBM!!!! Of late 80s early 90s. Saw this had to have it, since it was free today .i was all over it. This game rocks. Hours of fun will be had.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|The plot is so thin and predictable it's practically transparent.  Anyone involved in the final product that is this film should be ashamed.
B004P7CMDM|5.0|my family loves all the crow movies.thay keep you thinking what is going to happen next.so I would stay buy them
B00A8ECU24|4.0|After the last update it says &quot;string not found&quot; where the gameloft symbol used to be and then it crashes at the loading screen. please fix it!!! before that I loved it!!! it takes a while to get gems so ONLY use them to buy buildings/ponies etc. other than those problems I love the game!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Reacher doesn't disappoint as usual.  11 books since March and still going strong. Wonder what's in store next. Find out tomorrow
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is back and better than ever. This movie is action packed from start to finish. This movie has raised the bar thanks to the acquisition of Marvel by Disney. If only they could have made Ghost Rider :-) That was the biggest embarrassment of a Marvel movie next to Dare Devil.<br /><br />If you are a Marvel comics fans, or if you just love great action movies then you will love this one. Both the acting and the special effects are top-notch.
0060507772|5.0|As someone who has read all the Discworld novels up to, and past this work, I say The Last Hero is a masterpiece. This milestone entry includes not only another brilliant Pratchett read, but also amazing and unique art that really brings life into an already very lively series.
B00B3T6FIS|3.0|Do not expect any incredible acting or riveting drama. Even so, this is a cute movie that will always be a classic to me.<br /><br />&#34;I am feeling very Olympian today!&#34;
0060012358|5.0|As an avid Discworld fan, I didn't know what to expect from the first entry written for young adult readers. This book almost flew under my radar. But after having found out about it (thank you Wikipedia), I read it and all doubt went away - This is, in every sense, a true Discworld work. Every bit as good as any other entry in the series. Despite being written for young adults, this award winning novel is not watered down at all. Pratchett continues to amaze.
B005544V6A|5.0|The characters are great.  I enjoy the story line and how the two lawyers communicate with each other.<br />There is minimal violence but you are kept on the edge of your chair wondering how they will solve the next problem.<br />Fun program to watch.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game overall. Slightly repetitive but certainly fun. Got it for free so I am not sure it is worth the dollar.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I seriously loved this book. I can't stop talking about it and I find myself referring to events and interviews as if they were real.<br /><br />First thing you need to know. This book is a collection of &#34;interviews&#34; with people who survived. Each interview is very short. Therefore there is little to no character development. No main character. No real conclusion.<br /><br />Second. It isn't really about zombies. Of course the book revolves around a zombie war but the things I found fascinating were the politics, sociology, psychology, military blunders and successes etc. The living dead played a very minor role. It could have just as easily been written about a different (more believable?) catastrophe. Well except for the fact that the unique nature of this threat caught us totally unprepared. I would not hesitate to recommend this to sci-fi haters.<br /><br />There are a few &#34;interviews&#34; where the interviewee has some rough language. I would love to read and discuss this book with my family but I would edit those out for my kids.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - but only read it if you are good with the choppy nature of the book and if you aren't looking for a zombie horror read.
159562015X|4.0|This little book is an amazing resource for me as a Leadership Coach. It is a great tool to help people and teams learn more about how they are wired and when and where they do their best work. If you are reading and using this book without some guidance and help, more research and reading should be done as the book is light on how to apply it to your life and work. For people who don't like to read a ton of information before getting to work, this book is for you!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I am using a kindle fire and I could never get this app to run.  It just kept saying it was loading.  For days it said that.  finally I gave up
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Totally worth the price! It's a fantastic app for gun, and WW2 fanatics. Very realistic and fun. T t t t t
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is any ok puzzle game, but it only had 6 rooms to puzzle thru.  Lost interest once I found that out.
B00005JPKE|5.0|I purchased and watched this movie after my history professor suggested it.  I normally would not watch a movie in another language with subtitles, but this one really grabbed me and held onto me.  This battle happened years before I was born, but to see it through the eyes of the Japanese was very emotional.  The movie made it so personal, and I knew from history how it turned out, but was still hoping, for their sake, that they would not all die.  I don't choose to watch war movies, but if you have to watch just one, watch this one.  The guys on the other side are just like us.  I watched &#34;Flags of Our Fathers&#34; the day before I saw &#34;Letters from Iwo Jima,&#34; so saw both sides of the story - but this movie, Letters, was so much more gripping and sticking in the memory. Even as the Japanese soldiers saw their future slipping away, they had to cling to the bit of hope they had; and they each had to do what they thought was the right and honorable thing - for their country or for their families.
B0084B0656|4.0|I'm interested in the subject and he says it well. I do not like surveys.Is this enough?  Now I'm agrivated!
B000067QMD|5.0|I'm happy with the sealing discs; this will be great for keeping milk in my natural avent bottles! So far loving them.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sweet, funny, and satisfying.<br /><br />Always enjoy this author's work. She's hilarious.  Hope there's a movie. It would be so great!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|was a useful app prior to it's new format. now it is completely changed thongs keep popping up and blocking what you want to do.  I don't need achievement points for trying to watch the radar....I just want to know if I need an umbrella! I am going to uninstall. I bate it now!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I'm glad I didn't listen to the other reviews. The book is an easy read but a good one. It had good plot could use better transitioning but other than that it was a good free read.
0385523394|4.0|Very informative; a must read for young ladies who like to live on the wild side and think the &#34;gangsta life&#34; is the type of life they want.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a great, quick, and easy read! I would recommend it to any one! Enjoy! Now, on to \\"Catching Fire!\\"
B0000AK7AA|4.0|This casper had a good story line and the actors were perfect for their parts. The badboy ghosts made for some funny scenes along with the rest of the cast.  Good for all ages
6304117752|5.0|Love this movie, and tape was in great condition.  Will probably buy more to give to --grandkids keeping it going
0767802470|3.0|Depicted life on a sub at this point of the war well.<br />Was not filled with near the action I was hoping for but I'm sure nailed the boredom and helplessness part well.<br />To be fair, I was looking for a action warmovie (a little less reality and more heros and fighting)
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Good Condition  Excellent movie<br />Don't know what else to say.  We were adults during the time this movie represents, had no idea this was going on in the south
B00006CXSS|5.0|The remote that is.  Watched the 11 disks over and over during the 3 years I've owned it<br />As the title says this &#34;band of brothers&#34; are depicted from basic training throughout the wars end. You really get to know them personally and feel their pains and anguish and struggles but also enjoy there successes, the hot meal and the feeling of brother hood. I love the way they fit the gungho butt-kisser in throughout the show with class and let us all have our villain. Leaves us ready even more to cheer on all the heroes.<br />People make bad choices from generals to privates, but sometimes a band of brothers can smooth it over.<br />Sometimes weather or wondering are more devastating that bullets, but again the band of brothers make it through.<br />This move was very respectful to its audience and respectful about the troops and situations they faced.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Did you ever talk about an old great game to someone? Then go play that game with them and it just doesn't have that same greatness it did back in the day. Well Missile Defender is a cure for that! This game keeps what was great about Missile Command and adds just the right ingredients to keep that memory a good one and making new ones with Missile Defender. Just don't go back and play Missile Command. While it won't ruin what you now have with Missile Defender, it will ruin what you had with Missile Command.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I had absolutely no problems downloading and it is a very fun game just don't spend all your diamonds in one place.:)
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|i'm a huge fan of Robert B Parker's Jesse Stone character, and Tom Selleck has done an excellent job capturing his internal conflicts.  as all the Jesse Stone stories, although dealing with murder mysteries, there is a quietness of soul that these films evoke.
B00499K9E0|2.0|I was looking forward to this series.  The modern-day take on Sherlock Holmes stories and the actors were a big draw for me.  My disappointment after two episodes is that this Holmes is an irritating, arrogant, entitled prick of a man.  I don't think that was the SACD character.  The show writers seemed to want to pattern him on House, who at least had some vulnerability, occasional humility and redeeming compassion underneath his curmudgeonly persona.  Every time he ignores Watson or expects him to run errands like a servant and Watson does so helplessly grumbling under his breath, I cringe.  The power imbalance in their relationship contains elements of domestic abuse and it's disturbing.  This Sherlock is wholly unlikable and for me this renders his powers of observation and deduction less interesting.  He is a flat character.<br />On to number two reason:  the audience does not have the chance to see what he sees in his keen powers of observation.  We don't have the opportunity to see that the business executive's watch is a day behind and therefore he must have been travelling recently.  We don't get to see that the brand of hand soap in the boss's bathroom was the same brand as the secretary's hand lotion...the flash of the scene happened too fast.  But I guess that is just Sherlock's brilliance for you.  Irritating.<br />And finally, Sherlock seems have great luck picking up potential clues randomly (like one book among hundreds piled up and strewn in the dead guy's apartment) and against the odds that item has the clue he needed.  That one book among hundreds was a library book which of course took him to the library which of course the killer had spray painted on a shelf across from where the book would have been taken.  What?  There was no explanation why Sherlock would have selected that particular book (the first thing he picked up) or why the killer would have chosen the library to leave his coded graffiti threat for the victim, or how the victim wouldhave seen the threat behind the shelved library books that he wasn't even looking at.  If one of you brilliant reviewers could explain these events to me I would greatly appreciate it!  Otherwise I am outta this series.  Totally irritating.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|don't miss out on the Jesse Stone novels and movies by Robert B Parker.  Tom Selleck does an outstanding job bringing this character to film.
B0035OC7OU|5.0|This is a book I read at least once a year, and will continue to do so. Terry Pratchett has a bizarre wit that hides meaningful messages to the reader. Love it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bongo Blitz is a fun game. It is pretty addicting especially when you're winning. It seems impossible to win the entire game though....
B003WE9WRI|4.0|You must read this book. You would not want to be caught out in a zombie apocalypse and be plagued by indecision while the moaning dead shuffle closer to your friends and loved ones would you?
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|A superb reissue!  Plenty of extras in this set for all Allman Brothers fans - the rehearsal work provides insight on how hard this band works
B005XQLBU4|5.0|like it! it's a good replica of missile command from back in the day. or so I think<br />it is.
1401324649|1.0|I kept on reading this book, despite finding it extremely dissatisfying, until I got inspiration from a character, alas, already half way through. He says:<br /><br />\\"once I was forced to read the Bible and it was so boring I was about to die. It was not that somebody wanted to torture me, I did it out of curiosity\\"<br /><br />There and then I understood: that was was precisely my plight! And I stopped reading.
1612680011|5.0|To say anything negative about this book is outrageous. It's an amazing journey, amazing facts, and a great learning experience. Mr. Kiyosaki delivers with this great book. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Enjoy and kids enjoy this is a fun game for the whole family wish it didn't take as long to upgrade when the missiles coming at you keep upgrading faster but fun
B0041KBWM0|4.0|Found this show very interesting with good characters. Hang in there after the first episode. For me it was the weakest episode.
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|I'm not sure movies get any better than this one. Music, script and acting all combine to make a piece of art so wonderful, it lifts your spirit and makes you want to be a better human being. I just love this movie.
B005ES0YKO|5.0|I could get this pair for 15 dollars less than on the crocs website, i love them.... Very nice! Reccommended
B004AP9W46|5.0|Awesome read! If you like Ann rice,you will love this book.this was lestat s greatest adventure yet. I'm ready for the next one.
B00079ZACM|4.0|The Four Feathers.<br />An action packed film of the war in the Sudan during the 1800's even though it is fiction
0449011917|5.0|Being a fan of historical fiction,I could probably do without the dragons. ( unless, of corse they are allegorical).<br /><br />The characters are as real ( and cut-throat) as any of the Borgias.  Not only have I read all of the volumes, I have listened to the audio books and watched the tv series.
0761158820|5.0|Good entertainment for the boys.  Easy to make, nice colors, but a little small.<br />My 9 yr old can not stop making it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Must have in all android devices. It deletes all junk files and clears memory. Using it from last one year and no regrets.
0375842209|5.0|I am a voracious reader...lover or great fiction.......due to my present geographic location a lot flies under the radar.....a dear friend suggested this book....I am just shy of half way through its 550 pages. I have already sent a copy to my niece and another friend.<br />Yes...550 pages seems long...but the build and pacing and character development have been perfect. The tones and colors...the feel...it would have been epic failure to have done this in 1/2 the pages...robbery. I haven't come to the climax of the story admittedly..but I don't foresee disappointment....I am hoping the film will do justice....Bottom line...buy this book. Especially at amazon price.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A by the numbers but well made missile command clone. A little easy but still plenty of fun. A good faotd
B000I2JI80|5.0|I love shooting film and when this film is overexposed it produces beautiful pastel colors and gorgeous skin tones! It's one of my favorites!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A verry good game get it I enjoyed it and I am 12 I like horses so I got this game and just love it
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Wish there was more to do on free vision.<br />This game is responsible and interesting and just as t hard enough to be a challenge.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Get it while it's free! Super fun. Gets more challenging as you progress through the levels.worth paying too if you don't get it while it's free.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Classic game comes back...never forget the oldies...controls are very sensitive makes for a good game...highly recommend it hand eye coordination
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love the honesty of the characters rejecting heroic stereotypes and embracing normalcy. I love their candid love. And I love how Augustus Waters speaks.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Lags some on my phone buy works ok on my tablet over WiFi.  Still the options could be better and the controls could be much better.  This is a clone of Hill Climb Racing and that application works much better.  Still if you can get this one for free, it's worth checking out for something a little different.
0143038419|4.0|This book took off and flew in ways that only can be described as, acceleratingly  words of self help. I know that it is a non-fiction and some are even a autobiography/memoir. But I think I would, as above, also say very helpful way of telling ladies that even though you may have been knocked down, You can diffidently pick yourself up and go on.<br /><br />Author Elizabeth Gilbert has written with in the pages of this book a great way of putting your past behind and work toward your future.<br /><br />I loved it! I hated it! And I cried, laughed, screamed, even though I am married and my husband an I are truly happy, I can relate to this book from my childhood. My parents were divorced when I was very young. And I really wish that both of my parents could have read and been helped by this book.<br /><br />The only thing that I will say that this book was in some places a bit confusing, and that could just possible be on me. I will not go any further with in this book. Even though I am give this rating for this book, just know that I am going to place it on my self and if needed by others I can honestly relate this book to them.<br /><br />And so due to the above I am giving this book as of now a Breath of Life Rating of:<br /><br />Four Clock Rating!!!<br /><br />Disclosure: I did not receive this book in exchange for my review. But the opinions are mine, your opinion may differ, and that is fine with me.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|It is an amazing book and a great ending to the Wheel of Time series. Brandon Sanderson does good work in this novel.
0761169431|4.0|The item came quickly, but to my surprise it wasn't new!!! Item said new but book wasn't even wrapped in plastic.  Corners were bent and you can clearly see it had been used.  I thought I purchased a new one, but I guess I did not! Lol all in all I think it came with everything so ill give it a 4 star.  If the company is reading this, please understand that new means new and not newish, or in my case used!
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|I am a big wizard of oz fan and this just added to my collection. great, addition to my oz movies
B005XQLBU4|4.0|maybe something like splitting missiles or even a drone type robot and possibly an nonlinear battle where one person is the aliens and th other is the defender
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great movie and graphics, really liked the game. Think everyone will enjoy it. HARD game to put down mystery people will like it.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is one of those books that should be read by everyone, and most especially every elementary school-age kid. In fact, I propose that it should be required reading. I had the same experience reading this as I did with The Book Thief. I cried, I laughed, and in the end, I felt like a better person for having read it. This is the kind of book that makes you want to strive for more as a human being - it inspires understanding and kindness. The best children's book I've read all year!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|The graphics are absolutely fabulous. The story line is awesome, yet a little creepy. I think it's a amazing game.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very addictive loads of fun<br />Enjoy it daily<br />Very nice graphics just play lots and very responsive<br />Facebook linked well worth
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Power up doesn't always work correctly.  When I have 17 power ups left- it tells me to buy more. Also have 12 keys left. it would be nice if &#34;B&#34; points would add up more often when you sign on.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The whole series of books were good, after each book I wanted to read the next. This last book put the finishing touches to the whole series and didn't want it to be over. Overall a very good book.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was beyond amazing. It was hard for me to get into the first few pages but curiosity killed the cat after chapter 1 I was hooked! I cannot wait to see the movie. Ill finally be able to watch in screen what i envisioned in my mind while reading this book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Best game I've played from this company and look forward to playing more. Great graphics and I never knew what was gonna jump out at me but I loved anticipating it!  GREAT JOB!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So easy to use.  Love it. I don't usually shop online but but this is so easy, my husband will hate it. Lol
B000VMFDW2|5.0|It was a great read. I enjoyed hearing it straight from the horses mouth. I will never understand how they did it. but thank God they did.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked this book so much that I cried at some parts of the book! Thank you R. J. Palacio.
B005544TRQ|3.0|A pleasant diversion, but a formulaic comedy. Ok, but not great. If there's nothing else to watch and nothing else to do.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is an exciting series full of action. It is a joy to watch. The characters are well developed and interact with each other well.  I can wait until the next season is ready on Roku.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A bit too repetetive but still fun. Needs more difference between the stages. Good adaptation of the old arcade game.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|I watched the adventures of the star ship Enterprise when it was on TV a long time ago. I am enjoying the many Star Trek-TNG episodes now on Roku. Captain Picard is an excellent example of a leader for the adults and for the children in the audience.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so addicting.  once u get the hang of it. each time I play all I can even think about is out scoring my last run.  challenging friends is exciting too
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|I watched the adventures of the star ship Enterprise when it was on TV a long time ago. I am enjoying the many Star Trek-TNG episodes now on Roku. Captain Picard is an excellent example of a leader for the adults and for the children in the audience.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a lot of fun to play. Good to pass the time. Hope there is something cool that gets added as I progress so we'll see.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I grew up playing Missile Command on the Atari 2600.  This game is clearly influenced by that classic and does it credit.  The graphics look nice and the game play is fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so fun to play on survival u can do a buntch I think I sound weard But what ever
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Loved the old missile command and this is a very good variation on that. Unlike some others I did not have any warnings from my virus scanner so hopefully that was just a temporary glitch.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I guess you never know if it's good or bad until you try something .  Some of the apps are interesting and fun and some not so much.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun for passing the time, a few more challenges would be nice but overall entertaining especially for free. levels slightly repetitive.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Musically this record is very good.I dont like satanic lyrics, but musically this is very good band.I saw this band live this summer first time and i led me to decision to buy this record too.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I bought this as a birthday present.  I was told that this was an excellent gift.  They thanked me repeatedly for the gift.
B002ZG98J6|1.0|I also read these books, along with A Princess of Mars, on which John Carter was based.  John Carter is a marvelous film in spite of the necessary changes to a very complex book, while Percy Jackson is a book that would've been a great movie, but fails in nearly every way.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying John Carter for anyone who's dazzled by fantastic imagination and story telling on the silver screen.  If Disney hadn't totally botched the marketing, it would have it's own sequels, which is a darn shame when compared to this drivel.
1442358238|5.0|I am so excited to get this.  We are planning a road trip to Florida and needed something to listen to on the way. So nice to find a different book to listen to. We love Mary Higgins Clark so are very excited to listen to this book.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|Ray proves that he was one of the most versatile artists ever. I bought this album because Ray was not an ordinary entertainer who did country songs, he was an extrordinary entertainer who did country songs and kept it COUNTRY. Unlike today's artist's who are labeled country and can't help but prove they are really ROCK & ROLL.
1449410243|5.0|Bought this for our cat-sitters, who also have cats. Thumbed through it and almost didn't give it up. If I don't get to borrow it, I'll be buying one for myself.
1781162646|4.0|Nice escape reading and seemed to me to be well written.  I have read other Stephen King works as well.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was unsure at first, do I want to play a creepy game with Zombies in it?  Well come to find out.  I love killing them.  Eat my plants will yeah.  (Cherry Bomb!) Take that you dead thing.... I am still stuck on getting through survival level. Of the first game. Will gradually get to Zombies II.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon. Com, for helping with My App Store, and having the game available.<br /><br />Back to the game:  I love the music also.... da, da, data da don......
B009KS4XRO|4.0|bingo blitz...fun, interactive, entertainment.<br />The only thing I don't like is that we don't have the option of trading in coins for bingo credits.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Really love it, exceed my expectations, really enjoy using it!!! I am using it daily and have a lot of fun!!!!!!:D
B0062QRTKA|5.0|great awsome spectacular worthy of five star great story great for kids i could go on forever. i love it
B00030DEQE|4.0|Had some issues with my PC not accessing the internet and it seemed to be network and not PC related.  The only issue with that assumption is my many other networked devices had no issues.  PC was able to ping gateway but nothing else and DNS wasn't working.  After restoring the entire OS back to factory (suspecting a virus, rootkit or other that Virus software didn't pick up lead me to this), I figured out &#34;That's not it!&#34; to my dismay.  Next step was NIC card... ordered this and everything worked like a champ.<br /><br />Thus my review title &#34;Works&#34;<br /><br />Trusted Intel Chipset is always a good way to go.
1452126577|5.0|I bought  the Grumpy Cat book as a birthday present for a friend who loves cats and enjoys seeing Grumpy Cat on Facebook. She is thrilled to bits with it and it is very amusing. A must for any cat or animal lover or anyone that likes a good laugh.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The graphics are fine.  Not great, but they work.  The gameplay is very good.  Response is quick and<br />accurate.  Works better than the original track ball.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I really love this CD. They always put out a great record. I think my favorite song is Counting Stars, it just gets u pumped for the rest of the CD. If u are a OR fan then definitely add this to your collection u wont be sorry.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|so fun seeing how music was really DONE back in the day of the big-boards. Neve was such an interesting character in this story of how MY music was created. Thanks David - good job bringing the history into this documentary. If you grew up with 1970-80's rock bands, you'll totally appreciate this one.
B008220BLG|5.0|This was a really good move. It was funny, romantic, scary, suspenseful everything in one. I would recommended this move to anyone. I laughed out loud a few times. It had me cheering for the zombies.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|First off let me say this was a great movie.  Was an awesome twist on an old story.  That said leme get into some things.<br /><br />1.  The naysayers, the people who dislike this movie because it is based on an old story.  Or perhaps the ones who are upset because its not a 70 year old, overweight William Shatner in a starfleet uniform.  Don't listen to them.  There will always be people who have a reason to dislike something, and just because they say something sucks, doesn't mean they are right.  Some people just don't take to change well, and its a shame.<br /><br />2.  The movies of yesteryear are timepieces for sure, as I am sure this will be at a later date.  The story was good, plot-holes and all.  If you want a story without plot-holes, something that doesn't make you think, then go ahead and write your fan fiction.  Otherwise, keep it to yourself.<br /><br />Alright, ranting aside.<br /><br />I will definitely watch this again.  The cast was enjoyable, the story was worthy, and contrary to negative belief, it was indeed Star Trek.  Were there things I would change, yes of course, but you cant fault an artist for what his vision may be.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love his game it is awesome  I lobe it you should definitely buy it I highly recommend this game for all ages.you have your own horse and get to compete.it's like having a real horse of my own
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It keeps you guessing and your brain turning good way to pass the time! Very clever. I like the different rooms in one puzzle.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Best series since twilight. Can't put the book down. Finished booked 2 in two days. Buying the third today. Can't wait to read it
B00CJGP116|5.0|It's a long time coming to hear something new from the great  Marc Anthony, it's a grand slam que viva Puerto Rico.
0064471837|5.0|Loved as a kid and still love today. A well-constructed fantasy that also has amazing depths of darkness to keep from being another cutesy adventure. Truly a gem of a story.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|This app contains malware. Others reviews said it, antivirus jumped as soon as it was installed, malware. Amazon app store should be more careful.
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Downloaded and immediately picked up as high security threat by Kaspersky Mobile Security! Said app posed high probably of malicious use! Immediately deleted,  BE CAREFUL with this one.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Lots of fun, just annoying that they limit playing time unless you buy tokens. Have  to wait 45 mins between games typically unless you get lucky on the scratch tickets and win extra tokens.
0783232039|5.0|this movie is really creepy and scary but my kids love it so i encourage everyone to see it !
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think all boys love this game. My grandson plays it on his laptop and Colton watched him for days and then we saw it was available on his kindle. He loves it!!
B005XQLBU4|1.0|I have loved missile defender games in the past, but obviously without malware. Game contains dubious extras. Trustgo Security found a low risk threat, PUA!smspay.A@Android. I have a wifi only tablet but uninstalled anyway
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|Despite the actors doing their best to ruin a classic, the author shines through yet again. I love Sherlock but not Elementary. Lucy Lu is poorly cast -- she's not good enough an actor to express the surprise and indignation that Watson (as a representative of the audience) is expected to. The actor playing Sherlock lacks charisma. Too monotone, trying too hard to be something he's not. The cases are also miles less interesting than the BBC mini-series and certainly the movies.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very informative and thorough.  Really explains diabetes, cholesterol, kidney disease, etc.  I was one who was told to eat more whole wheat grains to my detrimate.  Thank you Dr. Davis for such a well researched book.  I am sticking to no wheat and my blood sugars have improved and in the 110 - 125 range.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is awesome. It has been a long time since I have played it and this app does not miss a beat.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|So glad we purchased this on DVD. I loved it when we had the VHS tape, but when the player quit we decided we needed to purchase the DVD.
B000I9YWN4|5.0|Best and funniest movie ever who's funnier than Jimmy and queen out them together and. Your in for a great laugh fest
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|This is a good story with a clear dystopian (big brother is watching you) plot. The only downfall was the story was on the slow side to get going. This is probably because this is the first in a trilogy. I went ahead and ordered the second book to see where the story goes (mainly because it was only a $1) button it hadn't been for ,y book club deciding to read this I probably wouldn't have read it. I have read and LOVED other dystopian like books, 1984, the giver, hunger games, Fahrenheit 451... Here is hoping the second book it better. By the way this story reminds me of the movie Equilibrium.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I thought this movie was great. Good cast, good acting, good action, good story and plot. I felt it was a really good take on a classic story.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Catchy, bluesy rhythms, fascinating chord progressions, and mostly trivial lyrics.  You can also see a certain musical growth within the framework of 3 minute pop hits.  What's not to like?
B0041KKYEW|5.0|This movie is so well done. Natalie Portman is such a good actress and she does such a good job. Every time I watch it there's something new I see each time some little thing that make its better and more chilling.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|A great selection of later Beatle numbers.  Not just #l hits but other interesting stuff, and no Ono inspired dreck or useless sitar/mystic nonsense.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B004S49YEM|5.0|a credible book obviously based on the truth behind the planning of the Normand invasion. Kept me going right to the end with not too much descriptive blood and guts just enough to make the Needle real.
B007X2JV0S|5.0|This music is absolutely amazing. It is such a great accompaniment to the epic show that they created. Total 5 stars material.
1878424319|5.0|I bought this book, and I enjoyed it as it made me think what my life has been, Every single agreement brought back so many memories that I  experienced during my childhood. How I have changed during all these years and how much still at 73 I have to change. Wonderful experience.
B003DFJW9E|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great and funny book. I have read all of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and i liked them a lot.
0545265355|5.0|I love the Hunger Games series. Its a well written book that isn't about a girl falling in love with a boy. Its about survival and fighting for the right side. Its just great and Katniss just makes a perfect main character.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's a fun game and I like to play it now give me 50#repair points<br />Online<br />20 word numbness I don't like<br />Cowboy bebop lives on in my mind<br />No the games sucks
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B00AZRBLHO|3.0|Perhaps the idea was to introduce the concepts of DevOps and Continuous delivery to management. Maybe the idea was to convince companies that IT is a critical part of any company. This book does convey those messages, but the unbelievably bad situations the company had gotten itself into just didn't work for me. The solutions they came up with were good, but there is not much in this book to sink your teeth into. The concepts of DevOps and Continuous Delivery are not clearly described.<br />It's a novel. I shouldn't have expected more.
B000CNE092|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I liked this.  Bribed me with upgrade credit to rate it though.  Eh, I don't mind.  I haven't been playing it very long at all though, would rather rate it later, but for uograde credit...why not.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not quite the fun of a roller ball and picking the base the missile comes from but still a good time.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|Who doesn't love James Bond? Especially Daniel Craig who does just a fabulous job as his predecessors did. Casino Royale is better but its still a great 007 film.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love this CD, it has everything from upbeat to haunting, every song is beautiful in its own way. Lindsey is a very talented young lady!
B004LUS390|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B004856SQ8|1.0|Don't waste your time or money, this dumper should've been called \\"The F-Team\\". There's a reason this thing flopped in the theaters, and Rotten Tomatoes. And with every critic who isn't a flack for the studio that made it. Please, please send this stinkbomb to cable syndication, 4:3 format. You know, so Infommercial actors have someone to look down on. One star is too kind, it deserves a zero.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Not something I would play everyday but a good time consuming game. If only the points would go up a bit more.

B008PUF3VS|4.0|I finished this book in less than a day<br />I know it's a kids book but its a great read<br />It tell the story of the holocaust from the perpective of a soldiers son and it details his friendship with a young Jewish boy very moving and sad<br />Sensitively written

B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just like the good ole' days at the arcade, just think of all the money I spent and now look, I'm back at it, just like the good ole' days, but now, no quarters!!!!
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|This is movie is kind of stupid but I really like it. The premise is kind of like x-men but with more high school drama and absurdness thrown in.
B0084I2PEO|3.0|The book is very well written, but I didn't care for the subject matter. I like upbeat books, but this had too many horrible, tragic events in it. The only reason I bought it was that my daugher had a list of depressing books to choose from to read for school, and this is the one she chose. After she was done with it, I read it too, just to know what she was up against (we both prefer comedies).<br /><br />That said, while many parts were hard to stomach, I have to give the author credit for being able to grab and keep the reader's attention. Thankfully it did include a few positive highlights here and there and it ended on a fairly positive note. If not for the genre, I would have rated it higher. Fair or not, it is what it is.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This new version of the WC totally sucks.  I'm not sure where to begin; but I do know where I'm going to end.  After this review  I will delete this app for good.

B007REV4YI|5.0|I loved this movie. Daniel Craig does such a good job as James Bond and the idea that MI-6 isn't as safe a facility as we thought is such a good premise. Totally love it. And Ben Whishaw as the new Q was just great, he does such a great job and I can't wait to see him  in the next one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|awesome gun it in temple run 2 you take risks so much exitment! you have to try it awesome fun ya

B00004RJ74|2.0|Wow! What a load of crap we have here.  Anything original? Nope. Great special effect do not a movie make, I don't care how many big names you put in it. This is not a scary vampire movie; more like a vampire comedy.  Cheech and Salma Hyak are great, of course.
B00006ADD5|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|Simply great songs and great singing by one of the greatest entertainers of all time.  Elvis could do it all and it's too bad he didn't live to prove just how great he really was.  Nice rendition of &#34;Movin On&#34; as originally recorded by Hank Snow.
B00005JLR2|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B00EFNXPFK|4.0|Let me first start this review by saying that I much prefer John Mayer's earlier style. I share the common belief that Continuum was his best album, and I wish that he'd go back to his blues sound. That being said, I think a review should be written on what an album is, not what people want it to be.<br /><br />This is, essentially, Born and Raised part 2. This is not a bad thing. It's mostly folksy, country-style easy listening, and I enjoy it. However, it doesn't \\"wow\\" me like Mayer's Continuum or even Room for Squares did. There is not a single song from his first 4 albums that I would skip over, but I would definitely skip a few off of this (same goes for Born and Raised, so it may be an issue that I simply don't like this style of music as much.) Still, there were a few tracks that I really did enjoy and find myself listening to them over and over, namely Dear Marie, Paper Doll, You're No One til Someone Lets You Down, and both Wildfire trakcs (yes, Frank Ocean's track does seem completely out of place and kind of weird, but I enjoy it.)<br /><br />One star deduction for the overuse of obvious autotune/voice enhancement (you know what I'm talking about here.) It makes some these stripped down folk-style songs seem too poppy. And Katy Perry's bit didn't really do it for me.<br /><br />Overall, this is another solid Mayer album. If you're a fan of Born and Raised, you'll love this. If you've never listened to John Mayer but enjoy an album that'll make you feel like you're sitting on a porch in the middle of Montana looking at the mountains, then pick this up!
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|This is a totally perfect romantic feel-good movie. If you wanna cry, and smile this is it. Great cast, great acting, its just overall great.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|I think is good, nothing impressive but good to waste time, you have to avoid being attacked by missiles louching some missiles
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|...and for good reason! I am now done with the first season on DVD. If I had to describe this series in a single sentence, It would be: Abbott and Costello spend a \\"Weekend at Bernie's\\" in \\"Fargo\\".<br />Without Walter's lung cancer and the sometimes gruesome crime aspects of the show, it would be totally worth watching as a situation comedy.<br />Let's recap the main family characters: 50 yr. old Walter White (Bryan Cranston) could not be anymore square as the high school chem teacher until he learns of the life changing cancer. Wife Skylar (Anna Gunn) is a continually bewildered bystander...and pregnant. Teenage son Walt Jr. is handicapped (CP?) but for the most part he gets it. Sis-in-law Marie is a kleptomaniac married to Hank, who is some kinda DEA cop.<br />So the prideful Walter must figure out how to pay for his cancer treatment. He is exposed to the idea of big bucks in cooking crystal meth through Hank's drug busts, and hooks up with Jesse, a loser, stoner, small time meth dealer and coincidentally a (bad) former student of Walter. And of course the brilliant chemist Walter is capable of cooking up the best crystal meth to ever hit the streets of Albuquerque, NM, so his talent becomes quickly recognized and valued in the \\"biz\\". From there, murder, mayhem and drug deals gone bad ensue and the series takes on the personality of the Coen Brothers' \\"Fargo\\". OK, now strap on your seat belt because every minute will either have you aghast in disbelief or rolling on the floor laughing your ass off.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Absolutely, hands down, the best book I have read for this age group in a very long time! Cried, laughed, and was inspired so many times I lost count! I CAN'T WAIT TO READ IT TO MY STUDENTS!!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game gets you hooked from the very start.  the visuals are great, some of the levels are a little easier than others and some are pretty hard to get through, but all in all, a fun game
0316232955|5.0|This is just another great book from Chris Colfer. I don't how he's so good at everything but this is just a really good example of great writing.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|I absolutely love this product. I frequently wear gloves made of many different materials. This product allows me to utilize my electronic devices with ease while enjoying my favorite fashion accessories! It's very easy to apply, I would recommend two coats to allow the product to fully synthesize with the gloves. I'm so grateful that this kind of product exists. I struggled for many years, being a big glove fan, but constantly feeling inhibited by the lack of movement and accessibility. Now, I have no shame in wearing my gloves whenever I want! This product truly is a no brainer. We are in the new technological age, we have to be able to access our devices, no matter what we are wearing. If you live in a cold weather environment, you must utilize this product. Living in Colorado for 4 years throughout college, I wish I had anyglove at my disposal! I know I will be passing this on to my friends. Buy a bottle today, you will love the results! :-)
B008393Q2O|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.

0316201545|5.0|This is just another great book from Chris Colfer. I don't how he's so good at everything but this is just a really good example of great writing and a very creative imagination.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I just wanted a cheap basic cover that was 50% off and I chose this one. It does what it is suppose to. Keep the Kindle safe.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is a fun game, addicting actually. Although i think that the repair amounts are quite ridiculous. But overall it is cool
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love the game but Would be better if you could send or trade dragons to your friends or other people
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am not sure if John Green knows exactly what goes on inside a 16-year-old girl's head, but whether it's exactly accurate matters not.  The dialogue is energetic, humorous, thoughtful and poignant.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B00A285OOW|5.0|A great weekend read.  It swept me away and enchanted me with the skillful writing to that far and away time period.  The book is a must-read for anyone who loves historic fiction.  Good job Phillippe!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie is absolutely fabulous. Yes it is long but it just brings the story to life and cast is totally perfect.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|Nice graphics on my Nexus 7 2013, I expend hours playing it.<br />The puzzles are nice and not to hard to solve.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Agony, ecstasy, triumph, and loss in love.  They are all here. I would advise not listening to this album while driving.  You might just run right off the road.
031620157X|5.0|This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Forget everything you know about fairytales. Once Upon a Time rewrites everything in a very clever way, intertwining the events surrounding each character flawlessly and briliantly. The effects, for a television series, are amazing and the acting superb. When I heard the second season was coming out on DVD I preordered it in a heartbeat. Now my brother and I are watching it together and it is keeping us at the edge of our seats all the way.To anyone who loves fantasy, adventure, and all the things you loved about fairytales growing up and wants to see something different on TV, I guarantee you'll love this show.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is a totally awesome movie. I've seen it at least 10 times and its always funny. I highly recommend it.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I love this movie so much! One of my all time favorites!I recommend it more than alot of other movies haha.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love this movie. Its full of stupid jokes and great characters. Vectors a great villain and Gru is just this awesome awkward villain turned hero. Totally awesome.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I freaking love this movie. Every time I see it it makes me smile and I just fall more in love. It just makes you want to be a kid again who believes in everything and just sees the good it everything. The cast they chose is top notch, perfect combination and the actors totally fit their characters.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really love the multiple alarm feature. Also, that it plays for several minutes then auto turn off after two cycles! I haven't tried the sleep set yet...great app!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a thrill you will not want to put it down! Suzanne Collins describes things so vividly, it's like I'm in the arena following everything! Read unroll the end!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Much easier controls than the trackball mission command version. Brings back good memories of classic Atari but updated. Classic fun
0385523912|5.0|This book is as captivating as a human story as it is informative as a political description of what goes on in North Korea. There are for sure more stories to tell from the hundreds of thousands, whose families living in Communist are still torn apart
B0046UGSNS|1.0|The movie hit the apparent marks for the Oscars - homosexuality, plenty of porn, and strong actors.  If only the story was worth your time.  The description highlights it as a comedy but instead the movie shows a sad story of life spinning perhaps all too naturally beyond anyone's control.  I sat down with the goal of finding entertainment and instead I'd just like my hour and a half back.
B007AL48UK|5.0|This game is excellent when you want to unwind. It is challenging but not overwhelming. I play this while on break at work, waiting for my kids or just winding down at home. I was not disappointed.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Both my daughter and I love this game.  We play  together on her on her Kindle . Me on mine.  We just love all the animals
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Well written, funny, great plot, what more can you ask for. I didn't think I was going to enjoy this book that much but I'm looking forward to reading book 2. I usually have a bit of trouble reading YA from a male perspective. Also, through a male author. Usually I feel like male writers of YA try to live vicariously through the main character by being a complete ladies man and acting like a douche but not this author. Kevin Hearne was able to create a really likeable character.  The humor was spot on and now I really want a Irish wolf hound as a pet.<br /><br />I'm also so used to romance playing a key part in YA books that involve the paranormal but not in this book. I'm glad there was no twilight-esque romance. I'm sick of team whoever. I'm not totally against romance aspect if its done properly and not cheesy. Perhaps in future books Atticus will find a woman but for now I like him just chillin with Oberon.
1451626096|5.0|This is one of the best in the Cousins' War series.  Gregory has outdone herself, yet again.  If she writes it, I will buy it, read it and share it.  Keep up the great work!

B005XQLBU4|3.0|It is nice to see a simple game to pass the time.  Enjoy playing the game, especially with my four year old.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|1st heard her song, Royals, on WCLZ, and couldn't find the CD at the local music stores (like Bull Moose). Ordered the CD (it was sold out, but I ordered anyways...hoping to get it once it became available, again), and waited. It didn't come (not surprisingly), but I received an email from Amazon telling me of a lesser charge since I'd been enjoying the music via the cloud player and had downloaded it to my pc and ipod. I guess the review should be about how Amazon handled their inability to fulfill the CD order, and charge for the download. I would give 4 stars for that. But, still...5+ for Lorde.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Love this series!  It's along the lines of Hunger Games, Divergent, etc... but different enough than both to really keep your interest.  Not quite as much &#34;death&#34; and more sweetness... good summer read.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good quick fun. Easy to understand and quick to learn.  Seems well balanced.  Gets difficult quickly so it's not great for kids.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series!  As they say... if you liked 50 Shades, you'll like this series.  Kept me reading and I'm glad it's continuing!
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Excellent first season of Awkward.  I especially love the school counselor and her super inappropriate interactions with Jenna and the other students.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This is definitely a well written, interesting book... just a little harder for me to relate to the character.  But it's a very interesting look at a different future..
B009NPA3Q4|2.0|I was almost tempted to say I hate it, but changed it to I don't like it to be nice.  Very depressing music, for the most part.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|I read this book under duress on a recommendation from a friend, and I while it took me forever to get into it, it's actually a good story.  The movie stayed pretty close to the book, which I liked, and I liked the way they had some comedic relief in the movie as well.
B006PAV1XO|4.0|Or is this suppose to be somewhere else?  It is just that so many scenes are exact reproductions of some of my memories of the 80's at Six Flags Over Georgia.  Or do they all look like that?
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Read the entire series pretty quickly.  Kept my interest and was an interesting take on the future.  Another good tween series.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I think this is a great basic calculator for daily use, such as keeping track of the check book. I like how it displays the calculation with the result, so you can easily check your number entries.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I'm so addicted. So much fun. Reminds me of an old game I had as a kid called desert storm.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm not a fan of social media (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, etc) but I do LOVE pinterest.  I'm an organizer and this is perfect to look at my boards and pins on my Kindle Fire HD.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I'm a planner and must write everything down so I won't forget. I use post-its at work like they're going out of style. I'm in love with this app. It is so helpful to have different color post-its to keep my organized.
0684857219|5.0|This book has it all and even for people who are not interested in competitive bodybuilding.<br /><br />The workout plans are balanced and increase in difficulty.  It explains how you should develop a workout plan instead of telling you what you should do.  Highly recommend this book.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I bought this after my husband purchased me a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas.  While I LOVE that my Kindle goes into sleep mode when the cover is closed, I find it difficult to use this as a standing case.  It seems to slip if not in an exact position.  It is possible my three-year-old has worn it out.
B000002ITK|4.0|Despite their numbskull reputation Twisted Sister have the sort of legacy given to any band that is so utterly over the top. And with Dee Snider being such a preferred talking head for multiple documentaries on hard `n' heavy music there is to this day (as I type in 2013) a certain mystique to a band that accomplished so much via passion and shock value (though maybe not so much via buttocks kicking tunes).<br /><br />So on this sixteen track best of what do we get? Well as other reviewers have noted this is probably all the casual fan would ever want;<br /><br /># The hits. We get We're Not Gonna Take It, we score I Wanna Rock and also You Can't Stop Rock `n' Roll.<br /><br /># Salient tracks. We get the PMRC riling Under the Blade amongst other fan favourites such as I Am (I'm Me).<br /><br /># Curios. Well not necessarily curios but the brace of live tunes at the end of the album may be of interest to many due to the way this band built so much of its following on the back of their early live touring work ethic.<br /><br /># Dross. Yep, there is some. The pubescent sentiments of I'll Never Grow Up, Now! do grate a bit. Talk about pandering to your perceived audience. Honestly if this sort of guilty pleasure sentiment is to be seen in a backwardly acceptable light then it is the DAD song I Won't Cut My Hair and not this. And you can pretty much say the same about Bad Boys (Of Rock 'n' Roll).<br /><br />The odd miss aside this is a fun look at a band with a place in hard rock history.
B00DW5IKJI|4.0|I love Britney Spears! Although I'm not a big fan of her, I like some of her songs (principally her biggest hits, which are included in this album), so when I heard about this \\"best of\\" album, I knew I had to buy it! It's the most complete compilation album of Britney, because it starts from her 1999 debut until today. So, if you want to buy a best of album of Britney, this is the right one. But some songs are missing. Come on, where's \\"I Love Rock and Roll\\"? Everybody remembers the scene from Crossroads. And all original versions should had been put in the album, not remixes. But I'm not complaining. You get all her biggest hits for the price of one album, it's a great offer! Buy it.
1434441636|5.0|Wonderfully written. The content is not new to someone in my line of work but the way it's created it is an excellent book to read a chapter every day as a conscious reminder or to learn about how the subconscious works for those that want to greatly expand their horizons!
B00A7CI82I|2.0|Though all of the original Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) movies are almost exactly the same (lol) they were all riveting, fun, fast paced and well-acted.  This one?  Boring.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and nothing really ever did.  Jeremy Renner's character just walks around looking stoic and determined and there was absolutely no chemistry between him and Rachel Weiss.  Ed Norton's character was boring and unconvincing as well.  It looked like these people just showed up and read their lines and didn't put much into it.  Perhaps it was the directing?  Even the script was poor.<br /><br />Though the Bourne series in general is not the most original and the writing was so-so, somehow the first 3 with Matt Damon worked while this one didn't.  Top notch actors, but something was way off.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I gave subway surfers this rating because of my children. It is so easy to learn that my 3yr old has mastered the game and not to talk about my 6 yr old. I was amazed without any instructions from me or anything. This is good for children and adults, it develops your flexibility and ability to multitask as well. Great game. My six year old is also learning about money and value of money from the game when he has to buy certain items etc. Great tool
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Mind twisting game. Very fun. I love all the puzzles. All around great game. Very good for being free. I can play it all day
0425263908|3.0|I'm trying. I'm really trying with these books, but it seems I just can't win. This is the millionth time I've read a novel based off reviews and the millionth time I've scratched my head in confusion. In this case, it's for BARED TO YOU (CROSSFIRE #1). Sigh.<br /><br />BARED TO YOU tells the story of Eva Tramell. She's got all the characteristics necessary for a contemporary romance heroine: 20-something, gorgeous (but unaware), wealthy (because of her STEP-father, more on this later) and troubled. She meets Gideon Cross who also has all the characteristics necessary for a contemporary romance love interest: 20-30 something, gorgeous/magnetic/virile (and he knows it), wealthy/accomplished/smart (because if he were stupid, really what would be the point?) and you guessed it: troubled.<br /><br />He is also jealous, possessive and prone to operating in extremes. He's extremely withdrawn, or extremely needy. He's extremely romantic or extremely tense. It's a whiplash of emotions with this one.<br /><br />Eva's mother is over-protective and her father lives on the opposite end of the country. Her mother has remarried Richard Stanton, a mega-rich businessman and he funds whatever Eva wants, but doesn't want. She lives in a super-expensive apartment, but doesn't want Stanton to phone in some nepotism at a high powered firm of his choice (even though she most likely got her position at the advertising firm she works at because of him). Then you have Gideon, who we know is troubled, but don't know why (I'm sure the sequel will tell us) and who is so perfect. That's the scope of his character development: \\"ice blue eyes\\" and beauty.<br /><br />I think my problem with the story lies with the fact that there is nothing outside of the two characters save for their interest in fornicating. That's literally ALL that is of interest to them. There is no character growth. There are challenges (the reasons why they're so \\"troubled\\"), but that seems to have been added so that the novel couldn't have just been called pornography in print or so that we could be graced with some extremely maudlin scenes. Or maybe so the characters could be prone to jumping to conclusions without taking all of 5-seconds to think it over as to move the plot along.<br /><br />I also couldn't take the dialog. Everything is \\"so d*** [good/hot/beautiful/etc.].\\" Sylvia Day is obviously an accomplished writer and her writing flows, but it was statements like the aforementioned that took me out of the story. Also, the jealousy bit. It's understandable to an extent, but once I start to feel as though the main characters would get jealous if Godzilla gave their significant other a look, my eyes start rolling.<br /><br />I understand the reasons for romance novels. I read them, after all. If I wanted something heavy, I'd pull out some 19th century literature and what not, but I don't think the fact that a reader may seek out a breezy read means that it has to be 200-300 some-odd pages of stilted, unrealistic dialog and perfect people with \\"problems.\\" It wasn't bad. I just wasn't a fan.
B00DSOG0QS|4.0|Fun, entertaining, and different. That pretty much sums it up. I was amazed at how light and humorous this book was in spite of the plot. The plot seemed very dark, and it was - there was a body discovered that was infected with a deadly disease. The people who found the body were quarantined, and there was a terrorism connection, which made this all the more terrifying. But the main characters were so quirky; the husband and wife who work for the CDC, their three teen-aged children, and the Homeland Security agent (who ended up in a threesome with the husband and wife). They were definitely an odd bunch, and it was fun getting to know them. The family was also super rich. I'm not particularly fond of reading about rich people since I find them to be very hard to relate to, but they didn't seem snobby or pompous. And they were all geniuses - except for the youngest son. The story was told through his point of view (sort of), and I really did feel for him. He was a smart kid, but everyone around him was smarter and always one step ahead of him. He even went to a private school full of geniuses. Yikes, that would seriously hurt a young kid's self-esteem.<br /><br />The story was engaging, and I kept wanting to read more so I could find out what was going to happen. It was interesting to see how everything tied together. I was also curious to see how this threesome would develop! The author uses a casual writing style, so it was an easy (and quick) read.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and I'm looking forward to the continuation of the series!

But the story had so many holes and predictable plot lines. This could have been the #1 sci-fi movie of the year with a better script. And the ending.... Huh? I was left wondering exactly what happened! Ultimately, a let down.

I've tried it on every platform since hoping to recreate the magic but a PC and phone can't replicate the roller ball and three button firing interface. This game gets it right.

B0000000KW|5.0|The influence of Jeff Lynn, Phil Ramone and band mates if old are all over this album.  Refreshing sounds that I miss.  A guitar sound that is no longer played today is done so well here by Mark Hudson. So many great fillers that you so infrequently hear in produced music any more.  A few of these songs should get more air time now such as &#34;Don't Go Where the Road Don't Go&#34;, &#34;Weight of the World,&#34; and &#34;After All These Years&#34;. &#34;After All These Years&#34; has the influence of Jeff Lynne all over it and makes me wish the collaboration of Jeff Lynne and Ringo happens again soon.  An often overlooked album brings great charm and joy.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|Very true to sound.  Some complained about them not having enough bass or being &#34;flat&#34;, if you know how to use your equalizer on your device, they sound amazing.  I use them for movies, games, and music.  Especially good for gaming, allowing the user to listen to ambient sounds in the background with great detail.  Also the noise blockage feature is really nice for the user and anyone else that might be around, it does block the noise really well both ways.  These headphones are also really comfortable for a long time and they seem quite well made.  I have not had them a long time, but they seem as if they will stand the test of time quite well.  The carry case is not anything amazing but should help keep dust and dirt out of these when they travel around in my backpack.

B00AIBZM40|5.0|I hardly know where to begin discussing a film that moves me so. Yes, it's a kind of ghost story, and perhaps the best I've seen since\\"Ghost Story.\\" Those who say it is derivative may feel that way because the tale draws on archetypal images, fears, the kind of history that brings forth both ghosts and our (reluctant) belief in their possible existence. So yes, ghost story, certainly. Again, kind of.<br /><br />But it's much more than that. It's a look at belonging in one world or the next, and raises questions, blurring the line as sweetly and poignantly as del Toro's wonderful \\"The Orphange,\\" or to a lesser extent, \\"The Devil's Backbone.\\" There is a moment near the end that will refocus the entire film. It's magnificent.<br /><br />At the level of pure cinema, it's beautifully done, with sensitive cinematography and spot-on editing, acting that makes you forget acting, and a character arc in the Jessica Chastain character that is as startling as it is believable. Effects are subtle most of the time. There are scary moments, but always there is that rich campfire feeling of a great fable, a story from early man's deepest and most intimidating questions. It is a tragic tale that rises fully to that difficult status, and then bursts through into something quite different, and very beautiful.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Mama\\" is a story of love, of rage, of nurturance and danger, of sacrifice, and of mystery. I love what the brother/sister team of Andrés and Barbara Muschietti have created, I treasure the clear and pervasive influence of Guillermo del Toro, his ability to dance with such effortless grace between two worlds. If \\"Mama\\" touches you as it does me, you will hold onto your copy for dear life. If not, it's a fun ghost story, and that's fine. But it is so very much more.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I can watch anything on my TV with just an HDMI cable. Awesome technology! This is helpful in replacing the monthly cable bill.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|As a Lee Child/Jack Reacher fan and a Tom Cruise carper, I did not expect to like this film. As many have noted, the sculpted, narcissistic, and frankly too-short Cruise was an unlikely choice to play Jack Reacher, who is almost a foot taller than Cruise and who studiously avoids the lime-light. But Cruise is surprisingly up to the part. His manner is dry and understated, quite Reacher-like, and he gives the other actors plenty of room. That's a good thing because Rosamund Pike is captivating as Helen Rodin, the defense attorney with whom Jack teams up. Her role is complicated in turn by the involvement of the undefeated DA, who is her father, thoughtfully played by Richard Jenkins. David Oyelowo is also compelling and weirdly touching as Emerson, the cop in charge of the case. Robert Duvall as Gunny Samuel Cash, is perfect as might be expected<br /><br />I won't go into too much plot detail, so as not to spoil anything, but this film is deeply true to the novel on which it is based, Lee Child's best-selling \\"One Shot.\\" (That may be because Child consulted on the film, which certainly didn't hurt, a fact that is itself a tribute to the writer/director Christopher McQuarrie.) Scene after scene feels like the book has simply come to life, and for a reader watching a film, such a feeling is rare. Where there are changes, they are the ones that are clearly demanded by the translation to the screen and also the locale. For example, the slow drawn-out tension of the final scene wouldn't work in a film where expectations are strong for a quick finish in the last 10-15 minutes. The site of the murders, minutely described in the novel, is slightly altered, probably to avoid building a commercial plaza and highway that existed only in Child's mind.<br /><br />This film has the lushness and glamor of a traditional noir novel. The decision to let Jack's romance with Helen linger in the twilight of desire, irony, and innuendo contributes to the effect. The script and directing are a model of restraint and intelligence (like many a Reacher novel).<br /><br />My only disappointment is in the truly unimaginative title. I can see why \\"Jack Reacher\\" might seem like the right choice, given the monitory role played by reference to the hero's name in the book (the accused requests Jack's presence by name before anyone else involved in the case knows who he is). But (especially in combination with the book's title \\"One Shot\\") the name of the film gives the impression that this will be the ONLY Reacher film. It's so good that I hope that is not the case.
B00E193TM2|1.0|Another lame attempt by an overrated metal band.  Same format, same lame lyrics.  Nothing but over pretentious cock rock by a band that clearly cashes in on a format made famous by Nickelback.
B00915G6SU|1.0|In calling this the worst show on TV, I'm trying to make a calculation that combines the quality of the show vs. the length of time it has been on the air (and perhaps the length of time it seems likely to continue).  I started watching during the first season, and while it wasn't a great show, it wasn't completely awful.  In particular, the presence of Mandy Patinkin came the show something of a moral center.  However, Mr. Patinkin had the sense to leave the show during the second season, and the program went into a long period of decline.<br /><br />  The worst period was probably during the fourth and fifth seasons, when the show was dominated by very disturbing storylines, often directed at the members of the team itself.  At the very least, this should have brought the team to an end -- all of them were victims of PTS issues, and should have been transferred to other FBI departments.  But, since the show has to go on, Criminal Minds is left with its cast of damaged human beings.  When you combine this with the number of years the show has been in production, things have gotten pretty grim.  The writers are clearly having difficulty coming up with stories that resemble actual law enforcement.  The actors look very tired with what they are doing.  However many times can they utter the psychobabble about the \\"unsub\\" and expect it to mean anything?  One striking feature about the show is the way the team operates with little involvement from local law enforcement, whose knowledge of their own community usually mean they're the ones most likely to solve local crime.<br /><br />  I know crime procedurals on TV are rarely realistic, but Criminal Minds has moved onto a largely imaginary world of bizarre killers and their own set of magical words that allow them to \\"solve\\" crime.  In many ways, the fact that is show has gone on for eight years and remains popular is the most disturbing thing about it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this series.  The actors are outstanding, and the content is uplifting.  It is like taking a mini vacation.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|One of the reasons that iTunes is so popular is the ability to buy singles.  Most artists these days release CD's with one or two solid, catchy singles made for the radio with a lot of fluff in between.  What makes Justin such an amazing artist, in my opinion, is his ability to release complete CD's that are a joy to listen to from beginning to end.  His sound is unique and distinguishable, but the styles of the tracks differ.  There's some slower melodies and some more 'dance-oriented' tracks too.  It's a nice well-rounded effort. Despite having a spotify subscription, I bought this CD (as I'm inclined to do with some of my favorite releases).  If you've only heard the radio singles, do yourself a favor and invest in the complete CD.
1442346949|4.0|Steve is interesting because he was such a creative genius. While listening to this I did learn more about him, but the whole thing also felt like an advertisement for Apple. Overall, a worthwhile purchase.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|Worthless, violent, depressing garbage.  Hated the first 5 minutes and couldn't even watch it. Huge waste of money.  I don't understand why people enjoy this stuff.  I absolutely hated it and wish I could get my money back!  $6 wasted.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's better than the last iteration. I'm having fun with it, which is what I want from these games. Missile Defender is worth the download.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Similar to the old Missile Command game from the old days, but you can upgrade things like your missile speed, blast duration, etc. Very addictive adaptation.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|. will see how hard it get funny game - like it a lot so far. bonus points for the review make it even better
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|you should be able to make your own car but you have to pay with coins to buy the car parts so you can make the ultimate car

B002361MLA|5.0|This book came highly recommended by three different people at three different times. People who have made positive changes in their lives.  With the help and guidance of 'The Power of Now', I too will make changes and learn how to live without the \\"pain body\\" and be present in the now!
B000OLGCI4|4.0|love the story and was able to purchase it for what i consider cheap. under 20$. will keep my eye open for other deals from the seller
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging but not too much. My kids enjoyed playing as much as I did. I really like the fact that you actually have to use your mind to get through the game. The puzzles are fun to complete. It is definitely not a boring game.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very fun game it keeps you guessing and on your toes trying to answer the riddle and helps keep your brain active and alert an extremely fun game
B001P7HUF0|5.0|They don't make movies like this these days.  If you like courtroom drama, you will like this!  Great cast!  Good storyline.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I have never written a review before but I felt obligated to warn others that this is a HUGE waste of time and money. The sample is the best part of this book. How this got such great reviews is beyond me.  It seems so unbelievable. I mean, it's so dull and incredibly boring.
1452101248|5.0|this book is well illustrated and with instructions that are so easy to follow. every dish  turned out and looked just like the photograph. I am usually known for my french and italian cooking and this is a wonderful change of pace. I have recommended this book to many friends. I also bought Jerusalem, and made two dishes from it for a dinner party, one fish and one chicken and my guests raved at the flavors and originality.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very fun game with alot action....<br />Never played it before but i has cought me.. :-)<br />Try it out and you wont be desapointed.
B00846REIS|5.0|the story line was good-great sex dialogue but I kept turning the pages on the entire trilogy to see what happened next-white knuckles for me
1623360277|5.0|So simple, love the explanation of why starch is best to build a meal on and the recipes included are great.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I think the game is really fun. I also think that it is really easy to play. Ocne you get the hang of the game you wont have a problem playing it.
0399242864|5.0|My 2.5 year old loves this book, as do I. It doesn't get old to read. I find the message of having an impossible dream but not giving up very inspirational and important, even if sometimes it means revising your dream along the way. I love Oliver Jeffers books and this one is no exception.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I Love this show, I love the characters and i love their story. I am so drawn in....but start the series with season one. I love Alicia.
1612680011|5.0|This one is definitely worth a read. It's very easy to read and understand, and it makes you reflect on your own ideas and habits. Gives you something to think about.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|rapid paved play the weapons bonus makes for a more interesting play easy and accurate controls make it fun to use multi hit bonus to raise scores all in all this is nice retro feel game in a modern package
B00BW0QC8G|5.0|This bag can carry a standard sized laptop very well as well as an ipad or other tablet device and the pocket is padded nicely to prevent damaging in transit. There is even a nice cell phone pocket in the front that is lined with soft fabric for fragile devices. The backing is extremely padded for extra comfort and there is even a hidden pocket within the back pad for important items like passports or cash. Overall, plenty of room and the bag itself is very light, with a simple design. All the stitching seems durable and high quality. I imagine this bag will last for years to come.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I love it! This game just rock-ets! Lol really, I do love it not hard to get perfects if you upgrade properly though, so keep trucking on...
B0063M22QO|1.0|Downloaded the game and tried to play it, however none of the tiles have any faces on them - - the tiles are blank.<br />If you have any suggestions as to how to fix this (aside from getting a marker and start coloring the blanks,) please feel free to jump right in there and help me out.  If not may I have a refund please?<br />DramaNana
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I really liked the relationship that built over time. Unconditional love - Ana showed Christian what he was missing  and he loved her enough to allow it to consume him.  Book 1& 2 were good, book 3 got to be a bit long.
B008MVPCNE|4.0|Wish the &#34;cranberry&#34; color was a shade darker, but the style these days is bright footwear.  I am a fan of the comfort and utility of Crocs, I wanted to try the sole style of the &#34;Duet&#34; model, they don't disappoint.  This color was half the price of the more popular Navy and White and other standards. So if your not intimidated by the brighter colors they are a real bargain.
B000T433CO|4.0|My mom's business partner let us borrow this movie. I reLly liked it. I liked the actors and actresses. The story was good. It was a happily ever after movie. You should really see it. The movie sweet. I highly recommend this movie
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very adding and very fun. It not to complicated to understand but is very different every time you  play a puzzle. I haven't been able to stop.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|works fine, all disks were good, i don't mind the modded scenes, I think its great to have the series at a great price
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved it, and its really not my favorite genre. I will gladly recommend it! I think it works for everyone!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like it, glad i got one when i did, apparently they are  hard to get, but by the time you get one hopefully they will be fully functional, with all the apps you like. Im waiting for twitch to get on board then ill be all set
B0084670FU|5.0|Three stories, three situations, three diverse cultures, which are connected and related to each other. I highly recommend it. A Must-see.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It Is A Fun Game. I Like It Better Than The Original. It Has Easy Game Play. the Upgrades Are goOd
B0051E9INK|3.0|I am Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. I was born in 1518 in the village of Glenfinnan on the shores of Loch Shiel. And I am immortal.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I decent read, certainly not his best work but entertaining. The shortcomings that I saw was the book fell apart at the end.  It came to a point that it just got into some areas or thoughts which were  unfinished. Perhaps that was intentional to lend itself to a sequel.
B0097RF3X6|5.0|Her voice is sound so sexy! The songs included in the album has been greatly selected and the way she songs is amazing
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This product was shipped on time and the quality is excellent! I could not be happier with the product and would recommend anyone who is looking into purchasing this product to do so without hesitation !
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This is a very moving, provocative story that most of us can relate to on some level:  teen-agers in love for the first time, kids with confidence issues, bad home lives, trouble with peers....the narration is believable, as are the characterizations and the plot structure.  I am a high school English teacher and will definitely recommend this to my students.  I really enjoyed it - not my FAVORITE book of the summer, but it's up there on my list.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|This product was shipped on time and the quality is excellent! I could not be happier with the product and would recommend anyone who is looking into purchasing this product to do so without hesitation !

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This product was shipped on time and the quality is excellent! I could not be happier with the product and would recommend anyone who is looking into purchasing this product to do so without hesitation !
B00BESM14U|2.0|I found this boring in parts, and not very insightful. But then maybe I'm too far past that time in my life. Not my kind of angst.
B00DZVKQGY|1.0|I didn't care for the author's style of writing.  There was not enough conversation from the characters and was mostly describing what happened instead of the characters developing the story line.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game my babybaby introduced this game to me and I don't want to put it down lol love love love
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Need to access more nuts. Fun to play.  Fun to know other players, and find out how others play game and decorate there village.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Reminds me of game I played as a kid<br />A lot of fun<br />Simple yet fun<br />Everyone should play.  Gamer choice four stars
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I enjoyed the book as much as I enjoy the TV series.  Great characters , good mystery and entertaining storytelling!
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|If you liked Kick Ass you most likely will like 2.  KA2 is a sequel so not as good as the first, but pretty close. Hit Girl isn't the cute foul mouthed little girl anymore.  She is 15 and dealing with high school and feelings.  She is still an awesome butt kicker and is a great character.  Kick Ass is bigger and a bit tougher.  The movie still has all the violence, crude humor and foul mouth stuff that the original had. Funny and action all in this movie.  Stay after the credits and one bonus for me was in the previews where we saw the Bad Grandpa trailer which was funny especially the beauty pageant part.  I was nearly crying.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about good, funny and interesting things in the real world.  Anyone who thinks this  could never happen to them is wrong
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It's so repetitious that by the time you're on the 3rd book, you're bored.  Just plowed through it because I always finish a book.<br />Also very far-fetched re: business.
9056912445|5.0|Curiously for me the author mentions having made his first study of rook endings with Smyslov and Levenfish, which is a less than happy memory (dating back in my case to about 1965!) I share with him. As I am a glutton for endgame books, I have every worthwhile text written in the last 80 years in either English or German. It never made me an authority on the ending, but books about them are another matter!<br />This is far and away the best endgame book I have ever come across - at least for a player of a certain strength. I suppose international masters would not look at it; but below that grade it is an ideal companion to your competitive struggles. It delivers what every other book only promises - full explanatory text that fosters an understanding; and understanding eases memorisation. I think the author has hit the nail on the head with giving recognition to this under-estimated aspect of study. Contrasting it with another \\"100 endings\\" book, the one written by John Nunn, this one scores higher in this respect. Nunn is a glutton for analysis; but I venture to say that analysis is perfectly useless if you cannot marshal an input of ideas! Analysis promotes the illusion that if only you work hard enough, you'll find a way. Wrong tack! That might have done for Tarrasch and his cronies, who believed fervently in the \\"best move\\" concept and were thoroughly debunked by Lasker. Ideas and understanding are the short-cuts to finding not only the best (if there is one), but the most effective move; and this applies to the ending as much as to the middle game.<br />This is best illustrated in this book in the discussion of K+B+N vs K. I remember reading Tarrasch and memorising his \\"W\\" manoeuvre once the King is on the back rank. Villa does him one better by showing graphically how B+N can build the blockade to drive the K back from a random position of the pieces on the board. Once seen, it is imprinted on your mind and you can forget about analysis. That's how explanations should work. I note, en passant, that neither Averbakh, nor Muller-Lamprecht, nor Nunn or indeed most other writings on this ending made it so simple.<br />Only one, very minor, quibble. Why does it have to be 100 ideas? This is the same silly notion that Nunn put forth in several of his books. I realise it makes for catchy book title. But other than this artifice, the book is a superb teaching and self-teaching manual. It deserves the highest accolades and no-one who studies it, could possibly fail to improve their endgame play - and most importantly, cultivate a good memory of the salient aspect of these endings.
B00A285OOW|5.0|What can I say? It's a historical  novel from Philipa Gregory and about the Houses of York and Lancaster and the long cousin's war in England. It's full of history, romance, political struggles, and suspense. Loved it! Watching the series made of this and the Red Queen on TV already.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun and easy to play. Just like old school Missle Command from the early 80s! And sense it was the free app of the day, it makes it even better!
B003477DVK|4.0|I had seen this movie years ago and, as a dog lover, I enjoyed it.  Without turning in my man card, I will admit to getting a little misty eyed but, then again, Hallmark commercials on TV get to me, as well.  Queued it up again when a grandson and granddaughter were over and geeeeez, it made for such an enjoyable, shared moment.  I loved watching them watch the movie.  Frankie Muniz has always been one of the better child actors and he demonstrates this here in one of his earliest roles.  Bacon as the father is a bit over the top, but I think the director was going for that &#34;as seen through the eyes of the child&#34; deal.  One of the best things about having little guys around is you've got a built in excuse to watch movies you might overlook on your own.  Don't miss this one.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|Okay, I'm going to dust the cobwebs off this 1992 comic musical and encourage you to watch Scott Hastings do his \\"crowd-pleasing steps!\\" then thrill to the sound of one lone pair of trembling hands as it claps in that echoing ballroom. Goosebumps every time!<br /><br />Australian Baz Luhrmann (\\"Australia\\") launched his Red Curtain Trilogy with this sweet, goofy, romantic, cartoon of a musical. The other two in this trio are \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (1996) and \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" (2001). All three are conceived and developed with only one thing in mind: The Audience. And that's US!<br /><br />These wonderful actors make it happen:<br />  * Paul Mercurio (\\"Joseph\\") is Scott Hastings, son of the proprietors of a struggling ballroom dance studio. His father is a hen-pecked sad sack, while his mother is an ambitious spark plug. They both agree that \\"this is Scott's year to win the Australian Pan Pacific Championships\\" and bring glory to their studio.<br />  * Barry Otto (\\"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\\") is Scott's father, quietly melting into the woodwork, as his wife runs the show.<br />  * Pat Thomson (\\"Phar Lap\\") is fearless as Shirley Hastings, Scott's mother who is tone deaf to everything but her own ambition. I'm sorry to say that she died the same year this film was completed and we lost a fine actress.<br />  * Tara Morice (\\"Razzle Dazzle\\") is Fran, the poor student stuck in Beginners, who has aspirations... She does janitorial work to pay for her lessons. It is Scott who asks her, \\"Do you think you could dance without those glasses?\\" (I LOVE clichés!)<br />  * Bill Hunter (\\"Finding Nemo\\") is Barry Fife, who disqualifies Scott for not using Federation-approved dance steps. Hunter, who died in 2011, was part of Australia's acting aristocracy.<br /><br />As you can tell, the plot swirls around an upcoming Ballroom dance contest, with Scott in a frantic search for a new dance partner, as his has been stolen away by the reigning champ. Fran wants to audition,but she's a Beginner!<br /><br />Be prepared to completely buy into this plot, root for the good guys, hiss at the bad ones, watch Fran's father do an amazing Paso Doble with his mother-in-law (Fran's grandmother), and thrill to some spectacular ball- room dancing with stunning costumes. (Luhrmann's parents danced in Ballroom competitions, so he knows whereof he speaks.)<br /><br />I've owned this DVD for years and it's almost worn out.... I may need a new one from Amazon.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This game is alot of fun but it keeps zero'ing out my weekly points which sucks all the fun out.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Our hero is not happened instantly but gradually, after years and years of suffering since the childhood, he came out in the form of charsles bukowski.<br /><br />reading this book will enlighten his childhood > early age of sufferings and his wondrous simple and realistic viewpoint.<br /><br />if i were you, i would have started to read this first. it would be a concrete reference for the future readings of bukowski<br /><br />have good readings<br />Ozan
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Worth the watch<br />Great characters and story line<br />Keeps you involved and engaged through out the entire movie<br />Surprise ending
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun, interesting,  and challenging game.  like the different puzzles and rooms. keeps you thinking and wanting more.
B0044C5SCU|3.0|Excellent show! This season frustrated me. WTF with the new original dimension. It grows on you but it takes time to grow.
B00846REIS|5.0|You will want to read all three books and will have a hard time putting them down.  I cant wait for a fourth book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|A new skin for a classic game. I had &quot;missle command&quot; on my PC long ago and this actually tops it
B005EGXNLS|4.0|I have read all the books in this series and this one is an excellent next sequence.  Cornwall is an excellent story teller and I enjoyed the story.
B00E63OMEM|5.0|I loved this book! Its funny and it actually explains a lot... All adventure time fans should buy this book!!! Rite now, what are you waiting for?!?!?!
B0087GF8ZG|2.0|I ordered this light for a walk thru storage area in our home. While not as bright as I expected it is adequate --- well sort of. The motion detector works fine --- well sort of. You need to be within about 10 feet to activate it. So, since the room is 25 feet long with a door at each end I'd need one at each end of the room for adequate coverage.  If you do purchase one of these lights, whatever you do, don't rely on the Velcro provided to hold the light to the wall.  Does the Velcro work --- well sort of.  I don't know what type of adhesive is on the Velcro but it held the light in place for about two minutes before it crashed to the floor.  Use the screws provided to fasten the light to the wall.  Over all, I'm disappointed with this product --- well sort of!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman sets up a normal boy's life but it's not that normal and there's a tear in the boy's reality that threatens to take down all of life as he knows it. In one of his more serious novels, Gaiman manages to create a world whose stability depends on the powers of children to keep it together. A quick read and a sometimes scary one.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|after today 8/23/13 update the app now just crashes on kindle fire. my daughter game is now lost. thanks for nothing
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is easy to use and I love the display feature flexibility.  This is the best alarm app I've used.
B000002MY3|5.0|I rebought it losing it years ago and it is just like I remember.Every song is great and she is so talented. Normally not my kind of music, but she rocks.
1481130331|5.0|History can either slow a book or enrich it. Christoph Fischer found the secret formula. This historical novel blends the right bit of romance, slice-of-life reality and historic facts to paint a story that is difficult to put down and impossible to let go of. The characters are all people I know, who I can never forget. Their drama and survival during the most horrendous period of the last century is crafted with such care and perfect detail that you might believe it is a story of your own family. The Luck of the Weissensteiners is one of those rare books that not only tackles topics such as trust and betrayal, but also gives you fresh perspective into the depths of those topics. Two families, one Catholic and one Jewish, cross the WWII era with all the tension and trouble that that imagines, yet out of the sadness and shame we are left with hope and a belief in luck. This wonderful book is highly recommended.
B008220BP2|4.0|A different kind of zombie love story. There are lots of funny parts and the characters are likeable and developed quickly.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Lots of fun for us older ones that played this year's ago even better e r when free<br />Good came a n fun from the old days
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|After hearing so much about how amazing 'Downton Abbey' is, I decided to see what all the fuss was about.  So, I watched the first episode.  Then, the next.  Until finally, I watched all of season one in just 3 days.  Yep, it's addicting and here's why:<br /><br />I consider Downton Abbey one of the best television series to date.  It's a refreshing storyline to watch as it explores an era that has barely been seen in an entire TV series. We are introduced to many fictional characters who take us through a nonfictional world. The historical timeline of events that are brought up in the series gives us a new look into what life was like back when the telephone became a greater deal, when women began discovering the right to have choices, and when World War I created a transition into a different and unsettling world.<br /><br />The writers also do a fantastic job in revealing the perfect amount of back story and depth to each character and I absolutely love that we have the chance to get attached to characters from various backgrounds.  I also think that this show could not have been casted any better.  There is an exceptional range of talented actors and actresses that do an incredible job developing their characters throughout the series.<br /><br />If you haven't watched 'Downton Abbey' yet, then I hope my review has convinced you to see what all of the necessary excitement over this show is all about.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I expected it to work like it does on my computer (I have a Kindle) and it doesn't - I couldn't figure how to search with it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|easy to download and works just like on the kindle. and you get up to 10 devices. I have 8 more. more than enough.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It freezes way to often and the (htg's) hard to get items are way too hard to get!! Other than that the game is great!!
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|I've been playing a lot of point and click games.  This had a slow start but it moved along a nd was very entertaining.  The clues are good and none of the games are difficult.  If u r stuck on something it just means u haven't found the correct clue because it really will be staring u in the face..  Have fun
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is an awsome app i have the 3rd update and i love it i recamind this app for 5-22

B0094BB4TW|4.0|Update!!! This app is not the latest version of Facebook  and at the top of my newsfeed it says upgrade Facebook but it takes u to the google play store please update
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's an alarm clock. I set it. It will play a canned tune or (and this is what I like) a song from my own library.<br />Zac Brown Band as a reminder for something... James Brown as a wakeup call.<br /><br />It works for me.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|So very entertaining.... Addiction is an understatement, can't seem to put it down once you pick it up.... So well WORTH the money!!!!!  So I would highly recommend this one!!!!!!!! Would give it a higher rating than 5 if I could.......  :-)
B00COHAUD4|1.0|It left a feeling of a cheap Movie, got it from red box, and it is not worth money I paid for it.
0316228583|2.0|Much like her new book, published under the fake alleged SAS agent turned author Galbraith; this book is a little boring and filled with prose that just elucidates useless details that have no take on the matter at hand, and although this is treasured in Harry Potter, which is a fantasy rich with details that we are unaware of and hence love to read about...Rowling's venture into other genres seem forced and unnatural: her characters seem real but not really, you can never shake the feeling that the whole thing is fictional, that things happen as they're supposed to happen, with very little elements of surprise or thrill. Plot use elements of chaos and randomization to get characters into, and out of tough situations, and although the former is obliged, the latter feels like cheating.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I keep opening the app, and it says it needs to update it... But fails to update... I've tried with and without Wi-Fi and nothing works
B004SBULWE|1.0|Never never!!<br />I was installed this app, and my kindle were slow down.<br />I didn't see this app ever. So what I talking to yours is<br />DO NOT USE THIS APP ON KINDLE FIRE HD 7&quot;<br />It like a gum on the road. Make me shit.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this has been fun. waiting for more levels to figure out. got my sons hooked on it. keep the levels coming!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|There is always room for improvement but this is a great product. Having access to more viewing options will only enhance its value.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game of Bingo. I play it on my kindle and my phone and both me and my daughter gift prizes to each other. It's great and quite addictive.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I'm really enjoying watching these! Richard Dean Anderson looks so young! The plots are still good even though some things are outdated -- big car phones and a divided Berlin for examples -- but they are still enjoyable to watch.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Pretty addicting starts pretty easy gets challenging. Just wish there were more upgrades or different levels. Best game I've come across on the kindle
0307476073|1.0|Something was missing from this book and I can't quite put my finger on it.  Some of the others who gave this one star said it all, already.  The author had me in the beginning, but I didn't think her hike helped her to grow in any way.  I got bored with her complaining and didnt really like her as a person. I am grateful for the description of the trail.  I had never heard of it before and might consider hiking a section one day.  I would definitely break in the boots first!
1849386684|5.0|While I am just getting started in this book I have found it very helpful learning my first three cords. I look forward to working through it as the instructions are clear and easy to follow.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A young adult fantasy along the lines of Harry Potter in that a young, alienated boy discovers his true nature and true family. A quest, bad creatures, a little romance and there you have it-a good yarn for a lazy afternoon. I think it's also an appropriate bedtime story for older kids.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I really enjoy the fact that i have this series in my collection now.  I love the writing and i can always go back and see what i missed the first time i saw it.  Thank you for the prompt delivery.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Now that I'm learning how to use  and play the game, I'm enjoying it a lot.  I still need to figure some things out though.
B000K3HTRY|5.0|My better half loves this movie and i bought it for us to watch.  Not only is she a fan but i am also now a fan of this movie.  Thank you for letting us be able to watch it from our computer at home as well as my kindle fire.
B006TLFIAQ|4.0|Well acted by De Nero and Stratham.  At times plot is a bit too fast to fully appreciate.  Much physical action.<br />Strongly recommended for De Nero and action aficionados.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and enjoy playing it over and over again. I love having my bff's little sister and niece fight with me to play it.
B002722R64|5.0|This is the Bond I remember growing up so in my mind The Best Bond... Movie was brilliantly directed and played very well by Pierce... 5 stars!!!!!
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|My fiance and i are addicted to this game and we cant put it down.  We have actually had it tell us when our lives are back and we can play again.  Thank you to who ever created this game but omg why did you have to make it so hard for some and easy for other ones! lol
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like the looks of the clocks on this app. Lots of cool features like Weather, Alarm clock, Timer and more.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I have watched it over and over again.  There is so much i have missed and each time i see it i see something new.  Thank you!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I have similar comments as many others, it is still interesting reading but starting to get boring.  How many times can Tyrion cheat death?  What is with Bran?  This will probably be my last purchase of the series unless the next book is a conclusion.<br /><br />It reminds me very much of the Dune series from several years ago in that it just started to be so dragged out that it was not enjoyable any more.  Martin seems to enjoy writing certain things over and over.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Nice way to pass the time.<br />Explosive duration and radius are good thins to upgrade early on in the game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Enjoyed.playing.the game quite a bit. Will definitely be stealing some of.my.free.time. Takes a while to get repair/upgrade points but.not.too.long.that it's.frustrating.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Simple and intuitive touch-screen update to Missile Command. Difficulty curve makes sense so far, and all in all it's a fun app to while away a few minutes here and there.
B00004D369|4.0|It's simply a good movie with lots of other-worldly experiences.<br />You won't want to miss a thing in this one!
B005544V6A|5.0|Cool show, Harvey is the most intriguing character on TV right now.  This is another very well written USA network show.  Highly recommended.
B007C3TVNA|4.0|This is a good look into what it is often like to love & raise a child who lacks a conscience... due to a genetic flaw.  It's a bit, &#34;artsy&#34; which I liked and the mother is weak & for the most part, unable & unprepared to deal with a child-psychopath.  But then, who is???  There's no handbook for child-raising and there certainly is not any kind of handbook nor help for the most part in knowing how to raise a child like this.  But sadly... many parents have and do, daily.<br /><br />I liked that the storyline includes how it was mostly the mother's place, (in the movie as it is sadly still expected... in society) to love & raise a very smart, intelligent & deviant child without the help of her husband, (for the most part) her community nor anyone else.  It showed how the community basically, &#34;shunned&#34; her and worse... after she did what she could for him, but he decided to take out his angst & simply sick lack of empathy for others.  They were no where to be found while she was raising him but certainly were ready to hate her after her son's murder of other children.<br /><br />I think this movie could have gone into more depth & development of the storyline.  But it did get the point across!<br />I hope anyone dealing with this type of child can watch this movie and relate to her desperation and somehow find help.  I also hope that for those who have often criticized other parents, (usually mothers) for having children like Kevin or thinking that it was somehow the mother's fault... will watch this and get a tiny taste of just how horrifying & devastating it is for her and choose to not judge them in a negative light anymore.  If that's all that comes out of this movie... it's a good thing!
B000Y7U98W|5.0|I usually don't like space movies, but this one is well done.  It beats a lot of mega-budget movies hands down.  Good job with character development.  I highly recommend a larger TV with surround sound if possible, just to make a great movie even better!
B006OV7RQ4|4.0|A good story & also a good warning to any who might be persuaded by those with ill intent.  Should serve to warn vulnerable teens and young adults who to not get involved with.
B00005LK94|5.0|I was able to see the last part of this movie on TV and I wanted to see it entirely.  This is a great movie and very meaningful.
