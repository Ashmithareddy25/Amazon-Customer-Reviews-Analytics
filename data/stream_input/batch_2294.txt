B0068LYEHA|2.0|A CPL book club choice, I probably would not have selected this book otherwise. It opened a bit predictably (with periods). And though I am a woman, Moran's description of her first period was certainly horrific. As the essays progressed to other \\"womanly\\" topics (breasts, masturbation, discrimination, porn, strip clubs, pregnancy, abortion), I never was able to identify with Moran's experiences of womanhood. The only thing we have in common was her descriptions of her 13-year-old self's love of books. There were a lot of pop culture references - some more familiar than other. The endorsements mentioned how funny this was, but nothing about it made me laugh. I smiled a few times, but never actually laughed - or felt the need to share any sections. I never strongly agreed with any of Moran's points, but didn't disagree with enough force for this to be an engaging read. By the end, my interest had completely waned and I skimmed the last few chapters. I just couldn't connect with this at all.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Although I haven't read any of the popular  vampire stories I think this is &#34;the Classic&#34; vampire story because of the stylistic writing and detail of the settings. Rarely in modern literature, at least in my untrained and humble opinion, do you find the pure and vibrant descriptions of the various settings and characters. The carriage rides to Dracula's Castle in the mountains of Romania, the local denizens, the inner thoughts of the characters are so richly described that I want to go to those places and meet most of the characters to experience the sights and sounds for myself. The ensuing chapters, written in diary form by the characters, rather than  tortuous to read as books written in play form can be flows easily. If you are looking for a fast, shallow, embellished read this isn't for you.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Very basic game, similar to early additions of Mario Bros.  My kids seemed to be entertained by it though.  However, after a relatively short period of time they stopped playing it to move on to the more challenging games.  Might be fun for younger children.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I have not received this yet but am looking forward to it. The entire series purpose in addition to entertaining was to make the viewer think. No matter how many times you watch any episode of the show you notice something different or think of something differently. This season is no different.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I very much like all the actors in this movie, but i dont like them IN this movie,  with a little different casting and maybee a bit better directing this movie would have had some potential. This is what happens when you simple cast who's \\"HOT\\" in hollywood in your movie.. Thor, and Bella...  not in this movie.
048623231X|4.0|Though they can also be appreciated on their own by the casual viewer, Dore's illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy are a great aid while reading Dante's Divine Comedy. And, in turn, reading Dante's poem heightens one's appreciation of the illustrations. In his translation of Purgatory, John Ciardi cautions readers \\"to visualize Dante's scenes in terms of Dante's own details rather than in terms of Dore's romantic misconceptions.\\" (Ciardi note to Canto xiii, l. 61-66.) I think Ciardi's criticism is overdone. Dore's illustrations sometimes vary from the text of the Divine Comedy, for example, in canto viii of the Inferno the walls of the city of Dis are surmounted by the minarets of Islam, but Dore omits that detail. That and other variances, however, can, where noticed, also precipitate a reader's insight.<br /><br />Dore's illustrations depict the scenes in the Inferno best, they're worthwhile for depicting Purgatory, but -- though some have raved about the depictions of Paradise -- were of little value to me while I read Paradise. Perhaps Dore thought so too: the greatest number of the illustrations depict hell, fewer depict Purgatory, and the fewest heaven. Some of the illustrations are masterpieces, including the depictions of Paolo and Francesca (including that of their assassination) and that of Bertram de Born, which is on the cover of the book.<br /><br />In the back and white woodcuts, the darkness of hell lightens in purgatory and washes out even more in heaven. The scenes in hell seem the most \\"fun\\" as souls suffer their often gruesome eternal punishments. In an ironic twist, the \\"bodies\\" of those in hell seem the most muscular and robust. The black and white illustrations sometimes suffer where Dante uses color to make a theological point (there is no color in Dante's hell, though). For example, in canto ix of Purgatory, Dante has three colored steps lead up to the gate of purgatory. The colors have theological significance, which is lost to one only viewing the illustrations.<br /><br />The extremely reasonable price of this volume suggests that anyone with a passing interest in Dante or Catholicism or art and culture should own a copy.iewing the illustrations.<br /><br />The extremely reasonable price of this volume suggests that anyone with a passing interest in Dante or Catholicism or art and culture should own a copy.

0140439129|5.0|Quotes such as this, to me, are worth Darwin's place in posterity: \\"How unconsciously many habitual actions are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits easily become associated with other habits, and with certain periods of time and states of the body. When once acquired, they often remain constant throughout life.\\" To me, that's insightful, and it's also encouraging and frightening.<br /><br />It's frightening because it implies once we reach a certain point, we're stuck. Seneca said something similar, but related being stuck to old age. Darwin is suggesting it's not just age, but rather the accumulation and reenforcement of lazy or wrong habits over time. When he says \\"indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will,\\" he's saying we continue with bad habits despite knowing they're bad. Yes, yes, I know I should exercise, but I really like plopping down on the sofa after work.<br /><br />Of course, the reverse is true as well. There are some interesting things being done in behavioral psychology that show humans act differently in different situations and environments, and also that we can be coaxed and incentivized. That shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. Most people are more relaxed hanging with friends than being grilled by their boss, and also respond better to praise than anger. Understanding the precursors of behavior and how we develop habit are important. If habit can get us stuck in life, perhaps it can get us unstuck as well.<br /><br />And it's here that I tend to see some Darwinists as just as rude and judgmental as some religious fanatics. In the same chapter, Darwin writes, \\"But I believe that the effects of habit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be called accidental variations of instincts....\\" This quote, unfortunately, gets used as evidence to say a person cannot do something. You'll never be adoctor, because you just don't have it in you, they say. Or, if a teenager is doing drugs or cutting, the behavior is attributed to a genetic cause instead of a social one.<br /><br />That bothers. It bothers me because it's used to hold people back. Nowhere does Darwin say humans cannot do something related to effort and work. The quote is taken out of context, and unfinished. The rest of the sentence goes, \\"... that is of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of bodily structure.\\" Indeed, this book is about animals (though purposefully implies humans), and what he's saying, to modernize it, is: The honey bee is the honey bee, because that's what honey bees are.<br /><br />Humans, however, are humans. Through evolution or not, we can differentiate ourselves in many more ways than most animals. Kangaroos are kangaroos. Pandas are pandas. But we can be doctors and lawyers and writers and public speakers and CEOs and friends and the presidents of countries. Certainly, genetics plays a role in a lot of things, but it's not the only factor that shapes us. Unlike other animals, if we want to do something--if we want to make it in Hollywood, for instance--all we have to do is try, and try, and try, and keep trying, until doing so becomes habit.<br /><br />(Homo sapiens, incidentally, is Latin for the wise one.)

B00AQ2KLEM|4.0|This album contains all the elements I expected, and I got what I bought. However, there are certainly flaws. Most notably the fact that 'Titanium' and the song they performed at the rave are not included. Also (But not surprisingly) none of Becca's remixes were included and in my own humble opinion they were perfect. If you need a short dose of pitch slap. This is a perfect album for you. I personally recommend the special edition as it includes my favorite song in the entire movie 'F You'.<br /><br />1.Don't Stop the Music- One of the catchiest songs (As it was on the radio when Rihanna did it) and from the first scene it's an album standout.<br />2.Let it Whip- Another song by the Treblemakers performed on campus as they were trying to gain new recruits. If you didn't like it in the movie, you won't like it here. It's old soul in without the soul. Not my favorite.<br />3.Since You Been Gone- Sadly not the hot mess of the auditions, but the cleaned up version featuring the Black Beauty and Skylar Astin. Still catchy as all get out.<br />4.Cups- I didn't know how I felt about this song from Becca's auditions, but I think it's charming now.<br />5.Riff Off- An eclectic array of Madonna, Pat Benatar, and a list of chart toppers it's like the movie certainly not a normal way of mashing songs. One thing to note is that Becca's `No Diggity' is given additional backing vocals to make up for her awkward intro.<br />6.Bellas Regionals- Loved it in the movie and one of the songs I play the most. There's nothing different about it, although Rebel Wilson's voice is heard through out and makes me quite happy.<br />7.Right Round- A great cover of Flo Rida's hit. It's quite catchy.<br />8.Pool Mashup- This is the only way I can stand to listen to these two songs (Bruno Mar's Just the Way You Are and Just a Dream) whoever did this arrangement did an amazing job at it.<br />9.Party in the U.S.A.- If you don't like Miley Cyrus's version it's doubtful you'll like this version, luckily it's barely a minute long.<br />10.Trebles Finals- It's not bad, but compared to Cee Lo Green's soulful vocals on `Bright Lights, Bigger City' it hardly stands up. Once, it gets into Magic, however it really picks up and is quite nice.<br />11.Bellas Finals- I couldn't begin to pick all the songs they put into this mashup, but I like it. If it is a little excessive at times.<br />12.Toner- Sadly this is not one of Becca's remixes as I thought when I started listening to it. It is instead just instrumentals from the movie. Not quite sure why it's on here.<br />13.F*** You- Not the Cee Lo Green song, but instead one by the Sockapellas it's eclectic bashing to racists and over all bring me downs. It's important to know this song does not swear or is explicit in anyway despite its name.<br />14.Blame It on the Boogie- You might remember the soulful group that beat out the Bellas in the Semi Regionals, well this is there song. I can't stand the lead singers voice, so not a song I play. However, most people like it and thankfully it is a under a minute.<br />15.The Final Countdown- A song by the Hullabahoos I don't remember any individual group performing it, but I remember the songs usage in the movie. It's a great adaptation, it makes me sad that it's barely over a minute.<br />16.Open Season- A song with instrumental backing by the High Highs (Not the High Notes) it's an actual song with vocals and pianos. It's nice and I vaguely recall it's use in the movie, and I'm not quite sure why it's included on the soundtrack. However that doesn't stop it from being an incredible, nice, and wonderful song. I'm glad they included it.

I remember listening to his remixes on Youtube only to have the original artists take down his remixes due to copyright infringements. Now he's gone Platinum Rock Star status. Well, I gave the album a shot and fell in love with it. I'm a cyclist and I need good music to keep me pedaling up mountains. Bangarang is frequently on my iPhone when I'm out on the trails or climbing the mountain with a road bike.

1451627297|1.0|This has got to be the biggest let down in my life as far as a Book is concerned.<br /><br />I read this book with hopes of reading a book by Stephen King that didn't have demons and made sense at the end. I WAS WRONG. While it drew you in and to be in honest held it's weight for a long time ...till about page 700 ( or there about) and turns into a pile of nonsense. There is no reason for any of the ending to occur and really seems that he forget where he was going.  It was a waste of time, if you do have it... give it to someone you hate and ask them regularly where they are in the book and take joy in their forth coming disappointment.

B002VECM4K|5.0|This movie closely follows the book (for those who dislike movies that stray from the original story) and adds a visual environment to the intense narrative.  Precious' mother played by Mo'Nique is a frightening (and frightened) woman, and her Golden Globe award was well-deserved.  Precious inspires and uplifts as she learns to grow beyond her sad home life.  Read the book &#34;Push&#34; for more insight into Precious' thoughts about the events she lives through--it's worth the read!

B009P0U7H2|5.0|Let's be realistic, particle physics is never going to be an easy topic. However this book gives a great overview to the topic and the (successful?) search for the Higgs boson. For the first time I came out of reading a book on the topic feeling I had a reasonable understanding of what particle physics is about and could have an intelligent discussion on the topic. It also does a reasonable job on showing why the huge amounts of money have been spent in the field without coming across too arrogantly, a regular failing of those writing in this field (\\"it is important but to difficult for you understand, just believe us\\").  Will you come out of this read at the other end a particle physicist, of course not. It is however a worthwhile (if occasional heavy) effort for those with any interest in the topic.

B003M696QS|3.0|The topic of this book is fascinating, but the presentation leaves something to be desired. I would have preferred more case histories. The many tables become tedious, and would be more appropriate in a scholarly paper than in a popular book. As a physicist, I found the chapter on quantum physics to be muddled and replete with misapprehensions. All in all, the book is worth reading but could have been better.

B00A83075M|5.0|The Disney Animated Classic, the most coveted of labels for an Animated feature film. The Hall of Fame consists of names like Pinocchio, Cinderella & The Little Mermaid. After a few years of rises and falls Disney brings us a new kind of classic film. One that focus more on originality as opposed to story book. With a years behind since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs there a whole new generation of source material to shape a Disney film on and in its' 52nd Animated Feature Disney tackles the world of Video Games with 'Wreck-It Ralph'.<br /><br />This movie is just fantastic filled with amazing visuals unforgettable characters and a trip down memory lane with an army of characters past generations adored. How Disney managed to get the rights to all these familiar video game characters...it's not impossible that's for sure. Still, for a movie such as this breaking the whole fairy tale and old school Disney Classic ways, it was a major triumph. If you don't like video games you may not care for the humor, but Wreck-It Ralph still has the wonder and magic that all the Disney films before it have. To me this could very well be the best Disney (non-Pixar) film. Now, with this film apparently the first in a line of future original Disney film stories I am eager to see what's next. Also, as a Disney fan, it feels great wanting to go back to the theaters and see Disney Classics again, it has been a while.

B0095P29EG|4.0|Thor wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, but it was entertaining. It was a good movie for a snowy Saturday afternoon. I would watch again.
B00BU2SIW4|5.0|As with most likely millions of others around the world, \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" was one of my first musical introductions to the group. I had to be around 9-10 years old when I first saw the music video to \\"Enjoy The Silence\\" on what was either  MTV or VH1 (I admit that I forgot which one). Fast forward years later (around 2002), and my then boyfriend (who is luckily now my current husband) re-introduces me to Depeche Mode through the Exciter cd. Back in January 2005, my husband also purchased the Singles 86>98 collection for me as a gift to celebrate our first wedding anniversary.<br />As a result, I am familiar with Depeche Mode and was eager to hear the new songs from \\"Delta Machine\\", especially after getting a chance to listen to \\"Heaven.\\"  \\"Welcome To My World\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Secret To The End\\", \\"Should Be Higher\\", \\"Soothe My Soul\\",  and \\"Always\\" are some of the other candid and compelling music tracks on this cd. The other strong feature to this collection is the balance of various music elements with the range of songs.  \\"Delta Machine\\" by Depeche Mode is good for those who like electronica music.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I like watching Tom get his butt kicked at the end! I also like the other choices in cast - sucked that Ving was only in it for a little bit.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Was not expecting what I got. This book is hot and erotic! Very new experience for me. E L James took me to a place I only imagined and satisfied some curiosities. Can't wait to read the second book.

B00BS4QP60|5.0|I confess that I was initially introduced to Blake Shelton's music during the summer of 2011. I had heard his \\"Honey Bee\\" song from the Now 39 compilation (which I reviewed on August 24, 2011) and a fun concert of his that I attended back in February 2012.  I had also decided to give the \\"Based On A True Story\\" a chance because of his Red River Blue cd (which is pretty good).  \\"God Gave Me You\\", one of his songs from \\"Red River Blue\\" is both an uplifting song and has a music video available online that symbolizes the great love that Blake Shelton and his wife Miranda Lambert have for each other. However, I am also somewhat familiar with multiple 80's/90's songs from the country music genre because my late adoptive mother and older sister both enjoyed and listened to country music frequently as I was growing up. Additionally, I was initially exposed to country music in my early childhood due to the fact that my maternal grandmother also listened to country music. \\"Based On A True Story\\" is even better than \\"Red River Blue\\" and contains among the following intense songs: Boys Round Here (feat. Pistol Annies & Friends), \\"Sure Be Cool If You Did\\", \\"Do You Remember\\", \\"Country On The Radio\\", \\"Doin What She Likes\\", \\"My Eyes\\" (feat. Gwen Sebastian),\\"Mine Would Be You\\", and \\"Ten Times Crazier.\\" It is only a wild guess, but it appears that some of the happy love songs from \\"Based On A True Story\\" are a positive tribute to his wife Miranda Lambert.  \\"Based On A True Story\\" by Blake Shelton is good for those who are open to listening to modern country music with songs that cover the various facets of love and living life.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book has a way of flowing so that you've been reading for hours and the book is almost finished but you feel like it has only been a few minutes. John Green has a way of making me view life in a whole different way with every book he writes.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Love this album...have been listening to it nonstop! Definitely worth the buy. Mirrors, Pusher Love Girl, and Tunnel Vision are my favorites, but they're all quite good.
B005IFWXWU|4.0|I got this CD after hearing a few of his songs at a blues dance workshop.  I realize that most of the people interested in this CD are probably not actively thinking about dancing with the music, but it is certainly good for that.<br /><br />That being said, this CD has, overall, good, quality music and it is a great listen.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have tried many keyboards but SwiftKey is by far the easiest to type on . it's constantly updated to improve functionality as well. Can't imagine going back to any other keyboard.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|This album is great, the tracks that stand out are &#34;The Ocean&#34;, &#34;Black Dog&#34;, and my favorite track,&#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34;.  There are other tracks I didn't care about so that's why it's lost a star.<br />Overall, if u LOVE zeppelin, pick this up!!!!
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|This is a great movie.  Still so true - even in today's world. Everyone needs to see this one - again and again
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This is an amazing album that I cannot stop listening too.  I saw them sing &#34;Hold On&#34; during an episode of Saturday Night Live, and started to research this group.  Within a couple of days, I found the CD on Amazon and purchsed it and immediately downloaded the MP3 version (thank you for providing that for FREE, Amazon).  This is a great group and if you liked the SNL performance, then you will love this CD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|GOOD READ! It's a quick read and kept me entertained. Definitely worth the buy!  Hopefully the movie is decent too.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Fantastic read! Saw the YouTube videos of these men after reading the book and couldn't help but shed a few tears.
B00164GDD2|4.0|This was my first time buying and watching Ghostbusters and overall, the movie IS awesome!!!!  My only complaint is that the Blu-ray exclusive felt anti-climactic.  I like Slimer Mode but unfortunately, the interviews distract from the movie so if u wanna watch the movie, u gotta go back to the Main Menu.<br />Overall, it's a good Blu-ray so it's well worth the 10 bucks.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I adored the story and laughed throughout. It was such an unlikely love story that I couldn't put down. Love!

B007THA4FI|5.0|I like JK Rowling's story-telling style very much.  She builds the characters very thoroughly.  The book is definitely not peaceful reading.  A complex weaving of lives and problems.  Well Done!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved this book!  Although sad at times, there was always an air of hope.  Reminiscent of &#34;Silver Lining Playbook&#34; with characters who deal with their challenges in their unique off-beat ways.

B000YJ54DU|3.0|This review will contain some minor spoilers<br /><br />Ever since I started reading the Reacher novels I have been looking forward to Nothing To Lose. The idea of Reacher going into a small town, named Despair, and being forced out immediately as a vagrant made me feel like we were going to see Child do a kind of First Blood homage. Reacher as Rambo and going up against a small corrupt force inside the town. Add in that the entire town is run by a local evangelist, named Thurman I believe, who also is the owner of the town's steel mill that employs every adult citizen in town made it even more compelling. Reacher goes up against small town corruption and religious fanaticism. It sounded like a great premise.<br /><br />Unfortunately the novel takes what was great about it and strays too far from it. The religious fanaticism is only a small part of the book when I feel like it should have been the most important part of the story. It only becomes important in the books final chapters. Instead most of the story is spent on investigating the steel mill as well as a mystery involving men who go missing inside of the town while their girlfriends/wives are forced out as well with no word as to what happened to them. Its a mystery that begins with Reacher literally tripping over a body on the outskirts of Despair and ends up being a plot about AWOL soldiers. That plot takes over for the majority of the story and it has absolutely NOTHING to do with Thurman and the steel mill and why the town keeps forcing outsiders to leave and once its solved its never mentioned again.<br /><br />The only break Reacher gets in the main story is when he hitches a ride with a preacher late in the novel. He has nothing to do with Despair and is only giving Reacher a ride and he unintentionally explains everything to Reacher. It was an eye rolling moment and it felt like Child only wrote it in because he realized he had written 75% of the book without even coming close to explaining to the readers and Reacher what the bad guys where up to. Even when Reacher goes on the attack its strangely unsatisfying this time. Other might enjoy it, but I thought it was lacking for this story. They also spend too much time talking about how Reacher sneaks into the steel mill to the point where they make it confusing, as a reader, to understand exactly how its happening.<br /><br />As for the characters they are pretty standard. Reacher has a female sidekick, a Cop from Hope (the neighboring town) named Vaughn. There are the random goons who work for Thurman that Reacher patches up in short order. But it actually gets a little boring this time. Reacher claims he is laying hospital level beatdowns on the same 2-3 guys in the book, yet the entire story takes place over maybe 4 days and he fights them multiple times.<br /><br />Its a missed opportunity and a rare mediocre entry in Child's Reacher series. Its definitely one of the weaker Reacher books I've read, right up their with A Wanted Man.
B00B23O96A|4.0|Eric Clapton obviously enjoyed recording this album. He sounds like he's having a great time and he certainly deserves it. His late career albums that I've only recently heard like 'Back Home' and 'Reptile' have been panned by most but I really don't understand fully why. He's making great music. Sure it's more polished and produced but it's always done tastefully and executed professionally. He's obviously not interested in rehashing his smoking raw guitar work of the past so get over it. Enjoy the music for what it is. His voice is relaxed, his guitar playing is still good, just not front and center. So what if he didn't write the songs, he's never been a great songwriter anyway. Give this Old Sock a chance. It doesn't stink like so many others seem to think. If you want great songwriting and stellar guitar work and vocals from a British artist of the same generation, stop complaining about what Clapton is not doing and go listen to Richard Thompson, who I  highly recommend. Eric Clapton can do what he wants at this stage of his career. Let him be.

B008FPOIT6|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning of the book much more than the end.  The method of finding the resolution was a bit, well, uninteresting.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|One of the slowest moving movies I've ever watched.  The first 45 minutes could be done in 5 minutes with the same effect.  The storyline didn't go anywhere, nothing was resolved.  Lots of gratuitous &#34;scenery&#34; shots that just prolonged the movie unnecessarily.  Don't bother.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book taught me how contemporary teens think and talk.  Their wisdom and lack thereof  and compassion were recognized by adults.  While we know how it will end, we kept pulling for these two young people and made us care.

B0083Z3O8Y|2.0|I thought this book was very disappointing. I really wasn't able to finish it. It just went on and on with no real substance.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|This movie was not as good as it was made out to be in the previews but I'm still glad I bought it to find out for myself how it was.  The seller was A #1 quality and shipping wise and the cost was reasonable.  I am pleased about this sell.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This is really one of Michael Connelly's best Harry Bosch thrillers. I was engrossed from beginning to end - couldn't put the book down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it loads fast and is easy to find! It's the perfect game for me to play with my cousins and brother and sister. Once again it's the perfect game.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Most important thing you should know is that this is not an action zombie book.  It's all retrospective and everything has already happened and humanity has survived.  It's written as a documentary of interviews with different people that went through the zombie was and their different experiences.  I'm generally into the zombie nailbiters, but I found this book very entertaining and really enjoyed it.  The zombies are pretty much class, dumb zombies so he doesn't invent any new twists to them, but he certainly gives you many different points of views from people from all walks of life from around the world.  If you're a fan of the genre, then this is definitely a must-read, if nothing else but to have a well-rounded understanding of the world during a zombie war!
B008IYR2BA|5.0|But you can's stop watching. Why am I rooting for a serial killer? The negative is the language is pretty rough.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Love this show. Missed this episode and wanted to catch up. Played clear, was convenient. Happy to be a customer.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Better then the shows or the movies.  Keep it classy.  Read more books, get away from the telescreen, it watches you as you watch it.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I love this game. But multiplayer mode is really buggy and it has so much lag. The graphics are amazing and undeniably cool. 8/10
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I really liked Around The World in 80 Days by this same developer and would recommend buying that game.  Call of Atlantis is just okay.  The colors and designs on the tiles are so muted that it is easy to lose track of the pieces you are trying to collect.  And maybe it is just my device but I find I often have to try several times before the game actually swaps the tiles I am trying to move.  I am glad it was only 99 cents.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|After seeing the movie I had to read the book-it did not disappoint me as I could see many of the lines in the movie were directly from the book-a joy-a rare gem-something to read to your young adults at home waiting for an adventure!!!
0547884591|5.0|Easy to read, packed full of great recipes and life tips.  You don't have to read everything, as the book is broken into a variety of sections.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|The initial review was written after 1 solid listen but please see the update at the end for my feelings after an entire evening.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I like all of Dido's albums. I like her voice, the orchestration, and her lyrics. Her first two had, to me, a very similar sound, and I liked it, though I understood a friend who said that they were so alike that one would do.<br /><br />Then \\"Safe Trip Home\\" came out and what struck me was while it was still the \\"Dido sound\\" but I thought that the lyrics had moved to another level of sophistication. I remember the first time hearing \\"The Day Before the Day\\" a song with lovely soft melodic sound who's lyrics were of someone losing her partner to suicide.<br /><br />I'm torn by this album. I would have been happy with \\"next next Safe Trip Home\\" but this is a much more varied album. That may appeal to some but there are aspects that just strike me as trendy for the sake of it. For instance, in \\"Let Us Move On\\" there is a section of rap with Kendrick Lamar. I didn't think it worked. There are two versions of it on the Deluxe version and that also compounded my response.<br /><br />And there are a couple of things that just fail, like \\"Blackbird\\".<br /><br />I haven't had this long enough for my initial impressions to settle. But do I like this album? Yes, and some of the variety works, and I'm glad I got the Deluxe version, as it's not just remixes.<br /><br />All in all, I like this album, though it may take a while to grow on me. Mostly, though, I'm just happy to have a new Dido album, and very willing to forgive her missteps.<br /><br />UPDATE: The things that don't work still don't work (like the rap on both versions of \\"Let Us Move On\\")  and this album isn't  nearly as much 'of a piece' as earlier ones.  But there is some amazingly beautiful work in this that brought me to tears.  Give this 2 or 3 careful listens - after doing so I wonder if it's not her best yet.<br /><br />After listening to thisalbum several times, quietly, so that I caught all of the lyrics, it has indeed grown on me.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|I recommend that you read what the other reviewers have specifically said, because they've pretty much specified in detail the strengths and weaknesses of this CD.  My favorite Dido album is still \\"Life for Rent\\" and while this new music is good (because Dido is good),  it can't quite compete with \\"Life....\\" !<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a four star album, either because Dido ran out of creativity or because she needed to be 'safe'.  Or maybe just because \\"Life for Rent\\" was so incredibly brilliant.<br /><br />But then maybe I'm being too critical of this great singer...<br /><br />By the way, much of the liner note booklet is unreadable (really poor font contrast and design).  Also, this \\"deluxe\\" version does NOT consist of TWO CD's.  There is only one CD, containing all the listed songs.

1455523550|4.0|This book was a refreshing take on a difficult subject that has been done over and over.  I disagree with the critics on Amazon that feel Sleeping With the Enemy was better or that this was the same book rehashed. Not so.  The plot is familiar, but not any more so than most themes.  There are, after all, only so many types of plots; murder, love, unrequited love, illness, serial killers etc.  This story is well done and has a unique twist.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!! The only issue I have is that I did not find it believable that Kevin could have forged on under the influence of all the booze, lack of food and the heat. The fact his failures were not discovered sooner by his fellow police officers was a stretch as well. I know enough about boozers and addicts to understand it would be physically impossible to accomplish all that he did. I suppose you could say the adrenaline rush kept him going but that is a wild stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />For some reason I found it easier to believe the Carly/Jo premise.<br /><br />This book ranks up there with The Guardian and Bend In the Road as my Nicholas Sparks' favorites.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Love to play this game but it keeps freezing up on me so I had to delete it from my Kindle and the Cloud.  May try to download it again.

1449410243|1.0|This book sounded like fun, but it was not.  More than that, it contains language that seems cheap and unnecessary to me ... don't buy this book for grandma ... in fact, I would suggest you don't buy it at all (unless you have had previous experience with the author's \\"quirky\\" sense of humor and like it).

B002GHHHIS|4.0|My bargain-rack movie for last night was \\"Tango and Cash\\" starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell. I'd have to regard it a a pretty typical Stallone movie. The acting was awful, but I really enjoyed seeing Jack Palance as the number one heavy. Somehow, he just fits the part. In any case, the others were all atrocious, as you might expect. However, to make up for it, there was some really spectacular stunt driving and a fairly-good-sized motor pool was destroyed. In addition, this movie even featured a heavy equipment destruction derby. Plus, all kinds of expensive-looking buildings were demolished, and, well you know how that goes.<br /><br />Sallone and Russell were both cast as free-lance Los Angeles police officers and a rivalry as to who was best was almost automatically set up. Alas, to get them out of his hair, Palance had them both framed and kicked off the force. Well you know that wouldn't hold. They teamed up, more or less, to beat the bad rap and joined up to rid the populace of Palance and his  cronies. Of course, the movie was full of fights of all kinds and machine-gun fire punctuated the air. Some reviewers remarked about how well Stallone and Russell worked together and what great chemistry they had. Hmmmm. I didn't see it that way. Russell came across as a lightweight, in my opinion, and it's probably a major factor in why you haven't seen a \\"Tango and Cash 2.\\"<br /><br />Well, what can I say? It's action, action, action. Death and destruction are everywhere. The language is not the best. However, the bottom line is that's it's an entertaining movie. I would not rate it as one of Stallone's better movies. I'd say it was about a 3.5-star effort, but I have no way of giving that so I'll up it to four stars.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B002WY65VU|5.0|The product I got was brand new and never been opened. The movie is great and of great quality. I would reccommend this to anyone who loves zombie movies.

B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|Haywire (Steven Soderbergh, 2011)<br /><br />I'll start off with two confessions: (a) the last Steven Soderbergh movie I actually liked was 1999's The Limey, and (b) not a single review I read of Haywire before watching the film mentioned that it was directed by Steven Soderbergh, so when I added it to my Netflix queue, I had no idea it was anything other than the Gina Carano vehicle I'd seen it painted as so many times. Soderbergh earned my eternal scorn with the trio of remakes he did just after The Limey, which desecrated two of my favorite movies of all time (Ocean's 11 and Solyaris) and turned an interesting, intelligent TV miniseries into a brainless rah-rah-rah feature (Traffic) that begged me to turn it off at least once a minute for its entire length. And I rush to add that Haywire, brainless as it is, is nowhere as awful as that trio of obscenity, but all those \\"Gina Carano vehicle\\" reviews are right, in the classic sense of the term: this is a movie that focuses the viewer's attention on Carano despite there being the usual bevy of huge-name stars who seem to cleave to Soderbergh like remora sucking on hammerheads.<br /><br />Plot: MMA champ Carano plays Mallory Kane, an ex-government operative now working for a private company headed by Kenneth (Ewan MacGregor, whose very presence in a film spells doom). As we open, she's sitting in a little diner in upstate New York, waiting to be extracted after a botched operation. Aaron (Magic Mike's Channing Tatum), another operative, shows up. We get the idea from their conversation that he was somehow involved in the operation, but we don't have details yet. He attempts to forcibly abduct her when she refuses to go with him; despite being able to take care of herself, she is aided both by a waitress (stuntwoman Debby Ross Rondell in one of her few appearances as an actress) and Scott, an innocent bystander (Red State's Michael Angarano). Presumably, the waitress has to finish out her shift, so Kane--one of only three people in the film with a given last name--grabs Scott, heads out the door, commandeers his car, and spends most of the rest of the movie in flashback, telling him about said botched operation. It seems Kenneth sent her to Barcelona to extract a guy while partnered with an MI6 agent named Paul (Hunger's Michael Fassbender). Problem is, the guy in question ended up dead, as did Paul after he attempted to kill her, resulting in Kane doing a bunch of globetrotting with agents, cops, and pretty much the rest of the world on her trail--and now her fate is in the hands of a nineteen-year-old whose greatest achievement is having just bought a Prius. (I think it was a Prius.) Can Mallory, filtering all the data she has through Scott, figure out what went wrong before she ends up in the hands of people who obviously want her dead?<br /><br />I didn't even scrape the surface of the massive names here. The opening scene, where the Barcelona job is hashed out, has MacGregor in a room with Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas, who's a really good friend of Matthieu Kassovitz' (if the name isn't as familiar as those first three, go grab yourself a copy of La Haine posthaste. I'll wait). Kane's father is played by Bill Paxton; the guy they're supposed to extract is Anthony Brandon Wong, from the Matrix franchise. I could go on and on. And while Carano is a decent enough actor for genre work, it's kind of ridiculous to expect her to hold her own with a cast of that caliber. But...she does.<br /><br />And here's where my problems with Steven Soderbergh come to the fore. Here's a guy who, at the beginning of his career, was notable for getting fantastic performances out of his actors; was Andie MacDowell ever better than she was in sex, lies, and videotape? But once you get past Terence Stamp kicking ass and taking names in The Limey, and the similarity of Stamp's role there and Carano's here has not escaped me, Soderbergh seems to have gone the exact opposite way. Everyone in this movie save Carano and MacGregor, who is never capable of acting even up to the \\"meh\\" level, gives a performance best characterized as \\"meh\\". Which, by default, makes Carano the standout. How does that happen in a movie containing Michael Fassbender, who's under consideration by a whole lot of people I know as the Best Actor Working in Movies Today (TM)? It has to be Soderbergh's direction.<br /><br />That said, if you're looking for a turn-your-brain-off action picture that showcases Gina Carano doing a whole lot of what she does best--beating people up--than Haywire is as good a choice as anything. But, man, Lem Dobbs' script is all over the place, way too complex and not nearly enough fun. Dobbs has always been inconsistent; I still have a hard time believing the guy who wrote the sublime Dark City was also responsible for the ridiculous Hider in the House (we'll also note in passing: guess who wrote The Limey?). This, however, represents a new low for Dobbs, if not for Soderbergh. **is movie save Carano and MacGregor, who is never capable of acting even up to the \\"meh\\" level, gives a performance best characterized as \\"meh\\".

030758836X|5.0|I would have loved this book if it were just what it seems to be, a well-written examination of a common-enough crime (hell, there's a whole television channel that airs almost nothing but Snapped and shows about women abducted by men)-- a beautiful wife disappears mysteriously.<br /><br />Maybe the husband killed her. Probably, even.<br /><br />The first half of the book is primarily in the pov of Nick Dunne, whose wife Amy mysteriously vanishes in what looks like a home break-in on the day of their fifth anniversary. They are living in Missouri, where he grew up, having moved back when his mother fell ill with cancer. The couple had both lost glam journalism jobs in NYC. Amy is also the model for the \\"Amazing Amy\\" children's books written by her parents, and a very wealthy, beautiful woman. We also read her diary entries from the time she met Nick until her vanishing, and he comes across as increasingly moody and distant.<br /><br />Flynn is a master at the subtle reveal of details. Nick talks about his \\"disposable cell phone\\" ringing. Hired killer calling? Girlfriend?<br /><br />The writing is outstanding, funny and vivid. Amy is portrayed as controlling by Nick, leaving clues to an annual anniversary treasure hunt that he sees as a trap to his having forgotten something she'll be mad about... then we see through her eyes how hopeful and loving she is.<br /><br />Gradually we have some things revealed.. we sense Nick is holding back. He is. Hell, he tells us he's lying.<br /><br />But does that mean he killed her?<br /><br />If the book did nothing else, it would be a great book, kind of the way \\"Room\\" is a terrific book from the pov of someone kidnapped and held hostage for years, and doesn't need to be more than that. But this is not just an inside look at a wife murder.<br />There's a twist, and then another twist, and then another twist.<br /><br />I just couldn't put the book down-- but not for plot only. There is great, vivid, fnny writing, from the pov ofboth Amy and from Nick.<br /><br />I know some people felt disappointed at the ending. I didn't. I felt the author had actually wrapped up everything that needed to be wrapped up and I realize I was kind of hoping something like that would happen.<br /><br />In the end, the only two people who really know what happened between them are Nick and Amy. But that's how it is in any relationship. Great read, great book, great writer.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have never seen the play but I know a few who have and even they agreed that this movie is great
B009FBX5M0|5.0|Thomas Newman's score for 'Skyfall' is among the best efforts of the last dozen films. Ever since the late John Barry stopped doing Bond back in 1987 with 'The Living Daylights' they have used a host of composers- and settled on David Arnold ('Independence Day') as their series composer.<br /><br />He did most of Pierce Brosnan's films, and the first two Dan Craig efforts.<br /><br />But new director Sam Mendes wanted to work with his guy- Thomas Newman- who had scored some of Mendes' other work ('Road to Perdition') and he was comfortable with Newman's work. He should be. Newman wrote a wonderful, rich, and evocative score for 'Skyfall' that while a little thin on melodies (he has several repeating motifs) it still works beautifully both with the film and as a stand alone work. The only shortcoming to the soundtrack is Adele's Oscar winning title track isn't on it.<br /><br />Highly recommended, though...
B000RO9VJK|5.0|A very well written, motivating and mind enticing book. Must read for all those looking at or already in entrepreunership.
B009S33I68|5.0|Col. Moore did an excellent job of making the reader see the Vietnam War thru the eyes of the soldiers who were there. I highly reccomend this book to all who grew up during this turbulent time...it is a real eye opener !
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I know the previous three movies were three hours long each, or even more with additional footage, but they didn't slog on the way this one does at times.  Even so, this is an interesting look at Bilbo and his first encounter with the Ring, his first adventure with Gandalf and the dwarfs, his meeting with Elrond and of course with Gollum.  Nice effects as you would expect.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down and found myself making time to read.  It's dark, so understand that before you start.  Read the annotation and if it appeals to you, it will not be a disappointment.  I have read all three and wish there were more!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I found the book a quick read but at times some of the explanations of why the author thought his experience was not related to a medical issue is confusing.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Book is misnamed.  It is a book about proving how his knowledge about doctor talk is excellent and a very long report of his illness and how brains work.  Litle to do with proof of heaven.
0440246008|4.0|compared to some of his other books, this one dragged a bit.  Jack Reacher is still a hero with sterling qualities and seminal survival skills.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book touched  me more than anything I've read in a very long time.  BRAVO  Mathew Quick ! You made even the simplest  moments  so interesting and heart-wrenching  - a beautiful story.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|You will either really like or really dislike this series.  We love it!  Very graphic in content.  Excellent from season to season.  Looking forward to season 5.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Bought this for my wife (she watched the 1 season on Netflix) and have been happy with it.  It's a fun series but sometimes you can tell what's going to happen next.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|An excellent series! Very entertaining. My husband and I look forward to the evenings we can watch an episode. Hopefully, we catch up season 3 also.
044024630X|5.0|another five stars for Child!  This is a tighly choreographed plot, great character development.  It is very easy to get wrapped up in the charcters because, Child makes them so real.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I'm a big fan of HO/click-and-point adventure games and Abyss is excellent. The graphics are great, the game play is smooth. The storyline is interesting. A great game overall.

B002SJKWZ4|4.0|I bought this for my sister for Christmas and when she opened it, everyone was intrigued. The box and the wand itself are very nicely presented but I wasn't 100% certain we would be able to make it work. After about ten minutes of reading the instructions, we were all taking turns using it. We also programmed it to the stereo and the blu-ray player, which was fun. My sister keeps it in her college dorm now and all of her roommates enjoy showing it to new people. It's a cute idea that actually works. I would recommend it for any Harry Potter fan or for someone who has everything.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Great movie, exceede my expectations,in  my opinion this were I remember about transformers back in the 80's  battles and this movie has great scenes
0425264351|4.0|Still a page turner and above the others in the genre but not as outstanding as a few in the series.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Used it to drop the overall temperature of a Dell XPS 15 L521x ultrabook by approximately 10 C. Remember to use only a thin spread on top of the CPU and the GPU and the contact points on the heatsink.
B003NSBLFY|5.0|Totally awesome!!!  And the second disc containing the editing room floor deleted scenes comprising &#34;Wake Up, Ron Burgundy&#34; don't get any better.  Very funny, good stuff....
B00846WWVM|4.0|This is a rather cute game for whole family. The difficulty keeps it interesting for older kids and adults as well..
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It is very fun and addicting. I like how in this one you can choose between 3 different people but what I don't like is that there is a fourth person that costs 55$. What is up with that and you can only unlock her by buying her
0446580848|2.0|DeMille is usually funny and clever.  Usually these traits are interwoven within a good plot.  Disappointingly, I found this book to be almost silly and in his endeavers to be witty instead seemed juvenile.
B004LKVHSY|5.0|I previously owned this DVD in its original version on regular DVD, but I have recently upgraded to Blu-Ray and I am repurchasing some of my favorites after selling my old DVD's. This item came package and in new condition and it also played fine and looked great, no scratches or marks and the case cover was also in excellent condition.<br /><br />I was glad that this seller was also approved and backed by Amazon and I would consider purchasing future items from this seller as well as recommending them to friends.<br /><br />Great buy.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I only got this book because everyone at my work was reading it and told me how Great it was.  The book it's self is well written, overall decent book.  I agree with my hubby it's like porn for a boring life with kids.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Sheriff Deveraux could not reached the rank of CEO5 in16yrs in the USMC, and she would not have left the Corp with only 4 years left for retirement.  REACHER , a Major, could not disobey an order from a lieutenant colonel even if he was not in his chain-of-command, and when the train hit the car with the Senator and his son in it it did not even slow down, much less stop to investigate.
B009EQG80W|5.0|An excellent book. I can relate almost all of the author's cases to people that I know, very insightful reading.
0425166805|5.0|If you have not read this book, I do recommend it.  He gives some good insight and theories on one of the most talked about subjects out there.  Aliens.  Where did we come from?  Will we ever know?  Erich von Daniken did an excellent job with this book.
B000MRTGW4|5.0|This is part of a bunch of mini items I bought to make a mini scene for the hubby. Perfect!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|About the same as the first,  people at work and friends wanted me to read so we could all talk about it.<br />good book.  Can't wait to see the movie though.
B00846REIS|1.0|The story was compared to Fifty Shades, a love story worth reading which is why I chose it.  Bared to You was disappointing but I was determined to get through it.  I really couldn't wait for it to end.  While there were similarities to Fifty Shades, the characters were shallow, the plot not believable and it was just too graphic for me to the point of disgusting.  I would take Christian and Ana's love story over Gideon and Eva's crazy story any day!  This was my first Sylvia Day novel - I hope they are not all like this.
1609611543|5.0|Must read for anyone of any age! Just one aspect that is a major player in feeling great and being healthy.
0307346617|3.0|I do love the concept of this.  I am however disappointed in the format that it was done in.  It is done in the form of a journalist asking questions, it's an interview.  I do wish to have read the book in a third person story line.
291193976X|1.0|On the back of the book the price is 3 euros 10 cents. The price i paid is 33 USD, + 17 USD for shipping.<br /><br />Note that the book il altogether 32 pages. Disappointed and ashamed of the selling price!

B008X8QCTO|5.0|This is one of the best mystery/hidden object game I've played and I've played a lot of different ones.  I didn't want it to end.  It did take a really long time to load on my Kindle Fire but when you see the length of the game and the elaborate graphics, you'll understand why.  It errored out a few times while loading but when I click the download button again, it started where it left off.  It was worth the wait!
B0095P33IW|5.0|just a feel good movie will watch it again and again I like to watch movies more than once I always see more the second and third time u just miss things always get a different prespective of them
0345803485|5.0|this book made me really think about my relationship and how much i love my man. it was a great read
B008K9UZY4|2.0|Nice idea, but I don't think this game translates well to a phone.  The controls are too awkward to use.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|There are a good amount  of problem  with it. The stream search use to work but now I can't find streams that aren't on the list which has made me miss some of my favorite streams also it has trouble loading streams some times making me have to put the streams in 266p which I find really annoying. But when the streams load I can watch streams where ever there is internet. So I would like to see problems like these fixed and the ability to log in and talk in chat. I mean seriously just make it like the iPhone version it can't be that hard to do.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|Great movie. Honestly a little slow for me at first. We previewed it for our eight year old and determined that it is too angst-filled and scary for him. The Orcs even gave me a heart-pounding nightmare! Great movie though.<br /><br />As far as watching it on Amazon... Tried it on our TV with our new HDMI cable and couldn't get a picture, only sound. Went to the computer to watch (15mb cable Internet speed) and could only get the small version to work without that jerkiness. So, we ended up hooking up the iPad to our speakers and watching it on that tiny screen. Boo, Amazon! We had limited time to watch it, so the waiting in between each new try and getting error messages was not fun. Amazon's email \\"tech support\\" was lame and Johnny come lately. Never had this issue before, but I wish they had sent a personal email saying, gee, sorry you had to watch this EPIC movie on your tiny screen with cables stretched across your living room for good sound. Here, have your $3.99 back and we're sorry. Ah, well, we will think twice before renting from Amazon on a Friday night!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it just reset and I lost all my money, characters, and skateboards=sucks but besides that its a great app and somettimes I have to reinstall it
0345803493|5.0|great book!! i wish there were more books that are like this out in the real world but there i cant seem to find any
B005H9B44A|5.0|This is a Must Have for any DVD enthusiast ! I Wish I could give At Least One more Star ! I Was taken to another realm indeed , as soon as the story begins !  The Characters are all well described and include more than the occasional super powers ! Odin is only surpassed in Amplitude by none other than the Gatekeeper himself ! What a Great ending , Everyone will enjoy !
B005HEFB6M|5.0|never really a trekky, until I decided to watch all of them back to back<br />this series was my favorite by far, it was just too bad there arnt a lot of seasons..

B009RX85N0|5.0|I loved to watch the show all year but watching them one after the other adds whole new levels of ties-ins and symbolism.  I love the themes of 'true love will find a way', 'short cuts/magic always has a price'.  Just plain fun.
B004QL7K70|3.0|Hey, we've all been to wild parties, and we've all been to wild parties gone. . .well, wild.  Puke on the carpet.  Broken lamps, vases, chandeliers.  Maybe a busted window (or two).  A little streaking; a lot of sex.  Definite intoxication.  And waking up the next morning (or afternoon), looking around through bloodshot eyes, and thinking, \\"I am so dead!\\"<br /><br />But when it comes to the carnage, chaos, and mayhem on rowdy display in PROJECT X, all of the above sounds like a church social.  When three nerds (Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Jonathan Daniel Brown) decide it's time for them to be \\"cool for their school\\" they use all of the social technology at their disposal (and there's a ton of it these days) to invite Youth to come over to celebrate Thomas's 17th birthday--to christen a weekend when the lad's parents are out of town.  And of course the event rapidly spirals out of control, from topless girls jumping in the pool, to an auto going in the pool, to a midget being locked in the oven, to a drunken sot literally swinging from the second story chandelier, to a flame-throwing drug dealer deprived of his Ecstasy, to an epic confrontation with police in riot gear.  Predictably the news helicopter arrives in the knick of time for viewers to look in as the house--along with a good portion of the neighborhood--goes up in flames.<br /><br />And of course, there are no real consequences, and in fact it turns out Dad (Peter Mackenzie) is just a little envious, culminating with young Thomas ultimately winning back his girl (Kirby Bliss Blanton).  Oh, and Oliver Cooper easily wins the prize for most annoying, irritating teen in cinematic histoire.  But PROJECT X is not about life's lessons. . .unless it's how to tear up stuff.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This app was for a grandchild but far too involved for her to stay interested.  As an older person I didn't quite understand it either.  May be wonderful for a teenage girl or boy  who are more savvy than us.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|Well, the sound quality is very good.  However, Turtle Beach is not being honest when it says this product works with a PC.  Here is the problem, talking into the microphone does not keep them from turning off.  So, if you are planning on using them for such things as dictation on your computer, you have to deal with them turning off every 6 min. or getting your computer to make a sound when the annoying beeps begin to occur every 4 min. warning you the headset will be turning itself off.  Of course, Turtle Beach does not mention this and in fact they are not even aware of the problem and actually sent me a new headset to replace the one I originally bought to \\"fix the problem.\\"  Obviously, the problem was not fixed and when I pointed out to them that their website says talking into the microphone will keep it from turning off, they said \\"Thank you.  We shall have our \\"custodian\\" work his way to that particular article for clean up.\\"<br /><br />Here is the link to the false information:<br /><br />Update: The filter will not let me post a link.  However, you can find the article in their knowledge base by searching for the number 830516958.<br /><br />Of course, by the time you read this they may have \\"cleaned up the article.\\"  Overall take-home message, buyer beware when purchasing products from Turtle Beach.  You may not get exactly what is advertised.  I know I will not be purchasing anything from them again!
0307454541|5.0|Super read. Very detailed and exciting. Kept me on the edge of my seat. Always want to read the book before seeing the movie.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game!  It is addictive!  I just wish I could get the fable kingdom as well. I've been waiting for it forever.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great strategy, but easy enough that my 6 year old was able to play on his own.  This is a great game for every family (although the limit of players is a bit annoying).
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My son and I have been playing this game on our phone, Samsung S3s, and we have been trying to out beat each other. Its addicting and have been playing almost everyday
B0018QQQK8|5.0|As usual for Nicholas Sparks, a great read. Always enjoy his work. Feel Good Book like all of his work.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|This book outlines economics and our current dilemma in an understandable manner.  If we don't fix our employment problem instead of going off on a tangent, chasing red herrings, we'll have to wait a much longer time for a return to &#34;full employment.&#34;<br /><br />I highly recommend this as an eye-opening look at where we are, how we get here, and an approach to how to find our way back!
B00493E1GI|3.0|I feel the film makers bit off more than they could handle making this book into a movie.  The main character and the relationships she formed were not as compelling as they could have been given that it was an adaptation of a very compelling book..
B008MEM24S|4.0|I truly love this app. WAY BETTER THAN WHERE'S MY WATER! This would be 5 stars if it weren't for this teeny tiny thing.. In one of the Doof challenges, the level was &quot;Chill Out!&quot;. And the challenge was: Complete the level without using the laser. I did and I lost somehow. If you would fix that, Disney, that would be awesome. I'm 14 and I love Where's My Water and Where's My Perry. Thank you.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|We watched the series initially streaming and the beauty of the art direction is kind of lost in the online compression. With the blu-ray all of the gorgeiousness sings!
B001F6TXME|5.0|Works well as expected.  Have had it for several months and it has held up well.  You need to be aware that there is a lock on the button that if locked makes it seem the release is not working right.  However, once understood it is easy to use.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|I still cannot believe how beautiful this album sounds to me. I have been listening to it since last week when it was available to stream. I just received my copy (deluxe edition) in the mail.<br />There are two standout elements throughout this album to me: the blues/rock influence across several of the songs and the lots of \\"space\\" allowed in the mix, so the listener have an amazing experience sensing all the different bleeps and effects that are present in this album.<br />There is one thing you should be warned: MOST tracks here are slow burners. It is important for you to allow yourself to travel through the songs. If you look for the immediacy of their 80's output (or even found in 2005's Playing the Angel), then look somewhere else. Immediate tracks are few in this album, but they are compelling: \\"Soothe My Soul\\", \\"Angel\\", and \\"Soft Touch/Raw Nerve\\" being the only examples.<br />Allow yourself to enjoy the sounds. If you do that you will find out this album is profoundly inventive and poignant. Songs like \\"Alone\\", \\"Welcome to My World\\", \\"Should be Higher\\", and the closing \\"Goodbye\\" are extremely good tracks. First single \\"Heaven\\" is perhaps on the weaker side of the album, but still it provides with a slow burner that has managed to grow on me.<br />I believe Delta Machine is the finest work Depeche Mode has put out as a trio so far. It has cohesion, it has maturity, it has a small dose of immediacy, it has a large amount of walking new grounds, too. As a fan, I am profoundly happy with this album, I tell you, 2013 is an amazing year to fall in love with Depeche Mode...
B0067R0APK|1.0|Since the update, the app sucks. Doesn't even fit the screen. To busy and ugly. Hate the POS. I'm uninstalling. Come on!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Hours of challenging fun with lots of skill levels. Colorful graphics high in the sky with twisting turns and runs through a train tunnel in a cart. Very addicting.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Great game! It combines space invaders, brick breaker and asteroids all in one. I would highly recommend this game. Love it
B003W5C0VC|5.0|have always loved the books and needed to complete my Blu-Ray collection with this one. Good to see A.H. play Hannobal again, and just different enough from the made for TV version.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I really enjoyed the audible version of this book.  The narrator is quite talented with the different voices and accents she uses.  The story itself kept me interested all the way through.  Can't wait to continue on with the rest of the series.
B0010WFGGA|4.0|There's a certain amount of fluff in this collection -- really short bits of incidental music that won't sound familiar even to a fan who enjoys the show and its music -- but it's exciting to have a recording of the really evocative themes. Murray Gold is absolutely brilliant, and the BBC Wales orchestra does a beautiful job bringing his haunting melodies to epic power.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game<br />this game is so much fun I cant seem to stop playing it<br />the graphics are fantastic and so realistic. it feels like I am careing for my own horse.
B004U7MQWE|3.0|The glitch was at a crucial scene that I wanted to know the ending at that moment, but because it \\"blipped\\" into the next scene, I just overlooked that and moved through the rest of the movie without any more incidents. The movie was good--very much would have liked to see it as a play than in movie form. It had some great actors cast and it was too heavy to really be a comedy, the intensity of the love affair was lacking and there weren't enough \\"undertones\\" to make this film amusing enough for me to want to see it again, so I am happy I found it for a reduced price and the seller was excellent enough to get the movie to me quickly. I have not watched \\"Emma\\" yet, the second disc and therefore do not know if it has any defects. The cast was amazing but it lacked the lightheartedness and the intensity of a blossoming romance. I didn't fall in love nor cheer them on like I think I would for star-crossed lovers in other romances. you can take the risk
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a entertaining game but sometimes the he does not move.no gliches just touchy.i would recomend temple run insteated its also free.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I expected this game to be less then great, but after playing it I couldn't stop. If you like Dragons of Atlantis you will love this.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|one of my favorite games to play on my on my kindle fire. glad i was able to get this game. love it!!!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|My opinion is that PicsArt Studio is thee funnest photo monkeying app I've found so far. I'm sure I'll find a better one someday. Until then, its you and me PicsArt.
B0049VZ222|2.0|This show is too dark and gritty for my tastes. I could see though that for people who can tolerate that sort of thing, it would probably be interesting to follow the personal stories as they develop - kind of like Lost but darker.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I found this book hard to put down.  It was very interesting.  If you read it you must read the whole book to really understand.
B00B8PMWJI|4.0|ABC's of Death will not be for everyone, or even for most. Anthologies inevitably have weaker entries and this movie is no exception. That said, I found ABC's of Death to be intriguing and (mostly) entertaining.<br /><br />You've got claymation, live action, heavy effect, animation, art house, and more styles that round out the 26 entries. Some go for transgressive tones while others jump into the black comedy pool. With no bridging story of through-line narrative, the movie feels more like walking into the short film section of a film festival. If you're a fan of more than one kind of horror film, I'd recommend you try ABC's. If you think good horror flicks only come in one or two kinds of flavors, then you should probably stay away.
B007RE0SCW|5.0|My daughter love it. It arrived days earlier than expected and rgw price was right. Will ve purchasing from you again really soon.
B0053TMP24|4.0|It's a good book and I would say 4 stars because it was really really good!!! But it was like an exact same thing as the first book so you kinda knew what was gonna happen… otherwise it was really good
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Very fun and amusing movie to watch. Great for kids and a disney classic for everybody. Its great to watch!
0756407125|5.0|I have read a lot of epic fantasy, and I think I may have to say that this is the best of that genre I have ever read. It takes fantasy and makes it as believable, epic, emotional, and engrossing as anything I've read. I would recommend this to anyone with even a passing interest in fantasy. Just be warned that it will be hard to find an equal afterward. Just as good as the first book, if not even better.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I just watched this concert and absolutely loved it, The quality was excellent as was the entire program. I would recommend it to every one.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|i like the game a lot its fun and entertaining game. I would recommend this game to my friends and family
B003730LRY|5.0|Very entertaining and funny. A classic as well. Very good movie to watch. Not boring in any aspect perspective whatsoever.
B00BI745AA|1.0|I usually like musicals, but I don't like them when 99% of the script is sung. It gets old really quick.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|I could not get this to work on my Kindle Fire. I had high hopes, but in the end, I purchased a planner in book form.  (See Songbirds of America Weekly Planner.)
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I found it riveting.  Quite enjoyable, although I might have judged it an &#34;also-ran&#34; in this year's field.  I quite jumped a couple of times.  Great acting.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Both my 3 year old son and I enjoyed it.  It is on the edge of being too scary for him, but the story makes it less so.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very cleverly written. I was interested throughout. Character development was good, but I was left wanting more in some cases. I did NOT like the ending. I felt angry and frustrated.  Some of my friends speculated that the author may have a sequel planned.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Best bingo game I have tried. I wish there was a way to trade with people without friending them. The awards are nice to get.
B009O2XY12|1.0|Seemed pretty pointless to me.  Also, it wasn't long before it was asking for money.  I wasn't willing to pay for it, for sure.
B008W14ZD2|4.0|As much as I hate to admit it, iTunes has another song on this album.  If you haven't ever heard Owl City before, that's fine, but any hard-core fans need to *shudder* go to iTunes.  *shudder* I'm so sorry...
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down!  It kept me guessing, heart racing, until the very end.  Gillian Flynn is amazing!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Very enjoyable period piece that covers real life struggles of class, gender and principle differences.  I had a blast watching along with my young daughters.
B000002OR4|5.0|I would highly recommend that EVERYONE see the movie, and think the CD is a great reminder of what the<br />movie was about.<br />Have no dislikes...the music was very well done and just the right length, not drawn out etc.<br />This part of our history should never be forgotten, and this CD can be a little emotional...
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I enjoyed the dark humor. While I wouldn't recommend it for kids, I found it entertaining. I'm surprised it did not beget a television spin-off.
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|JT is trying too hard to be D'Angelo, Robin Thicke, Frank Ocean, etc. Timbland did good with the music, but JT lacks any passion in his singing and I have no idea what he's talking about in the songs. His lyrics are up there with Justin Bieber...\\"Hot like an Oven\\" lol
B009KEN87O|5.0|Such a well made game. Plays beautifully on my S3, and is challenging enough to be fun and not frustrating. This is one of the best &quot;just one more level&quot; time eaters I've played in a long while!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I read this book because I liked the Author.  A very intreging story and a very interesting ending.  Thought there was a little too much shifting from one situation to another.  A little too fast in some cases.  Overall, a great book,
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love playing this game in the afternoons and evenings.  It provides a great challenge while not being totally frustrating.  My only woe is that I am almost out of levels to do!  I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|A bit of a slow start, but after that I couldn't put it down. It helped, that I've followed DD's music for most of my life. It was so great to get a view behind the curtain, and read how things really were for John, in those years of mass hysteria. He's just a normal guy, with an extraordinary life.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is a very interesting and unique collection of songs from a new band.  I would recommend the album, but it requires a few listens to really begin to appreciate the tunes,
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book wad amazing all the action and twists and turns were amazing LOVE LOVE LOVE def read this book in fact read the hole series
B006LSZECO|5.0|I appreciate novels written in a different style than the boring, standard narrative. This book certainly transcends the common. An excellent read.
1848566190|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1BY4ZK1VTXBRT]]Drew Struzan must be considered one of the best movie poster artists in history.  His posters capture the spirit and excitement of some of the most memorable films ever made.  In the 70s and 80s he was most prolific, creating posters for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Back to the Future.  But he's done some remarkable work more recently as well, such as Hellboy and the first two Harry Potter movies.<br /><br />As you'd expect, the book is full of artwork - some of it printed full-page in high quality.  One of the interesting things about the book is that you don't see just the finished posters, but you see them in various stages of completion.  There is often also alternate artwork for many of the movies - posters that Mr. Struzan completed but were not used by the studio.<br /><br />But this isn't just an art book, it contains text as well.  The book starts off with a great foreword by Frank Darabont (director of The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Mist), who frequently uses Struzan and writes about why his posters are the best in the business.  And then as you flip through the book, Struzan becomes the author and writes about each project.  Struzan's anecdotes are interesting to read, and he discusses what he was hoping to achieve with each poster and working with directors over the years.  Another idea he puts forth is that he's not very happy with the way movie posters are heading these days.  And I agree with him.  I always preferred the more artistic painted movie posters over the typical mash-up photoshop jobs you see today.<br /><br />There is also another book out if you are interested in Struzan's work: [[ASIN:0857685570 Drew Struzan: Oeuvre]]
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Great album, by an interesting new band,  When I saw this band on SNL a few weeks ago, I had to buy the CD.  Very refreshing to see a band that actually plays real music, is free of gimmeckery, and does not need either a fleet of scantily clad dancers or a rapper/Hip-Hop goon with only one name to accompany them.  These guys are the real deal.
B00992CF6W|5.0|well, I do not have it yet, but I am going to this week. I already have the free addition on my mom's iPad And its great! I cant imagine how amazing the full version will be! just one question for the kindle fire users, is it good on the kindle? is it worth the seven dolars? please answer! I want to know if it is worth it before I buy it. :)
B001GKJ2FC|1.0|i bought about 10 used blu rays from amazon and this is the only one i bought that was &#34;like new&#34; and came in with the case broke completely in half! the blu ray disk is fine but the case for it is completely destroyed disappointed wont be buying from James McAvoy again!
B00B935SUY|5.0|For any music, audio, engineering, mixing, and anything else fan. I finished this film motivated, and encouraged in my line of work.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you plan on publishing for Kindle, you absolutely must read Building Your Book for Kindle.  It's clear, consist, and worth the asking price.
0385537816|5.0|Outstanding trilogy story! A little graphic, but i had to read to see what all the hype was. I thought it had an excellent story to tell!
0880794968|5.0|I love this deck. The size is right, the colors are bright and uplifting. The perfect deck for me as a beginner.
0760703329|5.0|once upon a time I had this book in a different form ...but this leather bound book with gold and vibrantly colored accents is far better than the pervious one in my possession. Beautiful outside and rich with passion inside.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The producers and creative staff of this show really do a fantastic job recreating the scenery and fashions from the period. Also has some very in depth character development. Highly recommend for all ages.
B00C0OLL52|5.0|Normally I don't purchase shows, but these guys have just done such an amazing job with the Walking Dead that for once in my life I'm actually purchasing these shows each week they come out. Amazon instant has no commercials and gives you EXACTLY what you pay for. I very strongly recommend that if you're into the show, you buy it right here.
B00498TQV8|5.0|I had no idea that someone could act as well as Miss Jennifer. So far I've seen Silver Lining and the Hunger Games. This one was even better.
0553805371|5.0|I have gained a deeper respect for Hawking .... He and Einstein will be known not only for their brilliant brains, but their inimitable and unmistakable character qualities
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I did not think I would like this show after reading what it was about.  But I was so wrong!  This show has some great characters and some crazy plots!
0470901071|5.0|This book was very easy to follow with great flow.  The author really knows how to make something hard for the unfamiliar and dry, very easy to understand and follow.<br /><br />I've read many IT text books in my day, such as 2 CISSP books, AD books and this has to be one of the easiest to comprehend.  I highly recommend this book if anyone is studying for the CCNA.<br /><br />To pass the test though, you will need to supplement your study of this book with lots of practice test questions and simulation labs.  This is not a knock on this book whatsoever, it is just usually the case with IT exams, you won't get enough information to pass the test with just one resource.  The labs are heavily graded on the exam.  Look for the sim labs online.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My husband and I were riveted.  Watched the series over a three day period. Enjoyed it that way as the plot unfolded quickly.  Disappointed that series two is not presently available on amazon
1878424319|5.0|not to mention they already released a fifth agreement, this book will certainly add four inspiring things to practice putting into existence in your everyday ritual.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the most realistic zombie apocalypse shows ever!  Can be a bit bloody at times so take caution if you don't like that sort of thing.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|We saw this at the movies and had to own it.  One of my best animated films that I have seen in a while.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This book is so powerful. Everybody can relate to Hannah in one aspect or another. Every time I read this book, it's like I'm reading it for the first time
6301792734|5.0|A long time ago, in a distant dimension I began watching these movies...Now, I pass the torch to my children and begin them on their own journey through the forces of the universe into the interplanetary development of their minds.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I like the overall package of this movie. the extras are great... the only thing that would have made it perfect would have been to add the option for digital file capability through ITunes or Ultraviolet
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book series. This book sparked my interest and I read the entire series in a matter of days! Can't wait for the movie to come out!
B00BSW6F26|2.0|Game was too short and was very difficult to get help or even instructions on how to start the game. Disappointing.
0060527986|3.0|After readin the stories of Paulo Coelho, you can't really say a simple quote is as great...but sometimes that's all you really need to remind you of your excellence ... still, I'd rather read one of his wonderful adventures through the East and have this book alongside as downtime entertainment.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Pitch Perfect was one of the funniest movies of last year and the music alone is enough to keep going back to it. This soundtrack features every major song performed on-screen, performed by the actors in all their A Capella glory! If you were a fan of the movie then this is a no brainer, A-ca-believe it!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|A great follow up to City of Bones. I have recommended this series to everyone. It is seriously that good!!
030758836X|2.0|To fully appreciate this book, it is necessary that one has never actually read a book before.  Price is right if you borrow it from someone.
0061122416|5.0|a story that begins exactly where it ends...but there's so much adventure in between you can't help reading it over again just to see the whole thing unfold in your imagination once more.
157421327X|5.0|Love it!  Would recommend to anyone wanting to know what Zentangle's is all about.  Very easy to understand and do.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I've read all of the books and this one was my favorite. On the edge of my seat the entire read!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Hollywood still knows how to make a film that entertains and informs about out own history. A must see flick.
034580404X|1.0|I have truly enjoyed reading the one star ( because you have to give at least 1 star reviews.).  Thanks for the laughs and the savings of time and money.  This review system is pricesles!!!!
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This is an excellent book. It offers much in the study of travel in a wilderness. It offers even more as a psychological journey. It reflects common emotional experiences applying to most walks of life.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|Great for introduction teaching for photography. Gives you great information and tips. I keep it on my iPad so I can reference it quickly during a shoot.
B00BF11STU|4.0|A lot takes place before you get to an end that could have been a bit more engaging. Glad we got Bin Laden...just sorry it took so long, whether in real life or in this film. Still  good film and one everyone should see.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Open ended movie that requires thought and deep thinking.  Completely about faith and what one believes in.  All children of God
006220629X|3.0|The Prisoner of Heaven by Carlos Ruiz Zafon is the third novel about Daniel Sempere following The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game though it is intended to stand on it's own. I very much enjoyed The Shadow of the Wind and was excited for the chance to read and review Zafon's newest book.<br /><br />Daniel is working alone at the family book store in Barcelona when a mysterious man with a limp and a missing hand comes into the store. He buys the oldest and most valuable book in the store, overpays and then leaves the book with an inscription for Daniel's friend Fermin. When Fermin returns he is able to shed some light on the mysterious man and the book goes back to Fermin's history as a political prisoner during the Spanish Revolution. The bulk of the book focuses on this history. I was intrigued by the dark and cryptic characters that Fermin met in prison. Zafon sets up an absolutely fascinating and thrilling mystery. Zafon writes well. With short chapters and plenty of action and suspense, he makes his readers want to keep turning the pages well after bedtime.<br /><br />The trouble is that once the novel goes back to Daniel and Fermin, the mystery falls flat. It's not that frightening and not that perplexing. And while, Zafon leaves the ending open for another novel, the loose ends are not tied up well enough to made The Prisoner of Heaven a stand-alone work. The Prisoner of Heaven lacks the depth and insight of The Shadow of the Wind and I was disappointed to reach the last page without a satisfactory ending. However, I will likely read Zafon's next book hoping to find the answers to questions left open in this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is enjoyable and entertaining. I love playing this wonderful game.it is thrilling, great with good characters and extra things like jetpack, multiplier, bounce boots and lots more! I would definitely recommend this awesome game!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|This is perfect for when you want a gentle pleasant environment.  Played quietly it can fill in or mask shared-office sounds or the urban street noise outside a window without being distracting.  It's minimalist.  It's soothing without being maudeline like new age &#34;spa music&#34; tends to be.  I wish they actually played this in all the airports, it would make traveling much more pleasant.  Oh well, you can always use Amazon's Cloud Player to pipe it to mp3 player of phone when at the airport.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|worst fb app ever. better just open it in the browser and that s all. not worth downloading it. period!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love this series. It will keep me glued to the tv for hours. Can't wait for the next episodes. Awesome!
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|i liked watching all of the episodes without the commercial interruptions - but there were a couple of skipping DVDs included and that part was frustrating.  I had to go to specific scenes to make it run through the skip areas.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I very good love story. Did not know it was a movie until after I had read it. Loved it
078322611X|5.0|My son and I have decided.we are going to watch this before his baseball season starts as a preseason tradition
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series. It will keep me glued to the tv for hours. Can't wait for the next episodes. Awesome!
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|Read it to my 5 year old and she loved it!  A few words I had to change on the fly due to aggressive language.  The book is probably best suited for 8-12 year olds.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Great read that will give one a wider perspective on life. I believe one can use these tips in everyday life as well. If you are going through hardship in life then this is a must read. Viktor's unique and fascinating account of life in a concentration camp is both intriguing and inspiring. Safe to say that not many people would have the courage to analyze and write a book out of such a harrowing and cruel experience. Viktor is truly inspiring.  For me this book showcases the amount of adaptability and resilience some of us are capable of given the right mindset, self respect and  mental thinking techniques.
0425263908|5.0|Read in just three days. Great book. Very similar to fifty shades of grey. Could get enough of the book and didn't want to put it down clearly! Can't wait for book number three!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book could be a hand book for some people who went to Vegas and believe what was done in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Think about it.  It just pulled me in.  I very much enjoyed it.
076421120X|5.0|Revealing Jesus: A 365 Day Devotional byDarlene Zschech is a powerful devotional for the whole year long.  These short readings help to center you on Christ and reflect on His presence in the ordinary.  With Biblical passages and encouraging words, this is the perfect little guide to help you start (or end) your day on a positive note.  Zschech's approachable style makes each reading feel like an intimate Bible Study. This devotional is wonderful and is the easiest way to have a year that helps you Reveal Jesus.  I honestly have come to look forward to these devotions in my daily routine.
B0010OIN90|4.0|I love the Lego watches. Everyone asks about this watch. The racer watch looks the coolest to me. I enjoy having the analog hands on the dial because it's like the gauges in a race car, too.
0425263916|5.0|Loved the book. Couldn't put it down. The love story was great and highly recommend! Still waiting on the third book that I pre ordered because the first two book were so awesome.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Great Game for all!  With varying levels of difficultly everyone in my family plays this game.  Basic idea is become the largest by &#34;absorbing&#34; others smaller than your self.<br /><br />Several different game modes but all in all there is something here for everyone.  I use it as a great way to take 10 minutes at lunch or when ever to clear my thoughts and relax.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|first time reading this author.<br />this book kicks a**<br />I'm not a very big reader of vampire stories, but you will come away with<br />a totally different view of vampires, after reading this one.<br />this is sort of a steampunk/paranormal/regency romance.<br />you would think that would be too much, but this author brings it all together spectacularly!<br />I didn't want to put it down!!!!!!<br />and now I want MORE!<br />cannot wait to read more by Ms. McMaster!!!
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you have already known everything about them it will still be fascinating, the images, videos, sound, its everytning perfect. It is amazing the quality of some 60s videos, first concerts, appearence, just awesome.  Personally I made a copy of all CDs to keep them new. And I can see everything over and over.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This series is absolutely one of the finest !  Storylines interwoven, stunning characters, breathtaking cinematography.....from the beginning you will be hooked !
B000ITF86E|5.0|I loved this movie, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara are great together.  I have watched all of them. They are all classics
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This movie was such an interesting and thought provoking movie.  Like a fine piece of art.  Beautiful.  I am contemplating purchasing the HD copy.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Going through dowton Abbey withdrawals so I decided to check out the old series first. found that very boring. this new series is much more interesting. loved it!
1455523550|4.0|The book is a combinaton of suspense with a love affair thrown in! I couldn't wait to read the next page!
B002S45V32|5.0|I love the movie, the stars that are in it are still acting some great movies and TV shows.  A Classic!
B00BRR66SA|4.0|& his music off this album is amazing. My favorite songs off this album would have to be Pusher Girl & Suit and Tie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am looking forward to any future books Hugh Howey writes. His stories really grab you and stay with you.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I usually have a manual white noise machine going at night...it blocked out street noise and helped my kids and I sleep.  BUT it drives my husband  nuts and now that we've moved to a quieter location he really needed a change for his own sleep sanity.  Time will tell if this will be a lasting  solution, but for the time being it has really helped me.  And I LOVE that there is a combination rain and  thunder storm option...square!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|If you liked Starship Troopers, you'll probably like Old Man's War. The geriatric twist is the biggest difference from the classic.
B008YCMM2A|4.0|I picked this up, because I like Chick, Miles, Wayne Shorter. It didn't disappoint. They sound could have been better, although it is pretty good for a video from 1969. The bass seems a little low in the mix. I've heard that Vol 1 of the series has a similar issue.<br /><br />There are a few things that I would change. Firstly, there is little change of repertoire over the 3 discs and DVD. Granted, all the performances were noticeably different, but If there were other tracks available, I would have liked to hear them. I prefer the acoustic version of Nefertiti over the electric one, for example. Were there other acoustic performances?<br /><br />On the DVD, there weren't any graphics to note when they started new charts. Sometimes the transitions are very difficult to catch, and the graphics might have helped.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I bought it, and will order Vol 2 when I can afford it.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|There was nothing original at any point in this movie. There were some pretty neat special effects but I just wish they would have shown them and forgotten the rest. I cant watch a movie with Little Leo in it without flashing back to that bow scene from that awful movie Titanic that I was forced to watch with the wife!! I cant stand the creep!
B007N6NGYG|1.0|The game had great graphics but would not work right on my android. I think it was because it was such a big game mb wise that my android couldnt handle it
0765365278|4.0|Pretty simple arguement from me, Shallan sucks in all ways shapes and forms, I started skipping her parts of the book because I have read a few books before that do the exact same as happens with her. She is boring, nauseatingly naive, and most of all predictable, and this is a guy who after the first time Kaladin held a sphere after a highstorm knew exactly was happening...<br /><br />Other than that sniveling lady the book is gloriously well written and the plot is incredible, I figure that she will have a big part to play in the saga, but I refuse to read her sections after chapter 45.
0553208845|4.0|Would give it 5 stars except that it lacked sturdy shipment protection. Ii arrived in an envelope easily bent and so the book - meant to be given as a gift - arrived bent.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|It's been a long time since I thoroughly enjoyed a book on such a high level. This book has grown on me over the years. As a child I couldn't really start it and as a teenager I didn't get it well enough to get through the first eighth. Definitely worth the wait and the time invested. I would recommend it for anyone who has been drawn to It and the not often discussed aspect of ones fears.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Downloaded this on my android and it works great!!!!!! Love the graphics and the game. Sometimes frustrating but if you work hard enough at it it eventually gives you enough hints to win. Will keep the game to play again.
0060170123|3.0|It is probably a great book, but the print in this edition was too light for me to read easily.  So gave it away.
B001B93H0O|5.0|i'm really satisfied with this purchase.  It's fun and doesn't seem like your exercising. I love to dance and fits my schedule. Great seervice with this purchase from the seller.
0345525558|4.0|I read this book on vacation.  It was a fast read.  A page turner. I stayed up later to continue reading. But near the end, maybe last 1/3rd of the book, I began skimming.  I think the book kind of falls apart in the end.  It's not horrible but not really satisfying.  I would still recommend because so much of it was enjoyable.
1476712042|5.0|I love this book and every line in it! I can not wait for my copy of Walking Disaster!<br />Thank you Jamie McGuire!
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Got off to a good start, but missed the mark. Good analysis of habit but quickly became frustrating... kind of like overstating the obvious, no real handles on how to implement habit or habit change. In short, not what I was looking for... bought it looking for suggestions and accountability... not there.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I thought this movie was going to be really funny. It was just pretty much offensive and not funny at all. Wish I could get a refund. Don't waste your time or your money on this one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Even if you think you won't like the period stuff. You will LOVE this. It isn't boring and there's so much going on. Tip: Don't watch season 2 before season 1, you have to watch this in sequence otherwise you won't understand the story.  Sooo good though!!
B00BYOEZTI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. I have to write these extra words before it will accept my review apparently!
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Fantastic read!  I wasn't sure what to expect, but so glad I took the initiative to read this wonderful account.
1885167776|5.0|I was fortunate enough to receive an advanced copy of this book and I have to say that The One Thing is easily the best book I've read in terms of business or personal productivity.  I've heard Gary Keller and Jay Papasan lecture many many times on these concepts but never had I heard (or read) them when put together so concisely and to the point.  I can't remember being personally impacted more by a book.  I truly believe this book holds the \\"secret\\" to what we want in life.  I say \\"secret\\" because its hardly a secret =)<br /><br />Do yourself a favor buy this book and put its concepts into action quickly.  It will change your life if you allow it to.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Not sure why we chose to watch.....  but got hooked in a hurry!!!  Wonderful!  Have finished season 1 and watched first episode of season 2.
B000FGGE68|4.0|Loved the special effects that made this movie of the so-called<br />future move enjoyable.  And my husband doesn't usually like<br />these kind of movies, but liked this one.
B00B769XB8|4.0|This movie is just good ole fashion fun and very entertaining real good cg and great 3D great for your 3d collection
0547884591|5.0|This is a book for the person that gets bored reading books.  It is very well written with a wide variety of knowledge.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is uber fun!!!  G5 games can be tedious but this game is alot of fun!!  I am enjoying this game!!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Great movie for both kids and adults both.  The animation was super<br />and made me feel like i was apart of the actions.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son love's this game. It is good for trip's on the rod. I hope they just keep inproving fast!
B007EECSFA|3.0|The author is British so some of the phrases and descriptions are unfamiliar to me.  It is somewhat hard to get into the novel.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is usually difficult to make a second book in serious better than the first but E L James did it.
B000002UAO|5.0|It is great to listen to the music of the Beatles and Rubber Soul is one of the best ever
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The story line is unique and interesting.  The actors place a realistic spin on the unknown.  I plan on watching the complete series..
B008XNZMOU|5.0|First, I love many different kinds of music as reflected by my purchase history.<br />Taylor swift is consistent in her quality of music. I'm occasionally surprised, but usually satisfied by her music.<br />This album really catches my ear.<br />The songs on here are the kind that I'll listen to several times in a row to get out of my head, and later find myself humming to a tune I don't recognize until several seconds in.<br />If nothing else, there isn't anything like a catchy tune.
9802931500|3.0|el libro estaba roto , asi que tuve que pegarlo, para la proxima no lo compro tan barato como pensaba
B001BOXJZW|4.0|I first saw Dana Fuchs in the movie Across The Universe, based on Beatles songs, and the days of the late 60's. She is remarkably talented, and I am a new fan
B008476HBM|2.0|I really wanted to read this book after hearing so many references to it over the years. I also really wanted to love it but I was very disappointed. The characters were shallow, self-indulgent and reeked of snobbery with no redeeming qualities at all. I know this was the essence of the story as suggested by the title, I was therefore determined to read the whole book to give it a chance. But it was tedious to read with it's old fashioned phrasing and having to look up so many redundant words. Maybe my expectations were too high but I just don't get the fuss made over this book.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This album is the way Jimi wanted these songs to sound I'm sure he'd approve I think every Hendrix fan should own this album as part of there collection
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I hate that you must have WiFi to operate this app. Makes me miserable. Tried it in several locations and it still didn't work and never recognized the WiFi at all. About to uninstall.
B006Z21ZJC|4.0|Maiden is back and rocking as much as ever! This is the perfect DVD for Maiden fans who like their new material - and easily worth it just for When The Wild Wind Blows!<br /><br />However, if you are not a fan of the new material, you should instead purchase Maiden England 88'. It has all of their go-to classic hits that they play on _ever_single_dvd (seriously guys, change it up a bit), as well as a few more obscure classics such as &#34;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&#34;.<br /><br />Perfect for the hardcore Maiden fan!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game drives me crazy but I love it to say the least.  Christmas day 5 of use were playing it on different toys... iPad, lap top, 2 Kindle Fires and desktop.  It all started with me playing it :)
B002L6I9Z4|4.0|We have not given it to our grandson yet. We can't wait to see it in action because he loves Legos.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|A girl in Bolingbrook,IL killed herself over what happened over Facebook. Before she hung herself in her family's garbage she wrote her a mom a twelve page confession on why she killed herself. What happened on Facebook was just plain cruel. Shewas being called all  sorts of names and it was real mean. I think while she was going through this she probably started to change just like Hanna but no one noticed the signs cause she was so intelligent. The book is awesome and I recommend it to everyone of the teenage and adult age.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|If you stick with it, the book is very interesting and provides an ending I didn't expect.  It's a good book, but you have to be committed to get started.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like the game...I do not like when they have the &#34;Black Hole&#34; free and you Have to use them in every game until they are gone... I also don't care for the fact that the little bear pops up and if you click it, by mistake, you use 5 golds for 15 sec. more of play.  Messed me up Again today............
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|A very different kind of movie from what I typically watch and what you see in theaters in the U.S.. I didn't really care for it (just my opinion!)
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja didn't really look all that fun, but I got it to see what all the hype was about....OMG this game was fun, I wasted hours on this app without knowing it. The game is completely free, everything is unlockable in the in game store, and fun to unlock. Sound is awesome, and controls are responsive. Cons: The game did lock up once or twice and I bad to restart my kindle fire to get it to unlock, other than that there is nothing bad I can say about this game. Get it and enjoy hours of fruit slicing fun. You can always always delete it if you don't like it.
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|This CD should be in genre of wimpy rock (if I could create my own genre).  I think Bon Jovi should have stuck to doing less than mediocre country, at least they got song that stuck on the charts out of it.  This CD is filled with political innuendos and other inspirational trash, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS!!!  Bon Jovi had its time in the 80's, now its time to retire to the senior home where you guys can reminisce about the days you were releavant!  Just to clarify, i'm not a Bon Jovi hater, I date back to the power station years if you fans know what I mean.  To sum things up, don't waste your time or money, go on youtube and watch \\"Livin on a Prayer\\", \\"Keep the Faith\\", and other classics to remind yourself of what this group once was.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's good and fun and I like  it c<br />uzz u can play<br />Yeah it is a game as u can see so try it if u want
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|love this show, not sure why -  need to keep watching it in my free time -  word word word
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I like this book because it keeps you on your seat the whole time and you can't tell what is going to happen next. I read this book about 5 times and it was worth my wile.
B009X01ELC|5.0|Not only does it protect my Kindle but the rotating screen and placement of hands (using the hand band) makes using My Kindle very adaptable to any situation.
B007704HO6|4.0|Light and enjoyable reading with a very good background story showing how animals really do help recovery in many cases.<br /><br />NW
B002WTOXUK|5.0|This is one of the most profound (social) science fiction movies we have ever seen.  My wife is a teacher and historian, doesn't care for run-of-the-mill science fiction, but loved this movie.  It reflects very graphically many of the injustices rampant in today's world, but offers distant hope, as does the current trend of world events.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The trilogy was at long last collected on the blu ray disc format and is now ready for your viewing pleasure. Marlon Brando will steal your heart and entertain your mind. The Coppola Restoration is finally here own it today
B00000K2W1|5.0|Can't go wrong with classic Janis!  This is a good selection of most memorable hits, at a really attractive price.
0307740919|5.0|Toni Morrison's Home  left me feeling at once immersed in the story and voyeuristic as if I was staring in the window at secrets that weren't mine to know. Morrison's story telling once again reads like a lyrical documentation of a segment of the characters' lives. As usual she left me wanting to know what happened to Frank and Cee after life continued even as I imagined their lives following a familiar course. Morrison captures slices of life that grab our hearts and make us think about people whose circumstances may differ from our own. Home is the quintessential story of a search for life that always brings one back to one's roots. Morrison always delivers just as she does this story of family, secrets, and survival. Reading Home feels like taking a trip home...
B002SSUQFG|5.0|It's a very functional watch, that is exactly as advertised.  It was the most reasonably priced watch that offers the features included.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|read which ever version you are comfortable with, in many different languages<br />look up specific information with a single word
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This is a great collection of unpublished sessions which were probably deemed &#34;not commercial enough&#34; at the time.  It is pretty much all blues oriented, and really showcases Jimi's musicianship over showmanship.
B00632HWOG|4.0|It's so convenient to pick up my email on my Kindle instead of having to open my computer. This is a nice app.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The video and audio quality are fantastic. Special features are okay, nothing amazing there. Definitely worth it for GOT fans.
B004WR125O|4.0|just plug and play not much to say about this device but to say  it work easy to used and set up.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Love, love, love this show!!! It's just too bad their were only twelve episodes made. BUMMER!<br />I will still watch them over and over again and still laugh! The interviews of the cast are priceless to me and to see all the cast members talking about the production and where and how the concept was born is so enjoyable! John Cleese is a TRUE MASTER of comedy and I only wish I could Thank him in person for the years of GREAT entertainment he has brought to millons of TV viewers throughout the years!
B00005LK94|4.0|This is a fun video to watch if you like animal stories. Yes it is directed toward kids but the young-at-heart will also enjoy this movie!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Fringe is a great show. My husband and I always look forward to watching it together. Highly recommend watching this show.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|As an avid lover of books and flowers, I was excited about the premise of this book. It was fascinating for me to learn what each flower represents in a story like fashion instead of merely looking up a dictionary. However I found the dialogue stilted and the plot predictable.
B00973902K|5.0|I had to have this song by: Carly Rae Jepson! It's full of life and makes you want to get up and dance! This is a very talented young women who I believe is going places! We haven't heard the last from her!!!
B008C20TDG|5.0|I'm a personal trainer, and I have recommended this book to all my clients. It's well written and covers a lot of the common questions people have. There are a few small things I disagree with, but overall I think it is a great approach to developing a good mindset and relationship with food.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I never read this as a kid.  Don't remember why I picked it now, but found it a most thrilling, easy-to-read book.  Recommend for all ages, although some kids might not pick up on the language.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|The graphics are beautiful and very colorful, the puzzles engaging, and the story is not too dark. All in all, well worth the $4.99. Way good fun.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I've played the other hungry shark games, and they were ok, but this puts a whole new name on FGOL. This is not just a game, but a friggin awesome game! you get new sharks, upgrades, decorations for your sharks, and amazing graphics. Now I've read some of the reviews, and they've said their games' have reset. I just hope FGOL notices this and fixes it before it happens to other people or me.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|As a high school student who is 2 months away from graduation, I honestly wanted to drop out of school until I read Manson's book.  He went through school and accomplished it with a degree in writing.  People are scared and fearful when his name is said but they cleary don't know how intellegent he really is.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|One of my late father's and my favorite movies , we watched it many times together and now I watch and remember
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Whether you liked SOTU or not - I happen to love it and stand by my review - Depeche Mode's latest album has the makings of a modern classic.  To anyone who thinks that Violator was their crowning achievement, this album will make you reach out and touch faith all over again.  For starters, it's built on the same musical veneer as Violator but that's where the similarities end.  The heavy hooks are traded for lighter, nimbler ones on a canvas that leaves a lot of white space for maximum effect.  Musically, the airiness of a less-is-more approach to the arrangements gives the album an almost ethereal, trance like quality that propels it to greatness, underscored by deft studio production from Ben Hillier and Flood and skillful flourishing touches from Christoffer Berg.  The result is a fresh sounding modern piece that delivers catchy melodies and pleasing sounds, much like the bonus material on the SOTU box set, in particular Ghost and Light, two of the best songs they've recorded and sound absolutely terrific, but I digress...Other than for Flood's involvement I didn't detect much of an influence from SOFAD, with the possible exception of All That's Mine.<br /><br />Virtually every song is a standout and some like Slow, Soft Touch/Raw Nerve and My Little Universe deliver a refreshingly varied approach.  A particular favorite of mine is Alone whose lyrics I found especially haunting:  \\"I couldn't save your soul; I couldn't even take you home\\".  Goodbye is another haunt but more in the way it is sung.  Other gems include Angel, Welcome to My World, Secret to the End, Broken, Always, All That's Mine, Happens All the Time and Long Time Lie (the last four appear on the deluxe version).<br /><br />Through it all, one can't help but appreciate how great Dave sounds; his pristine vocals are delivered pitch perfect.  There's really not a weak moment on the album though I found that a couple of songs (Soothe My Soul, Goodbye), excellent in their own right, could have benefited from a little less repetition in the chorus.  Another song, The Child Inside had an all too familiar sound to it and could have easily been substituted on the main album with Always, arguably the best Martin-sung song since Ultra.  Heaven is a bit of an anomaly.  It's truly a great song but demands patience from the listener.  Plucked from the album as the first single it may come across as a fish out of water in the singles charts but its unique production befits a Depeche Mode song and having listened to it many times, it has grown on me to the point where I no longer question its selection. I'm sure others may see it differently particularly when compared to some of the more upbeat songs like its successor, Soothe My Soul.<br /><br />With this album, I feel that Depeche Mode have elevated their music to a different realm that will expose them to a new generation of fans, while heightening their appeal to fans of such artists like Muse and  Trent Reznor.  All in all, it's a stellar album and one that's bound for glory and longevity.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I absolutely love this game! I wish I could exchange coins for acorns but other than that I love this game
B004GHNIRK|4.0|You get the feeling that Hugo, like many of the old novelists, writes way too much background but believe me, he ties it all together.  I have not seen the play or movie so they are not influencing my opinion, I just thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  You are placed in Paris after the Revolution and get a fantastic view of what life was like and everyday struggles that can be contemporary.  The title refers to the struggles which take you easily through the book and make it very difficult to put down.  This is an excellent work but it isn’t one that makes you feel good all the way through.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in reading something that is well written.
0517543052|4.0|Be here now is All. This book is abnormal but it contains everything about You. You can catch the wisdom of life.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This movie is INSANE. Have watched it twice in 2 days and can't get enough of that damn climatic final battle. Expertly crafted, directed, acted and scored. A must-see for any action aficionado. Best to let the movie sucker punch you by going into without any knowledge of plot or trailers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|People who don't know if they should buy minecraft  please read this.it has crafting in it..there are 2 modes survival, and creative survival has midnight witch means monsters like zombies, spiders,creeper,and skeleton archers. There are many fake minecraft  apps but these are a few good minecraft apps,block story,and survivalcraft.oh I forgot to tell you about creative mode. You have infinite everything and you can fly. So all in all minecraft is a good app. So please get it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I honestly love this app. I have both the first and second temple run. I would recommend that you get this app.
B004JMZPJG|3.0|It's a nice case, but didn't fit my camera as well as I thought it would, however I will use it.<br />Service was good.
B00873GRU4|5.0|cant wait to finish reading this book, and very aptly named! Draw your own comparisons to our own society, and get lost in an amazing story!
B00578FKVE|5.0|Call me a fanboy, but I loved this show from the very beginning.  I was heartbroken when it was cancelled, and was thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime.  Just started re-watching it, and I am looking forward to going through both (tragically short) seasons again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I didn't think I would like it and avoided it on Amazon's free list for several weeks.  But it was in the top 20 on the 100 free list for so long I finally decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.  I liked both of the main characters.  The conversational banter was well done and entertaining.  What surprised me the most was the emotion this book stirred in me.  I really felt the highs and lows of the characters and their \\"love\\" story and I could not stop reading it.  It got to the point where I just stopped trying to fight it and stopped what I was doing to finish it because it was the only way I was going to get anything done.<br /><br />I can understand how maybe this book isn't everyone's cup of tea.  There was some poor editing in the beginning of the book and the \\"reality\\" of this happening is obviously farfetched.  I was able to read past those things because I felt the story was told well and the characters were well developed and likeable.  Although, I am often tolerant of poor editing and farfetched scenarios as long as the story is engaging.  This one was and it was all I expected it to be (fun fluff) and surprisingly emotional.
B009PLKPMS|5.0|I love the versatility of the band and the different sounds, and just their overall awesomeness. This is a great compilation
0486295559|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for a reading assignment. She has read the whole book and have enjoyed it.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|I found it to be two hours and forty-four minutes of blah. I kept thinking I should be folding laundry, emptying the dishwasher. Sigh, not so good.
B005LAII8A|3.0|This was okay and that is about it. Wasn't quite what I expected. I really had a hard time staying interested in this movie. Can not quite put my finger on the reason why. I had a hard time following this one. Just not my cup of tea I guess.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Well filmed and acted.  suspenseful all the way.  Brought me back to a begone time
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Worked well on beer and wine bottles.  Just follow the directions and it easily scores the bottles.  After practicing on a couple bottles, it was pretty easy.
B005S9EKCW|2.0|Having seen this in London, where a third of the audience fell asleep and it was cramped on too small a stage in Picadilly, I had hopes for this.  I was wrong.<br /><br />In the end result, the tiresome rather banal music continues without much of a rest for three hours.  On and on and on...variants of the same basic music in the same tonality with the same rather amateurish orchestration and arrangement.<br /><br />This is no West Side Story...not even close.
B001TODCII|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Liam Neeson until this movie. What a great movie and excellent actor. I am now searching for all his movies.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Wonderful movie, worthy of it's academy award nominations and win by the director!  A joy to watch and a surprise ending - what was the real story!?
0553801473|4.0|So far so good love this series- but I'm almost half way through and nothing really seems to be wrapping up so I'm worried its going to leave me unsatisfied in the end. Isn't this the last book or is there another coming?
B004M20YDU|5.0|I love these songs and how well most of them were remixed while keeping the basic music of the original soundtrack. The only song I truly do not like to listen to is Derezzed by Avicii. It just doesn't sound right at all. All in all, great for those who love Tron and electronic music
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Excellent movie - best I saw in 2012 - one of the few my wife watched twice - well filmed and crafted.
0307700879|5.0|When I read a book after watching the movie, I usually am surprised of what content was clipped or how certain characters were changed.  In this instance, the time between movie watching and reading was so great that many of the concepts in the book were lost from movie memory. In short, the book was nothing like the movie that I remembered - but that is only because I remembered little of the movie.<br /><br />Writing is anything but a weakness of this author.  Combined with a strong story, this book moves quickly through passages of great interest.  It is another War and Peace as it delivers us around a young woman's entrance to adulthood through war crises - which includes her own sexual issues.<br /><br />We are confronted by a lying titled patient who is not as described.  But, whose character matches well t he young woman's caretaker - friend of the father - who watches over her as serious concerns of her mental well being are at issue.<br /><br />The war often turns to love and ultimately could be conceived to be anything but a war story.  But, details of war and the accompanying injuries make this more than a light reading \\"chick flick\\" script.  This may be how the book differs from the forgotten movie.<br /><br />This is one of those books which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Many passages are dedicated to any of the four main characters.  With such passages come changes in style, concept and writing. The changes within it are great.  The story line weaves with these changes. It is a beautiful thing to watch.<br /><br />Although I forgot the movie, I doubt I forget this book.  Which makes me think that again the book is better than the Hollywood rendition
0805047905|5.0|I love this book, and I hate this book.  I love this book when I read it to my daughter for the first time in a week.  I hate this book when I read it to her for the sixth time in one day!  Needless to say, this classic is always a hit in our house.  Even though it gets tiresome (for me!), my daughter loves it, and we use it to help teach her colors and animals.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. I play on the Free Play to relax and challenge my daughters on the Time Trial. I feel that playing the advanced levels on Time keeps my mind sharp. It's the juice of Sapho.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very much enjoyed this movie which appeals to all adults about a historical event. Great acting by all and wonderful portrayal of that time period. Very entertaining
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of Grishams books. This story was very well done with a lot of twists and turns. Almost all of his books are lawyer based, but the main character was from a different angle this time, and as the story developed there was a complete turn around and a surprise ending. Very well done as usual.
0694003611|5.0|This classic board book is a regular hit in our house at night time.  My daughter has heard it so many times that she now \\"reads\\" it to her dolls even though she can't read yet!<br /><br />We also play games like \\"I Spy\\" with this book.  The illustrations contain many items that repeat over and over again, so finding the mouse or the clock on each of the colored pages is fun for her.  We use it for color recognition, vocabulary development, and now that she is older, for letter recognition too.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|There are games like this but this is one of the best. It's a thinking game and u get more awards as u level up.  It is a good way to waste time and anyone can play.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|For me it is hard to control music is alright graphics are good and I think it needs more time on the timer. Like the game however!!

B002RSDW8A|5.0|I have seen this movie at least a half dozen times now and still enjoy it immensely.  It inspired me to go out and read both the book it is based upon re Julie (same title) and the other book the screenplay is based upon re Julia, \\"My Life in France.\\"  I must admit that I liked the movie better than the book it was based on, but very much enjoyed \\"My Life In France.\\"  Perhaps this is reflective of the fact that, in the movie, I enjoyed the half that revolved around Julia much more than that of Julie.<br /><br />The basis of the movie is that Julie is going through some rough times in her life.  She's always wanted to be a writer, but ended up doing mind-numbing frustrating office work.  She can never seem to finish anything or come to much in her life, especially since she is reaching that 30 year milestone.  However, she does love to cook.  Hence the idea of cooking her way through Julia's massive tome in only one year and blogging about it.  The other half of the movie is about Julia and her husband as they go to France during the late 40's and how she comes to learn to cook and to write her first cookbook.  Plus the trials and tribulations of getting someone to publish it.<br /><br />Meryl is wonderful as Julia.  She moves, talks, and walks like her and the love between Julia and her husband (who works in the foreign services, which is where they met) is incredible and charming.<br /><br />I'm far less enamoured of the half of the story about Julie.  She tends to whine a lot and isn't very charming...at least by comparison.  I think if she had learned more than cooking from Julia in the movie it would have been a better ending.  There are hints of this, but it could have been emphasized a bit more.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend the movie, especially for anyone who loves to cook or read about cooking or watch cooking shows.
B009KG7EMC|2.0|Once again a large cast of aging action stars reunite for another assault on the senses. The leader of the pack is Sylvester Stallone as Barney. His \\"Robin\\" is the not so old, Jason Statham as Lee Christmas. That last name will naturally be worth a few jokes along the way.<br /><br />The film opens with Barney, his crew and his aging airplane (symmetry there) are sent to rescue a Chinese (I think) scientist who has knowledge of blueprints of hidden uranium somewhere in a Russian mine. Barney is a free agent working for the CIA headed by Mr. Church (Bruce Willis). Church sends Maggie (Nan Yu) with the guys as she has knowledge of safe cracking needed to retrieve the blueprints.<br /><br />An opposing cadre of really bad guys lead by Jean Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) also want the information so they can sell it to more really really bad guys who want to make some bombs. The movie directed by Simon West and written by Stallone never takes itself too seriously. There are plenty of inside jokes that those of us familiar with the actors and their movies will all easily get. Included in the action are Chuck Norris, a \\"lone wolf,\\" Jet Li, Randy Couture, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Liam Hemsworth (someone the younger generation will recognize).<br /><br />As I was watching the opening sequence of the boys attacking the compound to rescue the scientist, I kept thinking of last year's \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" and how that mission was quiet, well planned and stealthily executed. \\"The Expendables\\" is none of those things. It is however fun to watch at times no matter how stupid the story.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I'm a of Timbaland and Justin Timberlake, I feel that they've both grown as artist on this album, mainly Justin Timberlake. Great album.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Too easy to predict this one.  There were some cute moments, but all in all, just ok.  Room for improvement, for sure.
034580404X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all three books and certainly hope there will be a fourth one out soon!  I highly recommend the set, you won't be disappointed!
B005LPEILQ|5.0|I could not put it down once I started reading it. At a fit and trim 236 pages, you are introduced to the characters and the story line quickly and without bloated blather. There are no unnecessary words here, no long winded passages, it is a very economical book. Right away I was drawn to the main characters, well two of them. The other one I was mentally cheering for him to be murdered with extreme prejudice. Whether or not my wishes were granted... well you just have to read the book.  I will tell you which one I did not like, his name is Noah. One of the orphans.<br /><br />Well written, I understood the fantasy world he was painting, and readily dove right in. I am sure I am not the only one who gets into a character and immerses myself within the book, and unlike some Fantasy books I have read, I was able to do that easily. I was able to identify with Malik, and understand his motivations.<br />High in action, there are no dull spots in the book. Every scene flowed easily into the next, with no leaps of faith on the readers part.<br /><br />A straightforward book, evil is evil and acts evil. Good is good. No waffling. I like that. The antagonists are believable, and you readily despise them. Unless you are into the whole evil thing, then you are on your own. Do they get what is coming to them? Does my best friend Noah get drawn and quartered like I hoped? Read the book, enjoy the book and share that you loved it.<br />I thought it was great, a page turner from start to finish and executed very well.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The movie for my children was a fun light-hearted adventure with great characters.  For myself, this was a trip down memory lane watching all the references to old school video gaming.  Highly recommended.

B0007TKNIS|4.0|A wonderful story! An Andrew Lloyd Webber classic. The music is so spectacular! I'm extremely happy to have this in my collection.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I read this book in one night while on a weekend business trip. Sure the book seems to be missing a structured narrative but who ever said this is some rule that makes a book good or bad? Tina didn't write this as a thesis project for a Masters in storytelling. And it's hilarious, heartfelt, honest, and the follow-up life events of 30 Rock coming to a close and the birth of her second child serve as a kind of happy ending grand finale that answer all the questions she was struggling with in the big question mark of an ending that we're confronted by in this book. I love Tina always and forever. I've come to respect her even more after reading this.
1601251505|4.0|I really love the Pathfinder system. They know what they're doing and know how to cater to their fans. The system is like a streamlined D&D 3.5 (hence why this is sometimes referred to as 3.75) so if you are familiar with that version of D&D the transition will be smooth. The only complaint I have is that the books themselves don't feel very durable. My friend just had his binding rip out on his core rulebook. If they can do a better job on the physical quality of the book it'd be perfect.
B009X01C64|5.0|I just picked up my Amazon Kindle HD 8.9&#34; and of course I needed a case for it. I compared the different options and I opted for this one primarily for 2 reasons: 1. Price 2. It does both horizontal and vertical standing. I am extremely happy with this case. The Kindle stands up nicely and it does not fall down as some other cases seem to do. I've done both horizontal and vertical standing and have been able to use the kindle just fine in both formats. I really like the back hand grip that allows you to hold it in the air with one hand and use it with the other. Overall this is a really great case for a really reasonable price. Why pay more?

B000OLGCI4|5.0|I initially received the incorrect DVD; however, as soon as I notified the seller I was sent the correct DVD, told to go ahead and keep the original incorrect DVD and I was given a refund including shipping.  In the end I had two DVD's at no cost to myself, I would have been happy just to get the correct DVD and no refund.  This is definitely a place to buy from as they will make it right if there is a mistake.

0345349571|5.0|I am a history lover.  I have been for as long as I can remember.  At age 9 I was reading a set of Time Life books on WWII my father had.  I read them all.  I studied it at university and took my undergraduate degree in it.  Of particular interest to me, in no particular order, are the Byzantine Empire, Early Modern Europe especially the Holy Roman Empire and the 30 Years War, and the 100 Years war.  The book that ignited my passion for the 100 Years war is this book.  I read it for the first time in high school and since then I have read it cover to cover 3 times and gone to it to reads bits and pieces more than that.  I can't recommend this book highly enough for the fascinating insight it gives for the Late Middles Ages in France and, to a lesser extent, Britain.  If you are even remotely interested, you must read this book!

B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|Enter Comedown Machine.....<br /><br />\\"An insistent bass, a jagged twisting guitar line, scowling vocals\\" and enough energy to spare, with the Strokes, that's what you get as well as total irresistability.<br /><br />This is a bit of a departure from their original style that diehard fans eat, sleep and dream for but it is a winning combination which I feel will draw in even more new fans.  \\"Comedown Machine\\" is the best thing they've ever done since \\"Is This It\\". The Strokes complete their extreme makeover with a polished, 80's-style sound and produce their most enjoyable material in a decade.<br /><br />10 years later the band is still going strong and releasing a 5th album and with the original lineup intact. This offering has a tight, delirious almost bent psychedelic feel to it.<br /><br />I read...<br /><br />\\"Those Strokes ultras holding out for a cold snap in hell - that is, a return to the sound of the Strokes' debut, Is This It (2001) - may want to skip to track six. Short and sharp, 50/50 is a cheery punk rollick in which Casablancas's curdled holler winds the clocks back to the late 70s/early 80s cusp.\\"<br /><br />Comedown Machine opens with \\"Tap Out\\", which is such an eighties dance rager, pulsing guitar grooves and head-nodding being non-negotiable.<br /><br />Cuts like \\"All the Time\\" is fairly by-the-book Strokes, but tunes like \\"One Way Trigger\\", trigger the departure from the norm, strange but unique.<br /><br />`Welcome to Japan' has its moments, with Casablancas putting on his smoothest voice over a suave rhythm.<br /><br />\\"80's Comedown Machine\\" creates a lounging style, a slow moving ballad sounding almost like a cross between Beach Boys background vocals, Devin Townsend's \\"Qi\\" and a Beatles acid trip. Very cool.<br /><br />50/50 fast, short and sweet, the song contains a prominent guitar riff and distorted vocals straight out of \\" Is This It\\". This reeks of Strokes classic.<br /><br />\\"Slow Animals\\" sparkles with offbeat rhythms, haunting vocals and an upbeat vibe, a real toe tapper.\\" Partners in Crime\\" sounds like a band cutting loose and having a good time. The next track on the album is \\"Chances\\" a ballad that stretch the vocals to the limits, not bad but not great.<br /><br />\\"Happy Ending\\" is one of the best examples of the band's combining of old and new. It has signature guitar like you'd expect from The Strokes, but the multi-tracked vocals and poppy chorus set it apart from their older material.\\"<br /><br />\\"But it's the album's final track that is the most markedly different. \\"Call It Fate Call It Karma\\" is vaguely reminiscent of the stripped down, relaxed vibes of 'Angles' tracks \\"Call Me Back\\" and \\"Life Is Simple in the Moonlight,\\" but the production makes it sound like 1950s-era jazz played through a dusty phonograph (there's even an ever-so-brief trumpet note).\\"  Very eerie and sinister.<br /><br />That they manage to score far more hits than misses here is only further proof that the band's inevitable fade away is still a long time off.

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|How can you not give this box set 5 stars, this is a testament to Stephen Stills life's work so you know it has to be superb on all fronts. This is an acoustic wet dream.<br /><br />\\"Legendary singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Stephen Stills, has released more than 250 songs since 1966, some solo, others with iconic bands including Buffalo Springfield, Manassas and, most famously, with David Crosby, Graham Nash and Neil Young.\\" Contained on this new four CD set \\"CARRY ON\\", producers Graham Nash and Joel Bernstein in collaboration with Stills blueprint the remarkable and 50 year breadth of Stills' career with 82 tracks, 25 of them previously unreleased. The 71-year-old guitarist is content to let his work speak for itself with this glorious release. No Ego trip here, just pure talent.<br /><br />\\"The material is arranged in a mostly chronological order, weaving a rich tapestry of American music, following Stills as he spreads the waters of folk-rock in the Buffalo Springfield; country-rock, psychedelia, hard rock and soaring contrapuntal vocal harmonies in CSN&Y; as well as soul-moving guitar poetry in Manassas.\\"<br /><br />The set also contains a 113-page booklet with rare photos & special liner notes.<br /><br />I read...<br /><br />\\"There are several Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young songs including `Black Coral, which Stills and Young released as a duo in 1976. Other highlights including `No-Name Jam,' a song Stills recorded with Jimi Hendrix in London in 1970. There are also new live tracks, including the CSN song `No Tears Left' from a 1997 performance at the Fillmore in San Fransisco. Herbie Hancock, Eric Clapton and Maynard Ferguson all make guest appearances on songs.\\"<br /><br />No amount of touting of all the various versions of timeless classics can do this set justice. \\"Stills relies on the folk, blues, and rock that have always anchored him, so he never sounds like he's selling out; he's merely adapting to the times. And by not ignoring these flaws, \\"Carry On\\" winds up as a rousing, moving testament to a singer/songwriter/guitarist who often doesn't get the credit he's due.\\"<br /><br />When asked....How much regard do you have for your legacy? Stills replies...<br /><br />\\"Well, it's not for me to regard. Graham and everybody had their work cut out for them with this beautiful package. I had a roomful of tapes about the size of two garages, and someone had to go poring through them and find the best versions of [these songs]. Legacy is something you talk about when you are finished, and I'm not finished. To answer invites too much speculation about how much self-regard I have. Ask Crosby that, but not me [laughs]\\"....Rollingstone<br /><br />Often, Stills' skills as a guitarist are under appreciated a byproduct of being a cornerstone of perhaps the biggest folk-rock trio of its time but his virtuosity is present throughout \\"Carry On\\".<br /><br />A Sprawling Four-CD Career Retrospective...Amazingws, \\"Carry On\\" winds up as a rousing, moving testament to a singer/songwriter/guitarist who often doesn't get the credit he's due.\\"<br /><br />When asked....How much regard do you have for your legacy?

B00B69UQEO|5.0|\\"Depeche Mode's 13th studio album sure starts with one hell of a noisy, avant-techno surprise. But then Dave Gahan's quiet delicate vocal comes in by way of a contrast \\"welcome to my world / leave your tranquilisers at home / you don't need them any more\\". Is this a State Of Depeche Mode?  All the drama queens are gone,\\" he sings, \\"the Devil got this made\\". The track builds into a huge chorus refrain of \\"welcome to my world\\" as the noise keeps going, ripping and sounding very analogue with a pile of strings underneath.\\" Great start to a new era.<br /><br />\\"Angel\\" compares somewhat to a Chris Goss, \\"Masters of Reality\\" tune \\"The Eyes of Texas\\", nothing like Depeche Mode has ever sounded before. I love it. \\"Heaven\\" has a U2 lyrical structure which combines beauty and darkness which keeps you hanging on every emotional note.<br /><br />This is my favorite release since their \\"Violater\\" CD.  Love the style and the vocals are explosive.<br /><br />\\"Secret To The End\\" builds on the throbbing electronica and drum machine, lifting you to a plateau where Gahan's vocals capture you and antagonize you till the finale. This is a slightly bluesy cut.<br /><br />\\"My Little Universe\\" is a fractured percussive tune. We all know Martin Gore wants to take the spotlight at least twice in the album, once with his guitar and once with his voice.<br /><br />\\"Slow\\" enter the Blues-break we've been expecting, electronics that still dominate, but Gore's bluesy guitar riff is outstanding, and sets a sensual sounding mood that only Gahan's voice can back up. Great harmonies, this is one of the CD's highlights for sure. Excellent.<br /><br />The next three songs include a dark Playing the Angel type song \\"Broken\\", the typical Martin Gore sung piece of music c/w some interesting echo effects in the background , \\"The Child Inside\\" that appeals to a certain type of fan, a simple track, quiet but cleverly constructed, and the least impressive song of the album \\"Soft Tough/Raw Nerve\\", still a tough production  with rough backing vocals.  All this leads to the best song by Depeche Mode in years, \\"Should Be Higher\\", this is some of the darkest and most violent Depeche Mode material in years. All musicians in the band bring their A-Game in this song.  A true masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Alone\\" crunchy rhythms, Depeche Mode have resisted the urge to over-polish everything, which is good. It has worked for them in the past and so it does now.<br />\\"Soothe My Soul\\" may appeal to those SOFAD fans, this is a classic Depeche Mode track, they've really pulled it off here, and \\"Goodbye\\" brings back Gore's guitar as the main instrument in the song, his acoustic guitar is perfectly embedded in the electronics.  Both are good songs but pale to the superior \\"Should Be Higher\\".<br /><br />Overall, Depeche Mode give a fantastic performance throughout \\"Delta Machine\\", especially considering it's the band's first work in four years. After 33 years and 13 albums, the pioneering Basildon electro trio \\"Depeche Mode\\" are masters of a sci-fi synth rock blend.  \\"The whole thing melds together very nicely indeed, the songs are strong, the production is stellar, the blues theme is explored playfully but never overdone, and the songs are rich in layers that reveal themselves after repeated listens.\\"<br /><br />10 Stars easily, I've been waiting for this one for years.h production  with rough backing vocals.

0790729628|4.0|With more than  2000 reviews on Amazon at the moment, what more is to be said.  All I have to say is that the essential plot is an ancient one in films, but that is not a criticism. There are some nice views and many devices from, what would they call it, the age of noir? I could just see Mike Mazurki going into the saloon where Velma used to work (with Dick Powell whom he had just hired to find her) and tossing the bartender who came to stop him into eternity. Of course, Charlton Heston took a sci-fi shot at getting rid of the not wanteds, and........Nevertheless it was entertaining to see Harrison Ford at work although yet another scene on the roofs didn't exactly have the thrills it should have had as  the final confrontation (remember Edward G. Robinson and Orson Welles in the bell tower of a church and...............). So, as one who never had seen nor even known the film existed, all I can say to those others who  will know nothing about it save that it stars Harrison Ford, is that it is worth the slight cost of a used copy for it will give you a couple of hours of shoot-em-up, chasin'  'em down, and battered PI to enliven the evening. If I remember correctly, Harrison Ford even gets to kiss the girl.

It has quickly become one of my favorite holiday-ish movies, yet you can really enjoy it all year around.

You'll cry your eyes out, laugh till your lungs hurt, and no matter where you are and who your with you just won't be able to put it down. It shows you life death and everything inbetween.

I can't wait for the next novel.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|will review when i see the movie. i have been waiting to see this movie and know i will love it
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I have the volume on my kindle turned up to the maximum and I could not hear the alarm.  it was right by my bed.
B005JABU82|4.0|Freedom is one of my favorite mobile suit in the Gundam universe, so I had pretty high exception for this one. Overall, it's a great kit with amazing details as expected for real grade. However, being an older real grade, I have to say RX-178 MKII RG is a lot better than this one.<br /><br />My recommendation: If you love freedom MS, get this one. If you don't watch gundam and just want to get a real grade model, go for the RX-178 MKII.<br /><br />Warning: This kit is very hard to stand up on its own without an action base due to its huge/heavy wings. So it's suggested to purchase an action base along with it.<br /><br />Also, black panel line will look very dramatic on this kit. I recommend using gray instead for panel lining.
B00A0A6F7C|4.0|Great selection of songs and a great voice. Susan again displays her great singing ability and talent to sing a variety of music
1616550414|5.0|This book had my son and all his buddies reading instead of playing video games. Anything that can do that is a winner in my book.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Some rockers here but a pretty mellow cd. She is in fine voice  and her band is top notch as usual..
1452101248|5.0|The first recipe I made from this book was eggplant sauce for polenta. It's not corn season yet here, so I didn't make the sweet corn polenta that is on the same page -- I opted to bake dry polenta using the NYTimes method (1 part polenta, 4 parts water, salt, bake 45 minutes at 350F, stir in 2T butter and cheese of your choice, bake 15 more minutes.)<br /><br />The eggplant sauce was stunningly good -- really, really good. After I drained the fried eggplant, I measured the remaining oil. The eggplant absorbed only half the oil (1/3 cup), a pleasing result.<br /><br />This book is destined to be one of my favorites, right up there with Jerusalem a Cookbook and Food of Life.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|There is nothing to dislike about this CD! I played it at a party and people of all age groups loved it (from my 14 yr old niece, my mother, all the way up to my 71 year old grandmother. We were all singing along and we all knew the words! I would recommend this as a gift due to its broad range of listeners. It's a very enjoyable CD. Adele 21 is definitely a crowd pleaser!
0553801473|3.0|I hate buying a series that takes years to complete. This may or may not be the last book, as in reading the intro by the author he was alluding to another book to come.<br /><br />So far, it is a little confusing since the last book I reread was number 4, this is number 5, and I do ot remember all the characters and 5 is supposed to be going on at the same time number 4 was.<br /><br />I want to know how it ends so I will continue to read it but if you have not started yet, wait till HBO finishes the mini-series then you can buy the books.
B000001ESP|5.0|Every song is a winner. The cd that made Rush stadium rockers. If you like prog rock this one's for you.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Blade Runner: this is the true definition of a 'director's cut'...the cinematography should be used as a model for future film makers.<br />The movie bombed in 82' during Star Wars & E.T. era, became a midnight cult following to 25 anniversary extended showings at movie theaters in 2007. In my opinion the voice-over wasn't needed back in 1982 (channeling Robert Mckee).<br />Over the years Blade Runner has moved above 'cult' status
B00AREIAI8|2.0|very entertaining!! amazing graphics. very creative app. I'm very impressed with the creativity and clear graphics. very neat app for anyone who loves horses.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This specific white noise application has the best quality and variety of sounds and a great selection of settings I have found yet!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love this book!  It 's sweet, funny, heartbreaking, uplifting and it keeps you guessing.  Really a good read.  Worth the price.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|I am 84 years old and am a cowboy movie lover.  I really enjoyed this one.  Kevin Costner is a great actor. Thank you.
B007REV4YI|4.0|A scruffy and tired James Bond (with very few laughs) nearly kills himself a hundred times waiting for M to pay the ultimate price for her accumulated transgressions.  Very 21st century Scandinavian!  Much prefer Daniel Craig's CASINO ROYALE for being mean, lean, sexy and funny.  Even with all the angst this is scene by scene a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />The Blu-ray does not have a blended two channel track for a two speaker system.  The dialogue in many scenes is thus lost in the surrounding chaos.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|I am the type of person that will put a movie on and then a matter of minutes if it doesnt grab my attention I go to sleep. Well with this movie it wasnt action packed but it was very realistic. You could actually put yourself in their shoes. It was just an all around great movie and everyone I told to watch it loved it also. Watch it you will not be disappointed at all.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|If you're a gamer it's a great processor for the price. No need to jump to an I5 to play the top of the line games, this does the trick. Also, check out &#34;Hyperformance&#34; and how you can use the GPU with modern video cards to increase performance. This does require a motherboard that supports it but is great for most games (not all).
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this solitaire game! easy to use and I love what happens to the cards when you win the game.
B000002JEV|5.0|I initially bought this for the cut of Traveling Riverside Blues. I was pleasantly surprised to hear<br />great sound Quality and Zep cutting loose in a Studio like it was live. 2 Discs full of great music!
B0054W4JQK|5.0|Great to see a thriller with an original backdrop. A whole new approach to a particular kind of Amnesiac.<br />As someone who can't retain the memories she has accumulated and her position on the ladder during the day, she slips down the snake during her sleep and starts each new day where she began yesterday. Meanwhile her sanity is under attack. To survive she desperately needs to remember !
B00838HSYM|1.0|Does not wok in blu ray player. Will not play on region code USA.... Does not state that in description, so I bought a blank disc....
B0090X4GLW|5.0|The sound track is great and if you seen the movie it puts a smile on your face every time.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|without a doubt this is a really good idea. it has you in the beginning thinking &quot;oh this is easy. I just switch a few levers. cant be that hard.&quot; really? try beating lv18 on the industrial era one. good luck.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I was a little reticent to start reading because the plot didn't look all that inspiring. However, like Claude Monet, Rachel Joyce takes what could be quite mundane subject matter and finds pure gold to share with us.She made me laugh, she made me cry and she made me want to keep turning those pages....
B00B99KJR0|3.0|Love the game, would have given it 5 stars but I don't understand why they have to lock you out until you complete previous game.  I got to Day 58 and am unable to solve it so now I am done, cannot go any further.  Please allow player to proceed any 6 attempts
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|I agree with a previous reviewer's description of this movie as portraying Sherlock as on crack.  After 15 minutes, I couldn't take it anymore and shut it off before it were to ruin the books for me.
B000FC13E0|5.0|After reading the intro, I didn't know what to expect and a bit worried I wouldn't like where it was going. But it pulls you in and keeps that interest until the last page. Enjoyable!
B00BS4RGFE|5.0|I have loved Blake since his first CD came out, and this one does not dissapoint!  He just gets better and better!  Keep up the good work, Blake!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|Absolutely love this show.  I wish that it was included in Prime, $1.99 is a bit high for a single episode.  I have stopped ordering it and got caught up with the rest of the season through Cable.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|I'm new at book reviews; so fwiw.<br /><br />Author is good at drawing the reader into the main character's development so that you feel for him.  And it's good to unfold characters so to show vulnerabilities alongside strengths.  But one keeps wondering when the &#34;real&#34; hero shows up; and the real villain for that matter.<br /><br />I guess there are different expectations between those who want an ending to the story and a story which keeps on going for several books.
B007CEWR62|5.0|Secret Garden Winter Poem is wonderful I would recomend this to my friends.  I have several other albums from Secret Garden all them are great!
B005NKGEP2|2.0|The idea had potential.  Wife is CIA agent, husband a bank security expert.  Both need to keep secrets.  Unfortunately Pavone wrote it like a Hollywood, made for the masses, movie script where he frequently repeats the same things...just in case you might have forgotten that she needs to keep secrets.  Some readers might like this.  It wasn't my cup of tea...but then I don't go to multiplex movies either.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Love the case. However the elastic band is starting to loose its elasticity. But for the cost of the case it does the job!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was uplifting to see how a hard working young woman could turn her life around.  It is a novel, but a story that many young women could make come true for themselves.  I also enjoyed learning about flowers and their meanings.  It was an all around good book!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A very challenging game with great graphics and calming music. I had no idea of what to expect and found a gem. Looks great on the Kindle Fire.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|I don't why the songs have this drum beat machine theme going through them.  I'm trying to like it.  Still working on it.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I've read many reviews of this great album.  Frankly every song on it, most people don't agree, but every song is wonderful.  Many people diss Tapestry, the song, but listen to what it is saying.  You only don't like it if you have no imagination and you have never been a toad.
B009X01FJS|5.0|This is a Great case ! I  Love the hand hold in the back and love the way it stands up
B00BLCHL4Y|3.0|As it stands right now this show is very contrived and chock full of aweful melliw drama(much like the horrible adaptation The Bible). It's almost as if some soap opra writers got together to write this show. Also, the depiction of the Saxons is aweful. The Saxons were a close cousin to the Norse and thus cultural not much different. The depiction of them in this series is almosr 400 years advanced from where it should be. For a History Channel show, the \\"history\\" is lacking!
B00AEK9BKQ|2.0|This movie was recomended to me by a friend.  Why I have no idea.  He said it was good.  I think he just liked it because of the whole frontal nudity of Helen Hunt.  It was not a happy movie and did not have a happy message to send.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe is back! This is something fans have been clamoring for for a long time: An all acoustic outing from our favorite guitar hero. I'm proud to say that this album exceeds the hype. This album is some of Joe's best work in my opinion. Every song is great, there are skip worthy tracks. All of his accompanying musicians shine in their own right, and I thought their presence on the tracks added an atmosphere that is sometimes missing on his electric studio albums. Especially the fiddle, it just goes so well with acoustic folk and blues music. This is a must buy if you are a Joe fan!
B00BF124PC|5.0|Chastain is unreal... should have won the Oscar... if Bradley Cooper was in zero dark thirty instead of silver linings, I think she would have.. Katherine Bit slow maybe the the best there is right now... the greatest thing about the film was how authentic it felt... blows the hurt locker away in that regard. A Must own!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This is the worst excuse for an app that I have ever seen. I scroll thru stories on my newsfeed only to find them repeating over and over and over. you'd think Facebook would be able to come up with a kick asa app, not this one that SUCKS.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A must see. This movie will stay with you and will really make you think. Different than anything I've ever seen. Awesome!
B007SNYQFC|5.0|I am hooked on the Boldt/Matthews series.  As soon as I'm done with one, I'm picking up another.  Really like the way this guy writes..and I am kind of finicky when it comes to reading material.  If a book doesn't grab me within the first chapter, I go no further. Pearson holds my interest just like, Sandford, Grisham, T. Jefferson Parker, Michael Connelly, to name a few.  Good reads.
B00AEFXN46|5.0|The quality of the restoration is impressive, as is the new 5.1 mix. There a lot of featurettes about the making of the film and an audio commentary with Robert Towne and David Fincher.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I watched this movie, never having heard of it and not knowing what it was about, and I was totally blown away. I LOVED IT! I was obsessed by it. Realizing it was based on a book, I down loaded it on my Kindle and the book is EVEN BETTER! With the book, we're totally privvy to everything in Eva's head, a character who is so fully formed that I'm having trouble getting into any other book now that I've (sadly) finished this one. It's one of those stories where you just keep reading because it's so good, but finishing is almost devestating.<br />I reccomend this book to people who like a psychological exploration and who aren't so enamoured with motherhood that you can't see any possibilities to the contrary.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Quite different than I expected, but still thrilling. Loved it! Could easily watch it again and enjoy it. Great with popcorn .
B00BLGZN1S|2.0|I thought the plot was generally good.  However, the acting was terrible. The Soldiers that were portrayed were in terrible physical condition as well.<br />The purchase of this video should have been free.<br /><br />Fred
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Great Movie!! My wife and I enjoyed it! A lot of Love, and lost in this movie. A coming of age story about faith wisdom and friendship.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I'm enjoying this game. It's calming and exciting all at the same time (if that makes any sense). Glad my Milestone X / Droid X can handle it without glitching.<br />If Hemisphere Games starts to clutter this with ads I would downgrade my review. So don't do it! Lol
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great game!  Lots of fun for kids (and parents!) Would recommend to any age.  Not too difficult like some driving games can be.
0596805527|3.0|The book is very through, making it a terrific reference book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the way the book is written, there is seemingly no target audience in mind.  As an experienced programmer new to Javascript, I find much of the content to be 101 material I have to skip through.  Having just learned Ruby via The Ruby Programming Language by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto, I know the job can be done far more concisely.  And on the other hand, the book also delves into a level of depth that would make it rather daunting for someone new to programming learning his/her first language.<br /><br />Which leads me to my initial statement: great reference book, but whether you're a beginner or experienced programmer new to Javascript, could be better.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Such a sweet story , the music is fun, and the message is a good one. This is an all around happy movie, except for the sad parts.<br /><br />It's so fluffy I could die!
1907590099|5.0|Words are not even required. One of the necessary books for any psychonautic traveler. Highly recommend to anyone that enjoys psychedelics, even those who don't would enjoy this book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Honestly, if you're watching The Avengers, you probably know what you're getting into. Joss Whedon is an excellent director and writer, and manages to make the scenes carry the right emotions without being overwrought or melodramatic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I let my grandchildren play with my kindle fire when they visit.  My 5 year old granddaughter asked me if I had subway surfers.  I looked and got the app free.  She played it for 24 hours straight so I had to take it away LOL.  I watched and it was easy for a child her age but yet very challenging.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|My son has heard the awesomeness that is Queen, and wanted more of their music. I obliged. Does not disappoint.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The words bring you into the book to make you feel like you could truly understand what the characters are experiencing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so cool I love it I . Have to share with my little sister who likes Dora and even she loves it
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I lead the life of an adult these days and don't read as much as I used to. I just don't have the time. It's more uncommon than I like that a book can capture my interest enough for me to invest enough time to finish it. Reading twice is practically out of the question.<br /><br />I just finished re-reading this book. Again. This time I read the entire book in two sittings, reading away for hours. Reading late into the night, perilously close to that grating alarm noise that would signal my waking return to the real world.<br /><br />I bought this book on a whim and knew practically nothing about it. I was browsing shelves in a book store looking for something new and interesting. I was mostly disappointed with what I found and was about to walk out with nothing when I found this book.<br /><br />I doubt anyone will ever read this review as the book currently has 1600 reviews and climbing, but at least this will add a few more stars onto a deserved rating.<br /><br />My short summary : Buy It. Read It. Experience it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Thought I'd try this out so I could  show my son I am not completely an idiot when it comes to his favorite game. I was wrong.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|In my opinion this movie should have won the best picture Oscar.  It is not only visually incredible; but, there is such an incredible depth to the storyline.  It will stick with you for a long time.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|You can't watch this movie from a scientific, engineering perspective, You need to look at the human element, the message was powerful, the ending intense. Highly recommend this movie
1451695195|4.0|awesome reading, really makes you think there is an afterlife, Ive always been sceptical and after this it makes me think its true.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|I liked the first 2 MIB movies, and was not sure the 3rd would hold up as well. I was pleasantly surprised and am glad I bought it.
B00BHMF578|4.0|This was a very good movie; but, I don't think it was deservant of the top award at the Oscars.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This app is very helpful.  I find it very accurate when compared with local information.<br />Very easy to use also.
B0090EHVMC|3.0|Being a fan of the book, I was a little disappointed by the movie. It had it's moments and was enjoyable to watch. However I probably wouldn't watch it again. For younger kid this would defiantly be a great movie.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|This is such a classic I can't even tell you anything I dislike about it. Monty Python makes everything better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway serffers is really cool and I was so surprised antisocial it was because when I saw it I thought that it was going to be stupid.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the finest movies ever made. You have to appreciate the existential theme of the movie. The Dude's quest to redeem the rug that &#34;really tied the room together&#34;- what a great metaphor! The search for meaning in the face of oblivion is beautifully restated when mortality literally hits the Dude in the face. Sartre couldn't have framed it better. The Dude abides.
B005FITIIC|5.0|This movie is an excellent example of people in crisis. The dialoge and behaviour of all the people involved is beyond 5 gold stars. This depiction of the 2008 housing  crash should be mandatory study for all concerned. Beyond Excellent.  kh.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am NOT a fan of the show, but the family likes it, so they can now watch it to their hearts content, and I can watch something totally different!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I love this movie! This movie has such personal ties to me. My senior year solo was &#34;Castle on a Cloud&#34; and I fell in love with the musical then. After seeing this version, I loved it even more!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I play this and *try* to get three stars on each level before moving on.  But some are really hard to do that!  Bonus rounds being added are great.  But I will not spend money to get extra &#34;power&#34; or assistance, so that's a waste for me to see on my Kindle.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|a little different end of time story. I liked it very much.It makes you think of how government can fool you;
B000VHMF0A|5.0|A classic, Bob for the beginner is just enough to have good music at the shop which is not offensive to most anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this games is crazy totally wicked kick ass and shocking at times but totally fun<br />for all  ages big or small
B008TMA1LY|1.0|how you know you ask, the clock says 17minutes, and it counts down as fast as you can say the seconds.  you cant even get kitty to move fast enough to clean , make , seat or take money.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's Fab........need i say more??????  Well ok i will say just a little more...Its captavating. I love the characters they are full of life and personality. It keeps me interested, just when you think one thing is going to happen BAM!.....its something other then what you expected!  Love that!  Cant wait for the next season.
1401219268|5.0|I am pretty impressed that my nephew asked me specifically for this book since he has never been one to read for &#34;fun&#34;. That being said he loves this book and in turn, so do I.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love that this is not like your typical Disney princess film. Fun for all ages. A good time for the family.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|she loves this game so much, she lied about using the kindle in the morning, and was punished for 4 days, no tv, no kindle. no whining or being bad for 4 days, and on the fifth day, she says, my punishment is over.  she loves her poines
B004H6G0TI|4.0|I am enjoying this game however I am not sure if its because the game is fun or I just want to find out what the next airplane is going to do.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I *hate* this show, but my husband and family love it. I can leave the room and they can watch it all the way through, if they want to do that.
B005MMJ84K|2.0|Reviewed by Nyx @ unraveling-words.blogspot.com<br /><br />Right now I am thoroughly hating this book with a fierce passion. I had to keep telling my self to just breathe! In. Out. Deep breaths.<br /><br />Starting from the Table of Contents I already knew I was going to have problems, what with how the title of all the chapters were then and now. I would get all invested in one story line just to get wrenched out into the other. Then I would be too pissed off at the book for making me read something I don't care about for like half the chapter till then I'm finally getting the hang of the second plot line and once I'm invested again I get wrenched out AGAIN. And this goes on for like the WHOLE book. It was so bloody exasperating!<br /><br />Plot wise, I saw everything coming. It wasn't anything new, but like always what kept me going was the writing. I would just keep getting sucked in Every. Time. It was a vicious torture cycle. And the sad part is that at the end I don't know if it was even worth the torture.<br /><br />It wasn't even just the whole going back and forth that was bad. It was that I knew where it was going. (view spoiler)I'll be honest. I was kind of hoping for something different when I read Delirium but once this one started I just knew. I don't even know why I put myself through that. At this point in time I might not even bother with Requiem.<br /><br />You might be wondering, how could I not finish a trilogy with, not only is it just one more book but with that ending? Simply cause I don't give a crap anymore. Lena is going to end with Alex and I can't take Julian being left behind. I like Alex, but he just doesn't do it for me. Their relationship has always elicited an 'oh how nice' reaction from me. It was whatevers. But with Julian, I actually ended up being invested. He is so innocent and sweet and I know given half the chance he would be one hell of a guy. At one point Julian and Lena's relationship felt like Delirium all over again only Julian was playing Lena and Lena was playing Alex. But Julian is so much better than Lena. I still find Lena as that brainwashed person as before at times. While Julian living with that father of his and all the crap he went through, he was much more willing to accept change than Lena ever was.<br /><br />So yeah I will most likely end up not reading Requiem and just end with the self induced torture now than carry it over for one more book.Julian was playing Lena and Lena was playing Alex.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|after reading the first novel, I had to have the rest.  the second was almost as good as the first, but the third left a little to be desired.  Im awaiting the second movie.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I love Mark Twain and this book in particular.  This book gives one a peek into boyhood, the south back in the day and gives us a little thrill besides.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|How can you not love this album? It is as amazing as it has ever been and will not go out of style.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like the left/right scrolling. This app packs a huge amountbif information into a nice, easy to use User interface. I'm impressed!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I'm surprised more people aren't hooked on this show. It has everything you want in a great tv show. The acting is really great, the characters are very interesting. We love it. I hope it continues.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a country girl I love horses. it's the best app ever! !!! and you might ask yourself why not ?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I mean come on...it's Downton!  The show is amazing.  I love how it is something I can watch with my kids in the room.  The way tv should be.  You should really watch this show from the beginning of season 1 if you are going to start.
B009A87ZKG|4.0|This version is improved over the original blu-ray release, and honestly, I can't tell the difference, although reviews have shown the differences side-by-side. That said, the clarity of this movie that the blu-ray format brings is very good.  This is such a good, well done, and important movie, that having the best possible release was important.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|My 22 year old son and I love Castle! Season 3 was great! Can't wait for Season 4. Getting that now.
B00AX7PGQS|5.0|Not in the mood for analysis, though this film splashes a waterfall of possibilities, so I'll stick to gush. I've viewed it twice, registering excitement each time as I felt the pull of new interpretations and processed details ignored the first time around. Yet, this film is as much visceral as it is cerebral, a great deal of fun to watch and be captured by. I don't doubt I'll be going back to it repeatedly. Thinking of its proper ancestors, my thoughts turned to the two &#34;Jeans&#34; (Vigo and Cocteau) and Luis Bunuel, but cinematic pioneer George Melies is its truest primal predecessor. &#34;Holy Motors&#34; updates the magic lantern of cinema to our own time.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book!  Very interesting story with great details.  I would have to tell all my friends/co-workers this is a must read book.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|Not enough experiene to give an accurate review. Just joined last week and it was by invitation from a friend.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|I usually hate this type of movie.  I dont like feeling jerked around to be \\"moved\\" by the story.  This story engaged me early and held my interest to the very end.  Even slugging through the sub-titles wasn't too distracting.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|If anyone ever questioned Steven Speilbergs genius this movie will dash all doubts.<br />This true story set in World War II Germany is clearly a labor of love. A gut wrenching saga of one man who was brave enough to take on Adolph Hitler and to save Gods chosen people.<br />Bring your box of Kleenex. It is a powerful 3 hours 16 min.
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|There is very little, if any, that one could criticize about this CD set. This weekend at the Felt Forum in January of 1970 represents all that was/is pure about live music. It transcends the onslaught of all the failed attempts (for the consumer) at re-marketing, remastering and AAD conversions perpetrated by the music industry directed to it's dedicated customers. Going from AM radio to 45's to LP's to 8 tracks to cassette to reel-to-reel to CD's to digital media and back to remastered CD's - I still LOVE the music that played such an important part in my personal growth. And when it is THIS good I've come to LOVE it at a substantially greater/different level. Despite the fact that my parents literally locked me in my room that weekend in January 1970, to prevent me from sneaking to any of the Door's shows, it was a bonus to purchase this set and enjoy a truly unadulterated display of creativity. In my humble opinion the four nights are NOT the same shows but four separate performances each with it's own identity. An audiophilic Doors fan MUST HAVE. A &#34;must have&#34; for any fan of live/studio music. Pass the banner to the next generation. A symbolic and impressive gift to yourself or special one - Democrat or Republican. Considering the cost of a concert ticket, here your cost is $12.00 per show which is not much more than $5.50 for an Orchestra Seat at the Forum. Cost today for the Door's @ Felt Forum - Orchestra seating???? Some things are good enough to be true. P.S. I did pay $32.00 each ($26.00 more) for four seats which I consequently gave to my older sister (she didn't go).

B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with the new movie Les Miserables.  I expected a much more powerful result from the director of The King's Speech which is one of my favorite recent films.  I've seen the Broadway show twice, a few high school productions of it, and I've read Victor Hugo's book.  I've even played in an orchestra for a theater troupe that did Les Mis so I (like most of us) am very familiar with the characters, story, and the music.  One of my favorite musicals!  But I still nit-picked.<br /><br />First the good:  I thought the film's costumes were fantastic and the sets were very well done, though the wide-angle shots displayed some very unconvincing backgrounds.  Anne Hathaway's performance was by far the best in the movie; she certainly deserved that Oscar.  Despite being skeptic of Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, I was impressed with his performance also.<br /><br />Criticisms:  With the exception of Anne Hathaway, not a single character/singer put much passion into the songs - a critical element considering such a passionate story with passionate music.  I thought Russell Crowe did very well as long as he wasn't singing.  When the characters sang \\"One Day More,\\" I felt as though they were thinking let's-just-sing-this-real-quick-and-get-it-over-with, and the actress who played Cosette was killing me with the vibratos (it's not an opera, honey!).  Helena Bonham Carter was hilarious as she always is; too bad Monsieur Thenardier couldn't match her antics.  The dialog among the characters felt very jostled, as though they were always in a hurry to sing the next song - this resulted in a very odd pace and left the viewer thinking that the whole thing felt rushed.<br /><br />I will recommend this film to anyone who has never seen the musical and is curious of what all the hype is about (may want to first borrow it from the library or a friend or find it in Red Box).  There are also many other (and better) movie versions of Les Mis.  But to reallygain a full appreciation of one of the best theater productions ever composed, you really should see it on stage.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|EL James has so much repetition in the two books of the Trilogy I wandered if she ever had an editor. It was an easy read and I liked her ability to convey the thoughts of the young woman.  The constant repeated sexual scenarios got old fast. So did her repeated comments about how gorgeous the male character was. It lacked maturity and depth.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|In OneRepublic's latest album, \\"Native\\" brings a fresh new sound to the group's already impressive resume of music. Overall, the album is quite a bit more upbeat than the previous two. I absolutely loved the first two albums, and this one adds to that love. While [[ASIN:B000YKG5L4 Dreaming Out Loud]] and [[ASIN:B002WPVNZM Waking Up]] both had a few slower, almost melancholy songs, \\"Native\\" seems to have a happier feel to it. Even the slower songs on the album seem quite a bit more \\"full\\".<br /><br />The album starts off with a simple intro in \\"Counting Stars\\" that bursts into what has become probably my most favorite song on the album. Right away it's apparent that OneRepublic has decided to experiment a little with their iconic sound this time.<br /><br />As the album moves on to \\"If I Lose Myself\\" and \\"Feel Again\\" (The album's leading singles), the energy stays constant. \\"If I Lose Myself\\" has an almost club-like feel to it, while \\"Feel Again\\" sounds very much like the traditional OneRepublic sound.<br /><br />\\"What You Wanted\\" is a continuation of that iconic sound, followed by \\"I Lived\\". This song has an easy-going simple feel to it. I really like this song, as it has a wonderful message. The song is about making sure that you make the most of life and not let it pass you by. One line in the chorus line sums it up by stating: \\"With every broken bone, I swear I lived.\\"<br /><br />The album then moves in to \\"Light it Up\\". This song seems to be another experiment. It's a pretty catchy, new sound for OneRepublic. \\"Can't Stop\\" follows, also being a little different. This song is also incredibly catchy. I think the reason for that is the drum beat.<br /><br />The album slows down here a bit, with \\"Au Revoir\\" and \\"Burning Bridges\\". The first brings in the cello sound that I love and had up until now been absent in the album. The later starts slower, but picks up into a traditional One Republic feel.<br /><br />\\"Something I Need\\" is a great song that starts out acoustic and builds. I like the line in the chorus here that states: \\"If we only die once, I wanna die with you.\\" I really like the song that follows, \\"Preacher\\". It's hard to describe why I like it. I think that it's mostly because it's just an easy going song with a catchy beat. \\"Don't Look Down\\" was kind of a disappointment, but an understandable ending to the album, as it's just a nice outro.<br /><br />I got this album as a deluxe edition, so I don't know that the last songs are included in the regular version. \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" comes next. Admittedly, this is one of my less favorite songs in the album, as I just couldn't get into it. However, \\"Native\\" ends strong with \\"Life in Color\\". This song is so upbeat. And really is a kaleidoscope of sound. As I listen to this song, I can easily envision the colors that OneRepublic's music creates. It is a great end to a great album.<br /><br />Overall, I love this album. I have enjoyed the previous two albums, and this one didn't disappoint. The only think I wish OneRepublic would have done would be to incorporate the cello sound more into the songs. I absolutely love their use of the cello, and I missed it in their newest album. That being said, it is still a wonderful album that is sure to captivate both the long-time fan and the newcomer alike.and builds.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have alwasy love &#34;The Godfather&#34; and &#34;The Godfather part 2&#34;. They are great movies. Unfortunately, &#34;The Godfather part 3&#34; was just a way for Coppola to grab more money off the Godfather name. It should had never been made. If you pay close attention to part 3, it just a replay of the other two movies, without the great story line behind them. IMO, it's a toatal waste.<br /><br />The Blu-ray version is very good PQ. It's what these movies needed, specially after all these years. If you're a fan of &#34;The Godfather&#34; movies, you should get this Blu-ray. For me &#34;The Godfather is a movie I can watch over & over.<br /><br />I have one wish. That Coppola would release in Blu-ray &#34;The Godfather Saga&#34;. This was on tv many, many years ago...I believe on Bravo as a mini series, (before Bravo went to the trash reality shows.) It showed the story of the Godfather and Godfather 2, but in  chronological order. It starts in Sicily like part 2, and takes you all the way to where Michael takes over as Godfather. I can't remember if it takes you to Las Vegas and where Michael becomes so paranoid. But IMO, it's the greatest version of the Godfather that was ever made.(This was way before Godfather part 3 was even an ideal.)<br /><br />So get it and get a few cannolies to have when watching it...oh, don't forget, leave the gun, but take the cannolies!
0865479410|5.0|What is a self help book, especially if there is no self? Or more to the point: everything is a self help book, if you see the world that way. If it is all part of the journey, what kind of journey are you on? This book serves up many entries into the mysteries of life from and for a curious mind.  In some ways the title is tongue in cheek, because opposites are not boundaries but where things meet. Turning it this way and that, helps provide a fuller picture of a fluid and dynamic world. Where do we fit in? By not tackling the question of what is happiness head on, we are instead in conversation with a very smart and insightful friend.  Sharing stories and experiences combined with philosophy and psychology, we hear from others along the way.  He lays out the strands, building upon them and weaving it all together so that at the end of it, there is a shimmering and beautiful puzzle that is alive and constantly shifting.  What do you see?
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I went to see it twice at the theater! So I have eagerly awaited for the DVD to come out. Now I can watch it repeadly at home! It has some bonus videos. Two of them are interesting behind the scences with set design, the actors etc. I did not appreciate one of the videos about the Occupy movement....give me a break Hollywood, that was such a George Soros/communist party funded astro-turf &#34;movement&#34;. Very annoying, no wonder most people can't stand Hollywood as a whole.  If your able to overlook that junk, the movie is very worth it. Its wonderful that the hero, Jean Valjean, is a Christian and finds forgiveness and redemption in the end. The book is wonderful too!
B007WPM4P0|4.0|Interesting characters, settings very realistic.  But the plot transitions are not smooth and appear to leave out some of the detail.

1416955070|4.0|I just finished reading this book like an hour ago and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I stumbled upon this book at Walmart and heard mixed reviews over the book, I was kind of reluctant to make the purchase (It's very rare I buy books full price) but I have realized that this worth every full priced penny. I didn't expect to like this books as much as I do. It took me basically two days to finish it, I'm feening for the sequel to show up at my doorstep!<br /><br />I loved the style of writing, although sometimes her writing was too descriptive. I didn't like how she introduced so many aspects of the fantasy world at one time though, I was a bit confused at first. I had to reread some pages to grasp how this world worked. I also didn't like how predictable some things were, like the obvious love triangle and the fact that Valentine was her father way before this information was revealed. Also, I didn't like how I couldn't really see the some scene clearly because of how much of a mouthful is was to describe simple things. But other than these minor hiccups, I loved her style of writing.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Clary. She could have been written with just a smudge of more personality but for the most part I loved her. She is one of the very few main characters that I can read along with and not get annoyed with. I loved Jace, even though he can come off as a jerk sometimes, from the beginning of the book its clear that he cares for Clary and his family. As for the hostility towards Simon, its obvious that he's jealous. I loved the chemistry between Jace and Clary, I also loved the blooming feelings between Simon and Clary too. Even though its clear that Clary doesn't feel for Simon as he does for her, there is obviously a part of her that has feelings for him if she got jealous of him and Isabelle. Isabelle was an okay character to me but Alec, I didn't so much like. Alec wasn't one of my favorite characters by a long shot.<br /><br />The ending was perfect, it left plentiful room for City of Ashes to come in. The plot twist was praiseworthy, I was truly shocked by the outcome. So all in all I can definitely say that I enjoyed this series, I've already ordered the next four books after City of Bones.<br /><br />If you are a YA fantasy snob, don't pick up you will be disappointed at how many elements of books that have been entangled in this. But if you could care less and judge the book by the Author's twist of her own novel, read on!

030014332X|3.0|This book is an interesting general introduction to the history of the world, but Im not sure where it fits in.  Possibly too advanced in its casual mention of important topics for the novice, but a little weak for those able to run with its presumed background.  Maybe look at it more as a refresher.

B005LAIGPA|3.0|Chronicle, a 2012 Science Fiction film directed by Josh Trank in his directorial debut, and co-written by him and Max Landis, the son of John Landis, who was notable as the director of such films as Animal House and An American Werewolf in London. Chronicle is a found footage film, which is a genre typically reserved for horror flicks like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, but lately is being used more and more for other genres of films, this and the teen comedy Project X being prime examples. Anyway, on to the film itself, it focuses on three high school kids, Steve (Michael B. Jordan), who is popular, outgoing, and running for class president, Matt (Alex Russell), is an average kid who has friends and does well in school, and his cousin Andrew (Dane DeHaan), who is a loner abused by his father and living with a terminally ill mother. At the beginning of the film, Andrew is already carrying his video camera around as he feels the need to record his life. He and with Matt go to a rave together and meet Steve there, who initially approaches Andrew because he wants him to record them as they go into this strange hole they found in the ground. The Hole is emanating these weird vibrating sounds every now and then, so they go into the hole to see what's making the sound and discover this strange glowing \\"object\\" which appears to be either a large crystal or UFO of some kind that causes their noses to bleed and they pass out. The film then picks up weeks later when they already have discovered the use of their powers and are testing it on a ball. At first, when they get their powers they just use them to goof off and have fun but later on the film takes a darker turn, mostly because of Andrew, and it's of course understandable. Personally, I felt Chronicle was a good film simply had too many flaws to make a masterpiece or even a great film. The idea was relatively original and interesting,a bunch of high school kids get superpowers but instead of using them to do good and save people they simply have fun, pull pranks and goof around, at least at first anyway. The biggest flaws in this film were, to me anyway, the fact that it was a found footage film, despite containing obvious CGI effects, and how it was completely unnecessary for the film, it actually took away from many scenes for me. Also how the fact that they were so open and nonchalant about their powers, openly using them in public where somebody might see them and possibly report them to the police or the government, like the CIA perhaps. I might understand if it was after they discovered how to fly, but it was actually before they did, so if the police or military wanted to apprehend them so they could use them as test subjects or as secret weapons for the military, they definitely could. Yet all three apparently are too stupid to be aware of this fact until after Andrew starts going bad. Another thing I didn't like was the very predictable plot and the very \\"Hollywood\\" style ending, which is another thing that took away from the \\"genuine found footage\\" aspect of the film. Now there were some good points to this film, most notably the action scenes, the dramatic scenes involving Andrew's home life, and the depiction of Andrew's downward spiral from weird outcast to raging psychopath, in ordinary circumstances someone with a history of abuse and tragedy similar to Andrew would probably end up either in prison, crippled, or dead due after reaching his breaking point. However, when he does finally reach his breaking point he possesses telekinetic powers and the ability to fly, so that just makes it much worse, and much more interesting! Overall Andrew is a somewhat likable and very sympathetic character who you could tell wanted to be good but ended up the way he did because of all the negativity he was surrounded by. It happens all too often in real life, and that really appealed to me. Concerning the strange object, it is never explained what it truly is, andthat, combined with a scene towards the end which I'm not going to spoil, suggests to me that there is going to be a sequel, and if it comes out I plan on watching it, despite this being a so-so film for me, it intrigued me enough to watch a potential sequel, which is why it got a very appropriate 3 star rating from me. While this film was more of a Superhero origin movie, I feel the sequel is going to be a straight up superhero movie! I hope it gets made, and soon!that, combined with a scene towards the end which I'm not going to spoil, suggests to me that there is going to be a sequel, and if it comes out I plan on watching it, despite this being a so-so film for me, it intrigued me enough to watch a potential sequel, which is why it got a very appropriate 3 star rating from me.

B005S9EK5Y|1.0|Imagine my delight when my order arrived today. YAY! I could barely contain myself as I opened the package...an envelope rather than a box. I was a bit concerned about that, but there was no damage as far as I could tell. Everything looked fine. Well, until I opened the DVD case. Inside I find a small ad for Shop NBC and a very unprofessional disc. How unprofessional? Well...see how I said pirated copy in the title of this review? Even a counterfeit would have been better. This is not a studio disc...this is a golden Lightscribe disc with a Lightscribe label etched in. I honestly don't know if it works or not because there is no way I would put this disc in my system and expose myself to whatever virus(es) could be lurking therein. Thankfully, Amazon is accepting the return for a full refund (I would have liked to have gone for an exchange, but the initial offer would have been standard shipping and have taken up to a week to get here). The next offer was 2-day shipping, but who knows if I would have gotten a professional disc? I think at this point my best option is to try elsewhere, which is a shame.

I think he put a personal touch to the war, the good and the bad and helped me to better understand what it was like.  I've always felt that I should have done more as a soldier and it amazed me to discover that someone who has done so much more than I, could also feel like he didn't do enough.  After finishing the book I feel as though I better understand what he went through and how he dealt with it honestly and without glorifying war or violence, even though at times both are necessary.

It was really good, but I didn't LOVE it as much as the LOTR trilogy. That being said - this set has very little in the way of extras. There are movie and game trailers (who cares that much?) and some of Peter Jackson's video blogs. Video blogs do not a \\"making of\\" make. I would have liked some \\"behind the scenes\\" that were included in all the other LOTR movies (or maybe they were only included in the extended editions? I can't remember). Anyways, I wish I held out for the extended edition.

But when you're the boss, there is even less margin for error.<br /><br />When you start a new management job, you usually have a brief window of opportunity to make the changes that will set the tone for the rest of your tenure as a manager. Most companies no longer have a management transition program to help you; it is on you to make quick, correct decisions and get them implemented before your window of opportunity closes.<br /><br />Watkins provides a concrete framework that allows the new manager to organize his or her transition into the new position. The framework he provides may need adjustment for particular positions or industries, but Watkins' framework is always a valuable starting place and a good foundation to build on.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Sadly the only real drawback was knowing the final outcome. It moderated the final nail biting tension a bit. Great stuff all the same.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I recommend everyone watch this movie...it is a good reminder of what in life is really important.  I am glad to finally see a movie that stayed almost true to the book...so many movies made from books just do not do the book justice and the real meaning behind the book is lost in the Hollywood-ized movie.  This movie is a fabulous emotional journey.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World picks up where Mr Follett left of in Fall of Giants. As in his first book, his research into the history is impeccable. His characters are believable and interesting.<br />I really like this book (and the fist one, as well) and recommend it to anyone who has and interest in the 20th century and how the US fits in with the rest of the world.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|I watched this with my husband the other night. I loved it. He said after it got bad reviews but both of us liked it. I can't wait to watch this with my nephews and my daughter some day (she's only a newborn now.) I plan to buy this on blue ray to have in my collection. Great family movie or just great for the kid inside.
B003TNQEF0|1.0|This movie had horrible acting and directing.  At one point, a guy screams into the camera for what seems like 5 minutes.  Horrible movie all around.
0062014536|4.0|**I am trying to write this without spoiling anything but I might allude to things so read with caution**<br /><br />I am giving this book a 4 star review because it was a very good book, despite the ending. I have absolutely no complaints about the story line and actually, it ended the way I hoped it would. However, I'm still very disappointed in the ending. I feel like I've been cheated. Actually, the way the book ends makes me feel like the publishers forgot to add the epilogue. That's all this book needs, especially since it's the last one in the series.<br /><br />Everything I read and write myself, each action in a book, each character has a purpose. What I don't understand is introducing these things if they don't have that purpose. Grace had SO much potential to be something in this story. There was so much focus on her as a side character that I thought she would have a bigger role somewhere. But instead, it was like a balloon we're trying to blow up and accidentally let go as we take a breath. She just peters out. If it wasn't for Lena needing a purpose to do something while in Portland I'd say she was a worthless character and didn't need any mention in book 3.<br /><br />Raven was a side character as well that got a lot of page time. I liked her but I didn't love her. That's just a personal thing. It's not a critique. I thought she was very well written and was in the story just the right amount. Perfect ending. Sad, but perfect.<br /><br />Mom. I don't have my book with me and I don't feel like looking up her name. That's how I feel about her in the story as well, I guess. She's a bit character that as much as she was in the story after she was discovered to be alive she didn't need to be. I get why she's there. The whole idea of this story is fighting for love. It's not just romantic love but familial love, the love of friends, etc. Mom was needed to show that side, I guess. However, I think we had enough to go on in the first book when Lena remembers things her mother had told her. Mom was not a character I cared about when she came back. In my not so humble opinion she was useless. I would have liked to have seen her either have a bigger role in this book OR remained a memory to Lena of what she wanted to be like.<br /><br />Julian. Julian was another character like Grace. He had so much potential to be more and I started to see it happen in the fight with Alex but after it was over he figuratively disappeared. There was no chance for me to fall in love with him (I didn't in book 2 because I just KNEW Alex was still alive). There was no time while I read that I said, \\"Oh, Lena. Stop pining over Alex. Julian has given up so much for you. He's so good to you.\\" No. Julian was a very weak character in book 3. Actually I was getting more and more mad at Lena for leading him on.<br /><br />Alex was a completely different character than he was in book 1. I still loved him though. Think about a time when you were crushed by someone you thought you had loved. Is it fair that he told Lena he had never loved her? No. Probably not. But he was hurt. He wanted to hurt her as much as she hurt him. In his mind she had moved on to someone else and very quickly. Too quickly. He's right on there. Lena moved on fast regardless of the fact that she thought Alex was dead. How could she believe him though? If she had loved him as much as she made us believe she did she should have fought for him just a little harder. Then Alex moves even quicker to the next available girl? Sorry, in a world where love is so precious, this does not make sense to me, no matter how much Alex was hurting. Whatever. If this was the way Ms. Oliver wanted to write him that was her prerogative. I don't have to like it and it doesn't change my opinion that this was a very good series.<br /><br />Lena - what can I say about Lena. I have absolutely no qualms about this character. She was very well written. I loved seeing her change and grow throughout the books. We have to remember Lena was a teenage girl with no experience with love until now. Of course she's going to be confused, angsty, whiny, and mercurial. She has to learn how to deal with feelings she had been told all of her life were symptoms of a deadly disease. I think her feelings and reactions to her mom coming back into her life were very realistic and well written as well.<br /><br />Hana - I loved Hana in book 1. I loved her spirit. Toward the end of book 1 I figured she had been the one... It made me sad but it really made sense. I remember similar feelings of jealously when my high school best friend started dating someone. Her time with me was suddenly next to nothing. And, there is nothing worse than being a third wheel on a date. Reading Hana's POV in book 3 always left me with an empty feeling in my heart. It was heart breaking to see this firey spirit doused to embers. I hated seeing her written that way but it was so absolutely necessary. Absolutely well written, Ms. Oliver. Well done! I just hated her ending. No critique on it. It's just a personal dislike.<br /><br />I feel as if Ms. Oliver was in a hurry to finish the book so she could move on to something else and honestly, the comments I've seen from her, or her team, or her friends, or her family, fans who think they are more than just fans, have really been making me stew. In fact, it was a comment on Twitter yesterday that finally made me come to check out the reviews on this book to see if others felt the same way. Apparently they do.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned if you're reading on a Nook that it seems like you have 25 pages left. They are correct. I had just tapped my iPad to see how much of the story was left and was excited to see that was about the number remaining. I smiled, settled back into my pillows, and turned the page. My reaction was similar to that reader. Although, I think mine was more along the lines of, \\"Seriously?! WTF?\\" It was the first time I'd considered throwing a book (iPad in my case).<br /><br />Did you hate them by the time you finished? Did you want nothing more to do with them? Were you so desperate to write The End? I'm not upset at the ending as if I think it should have ended a different way. I am not wishing Alex took Lena into his arms and kissed her like she had never been kissed. I'm not even saying I want to know how the battle for Portland ended. The ending, as it is, is deflating. There is nothing there. It's like a sneeze you feel coming. Ah, Ah, Ah... and the choo never comes.. We have to remember Lena was a teenage girl with no experience with love until now.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|I have watched this movie four times and find laughs or sadness I had missed. I am in the age group of the characters and felt like I knew some personally. Especially, the negative wife of Douglas. I know too many people like her. I have read some of the negative reviews and hear her in some. NEGATIVE!!!<br /><br />We who are older like to see movies with all the laughter and sadness we experience from day to day. It was refreshing to hear and see seniors living and loving life. Life, with its ups and downs.<br /><br />I loved it and will watch it again and again.
B007Y612KA|2.0|If you can get past the incredibly over-the-top 50's cheese than you may like this movie.  Otherwise, I would stick with the real 50's movies that have actors and actresses that genuinely know how to act.
B000IKQMFO|3.0|Seemed like many of the subplots were utilized in Downton Abbey with more effect.<br /><br />It was difficult to feel connected to any of the characters and the plot really didn't start moving until the murder took place.  Seemed like too many characters and not a lot of development for any of them...hard to remember how they all connected.  Very few comedy moments and it seemed just like a rather melancholy film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Normally I read action books. To my mind this would not generally be placed in that category. But it is filled with action -- psychological and interpersonal action that I found riveting. This is a mystery involving the interplay of two personalities. I started on the first 50 Shades book mostly because I wanted to see for myself what everyone was mentioning. My friends and acquaintances did not really discuss it, just mentioned they were reading it and raised their eyebrow or made some other facial jesture. So I started it. Slow going at first, but then I got into the characters, which were very well developed and whose development continued throughout the trilogy. By the time I got to book three, I just could not stop reading. And the outcome is perfectly plausible given the growth of the two main characters. Will you enjoy it? That I cannot guarantee. But I sure did.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series. My daughter bought Season 1 for me. I wondered why she thought that I would be interested in a series about Zombies. Then I watched and loved the characters and the suspense. I bought Season 3 on my Kindle because I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I love using this with my Nikon D3000 to get pictures to my iPad.  The other reason I have this is to work with my Vestex Spin v1.  Pretty cool to mix with my iPad versus me having to whip out my laptop to do a quick mix session.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are the only headphones I like. I'm buying four pairs because they are becoming harder to find. These are super lightweight. The sound is better than I expect. I can't wear earbuds & I don't like cushioned headphones. These fit right in my ears and gets the job done when I'm listening to music on my mp3, ipad or phone.

0879309210|4.0|It's a classic repair book, but for a reader with average mechanical skills it's a bit too verbose at points.  Just tell me how to fix something - I don't need a history lesson, or 20 different alternate ways to accomplish a task.<br /><br />For all of that, it's a very good resource that will pay for itself with one neck set-up, pot replacement, or similar repair.
1400067820|4.0|Totally ok! No problem at all. Received the book in good shape as it was disclaimed. No delay and good vendor
B0042UEU8M|5.0|This movie was fantastic.  As a movie viewer, I love to witness the deeper meaning and receive the coded messages in movies.  This one was awesome for me to watch! Very healing as well!  Good job Zac Efron and lady actress.

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This one of the best video games ever. I think this is a great way to beat boredom . And I wonder if there is a three coming out that would be awesome .
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Once I started I couldn't put it down. The narration, the visual imagery, the emotional ups and downs and the twists in the story, everything was captivating. The world that Collins created was magical yet plausible to a point where the thought of our society ending up like this creeps in to your mind. I specially enjoyed that the romantic aspect of this story was secondary to the truly important and urgent social themes. I really recommend reading the books, I'm sure the movies are and will be great but they can't give the whole experience or touch every theme and character that the books give.
0061122416|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time...It is so well written,  a very short read!, you can finish it in one sitting. But there is so much depth and it is so inspriing! Once you start it you won't be able to put it down. I read it at least a couple of times a year when I need to feel motivated.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|My daughter loves Hello Kitty, but I hesitate to let her play this, since it makes her want to purchase more and more.  They make it too easy to purchase extra.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|We have two little ones (3 and 7 months) that both use a sound machine to help their active personalities relax at night in their rooms.  This solved the problem of having to bring one when we travel (especially at night in the hotel), since we always take our Kindle everywhere anyway.  My daughter likes to play with the app just for fun too.  You can play several different sounds at a time and turn each individual sound louder or quieter to custom the overall sound.  There have to be close to 50 different sounds I'd say.  They range from rain, storm, wind sounds (normal ones), to cat purring.
6305128952|5.0|This is a movie about the struggle of a young girl and her mother and of course the love of horses. Watched this movie when it first came out years ago and loved it then . If there is someone who needs encouragement to get past a struggle this is your movie.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like it. But I wish the gems wasn't so hard to get. But it was free! so no complaining here?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The last book in the Hunger Games series is certainly not the best. I felt like large themes that were central to both previous books were just dropped with no explanation in this book. This book was a bit too violent and gory for my taste. I understand how it fit into the story but it was disturbing that someone could devise such atrocities--real or imagined. I know true inhumane atrocities occur daily; perhaps the thought of it happening in this country made me uncomfortable.
0374533571|2.0|I was looking forward to reading - finished it in one sitting, thought it had to get better.  Never did -  boring  didn't care about the characters at all.  Felt  tons of compassion was characters in ROOM and HEFT.  This was a drag
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|I read this after reading Eckard Tolle's books.  Ruiz uses much simpler language to describe the negative effects of the collective unconscious.  The ideas in the book also align with Brene Brown's books on vulnerability and courage.

B00846REIS|5.0|Could not put it down, read it in two days!! Great plot and lead into the loves if the characters, leaves you wanting more
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|It was very well written and cast. It has vivid scenes of brilliant color that make it a beautiful movie to watch, and moments that stir every emotion throughout the movie.I was captivated by the journey and the ocean was as much a lead character as Richard Parker, the tiger.  It had twists and turns that I never anticipated and can honestly say that this movie was an experience that moved me to tears.  I's not for the faint hearted.  The ocean is relentless in being both friend and foe.  If you're looking for an experience of a most unusual story and cast of characters, this would well be worth your time.  I'm still thinking about it days after seeing it.  It's rare for me to be so moved by a movie.  I like it very much but doubt that I could ever watch it again.  Knowing the story makes it a once in a lifetime event for me.  It's captivating and powerful.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|AMC has done it again!<br /><br />Not just a zombie show but a great drama.  I'm not into the whole &#34;zombie genre&#34; but I found this to be much more.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to understand the opposite sex.  There are moments where each character is transparent and reveals the frailties of longing to be loved and accepted.  This movie is about their individual journey in search of love.  It's funny, insightful, entertaining and romantic.  Jeff Bridges is a good romantic lead. He and Barbra have great chemistry on screen.
6305907145|5.0|First of all I love this story and I liked the pace of the storytelling in this movie.  Frances O'Connor was excellent.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|The story and characters held my attention and kept me involved in the lives of the lead characters.  I wanted to skip ahead and find out exactly what happened because I cared about the lives of the people in the story.  There were surprises and very touching moments that brought me to tears.  I recommend the movie to anyone who loves the ocean because there are incredible scenes where the ocean is the lead character.  Facing and understanding fear, as well as overcoming fear, is a central theme in this movie.  For me the movie was more of an experience than entertainment and that's what makes it worth watching.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really enjoy it a lot, STRESS RELIEVER! My hole family enjoys playing it, I really recommend it for all ages appropriate.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this tool because it gives just the right amount of detail. It covers all the different uses and how much battery they will take.

B008B68J2G|4.0|This is the newest edition to the monster high franchise and I must say that this is a very cute,bright and trendy set. It is very well packaged which requires very little set up. It does contain a few small pieces such as the food and tableware. Just like any monster high accessory this is very well detailed...for example the table looks like a huge purple spider web which is actually cute and trendy. My daughter loves this set and was happy to add it to her collection.

B000W44IZW|4.0|I bought this DVD based on the fact I loved &#34;The Fifth Element&#34; directed by Luc Besson; and due to the rave reviews some people posted.  It's good, but not the awesome, mystical, life-changing movie (for me) that some found it to be.
B007MDB71O|4.0|\\"John Carter\\" is a 2012 film version of the first of the eleven books of Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic Martian series. This review is based on watching the film at home on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />When the people who produced this decided to bring out a film version of a book which had first been published almost exactly a hundred years before (\\"[[ASIN:1435134486 A Princess of Mars: John Carter of Mars, Book 1]]\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs was first been published in serial form in 1912 as \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\") and which had enormously influenced a great many subsequent sci-fi adventures, they must have known that there was a risk of critics and audiences saying \\"We've seen it all before\\" - because they had seen films and read books which shamelessly copied from Rice Burroughs' ideas.<br /><br />For exmple, Luke Skywalker's battle with the Rancor in \\"[[ASIN:B002TLT5QS Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1 Disc) [DVD]]],\\" and the similar scene with his parents and Obi Wan Kenobi in \\"[[ASIN:B00005RDPR Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones [DVD] [2002]]],\\" and indeed, just about every scene in a Science Fiction or Fantasy adventure in which the hero and/or heroine have to fight for their lives in front of an audience against huge, strange and terrifying monsters, are pretty much plagiarised from a scene in \\"A Princess of Mars\\" which is reasonably faithfully reproduced in this film with the credit (or blame!) finally going where it properly belongs.<br /><br />Sure enough, when it came out this film had mixed reviews from critics and some of the flak did appear to be accusations of a lack or originality, with one critic calling the film \\"derivative\\" and another saying that \\"everything in the movie has been done so many times before, and so much better.\\" A slightly more positive comment along the same lines was that \\"just about every sci-fi/fantasy/superhero adventure you ever loved is in here somewhere.\\"<br /><br />Even allowing for the fact that this particular criticism was rather unfair, there were a lot of critical  raspberries, and this film didn't do too well in the US box office. So when I rented this and sat down to watch it with my family I wasn't expecting anything too special, but we were pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Edgar Rice Burroughs' tale of a Confederate Civil War veteran miraculously transported though space (and possibly time) to the red planet which we call Mars and its' inhabitants call Barsoom was created on film with a fair degree of respect but without taking itself too seriously. The airships of Barsoom, the giant green Tharks, the great cities of Barsoom, the heroic John Carter (Taylor Kitch), the brave and beautiful princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Colins) and even Woola, Carter's loyal calot, (a Barsoomian creature the size of a shetland pony who acts like a dog) - it's all here.<br /><br />The action in the film flowed reasonably fast, the characters were well presented and there was some quite good humour.<br /><br />It's not the most brilliant film I've ever seen and the mixed reviews demonstrated that not everyone liked it, but my family did find this entertaining. As mentioned \\"A Princess of Mars\\" was the first of eleven Barsoom novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs: if the creators of this film ever manage to get the finance to have a go at making film versions of any the remaining ten books I will certainly watch them.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|It's crazy how much this things helps steady moving shots.  Works as described and at a great price.  I've got a camera T4i mounted on it, just far enough up to be able to open and close the view screen, and I've got a microphone mounted on the top bracket.  My only small complaint would be that it's a very tight fit with my battery grip attached.  I can make it work by pulling up on the top bar, but adding an extra half inch or so to make it fit better with the battery grip (which is very useful if you're shooting video, of course) would be nice.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Fun movie for everyone! I could even see another movie in a series.  Was a little predictable but still a great choice.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Its been a long time since I have seen schindlers list and didnt even realize Liam Neesen was the main star! Its a great movie about the holocaust. Recently on yahoo news the little girl in the red dress was ashamed of being in the movie during her childhood until she understood the meaning of Schindlers List.
B00B2064IY|5.0|i am a huge Jimi Hendrix fan and was salivating when I heard this one was coming out, some great new tunes and great versions of old tunes! Almost caused a flashback!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I had no problem getting into the book and then could not put it down. Grisham brings this story to life. The characters are believable and not forgettable. The story itself is uncomplicated with so many characters that you can't remember who's who in the story. It just reads smoothly and effortlessly. I love books that flow like this. Isn't that what reading is all about? I'd definitely recommend this book.
1423140605|5.0|I haven't had a chance to read this book yet. My son swiped it and finished it within a few days. He loved it. Another hit for Rick Riordan.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Delta Machine is a fantastic piece of work.  It's probably the most \\"electronic\\" album since Violator with a hint of Blues flair.  The production quality of the album is fantastic....rich bass tones and crisp unique synths.  It's hard to pick out which song is my \\"favorite\\" but Sooth My Soul, Angel and Heaven are most definitely stand outs.  Every time I listen to it, I have another another album that is in my top list of tracks.  The Deluxe CD is a must have!!  It's a hardcover book with great Anton Corbin photographs and the CD's tuck into the front and back.  Really looking forward to the new tour as these will be a nice addition to all the classics they play.  It's a wonder and unique album and I have to tell you....Dave has NEVER sounded so good.  The boys turned out another fantastic album!
B00B23O96A|3.0|Since the beginning of the 2000's Eric Clapton seems to be in a nostalgic and collaborative mood when it comes to his studio work.  He's been going back to his roots, working with artists who he admires and who have influenced him, and he's also covered some of his favorite songs by other musicians.  That his new album 'Old Sock' contains only two original songs among its 12 tracks shouldn't be surprising.  What threw me off is how after hearing the bluesy groove of the first single 'Gotta Get Over' how the rest of rest of the album seems to de-emphasize the very thing the made Eric Clapton the legend he is.  The most surprising thing:  It doesn't mean this album is bad, just that it may take some getting used to.<br /><br />Eric Clapton will be 68 years old on March 30th, and at this point in his life, he's long since stopped caring about making music for the charts.  As was the case with 2010's 'CLAPTON', a lot of reviews stated he sounded lazy, lacked fire, where was the guitar playing?  While Clapton's work will always be indebted to the blues, he no longer feels like a slave to it, so those fans who loved the long solos of Cream or Derek & the Dominoes will be highly disappointed with this album.<br /><br />There's a heavy reggae flavor to 'Old Sock', even though Clapton does perform some blues (Goodnight Irene, Still Got the Blues, Gotta Get Over), country (Born To Lose), or the American Songbook (All of Me, Our Love is Here to Stay).  Of the 12 songs, 4 of them ('Further On Down the Road', 'Til Your Well Runs Dry', 'One and Only Man' and 'Every Little Thing') definitely harken back to his #1 smash cover of Bob Marley's 'I Shot the Sheriff' from 1974.<br /><br />I listened to this album while on vacation visiting my dad in Florida, and the album sure fit the environment, sitting by the pool, sun shining, having a beer.  I definitely got 'Further On Down the Road' stuck in my head.  'Angel' which features J.J. Cale. sounds just like a song Cale could have recorded back in his 70s heyday, since Clapton's voice sounds so much like his.  'One and Only Man' features some nice harmonica and bluesy vocals.  In fact, Clapton's voice is one of the album's strengths.  His singing has actually improved with age, because he doesn't try to overdo it.  It has a whiskey soaked quality to it.<br /><br />'Goodnight Irene', a song Clapton did live on tour as a closer to his shows in the early 80s, features some excellent slide guitar work, and his heartfelt tribute to fellow British blues legend Gary Moore ('Still Got the Blues') features some excellent organ work from Steve Winwood, and a nice understated guitar solo.  'Gotta Get Over' is the best song on the album, the one rocker, and features some great wah wah guitar soloing from Doyle Bramhall II.<br /><br />While I can respect Clapton's wish to do some standards, those songs are the weakest on the album.  They're performed well, but 'All of Me' has been a little overdone.  I would have liked to have seen him do a few more rocking/bluesy type tunes, which would have given the album a little more kick.<br /><br />One of things I respect about Eric Clapton and why I'm such a huge fan is because he sticks to his guns and performs songs he likes to play.  The fact that he doesn't care about chart success speaks to what a lot of todays musicians only hope to have:  total artistic freedom.  Hopefully the blues hasn't totally left him, maybe a Muddy Waters tribute or a collaboration with Buddy Guy might still happen.<br /><br />Clapton has already announced that he will stop touring by 2015 when he turns 70.  From the concert reviews I've seen, he can still really cut loose when he wants to.  We should enjoy him while we can.
0553801473|5.0|This is my first hardback book of the 'Song of Fire and Ice' series, and I was thrilled to see maps of Westeros on both the inside and back covers. The jacket and cover have nice gold embossed detail and it just looks so inviting to dive into!

B0093BUWGE|5.0|In a time that artist come and go this CD is a much needed change to the game. There are few times that I would hear a current CD and go back to find an artists previous recordings. This CD is one that I would recommend to all of my friends if you want to hear good music that you rarely hear on the radio this CD is for you.

B005HEVBGG|5.0|I remember when Voyager came out, but life got in the way so I wasn't able to watch very many of them. I'm a fan of the original show, so it's hard not to make comparisons; so for me it's not as good a the original, but it is still good. They did a good job of starting to develop the characters.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|WORKS GREAT AND TOTALLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. FAST AND EASY TO USE, NO HASSLES OR DIFFICULT INSTRUCTIONS TO FOLLOW. A+
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book had a lot of great qualities. Some very endearing characters, humor, sorrow, an unexpected twist and even a little suspense. I was a little nervous before I started reading that there might be some Irish dialect that would slow me down, but this was not at all the case. It was a great leisurely read and I wished I could have kept reading!
B000RZIGVS|4.0|Ordered the product on 3/13/13 and it came in on 3/20/13, in great condition, all of them are in the case, only one was loose in the package and none have scratches! So now all I have to do is watch them! I'll rate again after I watch the series!

B0028MBKVG|5.0|A lot of hyperbole in this but the story about feet and the industry built on them is quite fascinating.  I'd love knowing what's happened the residents of those Copper Canyons and whether they are able to maintain any of the lifestyle they once had.  Which I had started earlier with the notion of minimal foot ware.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book... smart, informative and (for the genre) a page turner.<br />You'll enjoy the lucid presentation. I did.
1250007208|5.0|Ok i'll admit I put off this book for way too long, It sat on my TBR for months and months, and constantly got pushed back for one reason or another, but there are always those books that you push back and back, and then finally read and are like WHY THE HELL DID I WAIT SO LONG TO READ THIS BOOK? well, that was how I felt about Cinder by Marissa Meyer. I myself tend to avoid hyped-up books for as long as possible, because I never seem to enjoy them as much as everyone else does, but this was definitely not the case at all.<br /><br />Cinder is a fairy-tale retelling like none other. I haven't read to many fairy-tale retellings, and I really highly doubt that any would take cinderella and make her into cinder the bad-ass cyborg version. I thought this book was going to be a let-down for me, or that I wouldn't be able to get into to the story, but i honestly LOVED every minute of it. Marissa Meyer is a brillant writer, and had me engaged from the very first page, defintely going to be one of my favorite reads of 2013, and now I cannot wait to get my hands on a copy of Scarlet, and at least I don't have to wait because it's already out (another good reason to sometimes hold off on hyped-up books).<br /><br />If Scarlet is anywhere near as good as Cinder, Marissa Meyer will be one more author I add to my growing list of authors that are on auto-buy for me.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Love this doll!!!! So much fum to play with! A working bow with plastic arrows that actually can shoot them. The only problem is that her arm cracked and came out of the socket. My child is careful with her toys so I am not sure if this is a manufacturers defect. She fixed it with fancy blue duct tape and is still happy with this doll. If anyone else has had a problem with the arm, please post it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Great movie, Daniel Craig may not be the closest representation of the bonds but the action and the plot is superb!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Hands down amazing movie. Well worth watching, especially for those who like the Lord of the Rings movies. Though you don't have to see those to see this one, since after all the Hobbit did come first. Can't wait to see what they do with the next two parts. And note no i have not read the books, so i can't tell you how accurate that is.

B008X6N1OA|4.0|I bought this movie for my 2 year old nephew since he loved the previous movies in the series, he loved watching it but not quite as much as dawn of the dinosaurs. The series is still a lot of fun and overall a very good family movie, I really enjoyed watching the special features but I do need to  watch it in 3D to see if that will bump my rating up a star.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I saw the movie on DirecTV and it was so perfect and amazing that I ordered the 3D bluray just so I can rewatch it over and over again. In 3D its like looking through a window into a land of awe. Especially with the Cinema Smooth feature on Samsung TVs. Some people have been saying its just a musical. This is incorrect there are Orc encounters e.c.t.. where the group of adventures have to battle. There is a bit of back story on the wizards of the land and it helped me better understand The Lord of the rings series.<br /><br />I have never felt that a movie was so good I had to order it to rewatch it over and over again. It's a fun movie though but does have some adult language so if your kids aren't allowed to say certain words or you keep them away from such words I would screen it first and note at what times foul language is used and cover their ears over those parts. But it's a legit movie things aren't said out of context.

B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Soon after a holiday to India I read Shantaram. This story took me right back into the heart of Mumbai and revealed to me everything I wanted to know about India. Due to only spending a short time in India (ten days), I returned home with many questions about the place, people, culture, lifestyle, etc. Shantaram answered those questions and left me with a desire to visit Mumbai again. It is without a doubt the most extraordinary novel I've ever read. Gregory David Roberts is a master storyteller - he gets so many emotions stirring. Although I don't agree with his philosophies, the storytelling is phenomenal and the portrayal of India is dead-on. I love this book - its my favourite and I consider it a literary masterpiece!
B00B23O96A|4.0|Eric Clapton made no big promises about this album; it is a collection of songs that he enjoys, nothing more. Unlike previous big studio releases, this album maintains a frequently mellow pace best enjoyed over dinner or as background music. If you enjoy Clapton's music on a frequent basis, this is a fine investment. However, if you are looking for notable albums, the past will suit your interests better.

0783229364|5.0|This film has quite a bit in its favor. Cast,visuals,musical score. And Michael J. Fox,what else would be needed ?
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Critics, particularly American critics, never really \\"got\\" Depeche Mode, did they? How else to explain the basic lack of respect that colors even the more favorable reviews? (Don't believe me? Check out the Rolling Stone review, which reads as though someone wrote it in five minutes before hurrying off to lunch.) Meanwhile, the band has always carried on undaunted, selling out arenas around the world and making rather shockingly consistent albums for their faithful fans.<br /><br />Which brings me to Delta Machine. Here I am, listening to the 13th Depeche Mode album (8th in a row that I bought on the day of its release, old habits die hard) and wondering what to make of it. There's no way I can be objective about it--and if you're reading this, chances are, neither can you--so I will simply give you some of the thoughts that went through my head while I listened to it for about a week.<br /><br />1. I did not love this album on first listen, but...<br />2. I'm definitely enjoying the hell out of it right now.<br />3. Quality-wise, it's overall more consistent than the last three albums.<br />4. It doesn't contain a world-conquering single like It's No Good or Precious, or even Dream On, but...<br />5. Who gives a s***?<br />6. It does have very interesting production, constantly surprising me.<br />7. Mastering is better than on the last two albums (hallelujah!)<br />8. Lyrically, it's business as usual, meaning: sex, suffering, obsession, loathing, more sex (and possibly midgets, where's the lyric sheet...)<br />9. The album is nose-heavy with slow songs, but this no longer bothers me.<br />10. Somehow, Heaven sounds even better in the context here.<br />11. Come to think of it, so does Angel.<br />12. There's nothing as irritating on here as Breathe off Exciter (yay!)<br />13. Martin's vibrato sounds a bit nutty in places, doesn't it?<br />14. Notice I haven't even mentioned Alan Wilder?<br />15. Overall, there's an intriguingly coiled quality about this album, like it's waiting for you to relax so it can hit you on the head with a blunt object (yes, that's a good thing.)<br />16. Dave and Martin sound like they actually like each other. (Don't worry, the upcoming world tour will set that straight.)<br />17. Seriously, what DOES Fletch do in this band?<br />18. I refuse to rank this album among other DM albums, because... well, see #5.<br /><br /> There you have it. Hope this helps.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|It help me to see that there are people who are willing to offer help and not worry about color or race.<br />I rated this movie with 5 stars because I went through all emotions.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|David Gahan's voice is still strong.  This definitely feels like a darker, perhaps a little slower record, than some they have done in the past.  Lyrically, there is no different of a theme than has been in past records.  Tainted love (no pun), and damaged souls... sometimes coming across as a little corny (sorry Martin).<br /><br />After the first two dark and heavily bass-driven tracks, it is not until track 9, \\"Soft Touch/Raw Nerve\\" that the record really wakes up again from a lull through most of the first half of the album.  As far as track arrangement it seems to bounce back and forth a little bit here, but still provides a nice `nighttime driving' feel until \\"Soothe My Soul\\" and \\"Goodbye\\" which are fittingly appropriate ending tracks.  The latter being a classic `anthem-ending' track, where thousands of people could easily chant \\"Goood... good... byyye\\" you might expect this to be their last song of a live performance... before the marathon encore, of course.<br /><br />Conceptually it works fairly well, there seems to be a solid through-line which the listeners can enjoy something of a consistent flow, save maybe the one stand out experimental blip-driven track, \\"My Little Universe\\" which probably should have been saved as a B-side and left off the record.<br /><br />It's not the Depeche Mode of the 80's, but these boys can still make music.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game keeps me occupied for hours. I love playing it..It is addictive. would recommend it to all my friends
B00B69UQEO|2.0|I just received this CD today and immediately put it in.  My first thought was \\"who replaced Depeche Mode with this band?\\"  Even my wife didn't think it sounded like them.  By the second song it finally started sounding like Depeche Mode, but not very good Depeche Mode.<br /><br />Overall I found the whole thing rather dull and lifeless.  No songs stood out or got caught in my head and by the end of it I felt relieved that I'd listened to the whole thing and it was finally finished.
B000FA675C|3.0|*No Spoilers<br /><br />I read the book years ago when it was a new release.  Yeah, I bought into the hype of Dan Brown.  Peer Pressure.<br /><br />I will give Brown credit that the Da Vinci Code was a entertaining story, in which, I admit to reading from cover to cover in several sessions.<br /><br />My biggest gripe was the quality of writing and use of too many deus ex machinas.  Just my opinion.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book thinking it was a light read and really not expecting too much since the last YA books I've read were so mediocre.  This book absolutely blew me away!  It was NOT a light read, but it was so good that it was a fast read.  This is NOT your typical YA book (at least the vast majority of the YAs recommended for me)- it deals with very deep, dark, and mature material.  Also, I loved how the author ties every little detail together at the end - things you did not even think was a big deal all played a higher function so at the end you get that - &#34;Oh it now makes sense!&#34;<br />A must read!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Didn't like this one. Makes you afraid to fly because you know this happens. Friends don't let pilots snort and fly
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|i didnt have any problem downloading this on my iPad. ive tried downloading this 6 times on my Kindle. still wont finish the innitial download when I open the game. Please fix for Kindle users.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Just don't like remakes. If you want to prequel or sequel a movie, I am fine with that, but don't remake a movie.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Wasn't really looking for a plot.  From what I have heard, its not about the plot.  Great for the action, though.  And great concept too.  Orc cannonballs...EPIC!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|My wife couldn't watch and understand this, (too much to do in her head). It's like that crazy song willy wonka sings
B00933JF74|5.0|How refreshing to have a game that isn't incessantly asking you to connect to Facebook and/or add your friends, doesn't require in-app purchases in order to advance or gain special items.  You pay for the game and play the game.  Although I purchased it after, it even got an update so it looks like the developers are still supporting it.<br /><br />There are various campaigns and a lot of Sandbox versions.  In addition, you can have multiple saves of different games.  I am playing another mobile game that requires in-app purchases or seriously long delays in order to advance unless I want purchase the items that I'm waiting to build. By contrast, Townsmen is a refreshing, relaxing change of pace.<br /><br />I am playing on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 wifi(Amazon Appstore purchase) and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 wifi(Google Play purchase).  As of 3/26/13, the Amazon version is a tad behind the version 1.2.3 on the Google Play store.  Neither has had any crashes, stalls or other issues.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really watched the hostage situation unfold on the news during that time. Had no idea this was going on at all.
B002KV4NTQ|4.0|Yes it has the wonderfully nasty &#34;Brown Sugar,&#34; but I've come to believe that &#34;Bitch,&#34; which used to open side two if I'm not mistaken, is an even better song.  You don't hear that sort of swaggering male sexuality much these days.  We live in an era of sensitivity!  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of a clunkers -- &#34;Sway&#34; -- and the meandering &#34;Moonlit Mile.&#34;
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Started out a bit slow, but then turned left and went crazy. Very surprising ending. I like it very much
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Wasn't too impress with the movie.  That is all I am going to say.  I really hate having to write 20 more words for a movie I was not im pressed with
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I had not heard of this movie and was just trying out the Prime Amazon vids. This was a fantastic movie. Tommy Lee Jones just knows how to put the bad in Cop
0307010856|5.0|I have always loved this book. I read it to my children, and that is why I bought it for my grandchild.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|a none stoping on going adventure with a lot of heart ,fath and trusth for follow comeracs to reley on
0679805273|5.0|Great Book my children loved it and was in great condition.Thank you so much!!  This book has always been a favorite of mine!
B004P8JPS6|2.0|Although Lee Child tries to justify his actions, Jack Reacher murders 3 people in cold blood in this novel while condemning others for committing similar murders that they thought were justified.  In other novels Reacher has killed people, but almost always in self defense.  Here, Reacher acts as Judge, Jury, and Executioner while purportedly performing his duties as a Military Policeman.  Reacher should not be above the law.  This will be the last Reacher novel I will read because it puts Reacher above the law when he is suppposed to be enforcing the law.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved it!! Wanting more more now that I have finished. I need to see the movie and merge my images with the theatrical version.
B0088W4YTK|4.0|I enjoyed Season 3 because each episode explored another dimension of the characters' love and loyalty towards each other in the face of increasingly challenging adversity. I was frequently kept on my toes guessing how Shepherd and McKay were going to get out of their next bind. The tensions and denouements of each episode make them a satisfying 45 minutes while continuing the saga so that you look forward to watching the next episode without feeling compelled to do a long marathon.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is another great game from G5!!!  This is one of my favorites..Great graphics and very interesting story..Kind of spooky.But I definitely recommend it!!
B000PKX2KA|3.0|I had ordered this unit thinking I was going to use it with my iPad however it is really meant for a laptop and I haven't had a chance to set that up and use. Shame on me for not paying closer attention to the specs on the item.
1608871452|5.0|This is an awesome book. Love it with all the details of how the TV Show is made and all the different kinds of monsters The Boys have been up against. I also like the way the Show with the Directors and Cast and Crew bring all this information to their FAN's. They make all the fans feel like they are part of the show and it's like the fans are included from the writers filming and all the conventions they attend during the year. Great Book and Great Show. Thank you Eric Kripke, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalacke, Misha Collins, Jeremy Carver, Jim Michaels, and Ben Edlund. you are doing a great Job.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Lil Wayne has been making music for almost 2 decades now. But by listening to the quality of music displayed on this albim, you would think twice that this guy is a veteran hip hop artist. I haven't heard music this juvenile, or this useless in a while. Lil Wayne's best album will always remain to be Tha Carter III. This Lil Wayne isn't any different from the Lil Wayne you here from all the singles he is featured on with his usual collaborators from YMCMB. The only thing I find somewhat interesting about this album is the cover art which was done by Kanye West. This album is filled with half-thought out punchlines, mediocre production and an unenthusiastic Wayne.
1476733953|5.0|Oh Hugh, you couldn't anger me any more. I'm entrapped in your gorgeous world and, meanwhile, MY world has totally fallen apart. The dishes haven't been done in days, I'm out of groceries, my inbox is full of angry emails, I'm out of clean clothes, my family thinks I'm dead, and the dog has taken to eating the furniture for sustenance-- all because I can't put Wool down.<br />It's been a long, long time since I've read a book this good. But don't read it if you enjoy being productive (or eating).
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This was such a GREAT purchase!  What a wonderful birthday gift for my husband!<br /><br />Can't wait for the Part 2, 3, etc!<br /><br />Thanks very much!
B0018RFLN0|5.0|If you can get over seeing a very young Tom Cruise, this original MI still offers plenty of thrills. It started the franchise and is fun to revisit.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Our toddler loves this movie with all of the bright colors and adventure. Cute story and doesn't burn us out when we see it every few days.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|One of the best movie adaptations I have seen in a long time.  Having read all the books,  I can get more from the actions only alluded to in this richly visual presentation.
B00AOOIIVA|4.0|This movie is cute but a little dark for our toddler, maybe more of the 6 or older range so they can understand it. It is all black and white which is cool for us adults but the toddler could care less...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was really an amazing book. It completely changed my life. I don't feel afraid of being myself anymore. I highly recommend it.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|Love this movie- funny and the toddler loves it too so we all win! Dreamworks hit a home run with this film.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Much faster paced then the first book and in my opinion a better read. I can't wait to download and read book 3!
B004EBT5CU|1.0|I thought I would give this a try for my first Adele CD but was not a fan. I only knew one song and I can hear that on the radio.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love how this game has so many different games but I am not a big fan of how much money you have to earn to even buy games so it's going to take forever to even play all the games.
B004GYY714|4.0|I think tune in radio is okay the thing that I like about it is that it's free and you don't have to sign in for anything. It's just that u have to have  Wi-Fi.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|This CPU is awesome!!! I love it.  If you are coming from like a 2007 pentium 4 like me you will be astonished.  It absolutely destroys pretty much AMD CPU (not graphics) for the price.  The HD 4000 graphics seal the deal.  Can play games like Minecraft flawlessly at max settings.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|the book was awesome i couldn't put it down...................its a mush read..... ............... ..... . . . . . .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a very realistic book.  The way the story changes leaves you surprised and the way it all comes together at the end is wonderful.  I also like how the writer doesn't bog down in the smut of sex scenes.  She skims the surface of that and then the rest is up to your imagination.  I've read a few other books by this author and enjoyed them as well.
0345404475|5.0|:D Love it. Perfect for School and a great read as well. Enough space to write all over the book and paper cover is comfortable to hold.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|Totally a fantastic album from the first track to the last. Great range. Not single disappointment, and the combination of John Legend's smooth vocals with The Roots' deep, ranging sounds is perfection.
B00004YRQA|5.0|this is what i order and this is what i got a MB card 8GB SONY brand like the description said i like it thank you
B000SEI230|2.0|Blah. In this dry book is hidden a beautiful story. It's too bad you have to read the whole thing  to get to the \\"good\\" aka not quite so boring part.
B00999DFP0|3.0|A few of my discs were scratched upon arrival and wouldn't play at all. Not cool. I'm returning them ASAP.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This is a FUN movie to watch! The singers are hi-octane excellent. The characters are funny and enjoyable to watch.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Cute book, easy read.  Great beach book. Characters are believable, I enjoyed the growth each character in the book went through.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I just got through watching this movie again.  Have watched it several times before but wanted the 50th anniversary edition.  Nicely boxed.  I try to read this book every year and have read it many times since I first read it in 1960.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I loved this book. It is so fascinating; there are ideas about success that I had never considered. There are certain situations that need to be in place before success can happen. The most interesting aspect is the fact that success is not ONLY dependent on the person's ability and intellect. There are many other factors.Read the book and be intrigued!
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|Just that it seems better than it is, but i am happy. If you love watches this cuold be part of your collection.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|good graphics<br />easy to move around. interesting story line spooky effects.  nusic made it even spooky. no freezes or hard to see item clues easy to follow
B004LWZW2E|4.0|Gore, violence and disturbing content no longer bother me much as a long-time horror fan.  However, there is one sub-genre, when executed correctly, that can give me the shivers:  ghost stories.  While insidious involves more than ghosts, I feel it definitely falls into this category.  I've spoken to many people who didn't think this movie was scary at all.  Maybe it depends on your state of mind when you see it.  I saw it in the theater and I was completely creeped out.  The atmosphere, sound, and imagery (produced with a minimal budget) in the film cut me to the core.  It's some spooky stuff!  Many also saw the film as a rehash of Poltergeist.  I can see the parallels, but I didn't notice them when I first saw the film and, anyway, I still think Insidious stands on its own.  If you're someone who is easily creeped out (a fraidy cat like me), I definitely recommend it.  You might want to have Toy Story set to go after it's over, though, to alleviate the spookiness!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Differs from the books, no doubt, but the TV version is wonderful. Casting is spot on and the changes made to the books plot are usually just fine. I love this series and can't wait for the next season.
B00000JPH6|4.0|Seen it years ago and still enjoy it today Jim Henson was a great man with a lot of great<br />ideas for family fun and entertainment.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I was delightfully impressed by Looper. The story was far better than I expected and the acting was good. This is the kind of sci-fi story telling that gets the nerd juices flowing.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|needed to complete the set and was a great addition to my video library<br />Could not miss it.Great ending to the story
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Entertaining and loads of great action, but the story takes a long time to evolve. Plus I was disappointed with the return of a 1950's style villain who is absurdly feminized. This sort of contrasting good masculine with bad masculine is ridiculous and contributes to negative attitudes and violence against LGBT people.
B001U891HE|5.0|I am a great lover of Shakespeare and am happy to have this available for reference when I think of phrases that are cool.
B009O07NMA|5.0|The songs are very catchy and I liked every song on the cd.  The singles are what got me to purchase the cd and I sure am glad I did!  These two guys are a very dynamic duo.  I have no doubt that FGL will be in the ranks of Brooks and Dunn one day!  I can't wait to see what these two are capable of.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I thought this one might be better than the first one, but I found it tedious with all of the texting.
B008P9M614|5.0|Finally, all seasons in one and what a great deal!  I couldn't ask for anything more!  The show is great we love the show we have been waiting to see the first 4 seasons but they don't show it on prime time.  Thank you Amazon!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I am just getting into the Jack Reacher , with this being my second book read.  I like the seemingly-impossible situations and the way that Jack uses his background skills and his abililty to adapt.  These are compelling books for me.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|An intriguing premise, well executed.  I was excited to hear that King was writing this book, and in most ways, I feel he succeeded.  You can tell he did an enormous amount of research in preparing to write this.  When the main character raced to confront Oswald, the scenes were riveting.  One of King's best books.
B003B02O7I|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  This was a story of excess at many levels, of steadfastness and redemption.  I have reread it several times and still love it.
B00BF11STU|5.0|lots of action, a little rough at times when they are wash boarding prisoners but great movie. I would watch again,
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I do not know what I was thinking, but the premise seems stupid to me and I did not like it.
B00BR4QNJ0|1.0|the land was peaceful. then when zombies came the people. where. dead and the dead came alife and then one person comes and kills the dead.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|I have been around enough SEALs to know that this could not have been an easy book to write.  I hope it helps the families of the fallen.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This is a really fun and addicting game, but it doesn't save manually, has no exit option,and won't let me gather bounties. But overall, I love WAA!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a good start for me and I have read more Jack Reacher novels.  I wish I could be that cool.
B002GIBVWA|5.0|This has more than one song that I had heard before but couldn't figure out who the artist was.  This is a very relaxing cd that you will love too.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is an interesting premise to me and I found this light reading moved along quickly and kept my interest..
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Great show.  As soon as I watched the first show I was hooked.  After watching season 5 I wanted to watch the pilot show.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked it, but it seemed a little slower to me.  I guess I was expecting something a little different.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is flat out great its plays like an old school space invaders style game but withe just enough mechanics from modern bullet hell<br />shooters to mix things up in a very interesting way.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Really awesome book. It was very hard taking breaks between reading!<br />So worth spending the time to read the book, plus its got valuable messages.
B001VNB54A|4.0|My dad was at Guadaul Canal, so it hit home for me.  Dad didn't say much about the war, but he did mentioned the gold mining, and the &#34;no prisoner&#34; rule.  It must have been brutal.  I guess that's why he didn't talk much or have many friends. Excellent video.
B0081336FO|4.0|Sherlock is a must for mystery fans.<br />I live the modern twist on this classic series.<br />It always keeps you guessing.
B001QKSWOE|3.0|I did read this to the end.  I found it a fast read, but did not enjoy the silliness of it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think Walking Dead is the best horror/zombie entertainment ever. I've  seen my fare share of brain eater movies over the years, but by far this show is the best in this catagory. And it's better than just being a 90 minute movie because the story gets better and better every week leaving us on the edge of our seats by the end of the episode, impatiently waiting on next week. Love this show and amaizingly enough so does my wife who does not like horror type movies/TV shows but she loves this because it's not just gore after gore, it's a thrilling story about everyday people, and it makes you wonder what it may be like to find yourself in a horrible epidemic scenerio like this.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This series is incredible; once you start reading it is very hard to stop.<br />The vastness and stagnation of this world under the iron fist of a living god-like emperor reminds me of Orwell's 1984, albeit in a fantasy setting where Allomancy (one type magic in this universe) replaces the technology in Orwell's novel.<br />A must read for fantasy fans.
B002EBDP9G|5.0|This book is a great gift for someone interested in seeking a deeper understanding of the history of the US.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed this entire series! I love the Amazon Instant Video app for my iPad. Made viewing so easy!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|It's a great album, listened to it with a friend on a roadtrip so I decided to buy it.  Why is there no autorip for this title?  Amazon has it for their last album.  Not buying it here if they don't have autorip.  If I have to rip it myself I might as well head over to target.com for the album with 5 extra tracks.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I love that while recognizable as the killers they always have a new sound, from song to song not just from album to album.  This album is no different!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Spectacular visuals, wonderful story line, beautiful animation, a show for all ages. A classic that could be watched several times a year!
B000SEI230|5.0|Anyone looking for a little faith or a simple reminder that God's plan may not be what we imagine, but is the one that is meant for us.<br />Anyone looking for a reminder that young love is the purest form.<br />Anyone looking for a book that can change your out look on life.<br />This is a book you must not pass up!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|I've read a lot of presidential biographies but none that discuss the relationships between them so candidly.  Wonderful book.  I look forward to more from these authors.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I thought this case was going to offer more protection and have easier hands free operation. It is a nice case overall and the user has adapted to it, but not as good as the leather one I purchased for my device.
B0087IT8FK|4.0|Les Intouchables relates the largely true story of how Philippe, a rich Parisian man who is paraplegic after a paragliding accident, hires Driss, an unemployed young man from a troubled suburb to be his assistant. In the film Driss is from Senegal; in real life he was Algerian. Driss, who only applied for the job so he can be eligible for benefit payment, is at first both bored and horrified by what he expected to do: feed, clean and drive around a man with no feeling below his neck. Driss shows no sympathy or pity for Philippe's handicap and pushes him to become more adventurous. For example, he ditches the boring van and starts driving around Paris in Philippe's Maserati, and presses his boss to set up a meeting with a woman penpal he's never seen. As the film progresses the two men develop a deepening friendhship. All the time though Driss is aware that his family - he is the eldest of several children of a single mother - is vulnerable and it becomes clear a younger brother is falling into the hands of a drugs ring. I don't want to give away the ending but the film doesn't pull its punches. This delightful and warm movie broke all sorts of box office records in France and is highly recommended.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I am very happy with the quality of the product and the price. No missing disks or any duplicates. I did contact the seller and got a quick and honest reply. I am very happy with my purchase. I would recommend this product to those looking for a nice simple collection of the Friends series.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I was a bit skeptical but it ended up being a great read! Kept my attention throughout. Love the letter format of the book.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I remember this time well but it never seemed quite as exciting as this- probably because I was a young teen. The cast is great, no one steals the show, and it's a non stop ride. Well worth it. Good job, Ben Affleck!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|It is a guilty pleasure to the eye and to the soul. Whatever you believe about life this deserves your joining Pi. My wife and I were glued to the movie from start to end. The real benefit comes upon reflection of the movie down the road.
1118109791|4.0|Currently using the book as a guide for the preparation, the book has in-depth coverage of the subject in hand.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Very entertaining and absorbing movie...well acted & although the movie was long, it didn't seem like it.  The actors were well selected and did a great job.
0811879542|5.0|i have 2 very active boys and this book is just the ticket! it is  very fun and keeps them involved
B004AQR29C|3.0|This movie was OK for filling in the time...action packed and the action stars &#34;did their thing&#34; as usual.  Would recommend only if nothing else was available.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very enjoyable program.  The variety of characters and situations make this program non stop entertainment. We enjoyed all three seasons and looking forward to season four.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really don't understand why people are saying you &quot;have to pay&quot; to continue playing the game. As long as you don't spend all your diamonds on stupid creep like all the energy you can buy the first time you run out, then you will be just fine. Especially since you earn more as you go. I haven't spent a dime on this game and I find it very fun!
1451648537|5.0|If you own any Apple products this book will give you an insight into why they work the way they do,  and I have a much better understanding of the simple genius of Steve Jobs and the products of \\"his\\" Apple.  It was a fascinating read about one of the great innovators of my lifetime.  I'm not much of a biography reader, and this one captivated me from cover to cover.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Nice and simple, not frickin huge like a lot of watches are today.  Just a good basic automatic. I wish the numbers were reversed, hours on the outside of the dial, minutes on the inside.  But this is a good value for $50.00
0062082353|5.0|Great read. Arrived on time, was adequately packaged, and was consumed on receipt. Thanks for stocking this useful item. I pray this purchase helps his family.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|There are times when a hearty laugh is necessary; an airplane and this story allow you to enjoy without those wield looks when the guffaw is too loud.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|One of the early knock-your-eyes-out science fiction movies.  I ordered this because I had remembered how cool the portrayal of the future was.  Now, decades later, that view of future technology is almost &#34;Steam Punk&#34;.  It's still highly entertaining, but not for the same reasons.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|I loved this movie and the ones that followed. Just as good as the rest of them. Thrills, chills, excitement, action and suspense. Got to watch it. I know I will watch it again for sure.
160459201X|5.0|Book arrived on time!  I am still trying to believe that my mind can work as well as the book implies.
B002DJSBPW|4.0|This movie was crazy but it was a good movie. What I mean crazy so much happened that wasn't expected. It made you want to rewind a look again to see if that was what you was seeing. We purchased it to watch it again. Fear I wouldn't want to go through what happened in this movie for real.
B002R2B6NE|5.0|I've seen this movie many times and it never loses it's lustre. Great actors and suspenseful plot guaranteed to thrill!
B00130UFY2|5.0|I loved this movie and the ones that followed. Just as good as the rest of them. Thrills, chills, excitement, action and suspense. Got to watch it. I know I will watch it again for sure.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Google's in the process of screwing the pooch by eliminating both iGoogle.com, and their RSS Reader applications.<br /><br />Feedly steps into the breach and makes it one click simple to migrate all your RSS feeds directly from Google into their exceptional news reader app.  It was slick!  I had my entire set of RSS feeds up and running in no time.<br /><br />Buh-Bye Google!
B0042KA5EK|5.0|Great show! Never know what your going to get. Excitement every time. Action so much of it. I like to watch her and Alex get down and fight them bad guys. I am caught up with it on TV but it was worth buying every episode until I got there. WATCH!!! Must see!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is an amazing game and I just don't know what to say other than its awesome!!!Also if you like this game then you would deffinatly like ww2!!!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|I loved this movie and the ones that followed. Thrills, chills, excitement, action and suspense. Got to watch it. I know I will watch it again for sure.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The old was much easier to navigate. When in the portrait screen, only half the temperature is shown in the square in the upper right of the app on my Kindle Fire. My vote is for the old AccuWeather.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Once again I found a outstanding show. Once again I bought the episodes until I caught up with it on TV. The show you never know what is going to happen next. I love watching them arrows and what he does with them. He came along way from being lost but he is doing what needs to be done. I hope they don't cancel this show like they always do with the good stuff. You got to watch it too see what I am talking about. I believe it was worth every dime to catch up with it on TV.
0345803485|5.0|I really like this book because it's not your typical reading. And it's been a while since I read a good book, given the fact that most books now revolve around the ''Twilight'' concept which can get pretty boring after a couple years. No, this book is about something not spoken of publicly, a dark world that I had no idea existed. It's a fresh new idea for a book that doesn't involve vampires or warewolves. But I wouldn't recommend this novel to everyone, only to people that I closely know, otherwise I'll look like a pervert. If you want to read something different and expand your boundaries, this is the book for you.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE FUN TO WATCH BUT I DONT KNOW IF I WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN. MY DAUGHTER WANTED TO WATCH IT BECAUSE SHE LOVES JENNIFER LAWRENCE AND SHE PREFORMED WELL IN THE MOVIE. MAYBE I WILL WATCH IT AGAIN I JUST HAVE TO BE IN THE MOOD FOR IT. TRY IT YOU MAY REALLY LIKE IT.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had high expectations for this season. When first season ended with everyone receiving the news of war,  it felt up in the air.  When this season started it led with that but there is so much more packed into Downton as should be expected. Deceit, lies,  love, angst. It is very gripping and keeps you excited about what will happen next.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I thought this movie would have been a little better since Denzel was in it. But all your favorites disappoint you at times. At least he wasn't playing a crazy police guy didn't like that movie. Anyway, it is a good movie to watch and makes you think and the ending is what it should be.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. it is easy to use and has many different options and things to do. I love the Easter countdown one that i am doing with my daughter.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I spent $4.99 to rent and watch this movie - but it was not worth it. Some of the visuals are stunning, but the movie itself is dragging and much less interesting than what I expected!
B00846WWVM|4.0|Well this game is fun challenging and sometimes it just makes me mad. Sometimes when I'm working on a level I get so mad at my device that I want to throw it across the room. That is why I gave it a three star rating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game rocks it's the worth the money &lt;3 I really really really think you should get it

B004H1V5RU|1.0|They tried too hard to make it super hard and they did.  Many times the plastic cannot keep pace with the demands of the design, so the ball wedges and traps itself due to lack of quality and tolearances.  It is just impossible to finish the track, yes it is exasperating like the box says.

0307473473|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect going into this story...really popular, pretty good reviews...could I really think it was going to be good? I also started it once and ended up putting it down at the end of the opening. I'm so very glad that I had to pick it up again and really read it. When the movie arrived, I ran out of time, as I really like to read a book before I see a movie. So, I restarted.<br /><br />It did start slowly. I wasn't sure where the story was going, and the names made me very aware of the foreign aspects of the story. That all fell away. At some point, without realizing what was happening, I was sucked into the story. The foreign aspects of the story became enticing, and the mystery unfolded engrossingly. I really enjoyed the story, and really look forward to reading the next story in the trilogy!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|well it would have been a five star but the app is really slow so I cant control where my person goes then they crash! u need to fix that then it will be a perfect app! wait there's one more thing..... you need to change how much the people are
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Narrated by Death, who is at times a plot-spoiler, The Book Thief is the story of an eleven year old girl in Nazi Germany. As I'm sure you can predict, it's about death, hate and the human condition, and the human spirit. WW2 makes a good backdrop to explore these themes for a younger audience.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Much like the Crosby & Nash box sets this 4-cd collection shows a similar dip in quality levels from about 1975 or mid way through disc 3 here. But this box set highlights Stills stunning career from 1966-73 with tracks from The Buffalo Springfield, CSN, CSNY and the superb Manassas double from 1972. Whilst Crosby's had an extra cd of extras & unreleased tracks here we have about 20 of these most of which disappoint especially the much talked about Stills Hendrix collaboration of which we have barely 3 minutes. The real howler for me is that once again a box set has failed to supply the fans with the 9-minute 'Bluebird' missed off the Springfield box set not here. Maybe Graham Nash who compiled this box set thought we need to have some stuff from the 80s & 90s - no we don't. 5 stars for his songs with Buffalo Springfield, his stunning first 2 solo albums, CSN debut & the timeless Manassas record. A lavish booklet is also here, but it's strange that known as Captain Manyhands during the 60s Still has had little involvement in this box set. An essential purchase BUT if you haven't any of the above can I suggest you purchase these other records first.<br /><br />Disc 1 from his Springfield early songs to Carry On in 20 odd tracks - about 2-3 years shows an incredible development of his song writing skills - how many artists can show in such maturity in such a short space of time? Incredible. These days 'artists' take that long to make one record.<br /><br />By Disc 4 the acoustic brilliance has been swamped by the predominance of synthesisers and drum machines, songs like Treetop Flyer are an oasis in amongst the over produced songs, which themselves are some of the waekest Stills wrote. Songs from CSN's 'Live It Up' & 'Allies' should have been left out and heaven knows what Nash & Bernstein were thinking of with 'No Tears Left' from CSNY's shocker 'Looking Forward'. It's only when Stills is left alone on 'Welfare Blues' do we hear the real Stills. Stills Alone - indeed the best way.<br /><br />I blame Graham Nash for much of the poor choices on Disc 4 -where was the quality control?<br /><br />There are some odd selections 'Dear Mr Fantasy' not written by Stills and was on the CSN 1990 box set - all very odd. I think Nash believes their 80s & 90s output is valid which must account for some of the weaker selections here. What we could do with is a Manassas expanded edition.<br /><br />Songwriter, guitarist, producer, arranger, multi-instrumentalist Stills seems to have passed most people by which is a great pity as he has contributed some truly great musical moments. Not the the easiest person to understand and with his own demons, Stills songs such as 'Do For The Others' about the death of Crosby's girlfriend in a motorbike accident demonstrate that lyrically and musically he kept CN & Y in the shade during his halcyon period. For me Stephen Stills represents the peak of West Coast music from 66-73, he's not had the best of health recently but still tours with CSN and his guitar playing shows what a talent he is/was. The CSN debut, Stephen Stills 1 (in the snow) & Manassas show Stills at his peak and are essential to any record (can I call it that?) collection.
B005I6EU48|2.0|I really wanted to like this.  I liked that it looked like a book, and I liked the different ways I could prop it up.  But it will not consistently keep my kindle in place.  Yes, I can see the rubber backing to the elastic to *help* keep the little straps in place.  Good in theory.  I have also placed a non skid rubber piece beneath the kindle. Nope. Still slips.  I've used this since December and I'm online today looking for a replacement.  I truly loved my cover for my old kindle and I wish the new one could use it. The final straw was it again slipping out last night and almost hitting the floor.  Alas, the trust is gone.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|The Jack Ryan Series has been ongoing for almost three decades and are one of the best fictional series written to date, political warefare at its finest!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Well played AMD, well played indeed. This APU was 10x easier to install than my i7 rig.<br /><br />i7-3820 3.6Ghz (3.8 Turbo) -$299.00<br />VS.<br />A-10 5800k 3.8Ghz (4.2 Turbo) -$130.00<br /><br />While I personally prefer Intel and feel that I am worth the extra money, I will definitely be recommending AMD products to my friends... especially the ones who I will be building for :)
B009M5CJI0|5.0|It was hard to put the book down at times,yet hard to pick it up at other times.  I enjoyed it all the times!
B000FQITXE|5.0|A wonderful collection of some well known and some much less known music, mainly a superb Italian music and also beautiful pieces by Biber, Locke, etc., and a magnificent performance of the complete Brandenburg Concertos.<br />The star instrument in many pieces in this collection is the recorder, and no wonder, since the director of Il Giardino Armonico, the great Giovanni Antonini, is a recorder player - and what a recorder player he is! He makes his hollow stick to sing so sweetly, to sing in Italian, and in this respect, the works here for the recorder are a definitive performances. After all, music is not just universal, but also local, and when you compare other non Italian recorder players to Antonini, you certainly can admire them for some things, but they all lack that strange and enchanting Italian mix of mellifluous and fieri facet with that unpredictable sinister facet which exist all the time bellow the surface.<br /><br />Nevertheles, as i wrote, the Brandenburg Concertos receives here a magnificent performance...<br /><br />A treasure of great music by the great Il Giardino Armonico in a ridiculous price!<br /><br />The recordings are usually good, but not extraordinary.<br /><br />As usuall in the last few years, there are no linear notes in those bargain boxes - and this is a shame and a mistake! If the record companies wants to fight illegal downloads and all sorts of copying, they should tempt the potential buyers with a lavish and very informative booklet. It's not so difficult, they know it.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|JT has done it again. I Love this Cd. Can't wait for part 2. i recommend that you get it... i promise you will not be disappointed.

B00BF11STU|4.0|Great Movie!  I really liked the way the film highlights all the heroes (both the intel and military personnel) of the this operation and mostly ignores the the political side

B008KE3960|3.0|&#34;Free&#34; but any upgrade requires money. Big Bombs are $10 for an infinite supply, Maps cost money, extra plans cost money. Should be able to earn those in game. Minor glitch every now and then where the path a plane takes will jump across the screen. Could be a phone glitch or a dirty screen though.
B000VNMMR0|3.0|First off, this is a &#34;kick-ass&#34; action movie!!  Love it!!  I have an old copy of the Dolby Surround Sound DVD of this movie.  Then I recently learned about DTS vs Dolby!  I purchased this DVD movie a week ago &#34;specifically&#34; because the advertisement included &#34;DTS Surround Sound&#34; (DTS Discrete ES 6.1)!!  DTS is completely awesome and makes Dolby seem tame!!  I received my DVD in the mail today from a non-amazon seller!  I was VERY disappointed to find out that the DTS Surround Sound is NOT a feature of this DVD and the DTS symbol is not on the back of the DVD case!  I had discovered DTS after purchasing &#34;The Lord of The Rings&#34; &#34;Extended&#34; versions!!  Those LOTR's DVD's completely rock and shake my living room and I heard many sounds that I had never heard when using the Dolby Surround Sound, which is featured on the original &#34;Lord of The Rings&#34; DVD's and on the EXTENDED versions too, but is tame compared to the DTS feature!!!  I also learned that almost every movie sold these days has DTS MASTER ES 7.1 channel Surround Sound only on the Blueray version!!  The cheap DVD's put out for sale for new movies, such as &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; and &#34;The Hobbit&#34; only come with Dolby Surround Sound!!  If you want to have the DTS MASTER Discrete 7.1 feature, you will have to purchase the more expensive Blueray disk!!  Some older movies can be found with DTS, pre-2010 usually, but for today's movies like &#34;ARGO&#34;, you can buy the DVD with Dolby or the Blueray version with Dolby and DTS!!  Always use DTS!!!  WOW!!!  What a difference DTS makes!!! I have contacted Amazon and have just received a full refund of this falsely advertised DVD version!!  If &#34;DTS&#34; and its symbol is not listed on the back of the package, then it DOES NOT HAVE DTS!!  Don't buy it!!  If you have not heard of DTS yet, then do some research on-line!!  If you happen to have access to the LOTRings, Extended versions, put in disk 1 of The Fellowship of the Ring, go to 1 hour, 39 minutes into the movie, using DTS in &#34;set-up&#34;, and prepare to be &#34;ROCKED&#34; during that scene!!!  Lastly, the original &#34;Pirates of the Carribean&#34; movie with Johnny Depp has DTS on it!!!  Give it a new look!!!!  Enjoy!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it is the best I love my horse its name is beauty is a lot of fun
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Woohoo! All right! I'm overjoyed that Depeche Mode finally came back after a hiatus of 20 years. They've been sorely missed in the world of music, even though, I have to admit, the quality of music in the last two decades (with glorious artists like Justin Bieber and Ke$ha) has increased drastically enough to almost make me forget about Depeche (pronounced De-pay-chee) Mode. Almost!<br /><br />I think that Dave Gayhan is one of the sexayest lead singers ever. Caliente! Rowr! I'm glad that he's checked out of rehab yet again just to be able to tour with the band across bingo halls and church basements in the U.S. Awesome!<br /><br />Let's look at some of the sweet songs on this CD. Okay!<br /><br />This CD is easily the best De-pay-chee Mode offering since its last one (whose name I can't remember). Take The Child Inside, for instance. This song just spoke to me because it's about Gayhan's love of children. Not a Michael Jackson-type of \\"love\\" of children, but a more general love of children. Mmmm, mmmm, good. Or how about Heaven? This is a cover of Bryan Adam's 1988 power ballad song, only Gayhan sings it more sexayly so that it made me melt all over inside! Ooooo, yeah. And Broken is a retelling of the Amy Lee/Seether song from the Punisher movie soundtrack!!! Hot diggity!<br /><br />Folks, you're missing a slice of heaven on earth if you don't buy Delta Machine. I urge you to buy it from Amazon right now, even if you have very little money left because the U.S. economy is not growing anymore thanks to Obama. Peace out, dawg.
