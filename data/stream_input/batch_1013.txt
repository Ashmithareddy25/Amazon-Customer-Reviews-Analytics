B001HN694K|5.0|I always find something to love about Tim Burton's insane epics. In spite of the annoyingly convoluted ending of his adaptation of Willy Wonka, There were numerous reasons to enjoy that film. So, I was definitely ready for a Wonderland re-do, as I always loved the story but felt that there should be a different adaptation, bringing a freshness to the Alice story. Well, Burton certainly delivered there, though there are a couple snags he could have worked out a bit more.     Burton's favorite stablemate Depp is flawlessly fantastic as the Mad Hatter. Just when you start to believe he has too much to do in the movie, he suddenly surprises you with his many talents again, making viewers happy that he always seems to be there as big as life in order to keep everyone enjoying the journey.     Alice's character goes from whimsically perplexed to nonchalant to heroically motivated with a calmness that is rarely seen quite as necessarily suitable in a Burton film.     The Red Queen is positively preposterous at every turn, demanding everyone's head's be lopped off in nearly every scene she appears and her sister the white queen is sickeningly sweet in the most macabre, understated, unsettling and twisted way.     The Cheshire cat's toothy grin looks like something out of Burton's stop action animation films and is entirely creepy. I felt cheated each time he made an appearance and disappeared. I wanted to see more of him, no pun intended.     The sets are lavish in their computer driven design. The paintbox is supremely stupendous in it's strange concoction of bright colors and almost nightmarish feel. Effects like the Red Queen's enormous head and small body are so perfectly executed, you would swear that Helena looked like this in real life.     So, if the movie a 100% success? No, there are little things that will leave you wondering, yet you won't care because the film's shortcomings are so overshadowed by Burton's ability to bring so many elements together in his unique story weaving.     Ultimately, this version of Alice will have you believing in six impossible things before breakfast too, and isn't that what Wonderland is supposed to be all about?
B003LYJUXU|4.0|I greatly disliked the first Oasis compilation Stop The Clocks for many reasons, not least of which was its over-emphasis on the early years while discarding many fine tracks from the band's later albums, including all of Be Here Now.<br /><br />Time Flies corrects many of the errors of Stop The Clocks, but is it quite definitive?  Not exactly, but it's close.<br /><br />For starters, this improves greatly over Stop The Clocks by including tracks from Be Here Now, and while this doesn't have fine album cuts like \\"Don't Go Away\\" or \\"It's Gettin' Better Man,\\" the inclusion of Be Here Now material is definitely welcome.  Secondly, the inclusion of post-Morning Glory staples such as \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out,\\" \\"Lord Don't Slow Me Down,\\" \\"Who Feels Love,\\" and \\"The Shock of the Lightning\\" helps to round out the history of the band, and their presence is also greatly welcome.<br /><br />That's the good.  Unfortunately, Time Flies leans a bit too much on Heathen Chemistry, and that comes at the expense of some truly great tracks.  Songs not here include \\"Rock N' Roll Star,\\" \\"Slide Away,\\" \\"Rockin' Chair,\\" \\"Stay Young,\\" \\"Fade Away,\\" and all of those would be tremendous additions to these discs.  Furthermore, the exclusion of \\"Acquiesce,\\" one of the band's greatest songs, is an inexcusable omission.<br /><br />However, this is a much better collection than Stop The Clocks, and a decent introduction to one of Britpop's finest bands...though it won't replace Definitely Maybe and Morning Glory.
1586638491|5.0|This is a very useful format for anyone reading Shakespeare, even those who are familiar with the text of a particular play.  The book does not interpret, but merely presents the dialogue and stage instructions in modern English.  An excellent tool for students and teachers alike.
6305127646|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Val Kilmer movies.  Just the right mix of action and romance.
B001FB5634|3.0|The book was better as usual, although it wasn't too dissappointing. The actors did a marvelous job with a very depressing story that has absolutely no hope. I did like it better when I was reading it and had the visualizations in my mind of what actually was going on.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Plausible plot, quirky humor, intense action. An excellent series, promises great things in future seasons.
031606792X|1.0|I don't want to be negative but this book was INFURIATING!!  I read the books and saw the movies to see what the fuss was about.  I'm so upset over Breaking Dawn that I'm cancelling my plans to see Eclipse in the theater because I refuse to contribute to anything Twilight anymore.  So many reviewers have written more eloquently than I can but I'd like to point out the things that drove me the most crazy: (SPOILER ALERT)    1.  Bella getting pregnant.  Lame.  And the book made it seem like raising a baby was a piece of cake.  What kind of message is this sending???      2.  Renesmee??  I cringed every time her name was mentioned, as well as her ridiculous nickname.  And if the mother objects to a nickname why would everyone continue using it?    3.  Oh god, don't even get me started on the whole imprinting baloney with Jacob.  GROSS and UGGGG!!!!    4.  Oh, and Edward asks Jacob to have sex with his wife and Jacob agrees?  What the what??    5.  The J Jenks subplot.  Bella figured out all those clues yet she's foolish enough to have human sex with a vampire and expect NO CONSEQUENCES?  Sidenote: Bella's totally gorgeous and perfect now?  Yeah, that's relateable to us readers.    6.  Jacob's just accepted into the Cullen household and everything's peaches and cream.  The blonde jokes to \\"Rose\\"?  Dumb.    7.  Emmett's sex jokes to Bella in front of her father.  Immature.  Ummm, isn't Charlie a police chief?  He doesn't ask any questions about his DAUGHTER??  Puuuuleaseeeee.  And all of a sudden he's romantically involved with the widow of his dear friend?  How convenient.  And what about Bella's MOTHER???    8.  Bella has no consequences for her actions!  She's a perfect wife and mother all of a sudden, she skips the newborn phase, Charlie turns a blind eye to her new VAMPIRE LIFE and bonus: meets a super gal so he's taken care of!, Bella uses that dumb love shield to save the day (from more boring conversation as no actually fighting ever happens), and she lives happily ever after.     9.  What happened to Team Edward vs. Team Jacob?  Edward is just a background character in Breaking Dawn.  And everyone accepts that Jacob is obsessed with the newborn child of his love interest???!    10.  The vampires are referred to as vegetarians yet THEY EAT ANIMALS!!!!  HELLO!     11.  All these new vampires that lead to what?  A nice chit chat with the Volturri.  I was actually hoping the Volturri would kill them all by the end!  That's how much I disliked this book.     My biggest problem is the message this book is sending its young, impressionable readers.  If you meet a dreamy guy (who has abandoned you in the past and you turned into a zombie/thrillseeker: see New Moon) then ditch your friends and family, get married young (even though you have no interest in marriage), get pregnant immediately, and forget any plans of college or a life of your own.  I could go on and on.  Skip this book!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I saw this in the theater with my wife.  I had read a favorable review.  We loved it.  It ought to become a \\"classic\\" family movie.  The sequel didn't live up to the original, but I tend to feel that way about many other movie sequels.  We have grandchildren now, so I wanted to add this to our disney classics and other family friendly movies.
B000URDCC6|5.0|I ordered 2 Sound of music DVDs and the products arrived on time and the quality was very good. Kudos to the seller.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Excellant service.  Product arrived in perfect condition.  I would definitely purchase more products from this seller.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Let me start off this review by stating that I have listened to the whole album multiple times before writing this. I'm not going to go into detail on every song on the album, but i'll let you guys know what my favorites and least favorite songs are. This album I believe is one of his best(if not best) albums he has came out with. This is the album fans have been looking forward to. My overall ranking of this album compared to his others goes like this: SSLP>RECOVERY>MMLP>EMINEM SHOW>ENCORE>RELAPSE. Although you can easily switch around SSLP/RECOVERY and ENCORE/REPLAPSE. Most people consider MMLP as his finest work to date, but I feel differently about the album.    It sounds as if he got his confidence back on this album. Songs like On Fire, So Bad, and Seduction all show his confidence in his rhymes compared to other rappers. The difference on this album compared to his others is that he has made a couple of songs for the ladies(Love The Way You Lie, Space Bound), which is out of his character. Me personally, I don't care for the subject matter these songs bring to the table. Those songs though aren't too bad. He does however sing on a few of these songs which I do not really have a problem with. I feel the production is pretty solid. It's nice to know he can collab with different producers and still come out with a good product.    My absolute favorite tracks on this album are:  1. 25 to Life(possibly my favorite song he has came out with)  2. Talking To Myself(song speaks for itself)  3. Cinderella Man(Going to be a good anthem song)  4. Going Through Changes(his most personal song)  5. You're Never Over(great tribute song to Proof)  6. Not Afraid(best 1st single he has came out with)    Least favorites:  1. Cold Wind Blows(lyrics were good, but nothing memorable)  2. Almost Famous(hated the hook)    Most overated song on the album:  1. Space Bound(People tend to like this song as one of their favorites on the album, but I just don't feel it. Maybe it's becauseI don't like him rapping about love.)    Overall this album is a solid 5/5. I never really rank an album that high but he has exceeded my expectations with this Recovery album. This was the best $9.99 I ever spent, album is truly worth twice as much. It's hard to say if this album is going to be classified as classic, but only time will tell.
0066620996|5.0|At a CEO Dialogues roundtable recently, leaders recommended their favorite books--or recently read books.  The list and variety is always intriguing.  Usually, it's the recommender, not the title, that causes me to succumb to Amazonitis.  I've noticed that smart people remain smart by reading smart books.<br /><br />But...what really got my attention that day was the recommendation from a CEO.  She had just re-read Jim Collins' masterpiece, Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap...and Others Don't (2001). Someone permanently borrowed my original, underlined copy, so I noticed that my new copy's header proclaims, \\"#1 Bestseller - 2 Million Copies Sold.\\" It's still relevant.<br /><br />So this CEO's insight got me thinking: How many of your younger team members have joined your organization--but have never read Built to Last, Good to Great, or How the Mighty Fall? If you're in the nonprofit or church arena, at the very least, have your direct reports (and boss or board chair) read the 36-page monograph, Good to Great and the Social Sectors.<br /><br />Is it possible that you often throw around Collins lingo--and some team members nod knowingly, while others feign understanding?  Can they finish the paragraph when you talk about a Good to Great or Built to Last concept?<br />  --The Hedgehog Concept<br />  --Clock Building, Not Time Telling<br />  --Level 5 Leadership<br />  --BHAG<br />  --The Bus<br />  --The Stockdale Paradox<br />  --Greatness at the Cleveland Orchestra<br />  --The Flywheel<br />  --The 3 Circles: Passion, Competence and Your Economic Engine (and what is different in the social sector)<br /><br />Collins says, \\"The moment you think of yourself as great, your slide toward mediocrity will have already begun.\\"  Do your vision and mission statements trumpet arrogance or humility? \\"Greatness is not a function of circumstance,\\" adds Collins. \\"Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice, and discipline.\\"<br /><br />Conduct an informal Collins poll in the hallway or break room.

B002JCSWV6|4.0|I really enjoyed this Film. I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and thought this was a very well made film. It is light enough at a time when it seems so many films lately are so serious or dark. I think Eastwood is a top notch Director and this was no exception. Kind of an innocent feel good movie in my opinion and worth watching for sure :)
B002XTBE6K|1.0|The arc of the plot is Austen.  The names of the characters.  The outlines of their relationships.    The verbal subtlety, the character detail, most especially the dialogue, are NOT AUSTEN.  Terrible, heavy handed and clumsy version of the novel. The  Frank Churchill sub-plot of the novel is vastly expanded - and not in a good way.  Jane Fairfax is insipid.  Elton and wife are not at all amusing.      Were Austen alive, she would probably ask that HER name be taken off the credits.  IT\\"S THAT BAD!!
0525423842|4.0|This was a different but interesting book. I did enjoy it but was fast reading and left me wanting MORE!!
0439023483|5.0|I don't know why I didn't want to read this series. For some reason, it just didn't appeal to me. I would hear incredible things from every single person that I talked to, but I just had this unexplained refusal to pick them up. I wish somebody would've made me read them though, because I am now hooked.<br /><br />I don't even really need to write this review. What can I say that hasn't already been said a million times? The Hunger Games is enthralling and intense. The plot is sickening but incredibly entertaining at the same time. And Katniss is a kick-ass heroin who may put up a strong front, but probably has more weaknesses than anyone else in the series.<br /><br />I love how well crafted everything is. I haven't read such a detailed and creative world since Hogwarts. The creatures, the people, the geography .. Suzanne Collins has a lot of imagination and she uses it well.<br /><br />Overall, if you've been living under a rock and haven't heard of The Hunger Games, go pick it up now. Mixing action, suspense and romance, I definitely think this is one for girls and boys.
B001HN694K|5.0|I saw this at the theater in 3D on opening day.  It was awsome.  I pre-ordered this because I knew my grandchildren would love to see it also.  This is by far, Johnny Depp at his best!  I even bought the CD Almost Alice which is also awsome.  Love this movie.
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis took an interesting twist on our recent financial crisis by focusing on the few individuals who profited tremendously by predicting it beforehand. Through his excellent prose, he makes these characters incredibly interesting while, at the same time, educating the reader on the underlying pinnings of the financial collapse. I found myself wishing to learn even more about the individuals he highlights, especially Steve Eisman and Dr. Mike Burry. The middle chapters may be a bit weak, and Lewis does not succeed in succinctly describing credit-default swaps, a great disappointment for me, and I have a relatively strong financial background. Nevertheless, certain items became very clear after completing this book: the horrible performance and ineptitude of the bond rating agencies (Moody's and S&P), the lack of due diligence and foresight by government regulators including Alan Greenspan, Henry Paulson, and Timothy Geithner, and finally, the fundamental flaw of having these large financial institutions and their employees transfer risk to shareholders by virtue of being publicly traded. Ultimately Michael Lewis succeeded in creating an engrossing and educational book, one which I recommend to anyone seeking to learn more about the truly tragic event.
0385523386|5.0|This is a firsthand account of a woman's year in Federal Prison.  It's all in there, the rules, the tears, the visits, the sex, the laughter, and the food.  Refreshingly honesty throughout, it is well written and fun to read.
B0023RSZZU|5.0|Book arrived on time and in excellent condition.  The narrator details her experiences as a transported non-Jewish child placed in the protective custody during WWII.  Far from being a story of Nazi atrocities, the book concentrates on the relationships formed between a loving \\"adopted\\" family and meaningful friendships with the hidden bonus of unlikely, but devoted friends and their mischievious youthful adventures. After the first few pages, the story grips your heart with details about a survivor in hidden by apolitcal French and ethical people putting themselves in danger to save an innocent child. A great book for book clubs of all interets.
B00005ABX0|5.0|The two singles from \\"Smiley Smile\\", \\"Good Vibrations\\" and \\"Heroes and Villains\\" are  established classics. But most of the obscure tracks hold up well too, especially \\"Fall Breaks And Back To Winter\\" with woodpecker percussive effects and the hard rocker \\"Gettin' Hungry\\", both precursors to their next album. They introduce humor into their music.<br /><br />Now for \\"Wild Honey\\", one of the greatest albums ever recorded. It's a superb collection of contemporary R&B and blue-eyed soul with its minimal instrumentation providing a warmth. Carl Wilson's passionate lead vocals on the title track and \\"Darlin\\" is a driving force of the record. And he rivals Stevie Wonder on one of Motown's best, \\"I Was Made To Love Her\\". Brian Wilson's input still casts him as a major player. His presence is particularly felt on the three most humorous cuts: \\"I'd Love Just Once To See You\\", \\"Here Comes The Night\\" and the acapella closer \\"Mama Says\\". A final must mention are their two loveliest melodies, \\"Let The Wind Blow\\" and \\"Country Air\\", replete with perfect harmonizing.
B000SEGMBO|3.0|Classic book, but the paragraphs have no indentations on the Kindle version (at least in the iPad) and the line spacing between paragraphs is the same between and within paragraphs making it all look jumbled together and unprofessional.  Other books I've gotten on the iPad look fine.
B00127RAJY|2.0|Did not think the dvd was very good.  Number of repetitions varied from exercise to exercise and even sometimes within the same exercise.  The music did not go very well.  It felt like it was added in AFTER the video was made.  Maybe there should be a clock timer that we can all see so we know that we are doing numbers based on time and not a particular set number.
B000001FZK|5.0|i'm shaking, my heart is racing, a joy untold swirls within.  happy to be alive.  proud to be human.  i think i'm in love.  thank you to the reviewer that almost begged me to buy this, i heard you and will keep listening and keep looking for music plants and animals.
0385504225|2.0|I honestly congratulate myself for finishing this book. Even with some serious skimming, it took about a week and a half to get to the end. It was almost painful to trudge through the long-winded descriptions and wooden dialogue, but the promise of a great ending (which Dan Brown has delivered before) kept me going.    Oh, how wrong I was!    The secret that the Masons were hiding was probably the dumbest thing I have ever read in a novel, and I've read some stinkers. It just made no sense. At all.    Also, the puzzles weren't as interesting this time around, the characters had really overblown dramatic reactions to every.little.thing, and what's with all the Noetic Science? That Dan Brown would spend so many valuable pages and words expounding on this theoretical science confused and bored the life out of me. The entire concept wasn't well-integrated into the novel and became a throwaway.     There were some interesting pages in the middle, but they were overshadowed by all the not-so-interesting pages everywhere else in the book.     Definitely a skip.. don't worry, you won't miss out on anything special.
B003KT3NRA|5.0|First off this is NOT a Motley Crue album! It is a Vince Neil album. So since the standard is significantly lower I would honestly tell you this is a good album for being a solo Vince Neil cover songs album with two new songs of his. Vince Neil is a decent singer live and courtesy of Protools is an excellent singer in the studio. THIS is coming from a life long Motley Crue fan. So if I am that objective about the singer of my ALL time favorite band. Than you can pretty much bank on it that I am being objective and honest about this album. I like the covers Vince has decided to do. His range is CCR to Elton John. That's fairly diverse if you ask me...       Bottom line: This album is worth the purchase but I would be caught dead paying more then 3-5 bucks for it tops. Especially because of how old it is! Thanks for reading my review.So if we are fans can honestly say that this solo album of Vince Neil's is on     average about 1/4 as good as Motley Crue as a whole than we can easily come to the     conclusion that Vince Neil as an artist did his job for the fans. And if one cannot say that     than obviously Vince Neil has failed. It's all subjective to who is giving their opinion...                         By the way people The New World Order is upon us. You better save your beer     and pot money up and spend it on your food supply, a couple of good guns and as much     gold as you can purchase... IF anyone now-a-days with all the real info out there about     9/11 still believes that 16 or 17 of 19 hijackers got through ALL of the U. S. security     completely ON their own without any help from within at least ONE of those federal govt.     agencies, just remember I have some really nice beach front property in the Midwest I'd     love to sell to you for 5 million bucks... MORONS!!! Don't you dare refer to me as anti-    America I am a U.S. Navy Veteran. So stick that in your pipe little buster brown and like it.     Enough with your cock and bull stories... PEACE!!!!!!!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|AFter Cinderella Man, this is my second favorite movie done by Crowe. Ron Howard the director and Crowe made a billiant collaboration here. All the actors were superb. No one else could have played Nash like Crowe did. He should have won an Oscar for this. I love the musical score as well. Captivating. A must see by all.
0684847248|4.0|Obviously, our parents were the two most significant human beings to guide and shape our opinions, prejudices, learning, and adoption of our worldview or outlook toward the universe.  Peck makes that clear, as he details the impact his dad had on him.  Depending upon where we went to school, which schools we attended, our religious training, whether in church or catechism or whatever, we learned from those who taught us as we grew up.      One of several individuals that have had an impact upon my thinking is M. Scott Peck--author of The Road Less Traveled.  His book's success speaks for itself.     After reading it I followed up with several of his books published afterwards including People of a Lie.  Peck was a Christian psychologist/minister/writer.  I don't know how he got tagged as being a scientist.  He defined his own place in life, not really fitting into the mainstream.  It was his thinking out of the box that attracted me to him. He is dead right when he says that as thinking creatures one stops \\"growing\\" when he or she doesn't challenge daily about everything they believe and perceive in the universe.      Peck wrote The Road Less Traveled in his late 20's and had one of those unique experiences to be able to find a publisher and publishing it.  It became an overnight success.  I enjoyed this book because he seemed to understand the human condition and wrote honestly of the struggle of good versus evil.  He believed evil existed in the universe.    By the time he had written his 5th book titled Searching for Stones, I had begun to split ways with him.  I read it shortly after it was published in 1996.  In 2007 I was spending time doing what I do fairly often--reflecting back over my past life and asking myself why I think the way I think and why I believe what I believe.  I was reviewing books, teachers, individuals, experiences, and events in life that have made me the personal mental construct that I am with my world view, habits, religious beliefs, and thoughts that make me the person I am.  While doing this I recognized that Scott Peck had a significant impact upon my thinking at a point in time starting with the Road Less Travelled.  My brother and I had shared quotes from his books through the years.  Both of us admired his writings.  But, a question lingered in my mind in 2007 as to why I moved on to other writers and his impact upon me at a point in time had diminished.  I got on Amazon.com and reviewed all of his books.  I knew that at one time I had read of an angelic appearance, as he described it.  He had called it a \\"spirit of mirth\\". I found this episode in his book Searching for Stones.       In the early 80's he had spent time with individuals who were, according to Peck, demon possessed.  One evening he was \\"accosted by a good spirit.\\"  He wordlessly asked \\"what kind of spirit it was.\\"  He speaks of waging a battle with the spirit as to whether he would let it in.  Upon doing so, He described how he was consumed with delirious laughter.    I found a reread of this book to be very sad.  In it he detailed a great deal of his inner thoughts and thinking.  While reading it dawned upon me why I had begun to set Peck's books aside in 1997 and no longer viewed him as mentor.  I no longer saw him as a teacher and mentor.  I saw him as a struggling human soul making his way through life just like all the rest of us, trying to make sense of life's experiences, who and what we are, God, religion, and purpose and meaning of life.  I believe that God uses individuals in our lives as we make our journey.  Peck's words were not written in vain.  He reached out to others attempting to help and assist them think for themselves and understand life and its mysteries.  He ended the Road Less Traveled by stating that the purpose of human existence was to become God.  By the time he wrote Searching for Stones in 1996, he said:  \\"As I reread The Road Less Traveled almost twenty years after I wrote it, I am still struck by the truth that was given me.  I am also struck by a glib quality to its certainty.  I am not as certain about many things as I used to be.\\"    It is this kind of honesty that was characteristic of Peck.  Stone's is laced with his humanity.  He exposes himself as a human being struggling with life and its meaning and mysteries just like all of us are.  It is almost as if when he grew older he realized that he walked on water at a point in time in his life.  Now, he was looking down, and found himself sinking.  I really didn't need to hear about his struggles with sex, his having sexual relations with his patients, his estrangement from his adult children, or his unfaithfulness to his wife.  I felt I saw some of the ego that creeps into the lives of most people who become \\"celebrities\\" and are fawned upon by the public.  As Bill Clinton said, \\"I did it because I could.\\"  But perhaps, I did need to read about Scott Peck's personal life.    And perhaps Scott felt a need in his life to expose his humanity to his readers and admirers, somewhat the way Paul and Peter did when they threw off their clothes and ran naked into the crowds to show they were human beings among human beings.  I just know that after I finished reading Stone's a second time, Peck ceased to be a mentor of importance in my life.  I saw him as one to pray for and a \\"brother\\" rather than a teacher at this point in my life.   I put him in a category that he had placed all his mentors in life.  He speaks of \\"having lost all his mentors in life\\" before he died in 2005.  Scott was one of my mentors at one time.  I keep his books on my shelf.  When I pick them up again to read them I see myself along the path in the journey of life, and my mind can easily drift back to what I was internally feeling and thinking when I first picked up his books to read them.  They help me recall the thinking that has laid the brick and mortar of my mental construct.  Peck will timelessly have a lot to offer anyone searchingfor meaning to life.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I love this movie!!!  I couldn't have been more excited to receive it.  I love the combo because we have a blu-ray, but alot of friends/family don't, so we can still watch with them at their homes.  The movie is just fantastic and the blu-ray quality is insane.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|In one sense, this movie adheres to all the well-established rules of the inspirational sports movie. An underdog team is inspired by a wise leader and overcomes the odds to win the championship. But the performance of Mrgan Freeman, who embodies the noble character of Nelson Mandela, elevates this film to a higher level.<br /><br />Mandela is of course the outstanding moral leader of our times. Freeman brings him vibrantly to life. None of the other characters, including Matt Damon as the captain of the South African rugby team, achieves much depth. This movie is all about Freeman and Mandela.<br /><br />Released from 27 years in prison, Mandela is elected the first president of the post apartheid South Africa -- but his nation is badly riven by hatred and inequality. He must find ways of getting beyond the past and moving forward. (Pity he was succeeded by Mbeki, a moral pygmy compared to Mandela, who denied the existence of HIV and did immense damage to his country.)<br /><br />Rugby is the game of the white minority while the black majority plays soccer and despises rugby as the game of the oppressor. South Africa is hosting the World Cup of rugby in 1995 with a team that is all white with the exception of one black player. But Mandela sees the tournament as an opportunity to rally the entire nation behind the team and finds an ally is Francois Pienaar, the captain who has a surprisingly open mind.<br /><br />There are some subplots, not very much developed. Mandela has to integrate his staff, including his security detail, which means finding a way for blacks and their former oppressors to work together.<br /><br />Another false note is the sappy song, \\"Colorblind\\" inserted midway through the movie.<br /><br />When we get to the actual games, the movie reverts to type. We hear a lot of grunting and thudding collisions of large men. The action seems slow and plodding compared to an actual rugby match.<br /><br />The movie's title comes from a Victorian poem which Freeman mumbles, sotto voce. I wish we could have heard it properly. Also, I wish the DVD had included some extras that could have included interviews with the real-life Pienaar and background about the events depicted in the movie. But there were no extras at all.<br /><br />Having said that, this is a rousing and enjoyable movie.

B0036B8MZU|4.0|I started watching this show and was a bit underwhelmed at first. It was a bit rough and seemed like the actors were a bit out of sorts, but I could also see that there was something here just below the surface. It was a feeling like \\"if they just polished this a bit it would be great\\". After getting past the first few episodes it really started getting better and more enjoyable. And then BAM!, right about the middle of the season, there is an episode where the show goes from pretty good to absolutely brilliant! I don't want to give any spoilers, but this event really comes in out of left field and kicks the show into overdrive. From the end of that episode through the end of the season every episode just gets better and better. There are twists and turns, political intrigue, betrayal, death, and blossoming love. I have to admit that some of those twists did catch me completely by surprise, and that is what a twist really should do for a show.    It was only the slightly rough start which made me give it 4 stars instead of 5, but everything after that was very much a 5 star show. Oh, and if you are a lady, chances are you will be pleased by all of the male flesh being paraded around in naught but loincloths. I got a few of the girls at the office to watch the show and they thought it was great as well, and they also now claim to be in love with Andy Whitfield saying he is \\"the hottest guy on TV\\".

0385523386|5.0|To counter some of the other reviews, the author doesn't come off to me as entitled or as attempting to portray anything other than her own experience. I do believe the book's inner flap summary sounds that way but in the actual text of the book, the author does not. She is actually very honest about taking responsibility for her actions and about expressing the emotions she experiences as she travels through different aspects of the federal justice system. It's her perspective because that's all she can write about since that's all we really know well enough to accurately portray (unlike a non-biographical account, this has a realism to it that makes reading it very smooth).  It's a very interesting story, almost an ideal mix of factual portrayals of her surroundings and interactions with her personal journey as she moves through this universe. I will agree that I found the beginning a bit dull but once she launches into the actual story behind her conviction, it becomes much more interesting. It looks more like bad editing than bad writing - on that note, there were a couple of sentences that were poorly drafted, but it isn't something a normal person would get stuck on. To be clear, this isn't a story about what it's like to survive in a really severe prison environment - but that's part of what makes this interesting and a little easier to relate to and comprehend. It's not a how-to book as to prison survival, it's not a whiny complaining, attack the system, book. Yes, there is some \\"attack the system\\" in there, but it's exactly correct and appropriate. It's a book about what a minimum security prison for women was like for this one woman, who didn't really fit the standard profile for a federal prison inmate, how she reacted to and resolved her issues with that, and how those she interacted with resolved their issues with her in this context. I read it almost in a single seating (I went to sleep and finished it up the next morning) because it is both such an easy and such a compelling read.   I would not recommend the book to anyone who feels that people involved with drug crimes or who end up in prison are terrible awful useless people as they will likely be outraged at the honest portrayal of humanity. For the rest of use mature enough to think outside the box, this is worth a read.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|When I was just 9 years old and bought my first Beatles album I had a Westinghouse record player, mono stylus & a 5-inch speaker.  The spindle could hold five records and after one finished playing the next one would drop down, you know, fully automatic.    I played by records and loved it.  Soon my parents bought a \\"stereo\\" console record player.  I learned that if you turned the balance all the way to one side on Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, the harpsichord vanished & you heard just the bass & an interesting guitar on the chorus.    Time marches to the CD era and the Beatles were new again with no pops or scratches-perfect sound forever (almost).    During this transformation with the media used to convey the music, the playback system I had always was improving.  Up to the point that today, I have a playback system with incredible detail, soundstage attributes and spectacular sonics.  I am not bragging, but the point is that the Beatles in Mono sound much, much different on this system than the old Westinghouse record player.    When the \\"Love\\" DVD audio, 5.1 mix was released, I could not believe the Beatles sounded this good.    Now in Mono a 180-degree change, mixed by the Fab Four themselves, I cannot believe how good the Beatles sound AGAIN.    I thought I knew how the Mono set would sound, flat & lifeless.  I was wrong.  A very different experience, and highly recommended.    PS:  Beware of the discounted box sets.  I bought from Amazon to get the real thing, not a cheap counterfeit set.

0061914177|2.0|I purchased this book because it offered information on personal branding and social media use and it was highly rated. After reading it, I am wondering who the \\"high raters\\" are in relation to the author. Are they his followers and friends who are already jaded by his success? Are they fellow wine aficionados who have assumed that because he knows wine, he's authored a good book? In my opinion,  this book lacks substance and fails to really offer the reader new information.     Another reviewer noted that the book reads like you are having a casual conversation with Vaynerchuk and I totally agree. It's written in a conversational style and does not offer facts, case studies or any basis that would support a new point of view. The author is essentially telling readers everything they already knew to have chosen a book on this subject. This book is definitely not a \\"how to\\". It's more of a \\"how I did it\\".  I think it's also critical to point out that Vaynerchuk had a platform of success from which to start. He did not employ his strategy with social media to build a business; he leveraged social media to expand an already successful venture. So to all of the emerging entrepreneurs looking to glean inspiration and advice from your next read, this is not the book for you.     There was one refreshing element of the text. Vaynerchuk covered the big three in social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube) but he also noted some of the less mentioned tools like Flickr, Viddler and Ustream.tv.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|Well, here it is.  After one of longer waits in the DVD era, we finally get Daria: The Complete Animated Series.  I'm not sure whether the years were spent trying to get permission for the music, but clearly they gave up at some point and just decided to not bother for all but the handful of songs for which it was absolutely necessary.  Instead we get background soundtrack music.  And what a lot of people want to know now is: Will this effect my viewing experience?    Aside from the obvious, \\"It depends who you are,\\" I'd say the answer is, in general, \\"a little.\\"  I thought, for example, that I'd miss Alice in Chains' \\"Rooster\\" during \\"The Daria Hunter,\\" or Cake's \\"Daria\\" at the end of \\"The New Kid,\\" but I really didn't.  But there are precisely two points at which the missing music IS glaring.  The first is the homage to Platoon in \\"The Daria Hunter,\\" where \\"Adagio for Strings\\" is missing.  You'd think that an instrumental composed in the 1930s would be easy enough to get, but they didn't bother, so major points off for that.  The second is \\"Daria Dance Party,\\" in which Upchuck actually implies the titles of two or three of the songs, yet all we hear is ill-suited mood music!  This is especially insulting since the most obvious missing song is \\"Love Rollercoaster\\"; not only are there two versions of the song to choose from - 1970s and 1990s - but the latter one was done for the MTV movie Beavis and Butt-head Do America.    Speaking of movies, they're both here, though (a) It's not clear why the last shouldn't have the intro that graced its world premiere (as an option) when episodes have an optional \\"Daria Day\\" intro and (b) It's not clear why the first should be out of chronological order, leaving the casual viewer wondering how Daria and her guy went from talking about whether or not they should date to being a serious months-long couple.  The extras are fun, but the Top Ten - though understandably missing the videos counted down - also cuts some of the dialogue,thus neglecting to name the #1 animated video according to MTV.  (Hint: It's Google-able, and if you know anything about music videos, you'll probably guess it correctly.)  The DVDs have other organizational issues and no commentary, but most people will get them for the show anyway.    As for the show, I must admit that before this release I'd only seen the first two seasons plus a handful of reruns on The N, reruns that featured syndication cuts that are thankfully restored here.  I'm very pleased that the show only improved since these first two seasons.  So it is a worthwhile purchase.  Just don't be surprised if a select few episodes start to circulate more on file swapping services after DVD purchasers try to find a way to hear what this DVD set doesn't have.
0553381407|4.0|This book enlightened me to the fact that some parents are truly cruel and mean to their children and some are just criminals, who destroy a child's life before they can run away.

There are many ranges of hurt out there but if someone is looking to understand cruel and mean parents, especially child abusers, this may help.

0061564893|3.0|See a review of this book by Diogenes. This is not a review of the book, but rather a hint for folks like Diogenes who like to check the genealogy of historical claims. I admire Diogenes' review because he or she uses sound method to evaluate the historical claims in the book. Some of these claims involve carbon dates (more precisely, \\"radiocarbon\\" dates) and the interpretation thereof, and are relevant to critical readers on both sides of this or any other historical issue that invokes radiocarbon dates.  Radiocarbon dates are estimates of the date in which a substance stopped absorbing carbon (mostly atmospheric carbon) from the environment. Radiocarbon dates are incapable of telling you what specific year that may have been because radiocarbon dates are statistical measurements. The precision of the radiocarbon date varies according to the device used to measure it and the size of the sample. An accelerator mass spectrometer can measure plus or minus 30 years or so. A conventional counter can measure plus or minus 90-125 years, usually more if the sample was small or the counter wasn't particularly sensitive. It's also important that the precision is reported at 68% confidence, which means there's a 32% chance that the actual date is older or newer than the measured date. Anytime someone reports a radiocarbon date as a specific year, you can be absolutely sure they are abusing the radiocarbon dating process or they are ignorant of it. Menzies' date of 1590 and the Museum's reported date of 1681 are not likely to be statistically different since their 95% confidence intervals undoubtedly overlap a lot. So even if Menzies had cited his source correctly, he used radiocarbon ages incorrectly, and his 1590 date can only be distinguished from the Museum's 1681 date if you use radiocarbon dates in ways that invalidate them.  It's also important to know that radiocarbon dates are measured and reported in radiocarbon years, and not calendar years. It is possible to calibrate radiocarbon years to calendar years. Deviation of radiocarbon years from calendar years can be significant. This is because radiocarbon age varies significantly because the amount of C14 in the atmosphere varies significantly as a result of solar activity and absorption of \\"dead\\" carbon. \\"Dead\\" is carbon from substances that are older than about 25,000-30,000 years or so. You find dead carbon in limestone, oil, and coal. Increasing use of coal in the Industrial Revolution released increasing amounts of dead carbon into the atmosphere. Radiocarbon ages from the last 400 years or so therefore are artificially old because they have artificially high dead carbon in them. A radiocarbon date from the late 1600s to and one from 1950 will calibrate to nearly identical ranges of calendrical dates, and therefore are indistinguishable. If you were to calibrate Menzies' date, its calendrical dates will overlap the Museum's calendrical date by at least several decades, depending on whether it was measured with a spectrometer.   The bottom line of this is that not only does Mezsies' source apparently not back him up, even if it did, his claim would be unsustainable because radiocarbon dating is virtually always too imprecise to be used as evidence to support a historical claim about an event in a specific year.  The only time it is useful is when the year in question does not fall within the calibrated range of the date, in which case the most you can say is that it is statistically likely that the date of the event is older than the lower limit of the range or newer than the upper limit of the range.

Since I have installed mine, I only have a tempature rise of 6C, mine goes from 29C to the most of 35C, which from what I read of others is really good. And I am only using one fan on the unit, I could use two, but I don't even need it. They provide the clips in case you do however.

B000FGGE68|3.0|It's Milla Jovovich kicking tail.  [[ASIN:B00005JL3A Yet]] [[ASIN:0800195175 again]], and most likely in the nude at one point.  She plays Violet, a expert killer in middle of a futuristic war between the corporate jerks and the infected jerks she's working with called the Hemophages; she is also a Hemophage, one with the ability change her hair color, control her own gravity, and pulling weapons literally out of thin air (the movie never bothers going into details about those).  Violet was ordered on a mission to apprehend a product, which is actually a boy, and then the woman decided to protect the boy from the people who used to be on her side as well as the corporate jerks who caused her to be infected.  Wait a second...'A female expert assassin had a change-of-heart and wanted to protect a child from people who wanted to kill it or use it?' Oh no, it's [[ASIN:B0007P0Y7C Elektra]] again.  But unlike the necklace girl from that movie, the boy in \\"Ultraviolet\\" knew how to keep his mouth and himself out of trouble.<br /><br />The story tended to borderline between nonsensical and stupid.  Stupidity was given by the enemies, who has the tenacity to wear glass as armor and always charging towards Violet, only to hit each other (what is this, Looney Tunes?). The plot holes are plenty in this film, like why does the big baddie need the boy when he mentioned to have clones of the child or how Violet was rescued that one incident in the park when she's surrounded by enemies?  It was such a rush job, even the visual effects were tacky, especially the glossy backgrounds and that one shot when the entire city is made of blocks (not to mention the wall-riding scene that's straight out of \\"Night Watch\\").  For what it's worth, \\"Ultraviolet\\" served well enough as popcorn entertainment, albeit a forgettable one. It has some decent fights (bloodless for an Unrated version, though), and I did sorta grew fond of Violet and the boy, even though Violet is basically depicted as a mean, hostile woman.e woman.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|I posted a question on Facebook asking what movie I should see, listing a couple of choices.  \\"Shutter Island\\" being one of them.  The overriding feedback all led to the eerie thriller starring Leonardo Dicaprio.  Of course I never really listen to anyone, so I chose another movie and ended up having to drink a couple glasses of scotch just to get through it.  Since I was blowing off the entire day I decided to take a shot on the horror classic remake, and to my surprise found it absolutely wonderful.  I am surprised at some of the negative reviews since I thoroughly enjoyed this film.<br /><br />With most movies I pride myself on being able to predict the surprise twists or endings, but I have to admit, with this one I was totally shocked.  Leo is a freakishly tuned in investigator being sent to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a psychiatric resident.  The island is a home for people who are not of sound mind.  The issue isn't as much about the disappearance of a lost woman, as it focuses more on the questionable practices of the island hospital staff.  It seems they might be conducting some freakish Nazi type experiments on a few of the patients.  Can we say \\"water-boarding\\"?  Wait that is torture, anyway.........<br /><br />Leo teams up with his new partner Mark Ruffalo and the two of them start deciphering the clues left by former doctors and some of the unstable residents.  If there ever was a reason not to smoke a cigarette, other than the cancer thing of course, I have now discovered that doctors sometimes lace them with narcotics.  Never trust a German doctor who attempts to hide his accent.  Sadly we quickly discover that Leo has some ulterior motives for taking the case as well.  Apparently his wife was killed by an arsonist, who happens to be living in one of the cell blocks.<br /><br />So the movie meanders along, finding clue after clue and just when you think you know what is happening, bam, somebody hits you in the stomach and throws the entire plot and story into a frenzy.  I admit again, I had no idea where the movie was headed.  The only issue I had with the movie was believing some of the staff really went that far to freak old Leo out.  It makes sense to go the extra mile but hiding out in a cave with the only access coming from the side of a cliff, might require me to be paid more than a little overtime.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed the film, and I would highly recommend seeing it.  It was a pleasant surprise in more ways than one.  Set aside the believability issues and you have a fantastic movie.  Even when you add them back to the equation, you have a very entertaining flick that will keep you guessing.

B0000041A9|3.0|I wholeheartedly agree with the five stars for this performance.  The synergy between Rostropovich and Richter is uncanny at times.  I have nothing new to add on that score that has not already been said.  Why three stars, then?  The production.  These recordings were originally made in the early sixties.  Sonata 3 in the UK in 1961, sonatas 2&4 in Austria in 1962, sonatas 1&5 in the Netherlands in 1966.  They were remastered and released in 1994.  Philips has a reputation for quality recordings, but whoever worked on these dropped the ball.  The first sound you hear when the cd begins is not beautiful music, but a high, harsh hissing that remains active throughout the recordings.  This at times distracts from the Pianissimo passages, and is absolutely disruptive of the Pianissimissimo passages, with the softest of notes blending into the hiss.    Now, that having been said, if you are someone who can filter out background noise, then this might not be an issue at all.  If you are sensitive to such noises, and prefer crystal clarity to your recordings, then this one might well disappoint, as it did with me.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|I admit I've had to listen to this album more than a few times to fully appreciate it.  She dabbled here before with \\"A Body Acoustic\\" and I mostly tossed it aside, except for the two new songs.  It was good, but I just didn't want a re-hash of her best songs.  It's a great album for a new fan.  I've been a fan since 1984, so digesting a genre I don't normally listen to wasn't easy at first.    I also realized that since I'm not listening to \\"Pop/Rock\\", my equalizer wasn't set right.  When I switched it to Lounge or Jazz, it made a difference.  The clarity of her voice comes through in front of the music without the extra treble and the emotions behind it shine.  I can't give it 5 stars right now, but can't say for sure I wouldn't change my mind later.  First off, I've got to give her some credit for production.  We know she's behind every aspect (even if she isn't credited with arrangements, fans know her hands are in it) and she selected amazing musicians.  The music is top-notch from beginning to end.  One song in particular brings out the old Cyndi we all know - \\"Don't Cry No More\\".  My first listen, I thought it was my least favorite song.  After seeing it performed on Good Morning America, I wondered why her vocals came through so much better.  I've always thought she sounds best live, but that's when I also thought the equalizer might need adjustment at home.  This song has become a favorite now.  Is it blues?  Not as much as the rest of the album, but sits nicely in the middle and showcases the voice that made \\"Girls Just...\\" a staple.  My favorites: \\"Shattered Dreams\\" is reminiscent of her \\"At Last\\".  \\"Romance in the Dark\\" took awhile to grow on me, but it showcases some sultry vocals.  \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" shares some low, raspy vocals with Ann Peebles and sounds like Blues from decades ago.  \\"Down So Low\\" mixes sweet and strong like one of her classic ballads.  \\"Early in the Morning\\" and \\"Just Your Fool\\" are both just plain fun to listen to.  But, I will say \\"Just Your Fool\\" is the weakest vocally, while \\"Early\\" with the legendary B.B. King is another standout for me.    The duets with Lang are probably my least favorite.  I'm not knocking the guy - he's got a good voice for this music, but I want more from her.  As much as \\"Crossroads\\" is an amazing song, their duet just doesn't sit well with me.  I can appreciate what they were going for, but it missed its mark a bit.  I prefer \\"How Blue Can You Get\\".  The live (cut-short) performance on Regis was great.     \\"Mother Earth\\" has great piano work by Allen Toussaint and I love the lyrics.  Cyn did well with it, but this was another that took some time to grow on me.  I think she should've taken the vocals in a slightly different direction.  \\"Down Don't Bother Me\\" is just good.  It, too, is growing on me, but sounds almost country-ish.  All in all, this is a fine effort from an awesome artist!  Blues isn't my genre, so I think that's my only real problem with the album.  I do think this can earn her a Grammy nom in the Blues category.  I think she deserves it.  There are moments of vocal brilliance throughout.  And she's long overdue for a comeback.  Maybe showing her versatility and taking a risk at something so not-commercial will win her some accolades.  Some non-commercial albums have won \\"Album of the Year\\".  In any event, she's still my favorite singer and this album further proves that she can sing anything!

0385737947|5.0|I loved this novel.  The idea of a young boy thrown into a \\"prison colony\\" where neither he nor any of the other boys remember their life before is intriguing.  Overall it reminded me of Lord of Flies, but without following the exact same plot line.  It was entertaining to follow the story as the hero attempts to fit into the society of the Maze Dwellers and to crack the mystery of the Maze itself.  The ending was GREAT and unforeseen and I cannot wait to read the next installment in the trilogy

B003HLM2QO|1.0|This is coming form a Black Sabbath and an Ozzy lover:    I was actually looking forward to this cd, and when it came in the mail I immediately opened it and put it onto my Zune.  After it was loaded, I gave it a listen, and was immediatlety disappointed.    It's important to realize here that Ozzy's band has drastically changed.  Gone are Zack Wylde and the ex-Faith No More drummer extraordinare Mike Borden (who is actually touring with FNM currently).  With those changes in mind, NONE of the songs on here have any real soul to them; they sound well-produced and performed, but they are just \\"empty\\" sounding, as if Ozzy and the musicians are just going through the motions.  As I listened to each track, I became more and more upset - after all this is an OZZY album, right?!  Usually there's one or two CLASSIC tracks on each of his efforts, but not on this one.  Again, the entire work just sounds empty and heartless; there's no real memorable songs here, nothing to even tap your foot to, and THAT is the real disappoint ment here.  (Note: I will NOT compare this cd to Black Rain, because I do not remember that album that much; I will hoever say that I remembered enjoying it MUCH more than this, and that I listened to that album several times).    In short, pass on this.  Even if you are an Ozzy fan.
B003RGTIIY|1.0|Karoke covers at their best, I've heard better in bars. Who'll Stop The Rain is PAINFUL to listen to...WHY VINCE WHY?!?!?!?!
B002VZC9CY|3.0|Some of the album is good; most is monotone and boring.  Her voice is still the same but some of the pizzaz is gone.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Perfect story about waiting and second chances.  Screenplay as good as the Amada Root version, although a bit different in places.  Wonderful scenery and ambiance.  Moving portrayal of love thwarted, then ultimately regained.  Searing vision of stifling social mores of another era.  Beautiful cinematography and incorporation of music in all the right places.  He's gorgeous; she's charming.  What's not to like?
B0000DZTIW|5.0|This is probably one of my all time favorite Movie Scores.It is epic and emotional and while watching The Last Samurai,i was some times almost in tears...\\"Some measure of peace\\" is achingly beautiful.And i can picture the scene when the Japanese woman is \\"dressing \\"Tom Cruise in the Samurai Outfit...Beautiful Movie and Score!
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Completely satisfied with purchase from vendor. DVD arrived in excellent condition. You would have never known it had been used. The disk and the other printed materials and game pieces were  perfect condition. Arrival time and delivery was fast. My grandson is so happy to see the Dumbo story and will enjoy for many years to come.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|My Dad bought this for me and all i can say is this movie is fantastic!!! If you like fantasy or sci fi, you will love this!!! Everything was put together so well...the scenery, the characters, the storyline....just everything. Wanted to hop right in and go there!!! :)
B003PYAB6Q|5.0|I grew up during the New Wave boom, but it never really hooked me. My taste in music is geared toward hardcore, death and thrash metal with a bit of classic rock and blues thrown in. I heard Devo play \\"Fresh\\" on a late night talk show and the song caught my attention. After listening to a few songs, I was hooked and had to own this record!    Now I have these MP3s in my iTunes along with my Slayer, Naplam Death, Iron Maiden, and Sepultura songs. Something For Everybody indeed! If this album can turn a guy like me into a DEVO fan, then it can hook anybody. The songwriting is that good.
B000O77RLE|1.0|I try to purchase all movies Clint Eastwood has any thing to do with. The problem with this movie is I do not speak nor do I understand Japanese. I feel AMAZON.COM should have printed in large type along with the movie advertisement that the dialog for this movie is all spoken in Japanese. Therefore for my use this production rates ZERO stars, but you force me to pick at least one star in order to submit my comments.  PS - I notice one of your criteria for submitting a review is \\"are you over 13?\\"  I am 72.
B0006213WG|5.0|I have a list of my favorite albums ever created: It starts off with The Beach Boy's 'Pet Sounds', next comes The Beatle's 'Sgt Pepper', third is Bob Dylan's 'Blonde On Blonde'...all classics from any music lovers standpoint. My fourth all time favorite is without a doubt 'Chuck' by Sum 41. Yes, somewhat odd that I'd have a California harmony group, the fab four, and Rock's most prominent lyricist/musician lined up with Sum 41, but here's why:<br /><br />'Chuck' is a message straight from the heart. It deals with life and death, love and hate. The chorus' are just fantastic. Every song has a killer hook. It is punk music (and a twist of metal here and there) but the lyrics and the melodies make it so much more.<br /><br />Many Sum 41 fans dislike 'Chuck' because it isn't punk enough....sorry folks but you have to move out of mothers basement sometime! Seriously, bands evolve; GREAT bands evolve towards maturity...'Chuck' shows a side of Sum 41 that is human...we have all lost someone, we have all loved at some point, we have all probably been near death. Sum 41 puts all this angst in a musical form. There is NO filler on this album. Listen to 'I'm Not The One' or 'Pieces' or 'Slipping Away' or 'There's No Solution' or 'Some Say'...this is far beyond five star material!<br /><br />To the one-star reviewer who wrote that Sum 41 'copied' the chords from Coldplays 'The Scientist' and made it into 'Pieces': There are about 10,000 songs out there that use that exact same chord progression...If no one was allowed to copy chord progression the amount of music out there would be nill.<br /><br />Every song on here is a knockout. I love basically every type of music out there; from Vivaldi to Eminem, from The Doors to Au Revoire Simone...I have listened to countless albums, but I can honestly say that 'Chuck' is one of the best I've ever heard.<br /><br />'Chuck' shows a musical and lyrical maturity - a great departure from Sum 41's previous albums. If you want punk music, pick up some Ramones...if you want an album that sounds like a message straight from the heart I 100% recommend 'Chuck'.<br /><br />5/5bum that sounds like a message straight from the heart I 100% recommend 'Chuck'.    5/5
0307454541|1.0|A friend read this book and I am posting her review for her:<br /><br />An earlier review on Amazon stated it was as if a different author finished this book - I agree. That, or the author became bored part way thru and just finished it in a hurry. I was diappointed, expected much more, nothing clever here, move on.

B0030Y11XS|3.0|An interesting satire on the economy clash of 2008..but just like any other set of intertwined opinions, this one also needs to be taken a pinch of salt. It does tells us about capitalism and corporations and how it has all resulted in the current issues. But keep in mind that every system, be it capitalism, socialism, or a mix, has its own pros & cons. Anything when taken to its extreme will result in out-of-control situations. Thus, it won;t be fair to say that the system was bad..rather the way it was operated was bad.<br /><br />Anyway, this DVD is worth to keep in your shelf for future generations to show them the lessons learned and mistakes to be avoided.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|We couldn't be happier! Not only did it come early but it is just as they said, New the price was phanominal. Don't hesitate to purchase from these people. I know that when it is time for more movies I will check with them first!
6305212112|5.0|You know what?  I'm ashamed of myself.  I'm ashamed over the fact that in the back of my mind for SO many years now, I assumed Fried Green Tomatoes is a chick flick.  A film only women can understand and appreciate.  This is the reason I avoided it for so many years.    A chick flick? NOT AT ALL!  This is actually a really good family movie, or an incredibly moving emotional drama if you wish.      The reason everyone loves Fried Green Tomatoes is because it does absolutely everything right.  The happy scenes make you feel happy, the sad scenes make you wanna grab a tissue, and the angry scenes... yeah you get the idea.   It's true though, and whenever a movie is able to move the viewer in such a way that they themselves feel the same emotions as the characters on screen, *that* my friends is how you know you're watching a fantastic and brilliantly executed storyline.    Kathy Bates all by *herself* makes the overall rating shoot up a few points.  That's how fondly I think of her as an actress. She's just absolutely terrific every single time I watch her performance no matter WHAT the storyline is about.  She completely amazes me time and time again.  In Fried Green Tomatoes, you get to witness Kathy Bates go through several experiences as she portrays a normal housewife just looking for something to spice up her life.  Looking for something to take away the redundant-ness.    The storyline is about Kathy's character making constant visits to an old woman in a retirement home, and getting to know the old woman a little bit more with each visit.  Kathy eventually visits the old woman enough times that Kathy's personality begins to change (just WAIT until you see a really hilarious scene involving a parking lot incident!!)    However, the meat and potatoes of the storyline is a personal, life changing story that the old woman shares with Kathy.   It's a story involving the old woman reflecting on her younger years as she goes through her child, teenager, and adult life.      As the story the old woman tells unfolds more and more, you not only get to know the old woman better, but you see how her stories are affecting Kathy Bates character as well.  WHAT a story she tells too.  Wow!    Also, the production of this film is amazing.  It seriously does NOT look like it's 20 years old- it feels like it's about 5 years old.  Nothing about the picture looks dated to me.  Just a wonderful job there.    Yes, this movie truly deserves the many perfect 5 star ratings it has received here on amazon.  I'm still angry at myself for avoiding such a classic film for... geez, nearly 20 years now.  That's just pure stubbornness right there, haha.   Don't wait 20 *years* like I did!!  Watch this movie tonight.
0307341550|5.0|Tom Wolfe asserted that \\"you can't go home again\\" and it is true that you won't be able to recapture your youth, or many friendships and relationships that only exist back in your memories, but Gillian Flynn teaches us that you can go home again, but that's not always a good thing.<br /><br />This is an excellent character study of a young girl who finds how easily the bad things in your youth can still haunt you in an instant. No matter how secure in an adult, professional, confident world, when confronted when the dark things from one's past, you find yourself instantly back \\"home\\" again. Think of the many episodes of talk shows where someone confronts a school bully 15 years later and finds themselves in tears. Or the reunion reality shows where the nerds instantly feel put down and unworthy in relation to the popular crowd.<br /><br />The mystery was good enough to keep my interest, but it wasn't the star here. Camille is the star. And she finds herself slowly unable to resist the gravity of the monsters of her youth.<br /><br />Ms. Flynn teases us with cliches and then pulls then out from under us, masterfully in Camille's relationships.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book on my shelf by this author, Dark Places.

B002VPE1AW|2.0|The first half of the movie is promising, but the second half fades into a fairly ordinary action film.    Many of the reviewers seemed so impressed with the technical elements of the movie that they were willing to overlook this weakness in the development of the story, but I felt even more disappointed that the filmmakers lost control of promising material.      Except for its technical aspects, a truly ordinary movie.
055350259X|5.0|Bill Bryson is a genius. He tells a phenomenal story that is humorous and entertaining. While at the same time he gives us lessons in history, geography, science, and world events. His talent with words and descriptions is amazing.   I read the book first and a laughed all the way through. The audio is no different.   Keep writing, Bill. There are a bunch of us who love you.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|Hard to believe, but this is only the second time that I watched this marvellous shapeless flawed jewel of a failed master piece. I thought I must have watched it a dozen times. How else can I have told and quoted scenes and dialogues for the last 10 years? Imagine the surprise when details turn out differently from expectations, or rather from imagined recollections.<br />This is surely not the best movie ever made by the Coens, but it is such great fun.<br />What did the Dude say after 5 dips of his head in the toilet bowl, asked where the money was? Let me have another look, it must be in there somewhere. Or something like that.<br />What did he say when the gangster shows him the bowling ball and asks: what is this? No, he does not say: can't you see it is a golf ball. He says what I put in the headline.<br /><br />What made me watch it again today? First of all, watching Bridges as Bad Blake yesterday reminded me that I wanted to revisit Lebowski since some time. Second, I had a discussion in a comment thread around here about the fact that comedies age. Some that I remembered as hilarious from decades ago, like Polanski's vampire joke, or like Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, have on revisit turned out to have become stale. I wanted to check if Lebowski is stale already. Good news: it isn't! But it is a mess of a movie. Never mind, invest two hours of your time and enjoy it!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar is a spectacular film. The way it's directed, written, and cast is phenomenal.   Many are very annoyed that it came out without and bonus material. But it's alright.  I would suggest ordering this one so you have the original version. The version that is due to come out later this year is going to be extended with new footage and extra material. I purchased this set and I am planning to buy the new one as well.  When James Cameron's Titanic was released on DVD, it too came out with just the film. But then came out again with a new edition that had extended scenes and even new one. There were still even deleted scenes after the extension.     I still must say that you need you get this version. This version is now a limited time offer.     Plus, if Cameron releases Avatar like he did with Titanic, it could get pricy. Titanic came out in a $60 set when it was rereleased. So, you may not even have the money to get it. That's why I suggest getting this one now just in case.    Thanks for reading. Please don't post rude comments, because this is my opinion. Except it really is just a limited time only so BUY SOON!!
0060558121|5.0|What a wonderful book!  Hefty, compelling, hard to put down, rich on so many levels -- imagine great literature where you admired the protagonist and thrilled to the story, or imagine Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" full of literary and cultural allusions, philosophical depth, better dialog and no slow patches.  Certainly this is one of the best novels and funnest reads that I have ever come across.
0545123275|3.0|I have a certain fondness for friendly werewolf stories---hey, werewolves TOTALLY make better boyfriends than vampires!  So, I was pre-disposed to like this book---however,  the manuscript certainly does have problems with internal logic. (I'm not sure how much of this I would have noticed if I hadn't first read a few less-than-stellar reviews. I mean, I would like to think that I would have been aware of some of the book's shortcomings, but let's face it---I'm often not as astute as I could be and if I'm taken with a story I may perhaps overlook some flaws that are obvious to others.)<br /><br />The biggest problem with this book, a hurdle I couldn't ignore, is that the whole changing-to-a-wolf process doesn't seem to be very well thought out. It never is explained very clearly, only that when it gets cold, werewolves go feral. Um, okay... But let's look at the facts---if:<br /><br />1. When it gets cold, you turn into a wolf<br />2. You can only change so many times, before you become a wolf for good<br />3. You don't WANT to be a wolf, you want to be human<br /><br />Doesn't it logically follow, then, that you simply need to move to a warmer climate? I felt like shouting \\"You morons, if you don't want to be wolves why are you living in one of the coldest states in the union when there are thousands of other places you could live in the US where you would be just fine?! (Okay, I was kind of exasperated by that.)<br /><br />There were a lot of other little logical hiccups as well which were constant little irritations. All the medical stuff seemed way off base---for instance, I believe that any gunshot wound in Minnesota is immediately reported to the police by the hospital staff, by law. So the whole idea of Sam waltzing in and out of the hospital to get stitched up without attracting even the least bit of attention seemed a bit of a stretch. Also, Grace's parents were so VERY absent from the whole story as to be ludicrous. I mean, why didn't the author simply write her as a freshman in college, living on her own in a tiny little flat---would have made a lot more sense than having her a high school student with conveniently non-existent parents.<br /><br />Another problem was that the story was told in chapters alternating between Sam and Grace's point of view, but each voice sounded exactly the same. Plus, the writing contained some rather clumsy descriptive passages and ungainly metaphors. Now, I don't necessarily think that Maggie Stiefvater is a poor writer---after all, she also wrote Lament, which I had mentioned in a previous review and which I found very involving on an emotional level (despite a few problems with logic in that manuscript as well). It's just that I think this book needed more polishing; some of this material simply didn't work. So, a mixed review from me on this one.  Still, I enjoyed it enough that I'll likely try reading the sequel to see what happens next.on her own in a tiny little flat---would have made a lot more sense than having her a high school student with conveniently non-existent parents.

1594488878|5.0|Easily Hornby's best novel since \\"About a Boy.\\"  He mixes his familiar topics of relationships and music, but this time looks at them from the less familiar pespective of people who have aged and are looking back on their lives with regret.  Despite that seemingly depressing theme, the book has all the funny and witty dialogue that you've come to expect from Hornby.  Definitely worth reading.
B001FB5634|3.0|My friends read the book so we all watched the movie together and they said they thought the book was better. They also said that the boy in the movie was a little b**ch compared to the one in the book. The man was constantly carrying him everywhere. I mean come on. If I was dying a slow and painful death I wouldnt carry my 10 year old son everywhere. I mean the kid actually was really annoying. All he could say was \\"papa' and \\"ok\\". Viggo did a great job. It was definitly a award deserving performance. Also they made Charlize Theron seem like a real jerk in the movie. Which sucks because I like her as an actor. After the movie we just sat their and discussed why people were missing their thumbs. That is what we came away with. If you read the book you sjould watch the movie. But personaly just go buy I AM LEGEND. It is a far better movie but again THE ROAD is ok.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I bought this, and another DVD (Underworld 3) on a whim, based on reviews and descriptions. Comparing these two, Outlander definitely wins out. It was good action and nice CGI, not too mushy, and good, solid characters within the narrow range that is usually allotted to your friendly neighbourhood action characters.     The main topic, a spaceman crash landing in the viking era, is in itself very promising. I also found I liked the way they explained it in the bonus disk, about how this could actually be the event on which Beowulf. There are zillions of ways of looking at old myths and epics, and why should this explanation be less plausible than some others?     The plotline was somewhat predictable, if you are familiar with the rote action movies - \\"tortured\\" hero who has a killed wife and child in his past, a local woman, or better even, a local WARRIOR (read: Mary Sue) woman, an old and wise man, a hothead heroic sidekick-character, and a demonic menace. I guess you can already guess what happens to each of them? You probably guess correctly. No real surprises there.     A BIG mistake was IMHO naming a character Boromir. Egads. If they felt the need to use a Tolkienish name, why not take one from Rohan, where they really had Germanic names which would have suited perfectly? Why an Elvish-based name which stood really out like a pink polka-dotted elephant?     And as regards the bonus disk: oddly, while I liked to see all that additional material, making of and deleted scenes, I found the fact that they even bothered filling a whole disk with bonuses way too pretentious. This is no big hit movie to require such self-aggrandisement.     Okay, so I've written a lot about how this was not a good movie - but it wasn't all that bad, really. Mostly, I liked it. It was nice entertainment, and someday I'll probably put it into my DVD player again. :) If you're not looking for anything serious, this might just suit your taste.
1594202559|4.0|Sebastian Mallaby, a former correspondent for The Economist magazine, is clear on where he stands on the issue of hedge funds regulation. He is against it. With the possible exception of a few systemically significant funds, he thinks regulation would bring more harm than good, and that there are more pressing concerns for fixing the global financial system. Not that hedge funds are a sideshow. Mind you, they manage close to two trillion dollars, and their management style and compensation practices tend to define the zeitgeist on the trading floors of financial institutions. Hedge funds are cool: as Mallaby shows, they are definitely the place to be for smart people bent on making serious money, or for those with the ambition to rewrite the rules of financial theory.<br /><br />Hedge funds are defined by four characteristics: they stay under the radar screen of regulatory authorities; they charge a performance fee; they are partially isolated from general market swings; and they use leverage to take short and long positions on markets. Most importantly, in a financial system riddled with conflicts of interests and skewed incentives, hedge funds get their incentives right. As a result, according to Mallaby, they do not wage any systemic threat to the financial system, and they may even provide part of the solution to our post-crisis predicament.<br /><br />The first set of well-aligned incentives deals with the issue of ownership. Hedge fund managers mostly have their own money in their funds, so they are speculating with capital that is at least partly their own--a powerful incentive to avoid losses. By contrast, bank traders generally face fewer such restraints: they are simply risking other people's money.<br /><br />Partly as a consequence, the typical hedge fund is far more cautious in its use of leverage than the typical bank. The average hedge fund borrows only one or two times its investors' capital, and even those that are considered highly leveraged borrow less than ten times. Meanwhile, investment banks such as Goldman Sachs or Lehman Brothers were leveraged thirty to one before the crisis, and commercial banks like Citi were even higher by some measures. As Mallaby notes, hedge funds are paranoid outfits, constantly in fear that margin calls from brokers or redemptions from clients could put them out of business. They live and die by their investment returns, so they focus on them obsessively.<br /><br />The second set of incentives deals with how hedge funds operate. They are usually better managed than investment banks. Their management culture tends to encourage team spirit and collaborative work as much as individual performance. Alfred Winslow Jones, the originator of the first hedge fund and the \\"big daddy\\" of the whole industry, invented a set of management tools and compensation practices to get the most from his brokers and managers. These innovations quickly paid off: whereas investors usually waited for company filings to arrive in a bundle from the post office, Jones' employees were stationing at the SEC's offices to read the statements the moment they came out. At a time when trading was considered a dull, back-office task, not something that a brilliant analyst would get involved with, Michael Steinhardt, another pioneer of the industry, would sit on his own trading desk and initiate the trading of large blocks of stocks with the seniority to risk millions on his personal authority.<br /><br />Other funds introduced a more scholarly approach to management. At the Commodities Corporation, which combined econometric modeling and chart reading, anyone who blew half of his initial capital had to sell all his positions and take a month off. He was required to write a memo to the management explaining his miscalculations. At LTCM, John Meriwether recruited young PhDs and encourage them to stay in touch with cutting-edge research; they would visit finance faculties and go out on the academic conference circuit. At Renaissance Technologies, the holding company of the flagship fund Medallion, Jim Simons gathered a team of mathematicians, astronomers, code breakers and computer translation experts that were so well ahead of the curve that they gave up reading academic finance journals altogether. Their office spaces bore signs claiming that \\"the best research never gets published\\" and papers explaining \\"why most published research findings are wrong\\".<br /><br />Hedge funds have a powerful incentive to improve upon existing knowledge, and market practitioners have often been ahead of academic theorists. They poked holes in the efficient-market theory long before the hypothesis came into disrepute among researchers. As Mallaby notes, innovation is often ascribed to big theories fomented in universities and research parks. But the truth is that innovation frequently depends less on grand academic breakthroughs than on humble trial and error--on a willingness to go with what works, and never mind the theory that may underlie it. A.W. Jones, the founder of the industry, had anticipated the rules of portfolio selection before Harry Markowitz formalized them in 1952. By the time William Sharpe proposed a simple rule for calculating the correlation between each stock and the market index in 1963, Jones had been implementing his advice for more than a decade.<br /><br />The most important set of incentives is that hedge funds are not too big to fail, and therefore they do not cast systemic risk over the stability of the whole market. The great majority of hedge funds are too small to threaten the broader financial system. They are safe to fail, even if they are not fail-safe. There is no precedent that says that the government stands behind them. Even when LTCM collapsed in 1998, the Fed oversaw its burial but provided no taxpayer money to cover its losses. By contrast, the recent financial crisis has compounded the moral hazard at the heart of finance: Banks that have been rescued can be expected to be rescued all over again the next time they blow up; because of that expectation, they have weak incentives to avoid excessive risks, making blowup all too likely.<br /><br />According to Mallaby, some of the perverse incentives that banks face come from regulation. Rather than running their books in a way that rigorous analysis suggests will be safe, banks sometimes run their books in a way that the capital requirements deem to be safe, even when it isn't. By contrast, hedge funds are in the habit of making their own risk decisions, undistracted by regulations and the false security provided by credit ratings. As a result, the hedge fund sector as a whole survived the subprime crisis extraordinarily well. By and large, it avoided buying toxic mortgage securities and often made money by shorting them.<br /><br />As Mallaby shows, hedge funds are a diverse lot. Following the fall of Askin Capital Management in 1994, George Soros declared to a Congress hearing that \\"there is as little in common between my type of hedge funds and the hedge fund that was recently liquidated as between the hedgehog and the people who cut the hedges in the summer.\\" Nowadays hedge funds operate in merger arbitrage, long/short equity investing, credit arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, subprime assets, and all the other segments of market investment. And yet hedge funds have been equally vilified, mostly by people, institutions, and countries that stand at the other end of their investment strategies. Conversely, as Mallaby notes, \\"the countries that like hedge funds the best are also the ones that host them.\\" One may also conjecture that countries that use hedge funds for their sovereign wealth investments will also develop a liking for them, as did universities endowments and other institutional investors looking for higher returns.<br /><br />I read this book after a series of popular essays on financial markets and the recent subprime crisis. I have no direct knowledge of the hedge fund or banking sector, and no practical experience of portfolio management. The names and faces of the people presented in the picture portfolio were all unfamiliar to me, with the possible exception of George Soros. More Money Than God therefore provided a useful introduction to a set of financial institutions that often appear collectively in the news, but that are not commonly analyzed as distinct managing entities or put in a historical perspective. Sebastian Mallaby revisits key episodes of recent financial history, from the Black Monday market crash of October 19, 1987, to the breakup of the sterling peg in 1992, the attacks on the Thai baht during the Asian crisis of 1997, the LTCM collapse in 1998, and the less well-reported quant quake of August, 2007.<br /><br />As of the debate whether hedge funds should be regulated or not, although I tend to err on the side of regulation in general terms, I must confess that Mallaby presents cogent arguments, and I am convinced that his voice will have to be reckoned with in future discussions on the matter.next time they blow up; because of that expectation, they have weak incentives to avoid excessive risks, making blowup all too likely.     According to Mallaby, some of the perverse incentives that banks face come from regulation. Rather than running their books in a way that rigorous analysis suggests will be safe, banks sometimes run their books in a way that the capital requirements deem to be safe, even when it isn't. By contrast, hedge funds are in the habit of making their own risk decisions, undistracted by regulations and the false security provided by credit ratings. As a result, the hedge fund sector as a whole survived the subprime crisis extraordinarily well. By and large, it avoided buying toxic mortgage securities and often made money by shorting them.    As Mallaby shows, hedge funds are a diverse lot. Following the fall of Askin Capital Management in 1994, George Soros declared to a Congress hearing that \\"there is as little in common between my type of hedge funds and the hedge fund that was recently liquidated as between the hedgehog and the people who cut the hedges in the summer.\\" Nowadays hedge funds operate in merger arbitrage, long/short equity investing, credit arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, subprime assets, and all the other segments of market investment. And yet hedge funds have been equally vilified, mostly by people, institutions, and countries that stand at the other end of their investment strategies. Conversely, as Mallaby notes, \\"the countries that like hedge funds the best are also the ones that host them.\\" One may also conjecture that countries that use hedge funds for their sovereign wealth investments will also develop a liking for them, as did universities endowments and other institutional investors looking for higher returns.    I read this book after a series of popular essays on financial markets and the recent subprime crisis. I have no direct knowledge of the hedge fund or banking sector, and no practical experience of portfolio management. The names and faces of the people presented in the picture portfolio were all unfamiliar to me, with the possible exception of George Soros.

0143038419|5.0|It seems that every good book I read somehow becomes a part of me. I know that \\"Eat Prey Love\\" was deeper and more beautiful than I could have fathomed, personally it was enriching, educational and reassuring, not to mention a fun summer read that I'm happy to say I enjoyed tremendously. There are so many books out there and each has a different meaning and reaction, this is not only healing but also a nice reminder that when life is joyous and happy, it means I have succeeded and I need to stay on top of it making sure it continues and is nourished, not relaxing and letting it slip to lazy oblivion. The author tries her hardest to search for balance and happiness using her spirituality, soul and brain, and not her credit card or superficial items that only promise temporary feel good vibe with hidden penalties that make us feel worse not only later but also at our deeper inner most core which is more personal than we care to admit.    Elizabeth's autobiographical journey takes her through sensuous and rich foods and people of Italy, cleansing and enlightening fellow meditation believers in Indian ashrams and some extreme lush tropics and people who are very in tune with their existence and spirituality in Bali. Her trials and tribulations are so honestly written in this gem of a book that they made my head spin a few times, there is so much wisdom and warmth, friendly advice on how to be a happy person that I had a big smile as I read it. This lady knows her stuff, she worked hard to reach a place in our heads and souls that few people know they have access to and it's there if we look, we can also be taught by generous teachers like her, I know what Zen feels like and she is right, it's worth the fight and efforts, after all, things that we work hard for do taste the best!    The author is on a quest to quiet her mind and discover how far her imaginary hand can stretch, can she reach Xanadu or not? Westerners are always chasing after money, dates, better connections while feeling blue no matter what, she shows us how people who hardly have anything can give us a piece of mind and how that can enrich our lives. It's not often I read a book that gives back, and this certainly was a rich meal for my soul and mind, highly recommended.     - Kasia S.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I have been a long time admirer of British humor and the man that sits at the head of that table is John Cleese.  I became a fan of the slap-schtick, one-liner comedy that describes what came out of the British Isles back in the mid-60's as I was located 40 miles outside of London for 5 years.  Mr. Cleese brought together a gaggle of troupers and became an icon almost overnight.  His ability to put out a weekly comedy sitcom made life so much easier as we were looking for anything to take us away.  As the years went on and age overtook me, I found \\"Fawlty Towers\\" and was able to get a giggle again.  There is nothing out there today that can compare to this brand of comedy.  It will live on longer than the dvd set I possess.  If anyone wishes to forget about their life's troubles, I would strongly suggest to rent a room at the Fawlty Towers.  The service is lousy but the laughs are free-of-charge.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|I've been a fan of Loreena McKennitt since 1997 when I heard her song, \\"The Mummers' Dance,\\" coming over the radio as I lay there in bed one Saturday morning.  Later that day, I purchased her album, \\"The Book of Secrets,\\" which featured \\"The Mummers' Dance.\\"  Outstanding artist!  I enjoyed the other songs on that album as well to include, \\"The Highwayman.\\"  Ms McKennitt is truly gifted and her music ingenious.  As I listened, I could pick out a wide multitude of instruments being played and often wondered how many people does she have accompanying her.  This I would discover to a point when I saw her video for \\"The Mummers' Dance.\\"    Recently, I decided to do a YouTube search on Loreena McKennitt to see what videos were posted there.  There were quite a few live concert segments I found from her CD/DVD album, \\"Nights from the Alhambra.\\"  I was very intrigued and impressed, especially at seeing all of the musicians she had accompanying her on stage.  So, I decided to purchase this CD/DVD collection through Amazon.  Man, that was definitely the right purchase to make!    \\"Nights from the Alhambra\\" is simply outstanding and so amazing!  Ms McKennitt's music is so beautiful, and her gift for playing the piano, accordion, and harp is so delightful and enchanting.  I never realized just how impressive a harp could be until Loreena puts her hands on one.  And, the gifted muscians she has on stage with her are all in a class of their own!  Brian Hughes can make anything closely resembling a guitar come to life.  Hugh Marsh is simply magical in his improvisation on the violin.  And, Caroline Lavelle is skill and beauty in motion as she draws her bow across the strings of her cello, her facial expressions depicting the love and intimacy she puts into her music.  I could go on with regards to the other musicians, but we'd be here all day.    The other beauty of the DVD is watching the interaction of the musicians as they play off one another or in support of the other.  You can see all of them watch each other so as to adjust their play in order to compliment and not dominate whoever is being featured during a piece.  You can also see the appreciation these professionals have for their fellow artists' skills and talent.  It's musical teamwork that's well-orchastrated and in motion.  It is such fun to watch.  And, making this DVD such a delight to watch is the outstanding skill of the cameramen as they capture the perfect angles and closeups of the musicians so as to put you right in the middle of the ensemble.    Simply put, \\"Nights from the Alhambra\\" is brilliant and most entertaining.  If you enjoy the music of Loreena McKennitt, or appreciate a fine collection of musicians putting their heart and soul into their art while having fun at the same time, then \\"Nights from the Alhambra\\" is something worth checking out.
B0037RDPEG|4.0|This book drew me in immediately.  Elizabeth Gilbert has a way of writing as if she's directly talking with each of us personally.  I found myself laughing at many points throughout the book.    Gilbert openly shares her happiness and her sorrows on her journey for peace.  This book is about her personal journey to seek happiness after suffering through bouts of depression and a nasty divorce.  I love the open way in which she shares so much about her experiences along the way.  I didn't expect to learn anything from this book but I walked away with new knowledge, especially about meditation and yoga.   I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to travel to three very different parts of the world and loves happy endings.

B002JCSWVG|5.0|It's 1995 and Nelson Mandela (Freeman) has just been elected the first democratically elected black president of South Africa.  Not surprisingly, his supporters see this as the ultimate opportunity for pay back to the white community for all the years of oppression.  But Mandela is a different kind of leader.  He believes in working hard to unite all the people and forgiving those who have harmed him and his people. Everyone assumes Mandela will replace the white leadership of the struggling national rugby team with his own.  However, Mandela sees this as an opportunity to unify the country through sports.  He commits himself to working with the existing white leadership and particularly the captain of the rugby team played by Matt Damon. He challenges Damon to rise to the occasion and capture the World Cup which they are hosting. He is taking a great risk with the future of his leadership.  Based on the true story of Nelson Mandela and South Africa, it is part history, part leadership lesson and a moving sports drama.  Highly recommend.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Excellent!!!  You can't help but realize the truth after seeing all the evidence in this film.  Michael Moore is a  genius!!!  A lot of people are unconsciously brainwashed these days, and need to see this!!!
B00005RHGK|4.0|I thought this was a movie about silent off-road vehicles.  I was not prepared to be frightened. :) Upon realizing that I had purchased a horror flick, I was forced to re-evaluate my stress-level to the point that I focused upon his Crow-friends and the knowledge that this creature only appears every 30 years.  I was hoping this wasn't a documentary because it is very well put together and does keep the viewer's attention from beginning to finality.  But the truth is, though I did watch \\"jeepers Creepers\\" and found it a good movie, I purchased it for my niece's birthday gift because that was what she wanted most and we do aim to please.
1563894696|5.0|As a super critical Batman fan, I look for suspense, mystery, adventure, violence, revenge, and every other dark quality possible in a Batman story. The Long Halloween has it all, and is my second favorite Batman title after Frank Miller's Year One. Jeph Loeb did a great job crafting this story in the spirit of Miller's Year One, and the villains Batman has to face, in addition to the gangs of Gotham, add up to a solid crime fighting comic book. The ending comes out of nowhere, so do not read ahead, as tempted as you may be.
030726999X|5.0|Great book!  A strong finish to the Millenium trilogy.  We get more answers about Lizbeth's past and why she is the way she is.  One of the most intriguing characters in fiction to come along in a LONG time has engrossed us once again in her enigma of a personality.  The case is settled in fine style and she can now go back to her life.  Unfortunately we may never be able to read more about that life as Stieg Larsson is dead.  There is a rumor of a partial 4th book left on his computer, but that will no doubt languish in the legal battle that is being waged over his estate for years to come, if it ever sees the light of day.  So we may have to be satisfied with these three books.  Which does make me pretty happy.  This book gives good closure to the story and leaves us much more satisfied with the picture we have of this character.<br /><br />Goodbye, Lizbeth Salandar, you have served us well!!  May you remain out of the spotlight from now on.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|The Truman show special collectors edition is wonderful. The behind the scene look at how the movie was made was eye opening. The movie it's self is heart warming, funny at times. The ending was great. I believe you will enjoy this movie.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|I really fell behind on LOST. Once you crack it open though it pulls you right back in. I watched the whole 5th season in 2 or 3 days. I've never watched the show on TV, always buying the seasons on DVD. This is a show that never looses its momentum, I have to say I've never been bored with even one episode throughout seasons 1-5. I eagerly await for season 6 to ship, so that I can see the end!
B001SS3JS8|1.0|I agree with \\"Lily\\" in when she says\\" I definitely disagree with some of the reviews about the book being breathtaking and \\"not able to put down.\\"\\".<br /><br />It dragged on a lot to me, and the jumping from past to present was a pain to read through, especially with multiple(!) points of view. I also had trouble really getting into it, I found the story lacked real depth/detail, color, and texture. For example, Emily Golde's character is talked about a lot but we hardly know anything about her. Why care so much about someone you know nothing about?<br /><br />I also expected a twist, some kind of interesting explanation for why the tragic event occurred, but I got nothing that satisfied me. I would say more but I do not want to spoil it for those of you that will read it anyway.<br /><br />This is the first and last book of hers I will read. I need something I can really get into.<br /><br />I read 'Water For elephants' before this book, and that book makes this book look almost like child's play.
B001GCUO5W|3.0|The date is 1954. A patient is missing from an asylum (Ashcliff). Yet it seems impossible. So ex World War 11 soldier, now U.S. Martial is sent to investigate. What he finds or does not find on the island of secretive people will intrigues us as the story mores into much more than a simple investigation.<br /><br />If the Dr. Caligari story had not been done repeatedly so many times over the years, this film may have been surprising and more enjoyable. As with all hybrids, there were some tossed in dashes of \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" (1962), \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" (1956) and maybe the kitchen sink for good measure and voila. Does Marin Scorsese think no one goes to the movies? He cannot be that naive. At least the actors (well known) were really acting and not walking through the script. Leonardo DiCaprio is believable as Teddy Daniels. The music is also a character and does not overwhelm the dialog. A nice touch was any blood looked more like theatrical makeup so it did not overwhelm the story.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu-ray version so I cannot compare to others.<br /><br />I have to admit that I have not read the book yet.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000067IW0 Werner Krauss: Cabinet of Dr Caligari]]<br />[[ASIN:B000066AXE A Beautiful Mind (Full Screen Awards Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:0767821629 The Thirteenth Floor]]
B001E45XT4|5.0|Awesome headphones for simply listening to music or watching movies. Though, best of all, these puppies rock for gaming! Best gaming head gear i've ever owned by a LONG SHOT! The sound quality is wonderful with both the mic and the headphones themselves. They are also the most comfortable headphones i've ever put on too. They never make my ears hurt and the sound is always trapped in the ear covers. I'd honestly recommend these to any serious or casual gamer out there. I think the 377s are kind of a rip off, but these 367s give you the best bang for your buck. I also don't really know if it's possible to break these without intentionally trying to do so. Great great product!
0143036556|2.0|This book could have been written in about . . . 100 pages.  The author hammers on the same points continuously without offering any fresh takes due to the different circumstances he describes in the book.  Other than the history portions of the book which I found entertaining, I was thoroughly bored the entire way through.      Also . . . Montana??
B000O77SRC|5.0|Bruce Willis first big screen staring role was quite a jolt to fans considering its very different tone from his star making vehicle, the TV series \\"Moonlighting\\".<br /><br />In Moonlighting, Willis was perfect romantic comedy material, but his ability to perform deeds of heroism was very much in doubt.<br /><br />The cocky attitude came thru from the TV role, but added to it was a capacity to direct action and violence that was entirely lacking his previous performance.<br /><br />Often actors take a while to find the vehicle that best defines their movie career. Willis was lucky (or unlucky) to hit the mark on his very first try. Although he has branched into other types of roles in the decades since Die Hard, his subsequent roles are always measured against this one.<br /><br />The movie itself is an action delight. It was very unique when made, but spawned the myriad \\"heros who never give up and defy all pain and obstacles\\" movies that have been made since. It has been copied so many times and by so many major stars that the list is too long to even begin.<br /><br />Die Hard also gave us the most profane \\"best remembered line\\" in the history of movies. LOL
B001ED7C58|5.0|Many have stated that the love the soundtrack, hate the movie and feel the soundtrack is a sell out to some top indie bands.  Let me just state, while there may be truth to this, if it wasn't for the movie, and my purchase of the soundtrack, it would not have made my become aware of MUSE, and thus purchase all their CD's...I have become fond of their music because of \\"Twilight\\" and SUPERMASSIVE BLCAK HOLE.  Same hold true for \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack.  While I was aware of \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\", it was MEET ME ON THE EQUINOX that made me, again, go out and by their CD's.  So, soundtracks do serve a purpose...even if you hate the movie or the series.

0375703764|3.0|I went into Boarders looking for something horrify to read.  The guy at the bookstore sold me on \\"House of Leaves\\", saying \\"it made Stephen King look like bedtime stories for children.\\"  That got my attention.  I spent the following three/four weeks unraveling what Mark Z. Danielewski offers in House and though the book was by far the most complex and \\"different\\" fiction I have ever had the pleasure of reading, it was NOT scary.  I then got online and started to research House and found that it has an entire cult following... perhaps that is the intrigue.  Whatever it is, House provides the reader with an interesting story full of twists and complexities.  It is a challenging read and leaves the reader with more questions when finishing then there were when you started.  I don't know if I would recommend the read.  I do know that I don't regret reading it.  It was NO King, though.  If you want scary, try \\"Lizzie's Story\\" or \\"The Dark Half\\", if you want complicated and fascinating... read House of Leaves.    \\" (Untitled Fragment)    Little solace comes  to those who grieve  when thoughts keep drifting  as walls keep shifting  and this great blue world of ours  seems a house of leaves    moments before the wind.\\"
030745455X|5.0|I love fiction mysteries. Granted, I've only read a couple of these reviews, as I'm hooked on this series anyway and am off to read part 3.  Without listing characters, etc.  I found this sequel more interesting than the first because it revealed more about the Salander character, who is compelling, had a few cliff-hanging moments, and I couldn't put it down. It was also a bit cleaner than the first, but I'm not saying it's clean. :) The names/characters were a bit challenging to follow as some sounded the same or very similar.  This may have been intentional. I wish there was more Stieg Larsson.
B000E33W1W|5.0|Ghostbusters is one of the definitive comedies of the 80s, and probably the best effort put together by or for ex-SNL cast members. (some may argue that honor goes to the Blues Brothers, and those of you who argue that may be right).<br /><br />The movie is funny, smart, a little sexy, a little scary, and has great special effects for the time.<br /><br />There is no quibble with any performance in the film. Everyone is on target.<br /><br />Ghostbusters has one of my favorite lines from a comedy ... the non-sequitir \\"I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.\\" Brilliant. LOL<br /><br />Now that there's news of a Ghostbusters III with the stars of Ghostbusters now so much older, I only wonder one thing. Will they be playing the 'Busters, or the Ghosts?
0807014273|5.0|This book is an unforgettable piece of writing. It is written by Viktor Frankl, a concentration camp survivor, psychiatrist, and founder of logotherapy. In a clear, true, voice he quickly entrains the reader into the reality of the camps; the hierarchies, the realities, and the will to live that will allow humans to endure and participate in almost anything. Yet with the depravity he also writes of the few who shone- who cared for others; who did not abandon spiritual principles. This amazing first-person account is unforgettable because of his bravery, intellectual approach, and clear-headed ability to recount details. Dr. Frankl also shares the core principles behind his innovative approach to psychotherapy. We are all searching for meaning; reading this book will allow you to look at life in a new way and you will be changed forever. A life-changing and extraordinary book.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|I just purchased the 2005 widescreen DVD and was totally impressed with the quality. Other reviewers suggested it was not good. I have the original video on laser disc (4X3) and transferred it to DVD a number of years ago. Because it was 4X3 is why I wanted the newer 16X9 version. It blows my laser disc version away. It's not blue-ray, but the event  it is now 25 years old and neither you nor any of you friends will find this anything but equal or better than the best quality you would expect today for a standard current DVD. The quality is excellent.  The man is a genius and this shows his extraordinary talent in spades. I've spent more than 20 times the cost of this video to see him in person. While his concerts have been great and I will see him live again, I will watch this DVD again and again.
081297381X|5.0|If you thought that events such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and stock market crashes could be analyzed by traditional Gaussian methodologies, this book will turn you on your ear. The universe, Taleb declares, is Mandelbrotian, not Gaussian, as we will see later.  It is hard to pigeon-hole Taleb. If I said that he is a scholar, a statistician, a philosopher, an essayist, and a Jordanian-born New Yorker, that would come pretty close.   Taleb spends many pages explaining why conventional logic is just wrong.  The title of the book is an example. The title comes from the fact that in philosophy there once was an axiom that declared that \\"all swans are white.\\" This statement was meant to be an example of a universal truth, that is, until the discovery of Australia and the black swans that live there. The logic is that truth is not determined by what has been observed; it cannot ignore what has not been observed. Taleb refers to the latter part of this statement as \\"silent evidence.\\"    Taleb discusses both positive Black Swans and negative Black Swans (he always capitalizes Black Swans). Positive Black Swans are opportunities that present themselves unexpectedly, such as investment opportunities. Other examples of positive Black Swans cited by Taleb are the discovery of penicillin and Viagra. Taleb has disdain for financial planners (and a lot of other people) who claim credit for successful financial planning. Planning, he claims, assumes that you know the outcome, which you do not. Financial success, he claims, is just luck or at least just taking advantage of opportunities that unexpectedly arise.   However, he spends most of the book discussing negative Black Swans, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and stock market crashes, and how they are treated analytically. In risk analysis, these are sometimes referred to as the unknown unknowns. He has disdain once again, for the practitioners of Gaussian probability theory when applied to these typesof Black Swans. He also has disdain for Nobel laureates, especially those in economics who apply Gaussian methods. The universe, he declares, is Mandelbrotian, after the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot, who invented the Mandelbrot set and fractals. Mandelbrot asserts, and is supported by Taleb, that natural phenomena behave more like fractals than like Gaussian variables. Fractals increase (or decrease) in size according a scale factor.  What does this mean to you and me? It means that \\"outlying events\\" (as Taleb calls them) occur more frequently and with greater intensity than Gaussian analysis would indicate. Taleb claims that the stock market fall of 1987 would only occur once over a period greater than the age of the universe if we trusted Gaussian analysis.   So how do we handle Black Swans? Taleb does not have a prescriptive nor comprehensive answer to this question except to warn against ignoring them and to strive to mitigate them. The worst thing is to be blind to them, as we are wont to do. For mitigation methods, Taleb mentions both physical and functional redundancy, terms familiar to researchers and practitioners in resilience and resilience architecting.  He provides a list of \\"ten principles for a Black-Swan-robust society.\\" One of these is the maxim, \\"Compensate complexity with simplicity,\\" another way of phrasing the well-known Ockham's Razor, also emphasized in resilience analysis.    Apart from the analytical insights provided in this book, Taleb is also an excellent story-teller. He fills the book with entertaining anecdotes that illustrate his points.    Whether you are looking for an absorbing intellectual read or useful background material for the study of natural and human-made disasters and the resilience of systems to them, The Black Swan is an essential addition to your bookshelf.    The reviewer is the author of Architecting Resilient Systems, John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, NJ (2010)

B003ELOQD4|2.0|I was at this show in CA.  Good show and was really looking forward to this release since I was part of it.  Was I disappointed.    OMG the amount of shaking there is in this video is just amazing.  There is some massive jerking going on in this video.  The video is not smooth at all.  Very very poor quality considering this is the biggest band in the world right now.  My theory on this, well here goes:  As you know this show was broadcast live on YouTube and and I think they just used the same cameras for this release.  I was next to one of the cameras and believe they were not exactly the HD cameras you see ESPN crews using.      Anyways sound wise it is decent, but video quality wise it just appears that it is buffering all the time.

Turned out to be one of my favorite gifts.<br /><br />Our two teenage sons, who can never finish a movie with us anymore unless its at the theater and they're weighed down in their seats with popcorn, sat through the whole movie and enjoyed it.  Maybe not ok for real little kids, but okay for middle school and above.<br /><br />Remember its a short, so don't expect a long movie.  I liked the music so much I downloaded the soundtrack from Amazon the same night I watched the DVD!  (not going to wait for my wishlist on that one :) )
B000E6UK32|5.0|this is great CD+DVD I like everything.These are theirs early videos,  and price is good too.Picture and sound are very good. Thank you Amazon.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Wonderful CD together with an excellent DVD of the concert of two of the most outstanding musical talents of our times.
B0039TD826|4.0|'Exile on Main Street' was the last of several albums the Stones created in their most creative and meaningful period of '68 through '72. The music is heavily flavored with Blues, R n' B and Gospel - the very sounds they absorbed and re-interpreted so well. There is not a bad cut on this album - it rocks from beginning to end. I think it is under-rated by many and loved by those who like their rock hot and spicy!
B003A4IFGY|4.0|Wow, I am really enjoying listening to Mojo!  I recently bought tix to see Tom Petty in Phoenix and as a bonus they gave me this album to download.  1st of all, I am a guitar player and am pleasantly surprised by the great guitar playing and the recording sound overall.  From what I understand, this album was basically recorded live in the studio.  I bet most bands today could not record an album like that.  TP and the HB have no problem because they are a great live band.  The interplay and dynamics of the recording is fantastic.  You get 15 songs and most of them are great.  Some of my favs are, Running Mans Bible- which has a great hook and cool guitar fills, Pirates Cove, No Reason to Cry- notice how the 1st chord sounds like the Free Fallin' Chord..., Takin' my Time - cool guitar tone, Let Yourself Go - a toe tapper that reminds me a little of Baby Please Don't Go, Don't Pull me Over - has a little Reggae fell to it, and Good Enough - which definitely is good enough!  One of my pet peeves is fade outs at end of songs.  Since this is recorded basically live in the studio, I would rather have no fade outs so you could hear the live ending, BUT, they do give plenty of time at the end of the song for leads etc.  And not all songs fade out - Good enough is one...  This is an album I have listened to over and over and can't say that for a lot of the music out today. Get this cd and you will enjoy it like I have.  Keep on rockin' Tom Petty!!!
0525423842|4.0|Loved the story.  Seemed real.  Can also see this Grisham story in a movie.  It will be great for PG rating!  Liked how Grisham didn't rush to end the story like he has in several of the latest writes.  Thank you, John!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|great album, buy it! support quality music! Not much to say, but I wanted to support this album by purchasing it legally and giving it 5 stars.
B001QOGYFY|2.0|Bleh, then blah. Kinda knew this was going nowhere when the very first scene with the star has her go straight to her bedroom, slowly disrobe, and then take a long hot shower. Yes, some serious dramatic development going on here.<br /><br />Rarely have I cared less where a movie was headed. The central mystery is uninteresting, the actors barely decent, the script boring and flaccid, and the main thrills are how cold and windy it is, and shots of frozen corpses, over and over and over. Beckinsale is incredibly uninteresting; I never felt a thing for her character. Ditto everyone else. No character development, no reason to care about anyone. The manipulative, obvious score doesn't help, either. All in all, the only decent things here are the shots of the mountains and the aurora borealis.<br /><br />It's just a standard murder mystery with no impetus to care about anything. The professional production almost makes it even worse; if this was shot on the cheap it would probably have worked better. Whiteout is a glossy tv-movie, at best.<br /><br />I would recommend that you run, don't walk, to most any other movie.<br />There is absolutely no good reason to watch Whiteout....unless you need to get to sleep very quickly.
B003AO1SVS|3.0|Wow.  Big change in style for the Keys on this CD...this one is slow, moody, and somewhat dull compared to their previous discs.  The hard, gritty, distorted guitar-based sound that put them on the map is largely gone here.  I'm a huge Black Keys fan and Brothers disappointed me, but maybe more listenings will change my mind.  If you liked Dan Auerbach's solo recording you'll like this, it's similar.  Otherwise, pass.
081297381X|3.0|This book had a point to make, and it made it in the first 50 pages.  After that it was a never ending stream of \\"tid-bits\\" that made you feel as though the book would never end.  The message was a good one.  The presentation method was not so good.
B002ZG997M|3.0|Sorry, but this one just tries too hard to be hip and cool. From the overblown filter effects to the oh-so-epic shots of Denzel silhouetted against the sky, it's all overdone. The only real saving grace here is Oldman, enjoyably quirky as usual. But Kunis is ridiculous, barely an actress but real good at waltzing around post-apocalypse with her perfectly coiffed LA salon hairdo flowing in the breeze. Give me a break.<br /><br />Washington is solid as ever, no complaints there, but he really just doesn't have much to work with here in terms of script. The occasional sword and gunfight, a few long walks down the scorched road, a cannibal here and there, it's all good. Or not. And I hate movies that feature rape scenes or even threats of them, just to justify yet another revenge killing. So easy and so manipulative, and such lazy film making. The biblical overtones are barely explored, and poorly when they are. It's all a bunch of gobbledygook in the end and only Oldman made it worth watching for me after about 45 minutes.<br /><br />And what's up with the dynamic range on blu-rays and dvds lately? You can barely hear the dialogue and then suddenly BOOM BOOM BOOM!!! Huge gunshots or whatever crush your eardrums and you're grasping for the remote to save your brain when suddenly you can barely hear everyone talking again. I don't want to ride shotgun on the remote the whole movie. Use a limiter and do us a favor, or at least have a track with optional compression, because we're hearing too many guns and not enough words lately.<br /><br />All in all, not bad, but hardly fabulous, and when compared to its much worthier apocalyptic brethren, especially The Road Warrior (which has a perfect blu-ray transfer and looks better than this over-filtered sepia mess despite being made three decades earlier), Eli is merely a footnote.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This album is sincredible from beginning to end. Hot DAMN! literally. She's long gone and sinister kid are truly incredible and the rest of the album really is great.
B000O178BY|5.0|I can't really say what hasn't already been said... this is likely the best NIN album of all time, and a completely solid album when examined against the finer works of most other artists.    More mature, thoughtful commentary on political themes abound on this album, as opposed to the alienated, self-loathing themes of previous releases.  Trent is growing up fast now that he has kicked the bad touring habits and I almost feel somehow proud of what he has done with this album.    Oh, and let me not forget to mention the NOISE and lush textures... the auditory playground that a real industrial album should be composed of... soft and then hard, beauty and grit... yet very refined and unusually focused, it is just killer stuff!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I told my other half to \\"Listen to this!\\" and set my headphones on his head; that's how excited I was to hear Susan Boyle sing.  Fortunately for our union, he liked her too.    In this day of hyperbole on a minute by minute basis, it is wonderful to find someone about whom reviews are true.  This Voice is in the league of Judy Garland (Cry Me A River) and Barbara Streisand and Nora Jones.  Her rendition of Wild Horses was incredible; I Dreamed A Dream was perfectly inflected.  While I see where others are coming from in terms of the mix on this CD being uneven, the quality of Ms. Boyle's singing was beyond superlative and I cannot wait for more music from this artist.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|It's all about the characters! It's not about answering any of the questions that were teasingly introduced for 5 years. It's all about, you know, who winds up shagging who, just like every other vapid soap opera on tv. I mean come on people, do you REALLY care what the island was supposed to be in the end? Isn't the intellectual thrill ride that is the Jack/Kate/Sawyer/Juliet relationship roller coaster far better to have all the answers to? And I know I know, the flash sideways had nothing, absolutely nothing to do with anything that happened in the first 5 seasons of LOST, nor did they have anything to do with anything that happened on the island or to the characters while they were alive, but aren't you glad to finally, at the end of this 6 season saga, find out what they were really all about?    Season 6 is a classic example of the bait and switch, or of, wait for it... The Long Con! You know, the title of one of the earlier episodes! See!? They DID know where they were going with this show all along!    Sheesh.
B003FXXNH6|5.0|It's rare that a DTV movie can impress as completely as [[ASIN:B000K7UC2Y Undisputed II - Last Man Standing]] did. Aside from being the best film Isaac Florentine had directed, it was arguably the single best martial arts flick released that year. The fact that it was filmed for under $10 million and managed to attain cult status without a theatrical release makes it even more impressive. Florentine followed this masterpiece up with the questionable [[ASIN:B0011VIO46 The Shepherd: Border Patrol]] and [[ASIN:B002XTBE5Q Ninja]], both of which were a decisive step back from the quality he had pioneered for the low budget market. Thus, it was with some apprehension that I awaited the release of \\"Redemption,\\" fearing it wouldn't do the original justice...but I am happy to report that Florentine is back on par and delivers what is decisively the best straight karate flick of the year. Is it as good as its predecessor? Let's see...<br /><br />The story: after his defeat by George Chambers, former prison fighting champion Yuri Boyka (Scott Adkins) is left unable to fight with a debilitating knee injury, but his warrior's spirit doesn't die. Rehabilitating himself, he earns both the renewed esteem of the warden (Mark Ivanir, [[ASIN:B00012QM8G Schindler's List]]) and entry to an international prison tournament where the prize is freedom. However, when the conditions are manipulated to favor an unstoppable Colombian powerhouse (Marko Zaror, [[ASIN:B00127RAK8 Kiltro]]), he must accept an alliance from an American boxer (Mykel Jenkins, \\"The Bold and the Beautiful\\") if he hopes to taste freedom again.<br /><br />Boyka is back to fighting within 10 minutes of the movie. At first, I was disappointed that it seemed the entire rehabilitation angle was fudged, but in fact his injured knee remains a focus throughout the film. It never really heals, and you know that at any moment it could give way or an opponent could catch on and take advantage. It's a good plot point in the story of Boyka's redemption - redemption I don't believe he truly attains, considering his deeds of the last movie, but it's interesting to see him become more of a human being than he was the first time around. Of course, this is made easier for him by Marko Zaror's apt portrayal of his darker half. Like Boyka, Dolor the Colombian is religious, and even spends time reading the works of [[ASIN:0811216225 Federico Garcia Lorca]], but he's attained his physical greatness through drugs and his sadism knows fewer limits than even the old Boyka's. He makes a great villain, but the real bad guys are still the prison wardens, headed by veteran actor Vernon Dotcheff ([[ASIN:B0001Z37IG The Name of the Rose]]), who have dark plans for everybody but Dolor. It's an old ploy to arouse sympathy for unsympathetic characters (the fighters), but an effective one.<br /><br />Speaking of fighters, \\"Redemption\\" showcases plenty of excellent up-and-coming talent. In this field, it surpasses its prequel since that one only featured two real standout fighters - Adkins and Michael Jai White - while \\"Redemption\\" has four or five, depending on your standards. Adkins and Zaror are rightfully making names for themselves as solo stars but I was just as pleased by the casting of lesser-known athletes like Ilram Choi and Lateef Crowder. Mykel Jenkins isn't a martial artist but has a great build and convinces you of his proficiency in boxing. Fresh from a lackluster outing in [[ASIN:B0038M5VTC Hellbinders]], Esteban Cueto makes a decent brawler but only has a couple matches in the beginning of the film. There are plenty of better fights to see than his - fights so good that picking the best one is a real challenge, as almost all of the nine brawls seem to set a new standard for how fast I could jump out of my chair in amazement. Eventually, I give the nod to the much-anticipated showdown between Adkins and Crowder, the capoeira fighter who tore down the house with Tony Jaa in [[ASIN:B000I0RNWU The Protector]]: their unprecedented agility and flexibility is complimented by extremely satisfying back-and-forth choreography and long, uninterrupted camera shots. No quick cuts or excess editing, here. Florentine is to be commended for putting so much effort into his craft. The only thing I can find fault with here is the choice of soundtrack that plays in the background: the hip-hop is very unfitting.<br /><br />Production values are strong enough to have qualified for a theatrical release, with the exception of a few zoom-in closeups that are a trademark of Florentine's work. The acting content - always a gamble in the director's work - comes off as surprisingly strong. I was a bit disappointed that not a lot of authentic Russian is spoken, but the roles of the returning Scott Adkins and Mark Ivanir still feel legitimate. Mykel Jenkins' career should receive a boost following this film, for he proves himself a competent co-lead after ten years of supporting parts. In terms of realism, \\"Redemption\\" shies even further away from the realities of Russian prison life than \\"Undisputed II\\" did, but it's easier to forgive this time around.<br /><br />Is \\"Redemption\\" a great martial arts movie? - absolutely. Is it as great as \\"Last Man Standing\\"? Well, the production quality is certainly matched and the fight scenes prove that Florentine can always outdo himself, but some of the oomph from the prequel is lost on this one. Having Boyka as an antagonist helped make the first film so strong, and despite my previous praise, I don't think his shoes were 100% filled by Dolor and the wardens. Michael Jai White's presence is missed, but Mykel Jenkins provides an interesting alternate angle on the role of an American boxer in a European prison, if not the same level of hand-to-hand action, but Zaror, Crowder, and Choi marvelously accept this duty. Regardless of any perceived flaws, this movie will be hard to beat in the DTV market. You really don't need to bother with Van Damme, Seagal, or Lundgren if this movie is within reach.

B000ICLRJ8|5.0|Behind Enemy Lines is a good action movie. The story is about a flight navigator(Owen Wilson) looking more than a usual recon pilot mission. One day while flying over a certain war torn area, his plane gets shot down and suddenly life turns upside down while he tries to get back to his ship. You'll get to see Owen Wilson perform in not the usual romantic-comedy kind of roles and Gene Hackman is at his usual best as Owen's commanding officer - dealing with politics to get Owen out of his situation. Best to watch the movie to know more.<br />The video quality of the Blu ray is razor sharp with a 1080p transfer. Certain scenes such as the ship's cafeteria where the pilots have their meal is pretty detailed. When the scene shifts to enemy territory, overall look is cloudy and overcast, but that does not dampen the image quality. The Audio quality is something really different. Behind Enemy Lines bluray comes with an rocking DTS HD MA 5.1 soundtrack that will definitely put your surround system to test. Whether its the flying jet scenes or the explosive rigged sequences in war torn Bosnia, the audio never lets you down. All in all, an enjoyable experience.
B001FB563E|1.0|I am a huge post apocalyptic fan in all media types (Books, Movies, Games, etc).  This movie seemed to be right up my alley. Boy, was I wrong.  I learned in elementary school that stories should include: Introduction, Climax, and Resolution.  This movie has none of this.  All you know is they need to go down the road to the coast, but when they get there they do not even acknowledge what they expected to be there or their next course of action.  Soon after, the movie ends.  Soon after that, the story is forgotten.
B0032KNA4I|4.0|2012 is Roland Emmerich's version of another disaster movie but this time the end of the world is supposed to happen in Dec 2012 - hence the name of the movie. It's a well balanced kind of disaster movie in comparison to other works such as Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow, with John Cusack leading the star cast. But never has so much destruction shown on film than 2012 with outstanding special effects, buildings falling over, cars thrown over, etc. The ending seems to be a bit wary and could have been tweaked but its just a personal opinion but overall an enjoyable experience.  The video transfer is a top notch 1080p transfer(2.39:1) with exquisite detail shown most of the times. Especially in the disaster sequences, the viewer can clearly see the fine details of distant objects too.  2012 explodes onto blu ray with a wonderful DTS-HD MA lossless 5.1 soundtrack which does not fail to satisfy the ears. The disaster sequences will definitely test your surround speakers, be it the catastrophic sequences or the chirpy sounds of the birds in the quieter scenes. Dialogues also sound crisp and clear and there is usually never a dull moment to be heard. Go ahead and enjoy the blu ray.

B0034JKZ8G|5.0|As a fan of beauty & The Beast, and The Little Mermaid, I had high expectations for Disney's return to traditional animation. Suffice to say I was NOT disappointed. The Princess & The Frog is fun and magical from start to finish. Boy do I miss this style of animation. It creates a world  and look you simply do not get in this age of CGI movies that seem to be churned out like candy on an assembly line these days. If you're a fan of Disney's more traditional musical animated movies. See this now.
0143038419|5.0|When I glanced through the pages in the bookstore, I found something I could relate to immediately in almost every chapter of \\"Eat, Pray, and Love.\\" I bought the book, read it, enjoyed it, and have no regrets. It is what is is, a pleasurable, well written book.  Gilbert begins with a description of the origins of rosary beads, the japa malas..of which I also wrote about in my book, so I felt an immediate connection with the author.  I even have my own hand-made set of beads from seeds I acquired in Katmandu. I understood immediately her idea of breaking the stories up into 108 vignettes, little glimpses into hearts, minds, and memories of herself and of others. Thailand was my home for several years. I left just a few weeks before the tsunami she wrote about. Reading about that event was very mournful and nostalgic for me. I was hyper critical of how the author handled this, looking for ways I could fault her but honestly I feel she handled it very well.  Maybe when we have shared experiences, we also have a bond of understanding  between us. At least I feel connected with this author. I feel her writing style is readable and enjoyable, capturing the best essence of people and places she knew. Isn't that what good, pleasurable writing is all about?

B003KUSUG8|3.0|This album is quite a departure from \\"Relapse\\" and in my opinion, not a good one. What I get from listening to this album is that all of the songs are either Eminem boasting about his rap skills or centered around turbulent relationships. He seems angry on this album and I feel like he is yelling on a lot of the tracks and it just puts me on edge to listen to them. I don't feel anything really deep coming from these songs like I felt on Relapse and there aren't any songs with funny story lines. A lot of this is just him trying to showcase his rapping ability. It's almost as if he is trying to prove something to critics. Some of the lyrics are pretty lame and ruin an otherwise good song and some of the songs are just plain boring. I'm sorry, but I find this album very forgettable and it makes me love his previous albums all that much more.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|My 5-year old daughter caught a glimpse of this movie while I was watching it, and she fell in love with it.  She kept on asking me to play it on demand for her, day after day.  After that I bought it for her on a DVD and she still watches it a few times a week.  She loves the music and has memorized all the dialogue and songs in it.  The purchase transaction was great, hassle free, with a quick delivery.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|First let me say before reading this book I HATED running for runnings sake. But Christopher Mcdougall had me convinced about halfway through that running for running sake was something fundamental to our species. The evolutionary explanation and reality of tribes doing \\"endurance hunting\\" convinced me more than anything else.  Trying to run barefoot and learning what was wrong with my running form enabled me to run for the first time in years without any pain or shin splints.  This book was an important first step in that journey.<br /><br />Beyond that simple life enabling fact, the book itself is a terrific read.<br /><br />Highlights<br /> - Tarahumara Indians are just an incredible people to read about.  People who ran from Cortez hundreds of years ago able to maintain traditions over the years. Running is a central part of their culture with men in their 70's running 50+ miles and the daily games children play where they run 5-10 miles at a time.<br /> - Barefoot Ted, Scott Jurek and the wild wacky world of Ultramarathons. The races are intense and well told tales. Thinking running through Death Valley collapsing for 15 minutes and still getting up and winning the race.<br /> - The entire breakdown of why injuries have actually INCREASED since the \\"advances\\" in running shoes post-Nike in the 70's.<br /> - How humans have a considerable advantage over animals in just the ability to run for long distances and how we're actually built for it.<br /><br />To sum up, even if one isn't into running there is plenty to enjoy.
1590710037|2.0|I'll be honest: if I hadn't been listening to this as an audio book, and if it hadn't been a day when I was working as an extra, I wouldn't have finished this book. Not even close.<br /><br />There is some good, solid advice on craft and discipline in the first few chapters, but then Pressfield starts talking about golf and angels and God and other things which, belief aside, I'm not really interested in. I don't want to hear your kooky opinions or half-baked theories about the nature of the universe. And his implication that cancer is merely a symptom of people's unfulfilled dreams is offensive to anyone who's ever lost a family member to the disease.<br /><br />It's not nearly as bad as Dilbert creator Scott Adams going off the rails, but like I said, if I hadn't been stuck on set with few other entertainment options, I would have dropped it long before the end.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|One of the best seasons of television I've ever seen for any show. Bryan Cranston's character is all at once endearing, lovable, nerdly, tortured, and troubling as he tests whether 'the ends' really do 'justify the means'.<br />It's not for everyone and not family entertainment certainly, but I don't feel the writing is made to strictly entice (which admittedly it does) but to make you think and reflect on our own thoughts in actions in less than ideal situations.<br /><br />Unfortunately season 1 was cut off with the writers strike so it's only 6 episodes, still was enough to make me hungry for more.
1594488843|4.0|This made for an interesting companion book to Free, which I also read recently. Where Free looks at how businesses can make money off zero- or low-cost offerings, Drive investigates the other side of the coin: asking what motivates people to do things--often for free--which can be good for life as well as business.<br /><br />The oft-repeated theme of Drive is the gap between \\"what science knows and what business does.\\" And Pink puts his money where his mouth is--there are plenty of studies and research to back up his conclusions about \\"Motivation 3.0\\" and the things which can help any organization get the most out of its members; to wit, recognizing that people will work harder when they have autonomy and purpose, and in pursuit of mastery of a skill, than when they're just in it for the money.<br /><br />At its core, Drive advocates dismantling traditional management structures in favor of more \\"bottom-up\\" team building. Open source software projects and Wikipedia are cited, as they were in Free, and Pink also discusses several of my former employer's initiatives, like 20% time, peer rewards, and 360-degree performance reviews. (Not all of those were as successful as they could have been, but that's another post.)<br /><br />Read this book. If you're lacking in time or money, you can get many of the salient points from this excellent 11-minute video:<br /><br />[...]
B001GCUO5W|4.0|Scorcese excels in another wonderful character driven piece. Based on a novel, the story takes place in 1954. DiCaprio plays U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels, and he does so convincingly. Teddy is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Hospital for the criminally insane. As he starts to dig deeper and deeper into the case, he begins to wonder if somehow he is part of a much larger and twisted plot. Teddy quickly realizes that he must solve this case and get off the island before he loses his own \\"sanity\\".<br /><br />This movie really deserves 4.5 stars. Scorcese is such a master of building a \\"real\\" world in his fims. You feel like it's 1954 from wardrobe to attitude. The acting in this film is wonderful! DiCaprio's range is incredible, which makes him a great actor. We will be watching Leo for decades to come. I will not spoil the movie in my review (I never do), but like the box says \\"it deserves multiple viewings\\". That is because once the mystery is revealed, you will want to watch the movie from a different perspective. An excellent film!<br /><br />BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Paramount really does a nice job here. The colors are toned down to reflect not only the time, but the mood of the island and hospital. The pictures still remains crisp and every detail is captured to immerse you into the environment.

Because of his research, combined with his own experiences, it has become one of the classics to come out of WWII and of warfare. I did not read this book until watching The Pacific. His descriptions of all he experienced are so vivid I felt as though as was in the foxhole with him. I myself have experienced heat, rain, mud, fear, monotony, and relief. But every time I read accounts like this, I realize how lucky I really am not to have felt all of this to the degree and extremes as the WWII Marine did. Truly great Americans and warriors! Along with Mr. Sledge's personal experience is the great military history that is gleaned from following the campaigns from the \\"grunt's\\" perspective. Even better than Storm of Steel.

Every track on the album is refreshing and if you appreciate \\"real\\" music then I would definitely recommend the album.

0756405890|4.0|I'll say from the start, Patrick Rothfuss is not a bad writer.  His prose style is polished and fluid, and these days that is an absolute must for any book I read.  He's done a great job with his world-building as well; it feels detailed and fleshed out, and his sympathy magic system is innovative, heavily grounded in science, and isn't like anything I've seen before. Kvothe's poverty and his struggles and constant worries about money are realistic and well-done.  When he writes action, it's well-described, fast-paced and gripping...*when* he writes action.    That said, this book has problems.  Pacing is one of them; the sequence at the University goes on way too long and probably could have been cut by at least a third.  (And the ending of the book suggests that part isn't over yet and we'll see even *more* of it in the next one.)  But his biggest problem lies in his characters, in particular, Kvothe.  As I read further through the book, Kvothe began to irk me more and more.  He was just too good at too many things.  He could pick up extremely complicated branches of magic that normally took months of study in seven days.  He was the only one who knows anything about anything (thinking in particular of Denna eating the resin here).  Only he could fix whatever problems appeared, whether it was saving a girl from a burning fire, or fighting and killing a dragon (which he does single-handedly, with no help from the bumbling townsfolk).  Whenever troubles loomed--for example, threatened with punishment for breaking the rules--he was always able to slide out of them easily.  Everyone whom he needed to impress was bowled over by his charm or else intimidated by him.  As the book went on, I found myself rooting for him to fall flat on his face just once, and that's never a good thing.  (Also, not Kvothe, but Kvothe-related, Bast *really* p***ed me off in his final scene with Chronicler.)    A secondary problem (but possibly related to the first) lies in Rothfuss's femalecharacterization.  Although I'll read books with heroes of both genders, I do enjoy strong, well-developed female characters whenever I find them.  Unfortunately there really weren't any of those here.  Rothfuss's female characters are pretty much interchangeable.  They're all young or youngish, beautiful or at least attractive, friendly and playful when interacting with Kvothe, and bowled over by Kvothe's charm.  (Two out of four female characters also get to be \\"damsels in distress.\\"  Whee.)  Since the University admits female students, why not at least have one female master?  An elderly scholar-woman would have at least been a different character type.  Denna is delineated by the writer as this extremely special, unearthly woman, but she's largely a nonentity.  What makes Denna different from Fela, really, except that she comes and goes mysteriously and apparently she's extremely beautiful?  (It would have been more interesting if Denna had been a fairly average-looking young woman but Kvothe was so in love with her that *to him* she looked that beautiful.)  During the few moments when the plot picked up, Kvothe's romantic nattering with Denna started to get on my nerves.  You guys are tracking a dragon that might be a danger to the town; can we please stay task-oriented here?    Actually the more I think about it, the more it's not just his female characters that are flat.  Just about everyone who's not Kvothe comes across as a non-entity.  The masters are all pretty much interchangeable, except for the hostile one whose name I'm blanking on at the moment; same goes for the students, except for his avowed enemy Ambrose.  The one-dimensionality of the supporting characters enhances Kvothe's more grating characteristics.  Some have called Kvothe a Gary Stu, and while he's not an egregious example (think Rhapsody of the Rhapsody series), he does have Gary Stu-ish tendencies.  I would call him a borderline example, one which isn't helped by the narrative's tight focus on him and, again, the lackluster supporting cast.  I wonder if the real problem is that Patrick Rothfuss simply has not yet mastered the intricacies of characterization, particularly on a scale as large as the one on which he is attempting to work here.  He has definitely set himself an ambitious project, and his craftsmanship might not yet be quite up to the task of pulling it off.    I'm giving this book four stars on the strength of the prose style and the world building, which really is well-done; as I said earlier, the sympathy magic system was especially fascinating.  I'd never seen anything like it before and I was very impressed by it.  However, I probably will not continue on with this series.  Kvothe may be better developed in the later books; Denna may develop a personality; but I'm just not interested enough to stick around to find out.
B000ASAEQW|5.0|I sometimes think \\"The Magic Flute\\" is my favorite Mozart opera. But it is made up of such disparate elements that it's hard for any production to get everything right. Which is perhaps why I own seven recordings of the opera, three audio and four video.<br />This film from a 1983 Munich production would be my second choice for a video of the opera. The production is really quite lovely. The designs are beautiful, as are the eighteenth-century costumes. The old-fashioned stage elements like painted backdrops, moving set pieces, and trapdoors are used with charm and imagination. The cast is wonderful. Lucia Popp is pretty much a definitive Pamina, with her vocal and physical beauty and her wonderfully expressive singing. Edita Gruberova is a brilliant Queen of the Night, even if the top Fs aren't quite there on this particular evening (live performance, remember). Francisco Araiza is a lyrical and convincing Tamino. Wolfgang Brendel is a strong-voiced, genial Papageno, who keeps the comic shtick within bounds. Kurt Moll is a warm, imposing Sarastro, singing with a flawless legato line. The small parts are also well taken. Gudrun Sieber is a charming Papagena, Jan-Hendrik Rootering is an unusually powerful Speaker, the three ladies are a delight, and the three boys are wonderful. It's a bit surprising to see Monastatos and his henchmen in blackface, but this was before political correctness became universal; in any case, Norbert Orth provides a vivid character. The musical direction is in the capable hands of Wolfgang Sawallisch. I wish he'd taken more time with the slow numbers, but otherwise he turns in a well-paced, stylish performance. There is some messing-about with Act II. I can accept the logic of moving the farewell trio to the beginning of the act, but it seems strange musically to hear it there. I don't really miss the misogynistic duet for the two priests.<br />My favorite visual representation of the opera is Bergman's television film. No other director so fully realizes both the serious and fanciful sides of the work, and Bergman's visual images are unfailingly wonderful. Things are in good shape musically, though most of the singing is in the good-not-great class. I can live with Bergman's second act adjustments (omitting two numbers and reordering the finale), and I don't mind hearing the work in Swedish.<br />I have also watched the recently issued DVD of a 2005 Covent Garden production, which I find disappointing.

1416595546|5.0|Growing up in communist country, this family tragedy story is related to my own family accounts. To me, Stalin and his Bolshevik thugs from the East was just another version of Hitler and Nazi of the West.  One of the best books I have ever read!
B0000C5RQF|3.0|The best thing about this performance is the conducting of that great Mozartean Colin Davis. He brings to the performance a mature wisdom and a serene, effortless mastery of the score. The performance is perhaps even better than his audio recording of twenty years earlier. The cast is generally good. Dorothea Röschmann is a lovely Pamina. Diana Damrau is a spectacular Queen of the Night, singing with pinpoint accuracy. Will Hartmann is a rather beefy-sounding Tamino for my taste. Simon Keenlyside is a beautifully sung but rather joyless Papageno, but perhaps this is the director's fault. Franz-Josef Selig is a solid Sarastro. The British veterans Adrian Thompson (Monastatos) and Thomas Allen (Speaker) acquit themselves well. The three boys are less accomplished than their counterparts in the Sawallisch/Munich video. But then, there's the staging. In an interview on the disc, Davis sounds a bit equivocal about the production, though he allows that it lets the music speak. And so it does, especially in the serious parts of the opera. But on the whole, I don't like it much. It's an unconvincing mishmash of style and tone, with a motley collection of costumes. And it often looks downright ugly. For example: Röschmann is not the most svelte of singers, and her white gown shows an unflattering excess of flesh. There's no reason for the Queen and her Ladies to look like such grotesque hags; after all, they're trying to charm Tamino, not frighten him away. I emphatically dislike the Papagena - monumentally endowed, sleazy-looking, and totally charmless. Like most \\"concept\\" productions, I think this one tells us more about the director's psychological baggage than about the work being staged.  For a production that does justice to \\"The Magic Flute\\" in both musical and visual terms, go for the Bergman TV film or the Sawallisch/Munich production.
031606792X|1.0|Please note: this review has spoilers.  I should also note where I'm coming from:  a professor specializing in Victorian Gothic literature, I am familiar with the tradition of classic vampire fiction.  I am also a great lover of fantasy and, while not a twihard, had a more positive reaction to the first three books of this series.<br /><br />In terms of the series in general, indeed, I felt that Stephanie Meyer came up with a neat twist on the vampire genre.  The idea of a vampire falling in love with a human, and the vampire being moreover an inherently good soul who goes to great lengths to avoid violence (at least to humans) = nice idea.  And, if one accepts that this series is narrower in focus than, say, the Harry Potter series--being unlike Rowling's epic narrative focused on the Romeo and Juliet star-crossed lover theme--one can find Bella's love for Edward, and his for her, touching (that is, when he's not breaking into her room to watch her sleep!); Jacob's refreshingly feisty, irreverent perspective is fun as well, as well as the romantic tension of his rivalry with Edward.<br /><br />That said, my response to this book was much more negative than it had been to the previous installments. I wasn't thrilled with the grotesquely female Gothic portrayal of sex, pregnancy, and childbirth, nor did I much care for the preternaturally precocious and perfect genius child. And I was bewildered by the anti-climax of the final Confrontation That Wasn't (what was all that build-up for, anyway? The Volturi just hop a plane back to Italy?). But these were not my biggest problems.<br /><br />My biggest problem was Bella's becoming a vampire.  Now, you might wonder why I was surprised: after all, hadn't the previous books been leading up to this?  Well, yes and no.  Though Bella plans to become a vampire from the end of New Moon, there are some signs that this might not actually happen:  the Cullens' plans for evading the Volturi should she not do so, Rosalie's strong conviction that Bella would be making a mistake, Bella's own qualms about what it means to become a newborn monster.  I guess, too, that I was hoping against hope that, finally, Meyer would find a way of sparing her, of keeping her from making an irrevocable and, in my view, disastrous choice.<br /><br />It's ironic, really, how many of the reviews for this book, both pro and con, assume it has a happy ending.  For myself, I cannot see becoming a vampire as a happy ending, but rather a tragedy. What makes Bella distinctively herself is her humanity; that's what draws Edward to her in the first place.  Not only would HE prefer her to remain human, but in one of the earlier books he says that, whatever the sacrifice, he wishes he could become human instead of her \\"changing.\\"  Now of course I doubted that Meyer could bring about this denouement.  It would mean changing some of the basic rules that define the world she has created--but, honestly, didn't she already break those rules by having Bella become pregnant?  In any event, I so wish she could have found a way of making Edward human again. One 3-star review made a brilliant point about the problem with BD: there is no major sacrifice expected of the characters.  Precisely.  What would have it meant for Edward to sacrifice his immortality, his life with his family, if that was at all possible?  It would be a sacrifice that would allow Bella to remain Bella, the flat-footed, fallible, irritating--but still somehow endearing--HUMAN she is.  It would allow her to retain ties with her human family, instead of living on centuries beyond their demise--a fate I think of as torture rather than bliss.<br /><br />Of course, from my perspective becoming human really wouldn't be that much of a sacrifice for a vampire: it would be a definite improvement.  How can one envy creatures who not only never eat (I'm not counting blood-drinking) but never even sleep?  You call THAT a happy life?  I am sure there are many who think givingup sleeping and eating a small price to pay for eternal erotic bliss with Edward.  This is one of those cases, however, where it pays to be careful what you wish for. Think about how food defines our lives and social existence (what does it mean that the Cullens never use their shiny dining room table for sharing food together?).  And, though we humans may resent the amount of time we spend sleeping, think about what it means never ever to rest. Honestly, staying wide awake for all eternity--at least as long as the earth survives--sounds like a nightmare; it makes me exhausted just thinking about it, and that's not even factoring in the constant icky, if in Bella's case suppressed, urge to slurp human blood. Worst of all is the loss of humanity in its truest sense: vulnerable, broken, yet precious in that very imperfection and fragility.<br /><br />Emblematic of what was so very wrong with this book was the scene where Bella goes in her new supermodel vampire incarnation, complete with flashy car and cashmere dress, to pay megabucks for forged passports for Jacob and Renesmee, and the forgers drool over her startling beauty.  Supposedly, the ugly duckling has hatched as a beautiful swan (pun intended), but the scene seems so crass, so antithetical to the theme of spiritual beauty that supposedly guides Edward's love for Bella when she is human. Is this why we're attracted to vampires--that they satisfy our culture's obsession with superficial beauty and eternal youth, not to mention in this case fabulous wealth as well?  (Think of Alice spending most of her eternal 24/7 feverishly buying designer clothes.)<br /><br />Indeed, given the wealthy glitz and the new milieu she's acquired by the end of the series, I had this horrible sense that Bella had married into the mob.  Now I know that the Cullens, especially Carlisle (my personal favorite character), are the good guys of the vampire world.  Still, when all the other vampires come to help confront the Volturi (the Italian branch who are, when you think of it, a kind of parody of mafia bosses), we are reminded that most vampires are nothing more or less than murderers.  Bella tries not to think too hard about her house guests \\"hunting\\" while they're staying with the Cullens, but if you DO think about it, it means that our heroine's new life includes, among other things, hanging out with a bunch of serial killers.<br /><br />In conclusion, let me say that I do appreciate the pressure on a young writer to finish a series that has attracted such attention and such a huge fandom.  Obviously, not everyone can be satisfied, but I think it is a reflection of how relatively young and inexperienced Meyer is as a writer that she was not, in my opinion, able to do justice to the most promising aspects of her original conception.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Every so often a movie comes along that is well-deserving of all of the hype that is allocated to it.  This is one such movie.  In short, it ranks as one of the greatest sports movies ever made - not the least of which due to the fact that it is based on the true story of Michael Oher.<br /><br />One of the more notable aspects of this film is just how little of it takes place on the football field.  This is a movie about Michael Oher the person more than it is Micheal Oher the football player.  In spite of being about 6'8 & > 300lbs, we find Oher to be someone who is as uniquely human as the rest of us.  People who automatically believe that sports movies = zero plot will be quite surprised after giving this one a viewing.<br /><br />Likewise, very little focus is on Oher's HS football team.  It shows them winning from time to time & it shows Michael holding the league championship trophy.  However, the other players on the team only have bit parts and we know very little about them.<br /><br />Rather than being about a team's quest for a championship, this is a movie about a young man's involvement in the college football recruiting process.  It is also centered around his desires to escape his past and make the grade while fending off racism at a ritzy all-white private school.<br /><br />At its core, however, this is a story that shows how a little bit of kindness can go a long way towards making the world a better place.  Even in the sadistic, twisted time in which we live, it's good to know that magnanimity has not entirely gone out of style.<br /><br />Acting wise, this is one of the most well-done films I've ever seen.  There was not a single weak performance in the movie, and there are not too many movies I can say that about.  The casting office came through with flying colors!  Sandra Bullock's Oscar was well deserved, and Quinton Aaron is perfect as the gentle giant with puppy dog eyes.  Cameos by college coaches such as Nick Saban, Lou Holtz & Phil Fulmer were a nice touch.<br /><br />Whether you love Sandra Bullock or merely adore Sandra Bullock, this is a heartwarming movie that will stay with you forever.  If, after watching this movie you're not stirred in the least, I would highly recommend that you check your pulse to ensure that you still have one!you love Sandra Bullock or merely adore Sandra Bullock, this is a heartwarming movie that will stay with you forever.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Visually, this movie is a feast for the eyes, but many are not seeing or are refusing to see the most important thing about it: the message. To those who say this story has been told many times before, you are right. Why? Because we have been doing to each other what the humans did to the Na'vi since the beginning. It is the central theme of the story of humanity: man's inhumanity to man. Human beings can be wonderful as individuals, but as a whole we are a disaster. Avatar is a scathing indictment of our species that is dead on accurate. There is no fix for us. We need to evolve, to create our replacements and step aside.
B00006ADFL|1.0|I cannot understand why there are only five-star reviews for this film, I just finished watching it and I was not only bored to death but also horrified by the weak story, weak performances and over-all lack of anything creative or inspiring. It started out good though, the first scene into the story is that of the two main characters, covered in blood and screaming. This screaming would continue throughout the rest of the story, as it seems the two girls don't know how to do anything else. Pauline looks like a stubborn and self-pitifull child whenever she's around adults and the actress portraying her could only find one way to express Pauline's feelings, by contantly moping around and making over-acted comical faces. Seriously, after half an hour I was sick of the constant screaming giggles I could only perceive. Kate Winslet's performance was slightly better, she kept a certain degree of dignity into her playing. Another thing that puzzled me is why Pauline had to go have sex with this guy who was supposedly in love with her, while she'd been praising her feelings for Juliet and was so heartbroken when she had to go to the hospital. Overall; bad and terribly over-acted performances, weak dialogues (even the imaginary scenes are unimaginative as hell, add to that that the visual effects are really bad as well) and just completely uninteresting story-line. The ending was better though, except that it didn't seem to match the story-line at all, it could have been a good ending to another film.

B003HLM2QO|4.0|I absolutely love Ozzy, I've listened to him as long as I can remember. This album has some great sounding tracks like \\"Scream\\",Life Won't Wait,and \\"I want it More\\". Didn't like \\"Crucify\\". Ozzy may be getting older, but he definitely still got what it takes. I really really enjoyed Black Rain, was kind of hoping this would've been more like it.    However, having said that. this album should have been marketed differently. If you buy the hard copy here or in the store, you miss out on some great tracks. Itunes (which I don't like) had a exclusive pre-order only (which I think is unfair) track called \\"One More Time\\",its my favorite track from this album and should have been expanded on the hardcopy. Also missing from this album is \\"Jump the Moon\\", which appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese release. Hopefully there will be some release version later that has these tracks added in.     Also, Ozzy you've still got a great voice and I sure hope theres more to come. Just one more critism, watch the \\"overmixing or dubbing or whatever its called. It doesn't sound good and with your voice still as strong as ever you don't need it.

B002G1K82Q|5.0|Much like Beyond the Mind's Eye, the visuals are the reason to watch. I listened to U2's music as I watched actually. The 60s connection was what the filmmakers were aiming at but it really was futuristic. The CGI was seamless. A sequence of dreams. The future of the past. After seeing on DVD, the Blu-Ray version is even more stunning visually.     So many movies have such lousy dialogue, nice to see one that had little or none. Actually, on Blu-Ray, I watched it backwards and enjoyed it more. In fact, it would have been a better experience for viewers if it would have been shown backwards not forwards just to see what a few people could imagine come to life and where they came from.    Turn off the sound, listen to other music, even Enya and Yanni, and relax and ride the visuals. Definitely watch it backwards (sound off).    Without the stunning visuals, the movie would have been an exercise in extreme boredom. Relax and let it envelope your conscious self. It is an escape from reality that rarely happens.

0307454541|5.0|I picked up this book (and the two sequels) because I believed I could benefit from exposure to the writing, and was convinced by the publicity that it would hold my interest.  I was correct on both counts for all three books in the series.  The writing is terse, not one extra word.  Out of all three books, I could find possibly only five sentences that were a bit tongue in cheek.  They were predictable, and so,to me, seemed like overwriting.  A comparison might be helpful for anyone who has read the Harry Potter series.  While everyone can identify with at least one of the three major characters in Rawlings books, I doubt many can identify with either of the two major characters in Larsson's.  On the other hand, Salander is fascinating.  She is even more of an underdog than Harry Potter, and while Harry is blessed by the curse that was thrown at him by you know who (instead of losing his life, Harry's life is enhanced by gaining some of Voldemort's powers), Salander's powers are also her weaknesses, and, she is a victim of unbelievable proportions.  I often found myself like many characters in the books when contemplating Salander's survival abilities; dumbfounded, and cheering like mad.  A page turner?  You need a whole new description for these books.  About halfway through the first in the series (The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo), without realizing it, I began increasing the speed of my reading.  By the time I reached the middle of the second (The Girl Who Played with Fire), I was racing so fast through the words that I would lose my breath every three pages.  I'd actually have to stop reading, put the book in my lap, and rest.  But I would dive back in as soon as I could.  This feverish, out of control speed reading continued without abatement until, with a final gasp, I put down the third book for the last time(The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest).

The fact that this did not happen is South Africa is a tribute to one of the most amazing leaders in the history of the world. This movie explains how the South African miracle happened.     I have been to Mandella's cell on Robbin Island, and all I can say is that this Mandella is more saintly than any character in the Bible. Clint Eastwood does a terrific job of revealing the saintliness and political skill of the man who united a country that was doomed to blood shed, division, and turmoil.

But I had heard so many good things about the Eleventh Doctor, I wanted to give him a try.  Then I found out that Stephen Moffat, creator/writer of one of my favorite comedies \\"Coupling\\" was taking over the series and I knew I had to watch it.<br /><br />So far, I have not been disappointed, the first two episodes are full of adventure, quick British wit, and characters that keep me coming back for more on a regular basis.
B002VZC9CY|5.0|I'm in love with Natalie Merchant's new album \\"Leave Your Sleep.\\" She has taken literary pieces of poetry and put them to music. The result is nothing short of incredible. The 26 song, 2 disc album comes with a book of the songs/poems. The songs themselves range in musical contributions from various artists and an eclectic mix of world music. The combination is nothing short of perfection.     I would not do this album justice if I didn't include Natalie Merchant's own introduction to the album, found on the first page of the book included with the album:     \\"This collection of songs represents parts of a long conversation I've had with my daughter during the first six years of her life. It documents our word-of-mouth tradition in the poems, stories and songs that I found to delight and teach her. I pulled these obscure and eccentric poems off their flat, yellowed pages and brought them to life for her. I willed into being this parade of witches and fearless girls, blind men and elephants, giants and sailors and gypsies, floating churches, dancing bears, circus ponies, a Chinese princess and a janitor's boy and so many others. I tried to show her that speech could be the most delightful toy in her possession and that her mother tongue is rich with musical rhythms and rhymes. I gave her parables with lessons in human nature and bits of nonsense to challenge the natural beauty of things and sharpen her wit. These poems speak of so many things: longing and sadness, joy and beauty, hope and disillusionment. Grave or absurd, these are the things that make a childhood, that time when we wake up to the great wonders and small terrors of this beautiful-horrible world of ours.   In spite of the fact that I have written song lyrics for thirty years, I'd never considered myself a poet or gave much of my time to reading poetry. I'm a late convert to the art form but now I understand that poets are our soft-spoken clairvoyants. They tell us about the things that have made us and keep us human. Poets are keepers of the sacred language that describes our holy places-unknown and unknowable. The poet holds the mirror that reflects the true shape and touch and taste and sound of all the things that bind us together and keep us apart. The poet's work is putting silence around everything worth remembering. Poetry on the page can be difficult to penetrate; sometimes it needs to be heard. I used music to enter these poems, and once inside I was able to understand how they were constructed with layers of feeling and meaning.   Five years of research and writing went into \\"Leave Your Sleep.\\" It is the most ambitious project I have ever attempted or even dared to conceive. I wrote over fifty of these poem-songs until the process consumed me. Over time my curiosity about the lives of the poets included in my anthology grew. So I read biographical accounts and letters, searched archives, and contacted heirs, executors, or the poets themselves in an attempt to know more about co-writers. Although it's impossible to sum up a life in 500 words or less and a single portrait, some of what I learned and found is included in this package.\\"
B003KUSUG8|5.0|After 2009's Relapse, I was like, wtf is going on with this album? Maybe I've just outgrown Eminem??? I use to play Eminem albums from start to finish, til I knew every word to every song. Not sure what happened on Relapse(the accent maybe?). Maybe the hooks weren't catchy enough for me(\\"Be careful what you wish for\\" was the only track I listened to repeatedly). So I'm thinking, okay, Eminem is played out now...lol...btw Drake's Thank Me Later is classic. I was nervous about purchasing this album, but oh boy was I suprised.    \\"Recovery\\" is the perfect title. Shady definitely regained his footing with this one. The production of every track is solid and Eminem's lyrics are beastly as expected. It's hard to pick favorite tracks b/c I love all of em. Favorite tracks (Love The Way You Lie ft. Rhianna, 25 to Life, No Love ft. Lil Wayne, Seduction, Not Afraid, Changes, Talkin' To Myself, You're Never Over) Eminem is back. Well worth the 10 bucks. Thank Me Later and Recovery should hold me over for the year.

Do not watch this in 3D, 2D is just fine...though I thought the movie was terrible, but if you like exact book remakes and cheap ways to put a big screen name like Jim Carrey in a moive ~ then fine...but the movie in whole deserved a live sets/locations.    So....with that said...I cannot imagine this 3D blu~Ray being any better.

B003EYVXSW|3.0|I hope there is a director's cut of Splice.  I really, really, REALLY hope with the DVD it will be like 2007's I Am Legend and have on a bonus disc the film's original ending.  Why do I say this?  Well, I haven't researched much, but Warner Brothers once again - just as in I Am Legend - has a decent sci-fi movie that ends on a low-note.  I'll put it this way: up until the final 15 minutes I thought Splice was one of the best science-fiction films I'd ever seen.<br /><br />Just about everything in Splice works up until it reaches a generic, action climax.  Great acting from the cast and a sympathetic creature make the film a compelling sci-fi drama.  One of the best I've ever seen.  An easy 5/5 movie....until suddenly some executive seems to have decided the film needed to transform into a horror creature-feature in the last fifteen minutes.  It becomes so generic and predictable in these last 15 minutes and....terrible.  I can't see any explanation for this other than Warner Brothers repeating I Am Legend.<br /><br />Dren (the creature) was NOT a monster.  She was a fascinating individual creature that I could feel sympathy for.  The way Clive (Adrien Brody) and Elsa (Sarah Polley) interact with Dren is very powerful.  You can tell that the characters come to love Dren and that Dren cares about them, making for a tragic, yet powerful ending to the film...until the before mentioned last 15 minutes appears which almost completely ruins this drama.<br /><br />Now, seeing as the film will be released on DVD/Blu-Ray I'm hoping to see an addition with \\"Controversial Original Ending!\\"  (by controversial they of course mean the GOOD ENDING).  I will re-evaluate the film at such a time as an alternate cut is released.  I refuse to believe that Guillermo del Toro, the writer of Pan's Labyrinth (who is the executive producer of Splice and someone who praised the script) could have supported a script that shoots itself in the foot in the ways that Splice manages to in its final 15 minutes.<br /><br />When Splice is released on DVD/Blu-Ray please, please, PLEASE hold out for a cut with the \\"original ending\\".  It may save you some money to buy a single-disc theatrical cut but please do NOT support WB's altering movies to make them \\"more marketable\\".  Splice is a great sci-fi movie that is destroyed by a lackluster ending that is entirely inappropriate given the dramatic nature of the rest of the film.  Tell Warner Brothers, and other companies that we want movies to have the endings that work FOR that particular movie.  Splice was NOT intended to be a horror movie and as such WB/producers shouldn't have attempted to transform it into one with 15 minutes of sub-par creature-feature footage that destroys the poignant beauty of the rest of the film.n Splice is released on DVD/Blu-Ray please, please, PLEASE hold out for a cut with the \\"original ending\\".

B003DRWX9I|4.0|Bought the mp3 download; should have sprung for the Cd!  I did that because with all the collaborators, I thought there may be a few clunkers in the bunch, so the lower price   wouldn't sting if there were.  But I shouldn't have worried.  The formost cool thing about  this, is Slash's collaborators on this album--many of them are good friends of his.  What does THAT say about the guy?  And secondly, how many prima donna guitarists would make an album, play guitar on it, and play the song in the  usual musical style of the guest vocalist?  The majority of albums made by solo lead guitarists--IMO--are   ego wanking afairs and don't really do much for me.  Not this one...  And the more I listen  to it, the more it grows on me.  I wouldn't say there are any legendary solos on it--like  on GNR's output--but there are some bright moments.  The outro for \\"Beautiful Dangerous\\" really  sticks in my head, great groove.  I just wish those extra tracks available for download at  amazon.co.uk were available here, but alas, \\"geographical restrictions\\" whatever that means.  I also recommend the excellent article in \\"Classic Rock\\" magazine (April '10) if you can still snag  a copy, where Slash talks about how it all came together.  It's good to know some people in rock  still have integrity and you can hear it in this album.  Oh, and it ROCKS!!!!
B003HTPHSQ|2.0|Oh, Cyndi Lauper. Crazy, wacky, eccentric Cyndi. Why? Why are you taking a page out of the Rod Stewart handbook of \\"how to run your career and status into the ground\\"? I mean, her last release, 2008's [[ASIN:B001725ZB4 Bring Ya to the Brink (Snys)]] wasn't exactly the stuff of pop legend but it was good because it was all original material and it had attitude, sass, music that made you want to dance and made you want to think. In other words, it was all very \\"Cyndi Lauper\\" and a much welcome album considering she's been hung up on either revisiting past hits and re-inventing them (2005's [[ASIN:B000CDSS2M Body Acoustic]]) or ditching the pop act for something classy and prestigious with an album of cover material of some old standards (2003's [[ASIN:B0000DG06E At Last]]). Now we have a new album that sounds pretty darn familiar and old ... because it's yet another album of old standards being covered! Yes, Cyndi Lauper makes her return to music with `Memphis Blues', an album full of blues covers. Sigh.<br /><br />At first listen, I have to admit I was really excited. There's one thing you have to appreciate about Cyndi Lauper - from `She's So Unusual' down to her most recent release, it's clear that whenever something musically strikes her fancy, she's on it. I give kudos to Lauper for ditching the usual dance/club sound of `Bring Ya to the Brink' and the remix album(s) that followed it and taking on the blues. It's a very ballsy move, something only Cyndi Lauper seems capable of doing. The blues is, as many of you know, a genre of music not usually associated with 50-something year-old white women best known for singing about girls wanting to have fun or she-bopping. I'm all for Cyndi Lauper singing blues songs: if they are her own. My issue with `Memphis Blues' is that it doesn't at all feel like Cyndi at her best. It feels like someone shoved a few popular blues songs in front of her and she's performing it. The key to any blues song is being able to relate to the music, to sing each lyric with a bit of angst and pain, to make the listener believe that each word and experience you're singing about is something you've experienced and suffered from. I didn't get that feeling from any of Cyndi's songs on this release.<br /><br />The Good: On \\"Don't Cry No More\\" and \\"Rollin' & Tumblin'\\" she sounds as if she puts more of her own personality into the music. This is perhaps that both of these songs aren't totally `traditional' blues and perhaps not being boxed in allowed her to feel more at ease in letting go and as a result have more fun with the songs. \\"Don't Cry No More\\" was a welcomed upbeat track, sounding more like a fun 1950s/60s song with the \\"blues\\" theme of dealing with a relationship on the edge of troubled territory. \\"Rollin' & Tumblin'\\" with Ann Peebles was another great song and with it being a duet, Cyndi really seemed to work off the energy and attitude Peebles brought to the table. Again, this is another upbeat track and since the album is heavy with slower, bluesy \\"life done me wrong\\" types of numbers, these two tracks definitely gave the album a much needed shot of fun and attitude. I had no issue with Cyndi's voice on this release. I felt that her voice and vocals actually were well-suited for the blues genre that isn't really about singing notes perfectly and is about having a folksy, everyman appeal to it.<br /><br />The Bad: The biggest disappointment that comes with `Memphis Blues' is the lack of original material. I feel this definitely held Cyndi back from her usual standards because these songs really aren't hers and she never fully dives into the tracks and music and makes them her own. I would have been more interested in hearing her take on blues songs that were all hers and belonged to no one else - songs with lyrics that she could relate to, that she's experienced, that she could make an emotional connection to. I didn't feel she made a real connection with many of the songs she was singing on thisalbum. Most of the time I got the `cover' vibe: she's performing them, even down to taking on different cutesy voices or imitating the original artists who performed the song before her. I also felt that at times having so many featured artists, many who had done the song before her, overpowered her own presence on the album.<br /><br />In all, I'm not thrilled with `Memphis Blues'. It feels a bit of a lazy release and again, like a page out of Rod Stewart's book: make money by singing other people's songs. I think I'd rather have had her turn her older hits, or even lesser known tracks, into blues songs than listen to her (yet again) be reduced to being a cover artist. Sure, she's been in the business for a while and has earned the right to do whatever the heck she wants to on an album or two but come on, `Memphis Blues' is not Cyndi Lauper and she's capable of so much more.<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"Rollin' & Tumblin'\\", \\"Don't Cry No More\\", \\"Just Your Fool\\"I got the `cover' vibe: she's performing them, even down to taking on different cutesy voices or imitating the original artists who performed the song before her.

0792163710|5.0|If you have never seen, nor heard of the movie Shane, you are in for a real treat. This is a classic western story that doesn't fade over time. I first saw this as a young boy. It was an inspiring tale of a stranger who befriends a family- who takes an immediate liking to him- even though they are not sure of who he really is. Brandon De Wilde is remarkable as the youngster who is at first intrigued by Shane (Alan Ladd) but soon comes to love him like his own dad. The story line is great in representing the conflict between the old west of cattle freely roaming the range and the new farmers putting down stakes, building homes and raising kids. With a great lineup of superb actors and the scariest bad guy (in Jack Palance,) all the elements for a great picture are there for the taking. I give this a top rating. At age 67, I love the movie as much now as I did as a youngster. Enjoy!!

B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm a 28 year old male, so probably not the typical person purchasing this video, but thought I'd post anyway.  First off, I'm not overweight, but for the past couple years, I've been developing a bit of a belly.  I despise cardio, so it's proven difficult to get rid of.  I thought that since this video was only about 20 minutes long (plus some extra for warm up / cool down), I could handle it.  This is my first work out video ever!    I've done this video for the past 3 weeks, but honestly haven't been good about doing it every day.  I've probably done it about 10 times now.  However, I can already see results.  Unfortunately, I haven't taken any measurements, but I can tell you that my stomach is visibly starting to get smaller, and my legs and chest look slightly more toned.  It's not a huge difference yet, but it is noticeable.  So far, I've stuck to level 1, and it was definitely a challenge at first; I am still very sweaty and badly in need of a shower at the end of each workout.  I've noticed an improvement in my endurance and now, I can get through most of the video with just a few very short (5 second) breaks.  I'm going to continue this level for the next two days, and then move onto level 2.    Pros:  1. 20+ minutes a day is easy to fit into your day and is not that difficult to force myself to do.  2. The 3+2+1 system constantly switches things up, and keeps things interesting  3. Seeing visible results already, after only about 10 exercises, and missing a couple days  4. Endurance improves quickly  5. 20 minutes CAN be challenging, and you will work up a sweat!    Cons:  1. Not going to build much strength or size from this (although that's really not the purpose)  2. Jillian can be a little annoying.  \\"Pain is just fear leaving the body..\\"  C'mon...really?  3. The music could be better  4. If you watch it in a standard DVD player, you may or may not be able to skip the intro advertisement garbage.  This is fine for the first day, but I don't need to watch advertisements every time I watch the DVD.  However, I now just watch it in my computer, and skip right to the workout.    Overall, I'm satisfied with my results so far, and I'm very excited to see what will change after 30 days of doing this continuously!  For about $10, this video definitely can't be beat.  Will you be shredded in 30 days?  No.  But will you look better?  I'd say absolutely.

B0036EH3WU|2.0|Where do pressing questions go if they want to remain unanswered forever? They go LOST... :) - Mysteries have a tendency in LOST to seem be so important as to let the world depend on them (sometimes quite literally!), while in fact there's not really much there that deserves thinking it through. That's the sad truth after the curtain went down on this show after a mostly extremely bland final season. Even the iconic moments the show definitely featured during the first seasons to a great deal become meaningless on retrospect. Even main characters that were set up as key players in the grand scheme of things turn out to have no clue whatsoever eventually. So the authors choose not to reveal too much as they go along, just tease, keep things interesting and suspenseful with immense cliffhangers and what not, yet often let mysteries die due to old age after some seasons have passed.<br /><br />According to a website that collects all mysteries the show presented to us the series leaves us after the final episode with no less than over 60 major questions entirely unanswered and about 220 minor ones that aren't addressed properly either. The show turns out to be more like a puzzle construction kit where you can put together what you like and how you like it, but a deeper meaning is, well, seriously LOST. If you are lured into the intriguing web of enigmas and hope that there might be light at the end of the tunnel revealing what island, monster, the so-called others, the legendary numbers or that fabled guy Jacob are all about, you're in for major disappointments. The characters are basically running around in circles, dealing with and fighting against what they don't know. Which is especially difficult to watch in the final season, where the few things that are dealt with turn out to be a mess standing on shaky feet, and the ending feels tucked on. There are in fact only seasonal arcs, peppered with references to what is yet unknown at the point of a particular episode, but the arc that connects it all, even semi-constructively, is missing entirely.<br /><br />\\"It's all about the characters\\" the show runners explain their lack of interest to deal with answers and yet they threw in one twist after another in six years, thus building the \\"character\\" of the island. Only to leave that latter as shallow as you can possibly imagine. There are dozens of fan theories out there which prove to be way more creative than what the LOST writers managed to come up themselves - which isn't that difficult if you consider that the master plan was to just focus on one aspect of the show in the end, leaving everything else to everyone's own imagination.<br /><br />\\"Every question you ask will only lead to more questions\\" someone says in the final season implying to stop asking questions altogether. I recommend not to start with it, as in case you do you're likely to crash like flight 815 on trying to process the material. You can watch the show for light entertainment with no expectations, and you might enjoy it thoroughly from beginning to the end. However, LOST promised to be so much more given the grand themes that were set up in the first seasons.<br /><br />Thus: 2 out of 5 from me for the whole series, which ultimately didn't deliver. Especially the last season makes a good deal you've watched entirely pointless. Oh, maybe there's one message the show really conveys effectively: Get over it, move on!

B003AMAOW4|5.0|This new Decca release of Lohengrin has already initiated controversy and discussion at the Opera L site. What is not controversial, however, is the praise and enthusiasm for the performance musically. As much as I enjoyed Klaus Florian Vogt's Lohengrin on Opus Arte, Waltraute Meier';s Ortrud and Kringelborns' Elsa (until pressed to produce spinto tones which are not hers to give) I would have to award this set as the \\"best\\" Lohengrin on DVD. The reasons are not hard to find. Jonas Kaufmann is an artist without peer; not only is he musically intelligent, has artistic impulses that I have rarely enjoyed in the tenor voice. The fact that is handsome and is a superb actor are pluses which will make this artist a \\"go to\\" man for many roles. He has the ability to cross vocal lines from Don Jose, and Werther, the Berlioz Faust and Cavarodossi, and Florestan. On YouTube there is a clip from Swiss TV of the Student Prince; the music may be kitsch but Kaufmann elevates it by treating it as worthy of the effort he would put into an operatic role and there is no trace of an accent. In the Decca Carmen he was clearly comfortable with the dialogue. And wonder of wonders he is a tenor who knows the value of singing softly. In fernam land is sung very softly, a hushed mezza voce, so nuanced that one almost things he is singing it for himself. Glorious.    His Elsa is equally gifted; she is able to bring to the party what Kringelborn and Armstrong couldn't: a lush spinto tone that is never stressed or shrill. The voice is a beautiful one and for those who have never heard it YouTube did have (or maybe still) clips of the Strauss' Four Last Songs. Her repertoire is equally as varied as Kaufmann's, from Mozart, to Verdi and Wagner. She is clearly comfortable with the produdtion as are the remainder of the participants. I have no doubt that if she wasn't in demand before this release, she will be now.    The remainder of the cast is excellent and the choral contributions maintain thesame high level that the soloits bring to the performance. Leading all the participants is Kent Nagano; this is his second Lohengrin on DVD; the earlier performance was equally as glorious as the Munich set. Thank God I don't have to choose one over the other since I already have the earlier set. Munich Opera has provided a number of performances that have been preserved on CD; I hope that his is merely the beginning of what could be a happy partnership between the company and DVD technology. The archives alone are mouth watering, e.g., Frosch, Arabella, et.al.     What is controversial about the set is Richard Jones' concept. Two reviews I have read on line are essentially positive: Classics Today (Robert Levine) and Opera Today. For those interested in joining the fray Google \\"Lohengrin/Munich/2009\\"; I did not care for Jones' production of Hansel but then I am not that crazy about the opera. Lohengrin, however, was the apogee of German Romantic opera combinging myth and politics. In a sense they are in this production although most detractors are already hauling out the \\"Euro-Trash epithet. It is time to put this word to rest. To my mind it suggest that those who use it are unable to make a cogent remark concerning the work. This is not to say there are no bone headed productions that will irritate, aggravate and upset any number of auditors. But generally a fresh and unorthodox take on any work of art that is being recreated iis healthy for the art form. I can easily recommend this DVD for those with an open mind; others will have to weigh the positive elements against the production values that will doubtless upsset some opera goers.

B0029LX2LC|3.0|True professional music blended with too many features. Long term roots fans will not be surprised at the beautiful flow together tracks that make this album,but may be surprised at how the roots let these semi-wack up-and-comers invade them. Almost all of the truck north,blu and porn verses should be replaced by thought or Malik B.,who doesn't appear on this album at all. Black thought seems to rap down next to these amateurs,and seems watered down (\\"lotta people countin on me kinda like a digit\\" who wrote that? lil wayne?) And has no stand out moments. If your looking at web 20/20 waiting for him to slaughter 3 minutes of beat(e.g. web), you'll be relatively disappointed. The beat is all over the place and his verse is ehhh...   And can I be the first one to say that patty crashes singing on \\"The Day\\" is cringe worthy? Am I the only one who thinks that? Basically beautiful music interspersed by a lot of mediocre verses. Stand out tracks are subjective, but I like \\"doin it again\\",\\"How I got Over\\", \\"dear god\\" and \\"radio daze\\"(Minus Blus verse,he needs to get his flow tight.)

B002VPE1PW|5.0|Attractive enough, with corner elastic straps, presumably to hold your netbook in place, but not sure why it's needed. Unless your netbook is the maximum size allowed by this sleeve's dimensions, the \\"top\\" two straps won't fit, as they're positioned at the corners. But I'm not sure why you would want to strap it in anyway, since you'll probably take it out of the sleeve to use it to avoid overheating. If you prefer to leave it in, just be aware of this - the \\"lid\\" side will not strap in unless it's an inch or so taller than that of a Compaq Mini 110.<br /><br />The zippers have the Amazon logo on them; they're not completely metal, but apparently rubber on the ends you're supposed to pull. Interesting. I suppose that decreases their scratching capability in whatever bag you'll tote this in.<br /><br />And that's all I can say about that.

B001UV4XWY|3.0|_The Box_ (2010) is a pretty gruesome film which starts from an interesting premise but I feel loses something towards the end.  The film focuses on a family on the brink of financial disaster when they are visited by a strange man who is missing part of his face.  The man offers the wife a diabolical proposition, she can choose to press a button which will result in the death of one person on the face of the earth but will be rewarded with 1 million dollars.  The premise is interesting but I felt the movie gets lost after this point especially when it turns to aliens from NASA as an explanation for the mysterious man and his box.  The film is overall fairly gruesome and diabolical in nature (taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others, etc.).  I did not however feel that the ending was that good and it ends with a sad series of mishaps.

It covers all aspects of the process from developing the right messages to story boarding to the use of space on the final slides. All of the concepts brought forth are clear and can be implemented if you want to develop a high quality presentation.     On a personal note; I despise sitting through a pitch that basically has the speaker's presentation all typed out in bullets - drives me nuts.

B002K0WBXW|4.0|\\"The Proposal\\" is what it is-an above average date movie.  The film is elevated by a superb turn by Sandra Bullock that recalls Meryl Streep in \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and Betty White as a wacky granny.  The film is diminished somewhat by Ryan Reynolds' weak romantic male lead.  Regardless, passable summer fare that's best appreciated watching with someone you love.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Like so many moveigoers of today's age, we grew up with \\"Toy Story\\". Not only was it the first fully CGI film in the United States (some debate over whether it was the first in the world), but it had a great story to boot. Such a combination, and executed so incredibly well, was and still is rather unusual. It also popularized the idea of casting well-known actors in voice acting roles. So where does this leave us? \\"Toy Story 3\\", as many know, sees Andy grown up into a teen going off to college. After a mixup having to do with trash bags and donation boxes, the toys - the last of Andy's beloved toys - find themselves in the Sunnyside Daycare center. Things appear fine and dandy at first, but it turns out that not all is as it seems.    The film starts out with a fantastically over-the-top sequence reminiscent of Andy's playtime as a little boy, which transitions smoothly into the \\"meat\\" of the film. Within the first ten minutes, Pixar somehow manages to hit several different emotional notes ranging from euphoric to sad. Those of us growing up with the series can relate to crossing the line between childhood and adulthood, so really this is a swan song on more levels than just for these beloved characters, and it tugs at one's heartstrings more than almost any modern film - if not any film, period. The rest of the movie is filled with emotional peaks and valleys that never feel out-of-place or unbalanced (Pixar has learned very, very well from \\"Wall-E\\" and \\"Up\\"). The animation quality is utterly fantastic and avoids the \\"uncanny valley\\" normally associated with computer-generated human characters. What really makes the film, though, is the belief that these are not characters in a movie, or pixels on a computer. These characters are REAL, and they feel real right up to the end.    Though I admit the montage shown in the end-credits reel sort of undermined the power of the ending (one really, really gets the feeling that this is the end and there will be no more Toy Story films), it's not enough to be bothersome. The ending is emotionally, wholly satisfying, the perfect tribute to the trilogy as a whole and Pixar itself. As far as I'm concerned, this isn't Disney. This is Pixar all the way. The ending left not a dry eye in the audience, even if it was but a prickle behind the eye. It is impossible to walk out of here without feeling as though one is really saying goodbye, physically, to these wonderful characters.    Some have said that the 3D presentation detracts from the film. The glasses make the backgrounds a bit dark at times, yes, but it's not enough to worry about at all. This film isn't about petty \\"3D gags\\" where things jump out at the audience. The effect is more like it was for \\"Avatar\\": depth of field and a sense of space. The rooms feel spacious, as if they were really there. Distances are more easily comprehensible (the landfill near the end not only LOOKS enormous, but FEELS like it, too). There is some flickering when objects move fast on the screen, but again, not enough to detract. The short film \\"Night & Day\\" before the main feature benefits beautifully from the 3D, as well.    Bottom line: the film is fantastic and well worth seeing during its theatrical run. See it in 3D if you can. Five stars all the way.
B002VECM4A|4.0|\\"Precious\\" is a film that I have a lot of admiration for but doesn't resonate with me either as it should or as I thought it should.  I scratch my head and wonder why.  The acting is superb.  The direction is stupendous.  The script deservedly won an Oscar for Geoffrey Fletcher.  Afterward I was left with a slight disappointment in the final effort.  I'm left in a quandry thinking maybe the film doesn't live up to the hype or possibly as good as the script is that the novel it's based on may be a tad thin.  Regardless, I recommend \\"Precious\\" for a multitude of reasons notably the powerful lead performance by Gabourey Sidibe that deservedly garnered her an Oscar nomination as well as Mo'Nique's Oscar winning turn as her mother that could have been cliched in less able hands.  Rod Daniels' direction is superb employing harrowing realism, voiceover, and fantasy sequences that in conjunction with Fletcher's script give the film the feel of a novel as opposed to a filmization of a novel.  Regardless, I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Precious\\" because four-fifths of a loaf is better than nothing.

B003FSTN5C|1.0|Just a horrible attempt to create a TV franchise and as such it falls flat on its perfectly tanned LA face.<br /><br />The original cast of NCIS characters developed into the tight unit we have now over time. NCIS Los Angeles looks and feels like TV my committee, trying to take what we like about Gibbs et al and translate that into a cast of quirky and spunky Angelinos and it fails horribly, just horribly.<br /><br />L.L Cool J could not act his way out of a paper bag. He has all the screen presence of an outline. The anonymous tech guys have nothing on Abby. The hot chick is a cypher - no Ziva for dang sure - no chemistry with any of the other characters. Chris O'Donnell is no Mark Harmon and as to his &#34;quirky&#34; relationship with Linda Hunt's character, its just horrible. Certainly doesn't stand up to Gibbs and Ducky, or Gibbs and whoever is Director this week. Or even Ducky and Palmer!<br /><br />What? He's not filling out his expense reports again! Mr. Callan you're such a scamp!<br /><br />When the cast of NCIS Los Angeles was first dragged across the screen in the pilot episode, I thought &#34;My God this is bad. But at least Callan is dead, so no series to come&#34;.<br /><br />Unfortunately I was wrong and for some reason that eludes me and will forever, it's actually popular. Go figure.
B002VECM6S|4.0|Whenever a movie is \\"based on\\" a true story, there's always the question of how much truth we're actually seeing.  In the case of this movie, based on the comments of others, we're indeed seeing mostly truth.  And, put simply, that truth is heartwarming (I won't get into the details, since many people have already described the story, which is straightforward).<br /><br />While there have always been ample events in the world to foster pessimism and cynicism, this movie reminds us that there's also genuine goodness in at least some people's hearts, and that goodness can transcend barriers to make a meaningful difference.<br /><br />Highly recommend to anyone looking for a feel-good movie.
B001EN1R2M|5.0|It's easy to see why this record propelled the Crue into the force they were in the 80s - all the classic elements are there - the anthemic sound, the driving rhythms, Mars' grinding guitars, and the distinctive writing style that would become one of the Crue's many trademarks.  The album is mixed so raw that it feels as if you're sitting in a 10x10 room with the group - you can practically smell the stale cigarettes and vodka as they grind through the headbanging - \\"Come On and Dance\\", and the thrashing and driving \\"Livewire\\".      You want to pump our fist as the group - probably not having access to the production they would later have - shouts \\"Too Fast For Love\\" with as much spirit as four guys can have!  The rough edges around some aspects of the groups performance only serve to contribute to the authenticity of this record, which is deservedly considered a heavy metal classic, and the beginning of one of the most successful hard rock bands of all time!

B003HLM2QO|4.0|A longtime Ozzy fan since 1981, this last decade has been filled with mixed emotions about the rise and fall of Ozzy's career. After decades of cementing himself as a whirlish maniacal frontman in front of millions, Ozzy abandoned his persona for the fame of fortune of mainstream television. His albums as of late most notably Black Rain, were more commercially driven and less the Prince Of Darkness we grew to love. The odd parting of a great player Zakk Wylde was handled poorly.  However, for now at least the Ozzy of old has come back for his latest release Scream. It's about time Ozzy, welcome back. Scream tackles some familiar themes like the state of the world, but some poignant lyrics about mortality, and calling out Jesus for his abscence in these times.<br /><br />1. Let It Die - i rolled my eyes at first but this track grows on you. What saves this song is the melodic chorus. This song kicks in nicely at about 4:20 seconds but too late. The lyrics are usual Ozzy fare, dealing with fame, naysayers, state of the world, and I'm here and not going away. Score 7.0/10<br /><br />2. Let Me Hear You Scream - I first thought this was just a continuation of Black Rain's Never Gonna Stop. This song is meaner and nastier especially in Ozzy's awesome video. The vid makes the tune but difficult to tell Gus from Zakk on this one though. Its decent for a first single but there are several better to come.<br />7.5/10<br /><br />3. Soulsucker - some of you will absolutely hate this song but there is a reason Ozzy wanted to name the cd this title. Ozzmosis comes to mind when hearing this song. It has a Sabbath heaviness and another awesome chorus from Ozzy. This song will stick in your head like it or not. Don't say I didn't warn you lol.<br />Tempo kicks it up at 2:45 and Gus rips a dizzying tapped lead. \\"I'm just a solitary man who wants to live a quiet life before when I cease to exist<br />I don't need resistance for the things I can't control. Just turn away and let it go, yeah\\" \\"Soul soul soul SUCKER\\"<br />8.5/10<br /><br />4. Life Won't Wait - Ozzy slows the pace a bit for this power ballad about mortality. Seems poignant and strangely enough makes me think of Ronnie James Dio. Good tune that reminds one of See You On The Other Side from Ozzmosis. Heaviness kicks in at 3:00 and another solid solo from Gus.<br />7.5/10<br /><br />5. Digging Me Down - don't be fooled by the nu-metal name kids. Best Ozzy tune in YEARS. Strarts off like Diary Of A Madman but then goes Sabbath on steroids. Ozzy's best lyrics concerning the abscence of Jesus during a critical time in the existence of man. Another great chorus from Ozzy and some heavy riffing from Gus. Tommy literlally beats the hell out of his drums and Blasko adds to the sonic assault. \\"Where are you Father? Why don't you save us? The fallen are dying alone.<br />How can you shut off their cries? Ignore a new genocide? So come on, Jesus, We're all here waiting just for you!\\"<br />9/10<br /><br />6.Crucify - a solid rocker from Ozzy here that conjured the era when he was a badass. Basically Ozzy insinuates he is the devil befriending and stealing your soul imo. Gus sounds a lot like Zakk on this solo, almost identical. Could also apply to the government as of late ;)<br />7.5/10<br /><br />7. Fearless - another dark rocker with lyrics similar to Crucify. It's a decent song but not exactly filler. Gus sounds too much like Zakk again on this tune.<br />7.0/10<br /><br />8. Time - love this song. This and \\"Digging\\" will battle for best song on the album.<br />Starts off in typical Ozzy ballad form the last few years but this song kicks in at the chorus and doesn't relent. Another song that will stick in your head. Reminds me of Dreamer from Down To Earth but much better. The background vocals sound corny at first but it fades. Another song about life and our short time on this earth. Great solo.<br />9/10<br /><br />9. I Want It More - another up tempo rocker and a good one. Solid chorus and lyrics about being careful what you wish for. A sample \\"Inch by inch over old bones, Shaking hands with the dead souls, You make your deal and the weight grows, Anything to get what you want \\". Fame and fortune and the hard work behind the scenes.<br />7.5/10<br /><br />10. Latimer's Mercy - ...true story about Robert Latimer who killed his own daughter who had cerebral palsy, while the family was away at church. He claims he did it out' of mercy, because she was going through such painful seizures, and he just couldnt bear seeing her in pain. A decent rocker but nothing special here.<br />6.5/10<br /><br />11. I Love You All - We have heard this before but reportedly this is Ozzy's final 1:01 second sendoff for the fans. Lyrics \\"We all must stand together now And one by one we fall, For all these years you stood by me God bless.I love you all.\\"<br />8/10 a nice sentiment for the loyal Ozzy fans.<br /><br />Overview, a very good Ozzy release that will appease some older Ozzy fans and make maybe a few new ones. Much improved over Black Rain and it grows with every listen. Seems like Black Rain 2 at first but this album is darker and more complex. If it is Ozzy's last it doesn't fix his legacy the last 10 or so years but it does make you yearn for one last great Ozzy record. Let the brilliant Gus G write his own material, he sounded way too much like Zakk Wylde.<br /><br />final score 4 starssouls, You make your deal and the weight grows, Anything to get what you want \\".

B001OQCV6K|4.0|Sherlock Holmes like many blockbusters are all about expectations. Mine were somewhat low for this film because prior to watching the film I just couldn't imagine Downey Jr. as a legit British Inspector. Well he's pulls it off nicely, giving the well known role of Holmes a comedic uplift. This will certainly be blu-ray purchase for me if Amazon.com ever lowers their price. Why not sell all movies at the same price, it's no wonder Avatar keeps outselling the other titles at $3-$10 cheaper. Yes I own Avatar too, so obviously I'm not hating on that film, just the price differece.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|Well I've given it a few listens and I'm really digging it. It does have it's moments for sure, tracks 3, 5 and 6 are awesome! However it also lacks consistency in some spots as well. The books still out on Zakk's replacement Gus G. The dude can play, theirs no doubt about that, but it's missing something? Overall it's not bad and its a step in the right direction, but it's not a return to blizzard etc. I'd easily give it a 3.8 out of 5.
B000002LMK|5.0|Freedom proved that Neil Young had returned from the wasteland that was the 1980's (or at least his eighties). However, but for a couple of up tempo numbers, that recording was more in the gentler country-folk-rock vein. Ragged Glory, on the other hand, is 62 minutes of relentless, guitar-driven rock and roll. This was the CD that the fans of Young's rock persona had been awaiting for a very long time. Once again, this time 24 years after his Buffalo Springfield days commenced, Young re-invented himself and showed the music world that, unlike his 1960's contemporaries, he was still relevant.<br /><br />I have always been a lover of Young's impassioned (some would say sloppy) guitar playing style. I find his longer solos inspiring, never boring and always exactly right for the song. It's never like they feel inserted just for the hell of it. There is something perfect about the singer-songwriter-virtuoso guitarist combination. There they are, shouting into the microphone, then they stop singing, step back, jab a couple of floor peddles and launch into a solo as they parade across the stage. I find this much more satisfying than the usual situation (The Who, Zep) where the singer either has to disappear during the guitar turns or has to develop a shtick so that he doesn't look superfluous!<br /><br />Others have noted that Ragged Glory is the perfect title for this album. They are so right. Each song is glorious and the performances are free-wheeling, spontaneous, unrestrained. A number of the tracks have a live feel to them, thus the ragged. I often tire midway through 10 minute songs - not so with Love to Burn or Love and Only Love. They are the highlights of this Cd much like the extended Cowgirl and River were the highlights of Everybody Knows 20 years earlier. Great stuff, and lots more to come!
B00007KQA3|4.0|After having seen this version more than 4 times, I find that it is the truest attempt to portray the intended Orwellian atmosphere. No film can adequately translate all of the innuendoes of a book, but this--like the 1951 version of \\"Christmas Carol\\"--very nearly succeeds.<br /><br />John Hurt is a perfect Winston: A man both living and dead. He is a frail, near-empty shell of a man, filled only with repressed anger and unsated emotional needs in a mechanistic world.<br /><br />Richard Burton's O'Brien is a refreshing coupe de gras for his final film. Understated, superficially caring and almost a subtle kindness in his tone, he too is devoid of humanity.<br /><br />Hurt's need for recognition as an individual is found in meeting Julia (Suzanna Hamilton). Initially, an attraction first based on hate--a distortion of love, they are lonely creatures embedded in the monolithic society who affirm each's need for individuality so widely crushed by Big Brother and the Inner Party.<br /><br />Most paradoxical and appealing is Burton's relationship to Hurt when the latter is caught and tortured. With a soothing, almost caring for Winston, O'Brian guides Winston through brainwashing in pain and fear. Most fascinating is Winston's admonition of love for O'Brien, an eruption of his need for love despite the traumas inflicted on him and one that essentially kills off the love of Julia.<br /><br />The dismal finale, shows Winston and Julia in an unemotional, unattached interaction. She is replaced in the same scene by his love of the State and Big Brother, the missing father figure first filled by O'Brien, then Big Brother himself.<br /><br />The subtleties are not to be missed. In this film, one viewing is surely not enough.

B0036EH3XE|1.0|This show began deteriorating back in Season 4---but  I honestly thought that, in the end, they'd come up with something mildly more interesting than warmed over new-age nonsense (\\"There is no now here, Jack\\"), spouted earnestly in front of a stained glass window bearing the symbols of most of the world's great religions (heavy-handed enough?).<br />Could this have possibly ended more poorly? I won't even get into inconsistencies, red-herrings, omissions, and mistakes----I think that the 'brain trust' who led me astray with the futile hope that some creativity could be salvaged from Network media should simply be ignored in all future endeavors. I feel cheated AND evangelized. I do feel sorry for the actors---this piece of crap probably ruined some careers.

B0034JKZ86|4.0|After watching this movie, I've finally come to understand Disney's movie strategy every year.  Basically, every year Pixar releases a movie with either all of the lead roles being male, or half of the lead roles being male.  The same year, Disney's traditional cartoon will have a female lead, or a male-female shared lead.  So for 2009, Pixar's release was Up, starring all male leads.  And Disney's traditional cartoon was another \\"princess\\" movie with a female lead.  To complete the separation, the Pixar releases are non-musical CGI extravaganza's geared towards boys while the traditional Disney cartoons are musical masterpieces that spawn talking books, soundtrack sales, etc... that are geared towards girls.<br /><br />Now to the movie itself.  Featuring Disney's first ever black leading lady, this is a great family movie.  Yes it is a \\"princess\\" movie, but there is nothing prissy or girly about it.  Instead, it is more of a \\"lift yourselves up by your own bootstraps\\" movie that would make Oprah proud, which might be why she has a small role in it.  The leading role is voiced by Anika Noni Rose, the lesser of the trio from the DreamGirls movie several years back.  She does a great job leading the movie, and her singing voice is excellent.  The songs are great; not catchy like those from Lion King but instead more modern, rhythmic and entertaining.  The supporting cast is also great, and includes a jazz-playing alligator, a backstabbing butler, a voodoo witch doctor, and a firefly among others.  And unique among Disney cartoons, a principal character actually dies at the end.<br /><br />The film is just over 1.5 hours long, which is just right for a children's movie.  The story is both original, yet derived from familiar themes that Disney has used before.  Overall, a great movie and maybe the best movie for kids in 2009.  I would say it was better than Pixar's Up.

B002WYH5N2|2.0|I admit I am a fan of the longer and older version.  I did buy this edition in Bluray and never saw it in any other format.  I did not like the seting at all.  Mr. Bennett must have had some income since he was worried about it all being entailed.  I cannot picture a pig wandering through the hallway etc.  The acting was very good but I missed some of the detail in the longer versions ability to get to know the characters better.  I think except for lydia and Darcy this was an excellant casr wasted on a mediocre script and poor staging.
B002RT69QQ|4.0|We bought this reader to replace our MobileLite (1st generation). The efective size of the new MobileLite G2 is overall shorter, but a little taller and wider. The new G2 has a feature to hide the USB connector to avoid damage to it during transportation that is embedded to the main body of the product (works sliding it in for use or out for transport). I find this feature a lot better than the original cap design that may get lost easier. On the memory compartment, the same sliding design is available. Once the memory(ies) is(are) inserted, the sliding feature protects the memory card(s) from accidental removal or during transport.<br /><br />The overall construction of the new G2 seems better than the 1st generation. I have only had it for 3 months and I haven't loaned it to anyone yet to really test the sturdiness. My 1st generation product got slip open (the carcass) exposing the electronics inside because while being connected to a side USB connector on a laptop it was hit from the side breaking the plastic cover. This seems more difficult to occur on the new G2 because it's wider body and case design.<br /><br />This new MobileLite G2 accepts 2 memories at the same time (1 SD or SDHC and 1 microSD). They show in Windows and Linux as 2 separate logical drives. On Windows XP Professional I have found that if one slot is not populated with a memory card, Windows shows a \\"I/O read fault error\\" that the user has to dismiss. Not a problem, but just an annoyance. With Linux (Ubuntu 9.10) it is a plug-and-play device, it mounts automatically. Although, I have found that sometimes one of the slots is not mounted at the first insertion of the MobileLite G2 which is fixed removing the memory and re-sitting it in the slot.<br /><br />The file transfers are very fast (as fast as the MobileLite 1st gen), of course it'll depend on the memory you have as well. Class 6 memories work awesome. I have tried memories up to 16GB with no problems.<br /><br />On the down side (not much), i found a little difficult to remove the microSD card when the SD is inserted. If the SD is not inserted, it is perfectly easy. Diferent from its predecesor the MobileLite first gen there is no slot for a miniSD (but nothing that an adapter miniSD-to-SD can't solve)to remove the microSD card when the SD is inserted.

0316010669|4.0|Start with the introductory chapter, The Statue That Didn't Look Right. If the first section doesn't intrigue or remind you of some related experience in your own life, then this book probably won't make sense. It's comprised of case studies that are mercifully light on scientific jargon and relate well to experiences we all know.<br /><br />I've interacted with and worked under people who consistently misunderstood the power of intuitive decision making. It's easy and intellectually lazy to point to a chart, a graph, a spreadsheet, or an equation and say, \\"This is why we should go this way.\\" It takes guts and willpower to rely equally on your own life experience too. You won't always be right, but I believe, as this book does, that you'll be right much more often than you think.
0060557818|3.0|*SPOILER WARNING*<br /><br />I'm really impressed by the worldbuilding skill that Gaiman demonstrates in this novel -- I know I'm going to be thinking twice next time I get on the metro. I had a hard time putting this book down when I first started it: the main character, Richard, is endearing & funny & doesn't suffer from the Gary Stu complex that plagues so many fantasy/scifi texts, and discovering the ways of London Below along with him was tons of fun.<br /><br />Gaiman definitely has a gift for creating characters who are unique and memorable. Richard was great (I love protagonists who are not all Serious Business), as was the Marquis, Old Bailey, and many of the weird and wonderful denizens of London Below. I didn't like Door particularly, though, with her amazing flame-coloured hair (that \\"shone in the dawn like burnished copper\\") and her \\"odd-coloured eyes\\" that (gasp!) change colour... I'm confused about why Gaiman fell back on such a trite descriptive route with his heroine. Also, the fox/wolf thing that characterizes the two main antagonists was beaten over and over again quite tiresomely, to the point that when Vande-whatsit \\"howled like a wolf\\" (twice) I was rolling my eyes. Oh well. The other characters make up for it!<br /><br />I'm giving this three stars because, as much as I enjoyed it, there were a couple of aspects that I thought could have used a little more work. While the alternate underground world Gaiman created was original and fresh and unpredictable, the plot itself was unfortunately not: a Revenge For Murder Of Family plotline drives the narrative (with a standard whodunit driving *that* because we don't know who killed them) & a few quests thrown in for good measure (get me the magic key, pass the 3 tests with the Generic Mysterious Order)... meh! I was definitely reading to find out more about London Below than I was to discover whether Door would figure out whodunit and slay them dramatically (which she does). There were lots of fantasy-standard Mysterious Items With Magical Properties that I thought Gaiman could have done away with as well (mysterious silver box, mysterious silver key, mysterious knife, mysterious spear, mysterious feather).<br /><br />The text could also have used some tighter editing in places, especially to avoid this kind of repetition: \\"... and approached Old Bailey to embrace him and conclude the deal. The old man averted his face and held his breath until the embrace concluded\\" -- or \\"'[...] I can rely on your discretion.\\"' '\\"You can rely on me, lady.'\\"<br /><br />Another little quibble: I would've liked the names to have been reworked/rethought as well, names do not have to relate to occupation or defining trait to quite this extent! Door (opens doors). The Night Bridge (is a dark bridge). The Golden (is golden). Hunter (hunts).<br /><br />Anyway -- my gripes are minor compared to what makes this book strong, but I did want to make a note of them regardless. All things considered, though, if you want to delve into a world that is as original as it is intriguing (and frequently quite scary), this is definitely worth a read.
B003HLM2QO|1.0|Big Ozzy fan, must be honest with myself.  I can't make myself like this just because it is Ozzy.  No melody, just crunching guitars and vocal effects.  Not one of these songs is memorable.  I give him credit for longevity and an impressive catalog. The reality is, this is not good.  I don't even like Scream, it is contrived. Maybe next time.

B003FSTN52|5.0|\\"The Good Wife\\" ranks at the very top, in the cream of the cream, of the best television series ever created. Such a strong statement needs verification. Just what makes this weekly series so powerful?<br /><br />1. Julianne Margulies, foremost, plays the \\"good wife\\" in perfect pitch. The wife wronged by her successful, ambitious, attractive, but absolutely corrupt husband (the gorgeous Chris Noth) as a fallen, disreputable district attorney, you know, the kind voters love to put back into office. Then there's the sex scandal that horribly embarrasses both his \\"good wife\\" and children? What is her reaction to his scandal? How does she cope?<br /><br />2. Her education as an attorney, no, not just an attorney, but an insightful, resourceful, brilliant attorney, not only gets her a job quickly, but proves she deserves it.<br /><br />3. Kalinda, the private investigator is the biggest mystery on the show. Just whose side is she on? Just whom has she been intimate with? She represents the ultimate pragmatist, the bottom-liner. She gets my vote as the most mysterious and intriguing of all the characters!<br /><br />4. Add the mother-in-law, who is helping out while son tries to get out of jail. Viewers eventually discover that she is one of those controlling mothers who push their children onto the success track at any cost.<br /><br />5. One strand involves the growing attraction between Margulies and her male boss whom she knew in college.  Although not the gorgeous, virile type (like her husband), he represents the intelligent, successful, but perpetual bachelor, one to be wary of.<br /><br />6. Which also includes office politics and two more fascinating characters: the driven woman partner (whose own love interest is one of the pings later described) and the young male attorney also vying for the one slot that both the Margulies character and he fiercely want.<br /><br />6. Another Subplot involves her son and a cougar-like older girl intent on using the boy for her own devious plans.<br /><br />Now wrap all this back story into the various strands that it takes to create a tightly woven plot, utterly fascinating, utterly unpredictable. Ping! What?! Yes, something came loose. What is it? Something that makes this series so gripping, so unexpected, so dramatic that viewers are on the edge of their seats, expectant, breathless. Frankly, I've been stunned any number of times.<br /><br />Addition: Two days after publishing this review, I realized I had covered only one-half of the program. The personal lives of the characters make up one-half, the other half concerns the weekly trial (after all, this is partially a courtroom drama). Each case is unique and equally fascinating. Just as in real life, each case is not necessarily resolved for the viewer's total satisfaction. Sometimes the viewer--and the attorney--don't really know if the client is truly innocent. This holding to what actually happens also makes this series a winner--provocative, perspicacious, gripping. Verisimilitude is practiced here.<br /><br />\\"The Good Wife\\" is what television should be about: quality of the highest order. This is not a series a viewer can simply tune into with the mistaken notion of joining the story. It's too complicated, too nuanced for such a cavalier attitude. That's what makes \\"The Good Wife: The First Season\\" so essential--it provides a full appreciation of this excellent and outstanding drama!

B000TEUSJK|5.0|NOTICE!!! This movie should not be watched with children around or by those that are easily offended by bizarre sexual behavior.<br /><br />No empire can live under the rule of a maniac and that is exactly what Caesar Caligula is. Raised knowing he would inherit the known world yet slave to his impulsive behaviors, and when the death of his sister-lover pushes him over the brink of insanity the world becomes a playground for his uncontrolled passions.<br />I liked this movie when it first came out and enjoy it still. Helen Mirren I've always seen as one hot maneater and she plays it for all she's got here. Peter O'Toole is one dangerous force as Emperor and Uncle to Caligula.<br />And the sets are magnificient!

B003JYOFIW|3.0|Do you like \\"Gates of Steel\\", \\"Peek-a-boo\\", and \\"Whip it\\"? If you do, you should buy this immediately, because you will hear the same rhythms, beats and keyboards all over this collection.<br /><br />To be clear, I like this, at least the first half of it. It starts off with tracks that are as well done and hook-laden as anything they have done in the past. The problems I have with it are 1) they seem to have run out of inspiration halfway through, 2) I swear I have heard all of the music tracks on previous albums, and 3) there is a sameness to many of the tracks that left me surprised I had listened to six songs when I thought I had only heard three.<br /><br />When this is good, it is very good.  I just wish there was more variety and originality.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Strip away the glitzy special effects and you've got yourself a very 70s style Irwin Allen disaster flick, with occasional smatterings of the The Poseidon Adventure and Titantic thrown in for good measure. You've seen these characters many times before (heroic mom and her ex-husband, bravely facing certain death in the devestating apocolypse now upon them - without losing their perkiness..their two precious little waifs..the good politican, the bad politician, the Russian mobster...the extremely smart scientist ...and a little dog too!)     The plot grows dumber and more predictable with every dragging minute, and I found myself wishing it would end about an hour before it finally did. Perhaps the most absurd moment is at the very end, when our heroine mom (Amdanda Peet) emerges from the ark after her death-defying ordeal perfectly coiffed and lipsticked with several hundred other survivors who didn't even appear to get wet.  When did they have time to pack or shop, and how come it took her less than 10 minutes to fall back in love with her ex-husband after the boyfriend that saved all of their lives met a gruesome end in the machinery of the ark's malfunctioning gate?     A couple of stars for the special effects - they were fun, but they're too often expected to compensate for the lack of a fresh, creative storyline. Sadly, they don't. Some bright spots though - Oliver Platt and Danny Glover turn in pretty good performances, but they would have fared better in a more serious movie. And then there's Woody Harrelson, the slightly deranged, grungy herald of the coming apolocapsye, who tips you off up front about the silliness to come.    Certainly not a recommended pick  - choose this one when you've seen everything else and have two and a half hours to kill and nothing else better to do.
B0001I55SS|3.0|Aside from just two things: a bad case of 70's new agery, and two really childish, idiotic robots (think \\"Twikki from Buck Rogers\\" and you'll be close), the story is quite good and the visuals, for their time, were really amazing.    Who knew space was so cool, with carbonite black and burgandy leather red and mahogany panel wall everywhere.    The story seems almost a rip off of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea with it's Capt Nemo, except Nemo's men were fiercely loyal by choice.    Some of the visuals are really very beautiful, even by today's standards.  The Cygnus, in silohette against the blue clouds of the black hole's penumbra.  Really nice.
B00000099Y|4.0|tool fans suck. they take everything i hate about prog AND pop and combine to make this uber-annoying person that i picture as a early 70's looking version of peter gabriel that shops at hot topic. imagine gabriel with that stupid reverse mohawk trying to convince you that KMFDM is actually a good band.     i really wonder if all the people that gave this 5 stars actually listen to all of those annoying tracks that aren't songs every single time. i get it, but as they're completely seperate entities from the actual songs themselves they were made to be skipped. which i do. if i didn't have to skip them this would be 5 stars.

B003HLM2QO|2.0|Almost everything about this new Ozzy release is unquestionably subpar and filler, except maybe 1 or 2 songs! The majority of the songs are mostly and unfortunately forgettable. Frankly, it's all been downhill for Ozzy after 'The Ultimate Sin'. Nothing can compare to the metal brilliance and melody/emotion/passion of those first few albums with Randy Rhoads or Jake E. Lee on axe. Zakk Wylde didn't come close (couldn't stand those ridiculous overblown Dimebag/Wylde type 'harmonic pinches', which are no substitute for real emotive and technical playing a la Rhoads, Lee, Schenker, Uli Roth, Iommi, Tipton, Takasaki, etc.), nor does Gus G on 'Scream' (Gus G is fantastically brilliant with his band 'Firewind' though). I don't believe Gus G was given free creative license with Ozzy's band, and it shows. The riffing and lead work is not nearly melodic and emotive enough, with 'harmonic pinches' galore ad nauseum. Ozzy's voice seems a bit too processed as well, but you have to give the legend credit for sounding OK at his age. Moreover, where are pictures/introductions of the rest of the band in the CD insert? At least acknowledge the rest of the players for chrissakes! On another note, the CD laughably comes with an insert announcing the upcoming release of 'Blizzard Of Ozz' and 'Diary Of A Madman' RESTORED TO THEIR ORIGINAL PERFORMANCES. I say 'laughably' because the last time Ozzy/Sharon re-released these 2 seminal hard rock/metal masterpieces, they 'raped' them by removing the original drummer and bass player, and replacing those tracks with session musicians, not leaving well alone! Pathetic. I guess after a huge fan outcry, they decided it best to 'restore' the original recordings with the original players.

B00003CXZ1|4.0|What can one say about a movie based on a computer game. Angelina pulls off the Lara Croft part way better than I thought possible.  I enjoyed her two British sidekicks who unfortunately mostly just stay in Croft Manor. You'll recognize Croft's butler from the British series 'Red Dwarf.'  Both he and Bryce do a stand-up job. The sets are all around the world, a bit like a Bond movie, which no doubt increased the production cost. My only complaint is the director or producer (or both) seemed to take the plot way too seriously, they should have had more fun with this. They did on occasion achieve this, such as the scene where Croft asks the Templar #2 guy, \\"Who sits here? I don't think you sit here.\\"  Pretty cheeky, there should have been more humor like this. Not the Roger Moore/James Bond tongue in cheek, but something funny yet ironic.  The DVD version had tons of extra, all of which are watching.  I hv not seen the Blu Ray version but recommend the DVD version. A bit like Bond, but with popcorn plot, not that Bond plots could be taken any more seriously.
0684857219|4.0|This book is much more than a \\"how to\\" book for bodybuilding.  It truly is an encyclopedia of bodybuilding!  Arnold goes into great depth regarding bodybuilding history, exercise selection and execution, and nutrition.      The photos of old school and modern bodybuilders are truly motivational.  Plus, Arnold's wealth of knowledge coupled with his inspiring writing style makes it a must have in your bookshelf.  My only suggestion is to work out less frequently than he recommends to avoid over training, but the remaining information is sound advice.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|A mid-budget film ($40 Mil) that doesn't look it.  Wow. Despite the money spent on special effects and the elaborate set pieces, this could easily have been a 2-star movie, or worse, if not for the writing, directing, and acting.  Don't know what I mean, watch the short video included on the disk titled \\"What Happened To Nadia's Team.\\" The short is about 5 min long, with 3 actors, and uses some of the actual set. But it shows how bad this could hv been if Jason Groff had directed it, Jeff Dixon had written it, and these 3 actors had acted it. But Pandorum the movie was surprisingly good. I appreciated that the credits weren't shown until the end; for me, beginning credits always ruin the set up and atmosphere.  The music and sounds are great, work well without being distractacting. I don't know how fast the Elysium was traveling to have reached Tanis when it did, but Tanis is over 40 light years from Earth, which means the footage filmed from the probe COULD NOT have been shown \\"live\\" on television as depicted in the movie, it would have taken 40 years for the probe's broadcast to reach Earth. That's really the only glaring technical quibble without my ruining some of the ending for you, so I won't mention any other. I've never really gotten into 'Mad Max' type baddies but I suppose this is what makes sense given the time and place of the story, so I guess they did the best possible given everything. Even so, the movie still makes me want to break out DEAD SPACE on my PS3 and start playing.  Folks, it only brought in $10.3 Mil at the box office, so we need to support dirctors and producers like this. Now that it's on video, RENT IT.  If only every sci-fi movie reached this level of quality or better we'd hv little to ever grip about.  Watch it!

A small budget must have forced the ever-repeating, episode-after-episode, same limited focus on personal strife and conflict.  Come on, you can be a little more creative, even with a limited budget.  There is a big old Ancient ship to explore, so explore it.  There are mysteries to solve, so solve a few.  There are worlds to explore, so explore them.  Really, the cubes transporting people back and forth from the ship to earth is a low budget, low imagination cop out.
B0029LX2LC|2.0|im not going to go as far as some others and call this a 1 star album, but if i could give it 1.5 stars, i would. some of the songs have a nice sound to my ears. however, the majority of the singing is soulless, the guest rappers are not that good, and blackthought has regressed as an emcee. somewhere after the tipping point, blackthought decided to no longer be a battle rapper, but a sociologist. now he is stuck in a middle ground where he does neither effectively (\\"technology turning the planet into zombies\\"? original...). so much singing in their rap, so much guitar in their live show, it is obvious that they want to go in a more rock and roll direction. im disappointed in the roots. i am happy that they have grown their music. i think the only way for hip hop to survive is for it to grow and for groups to incorporate more live instruments into their stage shows, but the roots are just moving away from hip-hop and into some sort of lite-jazz meets hip hop world. very formulaic beats and rhymes here. a very soft sound. to be honest, after rising down, i wasnt excited for any new roots album, and this mild offering proved me right. someone else pointed out this line in their review, but any time you hear blackthought spit lines like, \\"a lot of people counting on me sort of like a digit\\" you know the maximum effort is not being presented. i feel no need to get more specific than that.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|As a science fiction fan and HUGE fan of the original version, this director's cut didn't take anything away from the film.  It added elements of the science fiction aspect of the story that were missing from the original.  Yes, in the original it was more ambiguous whether or not this was all happening in Donnie's head and the director's cut gives a more clear conclusion (that it was all really happening) but why is that a bad thing?  For those of us who were wondering we now have a more definitive answer; especially if you listen to the commentary banter between Richard Kelly (director) and Kevin Smith.<br /><br />That was the real bonus from the director's cut DVD -- the conversational style of the DVD commentary made it the best I've ever heard.  The one thing that sucks about DVD commentaries is most directors will say stuff like this, \\"Oh, this was an interesting scene because it was raining that day and it took us several takes to get it right.\\"  Who freaking cares???  I'd rather know the intent behind a scene especially in a film that it is to be interpreted -- like \\"Donnie Darko\\".  That's what you get from this DVD and that's why it's a must for Darko fans.<br /><br />Overall, the added footage plus the Roberta Sparrow interpositions make the director's cut a more definitive science fiction classic; one that shouldn't be missed!

B0029LX2LC|1.0|It pains me to say this as a long-time fan of the the legendary Roots crew, but this album was by FAR the worst of their discography. I am still a fan, they have produced too much focused, intelligent, classic material over the years to abandon them. They have given so many talented singers and MC's a wider voice by featuring them on Roots projects to stop listening to them. But this album sucked folks, it just plain sucked, and while it may be hip to be a Roots fan, it's not hip to lie and say this is a five star Roots album, when it is a one star Roots album. I bought this album as I by every Roots album, sight unseen. I don't need to see an album cover, or hear snippets of the track list because it's the Roots, the closest thing there is to a sure thing in hip hop, right?     Wrong. This album has been pushed back repeatedly.(Warning sign No.1 The disc clocks in at a mere 43:00.(Warning sign No.2) Every song sounds the same as the one before it, which wouldn't be so bad except that 1)The Roots NEVER do that, versatility of style is one of their hallmarks and 2)every song before was bad. The album doesn't swing, or sing, or bang. It drones. Drones on and on and on. There are too many guests, if that's what they wanted to do then this should be The Roots Presents: Volume 2. Worse yet, they just are not that good. Much of the lyrical content is uncharacteristically banal delivered by C-grade MC's.Black Thought arguably the best MC in the game sounds uninspired, rapping by the numbers. He's playing down to the level of the comp, leaving the best lines to be delivered by others.     I hate to critize the music, because the Roots are top-flight musicians, but the whole mood of this album is dour, and that's saying alot for a band known for gritty, moody atmospheric music. Perhaps the Roots want off of Def Jam, and put out a dog guaranteed to bomb. Perhaps they are evolving, like Miles Davis' electric period. I can't believe that I am typing this, but the Drake album, \\"Thank Me Later\\" is better than this, and I HATE DRAKE!    One thing is for sure, and that's the title, \\"How I Got Over\\". If every album is a story, then this is the tale of how the Roots got over on their record company , but more troubling, how they got over on the fans.

0307594777|5.0|This whole series must surely be one of the most original ever to be committed to paper - a thoroughly unique (anti?) heroine in Salander and revolving around a investigative newspaper? Good Heavens. Even so, this whole series has been a masterpiece of plotting on Larsson's part - it is a complex web, but the writing is stark and simple that one never really gets lost in its intricacies. And make no mistake about it, it's a page turner - Larsson is not afraid to throw in the odd curveball that you're really not expecting to mix it all up, and the story just keeps on going with unstoppable momentum. This really is the perfect finish, when all the cracks that appeared in the first two books start to creak and grown and eventually the whole things falls down in a crash and a cloud of dust. I simply didn't want it to end. Famtastic.     In short, I can't praise it highly enough - not only is the whole series a brilliant crime caper, but as all great crime stories should, Larsson takes a mighty swipe at the post-war Swedish political landscape at the same time(I love Micheal Dibdin's Aurelio Zen series set in Italy for the same reason.)     Anyway, I was hooked halfway through the first (and, in my opinion, weakest) on the series, but the last really cranks up the pressure. It truly is one of the greatest crime masterworks of the decade and its such a crying shame that Larsson died long before his time and is no longer around to produce such great stories. I, for one, will miss Salander enormously.    I also liked [[ASIN:1449597300 Queen Sheba's Ring]] and [[ASIN:1449594956 At the Villa Rose]].
B000MCIBE8|5.0|First off, I am 23 years old at the writing of this review for the remix. I have been a Doors fan since I was about 14 and know how the reissues sounded very well. I am a fan of crisp sounding audio and I like to hear all the instruments. My biggest gripe with the original Doors recordings was that the drums were barely audible. Especially after listening to some Zeppelin, you want to hear some drums. These new remixes finally bring the drums way up, along with tons of sounds that were lost in the original mixes. For me, this sounds night and day better than the original mixes. I know fans growing up with the original mixes would have mixed feelings (it really sounds different...) but again, for me, this is great. The tracks really kick more than ever. They sound like you're in the room with the band rather than listening to an AM radio. Everything in the mixes sounds punchier, more audible, and just all around like a breath of fresh air. Same goes for the subsequent remixes. Break on Through sounds truly rocking... in the End you can hear Jim screaming F*** 10 times at the end of the song (seriously rock and roll... how could they have left this out!!) I would buy the remix just for these two songs. Someone mentioned the album being a more accurate speed now... I can also tell a difference. Everything sounds a bit sped up (again, better..)    Note*** This album is Remixed, meaning, they alter the levels, or volume, of each of the drum tracks, the vocal tracks, the guitar tracks and the organ tracks (sometimes bass). ReMASTERING is simply changing the levels on the two sides for a stereo situation. Remixing  will make an album sound completely different. Remastering doesn't do much. If you like the original recordings, pick up the old remastered cd's, but certainly give these a try too!!
0307454541|2.0|The author tried too hard in all the wrong places. He packed in too many characters without bothering to really develop any of them except for Salander. He laid out a story within a story but once I finished reading the mystery of the missing girl, I really didn't care about the rest of the other story which had another 150 pages to unfold. I wish I could toss it up to \\"lost in translation,\\" but I'm afraid this novel just wasn't well written no matter what the language.

0061703257|2.0|Took a while to get going, but the middle was wonderfully written, suspenseful and mysterious in that wonderful dream-like way.  Then the whole experience unravels into disbelief.  The author, Dennis Lehane, broke character and scene far too often to provide clues and red herrings--so proud of his big reveal--which was anything but.  After so much potential, I hate to say it left me bored, eager to get to the last page just so I could put it away.  There are many amazing psychological thrillers out there--but this is not one of them.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|The overall quality of the movie was good, but the movie skips and freezes periodically. Never experienced that with a new DVD before. Would think again before purchasing another from them.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Fantastic music and just like I remember.  Often artists change the song a bit, but the majority of these were just like I remember.  I sang along just like I used to.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|One of the best action movies that I've ever seen. The movie is not complicated to understand. Sparta is being threatened by Persian King Xerces and his army for its land. Leonidis, King of Sparta will not bow to the tyrant king, but cannot declare war and send all of its army into battle(total bull****). Instead he and 300 committed spartan warriors travel to meet the enourmous persian army to stand in its way of taking control of Sparta. Battle scenes are some of the best out there. Although there wasnt CGI in ancient times, it makes for a lot of fun battles. Five out of five hands down.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|If you believe everything happens for a reason, and view life without envy, bitterness and contempt for those more fortunate......you will love this book!!  Piper is well educated, young, white, and able to adapt to prison.  She does her time, lives to tell about it!  That would have been enough (for me)....but she is also working in a field to make a difference for women so much less fortunate than she was.<br /><br />Hooray Piper !!  :)
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|Resident Evil is arguably the best zombie game series of all time,before Dead Rising and House of the Dead. The story starts off showing how the T virus was started in the hive by someone close to umbrella and why. Will let you find out the rest from there. Claire and Chris unfortunately do not appear in the movie, however Milla Jovavich took my attention away from the missing characters. She is the real deal. Sorry guys she's all mine!
B000BQPC3S|5.0|Katharine Hepburn had a lot riding on this film.  Two short years before, in 1938, despite two superb films to her credit  \\"Bringing Up Baby\\", the classic screwball comedy, and the gentler \\"Holiday\\", both costarring Cary Grant she had been named box office poison in an influential poll by motion picture exhibitors. Her studio RKO took notice & coupled with badly slipping box office receipts for her films let her buy out her contract.  No other film offers were forthcoming, so she returned to the Broadway stage in this play that was written with her in mind by Philip Barry, and scored a bull's eye.  She shrewdly buttonholed the screen rights so that any studio that wanted to buy the property would have to take her as well, plus she also had casting approval of her two male costars.    MGM, the Rolls Royce of Hollywood studios won, but vetoed her original suggestion for costars, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, both were considered too big to support her.   Cary Grant and James Stewart were the substitutes offered, (much better casting in my opinion), but the studio did agree to her choice of director, her favorite George Cukor.  Hepburn wanted a critical AND box-office triumph, plus an MGM contract, she got both!    The story of course is set in Philadelphia, rich, arrogant, young Main Line socialite Tracy Lord (Hepburn) is on the eve of her second wedding to stuffy, up and coming businessman George Kittridge (John Howard).  Complications ensue when Tracy's first husband C.K. Dexter \\"Dext\\" Haven (Grant) shows up at her parent's mansion with a writer and photographer for \\"Spy\\" magazine respectively Macauley \\"Mike\\" Connor (Stewart) and Elizabeth \\"Liz\\"Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) who are romantically involved with each other to cover her wedding for the magazine.   The reason is blackmail; \\"Spy\\" publisher Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell) will not publish a scandalous story about Tracy's father and a dancer in exchange for an exclusive story on Tracy's wedding.    Dext has arranged this, but Tracy is furious at the notion, even though Mike and Liz are unaware of this unsavory agreement.    The relationship between Tracy and Dext is a contentious one, as shown in the wordless comic prologue between them at the movie's beginning, although it seems that Dext may be carrying a torch for Tracy.   To further muddy the waters, Tracy is estranged from her father Seth Lord (John Halliday) due to his alleged affair, and he has still not arrived for her wedding, so she palms off her delightfully lecherous Uncle Willie (Roland Young) as her father to the unsuspecting Mike and Liz.  Add to this Tracy's smart-aleck adolescent sister Dinah (Virginia Weidler), who has no use for George and is a partisan of Dext, plus Margaret Lord (Mary Nash), their dithering mother, and the fact that Tracy and Mike start to become attracted to one another, and the comedic and romantic possibilities abound.        Initially, Ms. Hepburn's Tracy Lord, although a bright, beautiful and elegant thoroughbred, is not very endearing.  She's judgmental, unforgiving, haughty, brittle and dominating.  Despite all that, you can't dislike her, because in Hepburn's skilled playing, you can sense the untapped potential, and that her true character is still in formation.   Little chinks appear in her armor.  When both Dext and her father give her some uncomfortable home truths as to her perceived coldness, it hurts, and we see the vulnerability she's kept hidden up to now.  Tracy starts to question her relationship with George when he gives his perception of her as a pristine goddess on a pedestal to be worshipped, protesting she doesn't want to be worshipped but loved.   All this bewilders Tracy, and makes her less self assured, but also more likeable.   Events come to a crescendo the night before her wedding at a party where she lets down her guard with a vengeance to interesting results that will further humanize her and change the course of her life and character for the better.   Hepburnplays this tailor made part to perfection, the viewer gets to experience every facet of her blazing talent in this her comeback film.  Cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg lit her beautifully, never before had she looked quite so gorgeous and desirable.  Renowned costume designer Adrian created very stylish, chic ensembles for her, & the viewer is even lucky enough to see her curvy figure in a bathing suit, (one piece, but still!) which may have been a first for her!      The Oscar won by James Stewart is usually considered to be a consolation prize for losing the year before for \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\", but I don't know if I agree with that assumption.   He has a difficult job in convincing the viewer that he is a serious threat to Cary Grant for Ms. Hepburn's affections, yet he brings it off.    He still has the awkward, gangling grace, but there is for the first time a slight edge to his character, foreshadowing his complicated screen characters after the war for directors Capra, Mann and Hitchcock.   He's not quite the innocent Mr. Smith; you get the feeling the relationship Liz and he are sharing is way past the \\"dating\\" phase.   The centerpiece of his performance begins when Tracy and he are alone together in the wee hours of the morning after the big party in the garden of the Lord home slow dancing, gliding expertly around the ledge of a reflecting pool drenched in moonlight.  Both look their impeccable best, and the erotic tension between the pair is palpable as first they verbally fence with each other, yet continue to be drawn closer. Then the passion bubbles forth out of the Mike in ardent poetry, \\"You're lit from within Tracy, you've got fires banked down within you, hearth fires and holocausts!\\" he's burning brightly with desire, his face is aglow with it, and he dazzles the already susceptible Tracy.   This sequence may have earned him his Academy Award, but his awful yet funny off-key rendition of  \\"Over the Rainbow\\" while carrying the deliciously tipsy Tracy also could have helped, and perhaps gave the young Judy Garland a giggle as well!    Although, he snagged top billing, Cary Grant's part is not as showy as his two costars, but it is a key one, nonetheless.   He is the catalyst to the whole situation, directly or indirectly causing the various events that occurs.   Grant plays Dexter in a relaxed fashion as a young man who has had personal issues to resolve, but has finally found his way, and is comfortable in his own skin.  He has empathy for those who are struggling or stumble on life's path, but also has a droll humor and the ability not to take life too seriously.   Katharine Hepburn and he play off each other beautifully; he was her perfect male co-star, bringing out the best in her until Spencer Tracy came along.       Ruth Hussey as Liz completes the leading quartet of players; she is bright and attractive, with her wry quips and is a steadying influence for the impulsive Mike. The rest of the cast is equally good led by Roland Young as the lusty Uncle Willie, and Virginia Wiedler as the precocious Dinah.    Screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart adroitly opens up the action outside the stage while retaining the wit of the Barry original and justifiably won his Oscar for his efforts.   Finally time to acknowledge director par excellence George Cukor who shows yet again why he was almost without peer when it came to the genre of sophisticated romantic comedy.  How well they succeeded is that seventy years later this film still remains vintage Dom Perignon, effervescent and sparkling!
B0025KW29U|5.0|Great musical, and well worth buying even if you have seen it as you also get \\"Commentary - The Musical\\".  There is an actual commentary too.  Well worth the price, if you have enjoyed it before, its worth buying.  If you haven't seen it but are a fan of Joss or the actors, its worth the risk.
B00005JMJG|4.0|.... Jim Carrey, I mean. He almost made me forget that he is eternally, recurrently, ineluctably \\"Ace Ventura, Pet Detective\\"! Almost, I say. He is a masterful actor, and he plays the sad sack Joel as plausibly as anyone could. But whatever slouch he adopts, whatever stubble covers his chin, he's still The Grinch, Loki, Truman, and above all Ace! Ventura! At some fundamental level of thespian craft, he fails. He needs the help of Dr. Mierzwiak to erase MY memories of his previous roles.<br /><br />Kate Winslet has no such handicap. It never occurred to me to remember her in any other role. In this film, in the role of the 'impetuous' Clementine, she's every man's worst memory. If I'd survived hooking up with Clementine in my flaming youth, I'd pay to have the memory erased also. But this is a film about Recurrence - endless cycles of predestined Recurrence! - a Kosmic Kharma Komedy. \\"In this whole world / you can love but one girl / let me be that one girl / I'll be true to you\\", as the Shirelles sang when I was a teenager, with the implication that 'not only will you never be able to forget me after I dump you but you'll always always find another me.' In other words, this film is more a tragedy than a comedy, a coy examination of how vulnerable we humans are to our own psyches. No, amigos, that is NOT a happy ending.<br /><br />But there's also a meta-message in the film: we are what we remember. Tampering with the brain, with memory, is risky business, a Dr Frankenstein trick. \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is a sort of science fiction film. Plausibility isn't relevant. We the audience are supposed to think deeply about its implications. That might be where the film falls short; it's too zany for its concept to be taken seriously. All the flashbooks to memories being expunged, while Joel is unconscious, clash too bizarrely to stimulate much empathy. Joel at half size, hiding under his Mommy's kitchen table, is .... wait! He's ... Ace Ventura Pet Detective!<br /><br />I skipped this film when it was first run. Who remembers why? But I had to see it now, after watching the film \\"Synecdoche New York\\" by the same screen-writer Charlie Kaufman. Frankly, \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" seems like a practice piece, a warm-up for the powerful expressiveness of \\"Synecdoche\\".<br /><br />My wife watched \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" with me. She insisted that I include, in any review of it, her protest against the demeaning (she said) portrayal of the three women characters. But she also gave me permission to declare that the film was \\"entertaining.\\"first run. Who remembers why?

030745455X|5.0|I was in a hurry to get a vacation read, inadvertently bypassed \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" and bought \\"Fire.\\" To my delight, this second part of the Blomvist-Salander trilogy has an independent plot that refers to previously introduced characters and relationships, yet does not need to pause to explain them. A multitude of characters, all with non-English names, populate this thriller. Since in presenting them, Larsson alternately used their first and last names, it took me several pages to readily identify to which group a supportive character belonged. Is she part of Bublanski's police unit? Is he one of Armansky's employees? Is he on Blomvist's magazine staff? Yet, placing the characters did not slow my reading. Actually, the convergence of these collaborating - and competing teams - enriched the realism. The villains are over-the-top bad; but, Larsson expertly escapes drawing caricatures. He brought them to life in all their viciousness and ineptness.<br /><br />Even a mystery as good as this one has to have predictable points. \\"Fire\\" has two: Lisabeth Salander is not the killer and she will outsmart the law and the lawless who are trying to find her.  With fluid prose, Larsson has written something much bigger than a crime novel. Through Mikael Blomvist, the intrepid journalist and Lisabeth Salander, the genius justice-seeker, Larsson`s words will continue to amaze readers worldwide. Another writer said, in part, about Larsson: \\"He would not tolerate derogatory opinions of others based on their secondary characteristics, such as ethnicity or gender...and he would not suffer even previously close friends once he had reason to believe that in fact they harbored racist, sexist or prejudicial views.\\" Thus, Larsson has infused his two heroes with his own ideas of social justice. I've just opened \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and lament that \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" will be Larsson's final publication.
B002ZFQD0Y|5.0|I was an avid SOAD fan when they were at their prime, but don't expect the same sound from this CD/DVD. This album has a very classical feel and I cant stop listening to it, Not 1 track I disliked. 5 * all the way
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I have been waiting and waiting for all \\"Daria\\" to be available on DVD! To me, it is one of the best things MTV ever put out. I watched it non-stop as soon as it showed up and I was not disappointed! Everything I loved when I was watching it broadcast originally was still there! Favortie line: Daria, referring to teaching, \\"...the stress level of neurosurgery and the payscale of a video-rental clerk...\\" Missed that the first time - but I didn't the second time!! Wonderful! If anything, I appreicate this even more now that I teach high school! Technical note: the one difference from the original is tha tsome of hte music had to be changed due to copyright issues. This was stated in the opening of the DVD and I personally did not notice a significant change. (The voices in the opening credits did not sound quite right -  that could have been it.) If this aspect matters that much to you, you might be disappointed but if you are mainly about the satire and sarcasm, get ready for it! Fantastic to have \\"Daria\\" at last!
0061673730|5.0|I greatly appreciate the condition and timeliness of the book's arrival.  The book itself is a great read for anyone who wants to see a different point of view.
006145205X|5.0|Condensing the sweep of human progress in trends that ultimately show that our best opportunities for a better world are already trending - if we can continue to specialize and trade freely. This is not a light book yet a lively and engrossing one, well-served by the intellectual rigor and pithy, opinionated prose of a very smart writer.  I was pulled in and highly recommend it for anyone who wants a deeper look at how our history has taken us to a time of great opportunity to make a difference.<br /><br />In this sweeping review of the steps of civilization Ridley refutes the \\"pessimists\\" (he includes in this pack, Al Gore, Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein Al Franken and John Gray) who, he says are saying that a) the world is a terrible place; b) it's getting worse; c) it's mostly the fault of commerce, and d) a turning point has been reached.<br /><br />While I disagree, in part with his characterization of their stances I found eye-openers in the depth of his historical review of the growth of work specialization and trade - and how those trends have helped people live better lives.  Along the way he disproves Paul Erlich's warnings on population control and the commonly-believed view that the world is getting more violent, among many other topics on the path of progress  toward a hopeful future as he sees it.<br /><br />A central argument of this bookis  that the special feature of human intelligence is that it is collective, not individual - thanks to the invention of exchange and specialization.<br /><br />This is an ambitious book, cogent, sweeping and a primer I would hope every college freshman would be required to read as it covers economics, history, anthropology and more, setting up the opportunity for critical thinking and discussion.<br /><br />Near the end of the book Ridley pulls together the many threads of his argument for an optimistic future with these bold forecasts:<br /><br />\\"I forecast that the twenty-first century will show a continuing expansion of catallaxy - Hayek's word for spontaneous order created by exchange and specialization.  Intelligence will become more and more collective; innovation and order will become more and more bottom up; work will become more and more specialized, leisure more and more diversified.  Large corporations, political parties and government bureaucracies will crumble and fragment as central planning agencies did before them. ...<br /><br />Monolithic behemoths, whether private or nationalized, are vulnerable as never before to this Lilliputian assault.  They are steadily being driven extinct not just by small firms, but ephemeral aggregations of people that form and reform continuously. The big firms that survive will do so by turning themselves into bottom-up evolvers...<br /><br />The bottom-up world is to be the great theme of this century.  Doctors are having to get used to well-informed patients who have researched their own illnesses. Journalists are adjusting to readers and viewers who select and assemble their news on demand. Engineers are sharing problems to find solutions....<br /><br />Politicians are increasingly corks tossed on the waves of public opinion.  Dictators are learning that their citizens can organize riots by text message. `Here comes everybody' says author Clay Shirky.<br /><br />Other memorable points for me:<br /><br />* People will more and more freely find ways to exchange their specialized production for diversified consumption.<br /><br />* \\"'The online masses have an incredible willingness to share' says Kevin Kelly.  Instead of money, `peer producers who create the stuff gain credit, status, reputation, enjoyment, satisfaction and experience.'\\"<br /><br />* Among the pitfalls we face, predators and parasites can piggyback on the work of others and be free-loaders. And they can spark terror or spread a false belief:<br /><br />*  \\"The integrated nature of the world means that it may soon be possible to capture the entire world on behalf of a foolish idea, where before you could only capture a country, or perhaps if you were lucky an empire.<br /><br />* In responding to the pessimistic forecasts of others that things are getting worse he suggest, \\"It is precisely this `inevitable' misery that is the reason for pressing on urgently with economic progress, innovation and change, the only known way of bringing the benefits of a rising living standard to many more people.  It is precisely because there is so much poverty, hunger and illness that the world must be very careful not to get in the way of the things that have bettered so many lives already - the tools of trade, technology and trust, of specialisation and exchange<br /><br />* It will be hard to snuff out the flame of innovation because it is such a evolutionary, bottom-up phenomenon in such a networked world. However reactionary and cautious Europe and the Islamic world and perhaps even America become, China will surely now keep the torch of catallaxy alight, and India, and maybe Brazil, not to mention a host of smaller free cities and states....<br /><br />The experiment will go on. So long as human exchange and specialization are allowed to thrive somewhere, and then culture evolves whether leaders help it or hinder it, and the result is that prosperity spreads, technology progresses, poverty declines, disease retreats, fecundity falls, happiness increases, violence atrophies, freedom grows, knowledge flourishes, the environment improves and wilderness expands.<br /><br />*  Why are specialization and trade vital to the progress that improves more lives according to Ridley? \\"Two individuals could each have two tools or two ideas while each knowing how to make one. Ten individuals could know between them, ten things, while each understanding one. In this way exchange encourages specialisation which further increases the number of different habits our specifics could have, while shrinking the number of things that each person knew how to make.

0767020308|1.0|I won't say it's a bad adaptation. I have seen all three adaptations from Paltrow to Garai. This version tried to be faithful to the book but because of the limited time, it feels like they were rushing the story. However, the worst thing about this version is the casting. Emma is so boring that I would have said Kate Beckinsale is a terrible actress if I hadn't see her in another movie. There is no chemistry between Emma and Mr. Knightley. Harriet Smith looks more like a gentleman's daughter than \\"Mr. Robert Martin's good match\\". Jane Fairfax's reserved character was not properly expressed. She is just beautiful, that's all. I am so disappointed at the casting. None of them struck me as perfect. I think the best version of Emma is Romola Garai's. The casting of that version is perfect! I heard some viewers saying that this version is more faithful to the book (and I understand thier complaints about other versions because I say the same thing about Harry Potter movies, being a great fan), but I'd rather see a version that is only loosely based on the book and is enjoyable than see this version of boring Emma.
B0016J81B4|5.0|bought it so, I could wear comfortable croc shoes at work which meets work standards. Only complaint is no vents, so shoes over heat, but over all a good shoe.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have seen three versions of Emma so far and this is the most perfect one. I won't say that it is the most faithful to the book. However, I have something to say to \\"hard core\\" Austen fans who complain about how a movie version of any Austen book is not faithful to the original book and so on; as an avid Harry Potter fan, I complain the same thing about HP movies. But what we need to understand is that they are not making photocopies of the book on screen. They are making movies \\"based on\\" the books. We should allow the movie makers' immaginations and interpretations and see the movies as an individual piece of art. Now, about this version, I should say that it might not be the most faithful adaptation of the book ever made, but the casting is just perfect. The actors make the book characters come alive for us. Especially, the chemistry between Emma and Mr. Knightley is very pleasant. The other actors are also perfect in their parts, maybe except Mr. Elton who, to me, doesn't fit well inside Mr. Elton's person. I highly recommend this version of Emma. It is so perfectly enjoyable (if you're not obsessed with the original book so much).
143911000X|3.0|I was expecting something more. The book is basically just like Barney makes it sound in the series. It's a list of rules, most of which are mildly humerous/somewhat entertaining. Something good for reading on a train but hardly worth buying in my opinion.
0061906220|5.0|Great library find & now I'm going to buy my kids their own copy via amazon. By page 3 my boys were hooked. They are ages 3.5 & 2.5, both are begging me to read it again and again. What a fun & very cool book. From the song to the guessing game of colors and the beautiful ending. it's kidfriendly, educational and not a boring kids book. Fun Fun Fun! Well done guys!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Prob one of the Best, Finest, Outstanding movies of WW2 ever made.<br />The film is brilliant, great directing, great acting, great script!<br />I enjoy the little tidbits of humor that is thrown in..like when Patton walks around the corner and kicks the Prvt in the butt....clasic! Or when the Chaplin asks Gen Patton if he ever finds time to read his Bible, Pattons answer is terrific.<br />Get the DVD, sure you seen it a million times but it's a must own film.<br />Classic one liners from the movie:<br />\\"What about the Americans? Don't they need a Hero too?\\"<br />\\"Well they have their schedule and I have mine\\"<br />\\"Ask them if they want us to give it back\\"<br />\\"Lodas, Lodas\\"<br />\\"Today I thought I'd stand up here so that you can see if I'm as big a son of a Bitch as some of you think I am\\"<br />\\"If you defeated Rommels plan, you defeated Rommel\\"
B000068R1X|3.0|This album isn't bad, but it isn't great, either.  The fact that it followed Diary of a Madman and Blizzard of Ozz didn't help it any, either.  When this album came out, my expectations for it were sky high, based on it's predecessors.  Also, the title track was playing on the radio at the time, and as we all know, that song is a MONSTER SONG.  I was foaming at the mouth waiting for this album to come out!  Then I got it and...phttt.  So Tired, You're No Different, Waiting For Darkness, etc...only the track 'Bark at the Moon' compared to his previous works.  I was so disappointed in this album that it took me years (and several GREAT albums) to finally have any appreciation for this disc at all.  The tunes aren't horrible, and some are even quite catchy...they just don't quite fit the criteria of what I consider 'Ozzy' songs.  Again, not a horrible album, just not a great one either.  If you're an Ozzy fan, you've got to get it just for the cover and the title track, though.  Both of those ARE great.  And if you're like me, you have to have it just because it's Ozzy..
B003K07DUC|4.0|I just rented and watched this movie and also before hand read most of the reviews here. For those of you reading these reviews and wondering if its a good movie to watch please continue to read. Almost every negative review I read seems to have come from someone with a political view of this movie, which almost did have the intended effect of making me pass this film up. What I want to say is don't let these people try and stop you from seeing a good Matt Damon movie. This movie (with all political views set aside) was a good action, suspense, and intrigue movie plain and simple. Even the claims of horrific rocky, headache producing, camera shooting (which also seems to suspiciously come from those same reviews with political motivation) were mainly false. Yes, the camera did move about some but nowhere near as much as some reviews would have you to believe, and personally I didn't even notice it with all the good action going on. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT INSULT OUR SOLDIERS OR THE GOOD WORK THEY DO WORLD WIDE IN ANY WAY I COULD SEE!    For those of you who feel compelled to blather your political views on us all in the form of a simple movie review please don't bother. I think most of us here just want to see a good movie and \\"Green Zone\\" was a good action flcik.
B000068QZK|3.0|This is a solid album with some very good songs on it, but not one of the songs is great, imo.  Miracle Man and Breaking All the Rules come closest, with a bunch of other solid songs on it (Crazy Babies, Hero, Bloodbath in Paradise, Fire in the Sky).  However, this album also contains some of Ozzy's worst songs ever, such as Devil's Daughter, Tattooed Dancer, and Demon Alcohol.  It took me a long time to get into this album until I realized that if I simply skipped over those three songs, this album is actually pretty good.  Again, this is a good album (minus those three bad songs), but not a great one.  I would definitely recommend it for all fans of Ozzy and/or Zakk Wylde.
030726999X|5.0|This book was an \\"all-nighter\\"!  I could not put it down.  Of the 3 books in the series, this had to be the best yet.  Loved it!!!!
B000002B7O|5.0|Let me first say, I don't have this remastered version...mine is the old-school \\"digitally remastered analog recording\\" featuring all of the original artists (Ozzy, Randy, Bob Daisly and Lee Kerslake).  That said, I've got to tell you that, in my humble opinion, this is not only the greatest Ozzy CD ever made, this is the GREATEST CD EVER MADE!  I love Metallica, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Dio, Van Halen (Dave version), Godsmack, COC, Iron Maiden...you name it.  However, this is the album that really hooked me into metal as a kid and it has never lost it's luster even one little bit.  It stands alone at the top of the heap for me with both Randy Rhoads at the top of his game and Ozzy at his most crazy, over the top, insane best and every song is top notch metal.  Both the title and the album cover say it all...this is truly a Diary of a Madman.  Again, I can't vouch fully for this remastered version, but if it's even close to the original, it's well worth it.  10 stars out of 5!!!
193413712X|2.0|I usually love first novels because they are fresh with insight and and something to say.  Sometimes they are a bit rough, but the originality is more than worth for me.  Tinkers was disappointing because it was hard to follow and I found the writing to be so-so.  The story of a father and son was intertwined which in theory forms a good foundation for a book, but Tinkers did not deliver. The symbolize of the inside workings of clocks was used (I love antique clocks and have about 12 of them), but it was not used effectively.   On the jacket it states in part, \\"Tinkers is an elegiac meditation on love, loss, and the fierce beauty of nature.\\"  In my opinion the book didn't rise to this level, because I didn't feel deep empathy for either the father or son and the book did not convey to me the beauty of nature.  I think Paul Harding has talent with good ideas for novels, but I believe he needs to review how he conveys these ideas to the reader.  I would not recommend this book.
B000002B7U|5.0|Before I tell you abot The Ultimate Sin, let me first tell you that I was extremely disappointed with \\"Bark at the Moon\\"  as a kid when it came out.  It followed two great classics and fell flat, imo.  So, when 'Ultimate Sin' came out, I didn't know quite what to expect.  Let's just say that after listening to the first track that first time, (the title track), I was completely stoked!  What a great song!  Okay, I said, Bark at the Moon started with a great song, too, and then fell flat.  So I continued to listen to the album and, lo and behold, IT ROCKED!  This was my favorite album in High School, and I quite frankly don't understand anyone dissing this.   Great songs include, Ultimate Sin, Never, Never Know Why, Lightning Strikes, Killer of Giants and, of course, Shot in the Dark.  This is one of my all-time favorite Ozzy albums and will always hold a special place not only because of the time it came out for me (High School), but also because it resurrected Ozzy from the relatively weak Bark at the Moon.  Highly recommended.
B003A4IFGY|2.0|Huge Petty fan, had great expectations, but this record isn't close to a classic Tom Petty release. Should have been released under a different band name, very disappointing!
B003ICWTR4|5.0|How anyone could rate this any less than 5 stars mystifies me. I've been a fan since 1975 when \\"Born to Run\\" was a new album and have stuck with Bruce through thick and thin. I've seen him solo and with the E-Street Band 9 times since 1978, have about 25 live shows on CDs and LPs and this DVD is nothing short of brilliant. One of the highest-energy performances I've ever seen from the man and the song selection is incredible. The cover of \\"London Calling\\" must be making Joe Strummer smile from beyond (and it's not that well-known that Joe was a huge Bruce admirer) and the closing video of \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is spine-tingling.     Over the years I've known many people who just never \\"got\\" Springsteen, but they've never doubted the quality of his work. If a show like this can't turn you into a believer, then nothing will. BTW, the video and audio quality are fine throughout, so I don't know what some of these reviewers here are expecting.    If this really is the last we hear from the E-Street Band (and I'll bet it isn't), then they're going out on the highest note possible.
B00361DR4Q|5.0|I thought that the Franco Zeffirelli film starring Placido Domingo and Teresa Stratas on my copy of DVD was great.  But, except for a bit of audio glitch, this is a good example of Blu-ray at its best.  Video is so sharp and detailed on my 92\\" CRT projected screen that all emotions on the performers' faces hit me like never before.  For the first time, I keenly felt the anguish portrayed and couldn't hold back my tears.    A must own for all opera lovers!
B001N26GFM|5.0|Excellent choice - I bought this as a gift and it arrived within 3 business days.
B003102JDM|5.0|What makes this wry comedy special isn't the humour.  Although you'll have a smile on your face much of the time (certainly not at the ending), there were only a couple of laugh out loud moments.  Rather, it's the thought-provoking and stimulating storyline about a Jewish college professor, Larry Gopnik, whose life seems to be unraveling, and who seeks spiritual guidance in vain.<br /><br />His wife is leaving him for another man.  His psychologically impaired brother has moved in, stirring up even more domestic turmoil.  He is up for tenure but someone has been sending anonymous letters of complaint about him to university officials.  He has to deal with a difficult Korean student, and the student's father, who offer to bribe him in exchange for a passing grade.  And he has money problems.<br /><br />Gopnik comes across as something of a pathetic sap who could solve some of his problems by just standing up for himself, but his ultimate fate is apparently beyond his control.  The ending could have been written by Schopenhauer.  Even though I don't agree with, or like, the movie's message, I still respect and admire the way it has been put on film.<br /><br />Aside from the fact that it probably helps to be Jewish (I'm not) when digesting the film, the only problem I have with it is that I kept waiting in vain to find out the significance of the film's beginning: a supernatural(?) scene in what appears to be 19h century Poland.  I don't know if I missed it, but I was unable to see any connection between this opening and the rest of the movie.<br /><br />With all the garbage that is churned out by Hollywood nowadays, A SERIOUS MAN is a real gem of a flick, albeit an ultimately depressing one.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This book is both entertaining and informative.  It is an easy read because Michael Lewis is a great writer.  He is able to explain all the investment instruments that were part of the sub-prime mortgage collapse.  He explains them in a way that makes you understand them.  The people in the book are written about so well that you are interested in what happens to them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand what happened on Wall Street during the past decade.
0802473156|3.0|I purchased this for our Christian book club summer reading.  It was enjoyable.  If we first notice communication problems with our spouses, probably this is an excellent book to read.  But if a couple who already is going through heavy and serious problems such as domestic violence, addiction, or infidelity, nothing in this book would apply.  I would recommend this book to a younger couple who has just got married.
B001FB5634|1.0|**SPOILERS** Charlize Theron does so little in the film in terms of scenes She might has well have been listed as cameo. While it has a good story and what I mean by that was the BOOK, this film was dreadful. The trailer was promising but the boy simply cannot act, Viggo looks as if he would rather be somewhere, anywhere other than doing this film and it just crawls. The lame cart dragging scene will draw a few laughs. I was almost asleep 20 minutes in! If you want post apocalyptic Book of Eli was much better. Also please note the trailer makes this seem like an action film...There are maybe TWO MINUTES tops of action in this entire film. I encourage you to read the book though, it was very good.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Disclaimer - I am not really into workout videos, however I know that structured practice is useful in any endeavor, and videos are can be a very useful tool when it comes to workouts, etc. Out of the half dozen or so belly dance videos I've seen, the only one I really have liked is Aziza's Ultimate video because it's pretty intense and Aziza's personality makes the video fun.    I previewed Rachel's new video set yesterday and before the \\"How to use this video\\" section (which I watched first) was over, I knew this was an excellent purchase. The video is broken down in to sections and subsections (as others have mentioned) of technique discussions, yoga warm up and cool down, shimmy drills, hip work, upper body work, leg strengthening (which would be challenging to almost any athlete) and routines. The video is structured in such a way that you could do just one or two sections and get a complete \\"work out.\\" Or you could take an entire afternoon and go through the entire video set. The DVD is set up specifically in this way and in the \\"How to use this video\\" section, Rachel reviews suggested practice schedules for those with other things to do in life, and those with more time to focus on dance.     Each section is detailed and thorough. The thing I ADORE about these sections is nothing is rushed. Other dance videos I have worked with seem to rush through things - you can tell that the artist is cramming as much as she can into one hour. In this video set, there is no rush... Rachel takes her time, in REAL TIME, to go through everything at a pace that is realistic. For example in the yoga section, when she says \\"take a few breaths here,\\" she is actually taking several slow yoga breaths!! I haven't even gotten that kind of realistic pace in an actual yoga class!! There are sections that are great for anyone, and sections (shimmy drills especially) that will be a real challenge to even advanced dancers (which I am not.)    Speaking of realistic, I also love how Rachel's presence in the video is very \\"real,\\" especially in the mini-courses section. I was able to take her choreography workshop a couple months ago, and was tickled pink that she used the very same moves, techniques, etc. from the workshop (albeit much more abbreviated in the workshop since she had so much material to cover) in this video, and her speaking style in the workshop is the same as in the video. Her personality comes out well in the mini-courses section, and during the shimmy drills section and a few other points in the video you can see her personality peek out with smiles and thumbs up... all while maintaining a very professional and relaxed demeanor. I also like how she has reminders to check posture regularly - she actually adjusts her own, and it's nice to see that even Rachel Brice has to double-check herself.    In short, I would declare this the best $25 I have spent on belly dance.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|I really enjoyed this film! Totally different from the other Vampire films out there. Well Directed and Filmed and good acting. Check this film out :)
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|This is the kind of shlock SF/action thing that, regardless of reviews or how bad the ads look, I nearly always have a gut desire to see - and which all too often disappoints.  Having gone into this one 8 years after its release, having studiously avoided it and its sequels and knowing almost nothing about the plot or the game it was based on, I have to say that I was somewhat pleasantly surprised, at least at first.  No, it's not a great film or even a particularly good one, but in the hands of a director who is even remotely competent or interesting, this could have been a solid entry into the action/horror/sc-fi arena.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the director we have here is Paul W.S. Anderson, who has managed not only to have a fairly productive and lucrative career but also to marry the fabulous Milla Jovovich, his leading lady in this film and the sequels.  The only other PWSA film I've seen is ALIEN VS PREDATOR, and this is certainly a notch above that film, but it still shows plenty of examples of poor editing and narrative construction, dull and ugly action scenes - excepting a couple where Milla gets to kick butt on her own - and fairly obvious and trite horror movie clich&eacute;s in abundance.<br /><br />What's good about the film is mostly Milla, who I wouldn't say gives a terrific performance exactly, but who does exude a presence, show some nice physical grace and power, and communicate reasonably well the character of a woman just starting to come out of memory loss - and to realize just how much the mega-corporation that she and nearly everybody else works for has betrayed them all.  She is Alice, apparently a former security professional for the Umbrella Corporation, and she has seemingly lost her memory as a result of some kind of nerve gas.  She awakens in a fancy mansion that turns out to be a secret portal to the underground Hive, a supercomputer that runs nearby Raccoon City and is a breeding ground for all kinds of unorthodox experiments.  Alice has to accompany - and eventually lead - a team of commandos into the Hive to see what's gone wrong with it, and along the way they encounter those most boring (to me) of currently popular horror icons, zombies.  Somehow an anti-aging virus developed in the Hive has this unpleasant zombifying side-effect, and the Hive has killed off all of the scientiests within.  Except, of course, that you can't really kill a zombie.<br /><br />Like I said, there are some good action scenes with Milla, and there's also a nice sense of claustrophobia at times - it seems like the Hive might go on forever - but on the whole this wasn't any better than \\"OK\\" for me, and it sure wasn't helped by the dreadful bang-your-head-against-the-wall music by Marco Beltrami and Marilyn Manson.  I guess it's what the kids like.  But to be fair, this probably does feel a lot like the videogame - lots of action and blood, paper-thin story and virtually zero in the way of characterizations.  Well, being a hardcore fantasy and SF viewer, I've certainly seen plenty of worse stuff.and eventually lead - a team of commandos into the Hive to see what's gone wrong with it, and along the way they encounter those most boring (to me) of currently popular horror icons, zombies.

B002NPY7FE|5.0|Cujo has always been one of my favorite movies and when I saw this movie available on Blu-ray I just had to get it to add to my newly started BD collection. It was a decision that I don't regret. I think the transfer to Blu-ray was a decent one. It's not perfect by any means, but well done. Any Stephen King fan or a fan of Cujo in general will appreciate having this in his/her Blu-ray collection.<br /><br />The only complaint I would have is the cover art for the case... I agree with other reviewers, for a 25th Anniversary Edition, they should have gone with the original movie artwork. But, I don't think it's a big deal if you enjoy the movie.<br /><br />One of the things I look for when purchasing a Blu-ray disc is the extra features compared to the original DVD. This edition does not disappoint. It has a pretty lengthy behind the scenes feature that I think fans of the movie will enjoy. We get to see the actors views of the movie 25 years later, which I thought was interesting.<br /><br />Well, what are you doing wasting time reading this and other reviews, add this movie to your cart. I think you'll enjoy it! It's only $11.49 at the time of this posting!
B003ICWTR4|5.0|The first official DVD of an outdoor Springsteen show is by leaps and bounds the best Bruce DVD so far, bootleg or official.  The outdoor setting and the gigantic Hyde Park crowd completely change the perspective on the show from any previous DVD.  You can see deep, deep, deep into the crowd unlike the previous indoor show DVDs.  And so many of Bruce's most loved songs tap into the summer evening vibe that this is the best setting they have ever had.  To see Jungleland at dusk sent chills down my spine. There has been a bootleg in circulation of an outdoor show in Berlin from the TOL tour, taken from a German television network's feed, but this DVD's production values blow that one away.  The picture quality, the number of shots, the number of cameras, the number of stage hands and staff, the number of songs, the covers of London Calling and Good Lovin - this is a the first show to capture the sprawling, wild, innocent magnificence of a Bruce Springsteen outdoor show. A very special treasure for Bruce fans.
B00164GDE6|5.0|i love this movie very much, good acting good cinematography. I had this movie from laser disk and then upgraded to DVD and then to bluray in order to have a good quality picture and sound. About the movie, dont hestitate to own. You will not regret because the action is fisrt class and funnier than ever :)
1423101499|5.0|This book was sent as a gift. It is one in a series and the receiver is   very pleased with it.
0446563048|5.0|I was one of the lucky people to get an advanced reviewers copy and from the moment I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Tony's writing voice is so authentic, it feels like he's your best friend telling you these amazing stories over a couple of drinks. It was entertaining and real and when you put the book down at the end, you realize it is also filled with incredibly valuable lessons.<br /><br />Like, a strong culture is key to the success of a company. And people come first in business. And long term gains come from making short term sacrifices. And nothing great was ever achieved with ease. Tony's work hard/play hard ethic is incredible and the reason he's grown such a rabidly enthusiastic audience.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anybody starting any business...or even if you've thought of starting a business. Tony is the type of leader I wish we could replicate over and over.
B002K0WBYG|5.0|Yes, it is spun cotton candy movie that goes with my \\"Doris Day\\" DVD shelf. What's wrong with that?<br /><br />Sandra Bullock and Betty White are standouts in this movie. Ryan Reynolds makes a strong male lead and the supporting cast are just as terrific.  It is a true romantic comedy that evoked many laugh out loud moments no matter how many times friends and I view it.  An improbable plot, Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock), needs a quickie, no fuss, no mess green card since she is about to be deported and orders her business assistant, Ryan Reynolds, to make it happen.  The dialogue between the two leads is witty, smart and funny.  Of course this leads to romantic disaster followed by more romantic disaster, and finally true happiness and love. Yes, it is a bonafided \\"Chick Flick\\" (as my husband never stops pointing out while he rolls his eyes) and a really wonderful one at that!<br /><br />Enjoy the movie!
B001FB5634|3.0|I have appreciated Viggo Mortensen's work for awhile now,   he has alot of presence onscreen.  But this film could've been so much better than it was.   It had a lot of potential to be a breakout film for him, but key points  from the book which were really needed (in my opinion) to really bring  the viewer into the story and make them care more about the characters  as well as explain alot that was fuzzy about this film were either missing   or whizzed by, meaning they were briefly touched on, then they moved on to something else.  There were also places that draaaaagged on which brought little to the story.  The direction was not as good as this book or cast deserved for one...  Viggo Mortensen, Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall...those are heavyweights.  But you can only be as good as what is written on the page and what the   director gets out of you in a performance.  The kid that played the son, Cormac McCarthy, could wrench your heart out   in one instance, then he could be kind of annoying too!  I never did completely buy him in that role...Sorry.  Anywayz, in closing....another okay film which makes an interesting rental.
B002VPE1YS|4.0|This nifty quilted bag does the job well. Fits my wife's camera and protected it nicely on her recent trip back home. It isn't fancy, but practical and just what we needed.<br /><br />However, the frustration free packaging leaves much to be desired. While the small box which held the bag was a cinch to open, it was encased in a two foot long plus box that was sealed tightly and very hard to open. My wife thought she was getting flowers as the multi-foot long Amazon box looked like what flowers are delivered in to her store. Once we hacked into the main box and got it open, we had to wade through and discard lots of packing paper to get to the very small box holding the bag. Why a small book box was not used for shipping I have no idea.<br /><br />So, the bag is great but the packaging is very bad.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This was a movie that I rented first to see if I would like it.  A good friend recommended it to me, and I must say that I was very impressed  with the story of the young woman who went on to become the longest reigning  monarch in british history...Queen Victoria.     When most people think of her, they think of the old uptight frumpish   Queen with the stern face who seemed frown on everything that was good & fun,   and exclaim in the third person that \\"We are not amused!\\"    Her name was lent to a whole 19th Century age of uptightness, sexual repression,   censoring of independent thought, etc., but the reality is that she was a very  strong-willed and passionate woman who learned to be tough out of necessity to combat   the treachery, intrigue and power-playing that goes on behind the scenes of any monarchy,   especially in the times that she came into being.   It was so interesting to me to see her (played masterfully by Emily Blunt)   as a young woman, who was very much a woman in every sense, born into very privileged   and yet very demanding circumstances.   She had to overcome being manipulated and controlled by those who would seek to use her   youth and inexperience against her for their own selfish ends, as well as the fact she  was a woman in a time when women weren't valued for their intellect and patronized  in very demeaning ways which no self-respecting woman would tolerate in this day & age!  But more than all of this, this movie is about the deep and passionate love affair  that develops between young Victoria and the young handsome Prince Albert.  Rupert Friend was a great choice to play Albert...he had that regal bearing to the max!    At first he is pensive and gaurded in his affections towards her and she seems to   really like him but is aloof and too caught up in her new role as Queen to take   him seriously. When a severe misstep in judgement turns many of her subjects against   her, and the drama of the affairs of court start to grow to betoo much for her,   she reaches out to young Albert, who is all too willing to be there for her both  as a friend & confidant as well as much more.   The attraction between them that was on slow burn then ignites into full-on courtship   and soon they are married and he is king consort to her ruling queen.   After a brief period of kind of lingering in the backdrop as she excutes her duties as queen,   he makes it known that he doesn't just want to hang around and look pretty...  he wants to actively help her with her affairs.   She understands his position and acquiesces.  He then proceeds to clean house!--Rearranging things from the running of   the royal household, to auditing the financial affairs of court, etc.,   he is also a great counsel for her and her eyes and ears for the things   she can't see coming through the sea of smiling faces and \\"yes your majesty's!\\".   Soon she is with child and they are both very happy, then he commits what she sees  as a dire faux pas at a royal function where she percieves that he belittled   her in front of members of the aristocracy and they have a big verbal fight!  I liked the fact that though Albert knew that SHE was indeed the reigning party and   he merely the king consort, he was not going to be a kept man who was   basically a royal bejeweled eunuch! He was a man of noble blood, breeding, and of   an extremely self-possessed nature! (In other words, he wasn't taking her gump!)  He states his position and apologizes if she felt he was out of line,   then he excuses himself in the heat of the argument.   But Victoria hasn't formally excused him and tries to assert  her power over him by ordering him to stay in the room with her until   the argument is over!---She DEMANDS that he stay on!   But he firmly but cooly bids her goodnight and leaves.  She is furious!!---And the next day, when she gets in her royal carriage   to ride through London for a stroll, she is still miffed at Albert, who had   earlier promised her that he would ride with her. He gets into the carriage and   Victoria tells him not to speak to her...he plays along, though he's clearly not as   mad at her as she is with him.  Then a would be assassin takes aim at Victoria and fires!  Albert's first instinct is to protect her, and he throws his body into  the bullet's path, sustaining a serious injury to his shoulder (?).  Victoria is beside herself with guilt for her behavior and grief over the  close call of almost losing the man she loves! And she now knows, for all points  and purposes, without a shadow of a doubt, that he loves her too!  From there, they co-reign and maintain a beautiful relationship for 20 yrs until   Albert's untimely death from typhoid at the age of 42.   They also have 9 children together who become ruling aristocracy in other european   countries over the latter 19th and early 20th centuries.  Queen Victoria goes on to become the longest reigning monarch in British history  and for the rest of her life, she wears black, in mourning for her fallen love...King Albert.  Everyday she has his clothes laid out and a place set at the table for him until  she dies in 1901 at the age of 81.  Their love transcended even the grave!    Even though nobody else in my house would watch this film with me because   they thought the subject matter to be too boring, it's their loss, because   this is a great movie! Great acting by both Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend,   as well as the supporting cast.  Great direction, cinematography, costuming...everything about it was top notch!  I highly recommend this film for those who want to see something with a bit more  substance than the usual standard modern movie fare.   It's a worthwhile film in my opinion and I fully intend to add it to my collection.
B002VPE1X4|4.0|With news of the death of my mother-in-law, I knew my wife was going to need something to protect her camera for her plane trip back to her childhood home. As it happened, the vine newsletter arrived at about the same time and I selected this bag and one other for the trip. While she used both extensively, she preferred this one as it is sturdier and has the inner pockets to place other items. It held up well though it did seem to collect dust and dirt on occassion.<br /><br />What we did not like was the so called frustration free packaging. It wasn't. The small box that held the bag came in a multi foot box which was finally opened by use of a hunting knife. Not only was that box more than two feet long, it was filled with wasted paper to hold the very small camera case box. Having gotten lots of books for review from publishers over the years, as well as via the Aamzon Vine Program, I don't understand why a small book box was not used to ship the item. Instead, what was done was not only annoying but a huge waste of resources.<br /><br />My four star rating applies only to the camera bag. Amazon shipping in this case earns no stars and the rating for the bag should not suffer for  employee shipping stupidity. Amazon can and should do much better.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|This show gave me hope for the future of a good show. Kind of like when \\"The Dark Knight\\" came out.     It's quite simply awesome. Great story and AMAZING casting. Bryan Cranston is my favorite actor.    The only thing that dislike is how explicit the pilot is. A lot of uncomfortable parts in it that make me think, who would want to watch this, and \\"Man, it must have been really awkward recording this scene.\\"     But besides that, its my favorite show now. I suggest buying the rated version off of iTunes though.
B0007PAMEM|4.0|I agree with some reviewers that this is a compilation and nothing new but I think the way the songs have been selected is a nice one. The first song production, a mix of multiple performances, is amazing.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I have been watching Gerard Butler's career since he starred as the phantom in the Andrew Lloyd Webber masterpiece movie, The Phantom of the Opera, released in 2004.  Gerard Butler was one of the producers of this movie and it was a perfect role to show his versatility as an actor--he truly was \\"the star\\" of this movie.  Another reviewer made the comment that Denzel Washington would have been better in the part played by Jamie Foxx and I agree--but then again, I really like Denzel Washington's work in cinema.  This movie gets your attention from the first few minutes of the movie and continues to the end--although I think they could have deleted the very last scenes of the movie and ended it with the last prison scene rather than with Jamie Foxx and his family.  Very unusual and clever if you enjoy a lot of action and thriller movies.  I first rented the movie and then bought it after viewing the rental.  I liked it!
B0007LCNKM|5.0|Being a newly inducted fan to a band that deserves so much more than they seem to have gotten, I have to toss my hat into their ring. I continue to get a late post- Velvets vibe on repeated listening....I hear John Cale channeled via the Psychedelic Furs. There is a darkness at work and an almost visceral sense of abandonment/loneliness/emptiness in the slower numbers while the more upbeat tunes show glimmers of sunlight lining the edges of the clouds......great work
B001PKHS68|5.0|I was amazed at how sharp and colorful the picture is on this edition, better than some bluerays out there. In fact, after just buying Kellys Heroes on blueray and being very disappointed in the picture quality, I will look more closely before buying blueray and consider dvds remastered in high def. Also this is a great movie, in a series of great movies Hitchcock made in the 50's beginning with Dial M For Murder and ending,imo, with North By Northwest. This movie is much lighter than the rest, and while some dislike it for that reason, that's why it's a favorite to me.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This movie has world class audio engineering, soundtrack, voice acting (Japanese, I haven't listened to the English dub), and animation quality.  There are plenty of reviews on the storyline already, but solely as a blu-ray this product delivers, and I would highly recommend it!

B003J27WFW|5.0|I'd have to say this is must-have for any serious Rush collection. Great insight into the band from the very beginning to the present<br />with some rare footage, even a clip with original drummer John Rutsey. If you're a Rush fan like me then this is a no-brainer.<br />[..]
B003KRJNBW|3.0|This is passable entertainment but a more realistic portrayal of the downfall of western civilization would be The Road. The Book of Eli is Denzel Washington as super hero, sort of.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Start with the first book. Then pull out some pencil and paper to draw a character tree for the who's who. Then read for a week, non-stop. where oh where are the good writers now? RIP Steig.
0307454541|5.0|Larsson took a while developing the sometimes quirky characters, but that only made the mystery and drama that more compelling. Getting into the second half, it was hard to put down. I enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so much that the next book I bought was The Girl Who Played With Fire.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Certainly a top choice for desert island discs. This album and Close To The Edge are Yes at the top of their game. Fragile paved the way for the technical virtuosity necessary for Close To The Edge.

0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis always entertains, and The Big Short is no exception.  Mr. Lewis was a bit behind the curve, and thus follows several excellent books about the Wall Street shenanigans, such as The Greatest Trade Ever and the Quaints.  However, Mr. Lewis puts his own imprint on the events and as usual, the book is full of pithy metaphors and a sense of \\"can you really believe these people really believed their business models, their invincibility and most of all, their press?\\".  Mr. Lewis' description of his lunch with John Gutfreund is priceless and serves as a poignant epitaph to the greatest financial crisis since the Crash of '29 and the Great Depression.
B0000640VO|5.0|There are moments in life, all-too-rare, when you experience something that becomes a part of your life because it somehow, inexplicably, touches your soul. Perhaps it is a painting, a novel, a song, or a movie. Last winter, someone recommended Am&eacute;lie to me. My life was changed the moment it started.<br /><br />As I watched, my heart cried, my soul opened wide, and I fell in love...with a movie. I mean, the whole movie; the colors, the actors, the words, the language, the story, and the music, oh the incredible music. It is pointless to explain the plot or get into specifics. How do you dissect pure beauty without detracting from its overall power?<br /><br />There are very few things I recommend to everyone I know, especially to those who I hold close to my heart. Am&eacute;lie is one of them. I plead with you - watch this movie.<br /><br />As I go through life as a divorced man in my forties I realize I have learned a lot about what it is that I would need from a partner. It isn't a long list, but the requirements are essential. One of them is that she must adore this movie.
B00004SA86|5.0|First of all, for the Mahler neophyte, it is important to note that if you want the best possible recordings of every symphony, then I do not recommend purchasing a boxed set.  Even the best boxed set cannot have every single symphony be of outstanding calibre.  You will get a collection of symphonies with some being much better than others.  However, there are great advantages to having a boxed set, especially if you are interested in a particular conductor or a particular ensemble, or if you just want a solid reference recording of each symphony.      That being said, you need to know what you are looking for in Mahler.  If you are an admirer or devotee of Bernstein, you will absolutely hate this set.  It is the complete antithesis of the late romantic rather gothic melodrama which Bernstein offers up.  It is part of the trio of Mahler recordings, along with Bernstein's and Haitink's that contributed to the so-called \\"Mahler boom\\" of the '60s, and, as such, the recording quality will reflect this.  However, the playing is simply divine, and few conductors seems to appreciate the structures of each of Mahler's symphonies, and few give such down to earth, almost Bohemian renditions of Mahler, one which emphasizes the many folk elements that Mahler incorporated into his works, as well as the intricate contrapuntal structures which make a Mahler symphony such an interesting experience.  Kubelik is in a class of his own.  And Kubelik holds to this conception of Mahler throughout each and every single symphony.  I assure you you will hear something you have never heard before each time you give Kubelik a listen.    Perhaps the single greatest strength of this set is the wunderhorn symphonies (symphonies 1-4).  I am willing to guarantee you can find better recorded performances, but you will never hear better played.  Kubelik and the BRSO shine throughout, and the faster tempi are much appreciated on my part (I have always preferred by Mahler tempi on the fast side).  The excellence of this tetrarchy alone is reason enough to give Kubelik your consideration.    As for the 5th, I would have to say it is absolutely superb, but I rather prefer Walter's 5th, especially because his adagietto is around 7 min, while Kubelik's and many others clock in at around 10.  This may seem a minor detail, but the adagietto cannot sound mournful or weepy.  It destroys the internal coherency of the work, which is an exploration of tragedy and triumph, with the scherzo being the centrifugal force that holds these themes together and blends them seamlessly into one another.  But the adagietto should be a much more loving movement.  That being said, again, a fantastic symphony as well.  Kubelik's adagietto avoids that trap!    The 6th and 8th have some balancing issues.  At times, certain instruments may come across as too strong for the texture, and, at others, certain instruments don't come through as strongly as they need to (especially some low brass parts in Mahler's 8th, and be advised, the upper register of the BRSO dominates these recordings.  The low brass, especially the trombones do come through when needed, but they don't particularly stick out of the texture very often.)  Unlike others, I do NOT have a problem with Kubelik's tempi in the 6th.  Far from it, I regard the quicker tempi on the set to be a great strength.  The 6th symphony has always struck me as a Greek tragedy more than anything, so thank you Kubelik for not condemning our hero to death from the first beat!!  And the faster tempi conform more accurately the classical structure of the symphony.    The 7th and the 9th are also very good.  Kubelik does a fantastic job of bringing out every part of the complex texture of these symphonies!!  I have heard instrumental colours that I have never heard before out of each of these symphonies (and this holds true for every one, but especially these two).  Granted, I would like more low brass in the 7th and I would prefer a little more passionate intensity in the opening movement of the 9th, but the sound is very Bohemian in both, and very much so true to the structure of each symphony.  The last movement of the 9th is absolutely beautiful, though it is not the best in the catalog.    In short, the Kubelik set is an outstanding set of Mahler symphonies.  The sound is very lean and crisp and the interpretations are very down to earth.  I can't recommend this set highly enough.  A great value for the money and an important historical \\"document\\" of the Mahler boom and a wonderful antidote to the syrupy and very emotional performances of others.  However, as a first set for the complete neophyte to Mahler, I must voice some reservations.  Be aware that you are getting a very idiosyncratic approach here.  Kubelik does things with Mahler I have never heard from another conductor of Mahler.  This gives the set its great strength, (such as the first movement of the 3rd symphony, I have never heard such a menacing rendering of nature, which ties in wonderfully to the older idea of nature as a force of destruction, rather than the common view of nature as paradise that was the common conception of nature of the intellectuals of the Romantic era.  Pan doesn't just arrive, he kicks down the door!) but it also makes the set rather unorthodox.  Be sure you understand what you want out of Mahler, what kind of sound appeals best to you, and, above all, just enjoy this rather fascinating man named Gustav Mahler and the complex and beautiful music which he wrote.  Again, the Kubelik set is easily one of the most consistent I have ever heard, and as time goes by, I come to appreciate it more and more.
B00275EHJG|5.0|There is a scene near the end of Toy Story 3 that took me by intense surprise, the core Toys (Buzz, Woody, Jesse and a few others) are faced with the prospect of destruction. I won't go into detail as to how, but in this scene, Jesse states \\"Buzz, what do we do now?\\" and Buzz, turning to Jesse with a deep sadness and longing showing on his plastic face; simply grabs her hand and squeezes. Jesse in turn grabs the hand of Bullseye and the chain comes full circle with Buzz and Woody grabbing hands.  This moment was shocking in it's deepness, how toys could make me feel sad, yet uplifted by their intense love for one another, and that these toys could come to terms with their \\"death\\" because of the love they share.      This aforementioned scene is one of the reasons I so truly love Pixar films.  The depth and emotional resonance that John Lasseter and his group of magicians put into every fiber of their films. Their understanding of love, their ability to show loss in a simple and understandable yet heartwrenching way, and their ability to show toys, fish, or insects how to let go.    The beginning and end of the Toy Story legacy is with a child.  15 years ago, we were introduced to Andy; a fun loving cute little guy who was madly in love with his toys.  The strong and kind Woody, the brave and stalwart Buzz, the sweet yet scared Rex, The feisty Potato Heads, the loyal and loving Slinky and a few other adored toys made up a family of playthings held together by one thing, the love a little boy.  His imagination could make them soar and they felt blessed each day.  Along the way in Toy Story 2 we picked up Jesse and her best pal Bullseye the horse.  And in these films we saw the love and companionship these objects had for one another.  A love that would help them get out of some VERY sticky and genuinely scary situations. But all road lead back to their BEST friend...Andy.    That is the heart of Toy Story 3. What happens when your Best Friend grows up? Are you a has been? a nothing? just so much trash? If the boy you adored and who adored you back grew away from you, where do you go? Would you feel betrayed? indifferent? scared silly? or would you hang on to that love til the last breath? This is the story of Toy Story 3, when by accident, the toys are sent to Sunnyside Day Care. A bright and sunshiny haven on first look, but a sadistic toy prison run by a bitter toy under it all.  Do you succumb to your predicament or fight to get where you belong?      And what of that child, what does he wish for his friends? All these questions are set up, played out and answered by the end of this magical and spellbinding film.  Now to the technical, the voice cast was once again superb.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the voices of Woody and Buzz play so well off each other. Joan Cusack brings a sensitivity and strength to Jesse that is uncanny. And the rest of the cast is fantastic as well, and ALL the original are back save Jim Varney and one other whose name escapes me. The graphics are; as always for a Pixar film; amazing.  The toys themselves never looked so good.  They have a sheen and detail the 1st and 2nd lacked.  The story as I've said is enchanting, hitting notes of hilarity, concern, and deep deep sadness and loss. But does all this make it a perfect film? In my opinion...Yes.    Toy Story 3 is Pixars 11th feature film, and in my opinion surpasses ALL previous films. Yes, even Wall-e. The mix of perfect casting, enchanting graphics and a pitch perfect story that takes us all on an adventure but lands safely in the perfect and only place.  The last few minutes of the film is a perfect closure to this wonderful franchise, yet a beautiful opening to a whole new life for the toys! A life blessed with the love of a child. You'll walk out feeling like a child again yourself, yet with a deep sense of loving closure.     Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece.
B000002VRZ|4.0|This is a great collection of Outlaws songs.  I liked them then; I like them now.    I already have a lot of this on vinyl, but the digital remastering is worth the price, as is the convenience of having these songs in one place.    If you are familiar with the Outlaws, there is no new ground broken here.  If you are not, then sit back and enjoy the guitar interplay and the excellent harmonies.    Green grass and high tides--forever.
0312370849|1.0|The idea behind this book is wonderful, but it was a terrible read.  It was incredibly dull and the writing was average at best.  And the short chapters were just an annoyance.
B003A02W0I|5.0|A strange asteroid is discovered buried in the arctic ice. Does it hold evidence of extra-planetary life?<br /><br />Deception Point, unlike Dan Brown's later stuff, (which can be heavy on religion and mysticism), is just a scientific and political thriller. It's my favorite of the bunch. The science seems plausible rather than outrageous, the Washington politics are largely possible, and the adventure plus chase is tons of fun. The characters are sympathetic, though not especially memorable. The twists are not telegraphed. I enjoy a book that will take me to another world. The combination of the alien nature of Washington backroom politics in conjunction with the bleak cold of the Arctic is just the ticket.<br /><br />I have only two problems with this book: the survival of NASA could not realistically drive so much mayhem. And there's a bit too much engineering explanation about the technological devices. I don't need to know all about robot insects to get interested when a character get stung in the eyeball with one. But I suppose all that techno-explaino is a Dan Brown hallmark.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I got a 5th Gen nano for running because my old iPod was too cumbersome to wear on my runs. This armband protects the screen with a hard plastic... the plastic scratches, but it does not make it hard to see what is on the screen. I haven't had any trouble accessing the clickwheel while on runs. It stays in place very nicely on my arm, which is about 9 inches in circumference. I have to strap it as tight as it goes, so  it might not fit if your arm is much smaller. I have sweated profusely wearing it and it has not touched the iPod. Also great just to wear around to do dishes or clean up. I can't recommend this enough.
081297381X|2.0|There are some very interesting insights in this book, but it is a tough slog.  The writing is sloppy and encumbered with too many self-absorbed side-tracking musings.  A good editor might have made this book good.  The good news is that it is very easy to put down and walk away from it, so the commitment is not too overbearing once you start it!  The concept of a Black Swan as an unexpected event might well become incorporated into common language, so kudos for this.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This is a great CD.  I am really enjoying it.  I have listened to it everyday.  The CD, jacket and pull out are all very cool.  The CD is worth owning.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I am interested in nature documentaries, and watched Attenborough's entire Life collection, as well as his version of Planet Earth. I can't stand the stupidity of the American narration -- they're not just changing the accent, they're changing the entire script to remove all educational content.     Here is an example, instead of talking about how the venus flytrap senses when a fly enters, the American version just inserts silly sound effects of jail doors slamming, ticking stopwatches, and pitiful calls for help from the trapped flies. This isn't an exaggeration, this is literally what happens in the American version. Get the Attenborough version instead if you have any interest in learning.
B00004TJKI|4.0|\\"Anatomy of A Murder\\" is well done, and the actors are fantastic in their foibles.  Jimmy Stewart stands out as he plays a small-town lawyer battling against all odds to convince a jury a man is innocent because he was temporarily insane, or has something called \\"irresistible impulse\\".  The plot surrounds an army lieutenant (Ben Gazarra) who shoots a bar owner for raping his beautiful wife (Lee Remick).  Stewart's performance is impeccable and the courtroom scenes are tense and riveting.  Everyone who testifies has faults and the imperfections come out in the testimony.  George C. Scott plays the opposing attorney and keeps the tension building to the end.<br /><br />The movie was filmed in black and white during the 1950's.  It frames the morality of the time and reveals the gray areas.  \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\"  probably had a bigger \\"punch\\" at the time, but still holds up well.  The only criticism is that it is an overly long film.
B003MWHVLY|5.0|I have only one word to describe this album \\"WAO\\"<br />Since I discover Sia accidentally at Pandora Internet Radio I can't stop listen Sia's Music. A couple month ago Sia was totally<br />unknown to me but immediately I heard songs from previous album she is one of my favorites artist right now. I bought all her previous albums and just on time she release this wonderful work.<br /><br />Nice beats, songs with meaning a truly gift for my ears. And before I finish the cd at no.13 was \\"Oh Father\\" a cover from Madonna song<br />i always love when artist do covers from other artists and this version is amazing...just amazing<br /><br />Sia I just wish one thing: Please do a concert in Miami!!!

B001IAOEXU|4.0|I found that these triggers make my controller feel much more functional.  I never had a problem with my fingers slipping off L2 & R2, but this gives me a much better grip.  These also snap on really well and feel like they are made of the same quality as the original triggers.<br /><br />I would have paid quite a bit more for such a quality product!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie was superbly done in terms of cinamentography and special effects.  It also flows very well for a film over two hours long.  The storyline is borrowed from history with a twist on the European/Indian dynamic in the new world, this time with the Native people not losing everything, at least not until Avatar II?

0756405890|2.0|So... I've read 250 pages of this six hundred something page book and I don't think I'm going to continue. I'm not particularly surprised that so many people enjoyed it. I enjoyed it when I had nothing else to do. It's a pretty generic fantasy novel that borrows a lot from other fantasy novels. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it just didn't work for me. I have to agree with a lot of the one-star reviews on here: can't relate to the protagonist who is a perfect genius with just enough flaws to be human, flat characters, the barf-worthy love scenes, and poor writing (I keep noticing obvious grammatical errors, which is just irksome). And the Chandrian aren't really effective as scary bad guys, which is kind of a lot coming from one who had to read the later Harry Potter books with all the lights on.      So my advise would be to not bother unless you've got nothing better to read. Even so, with 520 out of 711 people raving about it, I guess I'm in the minority here.
B0010KGEUE|5.0|Love, love, love this album - one of their best! Full on Blues A-la Stones - get the whiskey out!
B000VUDSH6|5.0|I love this movie.  The title of the movie makes it sound lame, but don't make the mistake of juding this book by its covered.  It's kind of like \\"3 Men and a Baby\\" meets \\"Police Story\\".  Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that it started out slow.  I kept putting it down when I was trying to get through the first bit, but wanted to give it a chance because of all the positive reviews.  I'm certainly glad I did!  I finished it up quick because I could not put it down.
B00364K6YW|4.0|Video worked wonderfully and the movie series was great! Only played video once but have had no problems -- color and sound were good.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Beautiful color, slow starting, fantasy with a moral old world verses new world.  I loved the story and his choice.
1416594787|4.0|As someone who delights in Richard Dawkins' explorations of biology, I'm often also frustrated by his virulent attacks on creationists (and the religious in general). Of course, I can understand how his antipathy developed after years of battling intolerance, but bitter sarcasm does not make for good PR. Due to his often aggressive attitude, Dawkins ends up souring the image of atheists and scientists in the view of the general public, instead of getting them to understand, and get excited about, the science that so captivates him.<br /><br />\\"The Greatest Show On Earth\\" is probably the closest thing the world is going to get to a Dawkins book that simply basks in the wonders of the natural world, without too much interference from his characteristic vitriol. TOO MUCH being an important qualifier here, for the book is still peppered with some digs at individuals ignorant of the science that supports evolutionary theory. And this is the main reason for which I left off a star. This could have been THE book for honestly undereducated individuals (those willfully counter-educated are another matter) to learn about the way our world works, and have a lot of fun doing it. That is, if it weren't for Dawkins' recurrent referral to this same demographic as \\"history deniers.\\"<br /><br />Again, I understand his frustration with well-funded, politically muscular groups that actively combat biological science, but his crude generalization of even innocently ignorant individuals as \\"history deniers\\" is a constant insult to a crowd that surely could benefit from the book. Talk about a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />That said, the book is endlessly informative and entertaining, and shows off Dawkins' characteristically geeky sense of humor more often than his more infamous acerbic side. I also recommend the audiobook version for the author's (and his wife, Lalla Ward's) charming delivery of the text.<br /><br />Highly recommended; just try to ignore those pesky bits of sarcasm he just can't seem to get rid of!
B001HN6940|5.0|What a different look into \\"Wonderland\\" than the \\"Wonderland\\" I remember gowning up as a child.  I loved then color, and some parts of the story.  Johnny Depp played his part wonderfully.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|1st -  there are some spoilers in this review so if you don't want to see them, stop reading now.<br /><br />2nd - this product is not released yet, so this is not a review of the quality of the dvd or blu-ray picture, 5.1 sound, cover art, special features or anything else about the DVD or Blu-ray release that you can buy here on Amazon.<br /><br />3rd - this review is of Season 6 and it's relationship to Seasons 1-5.  And, whether or not is it worth spending your money on purchasing it and watching it.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />A masterpiece of character development.  It provides a final conclusion to the interpersonal relationships between a number of the main characters and resolves the main plot love triangle, the sometimes passionate, volatile, and adversarial love affair, between Jack, Kate, and Sawyer.  No, Jack and Sawyer don't turn out to be homosexual lovers with Kate watching from the nearest closet.  It also finishes up and provides closure to the love relationships between the few characters that have been featured over the previous 5 years.  Again, nothing controversial.<br /><br />Great acting and cinematography.  Again, the actors and actresses did a fabulous job.  Especially the actors that played Ben and John Locke.  The camera work and choice of tropical settings are superb.<br /><br />The characters resolving their emotional problems.  The alternate timeline allows the viewers to see the main characters in lives without the influence of Jacob and the Island.  They have a better, although not great, emotional state of mind and perspective on life.  They are shown without the severe emotional baggage that they carried the first 5 seasons.<br /><br />The spiritual ending.  The way the series ends is sad and happy at the same time.  Great work to evoke both emotions.  The characters are presented as having resolved the major psychological issues and worked out most of their interpersonal issues with the other characters in the series and collectively are able to move on to the Hereafter.<br /><br />The smoke monster and jacob are explained.  Not opposites, or ying and yang, God and Satan, or good and evil, but are revealed as humans with human issues, idiosyncrasies, and issues.<br /><br />Richard's past and his relationship with Jacob is explained.<br /><br />The Numbers are explained (partially).  It turns out that the 6 magical Numbers are just a subset of 108 numbers which represent the 108 candidates that Jacob has been pursuing for many years looking for the perfect replacement for himself.  Nothing more mysterious than that.<br /><br />For those viewers who enjoyed the Religious connections to the Old Testament and other Religious works in seasons 1-5, the final church scene is very satisfying both emotionally and spiritually.  It will support and reinforce your belief that life after death is possible.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />The majority of the mysteries from Seasons 1-5 are not revealed as committed they would be  by the producers.  The series continually introduced new and interesting events and circumstances throughout the first 5 seasons and into the 6th and very few were addressed in season 6 other than those in the Good section above.  Hundreds of examples from Walt to Dharma to Numbers to Claire to the three toed statue to time travel to pendalum to Eloise to Lighthouse to Widmore and many many other examples of the mysteries introduced during the years of Lost.  Almost all were left up to each individual having to make their own assumptions about what it all meant and if they were relevant or irrelevant.<br /><br />Richard, the mysterious character that was in most episodes of Lost, is revealed to be just a follower with no real insight into what has been happening on the Island and turns out to be irrelevant in the big picture.<br /><br />The Island itself, Lost's Main Character, was revealed to be nothing more than essentially a magical floating toilet bowl filled with golden liquid that if flushed into the Pacific Ocean the world would be destroyed.  After many years of weaving this main character into the fabric of Lost and then have such an inane conclusion as to what it was, is a serious flaw.<br /><br />In general, very poor writing and wandering plot gave season 6 the worst feel of the entire series and for the entire season there were only 3 or 4 really good episodes that were tightly written and didn't feel like the season was just being extended to fill up time.<br /><br />The Alternate Timeline didn't really provide much to Lost except to provide the Love Boat background for a few of the characters to kiss and come together and provide the church for the final religious scene.  Other than that, it was a waste of time.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />The ending is very simplistic and clich&eacute;.  It turns out to be nothing more than the classic and typical religious experience of Seeing the Light and moving into the Hereafter all played out in a Church.  Nothing imagintive or innovative.<br /><br />The ending revealed the entire series was mainly an excursion into the Bibical Old Testament stories, updated to the modern world for the sake of protraying good vs evil in the context of human frailities.<br /><br />The ending provided no logical conclusion to the ingenious Plot that was the mainstay of Lost.  The conclusion left the viewer with only one way to appreciate the complete series;  to treat the more than 100 characters that were killed and murdered during the series as irrelevant, to treat the mysterious and numerous events as improbable and irrelevant and focus only on the remaining few characters as the only reason and purpose for the entire 6 years.  Thus, the rationale Lost was always just a story about the characters.<br /><br />With the final episode, it is now obvious that the creaters of Lost did it as a religious personal opinion piece.  It was done to show viewers that there a Hereafter exists and that if one loves correctly and redeems themselves they have an opportunity for an Afterlife.<br /><br />For those viewers who believed Lost was intelligent, logical and though provoking, Season 6 is the anthitsis of what was expected from what they had believed was a sophisticed and intellectually complex series.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though Season 6 had some good elements, the bad and ugly far outweigh the experience.  Not only does Season 6 on it's own turn out to be the weakest and worst of all six seasons, the conclusion invalidated and corrupted the previous 5 seasons.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br /><br />If you enjoyed the Religious context of Lost and believe that the show is really a story about the Characters that get to the end, then buy Season 6.  Watch it and join in the emotional and spiritual final scene.  But, be aware you are likely to shed a tear or two so keep the hankies handy.<br /><br />However, if you believed that Lost was an intellectually complex story with significant thought provoking elements,  Do not bother purchasing or viewing Season 6.  Buy and watch Seasons 1-5 watch and re-watch over an over again and pretend that the show was cancelled after Season 5.  Especially since season 6 left the majority of the entire Lost plot and events of the first 5 seasons up to your own interpretation anyway, your entire Lost experience shouldn't have to burdened with inept Season 6.s of weaving this main character into the fabric of Lost and then have such an inane conclusion as to what it was, is a serious flaw.    In general, very poor writing and wandering plot gave season 6 the worst feel of the entire series and for the entire season there were only 3 or 4 really good episodes that were tightly written and didn't feel like the season was just being extended to fill up time.

Not only does Season 6 on it's own turn out to be the weakest and worst of all six seasons, the conclusion invalidated and corrupted the previous 5 seasons.        Recommendation:    If you enjoyed the Religious context of Lost and believe that the show is really a story about the Characters that get to the end, then buy Season 6.   Watch it and join in the emotional and spiritual final scene.  But, be aware you are likely to shed a tear or two so keep the hankies handy.    However, if you believed that Lost was an intellectually complex story with significant thought provoking elements,  Do not bother purchasing or viewing Season 6.   Buy and watch Seasons 1-5 watch and re-watch over an over again and pretend that the show was cancelled after Season 5.  Especially since season 6 left the majority of the entire Lost plot and events of the first 5 seasons up to your own interpretation anyway, your entire Lost experience shouldn't have to burdened with inept Season 6.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|I've read alot of people not liking the picture in Blu-Ray but I have no idea what they are talking about. All the colors and clarity are there. It's even standard AND extended version as it gives you a choice of which one you want to watch. Not much more to say about it. The movie itself is great as we all know and now the blu-ray made it better. I watch it on my Panasonic player with the Samsung 40in.1080P LCD TV and the picture just pops out at me. So 5 stars here.
B003HLM2QO|2.0|Why would one want to get rid of the one true metal guitar hero left today? Cause his albums were starting to sound to much like BLS? Come on Ozzy Zakk originated his sound in your band. That being said this album is not nearly as hard as it could have been and the lead work is o.k at best. He's no Rhoads, Lee, or Wylde and I think Ozzy was dumb to be so jealous of the side kick that has carried him threw out these last years. Hope they stick to this album and he doesn't  try to play Zakks stuff live cause it will never fly. terribly dissapointed in Ozzy.
B00383YC2S|3.0|I don't know that she necessarily has to go back to Mylene Farmer but she needs to find someone that can help her put together some better material to show off her talents. This album can only be labeled \\"electronic\\" because every track is backed by poorly produced and written music performed on a Casio keyboard. While the lyrics are decent and singing is good, the production makes me almost wish she'd do more covers of top 40 hits. Please understand that I'm fine with simple musical accompaniment as long as it's good. La Roux? Annie? Matt & Kim? Despite the lazy production, Alizee has a beautiful delivery and presence as always on this album. I especially liked the atmosphere of Mes fantomes.     The best I think I can hope for is that because Alizee's voice is so prominent over the music in the album perhaps some inspired electronic musicians will remix some of the tracks. I'll probably always buy her albums but this one probably won't last long in the stereo rotation unless a remix version comes out.    I wish I could give 2.5 stars. As a fan of her music I'll be kind and give her 3/5.
1597801577|4.0|I am not really a fan of science fiction literature (I have a soft spot for Ray Bradbury, but that's where it ends), and I still have NO clue what steampunk is, but I know a good book when I read it. Although dropping into a completely unfamiliar setting, with names I cant pronounce in a country I know little about (my American is showing, sorry) makes the story a bit slow-going and confusing to start, but give it a chapter or so.<br />I snuck to read this under the table, while out to dinner with friends, because I simply couldn't wait to finish. It's worth your time, pick it up, read it and get sucked in.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|The video quality of this blu-ray is absolutely superb. It has always been one of my favourite films and I consider it superior to \\"Goodfellas\\". De Niro and Stone are better than ever. What an incredible performance! This blu-ray is region free and is dubbed in Castilian Spanish. A must-buy.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|to take this CD out of the player. Cyndi was pretty cute back in the day, but her genre wasn't very interesting to me. Now that she's matured into a Hot Blues Mama, she's welcome in my CD player any time! It's been several years since I found a CD I could listen to over and over, and it's very satisfying to have found Cyndi's. I'll probably need to rack up a lot of solo driving hours to be able to sing along with the whole thing <grin> since her vocalizations are so complex and wonderful. Big hugs to the little lady.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|I'm a die-hard LOST fan. I just couldn't believe how good the video quality of this blu-ray is. I had the feeling, in many scenes, that LOST was a 3D feature. Absolutely recommended and two important notices: although the blu ray box and amazon claim that this product is Region A locked, it can also be played, without any problem, in region B blu ray players and is dubbed in castilian spanish. The same can be said about Seasons One and Five. However europpean customers should know that Seasons Three and Four will not run on their blu ray players. A must buy absolutely recommended.

0780622650|3.0|Like \\"I Hate Valentine's Day\\" before it, I have to make another ratings dispute.  Why is \\"Lost is Space\\" rated PG-13 when this about as family-friendly PG as it can get?  Alright, so the monsters in this movie gets splattered with blue goo, but I doubt the kids would bat an eyes over blueberry gunk; in fact, if the monsters bleed green goo, this would be a Nickelodeon movie.  The characters do curse the 's' word (though I don't see why that's necessary), but only twice and it's not as much as that in \\"Warriors of Virtue\\".  Finally, there's not much in way of intense violence either.  Most of the film is productively child-oriented, from having the ugly badly-CGI alien existing to be a 'cute' mascot, Will Robinson taking plenty of screen time to do rascally scientific things and controlling a robot during videogame-like sequence, and Penny Robinson sounds like she's in a Chip & Dale cartoon.  Given these elements and how apparently campy the original TV series was, I find this movie pretentious in trying to be edgy.<br /><br />\\"Lost In Space\\" is a lackluster adaptation with many discernible flaws.  Thanks to William Hurt and Matt LeBlanc, they deliver one of the most monotonous performances ever in films.  The vanilla romantic plot between LeBlanc and Heather Graham was hammy and forced, given the obnoxious smug nature of LeBlanc and dopey predictable attitude from Graham.  The special effects didn't age well over the years; although the background shots were nice, the monsters looked so badly-done and the flashy filter effects stood out too much. Whatever tension it has, it was superficial, which didn't help by the fact that the characters constantly spout one-liners. Finally, there was a time-travel plot that's cluttered by its own set-up and convenient by its own execution.<br /><br />However, for being a soulless, manufactured blockbuster, I'm not berating it too much.  Outside the weird time-travel plot, the story is straightforward and harmless (and by harmless, I mean the movie didn't make me want to cause harm to others).  The film is what it set out to be, a cash grab; at least it's a watchable one.ovie didn't make me want to cause harm to others).

B003KUSUG8|5.0|Anybody who says this cd isn't good is either def or retarded because this is strait fire.No comparision between this and Relapse.Relapse lacked songs with true meaning and it was stupid and silly for most of the album.If you are a person who really likes songs with deep meanings then you should love this one.
B00001OH7U|5.0|I sold about 600 of my vinyl records last year to save space, but this record (and other Bowie albums) is one I wish I'd hadn't parted with. I'm going to get the MP3 album here. This is a gem in my opinion. Bowie is THE MAN. This is definitely a keeper. He was, IMHO, at his best in the 70s.

B00005LMBK|5.0|For starters, I have to say, even though Demon Days and Plastic Beach were amazing, Gorillaz, the world's most successful virtual band's debut, was their best. With it's silly and interesting story, great instruments, completely original directions, and thought demanding, not just provoking, lyrics, it takes the listener by surprise, even if said listener has already heard all their other stuff. Plus, the enhanced CD version, which I have, has just fun and hilarious bonuses. This band is one of the three rap artists I honestly like. The other two are Eminem and Snoop Dog, just in case you care. I'm more of a metal person.    Anyway, to wrap up, if you are considering buying this masterpiece, I must honestly say, GO FOR IT! You will love it, or I will give you a million dollars!
0061537969|5.0|This book is amazing!  It completely captivated me and I almost finished it in one sitting - except that I needed to get a few hours of sleep - otherwise, I would have read it straight through.  It's one of those books that just touches you in such a profound way, and stays with you.  It really makes you take a look at your life and re-evaluate your priorities and embrace the things that matter and forget about all the other stuff.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of the family dog, Enzo.  It begins on the last night of his life and Enzo narrates the story of his relationship with his owner, Denny Swift, and the eventual formation of his family.  Denny marries Eve and they have a daughter named Zoe.  The story that follows consists of illness, death, custody battles, love, and undying perseverance - and is both heartbreaking and inspirational and I dare you to finish this book with dry eyes.  Yes - the book is sad in parts, but it's so much more - it's not a tragic tale, but instead a story of faith, endurance, determination, and strength.<br /><br />If you like race cars, you will love this book.  If you're an animal lover, you will love this book.  If you've ever thought that your dog understands more they get credit for, you will REALLY love this book.  And if you're not an animal lover or a fan of race cars - you will still love this book - it's just that good!  I can't say enough or give enough praise for this story.  Enzo has stolen a piece of my heart and the life lessons he has taught will resonate with me always!
0374105235|5.0|needed the book for English class.  glad it was a required reading. this book is an easy enjoyable read. recounts a life of his own childhood growing up in a war torn country and how he tried to survive. first trying to stay out of the war and finally left to join the war just to stay alive. and more....  MUST READ.  lots of syballism.

B002TVQ4HG|3.0|Let's say you could live your life over again, would you change anything knowing the outcome is going to be a disaster? You would, but who would watch the movie?<br /><br />This movie plays on a theme used in \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes and various movies since the 1950's: Where the person sees themselves and integrates their present action to duplicate what has happened in the past. While it was done well in this movie, it didn't stand out as compared to others.<br /><br />Did anyone else notice that Melissa George got augmentations after the movie to pose for the cover? The movie drops the F-bomb a few times, but is not bogged down with swearing. It has killing and blood, but spares us gore.
0143038419|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Some of the negative reviews I've read, and some of the discussions I've had with friends all centered around the fact that they think Liz Gilbert is just way too self centered and didn't like that she didn't explain her divorce. First of all its a journey of self discovery, that pretty much tells you right away \\"hey this author, shes going to talk about herself a lot, if you can't deal with that, walk away now!\\" of course she's self centered, it's HER journey of SELF discovery. I think she has every right to be. As far as not explaining her divorce, I don't think she had to, she wasn't happy, bottom line. So she did something about it, why does she have to dive into details?<br />Anyway I thought this book was amazing, it was fun, inspiring and a great escape from normal life. Ms. Gilbert is a little hard to relate to, since she gets to travel the world with not a care or responsibility, so you will get jealous of her situation every once in a while, but get it over it, she got lucky, don't be bitter, be happy for her, and hopefully she'll inspire you to find your own happiness along the way.
B000FC13MM|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school and have re-read it almost annually ever since. Nix creates a wonderful and fully realized world with interesting cultural details. I loved his slant on magic and the rings of death that sabriel has to travel. The explainations of the different bells that Sabriel uses to control and dispell the dead is so wonderful.<br />It really feels like you are stepping into another world. And the main character Sabriel is immediatly likeable. She is funny, smart, and determined. She isn't one of those chaaracter that whines and sulks (which is refreshing).<br /><br />But even better than this book is the triology occupying the same world. It follows the character Lirael, who is an intoverted mysfit with a talking dog companion and a fight against an ancient evil that no one saw coming.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I had pre-ordered the DVD for $41.99 which I thought was quite high. I cancelled it today after checking other  shows prices. The Closer for 15 episodes is $25.99, NCIS is $37.04 for 25 episodes. While I love White Collar,  the price is way to high for 15 episodes.
1592402690|5.0|This book is a treasure-trove for anyone interested in music...whether it be recording music, playing music, or producing it, this book delves into the many aspects of recording and album. Geoff Emerick helped engineer and record the most famous album in rock history: Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He was there in the recording booth for many of the Beatles most famous albums.<br /><br />Not only do you get to hear some great anecdotes, you get to read how some of the most famous albums in history were recorded. For people interested in recording music, I'd say that this book is a must have...it talks about mic placement and many techniques on how to get a certain sound. Sure, these albums were recorded about 50 years ago, but many of the techniques Emerick writes about still apply today.<br /><br />Most of the book takes place in the studio, so it is not really a bio on the Beatles spanning their whole career...it is a bio about the times the Beatles were in the studio. From the Beatles first recording to the recording of 'Strawberry Fields Forever' to the last page, I was glued to this book.<br /><br />In the end, I think it is a great read for anyone interested in the Beatles and/or interested in music itself.<br /><br />5/5
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I just finished reading this on the Kindle.  I really wanted to read it after a co-worker told me about it.  She said it was about this woman that travels all over the world - something that I am NOT really known for.  I am glad I read it though.  The breakdown of the book is really good and many of her descriptions are beautiful, especially when she describes a culture you don't know about.  There are certain points in the book where you stop and really wish that you finished the book already...but in the end it really becomes an enlightening experience.    Some spoilers...    Liz goes to Italy and really just throws herself head first in the food and is pretty content, without even meditating on her past.  This dragged towards the end.  Then she goes to India and it is all about meditating.  With this part of the book, you really get to see her move past some of her sorrows of the past and it is really beautiful.  Her last trip to Indonesia is probably the best part because it really is a balance of both worlds (Italy and India) and the characters are really interesting.  She is still meditating and seeing a medicine man, but she does take a lover and is finally happy.    I would definitely recommend this book even if it sometimes is a sort of struggle finishing because there is really a good message in the end.  After reading this, I sort of do want to start traveling! =)
B001CDLATE|5.0|This is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. It's a non-verbal travel log. Not to sound snobish, but you must see the blue-ray. You will not believe that your TV is capable of producing that much resolution. Certainly a fabulous demo disc.
0525423842|5.0|Some of the reviews here boggle the mind. What were you expecting from a YA book about the justice system and a murder trial? I thought the book was wonderful and I read it before my 14 and 11 year-olds, who both felt the same way. It introduced them to the legal system in a way that they could easily appreciate and digest and kept their attention from chapter to chapter. This is not necessarily a book for those who love Grisham's heavier legal thrillers, but didn't you know before picking it up it was aimed squarely at the YA market? And if not, how the heck could you miss that?<br /><br />The lead is identifiable and engaging. Sure he's highly usual, but that's point. So were Nancy Drew and Encyclopedia Brown. If you don't root for him, you're probably reading the wrong genre.<br /><br />I was surprised at how the plot and fun bits of humor kept the pages turning, and that's the point for kids who desperately need more reasons to read. Bravo to Grisham for writing a book that entertained and educated more than 99% of the YA titles on shelves.
0060574216|2.0|Mars/Venus has some good material that is repeated so many times that the book is not enjoyable to read.  Also loses points for including a \\"blame-it-on-your-repressed-childhood\\" section.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I have enjoyed Mr. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series for quite a long time. I have read and re-read all of the books many times, and they never get old.<br /><br />Now I have all of the books in paperback, but I decided to get the Kindle version for my iPhone library. As much as I love the books I couldn't help but be annoyed. It seems that the Kindle version wasn't proof-read or spell-checked at all. There are so many spelling mistakes in it that my eyes glazed over at points. not just a few mistakes, but as many as two or three every few pages. For example, I am about 3/4 or so through the book and I have only seen the country of Dorne spelled correctly once. Every other time it is for some reason spelled Dome. There are numerous times when in one sentence a character's name is spelled correctly, and two sentences later the name is misspelled. There's also randomly inserted punctuations like brackets where there shouldn't be, and some punctuation is missing or wrong (A missing ' in a contraction or a ! in place of a ?). Also for some reason there are some words that are italic that should not be...<br /><br />I downloaded both Game of Thrones and it's sequel, A Clash of Kings. I really hope Clash isn't as bad. I still enjoyed the Game of Thrones Kindle version due to it's convenience and what-not but the constant mistakes do get fairly annoying.<br /><br />Thats just my take on the Kindle eBook aspect of this.<br /><br />The book itself is spectacular. If you are looking for a Tolkien-esque fantasy then you are looking in the wrong place. The pure evil in this world is pretty much just  a whisper from the north. An after-thought to the main points of the story. This is a gritty, no holds barred tale of medieval life. Rape and violence, death and betrayal.<br /><br />Younger readers and people looking for the standard feel good, pure good versus pure evil fantasy trash will not like this series. This is a much more realistic world set in a medieval-like time period, not a pretty story with perfect-featured elves and a bad guy intent on destroying the world even though he is living in said world. There is no little piece of gold jewelry that needs to be destroyed to save the world. If a character you care about in the series dies he will not be coming back. A main character will not take one lesson at swordplay and suddenly be a master swordsman. Nor will he gain an undefeatable magic power.<br /><br />One thing to note as well is Mr. Martin's writing style in these books. he doesnt just focus on one or three character's point of view. Each chapter in these books is told from the point of view of a different character. One chapter will be from the point of view of John Snow, then next will by Tyrion Lannister, then Arya Stark, then back again to John Snow. Some people may not like it, annoyed that the eyes they are looking (reading) from changes so constantly. Personally I like it. You get to know all of these character's more and more. You see from their eyes instead of them being just a name viewed by the main character.<br /><br />A warning, there are 4 books in the series, the 5th coming out relatively soon (we all hope) but George has said that he will NOT release a book unless he is satisfied with it. Deadlines do not matter in the face of quality, and if the book is not up to snuff he will not release it until it is. Supposedly there will be 7 books total. There have been some long waits in between the books already out so do not expect the next volumes to be coming out annually, or even bi-annually. They will come out when they come out.featured elves and a bad guy intent on destroying the world even though he is living in said world.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|I've listened to this album quite a few times now. My first impressions:<br /><br />Besides the first song, Eminem has greatly matured. His main focuses are no longer on drugs or killing his mother, rather, he mostly raps about lost love and recovering from drugs and bad albums. The production is spectacular on this album: there are so many elements used: from synths to piano to acoustic guitars...One thing I found amazing was the use of acoustic guitar in many of the songs...'Space Bound', 'Love the Way You Lie', and others use acoustic guitar and it sounds great. Rap isn't all about a beat...it is about mood and that mood can be captured in so many instruments...Em realized this and used it to his advantage.<br /><br />There are three major standouts on this album (for me at least): 'Space Bound', 'I'm Not Afraid', 'Love The Way You Lie'.<br /><br />'Space Bound' is probably the best rap song I've ever heard. From the imagery intense chorus to the tapestry of words Eminem lays out in the verses, 'Space Bound' is Eminem at true recovery. 'I'm Not Afraid' is Em's rap about getting back out there in the music world. 'Love The Way You Lie' is just amazing...Rihanna's chorus and em's verse make this song one of my favorites.<br /><br />Many other songs are just as powerful: 25 to Life, No Love, Going Through Changes, On Fire, You're Never Over.<br /><br />Eminem has definitely matured. This album is a sign that he has moved on from glorifying drugs and killing...it seems as if he is now focused on the real world.<br /><br />5/5
B001MEJY8W|5.0|There's something to be said for foreign horror films. They are usually WAY better than American films. American horror is just plain blah. I think the only thing scary is how terrible it is. (half of 'our' movies are terrible remakes of foreign films anyway). That being said, like the title says - I'm not going to give a play by play of the plot and scenes and all that (don't you hate when people do that? way to ruin the film, right?).      What makes this movie so fantastic is not only the visual gore (which is pretty wild), but it's perfect blend of psychological terror - both within oneself and of others - amazing cinematography, a pretty excellent soundtrack, and of course, the acting (primarily the two main characters - both of whom are pretty smokin', in my opinion).    -If you're looking for simple mindless slasher pic, or you've got a weak stomach and you're skittish, don't watch this.     -If you've got a brain and you're tired of the bland and predictable (and boring, really) \\"horror\\" films, please DO watch this! It will definitely keep you riveted. I think I may have blinked twice and took maybe one breath. It's solid, dark, and certainly a film that will keep you thinking, long after the movie is over.    Well... I hope this helped any of the potential viewers, and um... enjoy! hah
0783228007|4.0|Ever since I interviewed Clint Eastwood in the late sixties, I've been a huge fan of his. It was fun watching him go from the very hunky Rowdy Yates on TV's \\"Rawhide\\" to a tough cowboy in \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" to Dirty Harry and then into directing and producing his own blockbusters! What a ride he has given the world...and what a creative genius!    That said, when I interviewed him he was just starting negotiations with [[ASIN:0783228007 Joe Kidd]]...but it's one film I missed...until it came on TV the other night. I gave it a go and I liked it. Clint was not at his best in this film and the film was not the best cinematic effort either. That didn't stop me from enjoying his good looks or watching him practice that trademark snarl... lol    I thought the startling, unrealistic scene where he drove a locomotive into the hotel/bar where Robert Duvall was hiding was hilarious and as good an ending as any for this rather bad movie. It's reported that he said: \\"Jesus, anything at this point--let's end it.\\"    Typical Eastwood; sounds just like him. Gotta love him...    Endnote: I never thought I'd give anything Eastwood does (or did) less than five stars, but I am giving this a generous four...just because it's him!

B0039SFKSW|5.0|There is no way around it; these guys still produce music that is absolutely addictive.  As skilled craftsman, they are virtually in a league of their own.  The album elevates itself to the proficiency and beauty of Phoenix, but takes on hints of spiritualism and convictions similar to stuff you've heard from Yes.  The roots of the band remain intact, but ever evolved, as well.  Comparatively, I would say that Phoenix was a better overall album, but this is still great stuff.  The musical range of these guys is tremendous.  If you love the art of exceptionally skilled musicians who make exceptionally great albums, even if they are getting a little older, then this is a must have album.
B003K025V4|4.0|Well, she is growing up (and has been for the last few years). Disney really ought to stop milking the Hannah Montana franchise and let her move on to being just Miley. Let her make an episode where she goes off to college and end the series. There are always new kids to make famous and to be role models for little girls and little boys aged 6 to 14, but Miley is beyond that now. Her last two albums and this one prove that. While much of it is over produced \\"dance music\\" along the lines of Christina Aquilera and countless other female pop singers, Miley still has an instantly recognizable voice. I'm older than most fans I'm sure and only listen to her music because the kids of some of the girls I date do, and it is a guilty pleasure to listen and turn up a few tracks in the car and remember what it was like to be 18.     Hopefully if she spends a few years away from pop music soon after touring to support this album, she can reinvent herself. It will be interesting to see what she comes back as. Perhaps she will get into acting in a more serious way. Or perhaps come back as more of a less \\"dance music\\" oriented singer (not that there is anything wrong with that, as it is a music niche to be filled), but she obviously has the pipes to get around a song - any song - and do it justice.     Good luck to her and I hope she doesn't go off the deep in as the hormones kick in, and that she doesn't become another Britney Spears or Paris Hilton, known more for being slutty and famous than for doing anything of real note.
031606792X|2.0|Spoiler alert!: The book was quite disappointing. I find these books lack action and wow the ending was HORRIBLE! The author was clearly afraid of killing off some of the beloved Cullens. It was ridiculous. There was the HUGE hype of the Volturi coming to kill them all over Bella's half human, half vampire child, and nothing happened! It was a ridiculous, fairytale ending. I was very disappointed. A whole lot of nothing really happened except for Bella vomiting blood.
B002UJIY7A|4.0|Something needs to be said right away- there is a major, drastic SEVERE difference in quality between the first half of a Perfect Getaway and the second half.  In fact, the last 30 minutes completely *save* what could have quite possibly been a 1-star overall rating.  I was seriously ready to give it 1 disappointing little star here on amazon!      Had that *extremely gigantic* storyline twist not taken place during the second half, I would have gladly tossed this film to the wayside.    That twist... that glorious, wonderful twist!  It completely changed the quality of the storyline.  Without that twist this film would have been a major disappointment, no doubt about it.    The storyline is simple- there's some killers loose in a tropical forest/island.  I'll just leave it at that so I don't spoil anything by mistake!    Despite the final 30 minutes of writing being near brilliant and totally surprising, it does NOT make up for the inexcusably bland first half of storytelling that has *zero* atmosphere or suspense.  Just one forgettable scene after another.    I recommend a Perfect Getaway for anyone looking for some major storyline twists in the action/suspense department.
B0036EH3XE|2.0|MAGIC!!!! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!<br /><br />Seriously, though. That's pretty much the solution they gave us after 6 years, as if we couldn't figure out the Island was magical after Locke starts walking in the first season. During the course of the show we see the Island has healing powers, time travel powers, and can grant eternal life, and then in the 6th season the writers revealed the source of the Island's powers was a magic glowing light, as if everyone was just going to go \\"OOOHHHHHHHH, So THAT'S what it was! The Island was MAGIC!\\" and suddenly feel completely satisfied. I did give the final season two starts because, despite the lack of closure on the Island, they did give complete closure on the characters, and after watching the series for 6 seasons you do become invested in their outcome, but not so much that any rational person would actually get on Amazon and post a review that says \\"You know what? They gave us complete closure on the characters, and in the end, isn't that what we all really wanted to know anyway?\\" NO! Obviously it was not. If that were the case, everyone would have been praising the ending instead of panning it. To be perfectly honest, the decision to focus on the characters in the last season and reveal almost nothing new about the Island was a completely arrogant move on the writers' part. As if they thought they were such AMAZING writers, that they could deliver us one fantastic finale that sums up what happens to Jack so well, we wouldn't even care what the story was with that Island, because we would be so floored with how great they are at writing, we wouldn't even notice they didn't conclude the REAL plot line that made us all start watching in the first place. The Island. Did they really think I was going to be sitting at home thinking, \\"Finally! After six years I get to find out what's going on with this Islan...Oh WHAT? THAT'S what happens to Jack?!?! No Way!!! Awesome! Why did I start watching this show again?\\"<br /><br />I have heard some theories that claim the writer's actually do have a well thought out explanation for what the Island really is, besides Magic, but for one excellent reason or another they couldn't squeeze it into the finale. If that's true I'll consider changing my rating, but until then, they get TWO stars. Bummer.heard some theories that claim the writer's actually do have a well thought out explanation for what the Island really is, besides Magic, but for one excellent reason or another they couldn't squeeze it into the finale.

B0029LJ96E|5.0|A few months ago I published an Amazon review for an older CD release of this album. What I wanted to review was this, the LP print by Cadet Concepts. It is a far richer cut of the album then the CD cut that I reviewed. It hasn't been reworked it is just a fresh sounding copy.<br /><br />The back story quickly is that Muddy recorded this album with a psychedelic stoner band in the late sixties. Purists hate it and supposedly Mud himself hated the album as well. I personally think it is a tight blend of psychedelic grooves in their prime... not drifting too far away from the bluesy roots or sometime hip-funk beats that would make it uneven with the Muds singing. The weakest track in the mix is probably the STones cover, but even that has its charm. The ones that cook with the most steam are SHES ALL RIGHT, a nice extender with a brief My Girl fade out by the band and HERBERT HARPERS FREE PRESS which flows free and nice into TOM CAT. SAME THING sort of sounds like the \\"same thing\\" as a tune called \\"spoon full\\" but the band holds the loose ends together whenever needed, they are tight, I wonder if they are around on anything else? As far as I know the Mud never collaborated with the band again, but Howlin Wolf I think did about a year later, and the rumor is that he hated the whole project as well. I hope its as cool as this bit.<br /><br />BUT, if you can spin vinyl in your home, avoid the CD entirely, and try to grab up this Cadet Concepts pressing. Looks rare on Amazon, but available under the table. I found it on the rack at Newbury Comics myself, for eleven bucks. It was a nice grab!
B002BFBAWO|4.0|It's a rare movie that mixes references to literary and philosophical favorites like Trotsky, Gogol and Melville with repeated punches to the crotch of its protagonist, but these opposing poles manage to mark \\"Adventureland\\" as an ideal comedy for the more intellectually inclined viewers out there.  Taking viewers all the way back to 1987, writer-director Greg Mottola's semi-autobiographical comedy doesn't exactly boast a great deal of narrative drive, but its relaxed pace is perfectly suited to its highly personal storytelling.  It would be a mistake to describe the movie's overall tone as nostalgic, but it does provide a wistful and relatable take on the period in life when aspirations tend to collide with reality, along with the expected (yet still amusing) nods to 80's style and pop culture.  The formula is somewhat similar to that used in Mottola's previous effort, \\"Superbad\\"--barrages of profanity, sex jokes, and youthful debauchery mixed with occasional doses of sentiment and self-realization--although this time out the balance is tilted noticeably more toward the latter elements.  Where many mainstream comedies seem desparate to get a laugh out of their audience, \\"Adventureland\\" is content to let the humor rise naturally from the interactions of the characters and smartly-written dialogue loaded with sarcasm, intellectual references, and big words.<br /><br />\\"Adventureland\\" centers around the plight of James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg), a sensitive recent college graduate who's just found out that his parents' finances won't accomodate either his planned trip to Europe or his graduate-school goals. James is marked early on as the type of idealistic dreamer who allows himself to fall for a girl he's been dating for a week and a half, reads poetry for pleasure, and aspires to write Dickens-styled travelogues exposing the state of the world around him (on a personal note, as something of an overeducated, underemployed pseudo-intellectual type myself, I was certainly able to empathize with James's situation as he tries to find his way in a world that has little use for his extensive knowledge of comparative literature and Renaissance studies).  Since James's education didn't provide him with too many marketable skils--he laments early on that he's even unqualified for manual labor--he's forced to take a decidedly menial position working the game stations at Adventureland, a dreary amusement park in suburban Pittsburgh run by an overly enthusiastic husband-and-wife team (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, who bring their usual hilarity to relatively minor roles).  At the park, James finds himself surrounded mainly by a pack of doomed souls with little or no prospects, chiefly focused on getting through the day so they can numb at least a little of their pain with booze, weed, and sex.<br /><br />Shortly after embarking on his job at Adventureland, James begins a tentative romance with his vaguely dark and troubled coworker Em (Kristen Stewart, aka the chick from the \\"Twilight\\" movies), who also happens to be carrying on a secret affair with Connell (Ryan Reynolds), a married wannabe musician making ends meet as the park's handyman.  Not surprisingly, some life lessons ensue, but they're laced with enough humor and a light enough touch to differentiate \\"Adventureland\\" from the mass of coming-of-age flicks out there.  It helps that the movie places an emphasis throughout on creating believable and multi-dimensional characters, as Mottola shows a clear affection (or at least sympathy) for most of the cast without idealizing them or minimizing their flaws.  Even Reynold's Connell, who routinely cheats on his wife and blatantly lies about his musical exploits, is presented less as a villain than as just another working stiff doing whatever he can to make his life tolerable. Likewise, James's Russian literature-loving friend Joel (Martin Starr) is portrayed as part endearing nerd and part aimless, pretentious slacker.<br /><br />Like most great comedies, \\"Adventureland\\" succeeds because it gets the little things right, perfectly capturing both the myriad tiny indignities that come with dead-end service-industry jobs and the attempts that people in them make to transcend their seemingly dire circumstances.  The minimalistic, occasionally haunting score by Yo La Tengo is nicely complemented by a selection of period music both great (the Replacements make a couple of appearances, including a memorable use of \\"Bastards of Young\\" in the opening scene) and not so great (the constant playings of Falco's \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\" are used to further underscore the horrors faced by the park employees).  \\"Adventureland\\" definitely isn't the most ambitious movie ever made, but it draws viewers into its characters and their little world so well that it doesn't have to be.  Those familiar with the work of Judd Apatow and his collaborators (several of whom show up in supporting roles) would be well-served to check this movie out.ventureland\\" succeeds because it gets the little things right, perfectly capturing both the myriad tiny indignities that come with dead-end service-industry jobs and the attempts that people in them make to transcend their seemingly dire circumstances.

B003HLM2QO|4.0|Is this the best OZZY album since No More Tears? Difficult to award it five stars at the moment since I've only been listening to it for four days but I can say that most of these new songs are stunning, the VOICE sounds great, always been a fan of Gus G. who is Zak Wlyde's replacement in the band -brilliantly heavy and melodic. There are some really cool sounds here - different more modern sounds mixed with the usual typical Ozzy metal and even some quieter acoustic moments. I'm sure this one is a real grower.<br /><br />Gus G rips all over this CD but I doubt he had much input into the songs. Some of the songs are not instant, which - to be frank - may be a good thing in the long run.<br /><br />I'm really enjoying the 'quieter' tracks on offer - 'Crucify', 'Time', 'Latimer's..' In fact I've got the 'Beatle-esque' 'Life won't wait..' stuck on 'replay' at the moment. Nice acoustic-ish intro, very emotive chorus and then those doomy 'Sabbath'-like chords just crash in.. top notch!<br /><br />To sum up - some nice sounds I haven't heard on an Ozzy album before. No Ozzy fan could have expected an album as classy as this. Love his words as usual. Simply put , here he sounds a million miles away from the bumbling 'Osbournes' on-the-verge-of senility image most probably still have of the man...or is it all just studio trickery ..?

At times humorous, often sad, but always very enlightening. I could see so many parallels to the struggle my own mother-in-law had with dementia.  Definitely a must read for anyone with a family member with memory problems. I couldn't put it down and consider it one of the best books I've ever read.
B0038Z5SEW|4.0|I picked up this Blu-ray the other day, and it is by far the best presentation of the movie I've ever seen.    However, there is a major problem when compared to the standard definition DVD.  At the very end of the Blu-ray version, immediately prior to the credits, the close-up of Anthony Hopkin's face fades to black prematurely. It robs the ending of some emotional resonance, since originally, the camera lingered on his sadness for a few seconds longer. Fans of the film might find it absolutely annoying since the final seconds of the Blu-ray's presentation definitely looks more awkward.
032147404X|1.0|Don't waste your money. Scott's writing is offensive. Basically, he uses this book as an opportunity to express his very poor sense of humor. His shooting suggestions are trivial and familiar. He holds himself and other so-called \\"pros\\" in high regard. His writing  is very poor and just a lot of fluff and personal opinion, basically nonsense. Also, there is a lot of advertising. Frankly, I am surpised this book got published. My advice is to save your money. Don't spend it on this book!

It's an album  worth listening to from start to finish, which is what's missing from a lot of today's music.  Give it a chance, it's a good album, just different from their first two.  Peace

Fantastic movie, brilliant, so where do I find quality movies like these nowadays? Haha....

If you are a musician or have deep pockets and don't care about the cost...by all means spend hundreds for a pro lav. For my purpose, which is primarily for interviews it is just fine. I haven't had it long and I hope that it holds up well, but the sound is good.

1601251505|5.0|For those who never played Dungeons and Dragons 3.5, Pathfinder is an update of those rules. Those rules are now out-of-print so Pathfinder is carrying it all forward but with some needed improvements. For those who have never played 3.5 and don't have those books - please give Pathfinder a try. It is a great game in its own right. The rest of this review, however, is from the point of view of someone who really liked the 3.5 version of D&D and invested a lot of money in that system. I am very grateful that Paizon published Pathfinder to keep such a great gaming system going by improving but not radically overthrowing the system and continuing to support it with new publications and a great online community at [...].<br /><br />I've been playing D&D and other rpg's since the late 70's when I was in jr. high. I am happy to say that rpgs (role playing games) have grown and matured as I have. There was a big gap during the 90's when I didn't play at all, but when D&D 3.5 came out I was delighted because I really liked how they streamlined the rule systems to a single d20 roll to beat a single number (the difficulty factor). That made a lot more sense than rolling a d6 here or a d% here, trying to roll under a number here or over a set number there. I also liked how they streamlined the modifiers for the six basic attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) that are applied to different tasks, and how they streamlined the saving throw system. All in all, it was recognizably the same game I played since jr. high but with a coherent and streamlined rule system. I also really liked how characters had skill points they could buy so they could do things outside of combat. I was very happy that monsters were also given scores for the six abilities and had classes and even skills and were generally created using more or less the same system as the characters were. This was great because it made it easy to play certain monsters as characters and it made it easy for the game master to modify monsters to make them less generic, vary how challenging they were, and overall more than just things to kill. Subsequently I invested a lot of money on D&D 3.5 books. I only really got to play with my daughter however, a fun game but very different from hanging out with the guys. So I was a little dismayed when the 4th edition of D&D came out and WotC announced that they would no longer be publishing or supporting 3.5 materials. I felt kind of left high and dry.<br /><br />Then the clerks at the local game store told me that Paizo was coming out with a new game using an update of 3.5 rules that would be backwards compatible with my 3.5 library. I was intrigued and so when I found out about the free Beta Playtest Rules I downloaded them and started a play-by-post game with some friends about a year and a half ago (beginning of 2009). I ended up liking the Pathfinder system even more than 3.5 (granted its the same system but updated). It ironed out a lot of the rough spots in 3.5 (like Grappling rules), it beefed up the races and character classes, it streamlined the skill system in a way that made character creation (and NPC creation) easier, and the presentation (art, index, organization of the rules, etc...) even in the free Beta Playtest was impressive. When the final ruleset came out I bought two copies (one for home and one for my desk at work). We have had a great time over the past year and a half running a campaign set in the old D&D campaign world of Greyhawk and this rule system has wonderfully facilitated high adventure, drama, character development, and anything else I needed it to do. My fellow players even picked up their own copies of the rules when the hardback final rules came out.<br /><br />Are there errors and typos and such? No more than in other rulebooks of this size and a lot less than in many others - and the errata are available online anyway. Is this the perfect rule system? Depends on whatyou want. It is not as generic or complex as some (like GURPS) nor is it as simple and generic as other (Savage Worlds or perhaps 4th edition D&D though I've never played either). But for what it is it is great - a carrying forward of D&D 3.5 with high production values that is both backward compatible with older materials (with only minor tweaking of those materials required) and some great adventures and supplements continuing to be published in support of it. I think those who want a system that is both flexible and streamlined, and not too complex but not too abstract, will be very pleased with Pathfinder.<br /><br />Let me give an example of what it has enabled me to do. I have been able to take the game module Caverns of Thracia published for 3.5 (an update of an older module for 1st edition of D&D) and use it as the basis of our campaign using the Pathfinder rules. I have had to do only minor adjustments to the stats provided in that module. Why not use the 3.5 rulebooks I still had? Because again Pathfinder's updates make everything (like the skills and grappling rules) easier and the characters just a bit more interesting. Using the Pathfinder rules we have been able to have players run a member of the Scout class (from the 3.5 book Complete Adventurer), I've been able to use Ninja from that same book (pinch hitting for Scarlet Brotherhood assassins), and we've been able to have Doppelgangers and Lizardfolk as player characters (though here I must admit Pathfinder doesn't really have any developed rules for this and I've fallen back on rules from Savage Species and Races of Destiny - but again Pathfinder's rules are compatible enough that I can do this with only some minor changes and improvements of the 3.5 material. I've also been able to draw upon spells and options from other books like the Spell Compendium and the Book of Exalted Deeds and the Book of Vile Deeds and of course the \\"Races of\\" and \\"Complete\\" series of books and others.

I actually was considering give him only 4 stars because im not feeling some of the songs, but this is a GREAT COME BACK, so Congratulations EM!!

Johnson has evolved into a new performer it would appear and in my opinion, not for the better.  Sorry I needed to have to say this.  It won't keep me from listening to the earlier music, just not encourage me to purchase his next and have it sent, before I hear it first.  I feel I was burned on this one.  The recording even sounds weird.  Maybe it is just me.

B000001ELD|4.0|Gene's solo kiss disc was a strange one. It had songs that sounded like the beatles on it and even a disney song. It threw me for a loop back then as I was expecting blistering hard rock metal. But instead we got some good songs that only some sounded like kiss. It was a solo disc and if you aren't expecting kiss ala' 1977 then you can listen to this as a artist having some fun and making songs as he wanted to.  So in retrospect this is a good solo disc but if truth be told the next few years kiss lost it's way as they forget to give us the goods. Straight forward hard rock , they could have laid down a good pop disc like 'unmasked' and given us a hard rocker and we'd been more forgiving. That was the danger with this solo record. It was followed by 'dynasty' which is a great cd but it's was leaning toward a more pop attitude. Taken on it's own though this is a solo record and therefore is what it is. The best songs are in my opinion the more kiss like ones such as 'living in sin'  but the beatle type songs are good ones in that vien. So you have to be in the mood for  a rock cd that is not like mostly a kiss cd.

B000001EXR|4.0|Grunge metal had a limited time at the top. It was the music of self doom and suicide in some ways. but it had melody and was alot better than alot of thrash and even worse death metal that has limited vocals and little melody.  Kiss was always able to put forth a great disc of any style it chose. If they did a pop disc it was a good one, if they did more pop metal it was good pop metal, or if they did straight hard rock like 'creatures of the night' or a concept album it was very good too. fans wanted a straight hard sound usually though with some pop metal mixture.  This one was a good grunge disc that was recorded really when grunge was still around and released after it faded away. So it's a harder sounding disc that is darker and is ok as a grunge feeling disc. However unlike alot of grunge it doesn't have selfpity songs like grunge did. \\"I am a poor middle class white person ,blah , blah ,blah.' so at least we are spared the worst part of grunge when kiss does that style of music. Still being a fan of traditional hard rock and melodic metal of various types this is a kiss cd that I play the least probably.  Because I want kiss to give me songs like on 'sonic boom' or the 80's. still I can't say that this is a bad disc because like I said at least grunge had melody although it's a heavier type of melody that reminds me of black sabbath without the solos.  So if you are a fan of hard grunge type sounds without the self pity  then you will enjoy this one.
B000USU91W|5.0|This brilliant movie starts with a bang as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre explode. And then it just gets funnier and better. The puppets appear quite human so there's no problem with the \\"suspension of disbelief\\" whilst the heroes are fallible but likable.<br /><br />Spectacular cinematography abounds in the Panama Canal scenes and in Egypt where the Great Pyramid and the venerable Sphinx suffer the same fate as the Eiffel and the Louvre. The HQ of Team America at Mount Rushmore also sticks in the memory.<br /><br />Gary acts in a Broadway musical when the Team approaches him for help. One of the most arresting scenes shows Gary singing lead in a rendition of the hit song [[ASIN:B00031TXTU Everyone Has AIDS]]. The camera catches some well-dressed, nuanced members of the audience shedding an elegant, politically appropriate tear or two. Priceless!<br /><br />Things turn even more hilarious with the appearance of the Film Actors Guild (FAG), led by the silver-tongued Alec Baldwin. His speech, interrupted by rapturous desk-thumping by the assembled FAG-ers that include Susan Sarandon, Sean Penn, Jeanine Garofalo and a particularly DUH Matt Damon, is something to cherish. The comments to the media by some of these esteemed [[ASIN:0471706248 celebrities]] are equally side-splitting.<br /><br />Then there is of course the intercourse, a passionate scene between two attractive teamsters, giving new meaning to Leonard Cohen's album title [[ASIN:B000002AZX Various Positions]]. This is just a short interlude; I didn't find it particularly shock- or noteworthy. In the grip of passion, all sorts of things happen.<br /><br />Kim Jong Il is definitely a star of the movie with his cute accent and his banally evil personality. I caught myself entertaining thoughts of sympathy for Kim as he fed Hans Blix to his pet sharks. And the feeding itself reminded one again of the awesome savage power of nature. \\"Brix\\" (as Kim called him) learnt a lesson for trying to impose his silly western cultural norms on the beloved leader of North Korea. What arrogance to attempt such a thing!<br /><br />In the meantime, the porcine propagandist [[ASIN:B000GG4GIK Michael Moore]] has caused great damage at the Mount Rushmore HQ by blowing himself up with a suicide jacket. But when things look bleak, Gary returns as the hero. Kim is entertaining the FAG celebrities plus delegations of dignitaries from around the globe. This is to distract them while his minions are preparing to set off 230 major bombs around the world.<br /><br />Just in time Gary frees the team, then uses his skills as an actor and orator to deliver an eloquent speech that completely upstages Alec Baldwin, the master of ceremonies. The detonation of the bombs is averted and a fight to the death ensues between the Team and the [[ASIN:0767919025 Hollywood actors]]. A particularly sleazy looking Sean Penn meets his end at the fangs of a big black kitty cat, Sarandon is sliced in two and the others are shot in riveting gun battles.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I sorely missed Parker and Stone's most lovable characters, the Canadian master comedians Terrance and Phillip, whose movie Asses Of Fire contributed so much to making the [[ASIN:B000022TSW South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut]] so unforgettable. A bit of Terrance and Phillip's flatulence would have made this little gem even funnier.<br /><br />Easily bored, I don't like long movies. I am pleased to report that Team America: World Police holds the attention throughout. No scenes are superfluous or too lengthy, whilst the action sequences appear in the proper places. I think it might become a cult movie like [[ASIN:B00004U8P9 The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]. The best songs are the aforementioned Broadway number and Kim's I'm So Ronery ...<br /><br />Team America: World Police has a subversive message that ought to please all intelligent people with a sense of humor. The Gnostic nature of Gary's speech with which he wins over the audienceof worldwide dignitaries is particularly striking. Despite the vulgar references to reproductive and other organs, it contains a profound message.eferences to reproductive and other organs, it contains a profound message.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|Wow, if I had never known Cyndi Lauper and started fresh with MEMPHIS BLUES, I'd be ecstatic. Her voice along with blues legends and damn fine CD's worth of well-produced tunes makes for this request: MORE. Cyndi Lauper is ready to naile blues again; let this be the first of a whole new set of highly-desirable Cyns.<br /><br />BTW, doing material that was covered before is valid if someone like Cyndi restates the song; she does, and does it well, so comparing one tune to the Harry Nilsson version, or the original \\"Rollin' and tumblin'\\" is a great and happy surprise.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Words can't even explain how FANTASTIC and POWERFUL this album is. Every last track is worthy of listening to from beginning to end, and not too many can say that about alotta albums this day and age. The lyrics, the production, everything about this album is just right. This has got to be his most personal album YET. Listening to it, you can see how he's reached out more to the fans and showed more of what he's been going through for the past few years. This is what makes the album even more of a masterpiece, the fact that he let the listener into his mind. Also, as far as production goes, its his first album where he seeks the expertise of different producers as opposed to dre and gang from the previous releases. This proves that he can make a masterpiece and deliver on pretty much any beat.     Like I said in the beginning, words can't even explain how great this album is. The best I can tell anyone is to just grab a copy and listen for yourself. Yea, that's right. No free downloads or anything like that. PURCHASE this album. SUPPORT quality music, especially since most music today SUCKS. I guarantee you won't be dissapointed by this one AT ALL.    In closing, let's face the facts. Eminem is one of the best, if not, the best rapper alive. Regardless of whether he's black or white, race shouldn't matter. Its his lyrical content and delivery that has always propelled him to heights even he can't believe he's reached. And this album is nothing short of that. Recovery is the beginning of a new decade of success for Marshall Bruce Mathers!
B000001EIA|5.0|few bands get criticism like kiss does. But who cares they are one of the top bands ever and when they do a unplugged disc they do it right. There's great versions of their songs here and thanks to mtv which was still about music at least some back then. Now they are nothing but back then they helped bring unplugged music into popularity and they deserve kudos for that. Even if they aren't about music anymore or worse do rap junk and not even good rap at that.  Because of this fun acoustic guitar driven disc which was a hit cd they band got back together and were the 90's top touring band or at least near the top. They still remain one of the top bands worldwide ever and they deserve that. The songs here are a wide variety of songs from their career. Even the awesome 'world without heroes' from 'the elder' is on here. Of course some people can only accept a hardrocking kiss but kiss did every style of music they tried very well when they did it.  Of course we fans didn't want a pop disc like 'unmasked' but it's still a good pop cd. And if they keep to hard rockin and then expirement it would have never been a problem even to pop music haters.  But this is different , I mean who criticizes a 'unplugged' disc?<br />every band who wants to make one should just to do it. It's going to be different and kiss came out with a very fun one that appealed to fans and nonfans alike.<br />I mean it's not like bands do unplugged cds that often and it's ok to do them. So enjoy this one because it's one of the more enjoyable unplugged cds ever made.

B002TVQ4HG|5.0|IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!!!!! There really are no words to describe this movie. Every detail is important. All I could say at the conclusion was WHOA! I had the twist ending mostly figured out in the first two minutes of the movie, but certainly not all of it. You really just have to see this one to believe it. If you enjoy movies that mess with your mind, YOU MUST SEE THIS ONE. If I could rate it higher than five stars, I would. I was expecting it to be rather gruesome and hoping it wasn't. The blood is minimal and most of the suspense is psychological.     A woman, Jess, leaves her autistic son to go sailing. (What she does prior to leaving is very important.) A storm comes upon them in the Bermuda Triangle, forcing the crew to abandon their boat. Fortunately/unfortunately, there is a large ship that is nearby for them to board. But this new ship contains a masked assassin set on killing each of them one by one. Jess mentions how familiar the ship is to her, and how it seems like she has been there before...

Sadly,this CD on the budget Rebound label was several dollars cheaper & I was just too cheap to spend a couple extra bucks though I was fully employed at the time. I love the early melodies & witty songs (I also like the sound quality) of Bowie & this CD just makes me want more of his Deram label material! I'm not even sure \\"Deram Anthology\\" is still in print since lots of great CD's from the 90's are out of print. I guess that's what I get for being a cheapskate!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|TEMPLE GRANDIN has a committed following group of admirers of fine film making: the reason the group is not larger is that this little film is a 'made for TV' movie and that at times puts it into the 'inconsequential' category in people's minds.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The film deals with autism in an honest, extremely sympathetic and intelligent way.  While there have been other films that deal with the various forms of autistic behavior ('Adam', 'Rainman', 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', I am Sam', 'The Other Sister', 'Forest Gump', 'Little Man Tate' to name a few of the better known ones), few succeed on the level of this beautifully written adaptation of autobiographical books by the title character Dr. Temple Grandin (adapted by Christopher Monger and Merritt Johnson). It is fearless in its discussion of autism and for once shows how the autistic mind can function (for Temple, it functions in pictures and leads to a highly successful career as a scientist) in a manner that can be an incredible resource for mankind.  It simply works on every level, much to the sensitivity of director Mick Jackson who seems to understand the complexities of the mind of the central character as well as the responses of all of the ancillary characters.<br /><br />Claire Danes BECOMES Temple Grandin, so fine is her acting and her ability to bring the audience (and the cast of characters) into the inner workings of the autistic mind.  It is an astonishing performance of a mute four year old girl encouraged by her mother (Julia Ormond), her aunt (Catherine O'Hara), and one particular science teacher Professor Carlock (David Strathairn) who teaches her that doors (a common thread throughout the film) are meant to be opened because opportunity lies beyond.  How Temple progresses from special schools, learns to build a hugging machine that supplies the lack of embraces she apparently missed as a child, and becomes obsessed with the inhumane treatment of cattle in her observations of ranches and slaughter houses in Arizona, leads her to earning not only a college degree, but also a Masters and a PhD in Animal Husbandry.  Throughout the movie Claire Danes maintains her character's idiosyncrasies and her reaction to the frightening world around her with such credibility that she takes us with her on a journey of understanding the miracles that can happen with the minds of autistic people: no one thinks outside the box in a more positive manner than does Temple Grandin.  This is a beautifully made film on every level and one that should be required viewing for all people.

B000068OCS|5.0|The best example of Hollywood smartness. I saw this movie 30 times before get the obvious: this is all about 9/11 event. I have to say that seeing the United Airline plane scenes and seeing the buildings falling down had a profound effect on me. This movie makes Nostradamus looks like he wasn't even in kindergarten. It served to remind me of the main theme of the film, that the world of humans is overlaying nature, and that our world is out of balance. Some times viruses (terrorism) are the wild variables in a system that can destroy it and return things to balance. Hollywood is many things... but stupid is not one of them.

0307454541|1.0|Almost 200 pages into the book, I was really starting to get into the mystery of the Vanger family, and I was starting to warm up to the main characters (not easy, given the fact that they are both so devoid of emotion).  I was even giving the overly long descriptive passages, not-terribly-interesting financial corruption sub-plot, and odd sentence structure a pass - chalking it up to the author setting the mood and possible difficulties in translating.<br /><br />And then, out of nowhere: graphic, disgusting rape scenes that made my stomach turn.  None of the reviews I read warned me about this (thanks a lot, NY Times).  Because I had bought it for a book club, I skimmed through the rest of the book to see if it got better - nope, more descriptions of sadism and sexual violence sprinkled throughout.<br /><br />Having set up an otherwise interesting premise, the author really couldn't do better than plots one might see in the most distasteful episodes of Law & Order: SVU?<br /><br />I want my money back.  I was promised an intriguing, original mystery, and 200 or so pages in, it turned into a disturbing work of pulp fiction.  Yuck.

0789461080|5.0|As an 8th grade English teacher in a very inner city school, I've found that students absolutely love the Sherlock Holmes short stories we have available in abridged form.  Unfortunately, there are only seven stories.  Fortunately, they are all among the best.  But \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a complete novel and much too difficult to attempt in its original form.  The British Victorian vocabulary and tedious verbosity would lose them by page 2.  Then came this wonderful DK Classic abridged version.  Not only is it written in more modern English, with updated vocabulary and style, it contains fantastic color illustrations on almost every page.  Best of all are DK's exceptional marginal notes, explaining most of the Victorian references, and the perfect Introduction which hooks the young imagination right from the start.  Sadly this book is now out of print but I've obtained many copies through Amazon's listed sellers, for a fraction of the original cost.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|Immediately following is a review that I published on Amazon in 2008, to be used as a starting point for this particular version, with the additional material. . .<br />This has to be one of the best recorded concert albums of the 1960s--and it still holds up pretty well today. This was the Rolling Stones at the peak of their \\"stardom.\\" And, ironically, this was a part of the concert tour featuring the deadly events at Altamont, graphically captured in the movie \\"Gimme Shelter.\\" I'd love to go over each song in detail, but that would be too much. . . .<br /><br />The concert at Madison Square Garden leads off with one of the great rock songs of all time, \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\\" The opening riff is powerfully played; the rhythm section (Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman) is at its best; the guitar work (Keith Richards and Mick Taylor) is rock strong. Mick Jagger's vocals are a bit ragged, but that makes sense in the concert setting. Who wants to hear a song exactly as on the album (as too many stars play it today)? A wonderful live version of this classic.<br /><br />Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain\\" is pretty spare as he recorded it. The Stones cover this classic very well indeed. Jagger has always been a credible blues singer (note his live \\"Ya Gotta Move\\"). The guitar work is simple and backs the vocals well; the simple rhythm backing makes sense for this song. Blues-y and convincing.<br /><br />Then the paean to Albert DiSalvo, \\"Midnight Rambler.\\" This is probably the best recording of this song ever produced by the Rolling Stones. The subject of the song, the Boston Strangler, makes this creepy--but also great rock and roll. The introduction is improvisational, with Jagger starting before the band. They recalibrate and this work begins. Guitars chunk out notes, Jagger plays the harmonica, the rhythm section is strong. There is an extended instrumental break that is delightful. Taylor and Richards play well off one another; Mick Jagger's harmonica work is Dylan-esque. Then there is the part of this song, with drum beat, where he whacks the stage with his belt (if this is the way he performed it as he did in two later concerts in Buffalo, NY that I saw), as we head toward the grisly denouement. The last words are those spoken by the Strangler himself, lending, again, a chilling edge to this song.<br /><br />Then, to \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" very effectively performed, as the Stones seem to (no matter how unlikely) blame everyone for the Kennedys' death (\\"Who killed the Kennedys; Well after all, it was you and me\\").<br /><br />The concert album closes out with a leering and very rock and roll version of \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" (compare with the country version on the album). Finally, \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" where Jagger bemoans the fact that all he can do is sing in a rock and roll band, rather than being a street fighting man, because \\"in sleepy London town,\\" that's all he can do. This is a bookend piece with \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash,\\" providing a symmetrical close to the concert.<br /><br />So, to conclude, this is one of the most classic live concert recordings of the 1960s--and it still sounds good today. The Rolling Stones are much more polished performers now; the rawness then might be something they would want to try to recapture to some extent. . . .<br /><br />Now, the addenda to the original. . . .<br /><br />The new version includes the classic album. However, there are supplemental pieces here. One, a little booklet. Two, some additional tracks played by the Stones that were performed during the tour that were not included on the original version (as well as videos of these additional songs). Three, some accompanying artists' works, namely B. B. King and Ike and Tina Turner. Smoking stuff! A few words about these.<br /><br />The DVD and CD covering additional material. . . . The DVD is a bit of fun because there are additional snippets of the group at work. Some of the extra songs not on the original. . . . There is a blues-y version of Robert Wilkins' \\"Prodigal Son.\\" Spare--and this works well. Jagger singing and Richards on acoustic guitar. Raw music; it works well. Then Fred McDowell's \\"You Gotta Move.\\" This did not work well on the Stones' album including it. This live version, though, does the song justice. Again, spare. Keith on acoustic guitar and Mick singing. It captures the blues essence of this song.<br /><br />\\"Under My Thumb\\" features the whole band. A raw version of a raw song. . . . Then, cut up by intervening footage on the DVD, \\"I'm Free.\\" This is one of my favorite early Stones' songs. It starts off a bit too understated for my tastes, but--in the end--it works pretty well. Finally, \\"Satisfaction.\\" The familiar opening riff, Jagger begins his singing, her does his \\"dance.\\" This seems to have a bit more energy than the other songs noted in the DVD (and CD). The guitar work is good; Watts' drumming is solid and provides animation to the song.<br /><br />And the other performers? B. B. King has five songs here. His \\"Why I Sing the Blues\\" is well done.

Let's get the Klennex out and cry some more.  The book was depressing, all about herself and didn't really care about anything else.  I had no empathy for the dear women even after she listed her various anti-depression drugs.  I've been in a depressed state at one point in my left and I certainly didn't leave my family and run off to Italy and the likes!  Stay home and deal with it!  I didn't find the book have any spirituality value AT ALL.  The movie had better find some quality plot or it will be a flop too.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Element of Freedom is a very good album.  The writing is good with simple hooks.  What intrigues me about this album is the production.  The production is reminiscent of  the 80's.  You can hear some old school synths, and some of these songs like \\"This Bed\\" sound straight from the 80's R&B stations.  Songs like \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\" at times sounds like Prince with a a driven gated Genesis (Mama) drum machine.  Some of these drum patterns songs have a very Prince 80's feel to it.  \\"Wait Til' You See Me Smile\\"  has Keyboard on it playing that brought me straight back to Hall & Oates.  My point is that this album has a formula that has worked in the past, and of course with Alicia Keys singing on it it has a modern feel to it.  Old and young can enjoy this album.  It's a album you can play over and over, and each song is enjoyable.  Give it a chance.

B003TT2X72|5.0|When the first film in the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, \\"The Two Towers.\\" But if he second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen. Too bad this blu-ray is only the theatrical version!<br /><br />The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and suddenly it's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys. And to top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (\\"Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!\\" Pippin wails when a \\"tree\\" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam. And while there are some amusing moments, this movie is far darker than the previous one -- Gollum's eerie double-personality alone can make your skin crawl.<br /><br />And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.<br /><br />Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.<br /><br />But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play \\"Gandalf 2.0,\\" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman. The scene where he sees the ents attacking is outstanding.<br /><br />And for this blu-ray? For some insane reason, The Powers That Be just WILL NOT release the extended edition of this movie, even after all these years -- meaning that a giant chunk of the narrative is missing. Yes, it's the theatrical release... yet AGAIN. And the extras are from the theatrical version as well: spots, previews, an Emiliana Torrini music video, featurettes, trailers, Sean Astin's short film \\"The Long and the Short of It,\\" and some documentaries about making the movies.<br /><br />The journey continues in \\"The Two Towers,\\" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from \\"middle chapter syndrome.\\" But you may want to hang tight for the blu-ray of the full story.some amusing moments, this movie is far darker than the previous one -- Gollum's eerie double-personality alone can make your skin crawl.

But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play \\"Gandalf 2.0,\\" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman. The scene where he sees the ents attacking is outstanding.     And for this blu-ray? For some insane reason, The Powers That Be just WILL NOT release the extended edition of this movie, even after all these years -- meaning that a giant chunk of the narrative is missing. Yes, it's the theatrical release... yet AGAIN. And the extras are from the theatrical version as well: spots, previews, an Emiliana Torrini music video, featurettes, trailers, Sean Astin's short film \\"The Long and the Short of It,\\" and some documentaries about making the movies.     The journey continues in \\"The Two Towers,\\" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from \\"middle chapter syndrome.\\" But you may want to hang tight for the blu-ray of the full story.
B003A4IFGY|1.0|I am a huge Tom Petty fan.  I was so excited to get this CD.  There is not one song on it I even like.  What happened to Tom and the heartbreakers come on.  Tom Petty has put out some of the finest music.  In this CD its almost like he is trying to sound like The Doors and doing a bad job of it.  There is not one song on this CD I like.  And Tom Petty takes up a big part of of Ipod.  I actually put this CD on my Ipod then took it off.
B003HLM2QO|1.0|Since Sharon and Ozzy re-recorded the Blizzard era albums with a different drummer and bass player in order to cut the original guys out of payment for their contribution , I have had no respect for them. Yes , if you buy Blizzard now , you get re-recorded bass and drum tracks.......not the original. I bought a used dvd on Amazon to get the original. It seems to be all about the money now . New guitarist is great but has no writing chance here. If you want a great rock album buy Slash's new one...plenty of heavy songs and 1 track with Ozzy singing. Try Pagan's Mind if you want some great metal from the newer less known bands to the American audience. Metal is alive and well in Europe !
B003E48AYC|5.0|Johnny Depp is a great and versitle actor.  Tim Burton knows how to bring the best out of him.  Great movie - recommend to everyone.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|Just terrible.  I waited for two years to watch this and when it was finally broadcast I couldn't even finish it.  Oprah's narration represents everything wrong with America's image overseas.  It is embarrassing.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This was a Christmas gift I had purchased through eBay & was stiffed by a person committing fraud. That goes to show that my first choice & future choices will always be to go through Amazon.com. The item was shipped within a prompt manner & was reasonably priced. Thank God for sites like this you can trust. My niece enjoys this DVD!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show is so addicting!  I got my husband hooked after a few sideways glances.  The packaging is very unique and stunning.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I now have a great film starring Denzel Washington for the first time.  This is by far his best film for me, mainly because it's the only film he's starred in that I loved.  This is a great film, the story comes together and plays out very well, the acting is great and the effects are second to none.  This film truly immerses the viewer into a hellish post apocalyptic world.  Great story telling and film making.
B0026HTS12|4.0|Interesting collection of stories--mostly romantic relationships--against the spectacular backdrop of the neighborhoods of Paris.  Central to the film is the saga of a young dancer (Roman Duris) who is afflicted with literally a failing heart and awaits a heart transplant.  He is cared for by his single-mother sister (Juliette Binoche) who moves into his small, but spectacularly located apartment with her three children.  The sister has her own problems of the heart as do the film's secondary characters who orbit around the dancer's story.<br /><br />The film is a series of vignettes, connected mostly by the scenic wonders of the city.  There is a distinct French point-of-view here, sometimes not fully clear to an Anglo-Saxon perspective (at least not this one) and not fully explained through the film's subtitles.  Overall though, a beautiful and touching piece of cinema.  Recommended.
B003E48AYC|5.0|This is one of the best recent family movie releases I've seen this past couple of years. Tim Burton's vision and Depp's Mad Hatter come together in a stunning tour-de-force of live action w/cgi in an enchanting tale of the Next chapter of Alice in Wonderland, as Alice is grown up and returns to Wonderland to 'save the day' in this brilliant adaptation of the classic.<br /><br />Depps' best work since Jack Sparrow.  Wonderful characterizations from all the rest of the cast too, who work together flawlessly as an ensemble team; the chemistry and \\"fit\\" is right on the money.<br /><br />I'm glad they did the 'next chapter' as a story arc vs a straight retelling of the tale, which adds depth and continuity to this classic tale.  Perfect for children and adults alike, this is a thoroughly enjoyable story that captures the magic of Alice with humor, stunning effects and more.  One of the best family films since the original Shrek.<br /><br />Thanks to all who worked on this title, it must've been a ton of work to produce, direct, design and composite, and it's done flawlessly.  Our family will watch this many times in the years to come; thanks for creating this truly captivating movie, Tim.  I hope you folks will do a trilogy.  Bravo!<br /><br />To the magic,<br /><br />Ken
0307463745|2.0|I would recommend this book only to newbies who have really no idea about starting and running a business, yet even then there are numerous better titles out there. I actually stopped reading after about half the book since I just didn't get any insights from this title....

B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|A captivating story, made also into a great movie trilogy (in Swedish) - could hardly put the books down.<br /><br />Read the entire \\"Millennium Trilogy\\" in order:<br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo<br />The Girl who Played with Fire<br />The Girl who Kicked the Hornets' Nest
B000ELJBAK|5.0|One of my all time favorite Summer albums along with Chris Squire's Fish Out of Water & Bruford Gradually Going Tornado.  It's not officially Summer 'till they're played.  80-90 degrees and up.
0891419063|5.0|This is a story  of the suffering and hardship of  Pvt Sledge during the battle of Peleliu and Okinawa.The Peleliu campaign was a blood bath and the island was never used after this great battle and sacrifices of the Marines who gave the life.Pvt Sledges gives an first hand account from a mortarmen with the 1st Marine Division in both of these great and costly battles.
B003HLM2QO|2.0|It seems I had to put a star rating in to get my review on here,  so 5 stars just 'cause it's the Ozz. I just got this for Fathers Day.  I have been listening to Black Sabbath,  then Ozzy since the dark days.  I love them.  Just so you know,  I love the 1st 8 Sabbath albums,  then all the early, and some later Ozzy's including No More tears.  I'm a big fan of the melodies of old,  not so much the &#34;heavy metal&#34; of new (a million notes and a lot of noise on lead guitar).  I don't know this album yet but I  will let you know.  If I tell you to get it,  and you're old school Sabbath & Ozzy like me,  then get it. P.S.  Love the Bill Ward albums:  Ward One: Along the Way & When the Bough Breaks. Check out one of the latest ones too: &#34;The Dark Half&#34;.  On youtube or Bill's site. It kicks!  Bill Ward rules.  He oftimes has the Sabbath idea more than current Iommi and Butler. (love them too though).<br /><br />Sept. '10 UPDATE: 2 stars. Sorry,  but that means I don't like it. 1 star if I hated it, but it's just not my cuppa tea. Too bad for us old fans. P.P.S. STOP THE LOUDNESS WAR! Leave some breathing room or we'll all end up disliking all music!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Sometimes a TV series or movie comes along which hits on all eight cylinders.  Mad Men is one of them.  I'm a bit young to remember the time period of Mad Men's first season (1960), but the tone of the times feels right.<br /><br />Casting is wonderful.  Jon Hamm as Don Draper is a real find.  This guy is perfect in the role, Brylcreem and all.  He is a ad genius, a madly successful ad man who thinks on his feet, has brilliant insights, a beautiful loving wife (the unbelievably attractive January Jones), and two smart kids.  He has it all, but wants more.  He beds a series of women, because he likes them and likes the sex.  He just assumes his wife will be oblivious to that; and in those times maybe that happened more often than not.<br /><br />There are films or series that are mainly set in the workplace, but most don't focus on the day-to-day interactions, at that workplace.  We don't learn how to behave or interact in those series.  Obviously, there are some notable ones, but most of even those (The Office, NYPD Blue, House, The Wire) feature people we just don't know that well (cops, doctors, comedy writers, (and in the case of the Office, complete goofs)).  Mad Men, we can identify with, because we all consider ourselves somewhat of experts on advertising, since we see lots and lots of it, every day.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended. An excellent show in all regards.  Five plus stars for Mad Men.  They have a winner here.  Can you believe that HBO passed on this one?<br /><br />Let me add a bit on the DVD extras.  There are a lot of them, and insightful.  We learn, for example, that the first show (the pilot) was filmed in New York before moving to LA.  The sets feature ceilings, because the director wanted to show the period suspended ceilings (most productions have no ceilings because that's where the lights and other equipment hang).
B0000636UN|4.0|\\"C'mon C'mon\\" album (2002) ranks among Sheryl Crow's best and at the same time most public-oriented efforts. Rich in guitar riffs and strong melodies, it's ideal for a summer ride in a cabrio.   Starts with rocky \\"Steve McQueen\\" and \\"You're an Original\\", with summery \\"Soak Up the Sun\\" inserted - and it's better if you don't concentrate on lyrics too much, as Sheryl, as always, sometimes she gets lost in her own philosopies.  After the trip-hop influenced \\"Safe and Sound\\" (a bit out of place, but a beautiful love song about an ended romance) comes the trio of songs which best represent this album - the title track and \\"Over You\\" are on the sunny side, full-bloodied pop-rock and even the Don Henley duet \\"It's So Easy\\" fits there musically.  The rebellious \\"Lucky Kid\\" and tame \\"Diamond Road\\" are followed by the emotional centerpiece of the record - the \\"It's Only Love\\" and \\"Abilene\\" coupling with sprawling harmonies and vocals that you could come to love on songs like \\"The Difficult Kind\\" or later on \\"Wildflower\\" album. Following a Globe Session throwback \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" finally comes a breath of humid Southern air - the introspective closer \\"Weather Channel\\" - faithfully implicating stillness before a hurricane.  Sheryl Crow shows her optimistic musical side on \\"C'mon C'mon\\" - although she is positive only on the surface in many songs here, overall, if you're gonna like it, it's  because of its summer attitude.
B002NPY7FE|4.0|Not much in terms of extras, but one of those minimalist, situational horror movies that still work!
0786868724|5.0|Wonderfully written, touching stories that are greatly needed in these turbulent times.<br />I truly enjoyed reading this book.
B000P0J0EW|4.0|I ordered this DVD as a gift and was hoping it would arrive on time - which it did.  The entire transation was smooth without any problems.  I am most satisfied.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Kick-Ass was surprisingly a great movie. I definitely did not think it was for me based off of the trailers and previews, but the only reason i went is because my friends wanted to go. I read the comic and then watched the film and it was one of the best times i have had in a movie theater. It was funny, the action was awesome, and nic cage was actually cool again. Sadly nobody went to go see it in theater even though the reviews are great. I am guessing because the advertising doesn't really convey the movie properly and people think its a dumb movie like mystery men or something. Prior to its release sequel talks were heavy and almost a definite possibility but because of the weak performance things have quieted down....so now its up to the dvd and blu ray sales. SO BUY BUY BUY!
B000JQUMPI|4.0|Definitely a classic that I think should be required reading.  There are some parts that are a bit drawn out, but overall I find it an excellent book.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I know that her record label chose all the songs here and gave her no creative control, but I still liked the CD and think it's her best one.  It's the only one where she doesn't try too hard to be a tough rocker chick.  I liked every song on this one.
B000GCFG7E|3.0|A lot of this one seems to have been written to justify a tax deduction for a trip to England. There are many descriptions of well-known London sights. Reacher speculates that the London Eye might be for the tourists. What a smart guy! I am planning to read all the Reacher series, in order, but I am losing my enthusiasm. The action scenes seem too easy to me. Reacher turns, grabs something and POW, BIFF, BAM! He breaks some bones. Or he throws the guy he's stalking off by running quickly around the building! I don't know, it just doesn't seem spectacular to me. Maybe Reacher is just a modern-day Billy Jack.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Never was a phrase, \\"torn from the headlines,\\" more appropriate for a TV show. This dramatic tale of a wronged politician's wife brings instantly to mind famous couples such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, John and Elizabeth Edwards, Darlene and John Ensign, Jenny and Mark Sanford, and David and Wendy Vitter. But the circumstances that most closely resemble those used in \\"The Good Wife\\" are those of Silda and Eliot Spitzer. In 2008, Spitzer resigned as governor of New York after it was revealed that he had spent public funds on high-priced call girls. In his case, his resignation halted potential prosecution. Not so for Peter Florrick (Chris Noth, best known as Mr. Big, Carrie's lover in [[ASIN:B00004RFCM Sex and the City]]). In \\"The Good Wife,\\" the husband of the titular \\"good wife,\\" resigns as the state's attorney of Cook County, in the Chicago area of Illinois, after he's exposed for the same crime as Spitzer. But his successor gets Peter thrown in jail.<br /><br />The series' opening scene involves Peter's wife, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies, [[ASIN:B00005JLFT ER]]), nobly, and humiliatingly, backing up Peter as he announces to the press he is resigning. Then the scene switches to six months in the future. Peter is in jail. Alicia has been forced to downsize from a big house to an apartment, and she's looking for a job. For her entire marriage, Alicia has sacrificed her education and professional talents in favor of supporting her husband's political career and caring for their two children, now young teenagers. But with Peter's needs now moot, and his income gone, it's time to dust off her law degree and seek a paid position.<br /><br />Though she is forty-something and out of touch with the legal world, Alicia manages to use one of her own connections to snag a position as a junior associate at the firm of a friend from law school, Will Gardner (Josh Charles, best known for [[ASIN:B001B187BQ Sports Night]]). But the job has two major drawbacks. First, Will sees her as the one that got away, and Alicia is in no mood for that kind of complication. And, second, the job is not secure. She is in competition with another new junior associate, Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry, Rory's college boyfriend in [[ASIN:B000U0F7RG Gilmore Girls]]), who is the very definition of a whiz kid. Worse, though Cary is extremely competitive, Alicia is naturally collegial and kind, and it goes totally against the grain for her to try and cut anyone out.<br /><br />I was sold on this show from the opening scene of the pilot. Every actor in it is great, but the three main female actors are particular standouts. First and foremost, Margulies is wonderful. In fact, one might say she was made for this part. It requires some of the most difficult skills an actor can have, in my humble opinion, to subtly indicate a whole range of emotion on the face of a character who is dignified and reserved by nature. Margulies manages to accomplish this with astounding ease given the limitations of her character's personality. It would have been out of character, for example, for Alicia to employ standard \\"bits of business\\" that other actors use such as grabbing or shoving to show anger. Instead, she shows subtle nuances of expression. Most of all, Margulies reveals Alicia to us by displaying in every scene perhaps Alicia's most sterling virtue, a quiet empathy which connects her to and draws out every other character she comes in contact with. This quality coupled with keen observation and a brilliant, analytical mind are the main attributes that allow Alicia to not only succeed as a trial attorney but to solve mysteries surrounding the cases she takes on--allowing this series to be a fascinating combination of mystery, political, legal and relationship drama, all rolled into one. Most of all, Margulies's talent as an actor allows the audience to understand and believe in every choice that Alicia makes, no matter how difficult, from the loyalty she displays to the unfaithful husband she obviously has loved deeply for many years, to her firm but affectionate relationship with her children, to her tactful handling of her meddling mother-in-law, to her often morally ambiguous encounters with her co-workers and her clients.<br /><br />The second amazing woman in this series is the ever marvelous Christine Baranski ([[ASIN:B001GKJ2DY Mamma Mia!]] and [[ASIN:B00140PK8C Cybill]]) as Diane Lockhart, a co-partner with Alicia's boss Will. It does not surprise me that a comic actor as phenomenal as Baranski is also an outstanding dramatic actor. Most actors seem to agree that doing comedy is so difficult that drama seems comparatively easy. In this series, Baranski's character Diane has a complex relationship with Alicia and has plenty of juicy plot lines of her own.<br /><br />The third female actor whose performance I greatly admire is Archie Panjaba (the heroine's older sister in [[ASIN:B00005JM2Y Bend It Like Beckham]]), who plays the enigmatic Kalinda Sharma. Kalinda rather rapidly develops what seems to be a strong friendship with Alicia, demonstrating an amazing amount of helpfulness and loyalty to her. But Kalinda's background and true intentions toward Alicia remain intriguingly unclear throughout the whole first season.<br /><br />Among the male actors, my personal favorite is the fabulously versatile Scottish actor Alan Cumming (Glitch the Scarecrow in [[ASIN:B0010X744G Tin Man]] and Nightcrawler in [[ASIN:B001PPGAKS X-Men]]). He plays Peter's cunning political adviser, Eli Gold, and this role is the dead opposite of the odd, quirky types he's most famous for. Eli is conservative and muted, almost benignly invisible in his presentation to the general public. But underneath he seethes with passion and is a powerful, back-room player in the world of politics. His relationship with Alicia is one of the most dynamic in the series and his role in one of the key decisions she makes at the climax of season 1 is absolutely pitch perfect. And, by the way, his American accent is perfect.<br /><br />I personally adore dramas that present the protagonist with moral dilemmas every week that are filled with shades of gray. This series abounds in that dynamic. I also much prefer dramas that have two clear story tracks, the protagonist's professional life (in this series a weekly legal case for Alicia to pursue, with a frequent mystery thrown into the mix as I mentioned above), and the protagonist's personal life. Because of Peter's scandal, there are plenty of juicy sinkholes for Alicia to inadvertently step into as she weaves her way through a landscape of seemingly endless people who want to use her or abuse her because of her connection to her husband. This thread in the series has allowed it to avoid falling into the aggravating pattern of so many dramatic TV series of melodramatic emphasis on the personal failings of the protagonist and her close family members in ways that often turn that protagonist from sympathetic to pathetic and annoying. I am greatly hoping this series continues to avoid that pitfall for many years to come.ously has loved deeply for many years, to her firm but affectionate relationship with her children, to her tactful handling of her meddling mother-in-law, to her often morally ambiguous encounters with her co-workers and her clients.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|First, when it did work, which was intermittent at best, there were awsome moments. But this product is plagued with popping and interference even though multiple attempts wwere made to get rid of ANYTHING in the house which might be interfering with it, even tried unplugging everything else in the house!  But the biggest issue is not the fact that this product was released with major issues, but the fact that it is SO COSTLY and made so cheaply.  I am sure technology was put into these, but you must build things better for 199.00.  Wait for a better product for probably half to 2/3rds the price that is built with something other than cheap plastics and poor connections.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I am a fan of MJ's going all the way back to the music from the early days of the Jackson Five. After being incredibly saddened by his untimely passing, I put off seeing this on cable for months. Partly because I was still mourning the loss of one of my childhood heroes. And partly because I didn't want to watch it and see a frail shadow of the man we knew in the 80's, performing old hits in poor voice and with half-a*s dancing. After all, the media had made it out to seem like he was on his last legs preparing for this tour, in horrible condition physically and musically. Ha, was I ever wrong, and so were his critics.<br /><br />I watched this from start to finish and despite it's long length, I could have watched much more. This is truly mesmerizing- the MJ of the eighties was still there, but a new intensity and sultry attitude made him seem more powerful and enigmatic than ever. His backing musicians and especially his backup dancers are the best I've ever seen, and their complete love and devotion for MJ and the tour they were sadly never to embark on was obvious. Love poured out of this whole film- I've never seen such a group of talented, focused, dedicated people come together. It was extraordinary. The old hits were there- \\"Stop the Love\\" and \\"I Want You Back\\" from the Jackson 5 heyday. \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Thriller\\" (which included a fabulously remastered version of the Vincent Price \\"rap\\"- I swear, it sounded like Vincent had come back to life it my living room, it was so crystalline and vibrant). A spectacular rendition of \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" (never one of my favorites) had Michael singing better than he did on the \\"Bad\\" album, from which the song originally came. I couldn't believe what a fifty-year-old man was accomplishing vocally and in his dancing. There were more songs, but the standouts, which I did not at all expect, were \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" and \\"Earth Song\\". \\"Earth Song\\", especially, just got me down to the core. I had to fight back tears watching the indescribable video which was shot as a backdrop to this song, with MJ's lovely tenor singing lyrics that tore into me like a knife. Even writing this review, I find it hard not to recall what I watched without tears coming forth. The wonderful part was they played virtually every song in it's entirety, not just little snippets like some annoying DVD's of other singers. It really was like watching a whole MJ concert.<br /><br />Michael's voice was clear and the high notes were sung as well as he ever had as an adult, maybe better. And the dancing, my God- Michael was as lithe, fit and magical as ever on stage. His trademark precision and flexibility were on full display and he showed no signs of aging other than saving his voice for the actual concert. If he was not up to par here, I would say it. The MJ I saw in this movie was clear-headed, with the same phenomenal and futuristic vision that made us all stop and watch his ground-breaking videos in the 80's. He wasn't at all the foggy-minded, lost soul the media portrayed- he was a loving but strong and decisive man on this ill-fated tour. Let me tell you- all the skeptics, the naysayers and liars would be silenced after watching this. I feel incredibly sorry for the people who worked so hard on a tour that would never come to be, a tour they thought would be the highlight of their career.<br /><br />I will be buying this because I loved it so much, and hope the money goes to his wonderful children. Thank you, MJ, wherever you are, for this final gift. I hope your murderer spends the rest of his life rotting in prison, as was said in \\"The Green Mile\\", knowing he killed one of God's true miracles. May people remember you forever.

B000006OHL|5.0|What makes a great film score. Well, if you watch and listen today, you'll find scant answers. Most films function on pop soundtracks or electronic cotton that is about as gripping as my espresso machine overheated.<br /><br />It was, of course, not always like this, and if you go back to the 1950s until about 1975, I can name you at least ten great film composers and ten times that many great film scores. I'll say Quincy Jones, Lalo Schfirin, Jerry  Goldsmith, and I am leaving a lot--room fulls, of people out, just to make my point of how deep the bench was.<br /><br />One of the top hitters on that bench was Bernard Herrmann, who you probably know for one of a number of great accomplishments: he wrote the theme for the \\"Twilight Zone,\\" and he scored most of the classic Alford Hitchcock films, including the classic shower string shriek in Psycho. Two of the 20th Century's most recognizable pieces of sound are Bernard Herrmann's<br /><br />So is the music from 1976s Taxi Driver. I probably don't need to tell you, but the film is about a cabbie going insane in 1970s New York, and, in the subtext about the trouble those retuning from Vietnam had readjusting to society that had changed on them when they were gone.<br /><br />Taxi Driver is one of those films you watch from the start and know that something is wrong--horribly wrong, and that though nothing has yet happened, it is going to be even worse than you thought when it does.<br /><br />Now there are a lot of ways to judge a film score, but here is one viable criteria: does the score make you see the movie, and even more important make you feel the film's emotions, when not watching.<br /><br />Well, if this is the yardstick, Herrmann's score measures perfectly across. Most of his work here is wrapped around tense a two note theme, followed by a soothing jazz interlude, and then just as you're starting to soothe, the two notes pierce once more.<br /><br />But so what? It doesn't matter how Herrmann gets you there, but that he does. There is a slow boil to this music, the feeling in the soft shadows that things can explode at any second. Herman is working with chemicals here: soft, deliberate, gentle. Nice to watch.<br /><br />But if he sneezes, if the wrong liquid drops into the wrong tube, all that softness and all that dark caution mean nothing.<br /><br />We all know what happens.usic, the feeling in the soft shadows that things can explode at any second.

0446691437|4.0|This is one of those must-have reads for any person who feels a calling to create, whether that is as a writer, artist, or entrepreneur. It's written like a 165-page daily devotional, split into 3 sections, and each page being filled with common sense practical inspiration.<br /><br />The first section defines the enemy of all creators: Resistance. Section two addresses how to combat resistance by stressing the importance of \\"turning pro\\", whilst the third one covers the \\"higher realm\\" associated with creativity, particularly the role of the muse.<br /><br />I had an epiphany as I read section 2. Having a strong sense of being called to write and struggling with it as a hobby, not a vocation, whilst dreaming of grandeur, I tended to think like a hobbyist and not a professional. \\"Turning pro\\" spoke to my heart: start thinking and doing like writing is my vocation, not a hobby. Yes, it's common sense and logical. One never gets any good at anything unless one adopts a professional training mindset: the 10,000 hours concept Malcolm Gladwell espouses in \\"Outliers\\". I particularly loved page 84: \\"A professional dedicates himself to mastering technique\\". I've adopted the self-help style of learning technique via using books and other materials rather than going for broke with professional help, whether that is college, mentoring, or whatever. As Pressfield states, one masters the technique \\"because he wants to be in possession of the full arsenal of skills when inspiration does come...He knows that by toiling beside the front door of technique, he leaves room for genius to enter by the back.\\" Great, great, great.<br /><br />This little book is full of quotable quotes and will be one of those references I re-read many times over as I strive to be the best writer that I've been called to be. And no longer do I think I am being selfish in endeavouring to do such, as Pressfield outlines, we need everyone to be the best at what they have been called to do, otherwise we are letting down ourselves, the rest of humanity for not giving them our best and God who gave us the gift and passion in the first place.<br /><br />Read it. Consume it. Over and Over. You're heart will start singing with wonder.rest of humanity for not giving them our best and God who gave us the gift and passion in the first place.    Read it.

Each postcard told a story of its own, and there were many I could relate to at many levels. A good buy, I am pretty sure I will pick it up from time to time, and find something new in there.<br /><br />Like many reviewers have said this before, it is unique, and it was something, that I am sure many people can relate to and feel \\" I am not that different after all\\"<br /><br />I wanted to have something on my coffee table- living room, that could start a conversation- I am pretty sure it will.
0307266303|5.0|This extraordinarily well written book is about running, but it isn't.  It's about eating, but it isn't.  It's about good health, but it isn't.  And it's about love and friendship.  It is not about telling you what you should do or eat or believe.    I have read it twice and I NEVER read books twice, at least, not in the same decade.  I may read it again, too.  Got it for my 40-something-year-old daughter and now, she's reading it, and I know she'll pass it along to her friends.
0316010669|5.0|well written, easy to read . fasinating synopsis of the intuitive nature of the human being. highly recommend to read. I have now bought five other books written by the same author, Malcolm Gladwell.
B000ASDFEU|3.0|If you're going to purchase this video be sure to read Cornelius Ryan's book first otherwise you'll be completely lost as to the travesty this battle was... Montgomery was a fool to even make the attempt and the mistakes, precisely and concisely laid out in Ryan's book are not ever made clear in the film... I would have thought that the three hours would bring some clarity but it only confuses the uneducated viewer. So again, don't waste your money unless you purchase the book along with the video and read it first.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|I'll talk a little about the movie, but mainly I want to focus on the Bluray transfer.  First of, this transfer is first rate.  This is the kind of movie that sells HDTVs and BD players.  You want to show off the superiot picture and sound off to friends, reach for this one.  The detail and clarity are astonishing.  Eye-candy through and through.  You can see the smallest beads of sweat of the characters faces as well as enjoy the eye-popping special effects which look amazing.  I got this on sale from amazon for 9.49, which is unbeatable.  If you're a fan and love Bluray, go for it.<br /><br />The movie is an excellent action movie with a lot to recommend.  The clear discussion here is comparing this version to Ang Lee's.  Although this movie is a kind of reboot, it's a sequel to that film, only with a new cast and director.  As story goes, I prefer Ang Lee's \\"Hulk\\".  That film was as invested in the story, characters and drama as it was with its spectacular action and effects.  There was more poetry in it.  This version is more what people expected the first time around.  More straight forward action, although even those set pieces are nowhere near as imaginative as the duels Ang Lee put together.  Tim Roth is a great addition, adding another terrific villain to his repertoire as Emil Blonsky.  Norton, Tyler, and Roth are fabulous, but it's William Hurt that grated on me.  I wish Sam Elliot had reprised his role.  Hurt always seems to think he's in MacBeth and his line delivery is kind of ridiculous.  Elliot was more authentic, conflicted and sympathetic.  Hurt comes off as a common creep.<br /><br />Still, this version also makes the links between ther Justice League, with references to Stark Industries and a cameo by Robert Downey Jr. which are prepping us for the big movie event coming which includes all of Stan Lee's superheroes and the actors who have played them.<br /><br />Sit back and enjoy.  The BD is amazing.  Near 3-D clear picture and DTS-HD MA 5/1 sound which will rattle your house...this is the stuff of bluray bliss.r house...this is the stuff of bluray bliss.
B003A4IFGY|4.0|I sat in the doctor's office and saw that Tom and the boys had a new album, it was a \\"critics choice\\" and it was a blues album.  Damn, never much cared for the blues much, they kinda bring me down.  However, I was a long way from home, a big TP and the Heartbreakers fan, and needed a new CD.  So I bought it.  I threw it in, had a few errands to run and 14 and a half songs later, I was truly disappointed.  Dag nab it, this isn't for me - BUT I was a long way from home and needed to hear something new.  So now I'm on the open road and Jefferson Jericho Blues comes around again and I turn it up.  I decide the first 2 songs are darn good and then Runnin' Man's Bible kicks in and I've got it turned all the way up and it never comes down.  Wow.  Now, I've forced myself to listen to some stinkers before and come around to 2 or 3 songs, but never have I done a complete 360 like I did on this one.  By the time I had to stop to pee, I was texting my brother.  For you 1 starrers out there, listen again and listen LOUD.  Get over the fact that it doesn't completely sound like a Tom Petty album and give it a second chance. Guitars are rippin', keyboards are crazy, drums are spot on, and lyrics are beyond belief.  Everything else is gravy.  Wow.  Now I'm taking 1 star away because no album should exceed 10-12 songs and I think maybe this should've been stretched out over 2 albums over 2-3 years.  Just listened to a radio show that has a bonus track that is as good as anything on the album, so more proof this should've been more than a 1 album project. Anyhow, the more you listen to this album the more you like it and songs you didn't like before you suddenly get.  It's truly amazing and I'm really glad they made this album.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Many are familiar with the story of Hachiko, a dog who waited for his master to return to the train station every day, at the same spot, even after his master died in Japan.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0031RAOVY Hachi: A Dog's Tale]] is an updated version set in America.  Hachi's master is Professor Parker Wilson, who rescues Hachi, a young puppy lost at a train station.  Initially, Wilson's wife does not want to keep Hachi, but relents and he becomes a beloved pet.  The Wilsons have a daughter, but are mourning the loss of their dog, Luke.  Hachi brings the family from the brink of loss and back into the joys of love, sharing, and community.  But Hachi's grateful reach spreads to the town folk, and he becomes a fixture in town.<br /><br />A weepie, for sure, but not maudlin.  The film oozes warmth and amity, with wonderful performances by Richard Gere and Joan Allen.  There is something so natural about this film.  Nothing is forced, each scene just unfolds.  And the dog does not dominate.  The real subjects are love, friendship and loyalty - the best in both man and dog.  It really is a beautiful story.  If you have a pulse, you should watch it.
0525421580|5.0|Will Grayson has always lived in the shadow of his friend Tiny, \\"the world's largest person who is really, really gay, and also the world's gayest person who is really, really large\\" (3).  Although they've been best friends for years, Will is increasingly annoyed at being dragged along by Tiny, his plans for his musical called Tiny Dancer, and his plans to hook Will up with a girl named Jane.  Meanwhile, across town, will grayson hates his life.  His only solace is his online relationship with a boy named Issac, the only person who knows will is gay.  When Will and will unexpectedly meet, their relationships become tied up together, and both Wills begin to be forced to actually make decisions in their lives.<br /><br />Will Grayson, Will Grayson was a fun book that combines humor and adolescent angst in a way that feels real and poignant.  Each Will is a distinct character.  Will has gotten through life by staying in the shadows, and although he doesn't regret writing a letter to the school paper in defense of Tiny, he's determined to avoid any other changes in life by never committing or offering opinions.  will is full of stereotypical \\"emo\\" angst, but his cynicism is true of many teenagers.  Musing on his mom's attempt to engage in morning conversation, will thinks: \\"i feel bad for her -- i do. a damn shame, really, that i had to have a mother. it can't be easy having me for a son. nothing can prepare someone for that kind of disappointment\\" (23).<br /><br />Tiny is the world around which each boy revolves, and the reader can't help but adore Tiny.  He's so full of life and love for everyone, and despite the growth of the Wills in the novel, it's Tiny who's the standout character.<br /><br />The issues of first love, high school relationships, and coming out are done well.  The book presents a range of gay characters with different personalities.  The depths and importance of male friendships are acknowledged in a way that few teenagers would be willing to admit, but they are very sweet..
030726999X|5.0|After the dismal and shockingly badly written \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire (GWPWF)\\", I really wasn't sure if I would persevere but am glad I did cos Stieg Larsson really pulls out all the stops and succeeds in redeeming himself magnificently with this thrilling and brilliantly executed concluding instalment of the Millenium Trilogy. Like its predecessor, there are still too many indistinguishably colorless characters with walk on parts that overtaxes and clutters one's memory bank unnecessarily, but all's forgiven considering the sheer enormity of the pay off.<br /><br />It's all the more remarkable that Larsson has done such a great job of keeping the reader in taut suspense and turning the pages feverishly when the heroine Lisbeth Salander spends most of the time being heavily guarded and confined to her hospital bed with only her allies outside digging desperately to unravel the secret about the enemy out to destroy her. That and the fact that the enemy's identity is implied if not explicitly named or revealed less than half way through the story.  Whereas its predecessor was absent a plot or if there was one, stalled and went nowhere, \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest(GWKHN)\\"'s success can be credited to its well thought out plotting and devilishly clever pacing. Like when a newly introduced and quite obviously heavyweight character emerges quite early in the story only to get dispatched so suddenly and in such an unexpectedly violent manner, is an example of how Larsson might go for the ice pick in the forehead effect, though there's nothing predictable about his pacing. He mixes up his shots like playing a great tennis match to deliver an experience that's simply exhilarating.<br /><br />Many readers have written about the book's terrific ending - I can only agree. Just when you think it's a wrap, you vaguely recall there's some unfinished business left and find yourself embroiled in a slugfest that should satisfy the hardest to please reader of action novels.  A fitting ending to the tortured early life of Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />Hard to believe but GWKHN does live up to its hype !  A fantastic read !ting ending to the tortured early life of Lisbeth Salander.    Hard to believe but GWKHN does live up to its hype !  A fantastic read !
0385523386|4.0|Piper Kerman shares her experience in a women's correctional facility (Danbury) for an old drug crime she committed as a young woman.  Through the course of the book she describes not just the actual day-to-day experience which is in itself interesting, but also the people who become apart of her life for 11 months.  I think this is the most interesting part of the book.  From the initial shock of being a new inmate and the way each \\"tribe\\" reaches out, to the life in the dorms with the other women, the stories of each woman is also just as compelling and in many cases heartbreaking.  I think for me this book opens your eyes to the lifestyle of being in prison, the \\"programs\\" offered to help people transition back into society (or lack of them), and why so many people end up back in prison again.  I'm glad this book wasn't sensationalized to be what we see on TV- lots of anger, violence and sex.  Instead a large group of women trying to survive the day-to-day struggles away from their loved ones and deal with the mistakes they had made long ago.  I felt Piper held back very little of this experience, how she felt and how it really was for her and these women.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Just when we thought nothing new could come our way from the Beatles, surprise!! Here it is! A wonderful re-mix of The Beatles best known and even some obscure greats. Hopefully THE Martins will take another crack at giving us fans another wonderful mix.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|No, I will not buy this so called Blu-ray version of Gladiator. Too many agree it's just awful. Unfortunately, I doubt if there will ever be a better version.  For some reason our words make no impression.  Even though we help keep them in business, they choose never to respond to our concerns.  Sorry, that just the way it is.  Sure hope they prove me wrong.  This title deserves better.
B003G8WI7G|5.0|If you like funked up brass jazz you're going to love Trumbone Shorty's Backatown.  Backatown mixes the musical DNA of the Funky Meters and the Rebirth Brass Band.  If this doesn't make your feet smile I'd recommend defibulation of your rhythm muscle ... cuz somethin' bad wrong with your Durational Pattern.  It's today's New Orleans' brass.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|A bit of fun, where players get to balance greed and prudence. Roll for Braaaiiiiins, but don't get shotgunned. 3 shotgun blasts in a turn, and you lose any Brains you got in that turn. Know when to stop. Green dice have the most brains and fewest shotgun blasts; Red have the fewest brains and the most blasts; Yellow are in between. It's a great party game and ice-breaker, and its fun to see people egg each other on with the cry of \\"Don't Be a Chicken, Roll Roll Roll!\\"    I rate the durability low, because I've already lost a die. It's easy to do, although the game is still very playable with the remaining 12.    I'd say this game is good from about 8 years old (very smart) 10 (average).
B001C08RHA|4.0|The movie was great. It was in widescreen and we needed full screen. We could not find it as needed so I bought what was available. Went back and looked at product description and finally found \\"format\\". He enjoys the movie, but would have appreciated the other format.

B0026J8LHM|5.0|This is only the 5th Dream Theater album I've owned (which is not that many compared to their entire discography), but I think this is my favorite album of theirs in the past 8 years.  Every single song is completely epic.  There is only one song on the album that is under 10 minutes long, and instead of letting all the songs drag on, Dream Theater does a great job of keeping things interesting.  They manage to paint an epic Progressive-Metal landscape with each track.  If you like Dream Theater, chances are you'll like this album!
B001PA0FFO|5.0|We all experience doubt about important experiences in our lives. How we respond to them, I think, depends on our predilection based on other life experiences, consciousness level, openness of mind, etc. How Sr. Aloysisus (played by Streep) responds to the potentiality of sexual abuse occurring in her school is colored by her hostility towards Fr. Flynn's (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) liberal Catholicism. What is the truth of the situation? We are not told, and so we have our own doubt. How do we decide? What predilection do we have? Personally, my predilection is toward the weak, therefore I side with Sr. Aloysius and the boy Donald. Can we suppress our predilections and so get closer to the truth? It may mean having doubt about our cherished institutions, ideals, philosophies, etc. Can we make those leaps? I think the movie raised some very very important issues and challenges for us all!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I enjoy this cd because it has one of my favorite songs on it, Love Story. The rest of the songs, though I have not heard them, are also definitely worth a listen.

0525423842|2.0|I haven't read a lot of mysteries for adults, so I don't know Grisham's other writing, but as a children's librarian, I have read quite a few mysteries for children, and I think this one falls short. He tells us emotions rather than showing them. The characters are not well-differentiated, and they just don't have much pizazz to them. Theo is a Nancy-Drew-like throwback, granted very polite and earnest, but without much character himself. It wasn't really a page-turner. I was mildly interested in how things would turn out, and found the ending unsatisfying (I knew I was in trouble when I had only 2 pages left & the mystery hadn't really been solved.)Is this just the 1st half of the story? I don't think I care enough to get the sequel.    Other series are much better written : Shane Peacock's The Boy Sherlock Holmes; Nancy Springer's Enola Holmes; Elise Broach's books \\"Shakespeare's Secret\\" and \\"Masterpiece\\"
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I stumbled across Two Steps From Hell like many others by hearing them on youtube.  I am very glad to see an album that I can buy and hopefully as more people purchase the scores, they will release more of their CDs.  I'd buy their whole collection if they made it available.
B003HTPHSQ|4.0|I have not been a Cyndi Lauper fan. I haven't followed her career. I can't even tell you the name of any of her previous albums. I do remember her voice though, and have always liked whatever I have heard of it.   I am a music fan, and have been giving many artists a listen these last few years. As I mature in age I also mature in my appreciation of different types of music. The Blues is one of these types that I am starting to generate an interest in. So speaking from a novice blues listener, I really like what Cyndi Lauper has produced here. I was not familiar with any of the songs so they were fresh to me. Cyndi really works them as do the other luminaries on the album.    I would recommend this work to those that would like some accessible but hard working blues.  Cyndi Lauper has a new fan.
030726999X|5.0|I read the whole trilogy in less than a week and am heartbroken that it is over. I read these books with my computer on an and looked things up as I went along. Yay for google earth. The saddest part is that the author has died and with as many as ten outlines already completed for more Blomkvist. What a shame to have lost such a talent.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I am not a big movie fan of these types of movies but I bought it and watched it with my wife and son. The high def on a flat screen was really good and you could not help but get into this movie. Even if you are not a fan of these kind of movies this movie is a winner for anybody. I chose the free delivery and it showed up in 3 days which was great. Ended up buying more on this site and my IPad protector. Great website with a good and fair price.
B001FB4W16|5.0|I enjoyed Charlaine Harris's books a great deal. I like to compare and contrast both books and series. The series is close enough and it's fun to watch just the same.
B001U7B4T8|1.0|This DVD was a great disppointment because:  1.  It is quite an incomplete representation of the concert - only selected performances are included and it misses perhaps most of the best; and 2.  the picture quality is quite poor - fuzzy images with a strange color caste.  In summary, don't bother with this one.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS has its moments.  In fact the whole movie would have been better served if Brad Pitt and his commando team had been left out of the movie completely.  The story would have been sustainable if the plot was  limited to the Jewish cinema manager plotting her revenge against the Germans.  The Basterds themselves are a mere subplot lost in the bigger story.<br /><br />The primary plot is that of a Jewish girl as the sole survivor of a farmhouse massacre. Four years later she finds herself as the proprietor of a Paris cinema where the Germans have planned to screen the French premier of a German sniper movie.  As it turns out the leadership of the Third Reich will also be in attendence.  The theater is subsequently rigged as a pyrotechnic trap.<br /><br />So far, so good.  Unfortunately Brad Pitt and his blood thirsty band are inserted into the story.  Essentially the Basterds have one major scene where they brutally interrogate captured German prisoners while collecting scalps from the German dead.  They later play but a small supporting role in the cinema adventure.<br /><br />One of the things you have to realize about this film is that it is historical fantasy with a comic book quality story.  It is not designed to be historically accurate.  As such if you are a World War Two buff you have to set aside your expertise and turn a blind eye to the dozens of blatant geographic, uniform, and general historical inaccuracies presented throughout this film.<br /><br />I give the Quentin Tarantino credit for attempting a European style war film (At least that portion excluding the Basterds).  This movie has some similarities to Paul Verhoeven's BLACK BOOK.  For that I give it two stars.  Otherwise Tarantino was as much out of his depth as when Spike Lee Lee attempted to inject his well-trodden agenda into a World WarTwo drama.

1400052173|5.0|Just finished listening to the audio version of Skloot's book.  What a treat!      The history of the Lacks family reads like a Southern US version of Hundred Years of Solitude - the growth and demise of a town (Clover), poverty, incest (first order cousins), mental problems, exorcism, mad scientists too obsessed with  their work unknowingly hurting others.  The growing up of the Lacks children was sad, as if it was drawn directly from the Southern Gothic genre with kids being beaten and starved by their dad's (hinted at but unconfirmed) mistress and the mistress's husband sexually abusing one of the Lacks's kid...    In between that narrative the author discusses the sciences behind, ethics of informed consent in medical research (people were injected with HeLa - cancerous - cells without being informed), debate about the ownership of discarded body parts and the intellectual property of cells, large biological companies knocking out small government seed-funded laboratories, scientists who have to fund their frontier pushing research out of their own pocket for which they did not benefit monetarily, and Skloot's own surreal experience of tracking down the Lacks and the associated (some overly focused, or rather heartless) scientists.      It is a flawless book.  Skloot has done a great job.  More importantly, the Lacks have shown themselves to be very generous people time and again.  They have so much love for others and in particular Deborah's willingness and ability to forgive yet not forget is humbling.  Without their help a book as perfect as this cannot be written.  Five stars to Skloots and many many more to the Lacks family.
0307454541|3.0|Finished reading \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and have to say although there were parts I liked, that overall I was underwhelmed. I liked some of the characters including Salander but found myself saying \\"There are how many pages still left?\\" a couple times. Versus \\"The Shack\\" which I read in two days and thought was incredibly compelling and never dragged \\"GWTHDT\\" just didn't do much for me. I found it detailed to the point of not caring much of the time. Once the initial mystery was solved I wasn't shocked at what had happened to Harriet. Similar to how I felt after they found out who killed Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks. After that I just couldn't wait for it to be over and found myself wanting to skim a lot. I'm still going to give the second one a shot as some friends have told me it's better than the first but if I am not into that one in the first fifty pages I'm giving up.
0671015206|4.0|This book provides a look at America's millionaires that challenges common assumptions about what it looks like to be wealthy.  The authors seem to be well-suited for this task, having performed many years of research on marketing to the affluent, and providing consulting services on this subject to 7 of the top 10 financial services company.<br /><br />The ubiquitous theme of the book is frugality - Pay Yourself First, in the words of the book \\"The Richest Man in Babylon.\\"  If you always spend the money you make, you will never become wealthy, no matter how high your income!<br /><br />A few surprises:<br />- 80% of millionaires in America (as of the mid-90's) are first-generation millionaires - not children of affluent families.<br />- Millionaires are nearly always frugal, but are not nearly as price-sensitive when it comes to medical services, legal and tax advice, and their children's education.<br />- The typical millionaire's car is only 20% more expensive than the average American's car!<br /><br />The first half of the book is most broadly useful, giving a picture of typical millionaires, and explaining their lifestyle and mentality.  In the second half of the book, the authors focus on the cars and children of the wealthy.<br /><br />The book can get a little preachy.  By the end you may feel that if you ever own an expensive automobile, whether or not you can afford it, you aren't doing it right.  I would rather the authors recognized that everyone's priorities are different; some would rather spend on possessions and adventures to enjoy than aim for 10 million in net worth.<br /><br />On the whole, a worthwhile and decently fast read.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This is honestly one of his best works!!! every single song is so well thought out and put together. the beats are crazy good, choruses super catchy, and of course THE LYRICS ARE IMPOSSIBLY GENIUS.

0525421580|4.0|A great book, the two different writing styles of the different authors clash well. I finished it in about three days because i couldn't put it down.
0375842209|5.0|Yes, 5 stars, yet I am in agreement with many negative reviews: while I did not necessarily resent the choice of Death for the narrator, I did find that the author overreached a little on the \\"poetic\\" language.  It seems that the author is so desperately trying to avoid cliches, that some of his fresh turns of phrases and metaphors turn out too far fetched, and instead of being compelling and evocative, become puzzling and annoying...  I am not going to dwell on this point, since at least 2 or 3 negative reviews have made that point before me, but I wanted to acknowledge those reviews and say that I see their point even though I am recommending this book to a lot of my acquaintances.      The reason I give this book 5 stars nonetheless is because it is a touching story of true love (and by \\"true love\\" I do not mean the cheesy and melodramatic \\"Mr. Right\\" stuff that the romantic comedies tend to feed us, but the whole range of human relationships - love for parents, love for a husband or a wife, first love, love for neighbors and friends, etc.) and a much needed story that shows us the \\"German\\" side of WWII (the side that we do not often see in such details, it seems).      But above all, it is the cathartic quality of the end that captivated me.  I have not cried over a book like I cried over this one in a long long time.  Especially for a teen, I think this book is fantastic because it can teach the kids a thing or two about life, compassion and, well, again, love in a sense much different from what they often see on TV, in the movies, and in books like the hugely popular \\"Twilight\\".
0385523904|5.0|Whether you have an interest in world politics or just pick this book up for something different to read, you will not be disappointed. If you have a strong background in this area, you will find the factual information sound and the care with which the stories are fleshed out just perfect. If you know nothing about North Korea, you will soon care a lot about the people chronicled in this book, and the country as a whole.     I feel as if any review I write will not do this book justice. It is just amazing.
0743298039|3.0|Since every time you post a negative review on a book here, the people who loved it seem to make it their personal mission to tell you how stupid you are for not liking what they do, I'll start by saying that I did enjoy the book.  It is well-written, especially the beginning of it.  The language is delicious, the mood and atmosphere are very well defined, the characters are interesting.  But as the plot advanced, the book sort of fell apart, in my opinion.  One too many suicidal hermit males, one too many disturbed females, and many too many twins...  I understand that this is the name of the game for the genre, but I found it grossly overdone by the end.  It's as if Rochester turned out to have not just one crazy wife in the attic, but the whole harem.  Jane would still be a compelling character, and the story in and of itself would still be a literary treat, but wouldn't it make you raise your eye brows?    Personally, I enjoyed Margaret's thoughts on books and readings at the beginning of the novel far more than the shocking revelations and the hurried events in the end.      In conclusion - I would recommend this book to someone who enjoys gothic novels, who loves the novels by the Bronte sisters and enjoys reading anything reminiscent of them, or for someone who is looking for an entertaining book to read on a trip, but it did not quite make it to my personal list of books I'd recommend to just about anyone.

0756405890|1.0|[Some spoilers to follow.]    Nothing happens in this book.  That's the spoiler.  The story rambles for almost 700 pages and then stops.  That's it.  The main character, Kvothe, is completely ridiculous.  He's super strong, super smart, super talented, and all around super. His only flaw is that he sometimes forgets how super he is.  For example, he is often caught flat footed while distracted and not paying attention to his finely tuned sense of danger.     Because of a hopelessly contrived plot device, we know that this is the first installment in a trilogy, but if he isn't able to advance the plot in 700 pages, I can't image how painful 1400 more pages would be.  At least JK Rowling -- who he is clearly modeling big parts of this story on -- had the decency to give us a fully formed story within each book of her larger story.      I would strongly recommend that you spend your precious reading hours on something that rewards you with something -- a story, a memorable character, a laugh, anything.   This book does none of that.
B003LD9P4K|5.0|Comment: Usually I don't like old farts giving concerts that represents the music they were able to make when they were young. I usually don't get the same \\"vibe\\" because it isn't the same sound I remember... analog and distorted. This Blu-ray changes that by starting out moderately and building to a crescendo that if you can stand to raise your volume to  live concert levels (and your neighbors don't mind) you will get an experience that matches the concerts of younger days. The picture is stellar... giving you an up close and personal look at three aging rockers that can still knock your sox off! If you are a fan of EL&P... buy this Blu-ray.

0375421947|5.0|Some time ago, I read Edith Templeton's book \\" The Darts of Cupid\\".  Upon reviewing the book online a fellow reader recommended I check out her best work \\"Gordon\\".  Ms. Templeton was definitely unconventional and her stories I read were so original that I had to pick up on this recommendation and check out what her novel will be like.  I was not disappointed, and this must have been one of the best purchases I ever made.<br /><br />Book is about complicated relationship between a young woman and her lover who happens to be psychiatrist.  They meet by chance, in a London bar, shortly after WWII is over.  Young womand has left her husband and trying to find her way in a new post war world and her lover, Gordon, is using his professional skills to dominate her in every possible way.  Both of them feed on each other emotionally, sexually and develop strange dependency on each other. Their game drains and strengthens them both, and it is once in a lifetime experience for both.<br /><br />Book was banned in 1960s in Europe and yet it has found following in the underground distribution.  It is well written, sort of homage to both Goethe and psychoanalysis and deeply personal.  I cannot rememebr if I ever read any other work like this one and that is what excites me about this work.
B000089RVX|3.0|If there was ever a pretentious sub-genre of pop-rock, it was \\"Goth.\\"  At least \\"punk\\" knew what it was rebelling against, even if it had no reason to rebel; \\"Goth,\\" on the other hand, is totally misnamed and has no idea what it wants to be.  Amy Lee's band, however, is not truly \\"Goth,\\" although she certainly revels in the \\"Goth\\" motifs to create something rather new and different.    That is the true interest of \\"Fallen\\":  it is really something different from standard rock- or pop-fare.  The lyrics are highly thoughtful, smacking of depression and self-induced anguish and all the same a consciousness that something perhaps more beautiful lies above.  Notwithstanding Amy Lee's vehement insistence that she had never wanted this to be a \\"Christian band\\" (which, given the connotations therein, is totally understandable even to this practising Christian) this is quite possibly the story of a soul yearning for salvation.    Of course it is not \\"sacred music\\" and it would be totally unacceptable for a contemporary Christian label (the music under which, by the way, is most definitely not \\"sacred,\\" either, despite its pretensions to the contrary).  That is something else that makes this disc unique:  its expression of the anguish and frustrations of ordinary life against the promise of higher things.    Interestingly, the album's flatness, from a musical standpoint, is also revealing of just how shallow and pointless are personal anguishes against the backdrop of sacred majesty.  Musically, the disc is at its best when it borrows from classical or medieval motifs--a polyphonic choir can be heard singing \\"Servatis a periculo; servatis a malefico\\" (Thou savest from danger; thou savest from evil) on \\"Whisper\\"--as a nod to its \\"goth\\" aesthetic or to Lee's classical music training and when Lee's lyrics turn away from inner struggle and onto outward universal contemplations:  \\"Will I be denied Christ?\\" she asks in \\"Tourniquet,\\" meaning, of course, will she go to hell if she commits suicide.  \\"Hello?\\" is also good, as it keeps itself simple and personal without trying to stand up to great classics.    That this is a musically anemic piece of work should not surprise.  Musical anemia is an endemic fault in all rock groups, owing to the limited number of voices and limited singing range of those who do sing as well as the relatively few instruments and band members.  However, next to the classical motifs and the longing for medieval and baroque Christianity evinced in these tracks, the shallowness of the genre is all the more evident.  This is true of the lyrics as well:  the personal and temporal can never compare to the Divine and the eternal.  Amy Lee may have good taste, but so long as she is playing in the popular/rock genre her good taste will expose the inherent flaws of the genre and make her music look underdeveloped in comparison.  And that is why I docked two stars.    \\"Fallen\\" is worth a listen or two and (for a layman who does not hear confessions) is a good psychological case study of a tormented soul, but if you are looking for rich, deep music, check out [[ASIN:B000003CSU Vivaldi: The Four Seasons]]; if it's Christian music you are after, check out [[ASIN:B00000DU3N Missa Praeter Rerum Seriem]].

0061777250|5.0|It is difficult to understand how mainstream science can continue to ignore or reject the implications of the near-death experience (NDE) in light of the evidence and arguments made by Dr. Pim van Lommel in this most comprehensive book.  Dr. van Lommel seemingly touches all bases in exploring the various phenomena related to the NDE.<br /><br />  Having grown up in an academic environment, van Lommel, a world-renowned cardiologist practicing in The Netherlands, writes that he was of the reductionist and materialistic mindset before he began studying the NDE and the nature of consciousness.  He has closely examined all the arguments made by the scientific fundamentalists and now has a more positive outlook.  \\"That death is the end used to be my own belief,\\" he writes.  \\"But after many years of critical research into the stories of the NDErs, and after a careful exploration of current knowledge about brain function, consciousness, and some basic principles of quantum physics, my views have undergone a complete transformation.  As a doctor and researcher, I found the most significant finding to be the conclusion of one NDEr:  `Dead turned out to be not dead.'  I now see the continuity of our consciousness after the death of our physical body as a very real possibility.\\"<br /><br />  About the time I started reading this book, reports were appearing at various internet sites stating that there is now evidence that the NDE is nothing more than a brief spell of abnormal brain activity resulting from oxygen deficiency.  This theory has been going around for years, but seems to get resurrected every few years as if it is new science.  Van Lommel dismisses the theory, pointing out that the NDE is \\"accompanied by an enhanced and lucid consciousness with memories and because it can also be experienced under circumstances such as an imminent traffic accident or a depression, neither of which involves oxygen deficiency.\\"<br /><br />  Van Lommel also addresses the skeptic's theory about the tunnel effect reported by many NDErs being caused by the disruption of oxygen supply to the eye, which gradually darkens one's range of vision.  He points out that such a theory cannot explain the reports by NDErs that say that they meet deceased relatives in the tunnel.  He tells why carbon dioxide overload, various chemicals, and other physiological theories do not account for the NDE.  \\"When new ideas do not fit the generally accepted (materialist) paradigm, many scientists perceive them as a threat,\\" van Lommel writes.  \\"It is hardly surprising therefore that when empirical studies reveal new phenomena or facts that are inconsistent with the prevailing scientific paradigm, they are usually denied, suppressed, or even ridiculed.\\"<br /><br />  A chapter of the book is devoted to quantum theory, which includes non-locality, or the idea that the mind operates outside of time and space and that what we in the physical plane interpret as reality is not reality at all.  As van Lommel sees it, many aspects of the NDE correspond with or are analogous to some of the basic principles from quantum theory. \\"The findings of NDE research suggest the possibility that (nonlocal) consciousness is present at all time and will therefore last forever,\\" van Lommel offers.  \\"The content of a near-death experience suggests a continuity of consciousness that can be experienced independently of the body.\\"<br /><br />  Something I have found particularly troubling over the years is the possibility that organs are being harvested before bodies are actually \\"dead,\\" even though the person might be pronounced \\"clinically dead.\\"  Van Lommel devotes several interesting pages to the debate on this subject, pointing out that when brain death has been diagnosed, 96 percent of the body is still alive.  While not in principle opposed to organ transplants, van Lommel suggests that more consideration should be given to the nonphysical aspects of organ donation, including the fear of death.<br /><br />  Over the past 35 years, NDE researchers like Drs. Raymond Moody, Kenneth Ring, Michael Sabom, Bruce Greyson, Melvin Morse, and others have build a very solid wheel, one that supports the survival hypothesis.  Close-minded skeptics keep trying to make the wheel collapse by bending the spokes.  Fortunately, we have newer researchers like Drs. van Lommel and Jeffrey Long (\\"Evidence of the Afterlife\\") coming along to demonstrate that the spokes are solid and the wheel secure.<br /><br />  Over the past 35 years, NDE researchers like Drs.

0307266303|5.0|One of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time... while one gets the sense that McDougal takes a bit of poetic license and embellishes some aspects of the story, the story is entertaining and, more importantly, inspiring. As one who has generally only run when participating in sporting events or when being chased, this book has inspired me to rediscover the simple joy in running that I had lost long ago. Running can become more than just a means to other ends. Indeed it can be positively wonderful in itself, and McDougal has captured that wonderfully in this book!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|There is SO much to say about the Ka-Bar BK2, but I'll try to keep this short, sweet and to the point... no promises    First off, I need to say that the pictures that they show of the knife on Amazon.com aren't 100% accurate for this knife. The picture that they show is of the BK2 first edition. The knife that you will receive if you order one is slightly different, but in a good way in my opinion. The bottom of the handle in the picture shows that the handle material and the bottom of the knife are flush together, when in reality the knife you will receive has an extended tang that sticks out of the bottom of the handle by about 1/3 to 1/2 of an inch; This allows for the knife to be used as a chisel.    The BK2 is an absolute BEAST! You can put this knife through just about any torture test and it'll come out ready to kick Chuck Norris' butt. The blade is 1/4 of an inch thick which makes the entire knife feel sturdy and VERY hefty in your hand. The knife isn't a light one, but for camping or any other place you may need to chop wood, this knife will blow the competition out of the water. The BK2 is definitely more for brute jobs like chopping wood, cutting thick plastic or anything you would need a hatchet for. You can also use this knife as a chisel because of the extended handle that I mentioned earlier.    The handle of the BK2 feels just as solid as the blade of the knife. The handle is made of grivory. Grivory is a very hard material which feels a lot like the love child if glass-filled nylon and aluminum had a baby. If you take the two halves of the handle apart, you have a fairly good sized space inside of the handle in which you could store some small survival items like some fishing line and a few hooks. The handle has a very solid feel to the shape of it; while the handle isn't made of a very \\"grippy\\" material, the shape of this knife handle will make it pretty hard to slip out of your grip, wet or dry.    What better way to finish up a fantastic knife review than to tell you about the fantastic sheath that comes with the knife. The BK2 comes with an extremely well molded kydex sheath. (for those of you who don't like kydex, just ignore me while I gush over this sheath) It comes with many different customization options and places to wrap molle straps, paracord or other kinds of rope or material. Another plus to getting the newer generation model of this knife is that they improved not only the looks of the sheath, but also the functionality of it as well; The sheath now holds the knife in place extremely firmly, which is an area that they had problems with before with the earlier edition. The only downside to the sheath is the nylon strap that they used in order to attach it to your belt; The nylon strap loop is WAY to big. (this can be easily solved by stitching it together in the middle) There is even a section of the sheath that indents, making it possible to put something like a magnesium fire starter on it without interfering with the way the sheath fits snugly against your leg. The last thing that I love about the sheath is that it has a drain hole on the very bottom of the sheath, where the tip of the blade is, in order for water that may get inside of the sheath to drain out through.    All together, this is one of the finest, most durable and BEST knives that I've ever owned. You will be VERY hard pressed to find a better knife that can do what this knife does, take the abuse that this knife can and still be as affordable as it is. This knife is absolutely the best value if you're looking for a knife that can take a TON of abuse and still work just as well as the day you bought it!
B000001EYW|5.0|As a 17 year old listening to American radio I never had the chance to actually hear the Brothers as so many did in the early years of their career. I am however fortunate to have found their music. For this album to have done as poorly as it did...it's got the greatest music that I have ever heard.   Still Waters starts out with the crashing drums with bagpipes of Alone, Barry on the verses Robin on the choruses. And from there it only gets better.  The second track, I Surrender, is a perfect example of the famous Gibb harmonies. Starting A Cappella, it grows into a pop-rock type of song.  I Could Not Love You More was Barry's ballad off of the album, and it was a very good one! And the classical guitar in the background gave the song a very nice touch!  Still Waters Run Deep is my least favorite song on the album, but is still an amazing song! Nice harmonies with an awesome solo by Robin in the middle of the song.  My Lovers Prayer is one the gems from this album. An amazing love song sung by Barry with a solo by Robin, which added a nice touch to the song.  With My Eyes Closed is a hard song to review...It's got the harmonies that we all love. And then it's got some nice guitar in the background. At the end of the song you can hear Robin singing in the back, almost repeating what Barry sings.  Irresistible Force is a great Robin song with some of Kendall's best work on the guitar! Great guitar solo in the song!  Closer Than Close was Maurice's turn to NOT make a complete fool of himself! His voice was so rich on this piece. Definitely another gem on the album. This one could have easily been a number 1!  I Will starts off slowly with Robin's sweet voice and then evolves into some nice Harmonies, led of course by big brother Barry. Very nice song.  Obsessions is probably my favorite song on this album. Nice falsetto done by Barry with his full voice doing the harmonies. Very beautiful song!  Miracles Happen took a little while for me to get into...but I eventuallygot there. A boy's choir adds a nice touch to the song closer to the end. A very inspirational song.  And then there is Smoke And Mirrors. Another one starting with Robin singing and then growing into Barry taking over. But that's okay because the mix definitely works! Definitely a great rock-pop song!  If you're wise..You'll buy the Import that has Rings Around The Moon and Love Never Dies. Both songs that Robin sings the Verses and Barry does the Choruses. Both very amazing songs...and worth the few extra bucks!  Definitely a great album that any music fan should buy!
B001VNB54A|5.0|When I talked to a 1st and 4th Marine Division vet, the reason combat accounts are often vague became very clear to me: \\"At Saipan, we did a FOUR day assault, which was... the most...\\" - as he trailed off, I could see his mind discarding a succession of words, and his eyes welled with tears as each attempt took him further back to places he didn't want to go - \\"... INTENSE... experience\\".  His relief at finally finding that single word - finally free to pull away from the nightmares and resume his story - communicated volumes more to me than any mere adjective.    Very few units (never mind individuals) survived the entire Pacific war intact, and those who did can rarely afford to tell us much about it.  Thus, in lieu of a single narrative, the producers of \\"The Pacific\\" instead pieced together three stories which, taken together, span the experience of the 1st Marine Division throughout World War Two.  Leckie and Basilone's accounts cover Guadalcanal, Gloucester and leave in Australia while Sledge's account describes Peleliu and Okinawa, with flashes from Basilone describing life stateside and the landing at Iwo Jima.    Several negative early reviews suggest to me that understanding the brilliance of this miniseries requires patience.  Indeed, upon a first viewing, \\"The Pacific\\" may appear muddled and disjointed as it forcibly juxtaposes three very different story lines at contradictory moments of dramatic inertia.  There are two critical reasons for this.    One problem for the first five episodes is a matter of source material.  It is important to remember that \\"The Pacific\\" covers FOUR YEARS of warfare while \\"Band of Brothers\\" covers only one.  For veterans, the memory of earlier battles (such as Okinawa) tends to get obliterated by the searing intensity of late battles (such as Okinawa).  It would be much like trying to recall memories from childhood: you have isolated but extremely vivid scenes etched in your mind, but there is little rhyme or reason connecting them.  However, your more recent memories, especially when they are so wrenching, can be recalled almost to the day.    The second problem is that of recognizing characters, a issue shared by \\"Band of Brothers\\". Many scenes appear to read as, \\"Some random guy in a helmet tells us this and that\\".  These \\"guys in a helmet\\" are not only hard to identify in their combat gear, but also answer to a bewildering variety of names, nicknames, ranks and even rank slang.  However, as those who've come to admire the once nameless likes of Hoobler and Shifty from \\"Band of Brothers\\" can attest, none of these helmeted figures are as anonymous as they seem, and as viewers go back and review these once random snippets they will discover a wonderfully rich tapestry of personalities that teaches us how the barbarism of war affected these people and their relationships to each other.    No one demonstrates this growth better than Joe Mazzello (\\"Timmmy\\" from Jurassic Park), who's slight frame evolves Eugene Sledge from a kindly, quiet kid to a bitterly angry vet.  James B. Dale may lack the confrontational \\"bad boy\\" edge that Robert Leckie's character seems to call for, but his powerful innate decency radiates a layered and humane interpretation that's endlessly watchable.  The inner life of John Basilone is not as well known, leaving actor Jon Seda little choice but to play him as a somewhat generic hero for fear of disrespecting a Medal of Honor winner by ascribing motivations that may appear less than courageous.  However, Seda is an excellent ensemble actor, most notably developing wonderful romantic chemistry with Annie Parisse in the calm before the storm of Iwo Jima.  This actress is just one of the many outstanding co-stars who create memorable sub-plots as they effortlessly perform the period dialog that seems to elude just about every other WWII production.    The music is also unusual and daring.  Hans Zimmer's New Age sensibilities construct a distinctly Japanese dissonance of bells that quietly envelopes the fury of battle with an unsettling form of Zen that never competes with or interrupts the urgency of combat - quite unlike the standard pounding action score or screeching horror effects that seek to heighten violence in other films.  Zimmer also proves he's perfectly capable of writing more conventional title music that evokes a gushingly American sense of honor without ever falling back on snare drum cliches.  His title music retains the \\"Plaisir d'Amour\\" quote (sung by nuns in an Ardennes convent) and will occasionally replay \\"Band of Brothers\\" in its entirety for those listening carefully to background music in certain dialogs.    There are, of course, nitpicks, which are inevitable in a project of such massive scope: Leckie's romance central to Part 3 never ignites, American mortars seem to be more accurate than baseballs (even on the first shot), starving, shell-shocked Japanese are somehow perkier and better dressed than fully supplied Marines (or even Okinawan civilians) and the hasty exposition to Part 1 is quite awkward (yes, it's true that that the nation was gloomy, but it's difficult to imagine ANYONE - especially Chesty Puller - assuming the Japanese were on the verge of world conquest barely 3 weeks after Pearl Harbor!)  With that said, for every little thing \\"The Pacific\\" might get wrong, there is SO much more it gets right that there is little doubt that this series is now the definitive recreation of the Pacific conflict.    The latter episodes of \\"The Pacific\\" are saturated with intense action and contain some of the most disturbing scenes ever put in a war film, once again reminding me of that conversation with the veteran: \\"These are things that no human being can possibly deal with.  The only thing you can do is 'wall it out'.  Guys that couldn't wall it out - officers who were trained to cope by keeping things organized or artists who tried to cope by expressing themselves - these people simply couldn't handle it\\".  Even this man's tremendous skills, inherited from a lifetime in the backwoods, were of no comfort.  As a member of an elite recon unit, the Japanese would deliberately let his unit pass then ambush the main body behind him.  The number of times that he literally walked *through* the gunsights of hundreds of enemies - each CHOOSING to spare his life - was only one of an endless list of profoundly disturbing things he had to \\"wall out\\" just to survive another day... not to mention another year.    To quote the series:  \\"You can't dwell on it.  You can't dwell on any of it\\".    NOTE: To obtain honest and often intense Japanese accounts of the war, I suggest [[ASIN:0765616432 Senso: The Japanese Remember the Pacific War: Letters to the Editor of Asahi Shimbun]], where a newspaper column provided one of the few opportunities for participants to discuss their experiences on such a politically dangerous topic.
B000EXZI1O|5.0|For the few people that think this is a \\"Disco\\" album...You are wrong! This is just the Brothers doing what they thought was R&B.  This album deserved all of the credit that it got...And MORE!  I'm not going to tell you about the first three tracks becaus everybody in the world has heard them! But I will say that they all deserved that number one spot that they received!  Reaching out was one of the four slow songs on this album. Barry's falsetto was as rich on this song as all of the others. Very awesome song!  The title track, Spirits (Having Flown) is an amazing song with almost a \\"Tropical\\" feel to it. Starting out with some Bongos with some counting down done by Barry. I wouldn't say that the verses were slow...Just that the chorus is a lot faster! The last minute and a half of the song is just instrumental with the brothers \\"Scatting\\". Very nice arrangement with the flutes. Goosebumps!  Search, Find is a very nice dance track. By the time you're done with this song you'll be panting and Searching, Finding some water!!!  Stop (Think Again) is the one song on this album that I just don't listen to. A VERY slow song that just gets on my nerves. Although the falsetto is nice.   Living Together starts with something that sounds like a College Band playing at a Football game, until the strings come in at a very fast pace! This was one of the few songs that Robin has a chance to shine with HIS falsetto! Which is actually a very nice break from Barry's!  I'm Satisfied almost has a reggae feel to it. Sort of an off beat feeling song. And Barry really gets into this one with his high falsetto scream.  And finally, there is Until. A lovely song for you to relax after all of the dancing you just did to the other tracks. Barry singing in his full voice instead of his falsetto accompanied by the Electric Harpsicord. The last note of the song is actually, to me, what makes it so...Awesome...A very high note possibly the highest of his career!    This is a great album for Gibb fans and people that like to dance! Actually...I'll go as far as saying that this is just a great Album for anyone who appreciates music!
0061124265|3.0|I am a fan of Paulo Coelho and have read all but 1 of his books.  \\"Veronika Decides To Die\\" is a good book yet it doesn't compare to Paulo's other writings.  I would recommend reading it, but without the expectation of it being nearly as good as \\"The Alchemist,\\" \\"Brida,\\" or \\"The Devil and Miss Prym\\"  If you haven't read any of those books and your time is limited, don't waste your time with VDTD and read one of the others instead.
B0029LX2LC|5.0|What do I think of when I think of The Roots?: Original, talented, diverse, consistent, reliable. I've never disliked a Roots album, and this is no exception. How I Got Over exceeded my fairly high expectations--by alot.  This album stayed in for about 3 straight hours when I put it in my stereo, uninterrupted. Every song flows together, it's great.  There are many guest appearances on the album, they all do well, my favorites being Blu and Phonte from Little Brother/Foreign Exchange(great to hear him rapping again), also nice to hear from Dice Raw and Peedi Peedi. The lyrics on How I Got Over are great, with Black Thought having more conscious lyrics than ever, it seems.  The beats are really soulful and nice. Some of the beats I could just listen to all day, great blends of different instruments over drums from ?uestlove.   There aren't any filler tracks(like all Roots albums), and each track seems to be just as good as the last. I just love the vibe the album gives, and it's hard to stop listening to it, or skip a track.  My favorite tracks: Right On, Radio Daze, Now or Never, How I Got Over, Doin It Again....I loved em all except Walk Alone, Web 20/20, and Hustla. I liked all of those, but didn't love them.  Long live The Legendary Roots Crew!
B0030B621W|5.0|PLOT SPOILERS<br /><br />It was an excellent movie on all levels. There were some scientific stuff going on that was not brought out. Clones are not as good as the originals. They tend to have defects and die young. It is not a perfected science.<br /><br />In this movie we see some of the aspects incorporated but never stated: testing of the clone when revived and disposal after 3 years. Today we are speculating that He3 mining on the moon could produce fusion energy in the future. I believe that was what the mining operation was doing, although not much was stated. It has several similarities to 2001, most have been listed. The most important one was that this was not an unreasonable science fiction with a long list of impossibilities, but rather a work which keeps within the realm of science fact, the way Arthur would have wanted it.<br /><br />The idea that they made the computer similar to HAL 9000 is not unreasonable. In fact I fully expect any NASA computer with the capabilities of the HAL 9000 to be named the same after the fictional work. The only thing I would have changed in the movie would be to show a glimpse of Sam viewing 2001 while on the space station.
B003BVK36Q|4.0|A Most Wanted Man for me is one of Le Carre's most enjoyable books in quite a while. While it is typically dark in tone, without any of the moral clarity from his Cold War work where the dilemmas were much more individualized, the story unfolds in a way illuminates some of the worse aspects of the \\"War on Terror\\" while not being an utterly depressing experience. How he is able to shed light on the bureaucratic conduct of this so-called war while seeming true to its reality and still create an entertaining book is testament to Le Carre's on-going skill as a chronicler of the secret world.
B000I2J6K0|2.0|I did not like this video or workout at all.  It looks like a homemade video and made up as you go workout.  The part that includes the husband is also unmotivating because she bosses him around and he seems very uninterested.  There are better videos out there.  I recommend Lindsay Brin's Mom's into Fitness.

B001GKJ2DY|1.0|with exception of ABBA's music, everything else in the movie is bad. The acting is so bad, even from great actors, it is insulting. The production looks like low budget and shot on vacation. I expected much more.
0345457692|3.0|This is not a bad book, but it just didn't do it for me.   I remember first  reading Neuromancer, which has some similarities.  Somehow, that book  worked a lot better for me - although it was incoherent at points, the  futuristic technology drove the plot.  I felt that Altered Carbon was  not a very successful mashup of SF and hard boiled detective story.    The seams are just too visible here.

All the other bands that did not make it to the previous versions are NOT on here. I guess in order to see them you have to have a BLU-RAY player, which I don`t have, and in these tight times, do not plan to get.(In my opinion BLU-RAY is a waste of money, once you get used to it, you would`nt want to go back to standard, so your hooked on it and its higher prices). This is a NOT SO SPECIAL EDITION. How many years will it take before the regular people can have the full version. Maybe I`ll get the 50th anniversary version! PASSSSS!  \\"Hey You, Get Off Those Towers\\"
B002VPE1AW|3.0|\\"Avatar\\" is a magnificent technical achievement. The beauty and seamlessness of each scene is remarkable.  But the thing that make me want to see a  movie again and again is the writing.  Great writing is not altered by the passage of time. When a catch phrase is spoken in a favorite movie, it's as if I am hearing it for the FIRST time even as I joyfully say it along with the actor.  I do not find to be the case with \\"Avatar\\".  I don't think any of the lines were memorable and we have seen this story before.... many times. As one critic put it, it's \\"Dancing with wolves in outer space.\\"  Usually, when I buy a movie, I'll watch it 30 times. Not so with \\"Avatar\\"..... I watched it once.  I should have just rented it to see what the fuss was all about.
B00006FDCD|5.0|It (1990) is one of Stephen King's shining (no pun intended) moments. Of course, I'm talking about the book, but I'm also talking about the movie. I love the setting of the movie (New England) which is so common with King's works, but the New England setting works especially well in this movie. If Pennywise the clown were haunting and terrorizing a big city, it wouldn't have worked as well. When watching the movie, it slowly dawns on the viewer to ask, \\"Why here? Derry, Maine?\\" Actually, Derry is a town in New Hampshire, but King creates a Derry, Maine in this film. I think that the acting of Richard Thomas is superb, as he really brings out a character in distress at times. His stuttering adds a special chill to the scenes, as this was a part of his childhood, and took place the same time his young brother, Georgie was killed. The movie is long, but that's because it's really 2 movies in 1 (30 years ago), then onto the present time. I think that this works very well, and gives the viewer a good feel for what the kids went through in facing Pennywise. A few flashbacks wouldn't have worked as well. I'm glad that the makers of the movie decided to show how these kids developed into their adult selves, whether it was through abusive parents, or being the victims of harrassment from their peers. I think that Pennywise's appearances in the film are not too much or too little. I think that it's better to show the villain less than show it more. This way, it keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat, and creates a feeling of appreciation without wearing out \\"IT'S\\" welcome. The very beginning of the movie features a scene that is very similar to John Carpenter's Halloween, as Pennywise is behind hung clothes on a clothes line. This was the perfect intro to Pennywise, and gets into the psyche of the viewer right away. Overall, IT is a very good movie for the horror aficionado. The music is done very well, too. 9/10

B003QNXPUK|1.0|i just installed the Zagg InvisibleSHIELD for Apple iPhone 4 (Maximum Coverage) on my iPhone 4. it took about 20 minutes to get it on, and was a lot harder than i thought it would be. The pieces of film are quite floppy, so even if you do manage to get one corner on just right, your other corner has probably stuck on wrong, and you have to peel it off and try all over again. There was enough fluid to get the job done, but only if you're really careful. it may be a better idea to just pour it into a small container and dip the individual pieces in the liquid, or wet a paper towel with the liquid and then try to apply it. for a lot of the smaller pieces i didnt even bother spraying it. Another tip during installation is BE CAREFUL when putting on other pieces, as the pieces that have already been applied may not be fully adhered yet, so they could slip off if you rub the phone the wrong way. then you have to take it off, clean it, and reapply it. what a pain. anyways, now that it is fully installed, the front and back of my phone are covered in \\"micro bubbles\\" as Zagg calls them, however i thought micro stood for microscopic, and they are far from microscopic. anyways, when you actually activate the screen and use it in any way, you cant see the micro bubbles, so its not that big of a deal. in my opinion, the invisible shield doesn't take away from the beauty of the screen, although i do find the tactile response to be tremendously different. before, it was like sliding my finger across ice, and now its like sliding my finger across wax paper.    Update: about 2 hours after applying the invisible shield , I slid my phone across the taBle and the bCk part peeled right off rendering itself completely useless. Thanks for a worthless product that can't adhere to glass.
030726999X|5.0|...to finish this book it was really good even though, at times I almost wanted to not read anymore in the middle, but I stayed with it and so well worth it.<br />The series is well worth reading.  Lisbeth is my all time favorite character in fiction.<br />She's smart, she's odd looking, she doesn't take any crap from anyone and she's been thru<br />alot.  Anyone who has invested their time in reading the first two books will want to<br />continue on just for the satisfying ending of book three.<br />We will miss your writing, Stieg Larssen!!!
B003K07DUC|4.0|Cinematics first. Despite what others have said, I didn't find the moving camera distracting or nauseating -- and I am *extremely* prone to motion sickness. The movie was nicely paced, and the plot easy to follow. Neither Matt Damon nor Greg Kinnear gave stellar performances, but the Bourne Identity series wasn't great cinema either. If you want a fast-action thriller, you will enjoy this. It's a bit unlikely, as several have noted, but that's inherent in the genre.<br /><br />Politics last. I can't think why people have been getting so worked up over the film. It dealt rather straightforwardly with (1) the fact that no WMDs were ever found, (2) as most military and political analysts believe, it was a big mistake to disband the Iraqi armed forces, (3) the mainstream media rather uncritically joined the cheerleading for the war.<br /><br />The movie offers the uncontroversial proposition that the CIA screwed up, which is a conclusion reached even by the Bush administration and their supporters. The sole reference to Bush is the \\"Mission Accomplished\\" event that he himself staged. If the movie had suggested that Bush and/or Cheney knew that there were no WMDs (which I happen to personally believe), that *would* have been controversial. But it doesn't. So what's the beef?
B002VPE1X4|4.0|This Neoprene AmazonBasics Camera Case is designed for smaller digital point-and-shoot cameras and pocket video camcorders. The case easily fits my Fuji F200EXR camera (with an extra battery and memory card) or my Flip Ultra camcorder, but was way too big for the Flip Mino HD. Here are my observations:<br /><br />+ Well Made; good stitching and strong materials should hold up well<br />+ Good Design; the three pockets are easily accessible (the camera fits best in middle pocket)<br />+ Secure; good Velcro closures on the main flap and belt strap<br />+ Soft Material; will not likely scratch the exposed lens on my Flip Ultra<br />+ Good Value; good quality at a reasonable price<br /><br />The case can be carried by a Velcro secured belt loop or the removable wrist strap. My only real concern about this case is that if feels a little \\"floppy\\" when compared to my slightly more expensive [[ASIN:B00012FVYC Lowepro Rezo 30 (Black)]] (see picture in \\"Customer Images\\").<br /><br />This is a good choice for those needing a lightweight case for smaller cameras.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

0446567337|5.0|So i finished the book and saw the movie, and again, the book was the best. I must say that if you have a boyfriend or a husband in the army...maybe you shouldent read this book.    Almost everyone loves a great sappy love story,and Dear John is a bonus because it really gets to you. But even though i liked it, i had some problums with it too. Savanah loved John, she never stoped, so why would she marry someone else knowing John would eventuly come home? I'm not shallow and i have a boyfriend going into the Maries so i get the whole \\"Its hard because he might never come home\\" thing. But still i found Savanahs character to be totaly heartless. How could she do it? How could she love a guy and weight for years and then suddenly just send a letter saying shes marring someone else? She dident even TELL him it was TIM. I have sympathy towords Savanah, but at the same time i found myself boiling over her obvious disloyalty.

0375842209|5.0|Zusak, an Australian writer who grew up hearing stories of the Nazi years from his parents, has crafted a tale that focuses on the experience of Liesel and Rudy from their pre-teen years through early adolescence.  He does this, however, without minimizing the horrors that are part of the history of the era.  Liesel steals her first book--a gravedigger's manual--on the day her younger brother dies while the two of them are being taken by their mother to stay with foster parents outside Munich. We get only tantalizing hints about the reasons for the transfer, but it apparently has to do with communist sympathies (clearly on the part of their father, and possibly on the part of their mother as well).  We forget about that quickly, however, as Liesel gradually becomes part of the life of the poorer side of Molching, and particularly Himmel Street, where she lives with Hans and Rosa Hubermann.  Rosa is a grumpy, harsh woman who is constantly bad-mouthing both Hans and Liesel, though in the end we find that she has a soft heart and is dedicated to her husband and foster daughter.  Hans is a kindly house painter who plays the accordion and teaches Liesel to read.  The girl's series of book thefts--from her brother's graveside, from a Nazi book-burning, and most frequently from the library of the mayor's wife (often with the latter's connivance)--form the skeleton of the story.  On this frame, Zusak builds a story that is rich with unexpected imagery which serves to accentuate the emotional impact of the events.  Much of the character of Hans and Rosa (and Liesel) is revealed when they take in Max Vandenburg, a Jew from Stuttgart whose father knew Hans when they were soldiers together in World War I.  They hide Max in their basement, where he and Liesel develop a relationship that both complements and differs from her relationships with her foster parents.  Events unfold toward a conclusion that is perhaps inevitable given the historical events, but is painful nevertheless.  Zusak uses Death as the narrator, allowing him an omniscience that allows the novel at times to take a philosophical approach unavailable to any of its characters.  Death itself, however, is more than just a voice telling the story.  He is a character himself, trying to understand humans even as he carries their souls away from their lifeless and often shattered bodies.  I enjoyed the book very much.  The story itself is engaging and powerful, and Zusak has a knack for using unexpected juxtapositions of words, finding unique images, and effectively deploying small details in memorable ways.  His writing style is unlike any I have read, and while in some authors an unusual style can be annoying, calling attention to the style itself rather than the story, here it worked to set a tone that was somehow fitting for both the somberness of the overarching events and the emotional intensity of the particular experiences of Liesel Meminger and those around her.
0307588335|2.0|This book is not in the same league as the book \\"When Genius Failed\\".It is well written by Patrick Robinson but the content seems to leave alot of unanswered questions about how Lehman went down.It is more like an autobiography who the author seems constantly trying to inflate himself as a trader yet even if he was a great trader the facts as he presented them seemed not to make sense like why he did not bail out on Lehman with his friends and actually Lehman eventually pushed him out.My experience of financial companies,they do not get rid of money makers unless they commit a capital offence.The last chapters were slightly interesting but there was not enough of the book concentrating on actual fall of Lehman.If you like a book about someone giving their account of being a great trader at Lehman then it would be a bad buy but I am still looking for a book that gives me a good account of the events and causes of why Lehman went down.
B000002IM7|5.0|When this first album from the Texan trio KING'S X exploded out in the mid to late eighties it was like no other band around right then. It came with a sound and style that no band had been trying then, absolutely powerful and striking.   When all other bands around then were either like Bon Jovi or Motley Crue, with this they had huge heavy metal riffs slamming down next to beautiful harmonies and vocals extremely passionate and honest.   It may have dated a little, but on the whole, the album is still very contemporary sounding, elements of the best metal band sounds against amazing massive choruses similar to The Beatles. Just a really amazing uplifting heavy debut album.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is the third time in two years I've purchased this game.  Why so many?  The original game was purchased for school.  We had extra money to use for educational games, and Blokus jumped out at me, with its brightly colored box.  At first, the students weren't that interested (it's not electronic), so the teachers decided to tackle the game.  It  became an obsession.  In short time, students began to edge their way to a corner and take over the game.  Again, as much fun as this is to play, it's also a great way to get work from students before they sort out their pieces.  Bribe, you wonder?  Maybe.    What a fantastic way to think critically, offensively and defensively.  Blokus promotes planning and strategy in a fun and playful way.  It creates alliances \\"I won't corner you if you go in another direction.\\"  Players (kids especially) learn to handle confrontations when moves are in short order.      Blokus is not a game to gather dust in the back corner of a shelf.  It challenges players of all ages and levels.  Most surprisingly, the students who I thought would play easily (because of their scholastic abilities) were the ones who had to think hardest.  It's a great tool for geometry, spatial relationships, and artistic creations!

B0019N8P2W|5.0|Loved it.  Full of wit, sarcasm, humour, and that something from the 90's that just doesn't happen with teen shows these days... quality.    I used to wait for Daria to come on each week after school, so happy that I'd finally found a show where the kids actually questioned why things are the way they are; why the popular kids get special treatment, why it's considered weird to have an opinion, and why growing up can be hard sometimes.  Now that I have it on DVD, I can relive all the moments over and over!     For old fans like me, you will not be disappointed. Even though the original sound track had to be changed for copyright reasons, it's still got the attitude it had back then. There's over one hundred episodes to go through over the 5 seasons, plus loads of extras to play with, like episode intro's, original character sketches, and two movies; \\"Is it Fall Yet?\\" and \\"Is it College Yet?\\".    As for newcomers to Daria, if you love alternative views on society combined with teen angst and animation, you also will not be let down. It's as relevant today as it was in the 90's.    A great series, definitely worth buying in my opinion!
B003A4IFGY|3.0|Most reviewers seem to either love or loathe this album, but as a long-time Petty fan, I find \\"Mojo\\" to be an offering that falls in between the two extremes.  On the one hand, it does not come anywhere close to scaling the epic heights of vintage Petty offerings like \\"Torpedoes,\\" \\"Promises,\\" or \\"Long After Dark\\"--or even of very solid recent works like \\"Echo\\" or \\"Last DJ\\" for that matter--but on the other hand, it is not as mechanical and shallow as such Jeff Lynne influenced albums as \\"Full Moon\\" and \\"Great Wide Open\\" tend to be in spots.  (Sorry, but there are plenty of old school Petty fans who feel that Jeff Lynne sucked a lot of the soul and vitriol out of this once killer rock band . . . including original Heartbreakers drummer Stan Lynch, who left soon after \\"Great Wide Open\\" because he didn't want to be reduced to, as he put it, a \\"living drum machine\\").  So, there are no tunes on this new album that rival the musical and lyrical gravitas of the impeccable \\"Straight Into Darkness,\\" but there are also no songs that have the vapid lyrics and robotic production of \\"Yer So Bad.\\"  Real Petty fans should have his whole catalogue, so if you go way back, don't hesitate on this one . . . just don't expect a classic.
0312570740|1.0|Ammann's book on Marc Rich is essentially a wildly sycophantic PR effort, which attempts to compensate for what Ammann asserts as Rich's \\"PR advisers [having] not kept up with the times\\" (p. 139).    Straying more than a bit from pure `business journalism', Ammann at one point oddly fetes Rich with: \\"At seventy-four, Rich still exhibits the handsome features that made him such a good-looking man in his younger years.  Once can see a strong resemblance to Rudolph Valentino [!!!!], the tragic star of the silent film era, in Rich's earlier photographs\\" (p.144).    The book contains countless factual errors regarding governments, regions and leaders of the world that traded with Rich.  This work doesn't reveal the \\"hows\\" of Rich's methods so much as the \\"whys\\", all the while drawing an unnecessary mystique around Rich, his colleagues and enablers, and the state of commodity-backed global fiscal corruption in general.    Ammann maliciously labels Iran - which Marc Rich utilized under two regimes to build his oil trading wealth on - as an \\"anti-Semitic regime\\" that's hell-bent on destroying Israel, despite A) continued dealings between Iran and both Marc Rich & Co. then, as well as its current Swiss manifestation, Glencore, now; and B) tens of thousands of Jews living there for millennia without the kinds of pogroms or genocide insinuated by this agenda-ridden author.    As other reviewers also pointed out, Ammann treacherously floats that anti-Semitism drove the US prosecutor's legal campaign against Marc Rich. The author nonchalantly does so by having Rich confirm that such is the case, only to then include a brief, terse response from Sandy Weinberg in firm rebuttal as the end of it.  This is gutter journalism at its worst.    Ammann lacks the legal background to lend credible analysis to the legal case against Rich, but doesn't let that stop him from trying to perceptually vindicate Rich nonetheless.  He does so with essentially delayed caveats from some Ivy League tax law professors and Rich's own counsel, while in large part painting Rich as a wronged hard working immigrant who fled the Holocaust with nothing.  The US prosecution team is painted as inept, even oafish amateurs with a clear axe to grind against a hardworking, focused, discreet, rich Jewish émigré.     Applying appalling reasoning, Ammann offers that \\"[i]f we are to follow the time-honored American tradition of `innocent until proven guilty', then Rich must be considered innocent.\\"  This, just after conceding that Rich's \\"case never had the opportunity to go to trial, as Rich never returned to the United States.\\"      Brilliant.      It's the equivalent of claiming that, technically film director Roman Polanski - another fugitive who fled US law - must also be considered innocent because, technically, he was never formally convicted.    Ammann further blatantly contradicts himself in reviewing the US legal case against Rich.  In one instance, he claims: \\"It is the purpose of this book not to prove Rich's guilt or innocence but to pose questions and to point out the mistakes made throughout the entire affair by all sides\\" (p. 134).  A mere seven pages later, however, Ammann proclaims: \\"Yet I am not convinced that Rich would actually have been found guilty in court.  There is simply too much reasonable doubt surrounding his guilt.  I have come to this decision after my conversations with members of the judiciary, diplomats, and other individuals directly involved in the case and after having viewed countless documents, some of which were confidential\\" [confidential to whom, exactly?!?].  Again, Ammann is not an attorney, but a Swiss-born and based journalist.    Additionally, Ammann fails to point out a core contradiction in Rich's statements versus Rich's behavior.  At one point, Rich justified his dealings with Iran, Cuba and other red-flagged states with: \\"Business has nothing to do with politics\\" and \\"I'm not a political person.  We were not a political company\\" and still \\"[b]usiness is neutral. You can't run a trading company based on sympathies.\\"  All of that said, Rich nonetheless contributed generously to the Israeli state and her intelligence imperatives as a key, deep-pocketed \\"sayan\\", and was gratuitously acknowledged/rewarded for doing so by leading Israeli politicians and military leaders.     These same leaders lobbied Bill Clinton personally and directly to pardon Rich - an illustrated process that remains the most telling content of the book.    Also, and despite his apparently matchless level of access, Ammann did not provide enough detail on Rich's companies' operations, nor on the global energy and commodity sector mechanisms that allowed for Rich to operate so fluidly.  The book could've dwelled less on the cult-of-personality surrounding its subject, his colleagues and allies, and more on the vital issues involving the core commodity listed in the book's hubristic title.    Ultimately, Ammann did not write this book for the wider public, for aspiring business people, for Rich's progeny, or certainly for anyone curious about Rich's legal case.  He wrote it as an act of genuflection towards the elite, who he certainly had unique access to and utilized in order to `re-brand' Marc Rich whilst nodding and winking at the wider, opaque global realm of commodity and currency trading he claims Rich invented in large part.
0307454541|2.0|I suppose this novel would classify as a mystery, of sorts. Though, there are truly 2 stories in one (perhaps more??), and an entire host of characters that really never develop into anything of interest. With the possible exception of Lisbeth Salander, the \\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.\\"<br /><br />Mikael Bloomkvist, a financial journalist of sorts, has just been convicted of libel and is looking to serve time. He receives an offer from a wealthy industrialist - the patriarch of the Vanger family - to research a \\"whodunit\\" of the death of his favorite neice 40 years prior. This serves as a reason for Bloomkvist to escape scrutiny of Stockholm and to re-coup. Along the way, we meet Salander, a rather strange character, who has been a ward of the state since she was quite young, and who makes her way in the world by doing extensive background checks on people for a security firm. (That cannot seem to figure out she is a computer hacker - so much for security. Huh.)<br /><br />This novel has overly long, descriptive passages that really serve no purpose whatsoever. I felt as though I was watching one of those dreary, boring foreign films that show tons of scenery and people doing things in the hopes that it evokes some type of feeling that it never truly evokes.

And he is almost the total focus of the 600 pages of this book. Bleh!<br /><br />I was expecting so much from this, and I was disappointed in so many ways.

JUST SHUT UP!!\\" Yes, as you can see, I was faintly annoyed with this book and for quite a good reason; Dexter's insistent narrations on how he operates. Not that Dexter is a bad character, in fact he's quite fun to read along with, but at a certain point he becomes much too condescending, nearly narcissistic (Oh, forgive me Dex. You don't care much about yourself in that way. You've only said that FIFTY times), and flat out boring. However, it can be quite comical in some ways, but sifting through five pages of internal monologue on why he is who he is will cause people to start skipping lines; especially when he repeats himself. This was definitely much more tolerable in the television show as it wasn't nearly as overbearing, and used sparsely when compared to the book.       With that rant of criticism out of the way, the book can be quite charming in a diabolical way. Dexter struggling with his relationship with Rita, while trying to keep the sex hungry Laguerta away are just as fun to read as they are to watch. Deborah is infinitely more bad ass in prose form, and her conversations with Dexter are the highlights of this tale. In fact, when the characters are having conversations with each other, or Dexter is musing over their interactions is where this book best succeeds. Yet, again, fun as these side characters may be, they are not examined as they were in the show, and thus lose much of their interesting qualities (especially in the cases of Rita, Angel and Masuda). Despite this the mystery of who this dastardly serial killer is makes for an engrossing read merely on the audacity of the way the crimes are committed. While veteran's of the tv series may already know who the ice truck killeris, this version goes in a completely different direction which actually works out marginally better.      In the end my excitement for this book dwindled about half way through. Sure Dexter is a great character, and the dialouge is fun, but the creators of the tv series had a greater grasp on the subtleties of our devilishly, dashing, Dexter more than Jeff Lindsay does--A slap in the face to him as he, well, created him in the first place.
6305078181|5.0|I was skeptical at first cause I read several reviews that put this remake of the film down but you have to look beyond that cause the movie is still the same. Its a great movie, and Frank Langella plays the best Dracula ever in my opinion. The girls will melt over Dracula.  Gary O. Jones of Tehachapi
B0025KW29U|5.0|Very funny. Very well acted. Very exciting in terms of directing. Very Berry Sundae, and most importantly, I thought that the character archetypes ring true between any social, policital, and geographical boundries.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|Writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse have a gift - they have a talent for creating highly-intriguing mysteries and compelling characters. The problem? The ability to generate compelling storylines is their ONLY gift - they lack the talent to resolve them in a coherent or satisfactory manner, making them poor/mediocre writers as opposed to excellent ones. The promos for season 6 promised that \\"The answers are coming\\". Unfortunately ABC and Darlton weren't on the same page, seeing as there were no answers. So what did the writers do? Backtrack and backpedal: \\"Actually, the show was always about the characters\\". Right. Most of the characters, who at one time had been complex and compelling, had sadly been reduced to two-dimensional stick-figures, cardboard cutouts of their former selves by the end of the show. The beautifully-filmed, yet heavy-handed and emotionally-manipulative season finale seems to have redeemed the series' weakest season in the eyes of many, as was intended - by appealing to the hearts of the audience, the writers hoped to silence the head and blind the viewers to the many glaring plotholes and loose-ends present in their story. Uncover your eyes, ladies and gents - the emperor wears no clothes.
0439023483|5.0|A futuristic story of teenagers forced or compelled to fight one-another in a government controlled environment.  With a small love-story evolving in the mix with trying to stay alive.  The story moved along well and the ending a continuation - leaving me anxious to pick up the second volume.
1423113381|5.0|My 11yr old daughter just loves this book!  We had to go in and turn off her lights and take away the book, she would have stayed up all night to finish it!  We've really enjoyed all the books by Rick Riordan.
0060245867|5.0|I purchased this book for our grandson. He thinks it is great and it has become his favorite book.
1423101472|5.0|Again Rick Riordan has a hit!  My 11yr old will stay up all night reading his books if we let her, we actually have to go in and take away the book so she'll get some sleep!  This is a great book for boys and girls.  I'd highly recommend all of his books!
B002ZG97RY|1.0|No need to comment on the texture of the transfer or the sound; this is just another Hollywood example of getting another dig at President Bush.  The script looked like it could have been written by that flunkey of our present President.  Damon's acting?  Didn't the armed forces learn some martial arts?  He looked like a mountain man wrestling with a bear.<br /><br />If the liberals want to make a point, do it without me wasting $4.99.  I'm still waiting for Hollywood to make a movie out of that glorious Jimmy Carter rescue or Clinton's attack on a small place to divert attention from his affairs and possible impeachment.  So glad I didn't buy this video (btw, the grainy texture was terrible).<br /><br />WMDs?  Not finding does mean non-existent.  I've never seen a polar bear with my own two eyes, but I'm sure they're there nonetheless. We took out a dictator, and now the people in Iraq have a say over their own lives.  Why don't you show that, Hollywood?
B0015DROBO|5.0|Excellent read. Very gripping. Could not keep it down when I started reading it.Each character is introduced, built up and explained in a beautiful way. Cant wait to read the remaining book of this series!
B00133KFGW|5.0|Very touching movie, the music is great. the melody stays in your head. I loved   it and have watched it numerous times. My granddaughter is 12 years old and she loved it as well.   2 thumbs up on this movie.And the little girl who sang was outstanding. Her voice was beautiful.
B002U33GUQ|5.0|I ordered a copy of the Highway Rider CD. That's what I got. It was unopened, just as I was told it would be.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I love the opening of this film.  The first scene will hook you into watching the rest of the movie.  It is so different from your common magician movie and it has a wonderful love story to boot.<br />There is enough illusion to keep you trying to figure out how he does the tricks, but after awhile you don't even care how it's done as the story becomes more important.<br />Get it and watch it!  You will love it!
B002MFU9BG|4.0|Don't let anything fool you about the appearance of this album....this is James Brown and George Clinton inspired funk. It isn't the same as either of those guys but keeps the same hard driving beat and moves it forward into the 21st century. Many people will call this R&B but unless you're talking about the 60's when Staxx Records and Motown were called R&B you're in the wrong category. Funk is what this is and rocks the funk out.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|We all have different sense of humors, but I can guarantee you, by watching this series you are going to have some really good laughs, no matter what mood, or day you have had. My daughter who is 16yoa is not able to get enough of Jeeves and Wooster. She finished watching the series before we did! and she has watched it again with us! This has become one of our favorites. Please, give it a try.
B000PC8AFU|4.0|There really isn't anything on this album that will blow you away and if you are a huge SRV fan then you probably already have most of these tracks on other albums. The main thing that this album does it put them all together on one single disc for you to have instead of trying to carry around 4 or 5 other albums with you. So, unless you are a diehard SRV fan you might want to just hold off on getting this album because you will probably be disappointed by the fact you already have these songs.
0446698342|5.0|This is the fourth of his books that I have read.  Great love story. The ending doesn't exactly \\"WOW\\" you but its good reading material.
1401201911|5.0|To preface this I'm just going to say that I often find Mark Miller, though I don't know him personally, to be a self-aggrandizing prick. That being said the man does know how to tell a story and I suppose it isn't bragging if you can back it up. This story is more or less and 'Elseworlds' story and imagines what if Superman's rocket had been 12 hrs earlier or later and landed in rural Soviet Union instead of rural Kansas. Now Josef Stalin has his 'Man of Steel' and uber-mensch to show off how communism is the best political form of government. There is also Batman who is Russian for the purposes of the story trying to pry the country out from under the steel-fisted grip of the Last Son of Krypton because he has become a Fascist. Lex Luthor becomes the American president, married to Lois Lane, and is still trying to destroy Superman but this time for the good of the country and the world not wanting to become a vassal nation to the Soviet Union. Green Lantern also makes an appearance. This story is wide spread and utterly fantastic and if you like comics or great stories told well then this is a must read.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|If you love Dr Who, this is a must have.  Very well written storylines, beautifully done.
B000HEZF0O|5.0|I have always liked action movies but this series is one of the best!!  Lets hope that someday we will see an MI-4
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Eminem is the Greatest Recording Artist!!!! His music is undeniable the BEST!!! I have been a fan since the beginning of his career and will always be. Now, this album is so diverse and I am so glad that he did take this route. I rate all of Eminems Albums a Five because they are non-the-less! No one and I mean No one can tell stories like Em has done over these 10 years Mainstream! This album has it all! Stories, beats, and lyrical content that cant be match. Honestly the best 2 albums that came out this year so far is B.O.B and Eminem!!! Real talk!! Eminems albums are unique. Every single one was pure music and you can see how he has evolved. Passion is in every one especially this one! Recovery has the most! I will point this out, even though he said Encore and Relapse wasn't all that great, I believe that they are on the pedestal with his other albums.
B0030Y11O2|5.0|A must see documentary.  This film is a real eye opener on this countrys financial system.  From the stock market to credit systems, you get to see how corrupt the industry is and how big business really runs this country.  I'm sticking with good old cash for everything.
B000JU7NCE|3.0|Bit of a comedown vs. \\"Trilogy\\" and \\"Orange.\\" Seems like Bob and the boys got a bit too carried away with optical effects. Way over-produced! These \\"cheesy\\" rock-video gimmicks in combination with too much crowd noise really took away from the music. The music incidentally is just fine. Nothing great though. So..worth getting? Well, your life would be complete without this DVD. If you can get a good deal on one get it - especially if you're a real fan. Wouldn't pay list for it though.     BTW, you can find DVDs of \\"Orange\\" if you Google it and look carefully. Some Internet \\"entrepreneurs\\" sell it for $10 or $20. And worth every penny. Quality of them - at least the one I got - was superb - as is the music and production.
B000002TYX|4.0|Released in conjunction with the ABC-TV documentary, these previously unissued recordings capture the Beatles on a voyage and working diligently on a formula to change the world of modern music forever. By the time they appear on Ed Sullivan's show, game over. They conquered the youth and some adults. Existing rules were laid to rest.<br /><br />The chronology makes sense. All of the live recordings are a valuable addition to their legacy, especially the 1963 recordings in Sweden. When John sings a fervid \\"Money\\" with pared-down backing, he(they) prefigure punk by at least three years. They're still starving artists. The sardonic wit that introduces a few of the numbers is priceless, especially John's intro to a great \\"Twist and Shout\\". And their hilarious skit that segues into a mash-like \\"Moonlight Bay\\" is a hidden classic. Beyond the live material, you get a great Pete Best-era instrumental, \\"Cry For A Shadow\\". There's a rollicking take of \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" that I may even prefer to the original. But most welcome of all is that killer version of the long-bootlegged \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\", which should have nudged off \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" in contention for a slot on \\"Beatles '65\\" or \\"Beatles For Sale\\" in the first place.<br /><br />There's peripheral stuff included here to be sure. The Decca audition is lackluster. The primitive home demos, like that of \\"In Spite Of All Danger\\" and the false starts to say \\"No Reply\\" work strictly as historical artifacts, but they don't hold up to repeated scrutiny. Taken as a whole, this can be an audio delight in low doses. Recommended unequivocally to completists but for the casual listener get their core catalogue first. ***1/2 stars<br /><br />P.S. Get the must own Beatles Anthology DVD. *****
0375836675|4.0|A little over three years ago I decided to try my first Markus Zusak book. I had heard everyone and their grandmother go on about what an amazing accomplishment his later novel [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]] was, so naturally I walked right past that one in the bookstore and grabbed a copy of I AM THE MESSENGER. Will I never stop being so obstinate when it comes to hype? But in this case, though, I have to say I'm sort of glad I read this book first. It's just so freaking unique. And hilarious. And moving. And that is not to say that [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]] isn't all those things and more. Because it is. And let it be known that I think it is a perfect piece of literature and I love it with every fiber of my bookish being. But today I want to talk about his earlier book. The one I read first. The one that introduced me to the wonder that is Markus Zusak's gift with the written word. And the one I think fewer people have read, which is a problem that must be rectified at once. Today, if possible! Originally published back in 2003 in Australia as THE MESSENGER (a title I like almost as well), this remarkable novel has been the lucky recipient of several awesome covers as well as the Children's Book Council Book of the Year award (for older readers) in Australia and the Printz Honor here in the states. And I promise you two things. You have never read anything like it. And you do not want to miss it.<br /><br />Ed Kennedy is the most underachieving 19-year-old cab driver you'll ever meet. He lives in a dump of an apartment with his atrociously lovable dog the Doorman, who is--among other things--a diehard coffee slurper. And Ed spends his days driving cabs and mooning over his fried Audrey, and his nights playing poker poorly with his best mates Marv, Ritchie, and Audrey. Then one day Ed does something unusual. He stops a bank robbery in progress and barely escapes with his life. A short while later, cards are delivered to him. Playing cards. All aces. One by one, they appear in his path. One by one, they change his life. For with each ace comes a message that needs to be delivered and Ed--poor, average, no expectations Ed--is the messenger. The messages drag him around the city, searching for their chosen recipients. Ed stumbles along in his role and receives a heady and shocking glimpse into the lives of the people living around him every day. Sometimes he's bringing comfort. Sometimes a warning. And sometimes he is the punisher. Finding it difficult to cope with the weight of his sudden, unwelcome responsibility, Ed turns to his longtime friends for support. But even they, after awhile, are unable to truly understand what he's going through. And Ed becomes inevitably obsessed with finding out who is sending the aces, who is behind the strange and prescient messages, and--most of all--why they've chosen him to be their messenger.<br /><br />I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning finishing this book the first time. On the cold tiles of the bathroom floor I sat, knees drawn up to my chest, absolutely frozen with my sympathy for the characters and my need to know how it would all turn out. Zusak blew me away. It's just that the words were always right. A good story, great characters, it's not enough. The individual words have to be right. And not even just good words. The best ones for the job. Zusak has this talent in spades (no pun intended). A good early passage:<br /><br />***<br /><br />\\"It's just . . . I wish it was easier, for me, you know?\\" I make a special point not to look at her. \\"I wish it was someone else who was chosen for this. Someone competent. If only I didn't stop that robbery. I wish I didn't have to go through with it all.\\" It comes gushing out, with words like spilled milk. \\"And I wish it was me with you and not that other guy. I wish it was my own skin touching with yours . . .\\"<br /><br />And there you have it.<br /><br />Stupidity in its purest form.<br /><br />\\"Oh, Ed.\\" Audrey looksaway. \\"Oh, Ed.\\"<br /><br />Our feet dangle.<br /><br />I watch them, and I watch the jeans on Audrey's legs.<br /><br />We only sit there now.<br /><br />Audrey and me.<br /><br />And discomfort.<br /><br />Squeezed in, between us.<br /><br />She soon says, \\"You're my best friend, Ed.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know.\\"<br /><br />You can kill a man with those words.<br /><br />No gun.<br /><br />No bullets.<br /><br />Just words and a girl.<br /><br />***<br /><br />As you can tell, I was really struck with Ed and Audrey's complicated and often painful, but always true, relationship. I love Ed. I love Audrey and Marv and Ritchie. And I freaking love the way the language wrapped itself around me and made me laugh and cry and gasp. This book isn't just a story. It's a comprehensive experience. I felt better the next morning. Like the world was brighter, more vivid. I inhaled this book, but it swallowed me. I imagine Mr. Zusak would be pleased with that result.hem, and I watch the jeans on Audrey's legs.     We only sit there now.     Audrey and me.     And discomfort.     Squeezed in, between us.

B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This is the second set of Duplo blocks I've bought for my 1 and 2 year old grand daughters and they love them.  The pieces are easy for their little hands to handle and they are large enough so they don't get swallowed accidently.  I'd highly recommend the Duplo brand products for anyone with children under 3 years of age.
B001FB5634|5.0|Many reviews below have complained about the unreality of the high level of cannibalism this film depicts. The story takes place a little more than ten years after an unnamed world apocalypse. ALL vegetation is dead; there are no crops, and none can be grown. All animals are dead. There is no electricity. Got it? Every item in every grocery store would have been depleted within a year after the apocalypse. Items requiring refrigeration would have spoiled within a week. THERE IS NO FOOD LEFT....except for the only surviving animal.....man. In such a situation, your choice would be to either die of starvation, or eat the only thing left to eat. End of cannibalism discussion. As stated numerous times, this film does depict the bleakest, most despair-filled scenario I've seen. It is VERY distressing, but it is also extremely thought-provoking. I don't think anyone could watch this film without thinking of themselves and their families in a similar situation. On the surface, the hopelessness for existing is engulfing. Yet, we are shown one man's determination to protect his young son from the bleakest of circumstances, and the consuming love of parent for child. THAT is the story as it takes place on \\"the road\\" south. One reviewer balked at the idiocy of father and child leaving the only hidden food source they find. That reviewer must have forgotten the importance of the trip down \\"the road\\" to the south. Without electricity, they could not survive another winter where they were. So, taking as much food as they can, they continue on. All along their trip, they encounter the horrors of starving people searching for ANYTHING (them) to eat. There are several situations that made me recoil in abject sadness, and unnerving understanding. Yet, throughout, the father's love and protectiveness is top priority. The acting of father and son, Viggo Mortenson and Kodi Smit-McPhee is absolute perfection! I was moved to tears more than once by the son's performance! Considering the darkness of the story, the ending gave a much-needed lift that despite the animal humans can become under such situations, there will still be goodness and hope for a better tomorrow. This film is definitely not everyone's cup of tea - not everyone LIKES tea! But, for the performances, and a profound thought-provoking experience, I would definitely recommend the film to be seen.
0446567337|5.0|..This book is marvelous, not Only it gave a lesson to keep me Closer to my Father, but also it gave the courage to live with a broken heart, and to still have hope, even in the toughtest momments, every chapter was precious and even tearing, this is<br /><br />A MUST READ BOOK!.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Feel good musical looked and sounded great on my Samsung HDTV when I rented it from Netflix.  Couldn't pass up the great deal I got on this 2-disc special edition in the Amazon Marketplace, so added it to my collection.
0446560065|5.0|As a fan of the Simon's Cat short animated videos on YouTube, I was happy to see this book offered on Amazon.  I received it in excellent shape in a very timely manner after ordering it.  The book is great fun, lots of single frame cartoons that are so spot-on concerning how cats behave.  Great book.
B00008G8M4|5.0|I received this product faster than I had expected in excellent condition. I would recommend this supplier and will look for them again in the furture for more purchases.
B0019N8P2W|1.0|This is still one of my favorite animated shows of all time.  In fact I am watching it right now.  Fortunately I am watching with the original music in tact.  I have had a home made DVD collection for a while now and was so excited when I heard that it was being released in DVD quality.  I was disappointed though when I read that the fantastic music of the 90's would not be included.  Why would the artists not want their songs to live on through one of the most beloved clever series of our generation?  Although I would love to own this box set I would rather it be in its entirety.  Eventually they will release a \\"directors cut\\" or what have you. If they are smart that is.  As my title says I am holding out.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|watched when it was on tv but still get pumped up every episode i watch.
0307454541|2.0|The positive for this book is the protagonist, Lisbeth. She is original and drives the story forward. But the big negative is the violence. It's sick, and I didn't need to read this. The movie, which I saw afterward, is better than the book as Lisbeth is more fleshed out and we are spared the gruesome descriptions of the violence. Also, the book is not particularly well-written. It needed an editor to eliminate 15-20%.
B0012GMY64|5.0|These songs showcase Andy Williams voice better than any I've ever heard, other than his Christmas Album.  Andy is up there with Perry Como and Dean Martin, voice wise, and these are the songs that will leave you saying 'they don't make singers like that any more' and other things to cause your kids to roll their eyes and shake their head at you...but it's true, they don't.
B003LFLOOW|2.0|Honestly there is not much to say about it. I think that visually and in a way \\"spiritually\\" the film was beautiful. But the story was one and the same - Godless jaded humans destroying everything for money and resources as it has always done - and one guy chooses to see the other side and fight for them. It's very Dances with Wolves, Last of the Mohicans, The Last Samurai, The Mission - you name it, it's been done before. Only I think Avatar made it worst - because all it did is focus on war on both ends. How about a little more cultural writing eh? We learned nothing about those \\"people\\" other than they could fly and hunt, sing and pray really well.<br /><br />The technology in this film is kick ass though. One of the things I found funny is that with all that \\"technology\\" for the characters (not the technology used in the film) they couldn't give the dude a more state of the art wheel chair?<br /><br />And would it have killed the writers to add some more evolved lines and characters: \\"choose a woman\\" Seriously? Grow the hell up boys.<br /><br />At least Sam Worthington was not nearly as bad as I thought he was going to be. I refused to see this film in the theaters and frankly I don't regret it. I don't think I missed much.<br /><br />And stop killing Anna Lucia LOL.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|After listinging to his songs on YouTube for a while, I finally just went to Amazon and bought it.  All of the songs are very good quality-wise, but this has some of the greats like You Don't Love Me, Born to Lose, I Can't Stop Loving You, Take These Chains From My Heart and Bye Bye Love. All recorded at what sounded like the peak of his voice. I thought his voice got better in some ways as he got older, like 'Song For You' (Not on this album) was a later song and was stylistically among the best recordings of that song. But these are all, I think, perfectly composed songs at just the right time in his career. My all time favorite Ray Charles song is You Don't Love Me and the version on this album is the best I've heard.
B003I64748|4.0|This review is about the actual record set not the music.     The vinyl comes as 3 LP set, each LP is 180 grams, very nice indeed. Sound quality is excellent as you would expect. My only complaint is the cover is not a gatefold or a record book like the Back To Basics set it is a very simple, thin single sleeve with all 3 records inside, each in it's own plain white paper sleeve.     There are 2 LP sized images included inside, I had heard these referred to as lithographs they are no such thing, they are on very flimsy paper and very disappointing.     My conclusion is that the records are great but the packaging for them is very poor especially when compared the Back To Basics set, still worth the money it is cheap for a 3 x 180g set, I would have preferred to pay more and have a nicer quality package. Check Christina's official site, they are selling a nice box set but it's just a box with the same LP set in it.
B00275EGWY|4.0|No matter what we do, It all boils down to the human factor.   It has been said that you never really get to know someone, but we never really get to know ourselves.   Under certain conditions, even under orders, there is no telling what we might do.   with this particular peice of cinema, sample the effect!

0385523386|5.0|I should confess my bias from the start - I am a public defender in western Massachusetts, so not liking this book would be like not rooting for the home team.  Thankfully, this is an easy book to love.  Kerman is a gifted narrator, sharing details of a directionless post-grad life after college, when she joined up with an exotic older woman for international vacations that just happened to involve the arrangements of drug transactions at the margins.  I think she portrays herself as a bit more naive than she probably was, but that's kind of the perk of getting to narrate your own story.  After the waterfalls and beach parties of her youth, Kerman explains how she became a mature woman with a grown-up job and a devoted fiance, so there is a tangible emotional shock when the inevitable criminal charges finally reach her.  From there, the book becomes something really fascinating, as Kerman avoids the cliches of brutal corrections officers and illicit lesbian sex by presenting details that seem realistic (yes, there are officers who get out of line, and there are romances among prisoners, but they are not sensationalized).  The reader gets a genuine look at the wide variety of women in a federal facility, from the loud and mentally ill to the quiet and spiritually centered, and I was moved by the honest friendships that arose unexpectedly throughout Kerman's incarceration.  I have already recommended this book to co-workers in my office, peers in other parts of the criminal justice system, and friends who counsel college students who are in danger of following a similar path to Kerman's.
B000YI7MRM|2.0|- The makeup was terrible. When the movie started, Diego Alatriste (played by Viggo Mortensen) looked like a soldier who was around thirty years old. He came back to Spain to take care for a kid,  Iñigo, who was a son of his dead friend. Years later, when Inigo became a young man of 18 or 19 years old, Diego still looked exactly the same! It's ridiculous.    - The fencing scenes were so amateurish that they reduced the value of the film. Only the fighting scene at the end was worth watching. It was intense, bloody and looked real.    - There are two love stories. One was between Diego Alatriste and María de Castro. The other was between Iñigo and another lady. However, they were fragmented and briefly depicted. Consequently, they did not stir up any emotion at all.    - The movie's flow was so incoherent that it made the movie uninteresting.     - At the end, I felt unsettled and touched by the comradeship between Diego and his friends. That's the only positive think about this film.
B003QNXPUK|1.0|Maybe the solution provided in mine was inadequate, but the procedure listed in the instructions just don't work.  The protector just doesn't SLIDE at all even with coverage on both sides.  For the price of this thing, I expected something that would be bubble free and less of a serious pain in the ass.  I threw the thing out in disgust and decided that I might as well have eaten the $25.

020530902X|3.0|With so many other grammar guides out there, this one is very simple in its rather rigid guidelines. It might be good for beginner writers who are fluent in English, but I wouldn't recommend this book to students since this book is very dated. It's considered a classic for grammer, but I find this book to be overrated. I prefer to have an other grammar guide than this one. Some of the rules used in here are rather old fashioned. The writing is very stiff and forced. Personally I prefer other grammar guides over this one, but this one good for reference.
B000002AP1|4.0|The last of the Stooge trilogy is mostly a triumph of sheer \\"rock action\\". So why only 4 stars? The botched mix from both the Bowie Camp & Igg's remix that just falls short. My main problem is still track 1 \\"Search & Destroy\\" unlistenable or just painful mix by Iggy. He was not kidding when he said its a violent mix & everything is in the red! I'd grudgingly take Bowie's mix over the Ig mix & that is awful too. The problem with Bowies mix is there is NO rhythm section (where's the beef?) It's all Pop/Williamson & and sounds very tinny. At least my original vinyl can be \\"tweaked\\" on the EQ to dial in the Ashtons. Ok, back to the reissue or remix. After the IN THE RED Search is where this baby is king of the street & totally aces Bowie's mix. It appears \\"someone\\" in the control room saw the VU meters in the red & brought them down to listenable levels but still very loud & in your face. This version really dials in Ron Asheton's bass guitar vs that of Bowies \\"anemic\\" mix. Ron Asheton is the unsung hero on this LP. He was asked to take a back seat to upstart Williamson on this & play bass. Anyone else would have told Iggy where to go especially after his work on the Electra sides. Ashton straps on his fender bass & totally locks on to his brothers kick drum to create one of the most nasty & urgent rock lp's to come out of Ann Arbor/Detroit bar none. The stooges are just at full tilt, full throtle for one of the best swan songs any band could deliver & they probobly new it when they were cutting this in England. There was nowhere to go but down after this one sad to say. In my opinion, the IGGY mix is the one to go with but I have yet to hear the remastered Bowie mix. Something tells me Ron Asheton is not UP where he should be!
B003AO1SVS|1.0|This album is so over-hyped, it's almost comical. This isn't blues. This is a couple of pretentious hipsters acting like they're doing some really edgy when in fact it just sucks. Most hipsters don't know anything about music anyway, so the whole community of hipsters will eat this up thinking it's liek sooo kewl and liek real artsy becuz theys revived teh bluez. I'm sure plenty of hipsters will listen to this garbage wile drinking their PBR tall boy's. I'm warning everyone not to buy this. I made the mistake and regret my decision. Maybe you should take off the skinny jeans which are cutting off vital blood flow to the brain and see this is such a stupid sounding album. I wish hipsters would go away. Who honestly cared about any black keys albums before anyway? No one cared until Attack & Release and only because Danger Mouse helped produce it.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|Since you are so disgusted with this film, all of you who bought a copy, received one as a gift, etc. Please reply to my review. I will gladly buy your gently used DVD.    This movie (in my opinion) was the most entertaining, original film in many years. It is a work of fiction.    I could be wrong, but I'm guessing the plethora of 1-star reviews can be attributed to jew-haters, who find this (fictional) version of WWII an atrocity.    Again, I would love to buy your unwanted DVDs (please no DVDs that have been used as drink coasters, screw-drivers, and the like.
1435248244|4.0|Tally is an \\"ugly\\" who is about to turn 16, and therefore about to become \\"pretty\\". This is a world where everyone receives surgery on their 16th birthday in order to achieve perfect beauty. But events unfold that she could never have predicted, causing her to betray some of those closest to her, and forcing her to turn the mirror on herself and face the fact that ugliness goes beyond skin deep, and in so doing she discovers that beauty also lies deeper.<br /><br />This was a pretty good \\"yarn\\". The characters aren't thoroughly fleshed out, but well enough so that I have a connection to them. Truths about our society as it stands today are highlighted, even touching on our reliance on oil and our destruction of the environment. The environments of Ugly Town, New Pretty Town, The Ruins and The Smoke are well-described, allowing me to envision them in my mind's eye. The story leaves me hanging and wanting to get my hands on the next book in the series to see where this story is going.<br /><br />This was a good YA story-- good characters, good plot, good writing. Superficial yet revealing, Uglies has assured that I'll be moving on to the second story Pretties before long!
B000002L61|4.0|Some great songs on here, with We Rock, Last in Line, One Night in the City, and Mystery among others.  There are some filler songs on here, though imo.  Overall a very worthy Dio album and a must have for all his fans.
B0000035E7|4.0|Bleach is what grunge was originally: heavy and dirty, and that, along with cobain's perfectly textured, emotionally charged voice make Bleach a classic grunge album. It cemented nirvana's place in music as innovators. shortly after its release nearly every band in Seattle was following their lead. Nirvana did not invent grunge, but they certainly shaped it.
B000063DFS|5.0|This is one of those rare albums by an artist, be it Ozzy or anyone, that is great from start to finish.  There are absolutely no filler songs on here...you can listen to this album all the way through and never have to skip over any songs.  Further, this is album number 2 with Zakk on board, and it's clear that the chemistry between he and Ozzy is spot on both in the writing and performing with Zakk fully focused in his pre-BLS days, as well as some great writing collaborators such as Lemmy from Motorhead.  If you want to hear Ozzy in top form, then No More Tears is a must have.
B00004W50T|5.0|I really don't know what to say about this album, except that it's one of the greatest albums of all time, and that you shouldn't be disappointed! It's worth every cent and more of the 11 dollars they charge. Also, if you're one of those people who are interested in this album for The Weight alone, then I have this to say to you: The Weight isn't the best song on this album by any stretch of the imagination. Not even close...

0439023483|4.0|I read The Hunger Games last night. It was a good thing that my husband was out of town because once I started I had to finish. I turned the light off just after 3 am. I've been hearing so much about The Hunger Games and I've been curious to see if it could live up to the hype. While it is not \\"the best book I've ever read\\", I did enjoy it. It is thrilling and consuming, gripping,and engaging--essentially, a can't-put-it-down read.<br /><br />Combining themes from \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" by Richard Connell, \\"The Lottery\\" by Shirley Jackson and Orwell's \\"1984\\", this recent dystopian novel is like a more entertaining blast back to high school English class. I was impressed that even through the themes are dark the main characters maintain their humanity.<br /><br />Well done.

B00136JNTE|1.0|If it's not the original, not worth a dime.  Thanks to previous reviewers for pointing this out.  I tried to locate the original on Amazon, but don't see it anywhere.  Would I need to get a CD to get the original, and is it worth the trouble, expense, etc?  I'm new to Ozzy's work, so don't know how to rate his releases.

B001EN71CW|5.0|This is the show that introduced me to the greatness that is Joss Whedon. Don't let the idea of a \\"Space Western\\" turn you off - this show, with its great characters, witty dialog, and clever writing will take you for a fun and all-too short ride. The Blu-ray is not the best I own, but definitely worth having for this series. Nathan Fillion has become one of my favorite actors (see him now in ABC's Castle) and he is brilliant in the lead role as the captain of the Serenity.
630469654X|5.0|This is a great movie that can be considered a chick flic as well as a fantasy and an adventure film.  It has a little violence, but is clean and entertaining for everyone.
0525423842|3.0|I enjoyed the book, found it well-suited to children's reading, interesting, and by Grisham's usual fine hand.  BUT it just stopped, so abruptly that I thought I had a bad copy.  Surely to intend this as the first of a series, Grisham did not need to leave all those story lines hanging.  Very puzzling, and most unsatisfying.
0143034901|1.0|Comparing this book with Eco or Borges does it a disservice since it leads to disappointment; it does not even attempt to do more than amuse the reader. In that respect, it aims to be as enjoyable as a good Perez-Reverte or Alexandre Dumas. Plot driven, with flat characters, it had the potential to entertain, but sloppy writing (or poor translation?) and repetitiveness turned it into one of the most boring books I have ever read. I love the genre to which it belongs - it is just a very poor exemplar.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|An excellent series that blends western and science fiction with well-written and well-acted series. Firefly is entertaining even if you aren't a sci-fi fan.     One major warning, however: With only 14 episodes, you'll come to the end and find yourself very sad it ended. TV doesn't get much better than this. Too bad Fox TV didn't get it...    Thanks for this gift, Joss.
B003K07DUC|3.0|I admit to being a Matt Damon Fanboy. Even so, I didn't think this was his best. Of course, the script I found very limiting, IMO. What can an actor do.    The supporting acting I thought was okay. If ya are going to watch this on VideoOnDemand be prepared to find much of the Iraqi dialogue unintelligible.    Some of the action was downright unbelievable such as the interference by the contract mercenaries in US Army operations.    The script did seem to dovetail nicely with the current popular understanding on the early days of the Iraqi intervention.    I just was not that gripped by this film as compared to the Bourne series of films.    But all in all, it was good for an evening of viewing.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I can't believe the show is ending after this incredible series!  I will miss and always love the show if it never returns, but if it doe's return,  all the better!    Dylan whitty  I love GH!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I loved this collection - It brought me back to high school, and gave me something to smile about.      The only downside is a lot of the original music was removed due to licensing.  I didn't mind it.  It did not influence my vote.      Enjoy, everyone.
0316044938|5.0|I've owned this book for years but just got around to reading it. I don't believe in heaven, angels, spirits - none of it, but that didn't stop me from loving this book. Sebold creates an other worldly atmosphere that I did not resist because of the strength and beauty of her writing, which somehow avoids being overly sentimental and deals with very ugly subject matter with objective grace. Even the ending that many objected to was for me stunningly, not painfully over the top. Generally, I'm ready to move on when a book is over but I did not want The Lovely Bones to end. What to follow it with was the problem. A heartbreaking work of art.
B003JSU2NU|5.0|I am a huge Twilight fan, but will not buy an album merely because it is associated with the books/movies.  Had a listen to my friend's copy first and decided it was definitely worth it!  Am loving Metric, Florence and the Machine, UNKLE, Sia, The Dead Weather and The Black Key's contributions.  Highly recommended - something for everyone!

6305428220|5.0|I recently watched this film again for the 5th time and to my surprise, it hasn't lost any of it's wit, charm or scare factor.  I've seen hundreds of films in my life and this one ranks right up there with the best of them.  Why? \\"The Faculty\\" clicks on all levels.  It acomplishes what the filmakers set out to do and even surpasses those goals in some instances (the actors are Oscar calliber, seriously).  For some reason it's become a forgotten film.  I would think by now more people would have discovered this little gem.  This film surprised me the first time I saw it (in the theater where I don't think it did so well) and continues to surprise me to this day.  I've tried but I can't locate any flaws.  It could very well be (dare I say it) the perfect film.
B003HLM2QO|3.0|Listening to Ozzy's new SCREAM, the first thing that comes to mind is further proof that Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler were the real creative talent behind Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Ozzy's new album here is no comparison to last years release from Iommi's HEAVEN AND HELL (aka Black Sabbath featuring the recently passed vocal legend Ronnie James Dio on vocals).<br /><br />Why will I never listen to SCREAM again ?  (I already gave my copy away to some kid at the gym).<br /><br />Most of the songs are very boring and repetitive.<br /><br />The worst offender is the title track which gets annoying after Ozzy sings \\"Let Me Hear You Scream\\" 300 times over and over and over behind a mask of excess studio processing.<br /><br />There are certainly worse things out there and Ozzy is a metal legend, so I give him credit for that.<br /><br />However ..... after listening to this CD twice, there was nothing that stuck in my mind as memorable or anything I would want to ever bother hearing again.<br /><br />Pretty much just a wall of noise guitars tracked in stereo, heavy slammed to 0.00 compression, vocals processed to the max with harmonizers, chorus, pitch shifters and Roland V-coders, etc...<br /><br />But unfortunately the songs have that \\"mass produced\\" hired writer sound to them with a certain stagnation and formula.  Heavy for the sake of heavy but nothing catchy or memorable.<br /><br />And of course, the great days of high budget music videos are gone here in 2010, so PLEASE spare yourself the pain of watching the YouTube videos for this album that are on YouTube.  They are sad and painful to watch .... so much in fact they are actually funny and comical.<br /><br />Hey Ozzy has made more $$$$ than 99% of us , so I can't knock his success ......... but this is not a CD I will ever listen to again.
1602838011|5.0|This may be the best Austen reading I've come across so far. Frances Barber has a lovely voice and she never gets bogged down in the long sentences, navigating them with dexterity and lively rhythm while never allowing them to peter out. She is particularly good at the dialogue, differentiating clearly between the many voices and always selecting the appropriate voice for each character. My only criticism is that she takes time to warm up to the author's own voice. Austen's authorial persona is charged with gentle satirical point and Frances Barber sometimes fails to articulate the barbs in the early chapters but as she moves through the novel she becomes more and more responsive to the Austen idiom. In the last half she is nigh on perfect.<br /><br />The novel itself doesn't have the romantic allure of \\"Pride\\" or \\"Sense\\". It's a more sensible, \\"classical\\" work than either of those and may even seem boring by comparison. The strengths of this novel lie in its highly pointed observations, always understated and easy to miss, and Frances Barber manages to convey much of this fineness of judgement.

0805091742|5.0|The Checklist Manifesto is a fast and fascinating read that provides a tool that each of us can use in our daily lives.  The author's description of the cockpit procedures that saved US Airways Flight 1549 reminded me of the checklist my co-pilot and I ran through when the engine in our UH-1H exploded on a flight in 1975 from Grafenwoehr, Germany back to our base at Fulda, Germany.<br /><br />I was particularly caught by Dr. Gawande's description of extreme complexity and by how checklists can be used to coordinate the activities of people in different functional areas.  The author's idea of verifying checklist contents and structure with the people that actually will implement them is really important.  I learned the value of getting input from the people that actually carry out tasks as a young Army lieutenant. My firm has adopted the inverse of the \\"To Do\\" list in our software product by creating \\"Don't Do\\" lists that streamline processes and remove unnecessary tasks - and complexity.<br /><br />This is a terrific book.  If you purchase it, be sure and read it through at least three times.  More insights appear with each reading.  I'm confident that The Checklist Manifesto will help you improve your business and maybe even your personal life.
1400052173|4.0|A story that needs to be told so that we are aware of the price that the advancement of medicine has cost. The story is so interesting and brings up so many ethical conflicts between whether human cells, blood, fluids, etc. still belong to the individual once they have been excised from the body. It's so unclearly defined that I still have yet to really decide what I believe.    Regardless, what was done to Henrietta was certainly an \\"injustice\\" but we can't forget that what was done happened in the 1950s. There is no question there would be lawsuits to boot in the 21st century over such things, but these laws didn't exist back and then and certainly not for the black community. It's unfortunate and unfair and it makes you sick to think about, but we can't go back and undo all the wrongs that have been done to every person in the history of the world. We wouldn't know how to learn from our mistakes if we were able to do that.    I do think it is important to honor Henrietta Lacks and her family, above all. To be grateful for her contribution, though through non-consent, to medical science. It's important to take heart that she has saved likely millions and millions of lives because of vaccines and cures found through medical research on her cells.    If we were to go back to the 1950s and ask Henrietta on her dying bed if she would want her cells to go on to help cure endless illness and save millions of lives, I guess I would have a hard time saying that she wouldn't say yes. The problem is that she wasn't asked.    It's a sticky wicket, so it's certainly worth the read. Very informative and well-researched. You cannot doubt Rebecca Skloot's credibility. I would have preferred to read about the story in a lengthy journal article, rather than a 370+ page book.
B001GCUO4S|1.0|Failed to bring anything new to the series and it all ended disappointingly with the no one surviving.  Big surprise.<br /><br />Computer graphics were very poor and death scenes were a joke.<br /><br />By the end I got tired of seeing people getting run over by cars or getting objects hurled into them.  Death kills people in such a long, thought-out, by-chance way that it just becomes a joke.  Death can move objects freely and also stop electronic devices from working, seems a bit too much to me.

B002G1YPH0|4.0|As per all my assemblies, I initially set the CPU and Motherboard up on the workbench and the first impression on pulling the cooler out of the box was that's thing's a MONSTER! The dimensions of the cooler still seemed tight but should have been ok for the pretty standard horizontal case I was planning on setting it up in. I removed the cooler prior to final assembly and it was the last addition prior to buttoning up the case and to my surprise, the top lid would not close! It seems that the dimensions may not have included the slightly added height due to the two copper nubs that stick above the unit!<br /><br />The solution was to DRILL two holes in the lid to accomodate the nubs and I was able to fit the unit. I tried the same dimensions (nubs included) on 4 of my other systems - only ONE would accomodate this!<br /><br />Bottom line - if you have a big roomy case - you should have no problems, if it is a midsize or smaller beware (or get the drill ready)!
B002ZG9828|3.0|I only saw this because I had the Jonah Hex heroclix which let me know it was a DC Comics property & because Megan Fox was in it.    I didn't have much interest in the character to begin with & still don't so I suppose it failed on that account.  Not being aware of what was & wasn't comic accurate, I found the revenge story interesting enough.  It held my interest enough that I told the guy who sold me the ticket that I liked it (we talked a little before the movie) which I basically did so I got my monies worth.  Just like the Punisher movies, it's one I didn't like enough to buy it unless we're talking real cheap which sounds likely in time.  I like my comics a little \\"less-ordinary\\" people oriented is maily why though.  I like the sensational.    Personally, I would've rather seen more of Megan Fox.  She didn't have a huge part.  Not saying she should have but remember my two reasons for watching it?  That said, if she's why you're interested, don't bother.  If you've seen the trailers, you've pretty much seen her role in the movie.    As a side note, most of the jokes fall flat partly because most of them are in the tailer.  They searched you good, cute myself shaving, etc.  Think I found them somewhat cute the 1st time I saw the commercial but by the time I saw them in context, I could see them coming a mile away & was tired of them.

B002ZG994U|5.0|I was skeptical.  I liked the original actors & had a hard time seeing anyone trying to fill these roles.  Part way thru the movie, I kinda forgot about that.    This is essentially an origin story & beyond.  I found it neat how they were able to update the series with a new story that was essentially a prequil. It simultaneously pokes fun at & sorta stays true to the original series.  Great action, fun story, good humor.  I left the theatre happy as the movie totally exceeded my expectations.    If you are a fan of the series with sketicism, I say leave that behind I go have fun with it.  I'm sure non-fans can enjoy it also but I believe being a fan of the old material enhances the experiece.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|I'm not even going to imply that I'm some music expert, but Recovery is so far beyond anything I've heard in years that I find myself compelled to write something about it just to share my enthusiasm with people.  I'm like many of Em's fans who thought he kind of fell off his game after Encore, but Recovery isn't just redemption for his lesser works; it's one of the most complete, raw and imaginative albums I've EVER heard.  The way he plays with words, switches flows and creates crystal clear imagery with his lyrics is above and beyond any artist out there in my opinion, regardless of genre.  Even on the few tracks that don't have catchy background beats, Eminem more than saves them with his lyrics and delivery.  I know I sound like a fanboy, heck, I probably am, but I can't express enough how significant this album is to me.  I don't pay for much music anymore, but I gladly paid for this to show my support for this genius who just put out a masterpiece.  Thanks Em, I'll be putting this on repeat for a long time!

Don't be afraid - workout 1 is tough but definitely doable.  And Jillian's right.  After six days I was ready to give workout 2 a go!  Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but I put on a pair of pants that haven't fit in quite some time - and well, they do!!  Best of all, I feel like I can be fit at 50.  That's a real gift.  Best money I've spent in quite awhile.  Go for it.
1934030554|5.0|This book is really great.  It gives me a very detail information about power meter.  It lists all the power meter of the world.  Good for pro!  However, if you are a beginner, you may find it difficult to understand.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This joins an impressive list of British miniseries based on classics of literature. The acting and direction are impeccable, the production lush and authentic, the story altogether riveting. A terrific period piece that closely follows the Dickens novel. But to call it a \\"satire\\" of a class-bound society--which it is--is in some way to undercut what is very much a heart-breaking story, so movingly told and acted. Not a false step.
B0000CDJPQ|4.0|It works fine and dandy, but it so big and awkward that sometimes its hard to stick it in if there are multiple items taking up the adjacent spaces. No technical problems thus far, though.
B002ZG983M|4.0|I saw this at a theater a week or two ago, at the tail end of its theatrical run. Didn't know quite what to expect, but enjoyed it for what it was: a violent, goofy, over-the-top exercise in comic-book mayhem.  I guess with a name like \\"Kick-Ass\\" you'd have to expect violence, and this movie has it. Lots of it. But it also offers some sly social commentary and moments of dark humor. \\"Kick-Ass\\" is not for everyone, but if you don't mind swearing (lots!) and violence, then you'll probably get a kick out of \\"Kick-Ass.\\"  Overall, I give this a low 4 stars.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Daniel Craig delivers a gritty performance that redefines the bond franchise for todays audience. Where the Bond's of past got out of jams with gadgets and bravado, Craig wills his way through chases, fights, and villains all the while keeping you emotionally invested. Eva Green excels in her role as a female counterpart to James. Worth getting on BD at around $20.

0807130087|5.0|One of the best books to read.  It captures the culture, the insanity and pure innocence of a not so tortured soul.  It is not heavy reading but it grips you.  I have now read it five times.  This was a book purchased for my doctor!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a great adventure/comedy.  My whole family enjoys it.  I really like computer generated cartoons and this one is one of the better I've seen.
0307266303|5.0|This book is a great story. I am not a distance runner although I do enjoy running short distances, a few miles and sprints. The story is great and I think non-runners who have any interest in sports or Indians would enjoy the read. I like the barefoot aspect of the story. I go barefoot and made some huaraches using the instructions at [...]. I think the huaraches are great, better than shoes but not as good as barefoot unless you are on a nasty surface or going somewhere where shoes are required. I stick the huaraches in my back pocket. Very convenient. The book also has some great information about the Tamahumara Indians.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|This was a wonderful story of a young, intellectual girl, letting herself fall in love. Smitten by the one, first man Jenny meets, he is everything and more that she had been waiting for in a young man.   However, David is not so young, especially in comparison to Jenny's ripe age of 16. But, nonetheless, David is a charmer, and this is how he wins over the love of Jenny, her mother, and now, especially her father.    London, 1961, Jenny is smart, attractive, eager to start her life, she's grown tired of the old familiar routine she became all to comfortable with her whole life.  Jenny is ready to embark on a new world, one she gets swept right into, a world with endless possiblities, a world of deep romance.  Jenny is swept out of her 1960's British prep school while she is awaiting her addmissions to the prestigious OXFORD.  Jenny can't resist David's charm and is swept into his exciting world of nightclubs, ballets, art auctions, and staying out till the wee hours of the morning.  In the end is it your typical girl meets boy story?  Or is it something more, with a twist you don't see coming, and a young girl who has more to offer the world than ever before.   It is a coming of age story, as well as a lovestory with a lesson in the end.   All and All it was my  favorite movie of the year, and I would have given anything to spend a few days in Jenny's shoes at the height of her new found love affair with the charming David.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Being that I thought that last two DEVO albums, Total Devo and Smooth Noodle Maps, were faceless and bland dance music, (with the exception of the excellent single, \\"Post Post Modern Man\\"), I had my reservations about a new album. Sometimes, it can take time away to refocus what your band was all about. And now, DEVO has returned with a true DEVO album.    Musically, it's very comparable to Oh, No! It's DEVO, which was released in 1982. It has many of those wonderful buzzy and blippy sounds throughout. Over the past decade or more, there has been a gradual understanding that the crude sounds from an analog synthesizer are far more appealing than the crystalline sounds of digital synths. And while some artists, past and present, incorporated some analog sounds into their \\"new\\" albums, it wasn't enough (for me) to make it as appealing as it once was. Some artists are learning the more analog, the better the results. DEVO has come to that realization.    Though I don't like every song on Something for Everybody, it deserves 5 stars for the quality material and the recapturing of their original sound. So many artists try to blame \\"musical growth\\" for their treading water into blandness, but they often sacrifice what made them initially appealing. DEVO did go that way, but (likes SPARKS before them) have realized there's nothing wrong with developing an ID of your own and being able to stick to it, while still growing and trying new things. \\"Fresh\\" has been the single that's currently being plugged, and it is a very good song, though not the best on the album. I find the amusing video somewhat reminiscent of their classic video for \\"Are U Experienced\\". My immediate thought when hearing  \\"Sumthin'\\" is that this is their modern day \\"Whip It\\". Just listen to that drumming. Heck, there's even a whip crack at the beginning. I doubt it will set the charts alight if released as a single, but good luck to them. Contrary to some fans, I think \\"Cameo\\" is one of the main album highlights. It's very catchy and it cracks me up. It could be the theme to some modern day Xploitation film. \\"Later is Now\\" is my choice for the best catchy chorus. This is classic DEVO at its finest.    Four additional songs are currently available only as downloads, two of which are definitely essential and even better than some of the album tracks. The classic single from a few years ago, \\"Watch Us Work It\\", and the super catchy \\"Knock Boots\\". Not everything on the new album is a winner. Though it's been one of the more promoted songs, \\"What We Do\\" grates on me and I have to skip it. Also, some of the songs that are good are somewhat marred by fairly weak choruses. This includes \\"Please Baby Please\\" and \\"Don't Shoot (I'm a Man)\\". These are not bad songs, just not as strong as they could have been. And as mentioned in another review, I have to echo the disappointment in the volume of the CD being maximum compressed. Will this bad habit trend ever end?    A real satisfying thing is that both Gerry and Mark's voices are in stellar shape. They sound as strong as they did over 30 years ago, yet they are now senior citizens. I do hope this album is the start of a future string of excellent albums. I could see DEVO cranking out quality music in their eighties. And I just saw that Something for Everybody debuted on the Billboard Hot 200 album charts at number 30. I think that's pretty impressive for a band that's been gone for 20 years, and have returned with an authentic, yet modern New Wave album. Long live the Moog and Casio..., and DEVO!
1594202559|4.0|First of all, the book is very well researched and well written. It's an easy read and gives a good general overview of the history of hedge funds. The author takes us via A.W. Jones's first hedge(d) fund (later: hedge fund) creation from 1949 through the 60s and 70s into the 80s and 90s and through the recent financial \\"crisis\\" (I would say it was a correction after a major boom/hausse) in 2008/09.    The reader is introduced to various legends of the industry like George Soros and Stan Druckenmiller as well as to Julian Robertson (Tiger), Paul Tudor Jones, the Commodities Corporation, Citadel, Jim Simons and others, as well as also to some hedge-fund implosions of Long Term Capital Management, Amaranth, etc. and to the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Also some short sellers like Jim Chanos and David Einhorn are mentioned. Of course, there are many top guys missing, and the words SAC (Cohen) and ESL (Lampert) or Blackstone are only in the text without any details, ... and there's no mention whatsoever of Cerberus, BlackRock, Icahn, Apollo, etc.    One thing I didn't like in the book, was that quite some time was spent on George Soros, probably due to the author's background, ... but at least Soros wasn't portrayed as the hero/savior he holds himself so often out to be, but instead the author also shows the reality of the very dark side of Soros and it makes you dislike the guy even more.    But the book is an essential book and an absolute \\"MUST\\" read for every trader and money manager, and for everyone working at a hedge fund. Not only is the book interesting for a general reference for an overview of the evolution of hedge funds, but also the various trading techniques, and also about the fact that each superstar hedge-fund manager/trader in his time is just human and has made major mistakes along the way costing them at least many hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars. Some traders will get additional confirmation that they're on theright track with their strategies, even though they'll have to fight the same \\"demons\\" like everyone else in the biz, ... and others will get a good thought here and there and most likely will be able to improve on their strategies, to fine tune them and to become even more successful in their approach.    The author has a good categorical and chronological approach as well a rare somewhat easy recap feature so that the reader understands the whole picture and understands the rich substance of the context rather easily. There's also extensive and helpful appendix and index. Although I've read thousands of books and have written a number of books myself, I haven't found many good books over the past few years, but I can say that I'm glad that I've come across this book and I think it will be very beneficial to every reader interested in the subject. You could say that the book is even inspiring to those who are interested in this field. I would have given it almost five stars, but because major players were left out I couldn't go for the five, and if there was the possibility of 4 1/2 stars this book would have well deserved it.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|Invictus is a movie that presents two interwoven themes: The beginnings of the reign of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa, and the story of the rugby World Cup of 1995.  The pace is rapid and the tone tense, as Mandela has inherited a country burning with racial tension and on the edge of civil war.<br /><br />Nelson Mandela, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, begins his attack on his nation's problems his first day.  His message is clear.  South Africa is one nation, one people, who must work together for the good of the country.  As Mandela arrived for his first day, the government employees of the previous administration were packing to leave.  Mandela asked them to stay and help the country heal.  This set the tone of his plan.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Springboks, the South African national Rugby team was adrift, not knowing their fate.  Mandela sought out the team captain Francois Pienaar, (superbly  played by Matt Damon) to ask his help building a first rate world cup team.  A surprised Pienaar agrees.<br /><br />Mandela's focus upon the national rugby team projects a message of reconciliation for the nation of South Africa.  Mandela asks his people to follow that model.  Mandela sets the example by learning the names and backgrounds of every member of the rugby team.  He visits some practices, tells the team that the entire nation supports them, then approaches each man, calls him by name and thanks him for his help.<br /><br />The title of the film \\"Invictus\\" is taken from a poem by William Ernest Henley.  The lines of the poem inspired Nelson Mandela when he was in prison for 27 years.  Several of the verses relate to the film.<br /><br />Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />And yet the menace of the years<br />Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.<br /><br />It matters not how strait the gate,<br />How charged with punishments the scroll.<br />I am the master of my fate:<br />I am the captain of my soul.<br /><br />\\"Invictus\\" is an excellent movie that is well directed and well acted.  It presents world events that most Americans never witness.  I highly recommend this film.e that is well directed and well acted.  It presents world events that most Americans never witness.  I highly recommend this film.
0375842209|1.0|Because of the solid reviews on this book, I ordered it (although I, like many others, was hesitant to purchase another book on the often exhausted topic of the holocaust). I'm 75 pages in and I'm already wishing I hadn't made the purchase. The author's style of writing strikes me as being contrived, disingenuous and unoriginal. I don't think the narrator - death - is all that clever. I just finished \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" by Carson McCullers and switching from her work to this is almost painful. It's simply not good writing (and I don't think if I were to continue reading it would improve). Perhaps if I were sixteen and reading this I might give the author more credit. But as an adult whose read a substantial amount of great works by great writers, I can't continue on with this one.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|After years and years of writing McCartney off, this album has gotten me back into his music.  I've missed some good stuff, but Electric Arguments is one of the best things I've heard from anyone in years.  The music is heavier than what you might be used to hearing from McCartney.  It's experimental, fun, modern-sounding, and will appeal to those who like a range of McCartney's singing style(s) and want to hear his voice paired with some exciting music tracks.  BUY IT! Don't think twice!
0792837614|5.0|I remember when I was young, I went to the Palm Theatre on Palms Boulevard and saw West Side Story showing with Bye Bye Birdie and I thought to myself 'this is what life is all about.\\"  What an enjoying day that was.  I didn't get a whipping from my dad that day, I saw two great movies, and felt for once in my life like an actual teenager.  As soon as my dad picked me up from the movies, reality set in, but for the few hours it took to watch these two movies I was in another world.  I kept humming \\"I feel Pretty\\" until my dad knocked it out of me and than I switched to \\"Kids\\" by Dick Van Dyke.  Even if you are at home, watch these two movies back to back and enjoy.
B000KQGOA4|5.0|As a fan of Gustav Holst's best known musical work, The Planets, I have heard many recordings, but none were better, in my opinion, than the 1961 version by Herbert Von Karajan. I found this vinyl treasure back in the 1970s when I was in the throes of discovering the thrilling world of classical music. I played that poor record until I wore it out. Thankfully, I recently learned that this favorite version is available on CD through Decca's \\"The Originals\\" collection. If you want to hear what many consider to be the finest realization of Holst's most famous composition (including the composer's own daughter Imogen), this is the one to get.
B0033AGPF8|5.0|I'm a hippie, at least I was 40 years ago and \\"Axix, Bold as Love\\" is hot hot hot!  Listening to it with my eyes closed put a smile on face that i could not remove for days.  This was a good time in my life.  I had left home early because my father raped me, people who I didn't even know down at Venice beach, let me live with them and fed me and still go to school. This album was played every night and even though I did not smoke pot at the time i would close my eyes and get just as high as everyone else in the room.  Well, that high is still there, this is an album that needs no drugs, it Jimi's at his coolest, best!
0739328190|5.0|My mother really enjoyed reading this book.  She was born in the South during the depression.  President Obama is her hero.  It was a treat to read about his life.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|This album \\"Electric Ladyland\\" I listen to with headphones on while everyone is sleeping at night.  I am one of those people who like to pretend that I am playing the instruments while I listen to music, so I sit in a chair, put the headphones on, crank the music, and hit it baby!  I'm so exhausted when the album is over, that I go to sleep immediately.  Who needs drugs to sleep, just listen to the right music.  Rock on Hendrix!
0307592839|5.0|Jennifer Egan's \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad is the best work of fiction I've read in a very long while.\\" It's a real tour de force--interlinking stories, mostly about a group of people in the music industry.  The stories touch down at different times in their lives, purposely out of chronological order so we often see what happened to them before we see why they ended up the way they did. Very memorable characters, especially Sasha, a kleptomaniac and Bennie, a music producer.  Two stories are devoted to an actress named Kitty Jackson, who we first see as an aging actress who's career is on the skids and then as a 19 year old when her career is a fresh and beautiful new blossom. This is the first Egan novel I've read, but she's already a well established writer and this one will push her up there with the best American novelists now writing.  I can't recommend it too highly.
0618918248|2.0|I read this book expecting to find a reasoned scholarly work.  Instead, what I found was a mean spirited rant against religion from a bully with a Phd in biology.  I am not a religious person but even I was offended by the high-handed and contemptuous attitude the writer adopted in relation to religious people.  His arguments regarding the illogic of all organized religions are impossible to argue with.  However, he is strictly preaching to the faithful because his scornful tone will not convince anyone who does not already share his opinion.  His arguments regarding the non-existence of God are, candidly, rather thin.  In essence, it is that since the scientific method cannot prove there is a God, there isn't one.  Also, showing his own personal biases, the author (who is an extremely prominent evolutionary biologist) tries to import Darwin's theory into every avenue of life, including religion and sociology.  While I believe that Darwin's theory definitely shows how life biologically evolves, I'm not prepared to use it as a universal theory in other areas of study like social attitudes toward God.  There are certainly some worthwhile observations in this book but the author's tone and style undermine his ability to convey these facts.  I look forward to a more objective work by an atheist.
0385342039|5.0|Sophie Kinsella continues to deliver fabulously entertaining books with hilarious characters and story lines that leave you wanting more! This book is no exception. I have read all of her books thus far, and this one is one of my favorites. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it, given the storyline. Come on, a ghost? Really? Yes, Really! It is hysterical, heartfelt, and hard to put down. I highly recommend this!!
B001NLKT60|4.0|Based on the first book (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo)- which was awesome - and the reviews, I really thought this book was going to be just as good.  What a disappointment.  It's nowhere near as compelling as the first one.  Don't get me wrong - Larsson is a gifted writer. But, this book is lacking the pace and fire of the first one, making it a little bit of a dreary read.
030726999X|5.0|The third book in this series did not disappoint.  The story picked up where the second book left off and it was hard to put down.  A book I was sorry to see end.
B000PC0S5K|1.0|The ebook price is more than the paperback edition. Why? I loved buying Kindle books because it seemed like a way to support authors but cut down on my costs.  Now, it's become easier to buy used books, which benefits authors and publishers not at all.

0060557818|1.0|I grabbed a copy of Neverwhere at an airport bookstore after only a few minutes of shopping and I wish that I had taken more time in my book selection.  This was among the worst books I have read in many years. I started off disliking the main character after 20 pages and it didn't get any better as the novel progressed.  There is no explanation for the background or functioning of \\"London Below.\\"  There is a mishmash of bizarre characters, but none of them are well developed. The entire story ends on a whimper.  Save your self and avoid this novel.
B003954I9C|5.0|I really love AJ's album, Have It All. My favorite song right now, not just from this album but overall, is the title track, Have It All. Teenage Wildlife is just a lot of fun - watch the video if you ever come across it. Sincerely Yours is amazing; I've never heard AJ sing with such raw emotion, but it makes sense, considering the subject matter of the song. The rest of the album is great, too. One of the best things about it is how diverse it is musically. There is no way to truly classify this album under any one genre. I highly recommend it.
B00275EHJG|5.0|It was 11 years ago when I saw Toy Story 2 and in the bloopers  the prospector said \\"So you two are absolutely identical ha ha, you know I'm sure I can get you a part in Toy Story 3\\".  When I heard this I thought it was just a joke, but 11 years later boy was I wrong!! I saw this movie last night and I absolutely loved every single minute of it!!! In fact, I heard talk on a 4th Toy story, but that is up in the air for now until further notice. Anyway back to the movie. I found several parts very humorous such as the beginning which is a western style action sequence and when all the toddlers come running in the classroom and \\"play\\" with the toys. Aside from the funny scenes there is a delightful cast of characters many of them returning from the first two Toy Story films with the addition of some new characters such as Ken and Barbie (who is voiced by the talented Jodi Benson who is best known today as the singing and speaking voice of Ariel in The Little Mermaid films and TV shows). Speaking of Barbie, she was okay, but I felt that she was not as animated as she was in the previous film. In other words, she was more of a happy go lucky free spirited teenage like character whereas in this film, she's more of a grown up adult. Overall, this is a great addition to the Toy Story films and definitely worth watching.
B00000G3PL|5.0|Lethal Weapon is a classic and one of my personal favority cop/action movies that is somewhat reality based.  There is no disappointment in this box set - you get exactly what you'd expect - all four movies.
B001HN69B8|5.0|Beautiful movie. Not as inaccessible as some of Gillium's movies. The visuals are stunning and best of all it has the late Heath Ledger<br />and the great Tom Waits.

B000001EL3|5.0|This disc was nothing less from the classic cover to it's awesome melodies one of metals finest moments. That's good melodic metal though, thrash rarely has melody.<br />This one was kiss at their peak and they could be both menacing and fun enough to appeal to everyone. As they decade progressed they went more pop metal then pop in 1980 but this one until alive 2 was the band doing everything right.  Song's like 'flaming youth' the hit ballad 'beth' , 'shout it loud' 'do you love me' , 'sweet pain' and others really were solid written and should be regarded as among  the best of any metal fans collection. This one was widely accepted even by non metal fans as that term was rarely used then anyways as being a kick butt disc and right so.  It still is every bit as fun as the day it came out in 1976. Kiss was the worlds number one band for years to come and they are still near the top even today.  but this was their masterpiece disc , the one that will be regarded as their finest moment for many fans and non fans alike.
0439023483|4.0|At some point in the future, North America is ruled by the iron fist of the government.  The continent has been divided into districts, each one working for some government good and enclosed in electric fences.  To leave the enclosure means death.  To disobey the government means death.  In the somewhat-distant past, one district tried to rebel and was bombed out of existence.  Although district 13 was destroyed, the government needs a way to remind the people of the futility of fighting against them, to remind them that they are helpless.  Thus the Hunger Games are born.    Every year the twelve districts each choose by lottery one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen.  The chosen boys and girls are sent to the capital city, where they are cleaned up, well fed, pampered, carefully groomed, and evaluated by a group of judges.    Then they are sent into a giant arena to fight to the death.  This event is gambled on and televised for all to watch.    Sixteen-year-old Katniss lives in district 12, an exceptionally poor coal-mining community.  Her father is dead, so she illegally hunts in the forest outside of the fences in order to feed herself, her mother, and her sister.  When, against all odds, her twelve-year-old sister is chosen for the Hunger Games, Katniss leaps forward to take her place.    She knows that odds are against her.  Still, Katniss can hunt and handle some weapons.  She knows how to quietly stalk prey and how to stay hidden.  And she seems to have the support and friendship of Peeta, the boy chosen from her district.  Katniss can't understand why he is always so nice to her, when she knows the two of them need to be prepared to kill each other in the arena.      I really liked the plot of this story.  It's horrifying and fascinating, and Katniss is a very strong and conflicted character.  I liked reading about her strategy and the way her mind worked, and her empathy for others in the story.    I did think it was frustrating thatshe just couldn't possibly grasp what Peeta's motivation was in being nice to her, especially when he kept telling her over and over again.  How much clearer could he have been about his feelings?    I'm looking forward to reading the second book in this trilogy.
B002AT8KB0|4.0|This is an action classic.  I recommend the trilogy for diehard action junkies.  A must see.
0061765236|4.0|Why does anyone commit suicide?  More to the point, why would a beloved, beautiful, intelligent, talented high school senior with everything to live for choose to end her life?<br /><br />This is an unanswerable question. Ms. Picoult presents us with a myriad of possibilities; early sexual abuse, an unplanned pregnancy, confusion about the nature of a relationship, high parental expectations or perhaps a combination.  It's bewildering.  It's more bewildering when the plot plays out and it seems that neither Emily nor Chris considered the legal implications of Emily's ultimately very selfish act.  For such bright, mature young adults, such lack of forethought is incredible and is the weakest part of the book.<br /><br />Far more powerful is Ms. Picoult's fearless exploration of the repercussions of Emily's death on the families and friendships involved.  It's a cautionary tale of the power of forgiveness and the damage caused by withheld resentments.  That is the meat of this book and her likeable, believable characters provide much fuel for thought and discussion.

B0039UTDA6|1.0|This is certainly not the one you want. Go with the David Attonborough narrated one. Oprah Winfrey narrating is a great marketing idea to the mass of Americans who are otherwise a herd of sheep following her every word (literally)but this is not true form to the masterpiece. The real deal is in the Original and buy it on Blu-ray if you can.
B00006G9QN|5.0|An interesting story, for me, because the author & my father held the same rank. I wonder if they ever met. I have noted that all the technological advances supposedly back engineered from the alien craft do not have a discoverer attributed to them like Edison, Bell or Crick. These inventions: night vision, Kevlar, fiber optics, brain wave/PC interface and perhaps a primitive form of antigravity propulsion (if Area 51 witnesses are to be believed) have just come upon the scene from various corporate/military laboratories. Col. Corsos' grasp of wide ranging technologies seemed genuine to me. All in all, the book is a good read that may be truer than us earthlings want to admit.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Tremors is one of those \\"cult\\" movies...either you like it or hate it.  We like it.  There is quite a bit of language in 3 of the 4 movies!  But great for a late night movie!
B002VHI8HC|2.0|I have not watched the TV series. The idea and story in this novel is interesting but I did not enjoy the writing. The author underestimates the ability of readers to get to know Dexters' complex psyche through his conduct, and in doing so ruins the opportunity to create a really compelling protagonist. We know that Dexter is a serial killer with excellent self knowledge, because he tells us that in so many words throughout the book. The first person narrative weakens the story. We constantly read that \\"I am a killer without conscience\\" and \\"I am a monster\\", and then \\"I try to behave as if I have human feelings\\" and \\"I behave charmingly\\", all of which I found tedious. Why so squeamish? Just let Dexter be himself instead of having him tell us about himself. It is like listening to a bore at a party telling you their dreams. Boring. If you want to read books by an author who know how to create believable psychopathic characters read Barbara Vine and you will see how badly this book is written. The stars are for the story which though badly executed, could be thrilling.

0545157617|5.0|My mom is a librarian in an elementary school. She brought this book home while we were visiting and my kids love it! We purchased it when we left her house because they did not want to leave the Stick Man book behind. It is cute and easy to read. Two thumbs up! (My kids are between the ages of 2 and 6.)

B000002LFU|2.0|If you're offended by my statement, put it in your pipe and smoke it. I bought this album when it first came out, and it wasn't a bad album, except that for the three or four hits from it, the rest of the record was absolutely boring. What made it irritably boring is Michael Stipe's wavering voice in songs that should have been best sung by perhaps another member of the band. In addition, the overhype in the media about this band kind of ended it for me after this album. There were a couple of good songs from followup efforts, but essentially this band went the way of U2: Overhyped, oversold, in your face, all the time.I don;t begrudge them their success as they've certainly earned it, but when the media started focusing on the homosexuality of the lead singer (of which I couldn't care less anyway), the band responded by breaking up some time later. They made their millions. The overnight success and over-promotion killed them for me. A shame.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Great film noir.  Great acting.  Glenn Ford at his best. Rita Hayworth at her best.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Tom Hanks provides an ominous VoiceOver at the beginning of each episode of The Pacific, calmly informing us of the horrors the episode we were about to see would bring. For me, it was a somewhat scary experience, because I knew that what I was hearing was nothing more than a summary. And then the episode spiraled into the powerful theme song featuring a powerful orchestral score and charcoal drawings of soldiers in battle coming to life, scared amidst the hell of war. The DVD release of the Pacific bears my highest recommendation simply because the show is unrelenting in it's depiction of a very unrelenting Pacific theatre of WWII. James Badge Dale turns in one of the finest performances I have ever seen on television alongside Eugene \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge and the unforgettable, milestone psychopathic performance of Remi Malik as \\"Snaffu.\\" While Steven Speilberg does not step behind the camera for a single episode the miniseries echoes the spirit of Saving Private Ryan. It is a masterpiece and carries my highest recommendation.

B001ECQ4AS|4.0|Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) Winchester are brothers who are on a journey to find their missing father, who was hunting the evil that killed their mother. Along the way, the brothers find themselves hunting the very things that their father faced including popular urban legends, vampires, ghosts, and other paranormal monsters.<br /><br />A decidedly dark and grisly series, Supernatural appeals to a wide range of horror and thriller fans. Scary and violent, this series isn't for the faint of heart. Padalecki and Ackles are fantastic actors that are put in a shocking and bizarre situation each week, sometimes getting to play beyond their own characters.  Each episode is a nightmare/freak-of-the-week, full of heart-pounding suspense and chills. And the stunning visual effects are impressive for a television series.  Now each of the 22 episodes is available in HD, making the picture ultra-clear and ultra-scary.<br /><br />Special Features Include:<br />- The Devil's Road Map: Interactive Map Guide to Season One's Urban Legends and Unusual Facts<br />- Paley Festival Panel Discussion Featuring the Cast and Creators<br />- Unaired/Extended Scenes<br />- Commentary on the Pilot by Series Creator Eric Kripke, Director David Nutter and Producer Peter Johnson<br />- Commentary on Phantom Traveler by Co-Stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles<br />- Two additional featurettes: Day in the Life of Jared and Jensen and Supernatural: Tales from the Edge of Darkness<br />- Gag Reel
B0009UC7H0|5.0|this is SUCH a great movie! i just kept renting it and borrowing it form people and finally decided that it is worth just buying my own copy! it has just enough action and adventure to keep your attention, with an underlying love story, and lots of humor throughout, even though the main plot is a serious one. i always recommend the widescreen version of a movie to get the full artistic effect that the film makers intended; often there are little things off to the side, or face expressions or body motions or scenery that gets cut out in the full frame editions. and i always recommend getting a movie with special features: knowing what the intent was by the writer, director, producer, and some of the background info, sheds light on the creativity of the film and gives more appreciation for the film and those who made it and acted in it. excellent movie and features!
B0011UF792|5.0|The film is called Dogma not Gospel.<br /><br />I think this is a fun, great and quirky peek into a different vision of God and religion. It kind of reminds me of the latest season of Supernatural, but with sillier bits, like the Angels having no nads.<br /><br />However, the point made some other reviewers with regards to the painful twist of their beloved doctrine does make me sigh. Quite simply, why watch the film? It is titled Dogma AND a film by Kevin Smith, which would alert most people sensitive to anyone viewing their beliefs differently - to stay away.<br /><br />No wonder they believe a virgin gave birth!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I liked how the narration came from both of the main characters perspectives, depending on the chapter... This was a different technique that worked well for this story.  I'm excited to read on and find out what the next adventure for the Kane kids will be!
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|The translation of this book left much to be desired in my estimation.  It was dificult to relate to the characters.
B0039TD7PY|4.0|I attended their reunion concert a week before I bought this. This CD/DVD is a faithful testimonial to the wonderful synergy and timelessness of two of the best songwriters in pop music. If you have a chance to see them during their tour, you'll be impressed at the energy that Carole brings to the stage, complementing JT's wonderful presence. I was amazed at how these two musical giants shared the stage, combining their considerable talents for a memorable evening. If you miss the tour, this isn't a bad way to commemorate their careers.
030726999X|5.0|I love this book and the entire series. You have to read them in order.  The only part I didn't like was the names in the stories are so close, you have to make sure you read the entire name.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Someone has a sick sense of humour!    Why would they have 'Oprah' narrate a series called 'Life'...when all she tries to do is suck the LIFE out of all of us.....?!?!?!?!?! I'm buying the British version..!
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Hands down, this movie is the best psychological thriller I think I've ever seen.  This movie will keep your interest from start to finish.  Keeps you guessing what is going on, what is real and what isn't.  Leo does an excellent job as leading role.  This is the type of movie that will leave you thinking about it even after the movie has ended. Don't let anyone tell you the story before you watch it, will just spoil it for you. Great movie!
B002VPE1YS|5.0|Good looking case, I really like the quilt design and smooth material. The mini carabiner clip is a great idea for a bag of this size as you can add attachments or secure it to a larger bag. A little large for a cell phone but perfect say for a camera and accessories. Not something I would carry on my person but something I would throw in a bag for extra protection and convenience when taking it out.
1400052173|5.0|In the 1950's a relatively young African American woman entered Johns Hopkins Hospital suffering from cervial cancer.  A doctor took a swipe of her cancerous cells and cultured them.  Unlike other cells, these did not die shortly after being cultured; instead, they multiplied at an amazing rate.  The woman whose cells were used was Henrietta Lacks.  She died soon after that, leaving five young children, as her cancer had spread rapidly.  Neither she nor her family initally knew of how and why her cells were sampled or what they were used for.  In this work, journalist Rebecca Skloot fills in all the details, from the Lacks family history, to the medical staff who were involved at first and those who later used the \\"HeLa\\" cells to further culture techniques or to conduct research and create vaccines, to the shysters and other characters who played bit or important roles in the story.  Skloot covers not only the larger story but also her own involvement with the main source of her facts, Deborah Lacks, one of Henrietta's daughters.  Skloot does this without losing objectivity, allowing for the perspectives from all sides on the controversies surrounding not only HeLa cells, but the also the whole larger issue of what rights people have over their own cells. The story is most moving at points when the Lacks family, particularly Deborah, encounter revelations about how her mother lived and who she was, giving Henrietta the humanity and dignity which her family had sought to restore after all those years of ignorance and misinformation.  A truly fascinating read that links together the raw facts of the human condition with the sublime motivations to find answers to medical problems.
B002ZG997C|4.0|Book Of Eli directed by The Huges Brothers who also directed Mence II Society which I haven't seen in years I remember it being good though. It stars Denzel Washington as Eli Gary Oldman as Carnegie & Mila Kunis as Solara. Basically to get straight down to the plot there's this guy named Eli he has the last bible in the world in pot apocalyptic 2043. You have this guy Carnegie who want's the bible for manipulation or power I don't know maybe its best I don't know & leave it up to my imagination. Then a girl Solara joins Eli later on basically that's the plot. I felt there were flaws Denzel Washington Gary Oldman deserved better a better actor to work than Ray \\"Rome if she want to Stevenson 1 funny thing during an action scene he fired a CGI rocket he did the same thing in Punisher Warzone. Carnegie was a airly weak villain but Gary Oldman did a good with what he was given. Denzel Washington gave a good performance I 've never seen Denzel Washington give a bad 1. I thought it couldn've used more action. There was a cool cameo by Malcom McDowell I wish he he could've been in the movie more. I do kind of like the score. It's definitely worth renting I'll probably buy it too. So pretty good movie I thought.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|Daemon by Daniel Suarez is a modern day Boogie man story. What if one man could turn the technologies we rely on everyday against us? What if that one man did so not to gain power or wealth but to change the fabric of society; to usher in a new era in which governments no longer maintain the social order? Daemon is a technical thriller that follows a team of law enforcement agents, hackers and military as they try to unravel the plans of dead, millionaire programmer Matthew Sobol. Prior to his death from cancer Sobol creates a distributed AI, a daemon, that lurks across the internet waiting for news of its' creators death. When that day comes the program enacts Sobol's plans to change society. Individuals and business alike are compromised or recruited by the Daemon and soon an army is born.    Daemon is successful as a thriller though as such it is a bit tame. As a technological thriller however Daemon shines. Based in realistic technologies, grounded in actual computer science and cognizant of the political and social ramifications of technology policy today the book paints an intriguing picture of one possible future. The greatest strength and weakness of the novel lie in its' complex plotline. While the book is never confusing it is intentionally unclear. The lines between good and evil are blurred. The book begins focused on the police work of Detective Peter Sebeck. The reader will assume that Sebeck will be the hero of the tale but by part two of the novel it is clear that will not be the case. What is not quite as clear is who will take his place. This is a novel in which several protagonists work, sometimes opposed, sometimes together. As the novel closes the reader is left with serious questions as to who is good and what the ideal resolution might be.    Daemon is excellent on all counts. It is a well written, exciting adventure. Its' characters are complex and compelling. Its' plot is intricate and thought provoking. That said this novel might leave youfeeling uncomfortable and dissatisfied because of its' ambiguity. If you do not enjoy technology you will want to give this book a pass. Otherwise it is well worth the read. Grade: A-
0470477237|5.0|I'm impressed by socialnomics, is a amazing book!  To all interested in socials, this book is mandatory.  As soon as you start to read the 1st chapter, you'll notice that many times we think wrong about the social networks, and sees how we need to think to promote our brand in this environment.  Erik Qualman, translates this universe called social networks using an objetive and easy language, and the exemples is the better ones.  I recomend it.
B003HLM2QO|3.0|What happened to the Ozzy Osbourne I grew up with in the 80's?  This music doesn't sound *fun* anymore.  The songwriting doesn't seem interesting anymore either.  It's not that I'm getting tired of Ozzy's music either- he's definitely doing SOMETHING wrong.  Something happened about 10 years ago and now his music just doesn't work for me anymore.  I believe the lyrics are one problem, but not necessarily a serious one.  Well, some of the guitar playing is nice.      The opening song for instance, despite containing a guitar riff that's definitely a huge ripoff of the \\"Children of the Grave\\" riff from nearly 40 years ago on Black Sabbath's Master of Reality album, the verse melody is just horrendous.  Ozzy's barely even singing anything there.  He's mostly just blurting out unmemorable lyrics over and *over* again until the chorus comes in.      \\"Diggin' Me Down\\" is generic to its very core.  If this song sounds familiar, it's because you've heard more or less the same thing several times over the years.  Ugh, Ozzy's more talented than this (or at least, he USED to be more talented than what's featured on Scream).    Some of the tempo changes recall the classic period when Ozzy was more daring, influential and just overall better, but that's about the only compliment I can give concerning the majority of this album.  It's even more insulting how some of the background beats are borderline techno.  I kid you not.      What you experience from Scream is most certainly NOT the essence of heavy metal, that's for sure.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I found about this show when it was in the middle of season two and when i watched my first episode i was hooked like a junkie (no pun intended).The acting,writing,dialogue,cinematography all the elements of this show makes it one of the most captivating shows ever. Vince Gilligan (the creator)has come up with pure genius when he came up with the ideas and storylines for this show,if you are not familiar with it then start with season one and then of course season two and then catch the unforgettable season three and then look to March 2011 when season four comes...you won't be dissapointed i can guarantee it.
0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown brings back Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon in another thriller combining ancient legends and mystique with modern day mysteries. In this book Langdon gets a call from an old friend to give a speech to wealthy Smithsonian donors. When he gets to the site, he finds that there is no speech and no gathering. Instead his old friend, Peter Solomon, has been kidnapped by a seeming madman and unless Langdon can solve an ancient Masonic code, his friend will be killed. The book then takes off in a dizzying chase involving Langdon, the CIA, and a spooky, tattooed villain who seemingly will stop at nothing to achieve his quest and who has almost super human powers to aid him.     I love the constant tension and fast paced action of Dan Brown's books. I also like the behind the scenes of the real world settings. I can even take the religious woo woo around which Brown's books revolve-- it's kind of like reading something by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, except Brown's books focus on Christian mysticism. I really enjoyed about the first two thirds of this book and found it hard to put down. But the last third dissolved into pure silliness. When I discovered the great secret that was supposedly such a huge issue of national security that the CIA was willing to do anything to stop its dissemination, I thought, \\"That's it?\\" I was simply unable to suspend my incredulity beyond that point, and I thought the last part of the book so unbelievably silly that I really cannot recommend that anyone bother reading it.     Go ahead and read the first two thirds of the book if you want a really good, creepy, fast paced thriller. Just stop when you get to the CIA raiding the villain's house. You're better off making up your own ending than trying to accept the silly ending Dan Brown wrote.

I've tried contacting customer service from Target, but I get referred to Amazon, and no help has come.
B000QXDED6|2.0|300, the 2007 story of the three hundred Spartans who held off a massive Persian offensive in Ancient Greece, proved a disappointing film. In spite of my Classics degree, I won't complain about the divergences from recorded fact. The film is clearly meant to be a fantasy on historical themes instead of a faithful account of the event. Rather, what irked me was the hammy dialogue. There were the tropes of recent Hollywood battle scenes: warriors on the good guys' side defending themselves with little exertion as they trade silly quips about how they've got each other's backs. A queen gives an address to a council that is all melodrama -- are we back in George Lucas' \\"Star Wars\\" prequels?<br /><br />Being a fan of SIN CITY, I thought this would be enjoyable on the basis of its special effects, but alas it wasn't. For one, the cinematography is claustrophobic. All outdoor scenes but one were filmed with a green screen, and the digital backdrops add no depth. Even when supposedly standing on the Greek coast under a big sky, everyone seems like they are just standing around in a fairly small room. Also, the fight scenes seem more primitive than THE MATRIX RELOADED of a few years prior.<br /><br />The little I can recommend 300 for is the variety of demonic monsters and exotic constumed assassins that fill the Persian army. As I said, this is a fantasy on historical themes, and the additions are often interesting. Still, I had a hard time sitting through the whole film.
030726999X|3.0|The first two books in this series were excitng and well worth reading.  They would each rate five stars from me.  This installment of the Lizbeth Salander travails was difficult to get into:  Several hundred pages of politics and police intrigue.  I began keeping a list of good guys and bad guys, but gave up when it reached 40+ characters.  New folks were still being introduced and lengthily described on page 531.  I had eagerly awaited the publication of this novel, but if it had been the first of the series, I would never have purchased another.  I give it three stars for a readable/forgetable end.
0679892478|5.0|This is one of several books I bought for my niece on her 1st birthday. A year later she still loves these books.
0143116177|2.0|I expected this book to give a good insight (as opposed to a comprehensive history due to its length) on how the monetary and financial systems developed throughout history. It is instead a series of historical anecdotes thematically combined on each chapter. Some of them are really informative (the ascent of the Rothschilds), others are downright superficial and inaccurate.<br /><br />The political and economic doctrines of the author are obvious in the reading of the book, as pointed out by other reviews. There are some instances that, however, exhibit lazy research and/or bias. The description of the economic policies during Pinochet's dictatorship and Friedman's Chicago Boys is an example. Any historian knows by now that the \\"miracle\\" was not such, and the long term economic prosperity in Chile really started by the less rigid doctrines of the Minister of Finance Hern&aacute;n B&uuml;chi in the mid/late 1980' and by the democratic governments post-dictatorship. The rigid doctrinal policies of the Chicago Boys only generated one of the worst Chilean economic crisis in 1982.<br /><br />This book is and easy read and has some interesting facts and stories, but lacks the depth and insight of a good historical book.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|After reading the Twilight books, I had to have the music to go with them.  I have ordered all the soundtracks for the movies and will order the rest of them when available.  Ordering from Amazon is quick and easy, and so far, every link I have ordered from through Amazon has been good to deal with.
B003BKF696|5.0|The National's music inspires the head before it touches any heart.  Matt Berringer's lyrics get you thinking if you are willing to think.  His songs are not quite as obtuse as some critics argue. Try wading through Thom Yorke or Michael Stipe's figurative menageries for a proper representation of \\"obtuse.\\" Instead, I suggest that Berringer is as playful and funny as he is insightful and poignant.  His lyrics have the rare ability to capture personal and cultural conditions like Joseph Heller did in Something Happened or Catch-22.  To me, High Violet has a caustic kinship with Heller's Something Happened and Lewis's Babbitt and Mainstreet.  His album is a strident 2010 commentary on love, fatherhood, and relationships.  There is no doubt that there is a drug-induced, \\"high,\\" element to his aural stories.  He exists as a ghost or in a etheral zombie-like trance throughout much of the album.  The album's main trope, however, is the colors Berringer consistently interposes. Feelings are the colors of emotions.  We don't necessarily perceive emotions.  We witness them as feelings, as the colors of our emotions. Violet is a combination of blue and red.  Most symbolic references to the darker colors associate them with sorrow, but violet, according to one of the more cogent websites, \\"is also the highest and most subtle specialization of light.\\"  It will be obvious, even after the most cursory of listenings, that fear and sorrow color much of this album. It is important to remember, though, that while violet can a \\"dark\\" color in a metaphoric sense, the color is a possible spiritual beginning as well. I suppose we will have to wait until the next album to find out what happens next.  Finally, I agree with most critics that this album has a tighter thematic construction than Boxer and Alligator, but this does not mean it does not have some great songs.  For example, \\"Conversation 16\\" is an incredibly well-written and melodic song.

0525423842|3.0|As an avid J. Grisham reader, I didn't realize when I purchased this book, that this was his first attempt at youth or teen writing, until I realized that it was published by the Youth Division of Penguin Books.  Be that as it may, I enjoyed the book, and it is an excellent introduction in promoting the various aspects of the legal profession to young readers.  Also apparent to me the JG is trying to \\"market\\" the idea of a legal career to our youth and teens.  The story is a good one with various legal genre explored (and explained), and the conclusion (SPOILER ALERT) begs for a sequel.
B00005NB8K|4.0|This film somewhat disappointed me. I walked away from this film thinking that Jim Morrison was an alcoholic jerk who cared only about himself. Thankfully, soon after watching this movie I read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive' and I have come to see a better picture of the true Jim Morrison.<br /><br />It seems as if Hollywood is only interested in the abusive side of Morrison and not the more down-to-earth side of Morrison. Oliver Stone made Jim's character so one dimensional... and this is a serious flaw in a movie that is based, for the mostpart, on one man.<br /><br />That being said, Val Kilmer plays a GREAT Jim Morrison. The movie has many fantastic parts: the making of 'Light My Fire', the cinematography in Jim's desert peyote scene, the Miami concert.<br /><br />It is a great film to watch, but definitely read 'No One Here Gets Out Alive' if you want to understand the more human side of Jim Morrison.<br /><br />4/5

1594202559|5.0|When I read through page#97, my first thought is this book will rank as high as the Remini of a stock operator and two market wizards book. Now I am in page#179 and I still think so.  This is one of the best trading books I read in the recent five years.      I was a history and war buff, the one thing I notice is that a thick detail history or biography books often are not as good as books that are writen from a high level but with a lot of details to illutrate the pointd made. This is one of those books. For example, the details regarding 1992 pound sterling is the best one I read so far. It fully make the points regarding Soro's character. Better than any Soros's biography or the books writen by himself.    The traders the author chose cannot be better.    From a trader's prespective, this book will go down in history as top five trading books all time.    I believe this is the 2nd Amazon review I wrote ever. and it deserve the time I spent.

B003HFFVDQ|5.0|My relationship with The Chemical Brothers has been one comparable only with my favorite soccer team: happy when they win, sore when they lose, and utterly frustrated when the moves are so obviously wrong that I swore to give it up altogether several times. Their previous two records have been a collection of big names and non cohesive songs that did not flow naturally and were rather chopped, almost forced to sound good to entice buyers instead of stimulating followers. Further shatters the curse and by taking a step back the Bros. move forward, ahead of the stagnant phase they seemed unable to surpass.    The first thing that one notices is the minimal use of voice and vocal samples. The few times Tom Rowlands or singer Stephanie Dosen participate is to enhance rather than lead, which helps to structuring sequence and avoid disrupting the mood of the record.     Escape velocity, the first taste we heard of Further, is over ten minutes long, pays homage to The Who with synthesizers that give cue to an ecstatic celebration impossible to miss and not once resorts to supporting vocals to soar. That they managed to pull off such a welcome flashback to their glory days is a remarkable fact.    Horse power is probably the track that most captures the spirit of their music: built on two simple words it gallops its way to an explosive chorus that would make any club goer cream with pleasure.  Fist single Swoon capitalizes on the memento and pushes the record to a mellower conclusion. By the time the last notes of Wonders of the deep  vanish one is left with the impression that we have just experienced one of their live shows, such is the force of their sound and the immersive flow they deliver.    The digital release offers two more tracks, Don't think and Porquoui, and the CD/DVD pack shows their first proper partnership with long time visual collaborators Adam Smith and Marcus Lyall, who created a short film for each one of the eight tracks.    Further is a well-roundedelectronica record. It belongs in the dance floor and not in the playlist of some pop station. The Chemical Brothers maturity does not sound dated; it is renewed, energetic. By shedding off the entrapment of an aged formula they have succeeded in creating their best album of this decade.
B000002P6R|3.0|First things first.  The Who didn't have to pack it in after Keith Moon's death, and the fact that they carried on was vindicated by the spectacular quality of their 1979 live shows, arguably the best performances the band gave since the 'Who's Next' tour in '71.  Listen to a bootleg of any of the '79 shows (especially Chicago or the Madison Square Garden performances), and you'll find a band in prime form.  However, the tragic incident which happened in Cincinnati on that tour sent Pete Townshend into a downward spiral of depression and falsely needed guilt, alcoholism and eventual drug abuse.  His feelings on his life at that time were brilliantly depicted in the 1980 'Empty Glass' album, the best Who-related work, together or solo, since 'Quadrophenia'.    The Who had a chance to redeem themselves with quality new material when they began recording 'Face Dances'.  However, they brought in Eagles producer Bill Szymczyk, who gave the songs on this album a poppy, Eagles-like sheen to them which simply doesn't suit either the band or the material very well.  Only the two Entwistle compositions, \\"The Quiet One\\" and \\"You\\", have any sort of a rock feel to them, and that is disappointing indeed.    That doesn't mean there aren't any other good songs on the album.  There are - \\"You Better You Bet\\", \\"Don't Let Go the Coat\\" and \\"Daily Records\\" are all fine.  So you've got five decent numbers on this album.  But even on these, as with the inferior songs, the material is dragged down by weak production, Daltrey's surprisingly ineffective vocals (for perhaps the first time in Who history, he doesn't throw himself into Townshend's lyrics very well), and an overall feel of a band punching a clock instead of being excited at being born anew.  I guess that excitement was used up in their concerts of 1979-1980.    So 'Face Dances' becomes almost the definition of a mediocre recording.  Certainly not awful, but not very good either.  They should have probably held off on being in the studio until Pete went through his substance abuse rehab.  And they definitely should NOT have carried on once the late, great Jimi Hendrix-of-the-bass-guitar John Entwistle passed on.    This album really is for completists only.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I stumbled upon this series completely by mistake. What a shame it wasn't given a fair chance. This series is quality all of the way. Post apolyptic, great cast, music, scrips, direction, all superb! If this series had been given a fair chance, it would still be around. I am glad I own the whole thing as well as the movie \\"Serenity\\". A must see for all sci fi fans as well as folks that just want good viewing.

B00005RHGK|4.0|Writer/director Victor Salva's did intend to launch a monster franchise, but that's how things worked out, as his scary thriller Jeepers Creepers (2001), was successful enough to spawn the high action sequel Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003), and the third entry in the series Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral, is reportedly in production at this time.<br /><br />The strange being known as \\"The Creeper\\" (Jonathan Breck), is tremendously powerful, and has the ability to fly.  He surfaces every twenty three years, and for a period of twenty three days, driven his sense of smell, he consumes humans for their body parts.  Siblings Trish (Gina Philips) and Darry Jenner (Justin Long) are travelling in Florida, when they cross the path of the Creeper's vehicle.  Later, passing an abandoned church, they again spot the Creepermobile, and observe a huge figure, grabbing body shaped bundles from the back, and tossing them down a corrugated pipe in the ground.  The Creepermobile suddenly appears behind them, and runs them off the road.  Going back to the church to investigate, Darry makes a horrific discovery in an underground cavern.<br /><br />Daylight turns to darkness, while the pair awaits for police assistance.  Darry gets a phone call from a mysterious woman who warns him that something bad will happen, when he hears the song Jeepers Creepers.  The action ramps up when the Creeper gets Darry's scent, and will stop at nothing to satisfy his needs.<br /><br />With lots of intimate dialog, Salva does a wonderful job of making the relationship between Trish and Darry, seem very real and natural.  It is the central thread that holds the film together, and both Justin Long (Live Free, Die Hard) and Gina Philips (Ally McBeal) turn in strong performances.  Long goes overboard at times, but that is kind of what he does.  Philips was 31 at the time, but easily passes for much younger.<br /><br />The suspense is sustained, by keeping the Creeper obscured for most of the film.  Psychic Jezelle Gay Hartman (Patricia Belcher) provides key information about the creature, and a deadly prediction.  The ending is a bit unexpected, but remains true to Salva's vision.  Jeepers Creepers has its faults, but is still a well-crafted, and very effective monster movie.<br /><br />The double sided DVD release, is a comprehensive package, including both widescreen and full screen versions of the film, and lots of cool bonus materials.  Victor Salva, a longtime horror aficionado, provides a fun and informative commentary track, and there are also an excellent series of featurettes covering the making of the film.  Unfortunately, nothing is heard from executive producer Francis Ford Coppola.  If you like creepy monsters, check out this series, as Jeepers Creepers 2, picks up where the first film left off, delivering big time action.  Gina Philips will reprise her role as Trish, in the upcoming third entry in the series, Jeepers Creepers 3: Cathedral.Patricia Belcher) provides key information about the creature, and a deadly prediction.

0780020685|5.0|Just want to chime in with all the other 5 star reviews that go into much more detail.I rarely ever say that a DVD is a must by but trust me -- this is a MUST BY. It's 3 hours 27 minutes of Heaven on film.<br /><br />I cannot express to you how great this movie is! This version is formatted perfectly, remastered and with wonderful optional commentary.<br />Jim
0788729144|3.0|Yes the tapes were used ... old ... even distorted in places (I had to have some one read me the last twelve pages because the cassette was so worn it would not play).  None the less ... it was wonderful to be able to hear John Stienbeck's classic read aloud.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|He brung the pain and the darker side of eminem we have not seen in a while. HAIR JET BLACK WITH THE SONGS FULL OF THAT STING OF PAIN AND HEART BREAK.
B00005JOA0|3.0|This was just as I expected, with the usual twists and turns. Great emphasis on the building of the characters, and the plot.   Quite entertaining.
0240810961|5.0|This book is worth your money, no matter what sort of art you are creating. You will be inspired, expand your knowledge, and want to consistently enjoy life the way Stanchfield did. Get this and the second volume. They are worth your hard earned money.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|Enjoying Boondock Saints 2 is all about going into the movie with the right mindset.  If you go into your viewing of Boondock Saints 2 expecting a movie you'll be seeing at the Oscars, you may come out disappointed.  If you go into your viewing just looking to be entertained for two hours, you'll come out happy.    BDS2's biggest bane is that it features some really poor acting out of a few characters.  I love Julie Benz in Dexter, but her \\"southern accent\\" in this movie is just horrible, and her portrayal as a hardened female FBI agent is just corny.  Fortunately, both the accent and the \\"she-woman hear me roar\\" stuff kind of disappears as the movie goes on.    Like the first film, the brothers steal the show here.  Rocco is replaced by another similar character who provides some good comedic relief, but the brothers themselves are HILARIOUS, and at the same time total badasses and the most convincing actors of the bunch.    Like the first film, a semi-serious plot is kept light hearted via some over the top shootouts and a great mix of humor.  There is a ton of fan service in this movie if you liked the first one.  The finish is pretty good, though nowhere near the level of pure epicness of the courthouse scene from the first movie.    Simply put, it's not as good as the first one, but it's still a very fun two hours if you don't take it too seriously.
B001MW0J2O|4.0|I bought this album because the song \\"My Girls\\" absolutely kills me.  The rest of the record is good, although only a couple other tracks approach the awesomeness of the single.  The band clearly takes a lot of time and care with its work, and some of the songs are truly inspired.  It warrants repeated listening, and it's also a chill album for vibey background sound.    Some of the synth sounds and patterns on this record are absolutely ridiculous (in the good way).  I want to hear more from these guys.
1935814060|5.0|\\"This novel by Hermann Hesse is great. I borrowed from a friend and was sucked in by its philosophical discussion. The story follow Siddhartha, an Indian in search of enlightenment. He tries a few routes, lives life as a wealthy merchant, loses hope, and... well, you can find out. It is short, not many big events, but the dialogue more than makes up for it. Anyone who enjoys novels carried by philosophical dialogue/monlogue will love this.\\"

030745455X|5.0|I remember very much wanting to read this book, the second in a trilogy, right after I finished the first one, but one thing led to another (I've got young kids!) and three months slipped by.  If you're at all wondering, you should definitely read the first book in the series (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) first; you'll want to read it anyway if you read this one, and it really does set the stage.  What I liked about this book was pretty much what I liked about the first book: its quirkiness and unexpected twists.  The author includes lots of little details that aren't at all necessary to the plot, but are just kind of interesting.  For instance, the head doctor at an old folks' home in Sweden is from Sri Lanka.  These little details just give the book a lot of texture and depth that an ordinary thriller would lack.  To be honest, the book dragged for me a bit in the middle, when it got into the details of a police investigation, but the beginning and the end are gripping.  If you're like me, one of the best feelings is feeling like you can't put a book down, and sure enough I stayed up til 2 AM last night before I finally conked out (made it through a few critical chapters).  Finished the book today, and enjoyed it, although probably a shade less than the first one.  I was kind of annoyed that the back cover of the paperback gives away important plot elements that didn't happen until about a third of the way through the book - kind of the way that movie previews nowadays give away way too much.  For me, a lot of the pleasure in this series is sitting back and letting the book take me on a wild ride with no idea where I'm headed.  For that reason, if you're reading reviews before buying the book, you really ought to stop right now because you're denying yourself the pleasure of unexpected discoveries, unless you happen to move in Swedish lesbian satanic cult circles.
0385341008|5.0|I could not put this book down once I began reading it.  Thanks to my daughter-in-law, I had the extreme pleasure of reading an informative, interesting, captivating version of history.  I did not want it to end!

B000GCFO0I|1.0|Okay, if you liked the games, then you'll probably like the movie, but for everyone else - don't waste your time.<br /><br />Falling ash, weird creatures, and an incoherent storyline don't make for good entertainment. It's sad, because there was great potential here for a movie that would appeal to everyone (gamers and horror fans alike).<br /><br />Too many questions aren't answered (what happened to Alessa? Did she die in the hospital? Did her tormentors in the parallel die in real life? No explanation of the religious beliefs, etc, and why won't the survivors of the town talk?)  The ending is completely unsatisfying.<br /><br />Buy the games instead of the movie. With hope, that's more entertaining.
B000001IQH|5.0|This is punk rock gold. This is easily in my top three favorite punk albums, and certainly the greatest by Rancid. This album has a phenomenal onslaught of animated lyrics, agressive drumming, and intense bass lines. There simply isn't a song on this album that I don't like, or that doesn't take me back to when I first heard it. I can still to this day listen to it in it's entireity and be overcome with energy and happiness.
0894803123|5.0|This book it great, lots of reciepes and was interesting to read all the facts about Ben & Jerry.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I will first start off and say, that I did not mind Relapse - it had a couple decent/good songs, but the album as whole felt kind of \\"meh\\" - beats all ran together, and nothing really outside of We Made You and Beautiful stood out from the rest of the tracks..    Recovery is easily on a whole other plane than Relapse, and it may go down as one of Em's best albums when it's all said and done.. It definitely has a production style that we aren't used to Eminem having - it's not selling out, or going pop - it's called evolution... Rap has clearly evolved over the years from a niche genre to a dominant force in the music industry - and you don't stay on stop by sounding the same, production values and styles change - the game has changed, grew and evolved since The Marshall Mathers LP or The Eminem Show... Relapse felt like it was trying too hard to be those albums at times - and that was part of the problem.. it felt like it was trying too hard envoke the ghosts of those albums, while trying to stay fresh, and very rarely is that a formula for success.. Recovery is Eminem fully evolved into what the game is today.. and this album proves that he is still the man to beat in terms of Rap royalty - No, not Jay-Z.. Eminem is the real king of rap - and long live the king - he's back.    favorite tracks from the album...  Talkin' To Myself, Going Through Changes, Not Afraid, Seduction, No Love, Space Bound, 25 To Life, Almost Famous.... the rest are good, but i believe these songs to be the absolute best.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Struggled a little with some awkward grammar (translation into English} but the story was fascinating. Followed the book with a viewing of the movie (foreign film with English subtitles) which helped to flesh out geographical descriptions in the novel. Highly recommend this book, and also its two sequels &#34;The Girl Who Played With Fire &#34; and The Girl Who Kicked  The Hornet's Nest&#34;
B003ELOQD4|5.0|What are you people watching?  The video quality on this disc is certainly of blu-ray quality.  I would have liked the editors to give us more lingering shots on the individual performers, but detail was WAY beyond DVD.  Are you guys using the composite cable that came with your player or something?    Audio (specifically the DTS-MA 5.1 track) is of superb quality.  The details in Edge's guitar work is great to hear!  Audience ambience is nice, but does not compete with the performances.    As for the 1080i video, it is important to use the best deinterlacing component in your setup. At first I was letting my BDP-320 Pioneer player do the job, but I was getting some judder, so I switched the player to Source Direct (a feature ALL blu-ray players should have!) and my VIZIO sv470xvt1a LCD TV surprisingly did an excellent job.  Motion artifacts were gone, video was smooth as silk.

The only disappointment was that it seemed to end all to soon. I can't wait to get season 2 as soon as it's available!  Doc774
B003RNXIBK|5.0|...back and better than ever actually.<br /><br />This is lyrically the deepest album Eminem has ever brought out. He's back to rapping the way he did on The Eminem Show with such intensity in his lyrics that you can't help but sit mesmerized as he takes you down the road to 'Recovery', a journey that took over five years and was fraught with an addiction and a death that ultimately changed his life, and changed it for the better.<br /><br />First off, if you're a fan of the old Eminem, and I mean just the funny, off the wall Eminem who trashed celebrities, his mom, fellow rappers and his ex-wife and made songs that were more humorous and there to make you chuckle a little bit as he made fun of everybody with his \\"don't give a **** attitude\\" chances are you might not like this new album. Now if you're a fan of that AND all his other stuff, his tracks that had deep meaning like 'Stan' 'Rock Bottom' and 'Sing for the Moment' just to name a few, then prepare to be wowed, because this is the most mature Marshall we've ever heard (although W.T.P. shows that he still knows how to have fun).<br /><br />This time around, he's focused and determined to prove he's a new man, thankful for the fans that stuck with him, and apologetic for a couple mediocre albums. I'm not going to break down every track but will say that with a sober mind you would not believe what comes out of his head, if I had to come up with one word to sum up this album, it would probably have to be brilliant.<br /><br />Album of the year for sure - pick it up, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
006135323X|4.0|This book is a fun read. Ariely is insightful and intelligent. If you listen to his segments on NPR's Marketplace you will have hear a lot of what he covers in the book. As an academic and business writer, I found his bibliography helpful in furthering my research. The comparison between social and market transactions is a particularly useful concept for marketers as is his assertion that \\"expectations can alter subjective and even objective experiences.
0307271862|2.0|I am a huge Kurt Wallender fan, and enjoy Mankell's writing style, full of doggedness and detail.  The Man from Beijing is a hash: difficult to follow, occasionally downright boring and obtuse.  I wondered if it was a polemic of its own on China's incursion into Africa.  The connection to Sweden, site of the opening murders, is difficult to follow.  And all the characters seem very one-dimensional, particularly the \\"villain\\".  Skip this one.
1400064287|5.0|OK, I'm late to the Made to Stick party.  I didn't find out about it until I noticed it was the book most frequently bought along with the textbook I wrote (Marketing Public Relations, Prentice Hall).  I like this book for its simple, yet concrete formula for clarifying and communicating a message.  In fact, this will be required reading for my PR and Writing for Management (aka Business Communications) classes.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Two of the biggest movie names from the 1980s returned to the big screen in 2008.  The first being Sylvester Stallone for \\"RAMBO\\" followed by Harrison Ford in a new adventure portraying Indiana Jones.  I personally enjoyed this movie for several reasons and it is my second favorite Indy film, with \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" being my most favorite.    In \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" the time frame is the late 1950s.  It was cool to see Indy have a different type adversary besides Nazis, and a villainous (Cate Blanchett) as the main antagonist.  Having Karen Allen back as Marion was a plus... only she can play the right female partner for Indy!  Like the other 3 Indiana Jones movies, he had some type of nuisance to deal with (snakes, bugs, rats), this time \\"big damn ants!\\"    With the talents and imaginations of George Lucas (creator), Steven Spielberg (director), and  John Williams (composer) they have come up with a fun sequel.  Harrison Ford hasn't lost his touch... he IS Indiana Jones!
B00003XAVA|4.0|We've heard CSN, CSN&Y, and now we have just C/N.  David and Graham's vocals and harmonies are amazing.  Their selection of tunes are so varied that you can listen to it while in a kick-back mood, or driving down the highway.  From \\"Critical Mass\\" to \\"Take the Money and Run,\\" from \\"Carry Me\\" to \\"Love Work Out,\\" the myriad of songs they sing on this introspective record keep you in touch with what these guys were feeling and experiencing when they wrote them: death of a family member, a plea for love to finally come to fruition, greed, etc.  The clincher, however, is the title song, \\"Wind on the Water,\\" a depiction of the merciless killing of whales just for the sake of their by-products (read = make-up products industry).  The harmony and orchestration of this song could make even the most jaded person shed a tear.  And speaking of orchestration, this particular record had the good fortune of the mightiest of the mighty when it came to its backing band.  Nicknamed The Session (other monikers were bestowed, but we'll skip them for now), Danny Kortchmar, Craig Doerge, Leland Sklar, Russ Kunkle, Tim Drummond, were, and still are, plainly and simply, the best in the business.  Still playing gigs today (they recently performed with James Taylor and Carole King on a PBS special touting Taylor and King's Troubadour Tour), and they haven't lost (pardon the pun) a beat.  If I had to come back to life as any musician, playing any instrument (sorry all you guitar fanatics), I would become Craig Doerge.  This keyboardist is a genius.  If any of you are interested in hearing how great these musicians are, pick up a copy of Jackson Browne's \\"The Pretender\\" CD.  Listen carefully to the piano performances on \\"The Fuse\\" and The Pretender.\\"  Not only is this CD one of Jackson's finest productions as a phenomenal artist in his own right, but the combination of his heart-felt lyrics, singing, and The Session as his back-up band, make this record, in my opinion, his best (and I have them all).  Back to C/N.  Buy the CD.  I'm sorry if you don't enjoy it, but I think it's very much worth the purchase.

1452892156|3.0|The story of Frankenstein is a true classic and deserves maximum praise.  Unfortunately, the writing style is so overwrought, meandering, long-winded, and antiquated, the incredible story is buried underneath mediocre writing.<br /><br />Story receives five stars, actual writing rates one star, which averages to just three stars.<br /><br />I find the idea behind Frankenstein a very compelling tale - the creation of a flawed creature who turns on his creator (allusions to Lucifer, formerly an \\"angel of light\\" who betrays God). The moral of the story appears to be that the only reason Frankenstein's monster acted like a monster in the first place was that his creator abandoned him, showing no love, mercy, or compassion for his own creation.  Because Frankenstein's monster was not accepted by humans, he decided to reject them completely, killing and harming innocents.<br /><br />If you can get past the meandering prose, I do recommend the story, but it is unfortunately a very badly written novel.
B003QCNFN8|1.0|Ozzy really needs to do one of two things. Either get back with Black Sabbath, where he has enough talent around him to cover his short comings, or give it up. Ozzy, or maybe Sharon, has always been smart enough to surround himself with good talent. But this album he seems to have decided to be the driving force, and its more like driving a Yugo, than a Mercedes. Honestly, there is not one song on this cd that makes it worth buying. It sucks. Why would any sane man fire Zakk Wylde, who is considered one of the all time greats, and replace him with a nobody. When this album fails, and it will, who will Ozzy blame then? The internet? Zakk? Sharon? The new guy? All he needs to do is look in the mirror. Be a man Ozzy, and have the balls to reunite with Sabbath. You'll find they can make you look good, they're that good!!!
B002ZRPQ5K|3.0|I bought this album when it came out, and I have listened to it in my car several times.  My initial judgement was that this album was not so good.  Now I think that most agree that Keane albums have gotten less satisfactory with fans as time went by.  I personally like this album much better that their previous album Perfect Symmetry.  This album(ep) is short and it has addicting hooks to it.  It has a Japanese guest singer while Keane is doing a bit of that 8bit rock.  It has some hip hop it.  It has some 80's New Wave.  It is a bit all over the place, but I would not consider it a bad album.  Now here is the thing.  After listening to this album numerous time I came to the conclusion that this new Keane we have been listening to since  Perfect Symmetry is the real them.  Night Train continues in the  direction of the 80's pop that might be a nuisance to many, but the the truth is that they do this very good.  Night Train made me recall about a fact about Keane that some people don't know.  Before their debut album Hopes and Fears came out all their demos where more electronic in nature and less piano driven than what is shown in their first album.  In the inception of the group the lead singer played acoustic guitar and you can hear their influences of bands such as Pet Shop Boys and other 80's synth band.  Night Train is nothing new.  Matter a fact it's been in their hearts all along.  We all have been accustomed of liking the formulated piano driven Keane rather than their retro pop side.  Maybe we got the true Keane and we the fans do not want to accept it.  That being said I do believe that they have to calm the retro pop a bit in the future.  The reason is because the first two albums is a style that in uniquely theirs.  The retro pop is something that will be compared to by many other bands that do it better than Keane.  I also want to add that their seems to be a fourth unofficial Keane member on this album and also when they play on stage.  I think that their creative force was more potent within the three of them.  Kinda like a Genesis thing.  It might be a small point, but I feel it's worth noting.            Unfortunately, I noticed that you can get the Night Train album cheaper now.  So give it chance if you are a true Keane fan.  If you are iffy about the band, than stay safely with the two first albums.

B00122IYJY|5.0|Some debut albums take your breath away, leave you scratching your head and wondering what the \\"F\\" was THAT and re-define rock and roll in the process...Jimi Hendrix (Are You Experienced?), Led Zeppelin (Led Zeppelin), Van Halen (Van Halen), Guns N Roses (Appetite for Destruction), Stevie Ray Vaughnn (Texas Flood) are to name but a few.  All of these albums (and I left out quite a few) have the same essential qualities: techically gifted guitarists; really good, solid supporting band members and really good material.  We all have differing opinions about which songs are the best but IMO, these are some of the standard bearers for rock and roll.  Period.
B001GCUO4S|4.0|This version is much fun to watch than the last movie. The last one talks too much. This new movie is all fast action. I like the beginning, the haircut, and the guy trying to kill himself scenes.    The dvd is a double-sided disc with one side the 3D version and the other side the regular version. There is some extra but not much.    Great flick fun to watch. 4 stars.
0143038419|5.0|My husband kept telling me it was taking me a long time to read this book. All until I got the the LOVE part anyway. I think the reason it took me so long to read the first two sections (Eat  & Pray) is that I was really digesting the information. This book is spectacular. I cannot wait to see the movie!!!
B003K025V4|2.0|This is a very weak album.  Most of the songs try to be dance pop songs, but the songs are not nearly the level of other similar dance pop songs out right now from the likes of Lady Gaga or Kesha.  The really low point came in the first track, Liberty Walk, where Cyrus actually raps.  It sums up this album.  Cyrus ventures into musical areas where she is not strong enough to make it work.  The production is horrible.  Sometimes Cyrus sounds more like T-Pain than herself.  The autotune was out of control as they tried to make Cyrus' songs more dance friendly or correct weaknesses in her voice.  I am sure this album will sell well in the first week because of her popularity.  However, if not for her famous name, this album would never sell.  If you are a fan, then you will buy it because you have to.  Everyone else should avoid it.
B0029LX2LC|4.0|Here is a real review from a lifetime Roots fan. I have had The Roots blessing my speakers for almost 20 years now so don't listen to these chump reviews from high school kids claiming they know hip hop and The Roots progression. Ok so this album isn't the greatest from the legendary roots crew I can admit that but it still holds its own if you truly know the maturation and diversity the roots have been delivering for so long. One review went as far as to say this band is turning into a rock and roll thing? Look the sheer classic factor that resinates with The Roots is that they've never had and never will have a clear cut genre of what music they play. They sprinkle different genres on every track, hence their longevity,fan base,diversity,and originality. As for the lyricism it is on par with recent social awareness Black Thought and Co. have been delivering. Yeah the direction of the lyrics have veered in the last few albums but whats wrong with that if it's pushing a positive message? I mean just listen to the lyrics of \\"Radio Daze\\" and \\"The Day.\\" As usual they bring in some unknown talent (not unknown to me) for people to discover, which in itself says a lot to what the bands message really is. Blu from \\"Blu & Exile\\" (fyi check out \\"below the heavens\\" thats a hidden gem TRUST ME) makes a couple stellar appearances, as well as Phonte from another great soulful group: Little Brother. The beats are consistant and maybe a little monotonous at times but some how some way I always seem to latch on. If your reading this and your a true fan of The Roots not a recent Jimmy Fallon \\"rating\\", pick this album up. You wont regret it.

B000YJ54DU|3.0|I almost let the 169 single-star reviews cause me to skip this one.  #11 was great!  But enough folks pointed to Child's political insertions as the likely causes of the negative reviews to allow me to splurge on the $7.99.  That, and I just don't want to miss reading one, nor read any out of sequence.  (I still think he'll end up in bed with Neagley).<br /><br />So this is pre-reading; I'll edit it after turning the last page...<br /><br />2010-06-29 - I've just written 4 paragraphs, hit preview and got the \\"Sorry, our review system is unavailable.\\"  I'm not going to re-write it all.<br /><br />Unlike what the 1-star reviewers said, there was no quantity of political expousment.  Of what there was, my opinions differ, but having not been to Iraq - I don't have the facts - a simple \\"page-down\\" let me skip the prose.<br /><br />I leave the 3 stars simply because Mr. Child depicted Reacher as a bit too superhuman in this one.<br /><br />on to #13
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol is not as good as The Da Vinci Code. It's not even as good as Angels and Demons. But that said, it's entertaining, and it's better than most of the conspiracy theory knock-offs that have come out in the interim.     Lots of people criticize Brown's flat characters and formulaic writing style, but I've got no problem with any of that. I like a good story with a rollercoaster plot, and he delivers. The Lost Symbol is no exception: set in Washington D.C., it takes Robert Langdon through a maze of secret societies and fringe science and devious enemies, with plenty of \\"is that a good guy or a bad guy?\\" moments and other twists along the way. All of that is good. What I found disappointing were the big, this-is-what-we've-been-waiting-for reveals. The character reveal I saw coming from quite a ways out, and the ancient mysteries reveal was just plain anti-climatic. You're left thinking - \\"That's it?\\" Even so, the book is a great vacation read, and it will make that plane ride fly by (no pun intended)...just brace yourself for the end.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|At first, I must admit this book was a bit slow at first, but it did really catch my attention once the storyline was rolling. It's an alternate reality type book, filled tons of laughs, soft momemts and an unpredictable storyline. I was never one to go for these type of books, but this one in particlar owes me a lot (and i mean a lot) of sleep. But above all, this book does something other titles fail to do. Create questions about human nature. Humans will thrive and create society knowin there may not be a way to freedom. Congrats James Dashner, and I can't wait for th scorch trials! :)
1934356476|5.0|This book is well written and quite easy to read. The author takes a novel approach at presenting one of ruby's more difficult topics/features. The topics are introduced as conversations that take place between two developers over the course of a week as they solve real world problems.

B0036EH3XE|4.0|this season was divided into 2 stories, the island and the people on it, and another story called the alternate universe by most, which had the same actors in similar roles but they never crashed on the island.  This 2nd storyline led to much thought, with everyone watching trying to figure out how it fit into the big picture.      The Island story was excellent, slow in a few spots but revealing more than ever before about the mysteries of the island.  And it leads into an exciting conclusion which i won't spoil here.    The alternate story however turned out to be a total waste of investment into it, as it proved to be an unreal story of island souls wasting time until jack joined them.  If this alternate story had taken place JUST in the finale 2 1/2 hour finale, it might have been a superb conclusion to the series.  BUT because the previous episodes nearly all split the time with the alternate universe and that universe turned out to be a fantasy with no basis in the rest of the series, and it didn't even make sense with the final episode, about 1/2 the season was wasted when it could have been all about the island with many more secrets revealed and a bigger storyline could have been used.  Instead we got stories with Jin in a freezer, his wife getting shot in the stomach, Jack having a son who didn't exist, Locke becoming a teacher with Ben, and none of it meant anything in the end.  A case can be made for the (alternate) end having meaning but everything 'alternate' prior to the finale ultimately meant nothing and became irrelevant when the finale was shown.      An intriguing story became worthless and a lot of time was wasted watching it.  They should have condensed the 'alternate's' into just the finale and left the island story by itself.    If you watch it it can still be worth watching.  Just forward past the alternate stories as you go along, hold off watching the 'ab aeterno' episode AFTER the episode featuring Jacob and his brother and their adoptedmother for better continuity, followed by the remaining episodes, and then watch all the alternate stories before watching the finale.  It should flow a lot better that way!
B000GFLAI0|5.0|It's so good to see Bob Dylan continue to create virtual masterpieces after a career spanning almost 50 years, when most former contemporaries have disappeared into obscurity. From his early distinctive Woody Guthrie influenced folk-style, through the years of protest songs as an iconic figure of the 1960s, the truly great albums in the 1970s like \\"Planet Waves\\", \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Desire\\", his long collaboration with The Band; through the \\"gospel years\\" and a less creative fallow period to his latter-day renaissance when as a mature musician he once more has produced great and memorable music not because he needs to or has anything more to prove but because he loves it, he has great talent, and he can.<br /><br />Traditional American folk music runs through Dylan's soul like a seam of diamond through ancient granite. If there has ever been a master of the genre who thoroughly understands the core of traditional folk-country in all its forms and permutations, and can stretch the dynamic to occupy new territory, it's Dylan.<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" is a satisfying mix spiced with boogie, R&B and lyrical ballads. Dylan's choice of instrumentation (like acoustic double-bass for example, rather than the more obvious electric bass) gives a pre-rock age feel to a collection of faster, positively danceable numbers and slower, more poignant melodies with haunting, memorable lyrics shot through with wry humor. Dylan's uniquely distinctive vocal style has matured into a rich, gravely baritone perfectly suited to his material. No other musician in the early 21st century personifies traditional American folk styles yet makes the music so contemporary, so relevant to the modern age, and for this  reason the album's title is perfect and (probably deliberately) ironic.<br /><br />Dylan is like a phoenix, ever rising from the ashes into new life. That a 65-year old can find new generations of listeners and still produce fresh, distinctive and quality music like this is an almost unique achievement in the modern era. The recent Grammies and chart-topping sales of Dylan's last three albums are well deserved. In the sea of imitative conformity and contrived mediocrity which largely characterizes the contemporary music scene he continues, after 50 years, to teach younger generations of musicians how it's done.<br /><br />It's great driving music, too.<br /><br />Long may he thrive and survive.

0307387178|5.0|I give Into The Wild by Jon Krakauer 5 stars. He was fascinated with Chris and put his heart and soul into his story.  Krakauer is a very good writer and makes the book very hard to put down. From the beginning he tells you the end of the story with the end of Chris's life venturing into the Alaskan wilderness, making you want to know what happened to Chris. Krakauer told episodes about Chris's life leaving out some specifics, for example when Krakauer wrote about Chris's graduation from Emery without telling the reader why Chris was so rebellious. A similar experience that Krakauer had with Chris occured when he wrote about the time when he climbed the Devils Thumb and how he felt escaping from society and living in the moment. This is the connection between the two men had with nature; Krakauer says in the book \\"I believe we were similary affected by the skewed relationships we had with our fathers. And I suspect we had a similar intensity, similar headlessness, a similar agitation of the soul.\\" Despite his admiration for Chris, he still told us how he recklessly behaved against society and his parents.   Chris is a really interesting character, everything that he does is always very extreme. I admire him for chasing his dream and making it happen, taking risks and living on the edge. I don't admire the way that he treats a lot of people in his life, especially his parents.    There is a Romantic spirit to the book in the sense of Chris and Krakauer love living on the wild side, and being happy with very little.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|When I rented \\"Changeling\\" I had high expectations because Clint Eastwood is the director. These expectations were met. Eastwood gives us a very powerful film, which should be remembered in the many years to come.    \\"Changeling\\" is about mother Christine Collins (Jolie). One day when she comes home from work, her son Walter Collins is missing. After spending all night looking for Walter, Christine decides its time to call the Los Angeles police department, to report her missing son. After searching the police found Walter. When Christine firsts sees her found son, she realizes that the boy the police brought in is not Walter. Without giving away spoilers, Christine takes matters into her own hands, since the police insist they have found her son.  With Eastwood behind the camera, let's just say there is a big twist in the film.    \\"Changeling\\" is one of Eastwood's best directed films. The acting also is great, led by Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, and Jeffrey Donovan. The music in this film was done by Clint Eastwood, and is truly a masterpiece, which adds a lot to the film.  \\"Changeling\\" is based on a true story, which will leave you greatly satisfied.

B003NHRIUW|4.0|Sparks wrote the Screenplay as well as the Novel to \\"The Last Song\\" for Miley, whenever he pictured Ronnie in his own mind, he saw Miley. So as much as some people almost \\"beg\\" for Miley Cyrus to be replaced with someone else for the main role as Veronica \\"Ronnie\\" Miller, it wouldn't have happened - When will people ever learn that?<br /><br />Miley didn't get casted for this movie, she was SET for \\"Ronnie\\" in the very beginning - in fact the Novel wouldn't even exist without her, since the Book is based on the Movie for once and not the other way around, as it's usually the case - The Screenplay was written and the final cut fell before the actual Novel itself got finished.<br /><br />So people who praise the Book, but abandon the Movie, just because Miley Cyrus and YES, NOT someone else \\"scored\\" the lead role in it, are quite clueless - Again, Miley is the reason why \\"The Last Song\\" even exists - as a Movie AND as a Novel.<br /><br />Seriously, Sparks can't write the Screenplay AND the Novel for and with her in mind and the final movie-result itself would feature someone else in the main role, it's a no go and it's not going to happen. So if you like it or not, No Miley means No \\"The Last Song\\" - Her calls and her passion for Sparks's Books alone made both things possible.<br /><br />Of course the Book is more detailed, depper written and features more character developement/feelings, but what do you expect? - alone the unabridged Audiobook to \\"The Last Song\\" for example is nearly 12h long, while the Movie itself \\"lasts\\" 1:48 and again, it was finished BEFORE the actual Novel - Try to keep that in mind people.<br /><br />Anyways, \\"The Last Song\\" is a very nice Movie, having it's ups and downs and is in any case worth buying it on Blu-Ray/DVD for your Home-collection - The chemistry between Miley and Liam is wonderful and couldnt go any deeper (no wonder, since they are a couple in real life as well :p) and the rest of the cast does a wonderful job also, as this movie has simply a bit of everything.<br /><br />It can make you laugh, it can make you smile and it can bring you to tears - It's not a 5 star Master-piece and yes, i think it is a little bit too short with just a runtime of about 108 Minutes, compared to how thick the Novel actually is... however, it is one of the best Movies that i have seen in the Romance/Drama genre since quite a few years and therfor worth 4 good stars. Simply spoken, a well done and enjoyable thing to watch after all.<br /><br />And unlike some in here, i see no minus in Miley Cyrus taking the main part in it. She plays \\"Ronnie\\" well (while playing isn't the right word, since she actually IS Ronnie) and proves that the early \\"Hannah Montana\\" days are long gone - if you people can't (or don't want to) see that, your loss and YES, people with a \\"Anti-Miley\\" flick should NOT watch, NOR review \\"The Last Song\\", as they won't be happy and pleased with what they will see.t can make you laugh, it can make you smile and it can bring you to tears - It's not a 5 star Master-piece and yes, i think it is a little bit too short with just a runtime of about 108 Minutes, compared to how thick the Novel actually is... however, it is one of the best Movies that i have seen in the Romance/Drama genre since quite a few years and therfor worth 4 good stars.

Those who can't get the ending of Lost are like tourists who go on vacation and see wonderful things but can't appreciate the beauty because they need someone to explain everything to them.
014241493X|3.0|There were parts of this book that I absolutely loved, but there were also parts of the book were I wish John Green either didn't put in or wrote differently. Paper Towns is funny, compelling, thought provoking, and adventurous.<br /><br />Paper Towns is divided into three parts: The Strings, The Grass, and The Vessel. Each section has its own quirkiness and excitement that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In the first section, the Strings, you meet Quentin Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman. They are both in high school but aren't necessarily friends with one another. They have been neighbors since they were young and Quentin (Q) has had a crush on Margo ever since he could remember. But one night, Margo surprises Q at his bedroom window and takes him on an adventure/revenge trip of a lifetime. He believes this is a starting point for their friendship to blossom but the next day at school makes him rethink that thought.<br /><br />The second section, The Grass, is kind of the mystery part of the book. Q and his friends plus a few of Margo's friends try to uncover the secrets of Margo and what made her do what she did. This is the part of the book that is extremely thought provoking, as you read you try and figure out the clues along with Q and the gang. I was determined to uncover Margo's secrets before Q, but that didn't work out so well. Q definitely has a knack for discovering things that other people cannot.<br /><br />The third section, The Vessel, is probably the funniest part of the book. Q and the gang are on a mission to get to Margo before she does anything she might later regret. This part of the book is divided up by hours and it describes the roadtrip to Margo. There are definitely some hilarious parts in this section, but also in the sections before.<br /><br />The really big problem I have with this book is the ending. It was a decent ending, but I guess I expected something a lot more intense. But this ending is good with the fact that the reader can kind of guess what happens with Q and Margo.<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy reading this book. It had many great qualities and John Green wrote another winner. I believe most young adults would enjoy this book, especially if they are looking for something just a little bit different than what they are used to reading.with Q and Margo.

0061914177|5.0|Gary Vaynerchuk is a living example of the value of understanding and focusing on your passion. This book covers how the modern connectedness the internet and social networks in particular allow businesses to connect with customers in ways unheard of just a few years ago. Three points from this book that I found very refreshing:    1. He's clear that you need to work hard to be successful (No \\"4 minute workday\\" here...)    2. He's clear that you can make a good living following your passion but will not necessarily get rich. He also is clear how that's not the point.    3. He states that you've got to have patience and be diligent over time to get the results you want.    This book does not have tons of detail, but he'd clear to direct you to where you can get the detailed background material with step-by-step guidance. I think he chose just the right level of detail to help those interested in using social media to build a solid business.    So refreshing! A great book!

015670160X|5.0|No lover in the world ever wrote a valentine more exquisite than Virginia Woolf's tribute to her lover Vita Sackville-West. That tribute was \\"Orlando: A Biography,\\" a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders -- and Woolf's writing reaches a new peak as she explores the hauntingly sensuous world of Orlando.<br /><br />Orlando was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite (and briefly lover). His passionate, curious personality attracted many other women over the years -- until he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial but faithless Russian princess (supposedly based on Sackville-West's ex-girlfriend). Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.<br /><br />But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life -- and discovers that women aren't quite as different from men as she once thought.<br /><br />\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a very weird book, and was even more so when it was written since \\"magical realism\\" didn't exist as a literary style in 1928. Virginia Woolf makes no explanations about Orlando's immortality or unexpected gender switch. It's simply accepted that once he was a man, and then she became a woman, and that s/he has lived from the Elizabethan era until at least the 1920s (and who knows, maybe Orlando still wanders among us?).<br /><br />And Woolf's writing is at its peak here. Her prose is soaked in luxurious descriptions that constantly tease the senses -- silver and gold, frozen flowers, crystalline ice, starlight and the exquisite expanses of nature's beauty. At times the sensual writing seems almost feverish, and Woolf adds an almost mythic quality by inserting spirits of feminine virtues (Modesty, Purity and Chastity appear to try to hide Orlando's feminine body), and by having her hero/ine encounter great poets, queens and men of the sea.<br /><br />And Orlando him/herself is a truly fascinating character -- s/he can be sweet, passionate, romantic, wild and melancholy, and s/he has an almost magnetic charisma. He starts off the story as an elusive romantic teenager, suffers a heartbreak that matures him as an artist, and post-metamorphosis she becomes a woman of the modern world. Both in mind and body, Orlando is a very different woman at the end than the boy s/he began as.<br /><br />\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a truly spellbinding book -- Virginia Woolf's prose enthralls the senses while her main character explores the boundaries of gender.

B002DKGWSE|5.0|For most horror fans, Wes Craven's landmark introduction to cinema The Last House On the Left is one of the most infamous titles in movie history.  The gritty, documentry style movie about the vicious murder of two American teenage girls and the ultimate revenge on their murderers by the parents of one of them is just as real and just as disturbing today as it was back in the 70's.  Now comes the '08 take on the story.<br /><br />  The story basically remains the same.  Two girls make a mistake of buying weed off a total stranger and are kidnapped by a gang of criminals on the lam.  Over the course of one afternoon, the girls are taken out into the woods where one girl is murdered via a graphic gutting and her friend, Mari, is raped and left for dead.  But then a major storm breaks and the gang has to seek shelter at a nearby house.  To bad for them the house belongs to Mari's parents and that Mari has a strong will to survive.  And once Mari's parents find out the truth about their new houseguests, they will make sure that they regret ever stepping inside their home.<br /><br />  What can I say that other viewers haven't already stated.  This remake is without a doubt one of the best remakes in this current trend.  It remains faithful to the source material while adding enough of its own twists and turns to make it able to stand up on its own.  The acting is top knotch with kudos going out to Sara Paxton (Aquamarine, \\"The Beautiful Life: TBL\\") as Mari.  Make no mistake, the movie is hardcore.  It takes no prisoners.  It forces us to watch the events unfold no matter how intense it steadily grows.  The rape (esp. in the UNRATED cut) is graphic and uncomfortable.  And the blood does flow, not as much as in, say, Hostel or Saw, but just enough to make us feel dirty.<br /><br />  In the end, I would have to say that 2008's The Last House On the Left will no doubt become a classic.  Mr.Craven, himself, says that this new cut is better then his.  My only complaint is with Universal for once again releasing a dvd/blu-ray with basically no extra features.  We get a two or three short deleted scenes that adds nothing to the movie and a misleading featurette \\"A Look Inside\\" which is only a three minute trailer intercutted with short tidbits by Mr.Craven, Mr.Cunningham, and director Dennis Iliadis.  And for blu-ray fans, you only get \\"My Scenes\\", \\"BD LIVE\\", \\"D-Box Motion Control\\", and the inevitable \\"Digital Copy\\", you know, standard Universal crap.  How about a commentary or a featurette about how this cult classic came to be remade?  Maybe even the actual trailer?  Surely Universal is not financially strapped to put out a halfway decent disc for fans of both Last House and DVD/Blu-ray alike.ersal for once again releasing a dvd/blu-ray with basically no extra features.

It has been widely agreed upon, for a very long time now, in the business world, that the two greatest motivators are Fear and Greed (\\"Carrots and Sticks\\")  Pink argues to the contrary and presents a new set of motivators. He does so in his book in a rational way that is very pleasant to read.  Pink elegantly and gradually brings his message to the reader by supporting his claim with a variety of examples and facts, primarily with research and studies of highly regarded scholars.  Science has known about this for a while but the business world has not yet acted accordingly.     It absolutely makes sense and you get it.  The book made me reflect on some of my own experiences in a new light.   Towards the end of the book, Pink offers the reader a toolkit with some practical tips.   Pink is not just talking about a theory but, as in many good books, he leads you to assess your life and to how you can make it better.
030726999X|5.0|Salander was in quite a state when we left her in The Girl Who Played With Fire. What will become of her?  How will she recover?  Will she retain her \\"special skills?\\" Will her father survive?  What about that goofy half-brother of hers?  Will they find him?  How will her relationship to Blomkvist end? Will they stay friends, lovers? How about the folks at Millenium and Berger? Will Salander embrace the chance to fight against the establishment?<br /><br />All of these questions and more are answered in the same fast-paced, witty, sensitive, clever style which has made this trilogy and particularly these characters super-successful. I only wish there could be more books to come. I will miss Mr. Larsson's writing.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|By the time Train of Thought came out I was already a fan o fDT, having been introduced to them, as usual, by my younger brother. Over the many years of our mutual quest for the best in recorded rock music, he has turned me on to everyone from Mahavishnu Orchestra to Joe Satriani and Gary Hoey. 'Train' was the first DT album I bought without a recommendation. By then I had learned that, indeed, it takes multiple listens to really 'get' a DT album and I resigned myself to do the same on this one. As I was idly listening to Train for the 3rd or 4th time, headphones on while working on a graphics project, the majesty and drama of this album suddenly came over me. It happened during the suite 'Train of Thought', and it seemed as though finally \\"all those notes\\" came together in unison, like a translation of a previously unintelligible language. From that point I listened to the album repeatedly for weeks. The musical resolve at the end of that particular piece is literally the most satisfying album experience I had in the last decade. I have since listened to every DT album and seen them live three times. And for the record, I am 56 years old, and played the LA rock scene for real in the 80's. I've seen and heard a lot of extremely hot bands and been in a few myself. I count Kelly Clarkson, Nick Drake, Foo Fighters and Lacuna Coil among my CD collection, along with Black Sabbath (Dio) and Paramore - believe it or not - but Dream Theater reigns supreme, and notwithstanding their subsequent works, Train of Thought has got to be a registered masterpiece at some point in time. Like the previous reviewer says, it breaks down to percentages, and for some of those on the fence about any DT album, my best advice is to take that album and listen....and listen. When it hits you it will be like an epiphany of inspiration, or at the very least like biting into a really good hot dog at a place you never knew existed.   -Cyranobob

030726999X|4.0|This book started out a bit slow because there were many details from the previous book to clean up.  But, just like Larsson's other two books, once Lisbeth Salander gets into the picture the plot explodes and takes you along with it.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|I've been looking for a soft case for my little Coolpix, so when Vine offered this case, I gladly took it.  Here's my take on the AmazonBasics Camera Case:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1. Very soft.  While a hard case offers great protection, it can be uncomfortable to carry around.  This case is comfortable to carry on your belt or on a clip while keeping dirt and scratches away from your camera.<br /><br />2.  Flexible.  This case not only fits my Coolpix but my slightly larger Canon as well.<br /><br />3.  Big pockets for my extra memory and batteries.  The lack of space for necessary accessories has been my big complaint about my other camera cases, but now I can carry it all in one package, one behind the main space, another on the outside.<br /><br />4.  Multiple ways to attach the case.  Slide it on a belt or use the metal ring to secure it to on a clip.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1.  If I were to request one additional feature, it would be extra padding on the folding top.  The body of the case is nicely padded but the top is a bit thin for my taste.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend this case to anyone who wants to carry and protect their small digital camera.  It solves problems other cases don't.<br /><br />Four and 1/2 stars!
B003J27WFW|5.0|For RUSH fans this film will complete the circle for you.  It was very interesting to hear the struggle between the band's vision and what the record company wanted them to produce.  We've all heard the music, but never understood the balls the band had for producing the music they wanted to share.  I could keep writing, but all you need to know is that if you are a RUSH fan, you will need to see this.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|From the mind of Vince Gilligan and presented by AMC, \\"Breaking Bad\\" stars Bryan Cranston (previously known to avid television viewers as Hal from [[ASIN:B00006G8J7 Malcolm in the Middle]] and Tim Whatley from [[ASIN:B000VECAEE Seinfeld]]) as Walter White, a middle-aged, down-on-his-luck chemistry teacher who is handed a death sentence when he is told he has lung cancer. Burnt out from trying to reach his students and from working his dead-end second job at the local car wash, Walt reconnects with a delinquent ex-student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) in an effort to cook up the very potent and very dangerous drug, crystal meth and earn some extra cash for his family on his way out. Dealing with drug-lords and various criminals proves to be challenging, but more-so is his effort to conceal himself from his wife (Anna Gunn), his special-needs son (RJ Mitte) and his brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris), who just so happens to be a DEA agent.<br /><br />The image that graces the DVD cover features Walt in his tidey-whities, carrying a gun, and goes a long way to sum up the character, which is to say that he is an every-man pushed to a life of crime which may or may not suite him. Despite his untapped brilliance, Walt is average in almost every way. A life of regret precedes him, as he has settled for mediocrity time and time again, letting opportunities pass him by. We get glimpses of this throughout the seven episodes of the first season and come to understand how an extreme midlife crisis could push a man to this point. Although Walt is hardly sympathetic past the first few episodes, he is, at the end of the day, completely human and is brought to life brilliantly by Cranston, who no doubt has found the role he was born to play. Likewise, his co-hort in Jesse Pinkman is played all too naturally by Paul, and when the two share a scene, their chemistry, for lack of a better term, is pure and undeniable. This is, hands down, the most interesting couple on television at the moment with two actors in their prime.<br /><br />All seven episodes of the first season are compiled on this set, in all of their uncensored glory. Seeing as how it normally airs on Sunday nights at 10 pm, they tend to get away with a lot, and the boundaries they push make one wonder how this ended up on cable and not on HBO or Showtime where it would be more at home. The show itself is very cinematic, especially the first episode, which on its own, could make one heck of a feature film. Although seven episodes doesn't seem like a lot, each one packs a punch, and proves to be nearly impossible to put down. In addition to the episodes, we are treated to two commentary tracks, an inside look at the show (which is compiled of interview and behind the scene snippets that originally aired on AMC and its website), screen tests, deleted scenes and a round-table interview with Gilligan, Cranston and poducer Mark Johnson. While the features are plentiful, they still leave a bit to be desired. However, the show itself is more than enough entertainment, so the rest is just icing on the cake. \\"Breaking Bad\\" is, quite simply, the best show on television right now, and once you get a taste, you'll be hooked.th two actors in their prime.

B001CEE1YE|5.0|This is a great trilogy for Matrix fans made more fabulous in Blu-ray.  I debated between the Complete Trilogy and the Ultimate Trilogy and I am glad I didn't choose the Ultimate because while I really enjoy watching the movies, I am just not into all the background information and video game that is included in the 10 disc Ultimate.  I would recommend the Complete Trilogy for the casual Matrix fan who just enjoy the movies and don't want to be overloaded with the details.

B002VPE1XY|5.0|When I pulled this little camera case out of its box, I immediately thought it was going to be too small for my Fujifilm FinePix Z700EXR camera, but it fit perfectly! This is a sturdy, classy, soft-leather case with soft grey suede inside. The little inside pocket for carrying an extra battery is tight and out of the way; I'll probably use it to put identification inside in case I ever leave the camera lying on a table somewhere. With my camera's side strap sticking out of one side (which I prefer to running it through the top hole because access is quicker), it's like a little mini-purse. The cutout in the top happens to be right over the USB cable port on my camera, so if I had to (but I probably won't), I could run the USB cable to it without removing the camera from its case. Another thing I could do if I wanted to is use that little hole to loop an ID tag or small ID/credit card holder through using one of those beaded lamp-pull type thingies. Then I really could travel light.<br /><br />Little things mean a lot to me, and I have to say I just love the magnetic clasp underneath the low-key silverish AmazonBasics logo on the front of the case. The magnet is not so strong as to be annoyingly hard to pull apart, but it's strong enough to do the job without slipping. The little circular magnetic piece in the clasp has a small center button that fits into a recession in the other part of the clasp; when closing the cover, you hear a satisfying little click when you slide it into place, so you know it's snugly closed.<br /><br />I was thinking when I got this (not paying great attention) that the holder \\"clip\\" on the back was actually a clip suitable for clipping to the edge of your pants or a coat pocket, but it's not. It's actually better than that, because we all know how quickly those clips break off our cell phones. This one closes with strong velcro so you can loop it through a belt loop or other strap or onto a belt. The part of the holder that does not have velcro on it is not quite an inch wide, though, so it wouldn't work as well with wider belts. With the camera in it, it would be too heavy (at least for me) to want to wear around your neck, but you could definitely put it on a lanyard if you wanted to&mdash;and then perhaps stick it in a breast pocket so it's not dangling. One nice thing about the velcro is that, even though it is sewn on very well, part of the piece that is sewn to the camera case actually lifts up as you pull the velcro apart. This should extend the life of the case because you're not pulling against case stitching when you're trying to get it apart. This is not wimpy velcro, so you have to tug a bit to get it open.<br /><br />I really like it!elcro on it is not quite an inch wide, though, so it wouldn't work as well with wider belts.

B0007TKNCY|5.0|I'm kind of shocked that this film did so poorly upon the time of its release.  Watching it now, it really holds up as funny, intriguing and charming.  I personally love those 30's screwball comedies, and this film is certainly one of them.  The slick combination of Hepburn, Grant and that giant cat, as well as witty banter and slaphappy character development help create a highly energized and highly memorable comedic experience.<br /><br />And to think Katherine Hepburn hadn't done comedy before this!<br /><br />First and foremost, this film is not about a baby.  I thought it was.  Well, at first I thought it was and then I saw a still of Hepburn and a leopard and I thought that maybe the `baby' in the title referred to Hepburn herself.  Nope; the baby is actually Baby, the name of the leopard that Hepburn's character, Susan, comes into possession of.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a paleontologist named David Huxley whose whole purpose in life is to finish this Brontosaurus that he has been working on for years.  He is awaiting a special bone needed to complete it, and while his wedding is set for the next day, nothing can interfere with his work (according to his fianc&eacute;e).  In an attempt to get some money from a wealthy (prospective) investor, David winds up running into the eccentric Susan and, through a series of mishaps, he finds himself consumed with her company for an entire weekend.  Oh, and Susan has a leopard she's not quite sure what to do with.<br /><br />The film can be over-the-top but I never found this a distraction.  Some have mentioned that they found this film annoying and not funny at tall, and I can see that to a degree, but it all has to do with your taste, and I found this very entertaining.<br /><br />What makes this film work so well is the impeccable timing (and chemistry) between the two leads.  I consistently find myself eating crow when it comes to Katherine Hepburn.  I have noted that I find her overrated, but that was a LONG time ago and almost every new film I see of hers I have to eat my words because she is rather remarkable.  Her performance here is outstanding, and Cary Grant is at his best here.  I'm glad he kind of played against type, and it worked for him.  His comedic timing is just brilliant here.  They make a dynamic pair.  Charlie Ruggles and May Robson are also top notch here, layering their supporting roles with needed humor.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't catch the technical follies in the film (the split screen supposedly doesn't line up in every shot) so that shows how engrossed I was to the point of obliviousness.see of hers I have to eat my words because she is rather remarkable.

B00005JNS0|1.0|I have a huge problem with this movie.  As was brought to my attention by a fellow Ammy buddy, I do tend to be extra harsh to films that seem to get `undeserved' praise and attention.  I feel at times like I need to knock them down a peg.  I think that, for the most part, the world agrees that `Cars' is one of Pixar's weakest films.  They may not loathe it as I do, but I don't think anyone is going to try and make a case for `Cars' being a better film than `Up' or `Finding Nemo'.  What I find upsetting is that people actually like this film at all.<br /><br />It's not funny, it's not witty, it's not charming, it's not fresh, it's not exciting, it's not really much of anything other than a complete waste of time.<br /><br />UGH, I hate this movie.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a selfish hotshot race car who gets lost on his way to an important race and winds up doing some heavy damage to a road in Radiator Springs.  He can't leave until he helps fix what he's done, and in the process his eyes are opened and his life is changed (or at least his `outlook' on that life).  He meets an array of shiny (and rusty) new friends (well, not at first) who teach him some valuable life lessons.<br /><br />The film is shiny, but at the same time it is rather one-note.  The voice acting is effective, not nothing truly noteworthy.  The plot is simple and rather `cookie cutter', and that isn't helped by the lackluster script that layers that characters with clich&eacute; dialog and gags that are almost mind-numbing in their inability to illicit a genuine response from the audience (and by audience I mean ME since I am the only audience that matters in my personal opinion of this film).<br /><br />In a word, this film is just `boring'.

B0017V7GTY|5.0|In 2008 Gaslight Anthem released their 2nd album \\" '59 Sound\\".  This CD brings together both their early punkroots with the sound of early Springsteen.  If the world was fair this band would be one of the top  bands selling out stadiums, but we live in a plastic world full of dance-rap and American Idol worship!  Key tracks are:  Damn it, the whole thing is GREAT.  If you ever see this band in your area check them out.
B0039TD826|3.0|I've gone back and forth between the 1994 Virgin Remaster and the 2010 Remaster. They are definitely not the same. I had no problems with the 1994 remaster. The 2010 Remaster is immediately louder, which makes you think it might be better. But everything sounds compressed and pushed up front. The original album is kind of murky and swampy and I think that is captured better on the 1994 remaster. On 'Rocks Off' Bill Wyman's rubbery bass has more presence on the 1994 Remaster. I'm also not picking up the little Nicky Hopkins piano flourishes or the copper blast when the horns kick in on the 2010 remasters. In general I've liked the 1994 Virgin Remasters on the whole post-Allen Klein catalogue. I was hoping the 2010 Exile Remasters would spread out and let us hear more, but it seems everything is strangled up front and subtlety be damned. Too bad.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I couldn't pass up this deal on Amazon. My viewing of Firefly on Blu-ray was my second time watching the full season of the show and it was every bit as enjoyable as the first. The sound quality was fantastic. This remains one of my favorite shows of all time and I always become sad when I near the end of the season and realize there won't be a second season. What I noticed while watching this time was how exceptional the dialogue was. I haven't seen anything that balances witty humor and serious drama as well as Firefly. If you haven't seen it you should definitely check it out.     My only complaint, and it is very minor and has nothing to do with the show itself, is that the Blu-Ray box says there are 3 never before seen episodes. Well, it is only partially true. The episodes never aired in the first run, but they are on the DVD set which is where I watched it the first time, and I think they aired on Sci-fi too. Anyway, I just got really excited when I thought I was going to get 3 episodes I had never seen, but that wasn't the case. Still doesn't stop me from giving 5+ stars, just something that i thought could have been worded better on the box.

1905113153|5.0|If it were possible to give this 10 stars, I would do so in a heartbeat. This is definitely one of the best royal icing instruction books in which I have had the pleasure to learn; I joyfully add this to what I thought was a pretty complete library of royal icing instruction until this came along.<br /><br />Having several volumes of royal icing volumes in my baking library, I wasn't quite sure if I needed this particular book to add to it. But never one to turn away from any baking source without giving it a good glance, I was extremely happy to have gotten this. It is not one that seems to be easily accessible, and to that point, I needed to purchase this through a seller rather directly through our friends here at Amazon. I would hope they would rethink that option and add this to their selections.<br /><br />This is a large, heavy, luxurious, and voluminous book of royal icing education; to say that it has everything, is an understatement. You are given what seems to be, for intermediate cake decorating folks like myself, a thorough and precise methodology of how to use and create detailed, exquisite, and delicate works of art using a most friendly medium. To which point, I would say that this also incorporates much of the Australian/Lambeth style of cake decorating to which so many wish to aspire.<br /><br />The author/instructor is one Eddie Spence, who hails from Edinburgh, and through most humble of beginnings, made his way to Master Baker with all the accomplishments, glories, and accolades befitting of such a man. His list of clients range from the commoner to royalty, even making the wedding cake for Prince Charles and Princess Diana. His love and passion for this art has garnered him much deserved praise as well as a following by students who stand in line to be in his classes.<br /><br />As stated previously, the book is large and heavy with chapter divided into Basics, Tutorials, Cake Tops, and Cake Projects. The photography is wonderful, and while always welcoming more, most of the photo's are large, very close-up, and detailed. The weights and measurements are both in metric and English; every once in a while you might find a difference in terminology, but not so much so that you wouldn't understand. That is why I feel that this would be an excellent book for intermediate to advanced students, though a novice would find this a real treasure after doing some thorough reading and perhaps have another reference book on the side.<br /><br />The Contents are:<br /><br />The Biography of Eddie Spence; Before you begin anything, this part is a \\"must\\" read. In order to both understand and appreciate the man and his immense talent, you need to understand where he began, how his life and experiences shaped him, how he became the Master that he is now, as well as who, what, and how events influenced him. I found this part fascinating, as only a \\"baking foodie\\" would!<br /><br />PREPARATION AND BASICS<br />Equipment and Edibles: It is deeply appreciate when a numbered listing of equipment or ingredients is displayed along with a corresponding photograph of same said equipment. The \\"Edibles\\" are edible products used in making royal icing projects, such as glazes, marzipan, egg whites, food colorings, etc.<br /><br />Recipes: He uses a good, rich fruitcake as the foundation for his projects. There are many other batters that one can use so this is obviously something left for the baker to decide. There is also information on prepping and baking of the batter, portion guide, how to cut a cake depending on it's shape, and a wonderful size chart that gives you the quantities of batter needed, dependent on the shape and size of the cake; an invaluable guide. Now, as for the Royal Icing itself, there are 2 types you can use (dried egg whites or fresh egg whites). I was duly educated on the 5 types of Royal Icing possible, all dependent on what project you have in mind and the type of fluidity or stiffness needed for the project.There is also space dedicated to the difference of using either machine or hand-beating in making Royal Icing.<br /><br />Techniques: The basics of torting and covering cakes with marzipan, royal icing, or sugarpaste. How to make \\"plaques\\", how to make and fill a piping bag, coloring with food colors, doweling a cake, and gilding round out this section.<br /><br />TUTORIALS:<br />This is the heart and soul of the finesse of Royal Icing artwork and is the section that I spend the most time reading, learning, and enjoying. It would take pages of space to adequately describe everything so I will be brief.<br /><br />Pressure Piping: Delicate flowers like lily-of-the-valley and roses, grapevines, doves, doves in flight, doves holding delicate ribbons in their beaks, swans, mother swan and duckling scenes, stork with baby; this was just exquisite work!<br /><br />Combining Drop Line Work with Pressure Piping: Linework like scrolls, scallops, C-scrolls, S-scrolls, 3-D flowers, 3-D piped baskets (wow!), etc<br /><br />Scrolls: Further sudy on greater scroll and rope work; building on scroll work<br /><br />Pressure Piped Figures and Motifs: Ducks, horses, eagles, lambs, baby booties, Christmas trees<br /><br />Piped Flowers using an Icing Nail: Beautiful and delicate flowers built on flower nails<br /><br />Lettering and Numerals: The beautiful and delicate ability of numbers and letter that remind one of Victorian cakes and pastries.<br /><br />Run-outs and Collars: people, architecture of building a gazebo's using netting, those lovely stand-out collars on cakes that look too perfect to be real.<br /><br />Embroidery Techniques: How to make projects look \\"embroidered\\".<br /><br />Oriental String Work: Making absolute beautiful \\"fences\\" of royal icing to surround a cake! Exquisite fantasy!<br /><br />Extension Work: This chapter made it all complete; learning the Australian Method/Lambeth Method! Lovely and fine bridgework and extension lines!<br /><br />CAKE TOPS: How tomake those lovely cake tops with scenes for special occasions such as birthdays, holidays, etc. The one that captured my heart is a 3-D scene of a yellow baby chick in a pink flowered-covered bonnet, walking along a sun-filled grassy path, with a little budding/flowering tree behind her and a small little brown fence ahead of her with \\"Happy Easter\\" wishes written so delicately on the top. Or perhaps a musical stave with notes and wishes for a \\"Merry Christmas\\" with 3-D flowers, or a smiling Santa perched on atop \\"Christmas Greetings\\".<br /><br />CAKE PROJECTS: Lovely wedding and party cakes to desire and inspire.<br /><br />TEMPLATES<br /><br />TROUBLESHOOTING<br /><br />GLOSSARY<br /><br />INDEX<br /><br />SUPPLIERS<br /><br />Yes, I am a cake-decorating fool and I give no apologies. This was yet another wonderful book that needs to be a part of your cake library. You will make this one of your most treasured acquirements. Thank you so much Mr. Spence!!

B001DJ7PR8|1.0|Possibly... It seems that there is no script (everyone could have improvised the dialogs as they are so predictable, naive and silly). There is no catch in the beginning of the film (yes, the film has a weak, weak  start). The narrator'a voice is such a poor choice. The only thing that keeps you watching is the beauty of Barcelona.      No one seems to be able to act in this film either. You want me to believe that Bardem is seducing all these women? Give me a break! He lacks any charisma in this film!     Penelope is the only one who stands out. I'm not her fan, but in this film she is the only person who brings some life to the badly-performed story - from the first few minutes she appears on the screen.     I would say: don't waste your time. This is one of the many films that can be easily skipped - missed - forgotten.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|Early this year, I discovered to my delight that DEVO was releasing a new album on my birthday.  \\"Holy Crap\\" I thought, and for once, I had something to look forward to in the middle of June.  DEVO has been part of my life since I first heard Dr. Demento play \\"Jocko Homo\\" on his syndicated radio show back around 1978.  I still have my original vinyls of \\"Are We Not Men,\\" \\"Duty Now For The Future,\\" and \\"Oh No, It's DEVO.\\"  Finding other outcasts who liked DEVO in the hair-metal-heavy environment of early 1980s New Orleans meant that an outcast like me could find friends.  There would practically be no MTV without DEVO - their videos were on heavy rotation for years, back when people got excited over Patty Smythe videos, and well before the \\"Thriller\\" era.  Gerald Casale was even nice enough to give me permission to show their video \\"Beautiful World\\" to a class I taught, and yes, Bob Mothersbaugh autographed my piece of crap Datsun back around 1998 and bought my girlfriend and I a beer.  I still feel like a dork for staring at him but hey, those guys were important to me.  I still say that when the history of those bands who began in the 1970s is written (and as a historian, I wouldn't mind contributing to it), DEVO will come out as one of the most enduring, diverse, and creative bands that the United States has ever produced.  For those of you who doubt this, Ryko had a 2-cassette volume of Devo rarities that I completely wore out.  You think that they lacked chops and that punk edge?  Listen to tapes made back when they were working in and around Akron - they were tight as hell and were also primarily guitar-based.  Bob Mothersbaugh is a very underrated guitarist, and those guys rocked as hard as anybody.  They were innovators, they were commentators, and they were, and are, damned-fine musicians.    So albums came and went, and DEVO changed over time up to the release of \\"Smoothnoodlemaps\\" (don't remember that one?  Neither does anyone else - but I still bought it- not their best).  It seemed that the brothers Mothersbaugh and Casale were content with glomming onto the Lolapalooza and reunion tour schtick, and doing movie and TV soundtracks (are you listening Danny Elfman?).  I have the live video of a recent DEVO show done before a half-empty arena, and the members later acknowledging that the audience didn't quite get them.  It made me want to cry.  DEVO isn't allowed to get old, for Bob's sake!  Who is going to warn us that we are getting too doggone dumb for our own good?  Frank Zappa is gone, Oing Boingo is gone, and most of the others who could needle us good in our comfort areas have thrown in the towel (for the record, let me state that I don't think that Zappa ever \\"got\\" DEVO, but then again, no one is perfect.)  I was afraid that DEVO would disappear.  Then this album got made.     I'm not going to run it down track by track, because I don't want to and it isn't neccessary.  This is not old DEVO.  People who say that are deceived by the \\"Whip It\\" drum beat on one track, and the drum-machine-sounding rythmns throughout.  Old DEVO had the great Alan Myers banging the skins, and later, the pads (although to be fair, I saw them with David Kendrick and I thought they sounded great).  People are making a big deal about them making a 1980s-style record.  This is hogwash - it doesn't sound like 1980s DEVO, nor does it sound like A Flock of Seagulls or Duran Duran.  There is some throwback, but it sounds like nothing on \\"Oh No,\\", nor \\"Duty Now For The Future,\\" \\"New Traditionalists,\\" \\"Freedom Of Choice,\\" or \\"Shout.\\"  No, this is different.  Very different.  And I like it for what it is.    I don't know what DEVO is becoming.  I never did, and that was what makes them fun.  This album still perplexes me - I don't really know what to think - and maybe that is the point.  It has stuff that I really like, and some stuff that I am sort of indifferent to, but not displeased with.  The tracks are all interesting; the music is good.Personally, I'd love to see them release an album that was less electronic and more guitar, bass, and drum-oriented, because I think that \\"Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are DEVO\\" is one of the most significant rock albums of the 20th century - but hey, I'm a fan.  DEVO is changing again.  I like this album.  I hope that you will too.  De-evolution is very real, people.        We Must Repeat...
B00006IUIG|5.0|\\"81/2\\" doesn't require my review to retain its place as a standard for film excellence.  i saw it when it 1st came out in 1963; i was 16 and knew then i was in the presence of something extraordinary.  after dozens of viewings over the last 45 years, it still holds up.  in fact i continue to discover nuances in each scene.  it seems my own maturity enables me to appreciate the film even more.  viewing \\"81/2\\" now on its own terms should enrich the understanding of any viewer committed to experiencing film.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|After 3 years of BREAKING BAD, I'm still amazed and bemused that I've grown to care so very much about a meth manufacturer and his messed-up, addictive young assistant.  In Season One, Walter White (Bryan Cranston, in one of the best performances of the decade) was a mild-mannered high school science teacher who finds out he's likely dying of cancer, and uses his knowledge of chemistry to concoct a really excellent form of meth.  He turns to a former student and druggie, Jesse (Aaron Paul, in one of the other great performances of the decade) to help him sell the stuff.  The two form an awkward bond, punctuated by nearly comedic moments when their ineptitude causes endless trouble for them.  Walt struggles to hide his double life from his wife Skylar, his sickly teenage son and his brother-in-law Hank, who happens to be a DEA agent.<br /><br />In Season Two, the success of Walt's meth draws unwanted attention from various law enforcement types, as well as those on the wrong side of the law.  Walt's secret becomes harder to hide, and Jesse and Walt grow estranged as several bad turns force a wedge between them.  Jesse falls in love, but he and his girl, a recovering addict, don't exactly help each other out.  Walt & Jesse are further \\"assisted\\" by a new attorney (Bob Odenkirk, offering probably the only comic relief to be found anymore) who tried hard to help these two launder their money.  The season ends badly, with tragedies both personal and widespread...and Walt's marriage is in shambles.<br /><br />Season 3 introduces us to a new Walt, one that has been evolving since the beginning.  He's now a hardened criminal, still showing his mild-mannered side...but also fully turned over to his darkness.  In Season Two, he committed a couple of acts that were so horrific that he can no longer really look himself in the mirror and see the \\"good guy\\" he once was.  He partners with a local drug kingpin (wonderfully played by Giancarlo Esposito) and begins to manufacture on a scale he had scarcely imagined possible.  Jesse struggles with loss and addiction, and it's a long time before these two old partners come together again.<br /><br />There are many wonderful things about the show and Season 3.  First, the character evolution is better than on almost any other show on TV.  You can actually track the changes to these folks in a way that makes you realize that most other TV characters basically remain unchangeable.  You see that Walt has become a crafty \\"bad\\" guy...he has truly broken bad.  His wife has evolved.  His son.  Hank.  And poor Jesse.  They hardly resemble the characters we first met...and time has not been kind to any of them.  And with the excellent writing, directing and acting...we can practically feel the guild and corruption pouring off of them.<br /><br />The show introduces some great new characters, and develops Esposito & Odenkirk to a great extent.  I particularly enjoyed the two hit men from south of the border.  These two cousins are vicious killers who never speak a word...and you'd be hard-pressed to find two creepier characters in recent TV history.  They are introduced in the squirm-inducing first scene of the season...setting you up perfectly to be on edge for just about anything all year.  Midway through the season, Hank and these two cousins have a brief scene together that is easily among the most exciting, tense, jaw-dropping few minutes in television history.  I rarely find myself needing to yell at the television and the characters on it...but any viewer of BREAKING BAD will be hard-pressed not to jump up and down and yell.  That five minutes alone make the season worthwhile...it's almost like the final 6 minutes of SIX FEET UNDER made watching that whole series worthwhile.<br /><br />I really don't want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that Walt and Jesse are headed to some very dark places.  Walt has few redeeming qualities left to him...but his concern for the moral life of Jesse is one very touching quality he retains.  Because he feels so irredeemably corrupted himself, he \\"runs interference\\" against some of Jesse's self-destructive tendencies.  And near the end, when that concern is also twisted by fate and circumstance...it becomes almost unbearable for the viewer.  When was the last time you sat on the edge of your seat over a MORAL DILEMMA?!?!<br /><br />The quality of this show is nearly unsurpassed.  It is very thoroughly only for adults though.  There is almost no behavior to admire.  It is brutal and blunt and gritty.  (It also uses Albuquerque, my town, VERY well...which gives me an extra dose of love for the show.  We see real locations, real local restaurants, even real local pizza carryout joints.)  But it is so tightly constructed from both a plot and character standpoint that it provides intelligent, gripping entertainment.  And the work of Aaron Paul, and particularly Bryan Cranston, is so superb that any appreciator of fine acting really should tune in.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the show before, PLEASE go back and start from the beginning.  It truly has been like one long journey, and it begs to be appreciated from its starting point.  But for heaven's sake, SEE IT!use he feels so irredeemably corrupted himself, he \\"runs interference\\" against some of Jesse's self-destructive tendencies.

B00005JLD4|3.0|I was going to rate the film four stars until I read some of the less flattering reviews.  Apparently this story was not completely factual.    It is fascinating to watch mostly because of the good choice of actresses for the three runaway Aborigine girls; they are quite charming and pretty, espcially the little one who plays Daisy.  Their perservence in an extremely difficult 1000 mile trek across the Australian desert to find their mother is nothing less than heroic.    It did trouble me that the characters were generally stereotypes.  I'm not familiar with what actually happened in that time and place so I can't say.  I do encourage people who take this situation seriously to do research and discover what really happened, instead of taking this film as factual.
B003MWHVLY|3.0|A lot of the reviews posted from this album thus far on Amazon seem to be from fans of Sia - which is fine, but my review is from the perspective of someone who has just come upon Sia so may be a bit different. The single \\"Clap Your Hands\\" is what attracted me to Sia. The song and the video that followed definitely felt offbeat and fresh, two things that do not tend to get a lot of attention in the U.S. market these days. I decided to give the entire album a chance and am on the fence about it. 'We Are Born' seems to be a concept album - just by the artwork alone you get the sense of Sia and her music being a bit playful, fun and child-like. 'We Are Born' feels like an album that musically explores the innocence, fun and freedom that comes with childhood and the burden, heartbreak and angst that comes with getting older and dealing with changing relationships.<br /><br />The Good: The 'child' part of the album, being mostly the first half, is exceptionally good and fun. These tracks are spontaneous, fun and straight-up dance inspiring. \\"The Fight\\" sets up this inner conflict between the kid and adult that we'll deal with the whole album; \\"Clap Your Hands\\" is all about having fun and letting go; \\"Stop Trying\\" is another of the albums' best tracks, with kids in the background singing \\"we are you!\\" as if to aid in the rebellion of getting older and letting life and troubles get the best of you. There are other uptempo tracks including \\"Bring the Night\\" that make the album stand out as being creative and unique.<br /><br />The Bad: The so-called \\"down-tempo\\" tracks aren't necessarily bad but to me don't go well with the tracks mentioned above. These tracks feel like the 'adult' tracks, showing off a more mature sound and dealing with grown-up issues like heartbreak, relationships gone sour and life getting a bit more complicated with age. \\"Be Good To Me\\" is a sultry song where Sia pleads with her lover to stand by her and how she'll be dedicated to him for doing so; \\"You've Changed\\" has Sia commenting on how a man she's known since childhood has actually gotten better with age; \\"Big Girl Little Girl\\" has the carefree 'fun' persona that was present in the dance tracks lecturing the older, burdened adult on the down-tempo tracks that she shouldn't let life get her down. The down-tempo tracks felt a bit jarring considering they follow a slew of great dance and party numbers that are optimistic, happy and celebratory. How the album ends, with these two different sides of Sia trying to find common ground brings down the album a bit, making it something of a psycho-analytic musical journey. The last track, a cover of Madonna's \\"Oh Father\\", makes you wonder if it was just a cover thrown in to strike up interest or if, in the story arc being told through the music, if Sia's relationship woes she sings of stems from issues between father and daughter.<br /><br />In all, it's an okay album. As a new Sia fan, I can't compare it to her past works. I really enjoyed the dance/uptempo tracks because they felt carefree, fun, inspired and unlike anything considered \\"in\\" or \\"popular\\" in the U.S. market today. These tracks make Sia and her music very appealing. The down-tempo tracks with her lamenting about her relationship issues, however, feel a bit less inspired, overdone, and unexceptional. I'd get the upbeat tracks and consider skipping some of the slower numbers from this release.<br /><br />Listen to These: \\"Stop Trying\\", \\"Clap Your Hands\\", \\"Bring Night\\", \\"Oh Father\\"as Sia commenting on how a man she's known since childhood has actually gotten better with age; \\"Big Girl Little Girl\\" has the carefree 'fun' persona that was present in the dance tracks lecturing the older, burdened adult on the down-tempo tracks that she shouldn't let life get her down.

B002VT6C0K|2.0|I read a third of the book before I figured that none of the chapters were forming a plot.  I dont like the idea of a bunch of short stories in the guise of a book .  At the half way point  I am forcing myself to finish these mildly engaging short stories that are dark and disturbing.

B001FB55I0|5.0|\\"Terminator Salvation\\" is the beginning of a new saga in the \\"Terminator\\" franchise which begun in 1984 with James Cameron's hit \\"The Terminator\\". Directed by McG, this takes place fifteen years after the events of \\"Terminator: Rise of the Machines\\", which ended with the onslaught of \\"Judgment Day\\", the day when all the world's machines rose up against humanity.<br /><br />John Connor, this time played by Christian Bale, is now settled into his prophetized role as Resistance Leader/Only Hope for Humanity against the terminator machines. Yet Connor struggles with his mission as the great emancipator/warrior and Bale shows this internal strife very well. As we get to know Connor and his ragtag group of rebels, we see the two people entering his life who play major roles in his fight: Marcus, played by Sam Worthington, a death row inmate from several years ago who took part in a scientific procedure (which ended up converting him into a human/cyborg hybrid) and Kyle Reese, well portrayed by Anton Yelchin. Reese, of course, one day becomes the father of John in the earlier Terminator mythos, yet John is tasked with finding him and keeping him alive in this alternate time frame.<br /><br />Though not always as lively, fast paced as the earlier Schwarzenegger films, T-S has a few well produced set pieces (for example: the road/bridge chase involving Marcus, Reese and a couple of terminator/motorcycles; the capture of rebels by a 20 ft harvester/terminator; and Connor's battle with a Schwarzenegger cyborg lookalike). The aftermath of Judgment Day has led to his new chapter in Connor's life and his fulfillment as a savior of humanity and it somehow still works without the presence of Schwarzenegger, simply because it takes the story in a different direction and adds new layers to the original mythology.<br /><br />The Film looks great on Blu-ray: Strong visuals and a clear soundtrack do enough to enhance McG's vision. A very good addition to one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|The subject says it all. It's a quote from \\"Slow Show,\\" one of many memorable tracks on The National's follow up to the strong 2005 album \\"Alligator.\\" Boxer finds The National at a different point in their lives and improves upon the reptilian predecessor in every way. From the disney-referencing daze of the opening \\"Fake Empire\\" to the touching story of a couple that has \\"lost it\\" in \\"Start a War,\\" this album gives hope to new music. Every piece of the band has improved himself in his craft, from the rhythms to lead guitar and even the bass. Matt has stepped up his lyrical abilities and it all comes together behind the strongest part of the album, the drums. \\"Boxer\\" could almost be a reference to how the drummer \\"boxes\\" the complex and layered beats all over the place to form songs that no other band out there can touch right now. \\"Apartment Story\\" is a highlight on the album, and though I like to kid that it's about a couple trapped in their home during a zombie invasion (listen to it it actually works), I'm sure it's an ode to what could happen in a state where terrorism runs the land and people are forced into hiding.<br />I could go on and on about each individual song but there is no need to as they complement eachother so well. If you like carefully crafted music that seems simple at first until you start to pull it away piece by piece like the petals of a flower and realize that without every miniscule piece your left with a bare stem, you will understand that The National are one of th ebest bands in America right now, indie or other, and the fact that while critically they have been acclaimed but have refused to change their style simply to get on the radio is a testament to how much emotion and toil they put into each line, verse, rhythm and drum solo. This was 2007s best album, hands down. And yes, I know Arcade Fire's Neon Bible came out in 2007, as did Radioheads underappreciated In Rainbows and Sound of Silver by LCD Soundsystem, and as good as they are, Boxer knocks them out (pardon the pun).Boxer knocks them out (pardon the pun).
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a great documentary DVD that I've seen in a while. It explains the far side of the commercialized agriculture that is being done. I love all sections of the piece. Definitely it educates the consumer about how what they eat is produced. The good as well as the not so good sides of it. I used this DVD in my class to generate a discussion about the highly commercialized agriculture vs less commercialized agriculture. We all know that it's a challenge for a farmer or an agricultural operation to produce a product economically and efficiently with low cost and deliver it in the marker for a profit. This DVD deals with producing something faster, cheaper, in bulk and deliver it to the consumer oftentimes compromising environmental sustainability and consumer health. On the other hand, it also gives a great picture about how some other small scale agricultural businesses are done taking care of aforementioned problems. It also speaks well to the food safety related issue that is very important in the current time as we see a lot more plant and animal related products are being recalled than it used to be. It also has a good account on organic agriculture and how large companies grow through mergers and acquisitions. Overall, this is a job well done.
1400062756|4.0|An excellent book for anyone interested in understanding what drives specific types of behaviour in themselves and others. Far from 'pop psychology', it cites numerous academic and real life examples to clearly illustrate complex concepts in an interesting and insightful way.  Thought provoking and of practical application in both personal and professional settings, this book demonstrates the power that our internal dialogue and mindset has in all aspects of our lives.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Just finished watching the HD broadcast of \\"Rush: Beyond The Lighted Stage\\" (R:BTLS) on Palladia. Excellent documentary. Sam Dunn & Scot McFadyen are the same filmmakers behind the similarly awesome Iron Maiden doc [[ASIN:B0026MS4V2 Flight 666 ]]. \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\" is one of the better career-spanning documentaries I've seen. I like Rush, but kind of lost touch with them after 1987's \\"Hold Your Fire.\\" This film makes me want to go back and hear what I've missed.     For all the hipsters who have dismissed Rush over the years, it's awesome to see Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins), Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), Kirk Hammet (Metallica), Taylor Hawkins (Foo Fighters) and Tim Commeford (Rage Against The Machine) singing the band's praises.    \\"R:BTLS\\" gives even a casual viewer a dynamite glimpse into the life of this band that's been together since '68 and putting out albums since '74. In many ways, this film would make a great double feature with [[ASIN:B002DLB1IO Anvil: The Story of Anvil]]. Both bands that have been doing it their way for decades. Rush made it, Anvil didn't.     \\"R:BTLS\\" doesn't shy away from subjects like the tragic auto accident that took Neal Peart's daughter, or the subsequent death of his wife. As other reviewers have noted, that section of the movie is the emotional core of the whole film. Dunn and McFadyen are fans, but they're not afraid to ask why has Rush been marginalized and critically attacked over the years. They also spend time exploring Peart's aversion to meeting devoted fans.    I was really drawn into this film. No mean feat, considering this is not a story brimming with acrimony, drugs, groupies and all the other usual \\"watching a train wreck\\" staples of, say, \\"Behind The Music.\\" A band, the people around them, folks they've influenced, and their fans. And that's all that's needed for a compelling story.    Bottom line:   Just a film fan? 4 solid stars. Excellent documentary.  Music fan who likes Rush even a little? 5 stars.  Rush fan? Not enough stars in the galaxy.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast.. What can you say?  It's such a beautiful story. Disney doesn't make these anymore. A story of a friendship, love and that beauty comes from inside. The Beast who was so \\"ugly\\" had this big heart and was kind when Gaston, who was such a handsome fella that all the girls loved him, was so evil.    The songs are fantastic. Tale as old as time is one of the most beautiful songs ever.     I just.. love this movie and you won't be disappointed
0440242401|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is brilliant at this sort of fun, frothy story. This is the third novel of hers I've read and it may be my favorite so far. I love how Kinsella creates this impossible situation, makes it seem believable, then rearranges it into a different situation, and then twists it into a plausibly happy ending. The reader learns about Lexi's life along with her, sympathizing with her struggles as she tries to piece things together and become this person she no longer recognizes. The characters Kinsella creates are believable and fun--Eric, Lexi's husband, is often laugh-out-loud funny, as is her sister Amy--and although some of the situations teetered too close to slapstick, they still managed to be quite funny. I suspect from a neurological standpoint, this story is completely ridiculous, but from a reader's standpoint, it's complete fun.
B003E48AYC|5.0|Alice in Wonderland in Blu Ray did not disappoint.  The extras on the makeup and set dressing and special effects are well worth watching.  And Johnny Depp!!  The eyes on his Mad Hatter are truly a sight to behold.
B0009X7664|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is one of the few examples where novel and movie for one really have something to say and where both versions are outstanding achievements in their own field. Harper Lee's bestseller won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and the movie - made with Lee's support and produced with the same love for the material - received eight nominations for the Academy Award. The film won three, including the Best Actor Award for Gregory Peck. Peck really epitomises the role of the Southern lawyer Atticus Finch who defends a black man accused of rape, convinced of his innocence. Finch has his two children to teach values of humanity, and these are based on compassion, courage and fighting for the right cause. What makes this movie so special is that the happenings are seen through the eyes of the children rather than the adults, and thus the storytelling provides an unusual and fresh angle when we find ourselves stumbling into events and learn what's really at stake as the youngsters go along. Yet while Atticus' fight against prejudices may seem to be doomed, hope never ends - and it is a given that the viewer will walk away deeply moved by this movie.<br /><br />The plot of the movie, told in a retrospective narration, is extraordinary and entirely in the spirit of the novel, evoking the full spectrum of emotions. There's also no doubt about it that the acting is outstanding, not only as far as Peck is concerned but also the child actors, especially Mary Badham, really impress. A lot of credit has to be given to the staff as they created the kind of environment to let the children blossom. Also the black and white cinematography fits perfectly to the story and several scenes in the movie will stay in your mind for a very long time. Personally I am thankful that I got to read the novel when I was still a teenager in school - it's an educational experience one shouldn't miss. Yet I only discovered the movie version decades later, and it didn't disappoint and I learned to love the material even more.<br /><br />Especially the bonus features in this special edition are enlightening and make the experience whole. They include:<br /><br />- A Feature Commentary with Director Robert Mulligan and Producer Alan Pakula. A highly informative and yet entertaining commentary that stands high above comparable features.<br />- Making of Documentary: Fearful Symmetry (90 min.) - Provides a lot of background information, not only how the movie was made but also what it meant back then and still means today. The film also sheds light on the time and locations the characters of the movie lived in by via first hand accounts of folk who experienced it all themselves.<br />- A Conversation with Gregory Peck (97 min.) - A superb and touching documentary about Gregory Peck's life as an actor and father, especially dealing with the influence Harper Lee and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" had on it. Be assured, there's much more than just a few anecdotes to tell, and if you already like the actor, you will find this film heartwarming and love him afterwards. A must see and indispensable supplement to the movie. In this documentary Peck's achievements as an actor and his role as a father in real life stand side by side, the morality of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" resonating all the way through.<br />- Academy Award Best Actor Acceptance Speech (1:30 min.)<br />- American Film Institute Life Achievement Award (10 min.)<br />- Excerpt from Academy Tribute to Gregory Peck (10 min.)<br />- Scout Remembers (12 min.) - Mary Badham, back then child actress and one of the main characters in the movie, talks about how she became part of the movie and learned to appreciate Gregory Peck.<br />- And finally: Production Notes, Details on Cast & Film makers and a Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />In short: A brilliant movie, which made it on a DVD edition chock-full with extras leaving nothing to be desired. If you like classic movies and always wanted to know more about theirbackground, this is the one to get for your collection. 5/5 - one of the best movies of the past century.- one of the best movies of the past century.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|If you are less than 30 years old, and you dislike this album, you have no credibility.  That's not a knock on you, as it is not your fault.  The fact is, if you fit into this category, then you are not old enough to know what music even is.  The thumping bass techno-synth-drivel that passes for music these days is a joke and is unfair to those who were born too late to hear what real music is.  Talent is bypassed for a look and maybe a dance, along with a computer generated track that requires no musicianship.  These \\"artists\\" are here for 15 minutes before their act is given the \\"weakest link\\" hook.  How many recent acts (I dare not say \\"bands\\" so as to insult the real bands out there) last more than a couple of years?  Almost none now.  Thank you, record industry.  Don't develop anything, just throw out one \\"one hit wonder\\" after another. Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have had almost 35 years of relevance.  How many others can say that?  A handful at best. Take a look at the top 40 artists for the last 20 years and see how many you can (or want to) remember.  How many of them are actually musicians who can get together in a room (without PCs) and jam something meaningful?  Not too many.  Granted, the industry would prevent that from happening today.  So you youngsters are screwed unless and until the emphasis on music returns to the \\"music\\" business.  With Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, if you are old enough, you have enjoyed seeing them grow musically and as a band, year after year.  It gets to a point where you say \\"How can you still be doing this, effectively, after all this time?\\"  The love of, and being true to, the music, is why.  There is such integrity there, integrity that is unmatched in this day and age.  I will rue the day that TP&HB decides to hang it up.  If MOJO is any indication, however, I've got some time.  These guys are better than ever.  There is no denying that, if you have an appreciation for music. Go see this band in concert and you will be inspired how a group of guys approaching 60 can tear it up with the best of them.
B000UR9T82|3.0|What could arguably be one of the greatest trilogy of films(easily in superhero films)to date comes to Blu Ray in a half hearted \\"cash in\\" release. I am a huge fan of these films and I already own the 2 disc DVD releases for each of the three installments. I was hoping for a definitive Blu Ray release when I bought this, but what I got was very good transfers with no new bonus material! To make matters worse the old bonus material and commentaries for the first two films were NOT even carried over! The only extra for those two films are trailers for two other films and both the first and second discs have the same two trailers on them!<br /><br />Considering the space available on Blu Ray discs, I think this is shameful and insulting to fans. I'm all for moving forward with technology, but not at the expense of the consumer. ...so.......here we go again, first we introduce a new improved format, then we rush to release halfhearted editions, so they can release a better one a year or two later and the vicious cycle continues.<br /><br />OK so now you get past that you will be keeping your original two disc DVD's because the bonus stuff is actually very good and well worth keeping on those editions. Now we get to the transfers, all three films show a very noticeable improvement, but the standard DVD releases look very good too and I'm not sure it warrants a double dip without the extras. The first film looks a bit grainy at times, with the second film looking much better. The sound is a big improvement on all three films. I just do not understand why the bonus stuff wasn't carried over for the first two films.  It would have made considering this release to buy a much easier decision.<br /><br />My ratings for the films<br /><br />Spider Man  - 4.6<br />The first film is creaky at times, but it is so much fun that I can forgive any flaws in it. It's got great characters, action, acting and heart, it's one of the best popcorn flicks you'll ever see. Tobey McGuire may not be the wisecracking Spidey we know from the comic book, but he is completely believable as the young teen with these strange new powers. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Green Goblin even if the Goblin design could have been a little better. I also loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst, Robertson and Harris are great as M.J. and Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I know that some think there could have been a lot more development with Parker getting used to his new powers, but I believe this series was known to be a trilogy right from the get go and Raimi wanted to make Spider Man 2 all about the problems that would come with these powers and as we all know he pulled that one off in spades. When you think about the genius of how the first film was handled with Parker not giving much thought to the dangers of his new found gifts, it's a really good movie. I also love the ending of the film which I know also made all the ladies big fans of this film. There is nothing quite so bitter sweet as unrequited love. Besides being an extremely fun film it is also a very important film because super hero films were never taken too seriously until after this film made a ton of money.<br /><br />Spider Man 2 - 4.9<br /><br />Even though this is a superior film to the first, I like the first one better. That's not to say that this could quite possibly be the greatest super hero movie of all time! It's got everything a great super hero film needs, great story, acting, pacing, action,hero, villain, love interest and a touch of comedy. Spider Man 2 also develops the character and answers all the questions the first film didn't fully flesh out. I thought Alfred Molina (a guy I had never heard of at the time) was absolutely fantastic as \\"Doc Ock\\" . The FX look better and the fight scenes are more appropriate for our web slinging hero with high flying air battles, Spidey shooting web balls and a villain who looks much more like his comic book counter part. Besides having great action sequences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie. The blend of drama and action would not be complete without a pinch of comedy which this film hits on every cylinder. Whether it's Spidey delivering pizza, taking an elevator ride or the hilarious use of the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' this film has some wonderful funny moments.<br /><br />Spider Man 3 - 4.2<br /><br />OK this one is for my Twin Andrew! I know this film has taken a beating and I would have to agree it is a disappointment. I really don't know how it couldn't be. It' just had too much to live up to. The biggest problem with this film for me is that Raimi didn't make it long enough. I think he knew this would be his last Spider Man film and he should have given this installment the length it needed to tie up all the loose ends from the first two films with the detail it deserved. I do think this is a very good film and only in the area of Venom does it seem rushed. I think Venom needed another 20-25 minutes of time in the film before joining forces with Sandman. this would have given this interesting character time to develop. Venom is a unique character in Web Heads Rogue Gallery and he deserved more than just an add on in this film. He's stronger than Spidey, he knows who Spidey is, he is immune to Spidey's Spider Sense. I think the possibilities are wasted here and I think the extra time would have made all the difference in the world. Considering all that is going on in the bloated finale, I do think Raimi does a good job of keeping things moving without becoming too confusing. I know there are many changes in the comic book history, but you have to expect that sort of thing when a comic book character makes a transition to film. I think Spider Man 3 is a very good film and a fitting end to the series even if a little too ambitious.<br /><br />So overall this is a good set, but for me I would rather have the DVD editions with all the interesting bonus material than better looking films with no bonus material. I will keep both the DVD and the Blu Ray versions. The choice is up to the consumer, but be aware that there is surely a better version around the corner.equences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie.

B002HEWN16|5.0|I like that the toe and two ankle straps are velcro adjustable and the sole is structurally significant.
B003HARV4S|2.0|The Illusionist is one of my favorite films. A unique magic/mystery/love story that is wonderfully written, perfectly cast and excellently directed and acted. The blu-ray is a solid improvement over the dvd, however, because the film was shot in a bit of a soft-focus way, it may not come across as razor-sharp as the newer blu-rays. Still, its well worth an upgrade from the dvd for such an excellent movie.<br /><br />My only criticism is with the rest of the blu-ray treatment. While the picture and sound are excellent, everything else is an embarrassment. There is no main menu, no chapter selection or bookmarks, and no special features on the blu-ray disc. Just a garish intro page telling the viewer that they can access the specifications by pressing the top-menu button. That gives you access only to the audio setting. And there are no subtitle options either. Madness! Subtitles actually would help occasionally on this particular film as sometimes the actors are speaking quietly and are difficult to hear, and what they are saying is important to the mystery of the film.<br /><br />This set includes the original dvd disc which DOES have a main menu with all the expected options, so the buyer gets a bizarre combination of a blu-ray disc with nothing but a hi-def picture, and a vastly inferior standard-def disc that treats the film with at least a little of the respect that it richly deserves.<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad to finally have a hi-def version of The Illusionist, but I'm baffled and frustrated that Fox treated it with such contempt.
044024367X|2.0|Jack Reacher is undoubtedly the illegitimate son of Dirty Harry Callahan.  In each and every Reacher novel that Lee Child has penned our hero, though a man of few words, presents a persona that literally screams \\"make my day\\".  In NOTHING TO LOSE the drama continues as this man of few words, and even fewer possessions, finds himself seeking to alleviate his hunger pangs by grabbing a quick meal at a local diner located in Despair, Colorado.  He is refused service, attacked by a \\"deputized\\" foursome, thrown in jail, appears before the local judge, is found guilty of vagrancy and told to leave town and never come back.  Well, as readers of Reacher novels know, you never ever give Reacher that sort of ultimatum.......it only piques his curiosity.<br /><br />After being unceremoniously ejected from Despair, Reacher finds himself in the adjacent town of Hope and with the sometimes unwilling assistance of the solitary town policewoman decides to investigate what is going on in the town of Despair that makes its inhabitants so adverse to welcoming outsiders?  The fact is that Despair is the repository for a multitude of \\"dirty little secrets\\" and Reacher possesses an almost inhuman amount of tenacity to challenge the powers that be and expose that which is being so zealously concealed.<br /><br />While not one of Lee Childs best Reacher outings, the audio version was adequate enough to keep me from nodding off on a 1000 mile drive. 2 1/2 stars
B0038QGXHW|5.0|I bought the CD after I incidentally heard an interview with the two musicians. Although famous pieces like the ones on Jarrett's  Cologne concert are more dramatic and tumultuous, the ones on this CD are beautiful in their own mellow, calming and understated way. Beautiful performance.

A definite buy for this one, I loved this movie as soon as I watched it at the movies. A great time for South Africa also because of the FIFA 2010 World Cup. A beautiful tourist destination also. Can wait until I visit that beautiful country, located nearly at the bottom of the world near the South Pole.
0385736002|4.0|I enjoyed the folklore and mythology.  I thought towards the end it moved a little slow and seemed to drag along while you were waiting for something to happen.  The leygate was a great way to change the story, end the book and crete a new saga elsewhere with new characters added.
1594744475|5.0|I initially bought this book for the \\"cute factor\\", to see what fun things people were able to put together with their lunches. I didn't expect that I would be using many of the recipes or creating my own bento right away. I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I was able to utilize both recipes and the cute food. A few days after receiving the book, my office did a potluck to celebrate the World Cup. To represent Japan, I did the Teriyaki Meatballs and re-created the soccer balls found in the sports bento. The teriyaki sauce was simple to make, using ingredients I already had in the pantry. The musubis definitely were a crowd favorite and I got lots of compliments. Little did everyone know that they took just a few minutes to make with the help of Yum Yum Bento.     I found that even though the foods in this book look impressive and seem to be time-consuming, they are simple enough for even the busiest person to use. A few extra minutes of prep gives food a flourish. The book does a great job of simplifying everything and making bento accessible to the masses. I can't wait for the next excuse to create something from Yum Yum Bento!

B001C4CI8U|5.0|I recognize this feeling. I've been here before - with 'X-Files,' with 'Battlestar Galactica,' with 'Firefly.' A television series that sets up high expectations with a bold concept, lots of potential, and an original storytelling voice. A show that teases and tantalizes and excites the imagination. Something that makes me think \\"This, now - this is something worth watching!\\"<br /><br />Make no mistake, the first season of 'Fringe' IS well worth watching. There is a lot of bang for your buck here. 20 full-length episodes on 7 discs, with lots of extras, including deleted scenes for most episodes and a fun gag reel.<br /><br />More importantly, 'Fringe' is excellent television, particularly if your tastes run to the edgier side of the spectrum. Starting off at a gallop, with an international flight that ends horrifically, the series poses idea after idea in the realm of 'fringe' science, where science meets the fantastic. Some of the ideas explored in the series include teleportation, time travel, telekinesis, mind control, pyrokinesis, and alternate dimensions. All are explored through investigations of strange events, seen through the eyes of FBI agent Olivia Dunham as she solves crimes associated with the events. Agent Dunham is joined by Peter Bishop and his father, whose most recent residence was an insane asylum. Dr. Walter Bishop has a unique understanding of and connection to these strange events, but his memory is spotty at best. Together they uncover the source of the events, and slowly, discern a pattern connecting them.<br /><br />For the most part, 'Fringe' is filled with solid talent. A product of J.J. Abrams' unique vision, who brought us 'Alias,' 'Lost,' and the recent reboot of 'Star Trek,' it shows all the originality and knack for drama he's shown us before. The writing is top-notch, and so far rides the fine line of keeping much in the dark, but answering enough questions to keep you interested. The acting is excellent overall. Though Anna Torv is an unfortunate weak spot - she overplays her role sometimes as the 'tough girl' - she does the job, and the others more than make up for it. A high point is John Noble's portrayal of Dr. Walter Bishop; he plays a pitch-perfect mad scientist with depth and sensitivity, lucid and clear in some moments, then suddenly offbeat and odd with no awkward transitions - you never feel like he's \\"acting.\\" It's also simply delightful to see Blair Brown in a substantive role again, though her appearances as the enigmatic Nina Sharp are too few and far between for my taste. A nice surprise awaits near the end of the series as well, for those who watch for it.<br /><br />All told, it makes for a exciting, strange and engaging story, full of suspense and unexpected twists and turns, with tons of potential. I felt this way about 'X-Files' in the beginning, but unfortunately that collapsed under its own weight by the end. The first season of the new 'Battlestar Galactica' made me feel this way too, almost lost its way halfway in, but managed to follow through on most of its promises in the end. I get the same sense from 'Firefly' every time I watch it, but that was sadly cancelled almost before it started.<br /><br />'Fringe' is off to a solid start.

030745455X|3.0|This book was very long! Sometimes it dragged on, and had too much detail. Towards the end though I couldn't put it down! I have never read a book where I didn't like any of the characters. They aren't very likeable. If you like romantic or \\"feel good\\" novels, this isn't your book!
1400052173|5.0|I could not put this book down. I have NO time to read and I could not stop opening this book whenever I had a spare minute. The story is so tragic but so important for us all to know. The book is well written and reads like a novel. I read the \\"one star\\" reviews and could not disagree more. The author clearly respects the subjects a great deal and devoted a good portion of her life to doing this research. I am so glad Mrs. Lacks is getting the recognition she deserves. Truly compelling read that brings up some fascinating bio-ethical issues.
030726999X|4.0|The book was a great read as the third book of the trilogy.  Reading this book out of order would definitely impact the reader's opinion.  There are brief periods where Stieg has pursued a dry/slow tangent and appears to jump to another time without notice, but overall is a great read.  There are clearly some lose ends at the conclusion that could be left as is, or pursued as a subsequent chapter in the Blomvkist/Salander/Berger/ and Figuerola saga.  Time and Lawyers will determine if we see another Steig Larson book.

B001R0KH3W|5.0|I saw portions of this concert on PBS and enjoyed it so much I went on line to Amazon and discovered it's available, thankfully, in Blu-Ray. (I say \\"thankfully\\" because they're not enough quality concerts on Blu-Ray yet, in my opinion.)<br /><br />Anyway here's the \\"skinny\\" on this Blu-Ray:<br /><br />1. The concert I think was fabulous. Stevie's been around so many decades that he can sing song after song of big hits. As a result many in the audience know the lyrics and \\"sing along\\". Stevie at times significantly encourages this: even letting the crowd sing the first stanza to a couple songs at least. I read the other reviewers' comments. I don't understand the criticism of hearing the crowd sing along. I mean, to my way of thinking, if you want pristine \\"sound\\" sans crowd then don't buy a \\"live album\\". Buy the CD or download the music. If I want to go to, see, a CONCERT, however, I want it to be a concert experience (sans, of course, the part about not seeing the stage due to everyone standing or arena view issues)! This means, I WANT to hear the crowd sing along at times. I want to hear the gaffs, coughs, the cheers, the applause!  I'd give this concert an A.<br /><br />2. The video quality is excellent, but not 1080p quality. It says 1080i, but to my way of thinking, more like 720. It even has a \\"film/grainy\\" look at times. Not bad, but this isn't anything like the quality of Planet Earth or Avatar. I'd give the video quality a C+, for Blu-Ray. If it were DVD, I'd rate it B+ or A-.<br /><br />3. The audio quality is in three choices: the Default seems to be LPCM 2.0, which is VERY GOOD. The other choices are Dolby 5.1 (not as good) and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. I've listened to all three. The LPCM manages to quieten the crowd and external noises quite a bit. This emphasizes Stevie and Band a bit at the expense of crowd. However the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 blows me away. I mean, I could really think I was \\"there\\". I hear things, including in the music, I just can't hear otherwise. You can \\"really\\" hear the crowd. I give this AUDIO an A.<br /><br />Conclusion: For ME, I think this Blu-Ray disc with the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 turned on is the BEST true to life concert experience I've yet had in my home. But I love concerts, loud music, music of all kinds, and I could easily see that many might think the somewhat subdued LPCM 2.0 default setting is better for them. With an A for Concert, C+ for Video, A for Audio, overall it's an A-.

0618918248|3.0|Considering some of the more antagonistic statements culled from the book by worshipers and critics, I anticipated a less thoughtful and rigorous work.  Instead, Dawkins, an Oxford University professor, provides a detailed, scientifically based, yet understandable (if you take the time), argument against the existence of God.  Improbability seems much less improbable, and more almost probable, based on the sheer number of estimated planets (a billion billion, according to Dawkins).  And a number of these planets (1billion he estimates), statistically, must fall within the Goldilocks zone that would provide the environment for life to form.    Unfortunately, he often juxtaposes his arguments for evolution against Intelligent Design -- and a Darwinism vs. Genesis battle is too one-sided to interest me.  Genesis is dead on arrival to any thinking person -- and what non-thinking person would be reading The God Delusion?  His contention that the soaring improbabilities of many evolutionary events only makes it more soaringly improbable of the existence of a Divine Being is disappointingly inane.    And while he attempts to provide a compelling explanation of evolution/natural selection, by doing so within the context of refuting intelligent design, he detracts from what could have been a more successful effort.  He fails to address, in any meaningful way, the leaps in the evolutionary process that seem, at least, immune from the standard progress by degrees explanation.  He dismisses the few he does address as a simple lack of current understanding while bemoaning those who attribute these leaps/gaps to God's handiwork.  But, evolution alone, while the obvious pathway of development, fails to adequately account for the innumerable chasms life forms have had to bridge to reach their current states of development.    Genetic variance of a single organism or animal is, by itself, insufficient to bring about genetic change in a species.  What is needed, according to the evolutionary theory, is for a multitude of organisms/animals to undergo the identical genetic mutation simultaneously.  Though I concede that genetic variance is an ongoing process, I find it difficult to accept that a spontaneous genetic mutation could \\"afflict\\" a multitude of offspring simultaneously (and, we know that most \\"spontaneous\\" mutations of multiple offspring are the product of environmental degradation that have undermined that species' overall health and, therefore, the quality of their DNA).     Though Dawkins makes a comprehensive argument against the existence of God, it is difficult to adopt his prescription of dismissing the breathtaking whole as the accumulation of trillions of minor and improbable genetic variations -- and while Dawkins provides many insights and well articulates his position, it is his explanations leave too many loose ends.    Someone noted that the opposite of the fervent theist is not the dogmatic atheist, but he who remains indifferent to our origin.  What drives someone like Dawkins to work so furiously at destroying the possibility/idea of God (this is not his only book on the subject).  Dawkins dislike for religion is on full display.  Religion, in all it's forms, needs to be scrutinized and, where necessary, discredited.  After all, religion is often nothing more than power structures built on lies and nonsense.  Though the pursuit of the truth is a worthwhile endeavor, there is a significant difference between exposing religion and stridently arguing against the existence of a Divine Being.  Belief in a Divine Being, untethered by religion, has caused none of the harm Dawkins rightfully attributes to religion.  In the end, certainty in this vague realm of inquiry is simply not to be had. No one can say for sure what, if anything, is behind this universe.  The phoniness and sheer absurdity of most religions has likely fueled some scientists, like Dawkins, to undertake the fool's errand of proving we occupy a Godless world.So, while The God Delusion is in many respects a compelling read, Dawkins forfeits valuable credibility by claiming to answer the unanswerable.

The minimalist thing can only go so far.. well they certainly hit the nail<br />on the head with this album. It's got a sort of nostalgic yet totally original feel. Every song keeps me<br />interested.. and there are a lot more songs on the CD than the sleeve suggests. I can't really categorize<br />the disc, it's sort of White Stripes meets Lenny Kravitz with the studio precision of NIN and all rolling around<br />in the bed of some '65 pick up truck down south.. or not. It's hard to tell it grabs me every time.

B001GKJ2DY|4.0|This DVD is a joy to watch.  Of course the music is great and there is the option for the sing-along words.  Pierce Brosnan can't sing (it's painful and the reason I give it 4 stars) but he is still good to look at.  Meryl Streep is amazing as usual.  This movie lifts my spirits.
B002NUULNG|3.0|I'm not the biggest Ghost in the Shell fan of all time or anything but I enjoy the story very much. I've had it on VHS, DVD & got it for a good price on blu-ray. Honestly I was pretty good with the DVD version I have but looking at the back of the case I read: ALL THE ORIGINAL ANIMATIONS ARE RE-PRODUCED WITH LATEST DIGITAL FILM AND ANIMATION TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING 3D-CGI.    you would think the whole movie has been redone in 3D-CGI, but no... it's only bits and pieces here and there and it makes it seem like a totally arbitrary choice. Thankfully they included the Original movie in the special features.
B001E75QH0|5.0|We absolutely love Harrison Ford and this collection is a must have. For the price, it is a steal.  Movie quality is great and I highly recommend this set.
030726999X|5.0|Great plot. Great characters. The writing is just okay but what the hell -- 5 stars!!!!! (and exclamation points)
030745455X|4.0|Read \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" on vacation.  Bought the other two books later.  The further adventures of the remarkable and wonderful Lisbeth are tied to the people and locations of \\"...Tattoo\\".  There are revelations and twists.  The end sets up the beginning of the third book in the series.  I suggest that it be handy when you're finished with this one.
0307346617|4.0|I initially had a bit of difficulty getting into this. It's not a novel with the traditional narrative. It is written more like the script of a documentary film made of the survivors of a zombie apocalypse; therefore it is a collection of short interviews with people from around the world of their experience. The stories are basically lined up chronologically, dealing with the earliest days of the initial outbreak up through the post war years. The interviewees vary from government officials, to soldiers, to ordinary people. The interviews vary in length and some of them are quite moving. However, you never really get a chance to get attached to any of the characters and interviews often end abruptly. There were many times I found myself wanting to know more about certain characters and what happened to them next.    I feel the book could stand to have a better ending, perhaps an epilogue by the interviewer summing up the current world situation. As it is, the last interview just ends and this time there isn't another one following it. Still, the writing is excellent and I found myself really drawn into the book to the point where it was nearly impossible to put down. Much of the book is somewhat depressing, but the characters are realistically portrayed and easy to visualize.     It is certainly a different take on the zombie tale and one well worth reading.
0743270754|5.0|This is a long read but well worth it for the amount of history it contains.  This isn't Lincoln gossip.  It's a look at  how Lincoln thought and worked.  I had been a Lincoln fan, but, after this book, I felt I understood his presidency and its burdens more thoroughly and admired him in a whole new way.

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Although she may seem like just another pop star looking for attention on the surface, if you look a bit deeper into the songs of Katy Perry, you'll find a clever songwriter and a true talent.    Perry first got a true taste of fame telling the story of when she got drunk and kissed a girl at a party on the album's second single, which went number one. She then ditched the predicted \\"one-hit wonder\\" status by cranking out a few more hits, such as \\"Hot N Cold\\" and \\"Waking Up in Vegas\\". While these tracks may make her seem like a \\"party girl\\", it was the album tracks that didn't get all the attention that make One of the Boys worth the time and effort.    The album starts of with the pop/rocker title track where she sings about becoming more feminine and not just being one of the boys. (\\"Over the summer something changed/I started reading Seventeen and shaving my legs\\") The track's chorus instantly grabs you, and it's just one of the many irresistible hooks on the album. \\"Ur So Gay\\" tells the story of a man Katy used to date who was very feminine, however it is mistaken by many as homophobic.    The album has it's fair share of ballads too. \\"Thinking of You\\" talks about missing your ex when you're with your current lover. \\"Lost\\" goes a bit deeper, taking on the emotional topic about being lost spiritually. (\\"So if i pray, am I just sending words into outer space?\\") Probably the album's best song lyrically is \\"I'm Still Breathing,\\" because although the lyrics are simple, they help define how blind love really is (\\"No formal education/I swore way too much/But I swore you didn't care/Because we were in love\\") and that when it's time to let go, you just need to let go.    The album concludes with \\"Fingerprints.\\" A spunky little pop-rock number, in which Miss Perry (or Mrs. Brand) tells us that she's going to make something of her life and not be \\"sitting on the sidelines watching it pass me by.\\" Indeed, Katy sure has come along way since she wrote those words. The lead single from her next album Teenage Dream, called California Gurls, went straight to number one, but only time will tell what the future holds for her. However, if One of the Boys is any indication, the future looks pretty good.
0618918248|2.0|First - sorry for the length, but I ain't the first.    I'm a thoughtful Christian.  My aptitude tests though school put me in the 98-99% of science and math and I aced the logic portion of my GREs.  I may not be a genius, but I'm someone who excels in logic.  I'm also an artist.   I read widely in  theological as well as, educational and philosophical, as well as scientific material. I have read the Bible in it's entirety (a number of times), along with apologetic materials such as \\"Evidence that Demands a Verdict,\\" and followed up Darwin's Black Box with reading Behe's critics.  This just to say I'm not blindly ignorant of either my faith or science.    I think I stayed away from Dawkins because in some way I feared him by reputation.  Dawkins was the nuclear weapon of atheism.  A man so intelligent and persuasive, he crushes Christians with his stare.  A Goliath (Dawkins says you all need to know your Bible if for no other reason than to understand all the allusions in the world) before which all quake.  Well, I finally steeled myself up to read this book and am left saying, \\"I don't even need these five smooth stones.\\"  The giant may not be defeated, but I can face him without needing to fear.    Before anything else, I have to acknowledge that this book is a masterpiece in persuasiveness.  It'a very adept at the soft-sell.  Dawkins almost imperceptibly tosses his collegial arm around you (who are obviously smart and enlightened and progressive and rich and good looking, just like all the atheists in the world today).  He disarms you with his witticisms and gets you laughing with him at all the stupid things people believe.  But, while accusing religion as the evil empire that pits \\"us\\" (believer) against \\"them\\" (non-believers) he has created a new \\"us\\" (the smart, peaceful, enlightened, progressive, open-minded, tolerant, good looking atheists) against \\"them\\" (the stupid, violent, ugly, closed-minded, bigoted, god-worshippers).  Substitute \\"white and black\\" for\\"atheist and theist\\" in a few phrases of this book as you read it and hear to how hateful he sounds.    But beyond this, I find his logic weak, his theological understanding paper thin and his view of humanity distorted. An example - he postulates that if laws were removed, people would all act just as orderly as they do now.  Do you really believe this?  He even gives evidence to the contrary (by way of a police strike in Canada), but tosses out that information.  Why?  Because it doesn't agree with his belief. How many of you would willingly advertise that ALL laws and the enforcement thereof would be removed from your town (or state or country) and we'll just trust our common morality?  Anyone want to be a test case for the rest of us?  Anyone?    Dawkins sites the worst in religious history (OK, he does mention that he is not going to mention the crusades or inquisition, which is itself a masterful rhetorical trick), but completely ignores all the good religious (and specifically Christian) organizations and people do.  What's the name of the hospital nearest you?  St. Mary's?  St. Jude's?  What are the best schools (from kindergarten to college)?  If you could afford a private (code for founded by a religious organization) would you go to public schools?  Who runs the soup kitchens and food banks?  Who do you hope responds to a disaster in your hometown?  National Geographic or the Red Cross?  OK, you get my point.  Dawkins hopes you won't remember those things - he doesn't even gloss over it.  Do scientists contribute to a better world in a more indirect way?  Certainly.  Not trying to say that, but are pharmasuedical companies giving away all their life giving drugs that science creates?  Hardly.  Where's the morality in that?  An atheist culture can only inherit the morality (and the structure and organization) that religious thought and organizations have built, but he won't even admit that little fact.    Don't get me all wrong - Dawkins has plenty that Iagree with.  Suicide bombers?  Making kids shudder with incessant talk about hell?   Yeah...people do terrible things in the name of religion, it is true.  But it does not follow that religion needs to be abolished.  (Which is what Dawkins is advocating here, do NOT water that down).   I could equally say that someone following Dawkins evolutionary, atheistic view of the world who kills someone to take all their things, justifying it by saying that 'the person is no different from a monkey (or a cow or a frog) and that if they were \\"more fit\\" they would have survived' means that we should abolish evolutionary, atheistic views.  And I'm not going to pretend to defend every religion's teaching.  For example, I think Mormonism flies in the face of reason as well as Dawkins does.    One scary, scary thing Dawkins seems to believe is that it should be OK for the state to take kids away from people who force their religious views on their children.  I am NOT making this up.  Read his section titled \\"In Defense Of Children.\\"  He's quoting NIcholas Humphreys, and admits it seems shocking, but continues on as if it's only logical.  Teaching your child a religion, that is obviously a lie, robs them of their ability to grow up innocently and embrace the wonder of science, and is paramount to abuse, so parents who try to force religion on their children need to be taken out of the picture.  I take this as his sincere view (he seems very passionate about the \\"protection\\" of children in this regard).  REALLY think about that.  A governmental organization that decides if parents are \\"indoctrinating\\" their children in a \\"false belief.\\"  This organization then takes the children away from the parents (to live where?) for their own good.  REALLY?  Perhaps we could just remove the parents long enough to \\"cleanse\\" them of these false beliefs?  This is the logical result of Dawkins' view.  It is what he is (if not advocating), dreaming of.  How long before someone tries to get it intoaction?  This alone should be a HUGE red flag that Dawkins is not just interested in scientific truth, he wants everyone to think like he does.    Which leads me to my fear of Dawkins' apparent view that if people would just LISTEN to him, they would be convinced, become atheists, accept evolution and BE HAPPY.  And those that don't agree with him?  They are obviously stupid or belligerent or brainwashed or something, because HE IS RIGHT!  Wow. I applaud his passion and fear his arrogance.  It is the stuff that dictators are made of - atheist dictators like Kim Jong Il, or rather, people who have set up a police state to enforce patriotism and \\"worship\\" of the leader and does not tolerant dissent, like belief in a God that challenges the leader.  Oh, yes I did.    The worst thing about Dawkins' book may be what he himself does not even believe - the consequences of an atheistic, evolutionary world view.  In short, I find him a very poor evolutionary atheist. He may be a pacifist, and proud of that, but that isn't a very evolutionary, atheistic attribute.   Isn't the basis of evolutionary atheism that people are not fundamentally different than animals?  That it is the strongest and best fit who survive?  Isn't it a short walk to people acting on eugenic-type ideas? Get rid of the Downs Syndrome kids.  (By the way, this is already happening in-utero.)  Get rid of the cripples, they are sucking our collective resources.  Get rid of the old people.  Right?  I'm not saying this is what DAWKINS would advocate, Dawkins has a nice set of morals, as I'm sure most atheists today do, but they are dishonest, because their own belief system carries no morality at all.  On what basis do you say, \\"don't steal\\"?  If it helps me survive, and I can get away with it (I am stronger, more intelligent, whatever), what is wrong with me stealing everything I can?  Why do you embrace monogamous marriage?  Stupid religion, that's why.  Sex in the natural world is mostly free-wheeling and the women raise the kids on their own and the men may bring some food, but mostly we just fight for propagation rights, so why should humans be any different?  While one could argue the MERITS of monogamy, in Dawkins' world view, you could not argue the MORALITY of it, and \\"deadbeat dads\\" could NOT be accused of not doing what is \\"right.\\"   On what basis do we not kill members of the gene pool that are keeping us from evolutionary advancement?  There is no moral basis (beyond what we arbitrarily agree is good) for any \\"right\\" or \\"wrong.\\"    But I digress.  None of my critiques of Dawkins are reasons to believe in God, but simply fears of listening to his call to arms.    Why do I believe in God?  Because I believe in the historicity of Jesus Christ.  In reading the Gospels (and the Acts of the Apostles, etc) I read something that is completely different than other ancient religious documents/ narratives. The Bible has specific people and places and actions and challenges the (original, at least) readers to go talk to these people who are still alive.  The gospels report it was a woman who first testified to the risen Jesus, this in a culture when women could not even give testimony in court.  Why make that up?  Who in first Century Middle East would be convinced by that?  I cannot fathom that these documents and the actions of the original believers were fabricated. (The apostles admit that they abandoned Jesus, that they thought he was coming back right away - why admit that?)  SOMETHING happened to make them state that Jesus of Nazareth, whom the Romans crucified at the request of the Jewish leaders was seen alive.  And Dawkins quick dismissal based on the \\"Jesus Seminar's\\" proclamations of what Jesus didn't say and a 4th Century document that contradicts the New Testament documents and the like is not convincing.  Do I think the BIble is literally true 100% start to finish?  No, there are things that are meant to be symbolic (John's Revelation is symbolic writing convention from the time period, and not simply \\"John on acid.\\") and things that may have been stated in ways that a 5th Century B.C. mind could understand them.  But the Bible does refer to the earth as a sphere centuries before science figured it out, and that \\"in the beginning\\" the waters were all in one place (hence the land in one place, hence plate tectonics?) long before scientists considered (and then mocked, and then finally accepted) the idea.  God is described as having \\"stretched out the heavens\\" - could this be a description of unfolding or stretching space in a way that we are only now beginning to perceive as possible?  Do I expect a died in the wool atheist to just take my word for it?  No, but it IS possible to be thoughtful and critical and smart (at the risk of being accused of arrogance) and find flaws in evolution and find rationality in faith.    I'm glad I read this book.  (I'm also glad it was in my local library so I didn't have to give Dawkins any more money.)  He did destroy one aspect of my beliefs.  Dawkins did convince me that he is not the giant I was lead to believe he was.
0307454541|1.0|Why is this book so popular? Parts were very slow moving, and the rest was very disturbing. I don't understand why a book about men who abuse, rape, and murder women is so popular. What is wrong with you people????
1400052173|5.0|As a medical laboratory technologist who worked in the field for 40 years, including 25 years at a large teaching university hospital, I cannot stress strongly enough that THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR ALL MEDICAL FIELD STUDENTS!     The medical world is full of discovery, cure, treatment, heartache but always there are opportunities to do things better. It is far too easy to slip into a world of routine where patients become 'names' or worse yet 'numbers' or are known by their diagnosis. How often do we in the medical world hear 'have you got the lab results back yet on 'my' bowel resection?' or 'heard about your new leukemia...bummer'.    ALL patients are people first; patients second. They are someone's mother, daughter, co-worker, friend, child. I used to look at a vial of blood sent to our lab to be tested and think, 'this is not just blood...it is the life fluid of someone's father...it could be MY father'. To not think this way would make me guilty of the robot-like attitude that many adopt and exhibit.    This book put a name, a face and a family to what I...no, what WE...only knew as 'HeLa' cells. These cells changed the face of medicine, research, treatment and medical ethics forever. Henrietta changed the face of medicine, research, treatment and medical ethics forever. She and her family deserve respect and recognition for their part. This book is a wake up call.    If you're a student entering medical school, nursing school or in the paramedical careers, do yourself, and all your patients for years to come, a real favour and read this book. You will never, ever refer to a tissue, vial of blood or Room #34 as 'your bowel resection' ever again. And you will be a much better medical professional for that.
B002ZG9828|1.0|Left for dead and resurrected by Indian magic, Jonah Hex ( Josh Brolin) is a disfigured bounty hunter who can communicate with corpses.  He accepts a charge from the US government to track down the man who murdered his family (John Malkovich), a Confederate general who plans to destroy the nation's capitol with a super-weapon.    I haven't seen a movie this bad in a long time.  Apparently, director Jimmy Heyward and screenwriters Neveldine & Taylor strung together a bunch of stupid ideas that they thought were cool, tacked on an overpowering and totally inappropriate soundtrack, and didn't worry too much about tying it all together with a cohesive story.  The supernatural aspects of the story provided glimpses of what could have made this movie more than just a dismal Western, but Hex's ability to communicate with the dead was treated as nothing more than a convenient plot point to get him where he needed to be for another dull shootout.  I've never read any of the comics, but I know the character has been around for a long time.  A quick look at the Wikipedia entry shows that this film bears little resemblance to the published origin story.  Looks like another case of Hollywood hacks thinking their own lame ideas are superior to their source material.
0061537969|5.0|'The Art of Racing in the Rain' is likely the sleeper hit of the year.     My husband picked it up after finishing his Clive Cussler and Warren Buffet books so this was quite a switch up for him. My daughter read it in two days...my sister-in-law in one sitting. This book belongs in all book clubs and on all bookshelves--to be shared.    All dogs get old and die but Enzo was wiser than most. He shared his wisdom with his master who needed his support during the most horrific time of his life. In return, Enzo had his support when he needed it most.    Our dogs are our four-legged psychiatrist couch and by all accounts, probably do more for mankind than any pill or hour long session with a shrink.    Read this book and you will laugh, cry, feel warm and fuzzy one minute and feel outraged the next. When was the last time a little skinny book did that to you? This book crosses the finish line in FIRST place.
B000AL730O|5.0|Guess I'm 5 years behind the times on this, but this album is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard.  The pop-show-tuney Paul isn't what you find here.  Think of some of the Beatles darker, melodic ballads, which I always thought was one of Paul's strong suits (I'll Follow the Sun, No Reply, I'm Down, etc.).  That's the mood of the album, but it's so much richer than just that.  It's candid, biting at times, and gives you quite another take on an artist that has been a bit underestimated over the years.  Get it!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I wouldn't consider myself a hip-hop/rap fan, but I must say this is one excellent cd. I haven't even finished it and it's still one of my favorite cd's, easily, and I have hundreds. A word of warning though, when you go buy the cd, (and yes you should go buy the cd right now and drop whatever you are doing) buy a set of speakers too because you're going to need them. It's so good you can't listen to it quietly, you have to crank it up as loud as it will go!!!!!!!!!
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Im giving both the movie and the edition 5 Stars.    I have loved the Terminator movies since I first saw them, so 5 stars for the movie is no surprise.  More interesting to me is the transfer quality of the movie itself.  I bought the original T2 on bluray when it came out and loved how it looked and sounded.  I bought this one for the extra features and extended edition.  I knew it was supposed to be remastered for audio and video, but honestly I wasnt expecting much, I mean bluray is bluray right?  Wow, I didnt know I could be so wrong.  Obviously I knew different movies could have different quality, but I was shocked at how much better this one was.  I just put it in to watch last night and I was blown away.  Usually I get pretty mad at a studio releasing a dozen versions of a movie over and over, but Im glad this one came out.  At $10.00 this is a must buy for any Terminator fan.
0812550706|5.0|I loved this book! My friends have been recommending it to me for years and I finally read it. I got hooked on the series and have read eight of the books so far. I actually liked Ender's Shadow a little better than Ender's Game, and First Meetings also stands out for me. I'm glad I finally read it and now I recommend it to my own friends who have even a remote interest in science fiction.
B00006I53S|4.0|This is the kit lens that came with my 50D.  At least half of the first 2,000 photos I took with this camera were with this lens.  Many reviews are listed here, so before buying I would recommend looking at a variety of these reviews to see if this is the right lens for your needs.  For me, the lens worked pretty darn good under most conditions, but it's by no means the best nor is it a perfect fit for every user.  Let me explain why.    The Canon 50D is my first digital SLR - I just migrated from a set of 3 film Minolta bodies with several high-end, mostly prime lenses.  I've never really liked the picture quality of point & shoot cameras, so the 50D + 28-135mm lens seemed like a good, affordable fit for me.  Since I do mostly weddings and portraits, I knew a good portrait lens was a must so at the same time I bought [[ASIN:B00007GQLU Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras]], another well-priced lens.    Within a week we were off for a month in Vietnam and Korea.  Been to both before but this time wanted to photograph a lot of memories.  The 28-135 is very lightweight and convenient (as is the EF 85mm), so weight or size were never an issue.  The Image Stabilization (IS) is nice to have.  The 28-135 body is plastic, so the feel is a little chinsy but the image quality wasn't bad.  But 'not bad' and 'outstanding' are not the same.    Keep in mind that the 28-135 has a variable aperture, ranging from f/3.5 to f/5.6.  If you're ever planning on advancing beyond the symbol icons on the mode dial, venturing into aperture-priority (Av), shutter-prioity (Tv), or other modes, then you're going to need a larger aperture, at least f/2.8 or faster. If you want to use zoom lenses, having a constant, fixed aperture is going to make your life easier and your photos look much better.    It quickly became evident that this lens is what it is.  It's an inexpensive kit lens.  Does it blow away point & shoots?  You bet!  Can it take beautiful shots?  Of course!  But my experience is that stellar shots are more of the exception than the rule with this lens.    Remember that a large part of successful photography is technique.  Just having a nice camera or expensive lens doesn't necessarily qualify you to work for National Geographic.  The flip side is, if you want pics that are going to knock 'em dead, you have to start with good equipment.  If you're going to stick with inexpensive lenses, you're going to have to work much harder (and take a lot more photos) to get the money shots.  With good technique and with the help of a few other factors (good composition, appropriate lighting, a tripod, a good model or a beautiful scene, the right weather, plain luck, etc.), it IS possible to get great shots.    However, for many people, sooner or later the day will come when you realize that this lens can't keep up with your skills or photographic needs.  For me it was about a week into vacation - about the point when I was familiar with my new camera, and I started to see the difference in the photos I was getting with this and the Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 lens.    For the price, the package is excellent.  This lens is one of the best values I have seen.  There are days when you just want an easy, lightweight, 'everyday' lens that won't break the bank and wont break your back, and you don't have to worry about the lens getting damaged.  For a lot of people, this lens will be a perfect fit for many reasons.  And I will say it again, you CAN get awesome photos with this lens.    But for more advanced users, this lens will quickly become the limiting factor, the weak link in the chain.  Go ahead and buy your camera with this kit lens, get acquainted, and have some fun.  But put some money aside for an eventual replacement.  Canon provides many options, depending on your specialty.  For telephoto zooms, Canon offers a handful of different 70-200mm lenses.  The  [[ASIN:B000053HH5 Canon EF 70-200mm f/4L USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras]] sells for under $600 and is the least expensive L-series lens available.  A little more expensive but a good high-end replacement for the 28-135 is [[ASIN:B00009R6WT Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras]] at around $1300.  For wide-angle enthusiasts, try [[ASIN:B000NP46K2 Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens]] or its cheaper cousin [[ASIN:B00009R6WO Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras]].    You can see the direction I'm going.  If you want to move beyond the amateur level and get more control of your images, if you want to use some of the robust features of your camera and get more compliments on your photos, you're either going to need one or more prime lenses, or you'll have to go the route of Canon L lenses.  Yes L lenses are expensive, but the color and crispness they bring to your photos is phenomenal.  I started with one, then added another.  And I still have my EF 85 f/1.8.  I've got the tools I need to take the quality photos I want.    As for the 28-135, I can't complain.  For the price, the value is phenomenal.  It's gotten me some beautiful shots.  It also left me with some slightly hazy shots at a wedding and more over-and under-exposed, off-color images than I care to remember.  That's why for me, it's love-hate.  But like most unsatisfying relationships, the time came when I had to move on.  Farewell 28-135.  Been nice knowin' ya.  Buh-bye.

1935814060|5.0|\\"Siddhartha tells the story of a young man on a quest for the meaning of life. Primarily, he becomes a Samana, fasting and living with no possesions. He experiences and explores several different teachings and lifestyles, learning and taking with him something from each way of life, eventually growing tired of his ways and then moving on. In this manner, Siddhartha learns many different arts, trades and philosophies, eventually finding enlightenment.<br />This was a very short book, and was definitly worth reading. Although the story of a young man from a wealthy family going out into the real world to seek the meaning of life is not exactly original,it is still worth reading. The philosophy which this book largely bases itself on is not to follow blindly or get caught up in insignificant matters, but to think for yourself, learn something about yourself from every one of your experiences and find the meaning of life in this manner. I would recommend this book to anyone, it is a short, simple read and many things can be gotten out of it.\\"

In Blu-ray this film looks amazing, the plot is a fun little fantasy that i really enjoy watching from time to time.  I'm not expecting Oscar-worthy performances, but its by no means \\"Gigli\\" caliber acting either.  Its just a fun movie with great cinematography.  Again, its worth 15 bucks, or look at it this way.  For the same price of this movie you can get your family dinner at a fast food restaurant.  I'd rather buy this movie.

B002ZG997M|5.0|I watched this movie twice in 2 days. Action packed, funny in spots, suprises where needed. Great flick

0679420266|5.0|This book has been analyzed to death already - we can say its existentialism or point numerous fingers towards the words of Nietzsche and other great philosophers, and we can even make arguments regarding the virtues of death. Yes, this book does all of those things, but the subtleties of this book warrant our appreciation nonetheless.<br /><br />This book paints a vivid portrait of extremes. At first, the simplistic so-called American language and writing style, the utter lack of imagery and emotion, not to mention Meursault's complete lack of sensitivity, put me off. Nevertheless, very shortly I came to realize that Merusault is not actually a mere character in a story; he is a mirror, reflecting back all humanity's apathy. Some might say that Meursault is a caricature, a device used to advance a philosophical argument, and while that might be true, I do not take issue when an author exaggerates a character to make a very deliberate point.<br /><br />Meursault got used to his life, got used to the mundane, got used to the day to day drudgery, so used to it that \\"the emptiness of a man's heart becomes an abyss threatening to swallow up society.\\" Meursault is the victim of indifference. Every pleasure in life is meaningless for him, worth less than nothing. And it's only after Meursault is imprisoned for murder and confronted with his own death that he sees all he has taken for granted. Not only does he see the great beauty in the world, he also sees humanity as the world's greatest ugliness. Meursault holds fast to this exposed truth; when confronted with his own impending execution in the end, his only wish is \\"that there be a large crowd of spectators [...] and that they greet me with cries of hate.\\" One wish, and that is to live one moment free from indifference.<br /><br />Many struggle through this work. Yes, it can be seen as painfully boring in the beginning, but as you read, the story changes pace, the language shifts, and the beauty of the words begins to bloom as the pages turn. Meursault's situation might seem unrealistic, absurd even, but given a longer look ... its truth is glaringly apparent and quite disturbing..

B001W6S0C6|5.0|I purchased the Batman Blu Ray book with digital copy recently and was quite angered to learn the digital copy had recently expired.  There was no literature on the front or back of the shrinkwrapped copy to indicate this... So when I opened the blu ray(Thus voiding the return) The slip of paper had indicated that the copy had expired.  I tried it on itunes anyway just in case and NO LUCK!  I was quite livid since I travel year round and watch so many movies on my macbook or ipod.  At any rate I contacted Warner Bros and am waiting to hear back.  The movie itself was awesome in Blu Ray.  The book included is kind of cool.  I actually love the whole Warner book editions of these blu rays.<br /><br />SO IF YOU BUY IT FOR THE DIGITAL COPY... BE WARNED ONCE MORE... IT HAS EXPIRED.  IT EXPIRED IN LATE MARCH.  I will post again when I hear back from Warner Bros.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|What a brilliant film! I finally got around to watching it last night and was mesmerized. How people here can give it one star is beyond me, I can see no legitimacy in any of their critisicms. Seriously, this is film-making at the cutting edge of what is out there today. Great effects (given obvious budget restraints), good (not always great) acting, topical subject matter and a thoroughly engaging storyline, not much more you can ask for really. I can only assume that those who marked it down so lowly either watched the wrong film or were expecting it to be a fantasy like Star Wars or something. See it!!!
B003405MF6|5.0|I've been a fan of Jeff Beck for years, and haven't bought any of his CDs for a while. When I heard his interview on NPR and some samples of this album, I knew I had to get it. The album was great the first time listening, and gets better each time I hear it. There is much to explore musically. The title says it all - a skillful blend of rich, soulful songs mixed with just enough Jeff Beck kickin' riffs. The Puccini song is worth the album just by itself. Wow. The vocal tunes are my least favorite, but the rest of the CD makes it well worth it.

B0012GN3AU|5.0|Alice seemed to disappear after the 1991 album Hey Stoopid, for a good few years, some even wondered if he would ever put another album out again. Finally around five years later, this came out and suprise everyone. It is much more mature, finely crafted than many of his albums, very complex, a well written and put together.   It is a kind of concept album based on the story of a young boy called Steven, who gets involved and atempted away with a strange dangerous man into a bizarre deadly theatre where all kinds of evil and hellish things want to keep him from returning to a good life.   So all of the songs have lyrics which tell part of the story. This might sound stupid or like it might distract from the music, but no, the songs are some of the most well written, catchy, memorable, rocking tunes Alice has ever made. This a very great album, deep and thought provoking while loud rocking and fun. It also has a graphic novel comic book of the same name which does tell the whole story of Steven and his spooky horror ride. Great album.
0307454541|4.0|Very brief summary (since this has been reviewed so many times) and review.<br /><br />The setting of this novel is Sweden and the timing is just a few years into the 21st century. The story features two wonderful characters - one of them is Carl Mikael Blomkvist, an honorable investigative journalist who is going to be imprisoned for three months for libel of a corrupt industrialist.  Blomkvist is given an offer he can't refuse - pretend to be doing a family biography of the venerable Vanger family, while in reality try to solve the apparent murder of one of its members, a young girl named Harriet Vanger back in the 1960s. In exchange, he would be given a large amount of money and proof of the industrialist's guilt. This offer is made by Henrik Vanger, now 82 years old who desperately wants to find out what happened to his niece Harriet before he dies.<br /><br />The other lead, and now one of my favorite characters of all-time, is Lisbeth Salander. She is seemingly anorexic (she's not), 4'11, tattooed, pierced, and fierce as all hell. She has had a brutal upbringing (we are only given bits and pieces of her past, although we know about her horrific present.) Lisbeth seems to have Aspergers Syndrome, which turns out to be a mixed bag. She has trouble understanding the emotions of normal people and cannot seem to get close to anyone - she see's the world in a different way. And this is where her condition turns out to be a plus - she can analyze data instinctively and instantly. She is an expert computer hacker, and investigator. She has a photographic memory to boot.<br /><br />This book has Mickael and Lisbeth teaming up with each other, at first through necessity and because of business reasons, and later because they develop a mutual bond - the only real human bond Lisbeth seems to have had. (Outside of visiting her mother in a nursing home - we are not sure about their relationship.)<br /><br />The mystery itself is so-so, and in fact I didn't buy it at all. If this book had stock mystery genre detectives and investigators it would not have been the success it is. What makes the book so good are these two characters, and the interplay between them, and by the time we finish we don't want the book to end because we don't want our relationship with these characters to end.<br /><br />The good news is that there are two more books in the series. I haven't read them yet, but look forward to getting to them.<br /><br />Recommended.nre detectives and investigators it would not have been the success it is.

B00004ZB9D|5.0|This a very good collection from a guy with many great albums, and many important, fantastic songs, tunes and riffs. Most of them thankfully are included here, or the biggest one at least anyway. A really good introduction to a very fine important singer/song writer. producer rock/pop star.
193413712X|2.0|Very predictable. The characters where underdeveloped. Thankfully it was a short book. I read this because it won the Pulitzer, and the reviews were favorable.  Using the Pulitzer as a barometer of literary excellence has left me disappointed more often than not.
B0000025GW|5.0|This album is actually one of Dylan's very best, most personal, important, brave, bold album he ever made. It must be over thirty years old, but is still very contemorary sounding, relevant and hugely enjoyable.   This was the first of his so called 'Christian trilogy' of albums, and of those it is the strongest, most successful.   All of the songs are just amazingly well written, deeply honest and thoughful and thought provoking lyrically.   A stunning folk/rock album to be hear by all who wanted to be inspired, uplifted and moved. Great.
B003BKF696|5.0|I simply can't get enough of this album!  Great, moody, indie rock.  A couple of cuts remind me of Beck, however, this group is not copying anyone.  They have a very unique & individual sound.  The baritone vocals of lead singer, Berringer, take you to another place.  Highly recommend for any record collection.
1449512569|5.0|Chesterton's slant on an idea is interesting since he said in his time people were not believing in sin so let's call it something else and look at it from that angle. I'm enchanted with his look at the history of the time even through it was very much written for the time and place, for instance it took me a few paragraphs to determine the meaning of \\"Hanwell\\". Does well for the mystery and delving deeper. Haven't completed the book as yet so I'll have to leave it at that.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|I really loved this series.  The information is interesting, the video is amazing; it's really wonderful.
B003C1QIO6|5.0|This is a great CD, of course, I have all of Jack Johnson's music.  It so soothing, I love listening to him at work.
B003T70B46|5.0|What if?  That's the ultimate question this album asks.  In the 80s AIDS ravaged an entire way of life.  Were they promiscuous?  No doubt.  But they were also some of our most creative people.  This album asks you, \\"What if AIDS didn't happen?\\"  What would society be like?  Would homosexuals have the rights they're fighting for now?  Whether they would have the rights or not, Jake Shears and company are here to tell us that the promiscuous lifestyle would have raged on.  And the rest of us say \\"BRING IT\\"!
B0000669JL|5.0|Bob Marley's music has touched the souls of thousands. Why is this? This is because Bob Marley writes music out of true love. When i listen to his music, I know Bob Marley did not do it for the fame or the money, he wrote these lyrics to make a change to the world, the world that contains so many faults that are blatantly screaming danger. It's a shame that only so few such as Bob Marley stood up for what he believed in. Don't get me wrong, I honestly believe there are thousands of those who are making a change in the world, but many people have to see of how many of those who just don't care. Bob Marley is one of those who has always cared, and his music simply leaves me speechless. Cheers to you Marley.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Eliminate anything with the word \\"Pixar\\" attached to it and how many films or TV shows manage to appeal to both 5 and 50 year olds without completely alienating one or the other?  Perfect?  No, but much closer to it than any of the prequel films.  Had the Jedi and clones been given this much character depth in Episodes I & 2, Episode 3 would have been a beautiful tragedy (well, until the horrible overacting kills the last 3rd - no way to recover from the Emperor and Darth Vader's unintentionally comic \\"Nooooooooooooo!\\").  When I caught Episode 3 on TV after having seen the first seasons of Clone Wars with my son, I found the clones' betrayal of the Jedi much more involving.    And really, there's not one line of dialogue that's any worse than fully half of the trite, obvious prequel dialogue.  If anything, at times it can be subtle enough to border on bland - they rarely dumb down the technical talk for the younger set.    Where I think the show is really underrated, and where the DVD really shows off, is in its production design.  There's not a cartoon on TV with this depth and detail.  The lighting and texture rendering is absolutely stunning.  Even watching it on SD cable I picked up on that, but (and I don't even have the blu-ray) the DVD on an HD set is really gorgeous.  The featurette docs (on EVERY episode, thank you) also reveal how much work goes into each episode, even while cluing you in to some of the production limitations (and how they combat them with creativity).  Especially amazing to pull off 22 episodes in the era of 13 episode cartoon seasons.    If you only made it as far as the Clone Wars movie, you're missing out.  I actually hated the movie and found it extremely dull, but find the series far superior.  Yes, the \\"claymation\\" style molding of the animation my take some getting used to, but if the sculpted hair puts you off, focus on the subtlety of facial features and expressions until you get used to it.
B001EBYMAI|4.0|Not sure about the biblical references but movie-wise, I like it. It was unpredictable which is good, there were twists and turns, the tension was there throughout the movie, nice special effects, so it's a good movie overall. I would watch it again if I could.
B002VPE1YS|3.0|This is not the most attractive case. In fact, I would go so far as to call it unattractive. The overall quilted material is stiff, and it takes some effort to yank the drawstring closed. It actually looks like an eyeglass case that someone made out of an old quilted coat.     Because it is a universal case, it might be difficult to obtain a decent fit. Case is too large for my pocket camera & cell phone. Too snug for a Garmin 285. Decent for a Garmin 295.

With the knowledge in this book you will quickly be doing graphical things on the PC - a lot faster than with any Microsoft development environment!    If your goal is to use a PC language to develop graphics and apps on a PC, but don't feel that you are a 'programmer', then this is the language and book for you. The book is approachable and the language is very clean. The result is after going through this book you will have the confidence to 'do things' on a PC that you didn't think you could do. Programming is within reach of 'non programmers' again.
B0025VLELQ|4.0|I haven't seen this movie since the 80's and was wondering how well it would not only turn out in HiDef, but if like many movies from my childhood, would feel lacking as an adult re-watching it. The video and audio quality was better than I expected after reading other reviews and was satisfied with the quality for what I paid. Obviously the special effects and story are straight from the 80s, but it was a fun movie to see again as an adult and would recommend it if you are looking for something like this to add to your collection...just don't expect your kids with the newer movies to see to appreciate it as much as we did originally at that age!
030726999X|5.0|This is the third, and final, book in a sequence of three by Stieg Larsson.  All three have reached the top of the Best Seller lists and it is no wonder!  These books are really hard to put down.  Lisbeth, by virtue of her birth, has been declared an 'enemy of the state' of Sweden who must be silenced (one way or another).  This last book in the series is the culmination of her continuing fight, since childhood, against her unseen enemies and now finds herself critically injured and confined to a hospital.  Her relentless friends are pulling out all of the stops in trying to save her life.
B001NLKT60|5.0|A fast paced page turner that kept me hooked for weeks. This is the first book I bought on my kindle and am quite pleased with the product as well.<br />I will buying the Dragon that other reviewers rave about soon!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|What can one say about a vocalist who is a commbination of Billie Holiday, Miss Peggy Lee and Patsy Cline, other than WOW.  She can sing it all while piercing you with haunting, deep, and honest emotions.  All trax are great, but no. 2 and no. 10 will have you tapping and deep-thinking, respectively.  Bravo.  This is more than Jazz, it's life itself.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|This was a fast-paced thriller with a surprisingly satisfying ending.  It was also the story about the goodness in one's self.
030726999X|5.0|Stieg Larsson gave us a wonderful trilogy, then he passed away.  So sad.  The trilogy of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO and THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE and this book, THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST is brilliant. (read them in order, a must) This last part of the story is an eye opener and I admit I first thought, how can Lisbeth Salander make it against all odds, but it happens.  I feel that the character, Salander is one of the best female characters ever.  Look at the reviews for all three book, this set gets rave reviews. Read Stieg Larsson,get by all the Swedish quirks, and enjoy.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
142313494X|3.0|We listened to the audio CD version of this book while on a recent road trip.  The similarities to the Harry Potter series are too numerous and blatant to be ignored.  Like Harry, Percy is a 11-12 year old who has no inkling of his magical parentage.  Like Harry, he is/has been observed and watched over by disguised magical beings throughout his childhood.  Once he becomes aware of his magical parentage and potential powers he finds his way to the magical/mythical summer camp (Hogwarts) that exists solely to train-up \\"godlings\\" (young wizards) like himself.  At the camp he becomes friends with Annabeth, the daughter of Athena who is wise, smart and ingenious (Hermione).  His other friend is Grover, a humorous, accident prone, underachieving (Ron Weasley) young satyr.  The residents at the camp are divided into houses based on their Godly heritage (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin).  Percy/Harry and his young friends embark on a quest to the underworld (the Chamber of Secrets) to retrieve Zeus' lightning bolt (sorcerer's stone). While the story is enjoyable, we couldn't fully enjoy it for itself because we were so busy comparing it the ingenious Potter series.
B001TH16DS|3.0|I waited several weeks to order the first season Blu-ray until Amazon decided the reports of problems with the audio were corrected.  Well, the visuals are amazing, the enhanced special effects are all other reviewers have said and the audio is beautiful EXCEPT for the volume levels, those are beyond annoying.  I have to run my levels down to 22 on my receiver when in the menu screen and then up to 54 to hear the program.  This compares to my normal setting of 30 to 33 for music, FM radio, other Blu-ray's and DVD's and over the air network TV (excluding commercials on ABC but that is another story).  As much as I enjoyed watching the first season and as much as I would like to have the whole set I'm going to pass on purchasing them.
030726999X|5.0|Look. you're either going to buy this book or not.  My review isn't going to make much of a difference, is it?  If I have the power to sway you that much when hundreds of others have already written their review, and the book has been featured on the cover of Entertainment Weekly, I'll be shocked.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that everyone who has read my copy of 'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest' has loved it!  That number is currently three, and it promises to keep growing.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|After a wait of ten years for this movie, you will NOT be disappointed! Conner and Murphy are back with a vengeance and aren't stopping for air! Slight warning though, if you only loved the first movie for Smecker, at least give this one a chance, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the end!    Long Live the brothers, this movie was action packed, with comedy that would be frowned upon by the politically correct crowd, and don't forget the load of f-bombs that Boondocks is known for!!
B003B02OOG|5.0|I am a reader.  I adopted South Mississippi as my home nearly forty years ago but I work overseas for long periods of time and treasure my Kindel as my primary link to the English language.  Most of the stories in this book read like a letter from home.  I know most of these people well, or folks just like them.  I only wish that this particular book was much longer.  I read most of Grisham's early novels but after 4-5 I tired of the legal topics.  This novel was a refreshing change and I will probably go back and read the \\"in-betweeners\\".....
B0037QGS0A|4.0|From the buzz of this movie it made me want to check it out- and I'm glad I did. Julianne Moore is fantastic in this movie- along with Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried. A twisted tale but predictible the same- still great to at least see once.
030745455X|5.0|I enjoyed this second book in Larsson's series even more than the first.  Even though she is so different from me, I can really put myself in the shoes of the main character.  My only bit of advice is to keep a small page for a bookmark where you can make notes of who is who, as the Swedish names can be a bit confusing.  I had a really hard time putting this book down and I'm in the middle of the third and final book now.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|All I can really say is that this album is brilliant.  It's an extremely original piece of work, a very great balance of hip hop and reggae, but way more than just a blend of the two genres.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Season Three of Dexter was like an Encore to an Encore.  The first two seasons were fantastic, but I think this season topped them.  Whatever genius casting director came up with Jimmy Smits should be given a hefty bonus, because he was a revelation as Miguel Prado.  Honestly, I could not take my eyes off of him, he was riviting.  Smits really got the Latin vibe of his character and it was fascinating to watch him spar with the button down calculating Hall.  The actor that plays Hall's sister just gets better and better, she seems so real.  Geez, and poor La Guerta, she really has had a tough two seasons, one hopes next season she's given a break before she has a break down!!  Really, all the supporting actors are top notch, I can't give the casting director enough credit for putting together this great cast or the writer for continuing to come up with great story lines every year.  I loved that Dexter's Dad showed up in Dexter's minds eye. Im not sure if his vignettes with Dexter are not the best thing about the show.  Great season!!
1594744475|5.0|As a public school teacher, it's easy to see how kids are not at all enthused about eating their meals, or being picky about veggies.  You would too, if you were faced with bland, colorless, unappetizing fare on a daily basis (no offense meant to our hardworking cafeteria staff, I'm perfectly aware it's hard to cook for hundreds of kids with different tastes on a certain budget everyday!).  However, if their parents used a resource book like this to create nutritious meals for them, chances are very high that these aforementioned problems will go away.  Love is in the making, and there's hard evidence to eat!  Yum!<br /><br />As an Asian, it seems to me that bento is one of the super kid-friendly meals we have.  I remember growing up using bento boxes as baon and eating every single grain of rice!  Too bad the characters - if there were any - weren't as cute as the ones in this book, but at least I'll have ideas for my kids.  It's so easy, we can make these when my students have a lesson that involves cooking & nutrition!  They actually had a taste of it when we had a hanami by the Tidal Basin this past Cherry Blossom Festival - and even those that professed a dislike for veggies ate the cucumber pickles!<br /><br />This book allows people who are first-time bento makers to have an idea of how easy it can be to make, given easy-to-follow instructions and colorful graphics that enable one to see the finished product.  The only problem is, having to give it away before you eat all of the kawaii food you just made.<br /><br />There aren't too many English bento books that are this clear and \\"idiot\\"-proof.  It even gives you a time frame so you can work it into your busy schedule.  Try it, you'll like it!<br /><br />Below is my comment for Ms. Negative Reviewer, in case you don't get to read it.  To think that the authors she mentioned are close friends of Maki-sensei and even recommend this book - why would they do that if they were copied, right?<br /><br />* I would think that kyaraben &  oekakiben aren't copyrighted - even those authors mentioned by Ms.  Negative Reviewer may not even have had the most original designs - and if a book is useful and allows English speakers to access making kawaii bento better, it should have a place on any bento fan's bookshelf.  Now that I've read this review and comments, I'm buying this book (good thing the store is within walking distance) as well as recommend it to others, so no fear, Maki-sensei! &lt;3<br />d(^3^)bcopyrighted - even those authors mentioned by Ms.  Negative Reviewer may not even have had the most original designs - and if a book is useful and allows English speakers to access making kawaii bento better, it should have a place on any bento fan's bookshelf.

B002VPE1XY|5.0|This is a great small case for a small camera.  It fits my [[ASIN:B000NK6J6Q Canon PowerShot SD750 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver)]] perfectly.  That camera measures 3.6 x 2.2 x 0.8 inches.  The case is a very soft plush leather - which provides lots of cushioning if you are afraid of your camera getting knocked around.  There is a magnetic closure and a hole on top to let you stick the wrist band through.  There is also a belt loop on the back that closes with velcro, so you can easily attach it to your belt.  I actually use the belt loop attachment to attach this to the strap of my larger [[ASIN:B0016JA37Y Lowepro Nova 180 AW Camera Bag (Black)]]- since I like to be able to take all of my camera equipment with me together.  The silver latch tastefully shows the Amazon Basics logo.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great case if you have a camera that will fit.  Be sure to check the dimensions, there is not much stretch in the case itself.
0312330537|5.0|A book is only as good as what the reader takes from it. I read this during a confusing period in my life, and had to stop about halfway through. I stopped because I felt so close to the characters, so close to the raw emotion in the book, that when the protagonist does something I didn't like, I had to literally put the book down, and walk away for a few months. I would be the first to admit I didn't know a whole lot about a whole lot when I first started reading this. I still don't, really. But if you have the patience for this, you need to read it. During, and especially after finishing Shantaram, I felt like you could read this book, and contained within it are the keys to living a good life, a morally upstanding life. Since finishing this three years ago, I have changed quite a bit. What I felt back then, I don't feel now. The hope for a better future, the hope that people will not let you down, a general optimism. Those things are dead to me now, and so I will never read Shantaram again.<br /><br />And this is the reason for my title, because I think if I went back and read this, I wouldn't be able to make it through. I'd find it slow, boring, heavy-handed and too poetic. Where back then I found the text beautiful, everything seemed fresh, I smelled what Lin smelled, and felt what he felt. I don't disagree with the one-star reviews here, or the five-star reviews. Books are highly subjective, and while there are some criteria that a book can be objectively graded against, I don't think the fault lies with Gregory Roberts' writing skill. This was an amazing novel when I read it. In my head it might never be replaced by another favorite. But for that reason, I can never re-read it, because in the words of Nelson Mandela: \\"There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered.\\"
B0038YWPZS|5.0|great movie. I cry every time I watch it so sad for us all losing Patrick
B00129JSMY|4.0|I love Kiss Kiss Bang Bang!!! I think Robert Downey Jr is brilliant in it! But. I would have liked to know that the version they were sending me was the Canadian release. The movie itself isn't any different, so I'm not upset. It would have been nice to know, because I was unsure of that fact before I opened the packaging, because there is French on the cover as well.    That is all. Otherwise, very good.
B00068C7WA|5.0|Fabulous!  What else can be said?  If you love his music you will love this!  Saw Billy in concert and had to get it!  Enjoy!

B003L16FAE|5.0|Has it really been that long since the first PREDATOR movie was released? You might not think so but when you check the date you'll realize the film was released in 1987, over 23 years ago. More amazing is that when watching it, you don't feel the film is dated in the least with the exception of its stars looking a bit older these days.<br /><br />For those who don't know the premise here you go. An elite team of commandos is brought in by the CIA to rescue a diplomat held captive by rebels in a Central American country. The head CIA op in charge is Dillon (Carl Weathers) who has a good history with the team's leader, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger). With the situation described, Dillon insists on going along and the team head out via helicopter.<br /><br />As they trek through the jungle to their location, the team comes across a deadly sight. The bodies of three men hanging from the trees, their skin removed. A quick look and they find the dog tags of the group, its leader an old friend of Dutch's. This was the first team sent in for the rescue and one they hadn't been informed of. Thus begins a layer of distrust between the team and Dillon.<br /><br />The team finds the camp where the rebels are holed up and witness the killing of one of the hostages. With no time to lose, they formulate a plan and hit the camp with everything they've got, sparing no one and attempting to rescue the last hostage. Instead they discover him dead as well as the real reason for this mission. The Russians had sent advisors in to help the rebels and the CIA was trying to put a stop to their plans as well as retrieve information on hand.<br /><br />As they get ready to leave, they find one person alive, a young woman they take captive. Their attack alerted the rest of the rebel army and their site is now a hot zone. To be lifted out they need to get to a safe zone and taken out. But that safe zone is miles away through the jungle.<br /><br />As they team make their way through the jungle, lead scout Billy (Sonny Landham) senses something isn't right, that someone is watching them. Little does he know how true this is when all hell breaks lose and the team find themselves under attack. As the film progresses, we discover that the team is systematically being tracked and hunted by an alien, a predator, who views them not as living beings but as game. And the team must rely on everything they know to get out alive.<br /><br />Okay, so most of you already know the story or what happens. But for those that don't, don't give it away. Instead let them see the story of the Predator as it was meant to be and not the lackluster way it's been presented in sequels.<br /><br />So what makes this movie so special now? The film is just being released in a special blu-ray edition and claims to be the ultimate edition. And it seems as if it lives to its claim. There are all sorts of extras from voice over commentaries to making of featurettes. But that's not what makes the DVD special.<br /><br />What makes it special is the pristine look that the blu-ray quality gives to it. Even after all these years, the quality of the movie is crisp and clear as if you'd never seen it before. This is a movie that you could put into your blu-ray player and demonstrate to your friends just what the difference in quality is.<br /><br />But it offers something else as well. As I said at the start the movie holds up amazingly well. It doesn't seem dated in the least. You watch some movies and the clothing screams 70s or the hairstyles scream 80s. None of that is on display here so they don't date the film.<br /><br />But it's the quality of the movie that shows how well it holds up. It looks like it was fresh out of the can yesterday. Even the effects don't seem dated. And the make up effects by Stan Winston on the Predator itself still remain some of the best ever conceived and executed.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of movies released on both standard and blu-ray format and wondered why anyone would want to pay the extra for the blu-ray edition. Many just don't warrant the extra costs involved. But this movie, this edition, is well worth the extra expense.the extra costs involved. But this movie, this edition, is well worth the extra expense.
0316098337|4.0|I really enjoyed Emma Donoghue's Slammerkin and Life Mask, so when I heard that she had a new book coming out, I grabbed at the chance to read it, even though it's a very different premise than her historical fiction.  Room is narrated by Jack, a 5-year-old who lives with his mother in a shack, where they are kept imprisoned by Jack's father.  Jack's mother was kidnapped seven years ago, and all of Jack's life he's been in an 11-ft square room.  It's all he's ever known.  But one day his mother comes up with an escape plan, and she and Jack finally get to leave Room.  But living in the big world outside is difficult, with so much noise, so many people, and tons of space.  Jack and his mother have difficulty adjusting to life outside the room, and a life that involves so many other people and things than just each other.    It is odd to say that this book bothered me in all the right ways.  But it did.  I was uncomfortable almost the entire way through.  Kidnapping and rape are two of those topics that your mind tries very hard to slip away from, almost never even letting you contemplate the course either one can lead down.  This whole book, though, is about those two things, and as you read it, your mind is forced to confront those issues it tries so hard to avoid.    It isn't that this book is graphic.  As it's told from Jack's point of view, we don't hear about the emotional trauma his mother must have felt.  We don't get many details about the actual kidnapping or the imprisonment.  We just get a 5-year-old's sense of bewilderment as he discovers a world much larger than he expected, and his difficulty in accepting that his mother isn't just his any more.  In a way, this is even harder to take.  I don't know many 5-year-olds, but I think Jack was very authentic and true to form.  Sometimes, he was a complete sweetheart and sometimes, he was extremely aggravating.    This is an emotionally-charged, high-impact book.  Be ready for that when you start it!  It will terrify you and disturb you, but it will also draw you into Jack's world completely.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|New on DVD this week is PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF. Long title but what would you expect since the books it's based on has the same? Having never read the book written for the teen crowd and having no expectations for the movie, I went it not knowing for sure what to expect. For me that turned out great as I came across a highly enjoyable movie.<br /><br />The movie opens with a meeting between Zeus (Sean Bean) and Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) atop the Empire State building. It seems someone has stolen Zeus' lightning bolt and he believes it was Poseidon's son. He now gives Poseidon 10 days for the bolt to be returned or war will break out between the gods.<br /><br />Off we move to Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman). Percy is your typical high school nobody. With best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) he wanders aimlessly through school dealing with bullies and dyslexia. But on a trip to a local museum's display of Greek mythology the Greek words read clearly to Percy. When a substitute teacher takes Percy off for a discussion, she turns into a scaly winged Fury and attacks him, asking where the bolt is. To his rescue come Grover and teacher Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan). Once the Fury is gone, they tell Percy he needs to learn the truth and head to a place of safety.<br /><br />With his mother and Grover along, Percy discovers who he truly is. It seems that Percy's father was Poseidon, making Percy a demi-god or half human/half god. The place of safety is a camp for those like him in training but before he gets into the camp, his mother is captured by Hades and taken to the depths of hell.<br /><br />Once inside the camp Grover reveals his true form, a satyr or half man half goat. Mr. Brunner also reveals himself as Chiron, a centaur who trains those in the camp. Discussing the problems at hand, Chiron begins training Percy. During the training, Percy takes an interest in Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), the daughter of Athene and makes friends with Luke (Jake Abel) the son of Hermes.<br /><br />Tested in battle, Percy learns of powers he has that derive from water. Knowing that he must go to Olympus to tell Zeus of his innocence, he first decides to rescue his mother from Hades. Joining him in his quest are both Grover and Annabeth. To find the gate to hell, they ask Luke whose father was the only person to ever enter and escape unharmed. Luke provides them with a few items including a map that will reveal the entrance. All they need is to retrieve 3 pearls that will not only provide them the means of escape but illuminate the hidden locations on a map he provides.<br /><br />The majority of the movie involves the journey these three take across the U.S. to find the clues to the gate as well as retrieve the pearls. These journeys bring them into contact with everything from a fire breathing Hydra to Medusa (Uma Thurman). Each of them develops not only individuals learning about themselves as they move forward, but as characters in the story as well.<br /><br />Of course the journey doesn't always take them where they want nor are the results of the journey as they expect. But they do move forward, become heroes in their own right and finally have their confrontation with both the real lightning thief as well as the court of gods on Mount Olympus.<br /><br />The most obvious attraction to this movie is the special effects and those in charge here have done a tremendous job. But one would expect no less from director Chris Columbus who brought us HOME ALONE and two of the Harry Potter films. Under his direction the film flows smoothly and you never once feel the need to check the clock to see how much more there is. You're left, instead, wanting more.<br /><br />The young casts does a great job in each of their roles and the old pros do a fine job as well never hogging the stage from these upstarts. It would have been easy to do too, but instead they remain pros and allow the story to take center stage as well as these youngsters.<br /><br />When released in theaters this film didn't do nearly as expected which is sad. One can only hope that they continue to film the other books in the series. Not only did it provide a nice family film that could be enjoyed, it also might serve to interests young people into looking deeper into the myths of ancient Greece which would possibly lead to more interest in learning. One can only hope.<br /><br />While critics have felt the need to slam this film and call out what they think are shortcomings, I'd advise to give this one a look. You'll be entertained, have fun and perhaps remember those lessons learned years ago. And for young viewers, you'll perhaps pique an interest that you didn't realize you already had.early as expected which is sad.

B003JR1JV0|5.0|Despite the rather poor reviews I read from the \\"professional\\" music critics, whether newspaper or television-based, this CD is anything but a failure in the eyes of this Miley Cyrus fan.  Reading the reviews before this album came out left me with a rather negative and concerned vibe upon first sticking this disc in my CD player, but after a single listen I was rather pleased.  After a dozen, two dozen, three dozen listens, I felt it would be appropriate to smack the critics aside the head with a frying pan to knock some sense into them, because this album is a strong release, whether or not it follows Miley's Hannah Montana-like pop formula people have come to expect from her.    And that's exactly the thing with this release: it's not Hannah Montana and it's not the music we heard on \\"Breakout.\\"  But it's not, as many people have said, Britney Spears, or any other pop star we've come across.  It's still Miley Cyrus.  Every song on the album was written, at least in part, by her, and the lyrics do have meaning.  While many people see the image on the front cover of the album (or the more eye-catching image on the front of her \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" single) and make a snap judgment from it, I don't really feel the cover art is appropriate for what lies within the jewel case.  I've heard the word \\"raunchy\\" thrown around, but the music is anything but that.  I think for the most part this release is fit for many of the children who idolize Miley as Hannah Montana.  The album's book has three photos of Miley, beautiful but not really inappropriate to any extent.  Parents can check it out and give the disc a listen themselves first though.    There is an even mix of pop and dance beats as well as the ballads in which Miley shows off her true talent.  Rock Mafia-produced \\"Who Owns My Heart\\" and \\"Can't Be Tamed,\\" although both still great songs, seem to be obvious radio singles and little more than that; \\"Liberty Walk\\" could possibly be included in this category.  For Cyrus, Ifeel they're weak songs, both creatively and lyrically, and the fact that such songs will likely be among the few that non-Miley fans will hear off this disc, this becomes a sad fact.  Miley is facing some criticism for her use of auto-tune, especially in the aforementioned songs, but makes it clear in the other songs that this is only for creative purposes and that without a doubt she could go without auto-tune.  The cover of Poison's \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" is quite decent, although obviously unoriginal.  \\"Two More Lonely People\\" reminds me a great deal of some rather inescapable past Hannah Montana material and the ballads \\"Forgiveness and Love\\" and \\"Stay\\" are top-notch and beautiful, both with a pop country feel.  Of all twelve songs, in my own personal opinion, \\"Permanent December\\" and \\"Take Me Along\\" are by far the best songs on this album, followed by \\"Robot.\\"  Listening from start to finish, it's a great album.    The DVD in the Deluxe Edition includes a great mix of 17 minutes of time with Miley off-stage as well as the performance of the full set list of the Wonder World Tour as performed the week before Christmas 2009 for an attendance-record crowd at the O2 in London.  The total running time is 100 minutes.    This DVD is a must-have for any Miley Cyrus fan (or even any Hannah Montana fan).  It is professionally produced, most obviously live without lip-synching, and enjoyable throughout with plenty of nice added extras.  This concert DVD could have easily been released as a stand-alone product to bring in far more revenue, so the addition of this DVD to the \\"Can't Be Tamed\\" album for mere dollars extra is an awesome plus.    Having been a loyal, although not obsessive, Miley fan for some years, watching this DVD cemented her in my mind as a truly fabulous performer able to perform country, pop, and rock effortlessly with raw talent where many others stand undeservingly on stage.  She has absolutely amazed me and won me over with this.    This concert is full of energy, numerous wardrobe changes, a few nice ballad moments, and a few seriously impressive screams.    A detailed look at the \\"Live at the O2\\" DVD:    * The menu allows you to jump directly to individual songs but does not give an option to jump directly to the extra segments between songs.

0205313426|1.0|The authors violate their own rules.  Furthermore, E. B. White flunked out of grammar.  Is this some kind of joke?  Yet, the book is a best seller.  You won't learn anything from this rag.  I think it noteworthy that Shakespeare's surrealistic use of language would have been castigated by Strunk and White.  Several renowned authors, including C. S. Lewis and A. A. Milne, wrote that linguistic prescriptivism and hypercorrection were not practiced by one great writer in English to date.  Uninformed idiots with the opinion of Genghis Khan are pigeonholing succeeding generations of writers based on the publishing house's ability to sell books.
0307474712|3.0|I too had read rave reviews for this book, and I readily admit that the premise is exceedingly clever and involving.  I am roughly the age of the characters, and it was definitely fun to stroll through the past twenty or so years as covered in the novel.    Unfortunately, I found the male protagonist to be exceedingly unlikeable.  I do realize that the whole premise of the novel is to show the growth and change in these two characters, but even so, Dexter really spent the vast majority of the novel as a self-involved, hedonistic, childish alcoholic.  I kept waiting for the tipping point when he was finally going to enroll himself in AA and make a complete turn around, but it never happened.  The scene when he drugged his own daughter was beyond the pale.      Frankly, it never struck me as believable that this man would turn out to be the love of Em's life.  A school girl/university crush?  Sure!  But by the time she is a successful, level-headed woman in her late 30's, I can't imagine what she saw in him other than nostalgia and the memories of unrequited love.

B003L16FAE|2.0|I love PREDATOR, and I've seen the film countless times on various formats. I never got the chance to see it theatrically, but that doesn't matter, because even I know what a theatrical film is supposed to look like. Plain and simple, there is supposed to be film grain, that light, textured, almost alive element that makes a film look like a film. Scientifically, it is photon (light) charged particles of silver halides, but visually, film grain creates that subconsciously pleasing visual feel that you get from watching it, the way that you can tell, even on TV, that you are watching a film. DVD was able to capture some of that experience and bring it into your home, but now we have the Blu-ray Disc format, which when used to its full potential, can deliver an experience much better than that of DVD, and much closer to that of the movie theater. Unfortunately, this new 2010 release has a glaring problem that does not allow for that experience.    Fox first brought out a Blu-ray edition of PREDATOR in 2008, [[ASIN:B0012GVKW8 Predator [Blu-ray]]] which does not provide the best presentation possible on that format. The movie was released on a single-layered (25 GB) Blu-ray Disc, using outdated video compression methods (like the MPEG-2 video codec), and this first Blu-ray release arrived without any of the abundant extra features that were available on the 2-disc [[ASIN:B000244EMO Predator (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]] DVD released in 2004. Nonetheless, the film's grain structure remained relatively intact, even if the print used was in need of some proper restoration. For two years, fans had to live with this mediocre, but largely faithful Blu-ray release.    Fast forward to 2010, and now, with Robert Rodriguez's new film, PREDATORS out in a few days, 20th Century Fox has released this new version, on a dual-layered (50 GB) Blu-ray Disc  and packed full of extra features. It sounds like any PREDATOR fan's dream come true, but unfortunately, even though the film looks brighter and cleaner, Fox have unapologetically \\"scrubbed\\" the picture of its original film grain using a process called \\"Digital Noise Reduction\\" (DNR). This has produced picture quality that looks like PREDATOR was shot on video, the way that say, a game show, or the TV news looks. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger's face lacks any texture, and instead, he looks like a plastic Ken doll. The muscles of the actors look like globs of ice cream melted together, somehow managing to stay solid. In one scene, skinned victims of the Predator hanging from the treetops look like giant strawberry fruit roll-ups, and in another, a cascading waterfall looks as though it was painted into the movie--you can barely tell it is water.     The two stars are for the extras and the audio. The 2004 DVD extras have now been rightly ported over to the Blu-ray edition, as they should have been for the 2008 Blu-ray release. Unfortunately, nothing new of any relevance has been added to the 2010 Blu-ray, unless you count a paltry less-than-two-minutes \\"sneak peek\\" at PREDATORS or a text and photo Predator profile as worthy additions to the extras. The main audio is the same track from the 2008 Blu-ray: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.     I would urge you not to buy this new Blu-ray edition, and, if you wish, to purchase the 2008 edition [[ASIN:B0012GVKW8 Predator [Blu-ray]]] instead before it goes out-of-print. It might not be perfect, but it is a better presentation of the film than this new 2010 release, and it is therefore the best version of PREDATOR available for home viewing. Hopefully, Fox will feel the fan backlash and release a properly mastered Blu-ray edition soon.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|It's not too often that I buy an entire Rap or Hip Hop recording. Usually I'll just download an occasional song or two from an artist in the category. The last full Rap/Hip Hop CD I bought was [[ASIN:B000023VR6 Dr. Dre's 2001]] way back in 1999, and I haven't felt the need to go any further than downloading the best songs from any Hip Hop CD since then...until today.<br /><br />After listening to Eminem's Recovery, well over an hour's worth of tunes, I would say that the best Rap recording in 10 years has arrived.<br /><br />I don't know what to make of Eminem. He's seems to be mostly angry about something; then next thing you know he's apologizing about this or that in a few songs; then he's crackin' jokes and making fun or just being funny; next he's pouring his heart out in an emotional epic. Regardless, every song on this recording is catchy and in a few cases just brilliant.<br /><br />But I gotta tell ya, even on some of the brilliant songs I was cringing at some of Em's colorful explanations and descriptions of people, places and things. Hoo brother you'd better use your discretion about letting your kids download this one; this recording stretches the limits of PG-13, but ironically my guess is that it is kids around the age of 13+ that you'll find downloading this the most.<br /><br />Whether you think Eminem is White with Black stripes or Black with White stripes, this guy is the real deal. The man is from the street and he's gonna tell you how his day is going...and he's gonna tell you how he REALLY feels. And like I said earlier, some of those feelings are expressed in songs that are effectively emotional like Talkin' to Myself, Not Afraid & Going Through Changes (using a sample from the Black Sabbath song of the same name); some of the songs are charged with energy like Cold Wind Blows, Won't Back Down, &  No Love; and some of the songs are just plain fun like W.T.P. & Cinderella Man.<br /><br />Listeners with weak constitutions should avoid this (W.T.) Party at all costs. But to listeners (fans and non-fans) with an open mind: Do not miss this opportunity. It comes only once in a lifetime. Recovery could just be the record of the year. Add this to your cart. Wait, Em...was that a smile?ans and non-fans) with an open mind: Do not miss this opportunity. It comes only once in a lifetime. Recovery could just be the record of the year.
