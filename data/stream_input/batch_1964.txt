0307971430|5.0|I am a big fan of Reid and LinkedIn and I believe the book gets to the basics of an entrepreneurial world along with the mindset and attitude that is required in order to excel in it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Wow ...before hearing this CD I hadn't realized how beautiful the cello was! What these guys do for the cello and piano is amazing. I love watching their videos and the passion and fun demonstrated in their performances is so inspiring..... I feel the hand of God when I listen to these... thank you!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun for both kids and adults.  Allows us all to enjoy playing together.  We have quite the &#34;running&#34; competition going.
B00991TCOG|4.0|If you like Vanessa Mae and her energy you will love Lindsey Stirling....high energy that gets you rocking for sure
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Have heard about this game for a while now; thought I would try it & turns out...I Love It! Can't go wrong with this game. Lots of fun!
B004XWMXW4|4.0|Amazingly gifted guys...beautiful<br />I would recommend to anyone who likes a modern take on music and someone who enjoys the deep resonance of the cello.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Omg BEST book ever now they got to publish another<br />People should really read this book  l love this book
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very informative, helped me see things from another point of view.  I wish I read this book 8 years ago!
1932100660|5.0|This book is very informative and will really get you thinking.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the truth about nutrition.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was a very good book interesting story,good story line.Better than fifty shades of grey I<br /><br />.Look forward to next one.
B0083Z614S|5.0|An extraordinary classic both children and adults can enjoy. Everything from the mystery of the crying to the excitement of Ben Weatherstaff finding the children was all astounding.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Well written, poignant story.  Touching, nuanced story.  Witty and sad at times.  Highly recommend this page turner.
B005CAAU76|5.0|The Arabic song rocks! They took the risk of writing a song mentioning Ala! Something that sounds risky today because of the religious radicalism of Middle East. JAZZ is not my favorite Queen album but definitely is not bad.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Hearing \\"Some Nights\\" on the radio, and on the trailer for \\"Wreck-it Ralph\\" hooked me.  I bought the disk in case there might be something more than the one song.  I was dismayed by the Autotune in some songs.  If it's noticable, it's generally too much for me.  They even used it a bit in \\"Some Nights\\", but not enough to really bother me.  I remained taken by the one song, but not so much by the rest of the disk.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I was not entirely sure about my decision to purchase this, given that all the materials (except for the drawings, I believe) are available in the public domain. Though when I got a deal for $1, it was a nice investment, since this collection is nicely organized, along with some illustrations. I have to admit that I have not ever read a Holmes story before in my life, and now I am hooked.
B001AQT0RC|3.0|Havent read the book yet although i have it. At the beginning of the movie i enjoyed some of the dialogue concerning M objects and other jargon we amateur astronomers and professional cosmologists use. But, and this is a spoiler, when she finally gets to go on her journey and she finds her dead father its pure bs. Typical hollywood stuff no matter the science behind it. Ill keep it on the shelf but doubt ill watch it again anytime soon.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My grand son loves it.  Plays on it lots.  Down load for your grand.  It is a free game to download
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is much more than we expected! Great&nbsp;features and unique sounds not found in other apps. We can't believe we get so much from a free ap.
B001NFNFNA|5.0|Video  4.6<br />Audio  4.5<br />Extras  2.9<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's Masterpiece.<br />Clint Eastwood's masterpiece has finally arrived this season and it's aptly called: &#34;Changeling&#34;.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I wish I had been able to see this production live.  I hope I can see it someday with this same cast.
0765325950|5.0|I pre ordered this a few months in advance and was very happy to see it on my doorstep when I woke up.  Fast shipping and the book is great so far.  Thanks Amazon for the great price and the release date delivery.<br /><br />EDIT:  I finished the book and WOW was it good.  The Final Battle chapter was around 200 pages.  It would do about a page and a half of one one persons view then switch.  It was very intense and I will be going back and reading this again.  Best book of the series.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|This movie is just amazing. It's hard to believe that its done with only film and NO CGI.. Its also hard to believe that some of these places are here on Earth. Makes you think about things from a totally new perspective. Its like taking a trip around the world yet staying in your living room. They have found locations that no normal person would have access too that are wonderful to see. Get ready for a visual emotional thrill ride.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was well written. The characters were interesting.  The plot was woven together with skill.  It really awakened you to the plight of the slaves.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|Got this as a Christmas and really love it so far have<br />Listened to it every day since Christmas heard the song no<br />light nolight on Tv a couple of times checked out more<br />Songs on u tube and like more songs so I ordered cd
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such an amazing book. It kept me wanting to read more and more til I finished it. I can't wait to continue on to the next one!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Engaging, a bit long winded towards the end.  A quick weekend read.  I enjoyed it but I thinks it's really more a high school/ young adult book
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Unless I'm jumping the gun, this App works perfectly. Uploads New stories in news feed and I can scroll down to earlier posts. Hope my good luck continues!
B006ZZANG0|5.0|I'm a huge fan and have seen Rufus in concert several times.  This is by far my favorite album by my favorite artist.  He is such an incredible singer and song writer.  Out of the game is incredible!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is an amazing game!!!!! And I hope u all like it to because I know a couple of cheats so please tell your friends about it because I am the one who made this game so I can remove it from ur dock just saying and like this please ok remember I can remove it so please like and tell ur friends and I will tell u cheats ok?
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Loved finding these lost treasures by someone we lost too soon.  Listen to it often with my playlist of Rufus Wainwright.  Beautiful.
B000003N89|4.0|Alone and blue. The album is music of lost relationships that did not quite make it. It feels like long cold nights alone in a dark apartment.  Things just did not work out in the field of love.  Diana Krall, whatever  she puts her voice to is mellow and like a vase of spring flowers. Her songs are always a good addition to any jazz collection.
B000VZUM5C|5.0|Such a great album.  Memories of the 70's and the beginning of my love for Patti Austin and James Ingram.  An all time favorite!
B0086700CM|4.0|Run for your life! This Indiana Jones type game is simple to learn and easy to play. It's challenging and fun and very, very addictive. Best of all it's free. Put this one on your phnoe or tablet right now.
B006W33UC4|5.0|Tom Moulton does the best remixes in the industry.  This collection is a must have for anyone who loves dance music from the 70's.  A wonderful collection of gems.
0393334988|5.0|Compelling story, conveyed with candor and respect not only for the language but for the participants involved. I'm rarely moved to tears by a book, but this one &#34;got&#34; to me, and its emotional reverberations echo down the years.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I expected more. It was ok. Great cameos and the random 80's jokes were funny, but Family guy / American Dad / Cleveland show are all funnier.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grandson was delighted with this gift.  So many things to do diffinitely kept his interest.  He really enjoyed this item.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good series<br />Good descriptions<br />Good movie from series<br />Great author<br />Looking forward to read this series of books on my kindle
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read a lot and this is definitely a five star book!! I could easily relate to the characters and the writing was superb! You could feel the love Sky and Holder had for each other and how their young love blossomed throughout the book. It's definitely worth reading!!
B00632HWOG|4.0|This app is amazing for just viewing things, but I have not discovered how to actually send emails to people.This may just be because I don't know or it could be impossible.It is still pretty great!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|My main reason to get this was so I would have the convenience to read the pdf's I get sent to me, or the online documents (school lunch menu, sports schedules) that are in pdf form. So far, it's either the fire browser or the docs that don't seem to like it. When it works, it's great.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christmas present for my son. He requested it, loves the batman movies. He is very pleased with his Christmas gift.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Very successful writer looking for his new character, his mother a former actress and a little flighty, his daughter with her head on straight, and a woman detective NYPD who, after bringing the author in to consult on a case, becomes the unwilling inspiration for his next series.
B000002C1W|3.0|I like most of Pink Floyd's work and even bought some of their vinyl when I was a young lad.  I liked some, didn't like others.<br /><br />For lack of a better description, this album just didn't feel right to me.  It's like they were just throwing in some New Age and other genres for flavor but not in an organized way.  To me, the two tracks that stand out are \\"Learning To Fly\\" and \\"On The Turning Away\\".  They are so good that it makes you feel like you're wading through random sounds on the other tracks just to get between those two songs.<br /><br />Make no mistake, there are some gems on this album.  It's just my personal opinion that it didn't have an overall contiguous feel like Dark Side of the Moon and some of their other work.
B000002URV|5.0|I listen to this CD all the time in my car. Beautiful music to listen to after a hard days work.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Kearns tells Lincoln's story by focusing not only on him, but on the individuals and setttings that helped to shape him andn his ideas throughout his political career. It's a must read for anyone who loves American history and a great entre into biography for those who are not yet fans of this genre or of history in general
1400069289|5.0|This book is fascinating! I bought it for my husband since self-improvement is more of his kind of thing. I on the other hand, do not read \\"self-help\\" books unless I am required to. Still I picked up the book one day, just to glance over it and I ended up reading about 60 pages without being able to stop. The information is so (as I said before) fascinating , and the author knows how to deliver it just right. It is entertaining while being helpful and I can't wait for my husband to put it down long enough so I can steal another session with it.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|This definitely lives up to Criterion's usual high standards, and it's nice to see all of the content from their original Laserdisc version coming over to the blu-ray.  Absolutely worth the purchase if you're a fan of the movie or of David Fincher.
B003VANOFY|4.0|These are great, quite, and comfortable; they fit over the ear rather than on the ear.  Virtual haircut is eerie.
B001B51B9M|5.0|The songs are great, the blu-ray looks incredible, and I think you either have to hate musicals or older movies to not really enjoy The Music Man.  Sure, it's the overdone staple of high school theaters everywhere, but it's just good fun.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My grandchildren love this game They argue over whose turn it is and that one played longer than they were supposed to
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Although I haven't seen the 3D version, watching this blu-ray was really like seeing the movie in the theater all over again.  The picture quality is excellent, the sound blew me away, and the movie is just as good now as when it originally came out.
B004DM0UII|5.0|Awesome little stream player, nice features (app standalone volume, equalizer, bass boost and room virtualization) included that makes some other external audio apps obsolete, very happy with this app!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am usually pretty good at guessing \\"what happens next\\" , but not with this book. I was fascinated throughout and for awhile expected a utopian end to the story because of Kennedy's life being spared. But that would have been ridiculous. It ended just right.
B0061QD7ZM|5.0|This movie is a classic and for the price getting 2 disc was great. I absolutely love all disney movies
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken follett is absolutely the very best author. He has a very compelling way of writing history<br />And fiction so that you actually feel as though your there. I never want his books to end and can not wait for the next.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I'm a Mac user, and when I realized recently that wireless headsets even exist, I made it my mission to find the best one. I tested the Corsair Vengeance 2000, the Logitech G930, and the Creative Sound Blaster Tactic 3D Wrath.<br /><br />Disclaimer in advance: I'm don't really play video games, and I'm not an audiophile. I work from home in a way that requires me to move around my house a lot, and I like listening to everything from classical music to Gogol Bordello to GirlTalk to broadway musicals while I work. Up to now, I've been using Sound Clarity® NC500SC -- which I think are really stellar (especially considering I got them for free; hooray for being the only guy that cleaned out storage rooms at my last job) -- but of course they're wired and don't have audio input. Anyway.<br /><br />The first of the three I tried was the Corsair Vengeance 2000.<br />- These things are huge. It might be the right look for someone who takes alien-blasting really seriously, but I wasn't a big fan. Plus, they didn't seem very portable because of their size.<br />- The sound was fine but nothing miraculous and the worst of the three.<br />- I don't remember a thing about the microphone which must mean it wasn't particularly noteworthy either. THAT SAID, the Corsair did have that feature where it relays the audio input through the output in real-time -- or however the hell you're supposed to say when you talk into the mic, it relays the sound through the headphones, so you don't sound in your head like you're talking into a mattress.<br />- On the PC it might be a different story, but with no drivers available for Mac there wasn't a whole lot of room for adjustments.<br />Conclusion: I had them back in the box and ready to return within an hour.<br /><br />The next was the Logitech G930. The Creative took a long time to ship so I used the Logitech for a good week-ish.<br />- Major bonus points for the on-ear controls. I loved being able to use the volume wheel and REALLY lovedthe programmable buttons. It was awesome being able to pause and switch songs from 20 feet away.<br />- The sound was better than the Corsair, but there was still a lot of \\"splashiness\\" and topping-out on the bass. It bothered me enough to really make me look forward to getting the Creative, hoping they'd sound better.<br />- Pretty durable design. My biggest design beef was that when the ear cups were turned down to lie flat for storage, the unit was really wide and space-inefficient. Not particularly good for taking around with you.<br />- The mic was fine. Nothing fancy. About what I'm used to for a headset. I liked that the microphone can be flipped up to stay out of your face, and automatically goes on mute when you do so.<br />- I liked how they fit over my ears. My ears didn't get sweaty and had some room. Plus, the design of the cups was pretty good at blocking outside sound.<br />- I was a bit disappointed when the battery wore down for the first time. It didn't take nearly as long as I'd hoped, and there wasn't really a warning: suddenly the unit just turned off.<br /><br />Finally I got the Creative Sound Blaster Tactic 3D Wrath.<br />- I have them on right now, and holy cow, this bass is AMAZING. The sound quality in general is faaaantastic. No contest here. There's a very, very, very slight background of white noise, but I don't mind that at all since I think it has an external noise-canceling effect.<br />- The mic's fine. Sounds a little bit like I'm talking into a tin can, but whatevs; I'm not planning on recording an album with these. Just tested it with Audacity on which it was pretty quiet by default, and on Skype where the volume was peachy.<br />- They sure fit snug! Normally I don't like snugness, but the pressure's well-distributed and there aren't any outstanding pressure points.<br />- These aren't around-the-ear phones like the Logitech; the pads sit right on the circumference of my ear. This is nice because I feel really sucked into the sound and there isn't any external interference. This will also be a problem because I can already tell my ears are going to get sweaty and uncomfortable. Other reviewers have said the headphones loosen up after a few days, though, so we'll see how that goes.<br />- The controls on the headphones are basic -- volume and mute.<br />- Wow! Software that actually works on a Mac! Major props simply for not feeling like I'm missing out on all kinds of features because I'm not on a PC.<br /><br />I do really miss the programmable buttons of the Logitech. But I think the sound quality is so good on the Creative that I'll stick with these babies.<br /><br />1st place: Creative Sound Blaster Tactic 3D Wrath<br />2nd place: Logitech G930<br />3rd place: Corsair Vengeance 2000
B001EN71CW|5.0|I cannot believe how short lived this series was. It has great humor, great fight scenes, great cast, in hilarious situations and you start liking them right off.. Worth every penny to see it uncut, without commercials, and in high definition.
B000I186FW|5.0|Really enjoyed this. Maybe not the best \\"production\\" but I am a storyline guy anyways and I always love the classic hero movies.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The only thing is I can't figure out how to delete paths since they go in automatically when you put in an animal
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Imagine if you will, a budding artist.  Setting out on his journey through life.  A life filled with poorness, art school, rejection, art showings, rejection, studio apartments, rejection, and sometimes even fame.<br /><br />You may have noticed a theme.<br /><br />Throughout the budding artists life there are long bouts of time where they will have no money, no friends, and lots of time.  What's a dude to do?<br /><br />Play this game, that's what.  Finally a game filled with free expression, drawing, adventure, and most of all time-wasting-zero-judgement funness!<br /><br />Draw up a stick man and set off on an epic quest to save your buddy from the throngs of some awesome hand drawn evil!  Its loads of fun to play over and over.  In many ways its almost better to have a sickly looking Quazimodo stick man than it is to have a beautiful work of art.<br /><br />The game is as fun to look at as it is to play.  The art school dropout in me weeps for joy every time I play it as does my inner child.<br /><br />Buy this game.  You will be happy you did.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Knowing of the popularity of the author, I looked forward to reading this book.  BUT, I found it to be a very sad, depressing look at what must be current day England/Scotland.  The dreadful way parents talk to children, the empty lives of these people, their anger and smallness, is just terribly disheartening, despite an attempt, at the end to find graciousness in the misery.  This book depicts a dreary, hopeless world, almost unrelieved throughout.  I don't think that JK Rowling's showing us all this underbelly will change anything.  I'm so tired at having this outlook shoved in front of me at every turn.  These are not pictures of reality as I live and know it; they are distressing prophesies that, with a modicum of the milk of human kindness, I personally hope and trust will never come true.  I think art, music, TV, literature and movies should climb out of the mire and show us a positive possible world.  Give me Alexander McCall Smith anyday.  44 Scotland Street is intelligent, kindly, loving, philosophical, inspiring, EDIFYING.  So what, pray tell, is wrong about that.  Skip the cool chic and give me uplifting material.  We would all be the better for it.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Who can fault the need for the Adobe reader.  I use it for the instruction file for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 since it, and none of the other tablets I have seen include much in the way of paper.  This software is always useful.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is so wonderful. I love that the author can depict such intimate, sexual encounters and then go straight into a whirlwind of drama.  She does so without compromising the fact that there is a palpable feeling of love.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|When I first heard about the movie I laughed and moved on. I recently gave it a chance after seeing the many favorable reviews here at Amazon. As the title implies I did not go into the film thinking I was going to be entertained, but I was wrong. Dredd is a brutal sci-fi action film that has a rather straight forward plot from start to finish. The ride may not be full of surprises or leave you pondering some philosophical question but is quite entertaining and time well spent. If you think the words \\"bad ass\\" qualify as an appropriate descriptor for a movie you would like to watch, then look no further.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show ALWAYS makes me laugh.  Got this as a gift but would like to have all seasons to keep in my library.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this one, it's accurate, it's fun to check other areas.  Great for travelers or anyone living as I do in a rapidly changeable area.  It was sunny yesterday, the snow is coming down in buckets at the moment.
B000002B2T|5.0|This is a unique little gem worth owning especially if you're a fan of Layne Staley. Above is one of those albums I'll have to listen to a few times before I can fully appreciate it. The lyrics are great, the music is great. If you're a fan of any of the guys in Mad Season this album is definitely worth getting.<br />Of course now there will be a deluxe version available in April. So if you really loved this album, would like some cool extras, and you're willing to pay a bit more just wait and buy that copy. Or if you're a huge Layne Staley fan who wants as much of his work as possible, wait for the deluxe version. I would've waited but I didn't know so now I'll end up buying this again with all of the extras.
006056251X|5.0|Well, there are thousands of romance novels about the rakes falling for the shy ladies, but this one was actually believable, witty and so romantic without being cheesy that I absolutely loved it. And it was rewarding to see that once the emotions were involved, the stuttering young lady was actually the stronger one in the relationship.<br /><br />Lisa Kleypas definitely knows how to write a romance - this is the 3rd book of the Wallflower series and they are all definitely a keeper.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|I love this DVD, it's nice having having all of the videos (well the old videos anyway) all together. I'm a younger fan, I was 5 when the last full album featuring Layne Staley was released so this is really cool for fans who were too young to really appreciate this material in the 1990s. DVDs like this and MTV Unplugged are the only ways people my age will ever be able to see Layne. Alice In Chains was an amazing band and this DVD shows that. I'm sure the newer stuff is great but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
B008QMMEOE|1.0|My three year old son loves the game but within the first ten minutes of playing he managed to pay the $1.99 in order to unlock the full version of the game. When you start the game you will see the available puzzles, half of which are greyed out. When clicking on the greyed out puzzles you are taken to the amazon app which asks for confirmation on the $1.99 price for the full version. It is inevitable that a young child will click on the greyed out puzzles and purchase the full version. I would have liked to see if my son grew tired of the free version quickly before I decided to go and purchase the rest of the puzzles.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Both my 13 year old daughter and 10 year old son love the Percy Jackson series. My daughter, who is a big reader loves the strong female character. My son loves the adventure and battles. The story definitely holds their attention and fuels their imagination!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This app has really helped me. Now in the morning I can wake up and know how cold it is outside.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|INTERESTING insights into wartime Germany, especially the numbers of people opposed to the regime. (With SOME haunting parallels of the United States today). I believe that young people of that day were much more insightful and thoughtful than those today.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|it's about a girl going to college who has a passion for music and wants to be a DJ. her dad is a professor at the college and wants her to join at least one club/group. one day she is given the permission to try out for the &#34;Barden Bellas&#34;(a singing group that competes)...watch the trailer for a better description of this movie.
1451695195|5.0|I've read and listened to a great many NDE experiences since the early 80s. I find it hard to beleave that so many people still have doubts about God and Heaven. It boggles my mind that so many people don't even want to investigate beyond the closed doors of their mind. I hope that a few doubters will give this book a try. Maybe it wont change their minds. It seems many doors are glued shut. When they need it most the information contained within this somewhat thin book could ease a few journeys into the personal unknown and, perhaps, it will cause some to call upon God when they need Him most and recognize the errors of their ways. That said this book is well written and easy to read. An amazing journey - if only he could have brought a camera! Maybe someday science will be able to read the images stored within his mind and we can all loose ourselves within the majestic specticles of Heaven and all doubt of God and His love for us will be erased forever!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent read. Highly recommend this book to anyone who has even the slightest interest into an inside perpective of a man of war and the dynamics of his passion for his job and his responsibilities as a husband and father.Could hardly put the book down. Both interesting and informative
B0036S4B6M|3.0|There are definately better books out there than this one.  Still a good book nonetheless.  It's a fast and easy read, and what i liked about it was the 1st hand description of prison life.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Not quite as good as the t.v. show but still a good mystery.<br />The book makes him look a little silly, whereas on the t.v. show his character is more 'cute' than silly.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|The story was more childish than than the other stories, but of course the characters did play their parts well and it was entertaining. I want my stories to have some premise in fact so that children can be taught things, not just be a bunch of jumbled events.  This was cute, but just jumbled events, thus the 3 star rating.
B0086700CM|5.0|I know this review is one of many but I thought I would say it is a great  game I have it on my phone and tablet and every time I play it it is addictive and loads of fun. It allows creativity and even strategy it is so simple in some ways yet the best game I ever downloaded. If you are downloading it for yourself or your kids I guarantee that it is the best game you can get for free and it will be played all the time.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|I was pleasantly suprised how entertaining it was.  I even found myself curious about Scandanavian myth and lore after this film.  Despite the fact the film is one of those first person camera films, the story is presented in a way that you can follow. Awesome special effects.  I look at high tension power lines differently now. I reccomend this to anyone who like a good monster hunt and isn't scared off by sub-titles.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have always enjoyed this game. Easy to see and play, You will enjoy this game alot<br />and play it even more.
4770031246|5.0|This book is great if you're just starting to cook. It's very well organized and gives great details. I can't wait to start!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Fun Game, I did not enjoy all the pop ups, so I put the game on the back burner in my game list
0452287022|5.0|Fantastic Book!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|It was easy to see Downton Abbey and a nice addition to our Prime membership.  May I suggest adding CC in English?  Netflix has this available for their 2010 episodes.  Having English CC helped us with some of the 'English' we couldn't quite get.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it.  Really enjoy being able to access from my Kindle.  Just as good as on the computer and good for all approved ages.
0765325950|1.0|Many of us are not reading paper anymore. It sucks that we are made to wait for a digital edition.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great fun. easy but challenging. Free makes this one even better. ready to pick up more like this. So what are you waitibg for.
B003ZYJS5Q|5.0|These 180g pressings of the mono versions of Dylan's first eight albums are superb, and at the price Amazon is selling the set for an incredible bargain -- a bit over $18 a disc.  The earlier albums really shine in mono, and the mono versions of the later masterpieces are the definitive ones -- the way Dylan expected them to be heard by most people.  If you have the capacity to play vinyl, this set ought to be one of the cornerstones of your collection, just as the albums themselves together represent one of the cornerstones of American culture.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've ever gotten for free!  I love this game!  So addicting!  I definitely suggest it.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Long before I actually read this I am stating outright, that I am NOT giving this five stars. It is male heavy. A male world of war. AND MOST OF ALL THERE IS NO TEXT-TO-SPEECH AND IT IS NOT LOANABLE! That means that on top of buy the book at nearly $9, I had to go buy the Audible version which was nearly $42. I doubt I will even get around to listening/reading it. I have watched the series. I liked the dragon lady character. But other than that it is NOT worth it! $51 for ONE book? And I can't share it with the few friends I know that might not have read it? So, even if this is a five star story (which I doubt) I don't plan on giving more than three stars.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Okay, the writing, story, characters, world all deserve 5 stars. This was an excellent story. It wasn't male heavy as I previously had thought. It was a realistic thought on ancient patriarchal philosophies but hints of some who didn't hold to those thoughts. Five women held their own in the cast of characters, Dany my favorite. Just as it was on the television series. Still, had my adult children not been so in to these books I wouldn't have read even the first. But they encouraged me to give them a try and wouldn't let up until I gave in. Now I am addicted to the story and will do what I can to read and listen to the rest of the series.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I have bakery story and restaurant story and i love playing them but will probably uninstall them because amazon doesn't update these apps. Either i get an update way after everyone else or i don't get them at all. They never posted the christmas versions of either and it was no longer fun as i was the only neighbor without a lot of items. I never got any christmas dec and missed out on a new oven and all the holiday food. oh well it was fun for awhile. ;(
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this game every day! I wish there more coins, but will keep playing as much as I can.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this game but they really should have a conformation button when buying Colorado with the coins you get. I was looking at the choices and suddenly a check came up beside a set of Colorado I do NOT want. you only get 3 coin for the hard drawing &amp; the colors cost 240 coins. so it will take forever to get the colors I really want and I'm stuck with ones I don't want.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I highly recommend The Hunger Games! It is my new favorite book! I am really looking forward to book two!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|It was soft and fits nicely under my granddaughter's arm. She won't be without it now....she is 19 months old.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This a fantastic series.  My wife and I loved it!  We highly recommend this one!!  Can't wait for season 3!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|It's hard to find a CD where you like more than 1 song on it but this 1 is really good.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I didn't read the book myself, but my kids said they loved it. One of them finished it in 2 days and that says a lot!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So I read this book because of all the good reviews but honestly I don't understand the fuss. There's not really much of a plot at all. Some parts are interesting, but too much sex not enough plot -for me anyway
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Very graphic, but it's amazing to see what these men and women really went through for our country. Don't let your children watch lots of nudity and sex scenes.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Looking online, the only cheaper prices on the Castle Seasons are on dubious sites with bad reviews - implying they are pirated copies from China.  We didn't want to risk it and bought these, and the quality is perfect.
0385535147|4.0|Yet another story from Grisham that I cannot put down once started.  The characters were well developed and you just have to keep going to see where he goes with them.  Not as good as his earlier novels, the suspense is not there, but a twist 2/3 of the way through it will push you to finish.
0525423656|5.0|My daughter loves this series and wanted to own them.  Great price and easy to order as usual from Amazon.
0765325950|5.0|Great ending to a great series. Buy the hardcover. It is not going to hurt to hold a book and turn each page manually.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Looking online, the only cheaper prices on the Castle Seasons are on dubious sites with bad reviews - implying they are pirated copies from China.  We didn't want to risk it and bought these, and the quality is perfect.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|You dedicate your life to develope your skill, your ability in your field. Your effort grows into somehting that is respected by all you service, your are passionate and determine, but just can't make it over that wall where &#34;the big boys&#34; operate.<br /><br />This is the book for you.<br />It is well written, easily read with straight to the point outcomes for a busy person.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Looking online, the only cheaper prices on the Castle Seasons are on dubious sites with bad reviews - implying they are pirated copies from China.  We didn't want to risk it and bought these, and the quality is perfect.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I hadn't read a novel in a while and was needing a quick, good read.  It was perfect. Good writing, nice interposition of character perspectives and parts of it still haunt me.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Looking online, the only cheaper prices on the Castle Seasons are on dubious sites with bad reviews - implying they are pirated copies from China.  We didn't want to risk it and bought these, and the quality is perfect.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this app keeps you going. A lot of fun<br />. looking forward to more levels.  keep them coming. this games is very challenging.
0765325950|5.0|This was a wonderful book, and a great ending to an even greater series. Deal with it.<br /><br />The fact that many of you are rating the BOOK itself with one star simply because it is not available in ebook format yet is SHAMEFUL. You can whine, cry, and have a temper tantrum, but please don't rate the book poorly simply because (as of this review) it is not available as an ebook. Absolutely disgusting.<br /><br />*PLEASE REPORT 1 STAR REVIEWS AS ABUSE IF THEY ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT FORMAT AND NOT THE BOOK'S ACTUAL CONTENT*
B00742GBDM|4.0|I realize that this movie isn't 100% true to the book, but I forgive them because I truly believe that Jane herself would like the spunkiness of this Fanny. There are a few seconds of screen time that I wish they hadn't inserted in a couple of places (all fans know just what I'm talking about). Jane herself was obstinately non-political, and that is the biggest change they made in this movie that probably would bother Jane, but it does so much to help us understand Tom, that I am forgiving. Dang it, this is still the best Mansfield Park version, hands down. Spoiler alert: It has one of the best almost kisses in cinematic history.
141659521X|5.0|This book is most likely as real a description of the spy world as any in recent time.<br />It has the complications of the US and it's politics and all the international spy networks (and their Politics) , That's why I seleted the title RW, Real World.<br />Mr. Flynn has set a new high for me.<br /><br />J J Riolo
B003DNN0L2|4.0|My family LOVES this movie, and quote it all the time. I'm not the greatest fan, but got it for my kids' enjoyment. The stop motion process is AMAZING, however, and it is very clever.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|Its worth reading a few times!  Make sure you get the Katherine Woods translation.  The new translation is not as good.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|I love all things Austen and am very picky. This is the BEST Sense and Sensibility. Period. Ironically, the more recent version draws from THIS version rather than the book itself, in some cases, and obviously did their best to find an Emma Thompson sound alike in their casting of Eleonora Dashwood. Don't waste your time, THIS is the version to cherish. It's a stellar performance by every single person in the cast.
B0044XV684|5.0|MY SON LOVES TRYING TO MAKE SNACKS FROM THE RECIPES . HE FEELS LIKE HE IS GROWN UP , WHEN HE MAKES SNACKS FOR WHEN HIS FRIENDS COME OVER TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|It is very challenging and sometimes maddening to maneuver the pieces but will capture your interest for hours. It is better than games that are too easy.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I would give this game 5 stars if it was able to be trnaferred from one device to another. i worked on my town for over a year, had lots of money and acorns. I went from a kindle fire to a fire hd and was not able to transfer all my success!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book. It was very hard to put down. Lots of twists and turns. The ony thing I didn't like was that I thought it ended too abruptly. I wanted more.
0792845668|5.0|I bought this for the kids and it arrived in flawless condition with quick shipping. Glad my kids enjoyed a movie I remember from my youth. Thanx for a smooth transaction.
B00785P2QC|5.0|If you enjoy these types of games you'll love the challenges of this game! Once you start playing its hard to stop!
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|First contact to me is the best Star Trek episodes ever in the movie version.  Very well written and the special effects were great!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is an insightful look at teen issues. The characters have stayed with me even though I finished the book a few weeks ago.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|The details of this van are amazing, watch the youtube clip with the designer to find out. Great value buy compared to some other Legos of similar size/pieces. Great present for adults.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Ripped through it in a few days. Not terrifying per se, but King through & through nonetheless. Well worth the dough layed down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Being but a teenager, there were many words in this novel that I could not comprehend, but note  that what I did understand was the message John Green was trying to send. It was that we are all pointless,that we cannot hurt, nor help this universe. But the only thing that we can do is recognise it. We need to stop trying to make marks on the world, and start realizing what we can do. I would definitely read this book no matter your age, because the message it sends is universal. This book was truly an eye-opener. And I hope that it spoke to you as well
1608871088|5.0|The book is wonderful and the art is simply gorgeous! The book is quite big and surprisingly heavy, but all the better! It shows sketches and small rough drafts of the characters and a lot of background details as well!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an amazing conclusion to the trilogy. I was again riveted and couldn't put it down. Bravo Suzanne Collins!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|President Lincoln has done alot for this country, and even behind the scene he was fighting the darkest od evil.  I find this interesting plot with a twist in history.
1451613512|5.0|I am extremely happy with the purchase of '..Untold History..'<br />It is a treasure for the collection.  Soft pages, well designed, and beautiful print.  It is packed with information and references.  It's true, there is no reason to hide the realities of Our History, clear away the clouds of dissonance, process the often cruel truths of the American Empire.  See how close it is, and how different it would be, between a McKinley and a Jennings Bryan, a Bush Jr. and an Albert Gore, an Obama or a Romney...
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Like all Grisham books this one is very well written. Each chapter keeps you wanting to read more. The part that i liked the best is that the ending took a twist that i wasn't expecting.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Have enjoyed this movie over and over and am so glad to now have my own copy of it as well.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|'Awakenings' is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is especially powerful and inspiring because it is based on a true story. Similar in ways to Robin Williams's later film, 'Patch Adams,' this movie will leave you deeply moved. If you are a Robin Williams fan who enjoys his comedic movies but is seeking something a little more drama and a little less humor, this is the perfect movie for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome book. Page turner, intensifying. Won,t want to sleep till you finish the book. Can't wait<br />To read the next book:)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|wow, like watching a movie! suspenseful and great cast. if you go to show time website, you can watch first episode of season two for free.
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|An easy read. Kept my attention on a hot day.More detailed information about Victoria and other characters such as Meredith's life and family would have rounded the story out.
B009S6ZKSO|5.0|This is absolutely amazing! If you're a die hard Kelly Clarkson fan, this is for you! Unlike the US version of the album, this deluxe edition has bonus tracks AND all of Kelly's music videos!! I LOVE IT!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A must read with implications especially for any health care professional<br />whose ultimate therapeutic goal is true healing of the human condition. Serves as a powerful reminder of the innate God-given worth and dignity in each of us since we are created in the image and likeness of Him.
B0002IQOZA|5.0|Christina never disappoints! This album is great! If you like Christmas music, you'll love this album!! I cannot stop listening to it!
B004SIP6BI|5.0|The copy was good!  Our DVD player was able to read and play it.  We really enjoyed watching the movie.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|OMG! This movie is amazing! I'm gay and I saw it in theaters and I HAD to get the DVD! The plot isn't incredible... but the MEN make this worth it!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|A great fast paced read.  Right up there with Tales of Paksenarion. Well written with in a new world thread. Very enjoyable
0062202081|5.0|I bought this book for a friend and she finished it in just TWO days. She says it was incredible. Also, shipping on this product was FAST!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|An approachable, character-driven story which develops nicely.  As another reviewer said, the chapters dealing with the orphanage are difficult to read due to the content.  I liked this book - it was nice to read it front of the fire with a glass of wine during the few cold winter nights we get here in Texas.
B00009XITQ|5.0|Terrific movie. Watch it often. What is also good about it is I'm able to watch with my granddaughter. Love the music in it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love Downton Abbey, can't wait to see what they are up to in each new episode.  How the rich have no idea what's going on around them.
B00006674X|5.0|This is a very good movie. All the actors were good. Love Elvis and Mary Tyler Moore. The end makes you draw your own conclusions as to how it ends.
B003XT603Q|5.0|I've loved every book I've read by Murakami, but I think this one may be more accessible to people who are less inclined to the surreal. The characters have very real problems and it is easy to identify with and get attached to them. Still, there are people out there who don't want to read anything unhappy. If you are one of these, avoid this book. If, like me, you love to empathise with characters who are having serious trouble, this is the book for you.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|i so luv this movie and i couldn't find it anywhere.  I searched everywhere.  but i found it here and it worked well
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love coin push games. This one doesn't disappoint. The physics are fairly accurate and the wait time isn't too bad.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game rules. You can upgrade weapons. Great soundtrack. It's like a hybrid of classic 80's style video arcade space games...highly recommend.
B000W9399S|5.0|I saw the made-for-tv movie of this and thought it was fun, so I decided to grab the book. I was not disappointed. I found myself laughing out loud fairly frequently, and even subjecting whoever was in the room with me to a passage or two that I found particularly amusing. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for some wit and chuckles, and a good book you can just have fun with and not want to put down.. If you liked \\"Hitchhikers Guide,\\" you'll enjoy this. Would make a great poolside or vacation read as well.  And for those who finish this one, \\"The Light Fantastic,\\" is the second half of this novel.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|good book.  I didn't want to stop reading, because I wanted to see what was going to happen next. Can't wait to read the next one.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is a great app it helps me keep organized and is great for school. SoI think u should take your time and buy this app and you will love it just like I do.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Can't stop watching... I've been watching Merlin since season 1. First season was campy & seemed low budgeted however the Camelot environment, costumes were done well. What keeps me watching is the cast and Merlin & Author's relationship and funny banter. Each season really raises the expectations and doesn't disappoint. Merlin seemed like a hidden gem on BBC1 and now I've gotten several friends & family members Addicted. Season 4 is the most complex, dark & magical. It draws you in and envelopes you into Merlin's world where he is always growing and encountering daily struggles and destiny's dilemma. I'm such a Morgana fan. Wow she can change her hair at 4-6 times in an episode. Amazing. Because it's done by BBC1 earlier seasons are hard to come by & Syfy reruns are rare. Some have found season 4 on youtube. My comcast on-demand seems to dump the last season pretty quickly not like CSI, Mentalist & NCIS which run marathons daily forever. Seasons 1-3 are only on Dvd probably because of BBC1 but season 4 is on bluray. Wish they would do a re-run of Bluray & DVD like on Game of Thrones S1-2 so you can enjoy it on all devices.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have liked all the Pendergast books, but this one is my favorite. The plot is complex and very fast moving. I could not put the book down.
1609611543|1.0|AFTER MUCH READING, AND CHECKING OUT RESTAURANTS AND TRYING OUT GLUTEN FREE BREAD I WAS DISAPPOINTED. THE BREAD HAS TO STAY FROZEN OR IT SPOILS QUICKLY. MY DOCTORS EVEN AGREE THAT IT ISN'T AS IMPORTANT AS IT SEEMS TO BE. I LOOK FOR GLUTEN FREE WHEN POSSIBLE BUT I DON'T LIVE OR DIE BY IT.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just love this game because it gets me so excited about my new high score that I will get.
0307719219|5.0|A real world view of everything.  Also read their Blog.  Best way to look at any form of progress or development anywhere; can even use it in business or in education and label the extractive inhibitors or the facilitative enablers...
B006RXSM9A|5.0|Chicago is one of the best musicals I have every seen. Its a long movie but you don't even notice. I love pretty much every musical number.
0195073401|5.0|If you are in an economics PhD program hopefully your classes use this text as it is the standard in the field.  Yes everyone has their own idea about curriculum, but everything here is a must.
1595828753|5.0|This book is a nice little serving of all the action and quirkiness of the original show. I love it. It really satisfies any fan who was left lingering for more. The book was like brand new.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|When I saw the movie trailer I thought this was an interesting series. It had everything I liked or so I thought. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />The characters are flat and the interactions seemed forced as well as the characters relationships. The writing was also awkward at times though there was some witty dialogue.<br /><br />It was a little disappointing when there was only three fighting scenes. Not a lot of demon slaying going on. Clary can't fight yet she's constantly in the middle of the fights. That makes no sense.<br /><br />Clary also seems shallow especially during the vampire fight. When she commented on the no ugly vampires and how ugly people didn't want to live forever. Well excuse you, but I would like to live forever. Just saying.<br /><br />It was a struggle to finish. Now that it's over and the story finally got interesting. I'm going to read the second installment to see if it has some  redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? If you're looking for a quick fix then this  book is for you. If you want something more in-depth I suggest you look else where.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|All the usual suspects are back again. Your favorite characters are all reprised, and Clancy puts a good twist on cyber-terrorism, and has obviously done his research. All in all a good read
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I have never had a better reason to be afraid of the dark and the things that go bump in the night. This is a wonderful series filled with interesting creatures and some good laughs as well. Definitely a must see for fans of the paranormal.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved loved loved it. Enough twists and turns with very strong sex scenes. I highly recommend this trilogy. It will be hard to read any similar books as I don't know how it will compete with this one. Definitely looking forward to the movie.
B00005JLKB|3.0|Though the series does not follow the comics very closely it is a great show that tries to detail the life of Clark Kent and his struggle with becoming a superhero. A good first season to kick off the interest of superhero fans.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Awsome great book I'm reading it for a class project that we are doing really good for chapter 1 and 2
B009U9S6FI|5.0|this was an incredible book that was thoughtfully written. the author gave personal accounts and feelings that make you examine your own life. so often we sit back and ask what' s in this for me, the author encourages the reader to look outside of that and think of those around you. I highly recommend this book!
B005LAII3U|2.0|I had heard such great things about this movie that I pre-ordered it.  I could barely stay awake through it!  Maybe I was hoping for something more along the lines of the original Total Recall, but this was just slow and boring.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I guess with the Christmas rush there is still a chance that it will arrive, but my hopes are dwindling.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have loved this trilogy and the development of the characters.  By this book, I found the sex scenes were a distraction from the story (not that they were bad, I just wanted to read more about the characters).  In the first book, I thought Grey was a jerk with a soft side that would come out once in a while.  By the end of this book, I realized that he is a sweet loving man who is scared and puts up a front to keep others from getting close.<br /><br />There was a lot of closure in this book and a lot of healing.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|It's the Walking Dead!!  The dead - they're walking!  People are trying to survive.  It's terrible and thrilling and awesome and horrible and Daryl has a crossbow.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The journey continues and is crowing more intriguing!  I was really sad at the end of book one so I'm glad I read book two quickly after.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Don't get me wrong, the book was good and I enjoyed it, but 3/4 of the way though the book you knew exactly how it was going to turn out and at that same point in the book there is a lot of jumping around in the chapters.  I enjoy Nicholas Sparks and it won't stop me from picking up his books again, but this is definitely not one of his best.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|In the beginning of this book, Anna seems naive and awkward. Her character seems to grow a lot by the end and sees the world a little differently.  Christian in a little scary with a secret past and a passion for play that isn't quite mainstream.  I enjoyed the character development just as much as I did the hot sex scenes. I thought it ended way to abruptly so I downloaded book two right away!
0756697875|5.0|It has so much information about lego batman and the text is great for kids and their parents to read. I personally love the book it's great!!!!!
B005UA0FLE|4.0|Great music and great album. shows the range of the artist. would recommend this and other of this artist work.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|obviously you read the previous books if you got to this one. It is the best one so far. mindblowingly amazing! MUST READ!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I bought this book because a friend suggested it, loved it. I couldn't ever put it down. It sucks you in and you feel a part of this book. I recommend this.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|I like the Cd even though I'm not a huge Ri Ri fan. My favorite song is Jump been playing it when I workout. Upbeat enough to keep me moving.
B006QQQ5SI|4.0|First of all, we loved the movie.  Light-hearted fun, whether or not you are into birds (I am, my husband is not).  Other reviewers will tell you more about the movie. My gripe is although we selected the 'extended edition' through Amazon Instant Video, there was nothing (really, truly nothing) extra about it.  It was the movie.  Period.  That's fine if it is what you are expecting - not so much if you are looking forward to the additional features.  If there was a way I could rate 4 stars for the movie, and 2 stars for Amazon, I would have done so.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Will not open on my kindle fire. It is as simple as that. It gives an error message and wont open. uninstalled and reinstalled with no success.
0765325950|5.0|While I had minor issues with how some of the characters finished the series, as a whole, I can think of very few ways this book could have been improved. After 22 years and hundreds of characters in 14 books, the task was accomplished as best as can be expected - and it did that job very well.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Who doesn't love a Classic Disney movie?  My Granddaughter absolutely loved it and she is only two years old.  Highly recommend.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|None of my order has been downloaded to my kindle, I have no idea why, but they do not show up on the Apps page.
1567184855|5.0|As I study about our soul, this book was a natural choice.  I have since purchased it as gifts for my daughters.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|[I hadn't seen the movie, yet]<br />I personally loved reading this novel. I loved the fact that it doesn't try to be necessarily touching, but aims to provoke emotions by being accurate and truthful. I appreciated the fact that in more than one occasion, the writer/storyteller/whatever you want to call him admits his impossibility in describing such unbelievable scenes.<br />It is a novel about life, yes. About things we all are supposed to know, even though here are presented through the eyes of a clever mind (IMHO).<br />Eventually, one doesn't really understand how much fiction has been poured into these pages, but to me it didn't matter. Whether it is a fictional work or not, it is worth reading to reevaluate our ideas about relationships, religion, cleverness, and life.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I thought it was insanely funny but the movie is geared more towards guys. Needless to say, my girlfriend did not really like it...
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I read this book in about a week. I found real good and amazing. If you wanna read about strength, will and beliefs you will find it here. Thank you for the story!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Think it was a bit to harsh, to many F-bombs and the bear wasn't really that likable. Probably more appealing to the teen-age crowd.
0897502027|5.0|Mind-blowing, turns out Bruce and I are a lot alike. Life, can be enlightened by this GUIDE. Not the martial arts.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|My children enjoyed this movie.  Their ages range from 5-8 years.  They enjoy The Great Fairy Rescue as well.  We own both movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great! A sexy, emotional roller coaster! Definitely a recommended read if your a sucker for a suspenseful romance.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so much fun!  Warning don't play at night because you\\"ll stay up playing and never get to sleep!  Probably my favorite game on my smartphone
B008BDZOZY|4.0|david byrne is always out there in his compositions, but in a way that's so hard to describe. this album will not disappoint david byrne/talking heads fans and the addition of st. vincent (annie clark) brings a whole new dimension to this recording not to mention the brass band backup that works so well.
B00307OTDE|5.0|This compilation gives a good representation of this pioneer's work.  I never tire of these timeless songs. Great when they were new still spectacular.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|anyone who has worked in corporate America will connect with this movie in the first few minutes. the laughs come constantly, and the stupidity of the corporate mind-set is laid bare. truly a must see for all the frustrated workers who are left scratching their heads over directives coming down with no logic as to what the expected outcomes these directives will achieve.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Trust me, this band and album is amazing, it is a make of some of their older popular songs re-recorded with the label, and a mix of new songs!  This band is very outside the box, and sometimes it takes a couple listens to get use to them.  But once you start to pick up the songs, you fall in love and gotta have more! Tyler and Josh are great men who spend a lot of their free time volunteering their music abilities to church events in their home town.  If you have never seen them live, you need to go to a show ASAP.  But first, get this album and memorize their songs so you can sing along!
B001ER4CSO|5.0|Great movie. It arrived neatly and securely packaged. Its a great movie i would definitely  recommend it to any one.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I purchased this movie for my son, but I enjoyed it very much myself. It is one of those movies where you fall in love with the characters and I am looking forward to the next movie.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved the book because it had so much action in it. it was like I was in the story. if I could give it a 200 star rating I would.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Very enjoyable movie and even though I had seen it before in the theater. I would recommend this movie to my friends.
0312323867|5.0|Great condition. Shipped soon. These book was great I have liked all of her books.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It has a seemingly endless array of puzzles varying in degrees of difficulty as well as design.  Great tile contrast.
141659521X|3.0|Have read all of Flynn's novels and, unfortunately like all other writers who write too much, the writing starts to get more difficult. This book lacked the punch of previous writings. Ending was predictible.
B003AY818Q|5.0|Excellent story line and well written, written in a manner to be interesting all the way thru. Definetly a book not soon forgotten.
B00005NGAK|5.0|Bought this for a family that had never seen a Michael Flatley performance. The family loved it. For myself I think this DVD captures his best performance beautifully. If you like his stly of Irish dancing, you will love this.
0670026603|5.0|I knew i wanted to keep reading immediately. Written with a lovely voice showing the characters as wholly unique in a rare showing of effortless style. Award worthy!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you've seen this, you know.  If you haven't you'd better not start.<br />Best acting, terrific writing, beautifully filmed in the early 1900's, it's the best of British stories.<br />You can't miss this series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it. I was hooked from the first chapter. I can't wait to read Mrs. Hoover's other books. The ending was a total surprise.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I wanted a Grisham book for the easy fiction read - and got it this time again. I had some trouble keeping characters straight early in, but other than that I enjoyed it.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Enjoyed this book. There are many turns and twists, not unusual with Michael Connelly, Bosch continues to be a fun read.
1465001123|4.0|I really liked the fact that Browntrout was quick with getting the calendar to my house but it was bent and not packaged properly. Other than that my brother was happy with the Christmas gift
B0000669JL|1.0|3 songs skip. I shouldn't have to pay for this. i understand its an old CD but I didn't ask for a defective disk.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|At first it seemed like a lot of other games like this one, but this one ends up being quite unique and addicting
B009YU6FJM|5.0|This is truly a wonderful album. I think this is my favorite Deftones release. I love the song &#34;goon squad&#34;. This is just a really great album.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book gives a very detailed view of the culture of Afghanistan while telling a touching story.  Filled with drama and tragedy this was a page turner I couldn't put down!
B009YU62H2|5.0|I am so happy Soundgarden have returned. This is a great album. The songs are great musically and lyrically. I am glad they can still make such great music.
B008220C38|3.0|With Keira in the title role, a wonderful soundtrack, lush photography and choreography, one might think this production could not fail. Yet the \\"stage play\\" effect is disconcerting and the story leaves the viewer with a feeling that something's not quite right here. That said, the romantic scenes make up visually what they lack in warmth, and the audience should get its money's worth. Just don't expect many Oscar nominations for this one...
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Very exciting,fast moving very little bad language I enjoyed reading something that didn't have sex as the main theme.Child is very knowledgable about military police and local auhtorities.enjoyed the book.The Killing Floor is good book to read.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My brother and sister are both watching second season and told me about the series during the holidays.  I am already done with season 1.  Very addicting.  Claire Danes is awesome!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I have wanted this movie on DVD for a long time... and this was the perfect way to buy it plus all the bonus features (the music box, the pictures, the books, the sound track, etc) made it perfect. I love it! Now I can watch this movie no matter what format. I can watch Blu-ray at home... and DVD & a friend's house who might not have a Blu-ray.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This app is just fun. I like to play to occupy my mind, I suffer with chronic pain, it lets me just attempt to concentrate on nothing but the game. The visuals are done well also. Overall I just like it.
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|Beach House has put out some great albums; each successively better than the last. This holds true for &#34;Bloom&#34;. Their latest release is their best to date.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Just discovered Jason and he is from my area.  I will be playing for a while.  This is great.  Hope others like it too.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|The whole movie within itself was phenomonal! Their are so many people in this world that live and think like they do in the movie, what was great about American history x is that, it had a wonderful moral, and it makes you think when is this crazy racism going to stop, seems like never, but its up to each one of us as individuals, and accept the movie and the world for what it is and how we are able to make it a better place, however WE are able to and to act as WE know is the right and correct way and to raise our children to the best of our knowledge, and to live everyday as best as we can and know how.  I definatley recommend this movie to ALL ethnic backrounds!!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Truly from a different era.  An inspiring christian drama set in ancient Rome.  I loved the church history.  My wife loved the romantic stuff.
0783231032|4.0|Great movie but there's not anything special about the Collectors edition version. If you're a fan of comedy, John Belushi, John Candy, Dan Akroid...you'll love it.
0765325950|5.0|No matter how this ended there were bound to be aspects that readers will think could have been or should have been included. That said, it was a very well-crafted finale and when all three of the final books are considered together it is worthy of five star rating.<br /><br />To the people who have given it one star based on the lack of an ebook: I get why you are angry, but when I look at a book review I'm not trying to find out about somebody's satisfaction with the physical form of the product. I don't care if the bindings were messed-up, I don't care if it was inconvenient to purchase. I want to know about the content only. Though I think your complaints are somewhat justified it is wrong to the legacy of the series to rate the actual book based on these legitimate concerns.<br /><br />Product reviews are about quality. When people are going to purchase a printer they want to know how it works. When they purchase a book they want to know how good it is. They don't want to see ratings completely skewed by reviewers complaints about the format it has been delivered in. It's too bad any old review can be published, regardless of its legitimacy (indeed, I only wrote this to complain about ebook complaints, but the score remains valid in my opinion).<br /><br />If you are upset about the lack of an ebook, dont purchase the product. You shouldn't be writing reviews if you haven't actually read the book, just as it would be unfair to write a review of any other product that you haven't used.
0307716988|5.0|Love. The book every body should read the book to get the real michaeljackson this is his real story in his own words
B003R4ZMJU|1.0|This is the first time since I have been an Amazon member, that I have received a bad product. I ordered this season, brand new still in the shrink wrap, for my sister for Christmas and when she began watching it, she found that one of the disks would skip and refused to bring up the menu. She was forced to skip several episodes due to this.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Very good quality, and season 3 of the walking dead has kept me on the edge of my and amazon lets me watch the shows even if I miss them on tv.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all the Mitch Rapp books written by Vince Flynn and am already eager to obtain the next write which most likely will not be for 6 or so months.  The story line, technical details and relevance of the subject focus is right on with my attitude concerning the story events.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I purchased this movie for my granddaughter for Christmas,, and both she and my grandson love it! I would recommend.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Haven't watched yet, but the person I gave it to was most pleased.  Just purchased a new 60&#34; TV and Blue Ray player
B0070YDOT8|4.0|I gave this product a 4 star rating. I find the games very entertaining. However, I have experienced getting booted on occasion; which can be annoying.<br /><br />I would also like to see a better variety of gifts you can send to your playing parterners. For example, a birtheday cake for those you know that having a birthday coming up.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I thought it was very well made and it was a great composer on the true greatness of the violin
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book opened my eyes to different views of the world. Views I was blind to before. It's opened my heart and soul.
1609611543|4.0|Eliminating wheat from my diet had helped improve my health. And I was looking for more information as to exactly why, the &#34;staff of life,&#34;  had led to my unhealthy symptoms. And why was the wheat of my grandma so different to the wheat of today? Wheat Belly answered my questions. And while in some places it was a bit too academic for my taste, it was still an overall interesting read and helped to explain what all the fuss is about.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|A lower budget but better executed adaptation than the 1995 version with Stallone. Karl Urban is very solid in the role of Judge Joe Dredd. Nice cinematography & set direction making for a believable Mega-City One. Olivia Thrilby makes for a good Judge Anderson & Lena Headey makes for a despicable villain. Dredd makes for a good closed quarters action film in the vein of the original Die Hard.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't stop reading.  This is an amzing author.  You can really feel everything and live right there with the characters.<br />It will make you cry.<br /><br />I love the way Jojo Moyes writes.  Very clean, none of the unnecessary smut.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|This movie was a huge disappointment.  Bad writing, acting, directing. The 3 protagonists were not qualified to star in anything other than porn.  I read the book and enjoyed it and thought Oliver Stone would do a good job adapting it to screen.  Boy was I wrong.  Total garbage.  I would recommend this for either people who have no taste or for those who want to have a mystery science theater sort of joke fest.  My gf and I did the latter, which was the only way to make this movie tolerable.  Still, the $3.99 would have been much better spent on lottery tickets.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like playing Solitaire but there are only so many games and after you played for a day you've played them all
1416979174|3.0|It's okay but I feel like the ending is abrupt.  My son wanted me to read it to him twice and that is all so far.  But i know that the Carle stuff is hit or miss on kids and i think my kid is a miss on all of them besides the very hungry caterpillar.
B007THA4FI|2.0|right of the bat, left and right, 4 letter words.  I tried to read past them and tried to get interested but never did.  I may have reads it half way, by force.  Then gave up
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Christian Bale is the best batman I have seen and I have seen them all. There is continuity from one of his movies to the next. Hopefully he will continue making these movies.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Excellent follow-on to the first in the series.  Extremely well acted, action galore with twists and turns, in the spirit of Indiana Jones.  The special effects are spectacular because you hardly notice them as the scenes move swiftly by.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great Book!  Everyone should read it.  Delivery was good.  Anyone in a relationship could benefit from it.  Even families can learn about raising their kids.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|I had read this book before, but in portuguese. I confess that this book surprises me every time I read it!!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This book is LOL funny, sure to be appreciated by any cat owner.  Great gift idea for those with a new kitten.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Best little program to drill down into cell phone and kindle files.  Very easy to use.  I use it on both devices.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Very Happy. My Wife was happy with it. It was what she wanted. She found a couple new songs she liked
0765325950|5.0|This is such a different book from the rest of the series, as so much of it is battle. I thought that this might take away from character development, but I was completely wrong. This was more like watching a movie than reading a book, with the writing taking my imagination to the next level. Truly incredible book, and a shout out to Brandon Sanderson who really knocked it out of the park. He was given an enormous task and really took charge.<br /><br />P.S. Very sad to see a stain on Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson's legacy because the E-readers have to wait. This wasn't the book's fault, so why don't you take your whining elsewhere.
1416549447|5.0|I started jogging through our neighborhood with my wife because she wanted to lose weight.  I'd never run before so we joined a community running club.  I was MISERABLE!  Not only did Texas heat kick my butt, I was in constant pain - hips mostly.  What could have potentially been a good time together improving our health turned into miserable dread.  I felt there MUST be an easier way to run.  I process things logically, so I began scouring the web for answers.  Youtube had fabulous videos produced by ordinary people explaining the ChiRunning method.  I watched the videos and then purchased the book.  This book LITERALLY changed the way I ran and improved my running technique.  Since owning the book, I've run injury free (no more hip issues, etc) and have run 2 half marathons, a 10K and a couple of 5Ks.  If you really want to learn how to run with less physical stress and more pleasure, this book is a must.  Highly recommend it!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Such a good movie.  Brought back my college a cappella days. Hilarious.  Deke Sharon is awesome and so talented. Yay
B008IYR2BA|5.0|My wife and I both love Dexter! For your best value, purchse the whole season! Can't wait until Season 7 is released!!
B00457WZEI|5.0|War Horse is a great book for all ages.Any horse lover will enjoy this read. Although, it is a little sad being that it is about as the name states \\"War Horse\\"
B008Y73QDY|5.0|This is the one thing my 13 year old and my 4 year old can agree on. They love Lilo and Stitch! The quality was great and now I can turn it on for them whenever I need to.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Pretty good boring<br /><br />I'd do three because I can make more to series  pre-release it would make you son.ore moneyy
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Its an awesome game that keeps you busy. Love trying to figure out a good puzzel and the graphics are amazing.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I've been in love with this movie for yrs! So glad my son is too! Beautiful and well done! Great Christmas movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like that I can use this across several different platforms and they all sync without problem. There are probably several other uses but I mainly just use it to sync a few notes or store stuff that I have to copy and paste on my mobile device.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book was far above my expectations. The story line truly pulls the reader into the land where katsa inhabits. Truly original plot, and relatable heroine
B00899DV6O|5.0|bro justin beiber albom is the best. hes like the best mousihon of the dekade. JK it was alright pretty catchy. got for my sister and she likes it so..
B003O86FMW|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST UNEXPECTED BOOK! The story is normal but a HUGE twist at the end o  the book!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I really, really like this game. I like arranging the animals and decorating the village however there are some drawbacks. It is very, very difficult to accumulate acorns. Apparently, that is designed so you will buy acorns with real money. I like the Scrat Karate game where you hit piranhas to get a reward but there is no correlation between how well you do in the game to how big a reward you get. The reward spinner takes forever to settle. Also, how am I supposed to get 500! hearts from liking other villages? The Visit Other Villages keeps freezing up sayin there is a bad connection when the connecton is fine. Fun but don't expect to reach all the goals unless you spend real money on acorns.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I love the game, however the part I don't like is at work I cannot play on my kindle because work doesn't have wifi for employees. The other thing i do not like is that you can get through only so many boards then it wants you to purchase more bubbles, this could get very expensive after awhile ay .99 each time you buy bubbles.<br /><br />On the bright side the game is fun and you have to think two bubbles ahead to make the most of your moves, so it is very stratgic and mind using.
B00457WZEI|4.0|War Horse was very good. I have not read a book based on the animal telling the story&#62; Very interesting perspective.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book definitely made me think. I felt it too. I cried at the sad parts and laughed at the funny parts. Thank God I read this or I wouldn't have read one of the best books in my opinion.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I prefer the feel of leather.  I found this product harsh feeling on my sensitive fingers.  Comfort is the word for me.  This is not comfortable.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|An amazing sequel to beautiful creatures! I would recommend this book to anyone who loved the first book. I wish I could give this book a hundred star rating!
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I use these on the road loaded on my kindle fire.  Perfect for a quick 20 minute workout before starting the workday.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it . It's a good idea to have the game and play the game. It's addictive!<br /><br />GOTTA HAVE GAME
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved this game! It was very interesting and the story line was cool. Can't wait till the second one comes out. Does anyone know when it is?
0792837983|5.0|Movie was a lot more surprising then i had expected. Some parts were very different. Lolita definitely surpassed my expectations and would most definitely watch again. Not to mention it's a Stanley Kubrick classic!
B0086700CM|4.0|Love this game and it works great on my iPad and iPhone 5 and android phone; however it doesn't work on the KINDLE FIRE...you are unable to use the TILT like you can with the other platforms...<br /><br />UPDATE:  Seems that it has been fixed now and does work on the Kindle Fire...
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|If you work with kids, this is an important book.  It covers the topic well and discusses why grit is important, but only hints at practical ways to improve it.  A manual is needed!
B000LB7G00|5.0|This is my 1st foray into a 3d mouse, I use it with Inventor. I find I tend to use this and the normal mouse at the same time. It takes some practice, but I like ti.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Just a great read!!!!I would recommend it over and over...And will be to everyone I know that reads!!!Thanks Darcy for recommending another great book:-)
B0056C6XIA|3.0|The flashlight is the best part of this kit. I would like to be able to easily take this on and off of my belt, but it doesnt work well for me.
B001TODCII|5.0|Non stop action.  Dad goes all out, nothing is going to stop him, to save his daughter.  Very enjoyable movie.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie, special effects are excellent! Recommended for when you are low energy, this will pick you up a lot!
B004EPZ07K|1.0|I thought the critics reviews were probably overly harsh.  I thought it couldn't be *that* bad.  I thought it would be fun.  I was wrong.  It's cheesy and dumb but not in a good way.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I watch this movie every year before Christmas time. It has become a tradition. The stories are so brilliantly written and the casting is fantastic. I notice new nuances and connections each time I watch it. It will make you laugh, cry, and think a little more deeply. I love this movie with all my heart, although I wouldn't recommend watching it with children or your parents. (There are a few scenes of nudity and a bit of language throughout.) This is one to watch with your girlfriends. Great replay value. If you enjoyed movies like Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve, you will love this one. It is the first, the original, and the best. :)
B00A0L7PE8|1.0|He's absolutely stopped trying. The most forgettable single yet. He's now just an oldies act putting out occasional single to feel relevant.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I admire Abe and the depiction of his life as president was a nice twist.<br /><br />Recommend for anyone (PG). It's not scary and done in good taste.
B0041KVV8U|5.0|This 2 Lp set was one of those in my 2012 Big Box Set, shipped for Christmas (my wife got it for me, doesn't get better!), all of which sound amazing, but I picked this one to write about in particular as I have the 80's issue as well, and this is Soooo much better that I'm going to just auction the other off on ebay for whatever I get. The mastering is far superior, batter bass, presence, and my Lp's play whisper quiet just like old school MFSL titles (my whole set is like that).  I think these are true to the original sound, MFSL on the other hand eq'd them quite a bit, and frankly these make even those sound just OK. I think these are better than any other vinyl issues, they sound better than my old school UK issues too (I have em all!), if you love to spin vinyl I think you'll be really happy. I use a high end Denon table, a  Denon 301 II MC and an Ortofon Super OM 30 and 40 MM (this one on my Luxman), 901's (w/ a sub woofer), seperates, 250 per channel (no not peak, continuous via a Carver power amp), so they produce a fairly discriminating sound. When these are good like mine there's just nothing else like them! Defects are known to exist with the early pressings, but not all as evidenced by mine bought within days of initial release. Amazon has been fantastic in atking care of people if there are any issues, so treat yourself. These sound just fantastic. Even to us who are a bit older and remember what the originals sounded like the day we opened them and put them on the console!
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Was par to course for empty nesters. Great account of how to bring the intimacy back to the marriage relationship.<br /><br />Would recommend for all married couples; hopefully inspiration for avoiding this very real potential hiccup.<br /><br />Tommy Lee and Meryl both excellent in their roles.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie was very good. I have never read the comic but I know Dredd.  The 3-d is almost perfect with some minor ghosting during slow mo on a plus 2 depth setting.  After it ends you want a little more another one would be nice but wont happen unless the blu sales extremely well.  So if you like good action then buy this.
0374275637|5.0|In fact I have already listened whole book on CDs (audio book). It is so good that I decided to order one to keep it on my bookshelf as long term reference.<br /><br />I got the book very fast with excellent condition. Thank you.
B004EPYZTE|4.0|This movie was just mindless fun.  I liked the Arnold one but was not in love with it and it was timeto move on.  This was more fun then that one and I must say the Actor was better. Its sad there will be no more and they have gone back to what was oh well.  If you like fun fantasy action movies then try it out.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Never saw this musical. Recently I watched movie and then bought this Blue Ray DVD. I watched it immediately when got it yesterday and feel it is a wonderful masterpiece to keep for whole life. I'm thinking to buy more as gifts to the friends.<br /><br />Delivery is so fast. It only took one day. The DVD quality is very good. Thank you.
B00701L5XS|5.0|As a new leader of the New Scout Patrol, this app is a great way to teach knots.  Another leader even asked what it was.  This app is a required tool for me now, and I have a Silver Beaver and many knot tools.  This is the best.
0399160450|5.0|Not the writer that he was 20 years ago but still better than most. His topics generally precede real life by a few years.... . Scary.
B009MO5960|4.0|this is the best one yet out of all them if you are a fan you will love this move
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read several proof of heaven types of books but this one has so many analytical details that it bogs down the message--although necessary for the scientific community.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|the chick is annoying...It would be a much better story if someone else narrated, but still a decent story though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless review<br />A must read book, I started reading Hopeless because my friends were making a big fuss about the book on Facebook, little did I know, that I was going to be taken into a story so powerful, as always in my mind I was already trying to figure out the plot, but never did I imagine the emotional trip I had embarked on. My emotions raw, my heartbeat gone so strong , Collen Hoover,  had me sitting at the edge of my reading chair, she  really outdid her self with Hopeless. You should see my highlighted places shared on my Facebook, yet I tried really hard not to give away too much, and spoiled for my friends, the big fuss that my friends had made over Hopeless, was NOTHING!!, compared to all my updates. This book just made it to the list of my favorites. I had friends reading it, in London and Canada , Thank you sooo much..Author Collen Hoover one more HIT....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love this game lots of fun to play.  Reminds me of the real coin game I played growing up.  I can play for hours and not get bored.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I was hoping for a quick print  app but this one appears to have a few hoops to jump through to get from here to there.
B0091REZMW|5.0|awesome game to play. its a blast. the graphics are awesome as well. and the quests make for the game to be more interesting. thanks keep it up
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so much like temple run but even better. You can jump over trains, collect coins and much more that you won't believe.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|They really don't hold back in this show. It's the kinda of show you watch repeatedly. It's really not that graphic either, this makes my top 5 TV shows.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Many plots twists and turns in this fictional adventure that is also a cautionary tale in the misapplication of Federal anti-racketeering and the maze of other U. S. laws.  Hard to put down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just can't wait to watch it every week. I have never seen a series like this. I even watch that annoying little guy in the discussion group &#34;talking dead&#34; that comes after the show. This is my favorite of all time series.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I can listen to this forever. There isn't a bad song for miles. I can't wait for more from this amazing songstress.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|At first I thought I bought a porn, however it just a little graphic in that sense. Otherwise, good acting and script.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|My mother's favorite. So glad to be able to watch this with her again. Dumbo is as charming as I remember.
0723257639|2.0|The book is great but one  I thought I'd cancelled  because it just did not suit the child I had planned to give it to.  I haven't returned it yet and must get to it along w/ thr address book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I rarely purchase CD's anymore. Downloads are fine for me. I treasure this one. It will be worn out from replay soon. I can't wait for the next one.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|The words drip off the page!<br /><br />Haven't finished yet but it's very vivid, liking it so far.<br /><br />I'd suggest reading the books to any Dexter fan.
B000086EOE|4.0|I have been a Genesis fan since \\"Selling England\\" was first put out, and Hackett's guitar work has moved me to tears (in the good way) on more than one occasion. So how could I resist this offering?<br /><br />This album has some very different interpretations of some of my favorite music, and on the whole I like the results. After all, if I wanted to hear the originals done by rote I could just cue up \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\", \\"Trick of the Tail\\" etc.<br /><br />The point of an album like this is the re-interpretation, though if you get too far away from the original in the search for, say, the same territory as Joe Cocker walked with \\"First We Take Manhattan\\" you run the risk of ending up in the same place Bono did with \\"Halleluiah\\" (which I don't feel was wrong, just extreme).<br /><br />There are a couple of such moments, mostly evoked with a peculiar bass-grunted vocal technique used in place of a more conventional voicing (Dance on a Volcano is done in part this way). It is disconcerting and some people are going to hate it. I don't.<br /><br />I wish that the vocals had been louder in the mix and more varied in technique - some of the songs recorded with a conventional vocal with reverb (which is overused here IMO) could have been experimented with a bit more aggressively I reckon.<br /><br />Yes, some of my most favorite tracks from the catalog have been less \\"great\\" here than the original (not keen on the arrangement of \\"Fountain of Salmacis\\" myself) but they are all interesting and worth a listen, and I will certainly be listening to them again. And, you know, my opinion of a piece of music has been known to change for the better over a couple of hearings.<br /><br />If you are looking for a faithful rendition of the originals with just a different vocalist, go for \\"Genesis Revisited II\\".<br /><br />I do think that Hackett could have made his own playing more prominent. I like to have headphone sessions where I pick out one instrument in the piece and follow what the player is doing to the partial exclusion of the others. I'd have liked to hear some of the work here as Hackett overtracking Hackett (overtracking Hackett), so I could have my cake and eat it too without all those other musicians cluttering up the soundscape.<br /><br />Anyway, I dropped a star for the combination of lack of vocal experimentation (what is there will be too much for many of course) and not enough Hackett. I still think this was good value for my music dollars.and follow what the player is doing to the partial exclusion of the others.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|I got this for a quick touch up on my cheaper kitchen knives.  I found out pretty quickly that this is a lot more difficult to keep at the correct angles than I imagined it would be.  You have not to only worry about pressure and speed of the knife but also the angle and stability of the sharpener as well.  I probably will not end up using this sharpener any more as it took me as much time as my stones usually do.  What I wanted was something that was quick, but still worked ok.<br /><br />Personally this just did not cut it for me.  The only upside is that it was cheap.<br /><br />3 Stars.
B009439HEY|3.0|A double album of Genesis and Early Hackett material, re-recorded with immaculate attention to detail and perfect technique. If you want to hear your favorite music played to the same arrangement with perhaps some clever work on the intros, this is your album.<br /><br />I find myself at one and the same time delighted with the material and disappointed that the same experimental approach adopted for the first \\"Revisited\\" album wasn't used here. What we get on this album is a sort of \\"Studio Live Album\\" effect.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Everyone playing here is giving 100% and achieving stunning results. I'd have paid to see the concert.<br /><br />But I was looking for something other than a tribute. I was hoping for a true revisitation with Hackett stamping the result as uniquely his, which we don't, for the most part, get on either disc here.<br /><br />Clearly the intent on this album was different to that of the other \\"revisited\\" album. Perhaps the criticism leveled over the approach on the first \\"Revisited\\" album was front and center, perhaps there was always the idea to do this album more faithfully with respect to the original pieces. I dunno.<br /><br />I'll probably draw flak for dropping two stars on the grounds I do, but an Amazon review isn't about some nebulous gold standard, it is about the perceptions of the purchaser. I'm disappointed, and the fact is that while the rendering of \\"Horizons\\" and the guitar/synth duet on \\"Ripples\\" still make me cry at the beauty of the music (true, big girl's blouse that I am), I can cue up the original albums and hear much the same arrangement any time I want to.<br /><br />It was worth my money to hear the work, but I just don't think this album will be replayed on my hi-fi as much as the first \\"Revisited\\" album will be.
B007HO392S|5.0|My son loves Carrie Underwood, and so do I, so this was a no-brainer for his Christmas Stocking. Great CD!!
B00ANAC32U|1.0|I have the directly from Google, and its not even worth the $20 I payed from them. Shame on companies like this trying to rip people off, if you must have the google bumper, it will be in stock again by the end of this month.<br /><br />Stay away from this seller!
B00942S4OY|5.0|My son loves One Direction, we bought this for him for Christmas, good CD, even for adults to listen to :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids play this endlessly. Doesn't seem to have any issues. Fun kid game. Not too violent for youngsters little eyes.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funny movie with some harsh language. yet is it very enjoyable as it peaks to the wild side in all of us. Just take it what it is, plain good old entertainment.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games...like the variety though some are a bit difficult..can't seem to get past that tenth game to open up more
B00APUQT7I|3.0|Great movie for the kids but not for adults anymore... It becomes really boring after 10 minutes yet one still can enjoy the animation.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Casablanca is often on \\"Greatest of All Time\\" lists and deservedly so.<br /><br />As they say, they don't make movies like this anymore. Casablanca, in my humble opinion, is that type of film that filmmakers should use as a template for what to do right.<br /><br />As an overview, the film seems rather simple. A niche plotline cast in an interesting setting. But like any good piece of art, there are levels to be uncovered. Subtle nuances that build a solid foundation for a beautiful story.<br /><br />The characters, acted wonderfully, are interesting in their own right, and each could have their own film about their lives. The location is the perfect catalyst, as is the geopolitical situation in which the characters find themselves. You find your heart broken and then mended more than once. There is, in its way, the perfect dance of melancholy and joy. More, the film knows when to end itself and it does so on the perfect note.<br /><br />The film is timeless, and whatever form you choose to view it, you will not be dissapointed. Treat yourself.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Does not touch the original ones! Special effects are OK but the story get somewhat disconnected form what it wants to be, which is I guess to entertain people. Too complicated to follow and if you want to connect it to the earlier ones with Matt Damon. Worth to watch it though.
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|I have no problem with complexity and rather, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The problem is, the writer's prose needs to match that complexity with clarity.<br /><br />I've tried this book several times now, merely because I'd like to see if it gets better. Finally, I slugged my way through and finished this one. I'm not sure how or even, what I just read.<br /><br />It's like the writer took his D&D campaign notes (supposedly his GURPS game actually), all loosely scribed on scraps of paper and placed in a box, then dumped them out on the table and said \\"Here is my story\\".<br /><br />When you pick up one of those scraps you think \\"Hmm...that looks interesting\\" until you realize it's just one scrap and poorly written at that.  And in reality, even if this were a D&D game and not a book, I'd still be frustrated to be a player in it. It would be one of those games where you ask \\"What exactly are we supposed to be doing right now? Where are we?\\"<br /><br />Even outside of the muddled story, individual sentences alone make little sense. Half the time you are asking \\"What does that have to do with anything?\\". The answer from fans is, \\"Wait until book 47 and in chapter 23 you learn about it\\" and frankly, I don't care to get that far. I've had enough.<br /><br />One has to ask themselves why this was allowed to be published and more, since it was, why an editor didn't work on it with the writer. It would have done him a great service to have had a good one.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Good acting, good chemistry and simple way of saying here we have a story to tell. I enjoyed it very much and would watch it later again (in 2 years...lol)
1582406723|4.0|Let me first say that this is the 12th edition of volume 1 of the series. I would have preferred an earlier printing. With that said, its made with good quality paper and has an almost hard cover. i would not recommend buying this series for young children because it follows adult themes and I dont plan on buying any more because its kind of hard to keep up with it but i definitely wanted to have the first volume at least. I am happy with the purchase but i will be on the look out for an earlier printing, perhaps ill get lucky and find a first edition or something.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I had great expectation for the movie and that was a problem for me. A good movie with a very interesting but crazy idea! THe story unfolds slowly, which keeps you wanting to see more but at the end it is a surprise!

B005UDD1R6|1.0|The app is free... but NONE of it works without a paid-for add-on. If it NEEDS an add-on to work AT ALL, then it's not really free. I hope amazon reads this and pulls the app down for fraudulent price-bating. You cant watch ANYTHING without paying for the additional app.

B005SCSL56|3.0|The Land of Stories by Chris Colfer was an exciting romp through the world of fairy tales.  In a \\"parallel universe\\" that is located through the book The Land of Stories Alex and Conner begin their adventure.  The fairy tale world has continued beyond the Happily Ever After.  The stories did not end there.  Goldilocks is on the run because the bears pressed charges.  Jack has to do constant work to maintain the giant beanstalk in his back yard.<br />Once Alex and Conner are accidentally trapped in this fairy tale world, upon hearing about a legendary Wishing Spell, they embark on a scavenger hunt to get the pieces to construct the spell that will allow them to go home.  Chris Colfer does a good job creating characters that feel real.  In our present time , with Once Upon a Time back on TV, I couldn't help picturing Ginnifer Goodwin as Snow White.  Overall I enjoyed this book almost as much as similar books like Storybound and Perilous Realms.  I would recommend it to fans of fantasy.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Captain America didn't get a whole lotta buzz in my home....until The Avengers came out in 3D.  After that, I was compelled to go back and watch all of the individual Avenger Titles like Hulk, Thor, Iron Man 1 & 2....I really just relaxed and gave into the guilty pleasure of a mindless action flick. Its not as great as the other Avenger characters films, but its still good.  You won't be displeased. I don't have to watch every movie looking for some deeper meaning . . . some movies are just plain fun to watch with friends. So please, pass me the popcorn and the remote - its Movie Night!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book. Might be the best of the trilogy! I hope the movies don't ruin it and it's message :)

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Visually appealing and gives more info on battery life and health than the kindle itself. And it's free which is a great plus!
B0077EBWVI|2.0|I think it hurts Hollywood to give new movies a chance - choosing to stick to formulaic hits that worked in the 80s - and regurgitating them for todays audience.  Why mess with what was perfection?  Not every film needs a \\"remake\\", several\\"sequels\\" or now the addition of \\"prequels\\".  Take a chance on less grand productions and make some of these Indy filmmakers box office gold.  This movie was almost an exact take on the 80s version with none of the real chemistry or acting chops (K. Bacon).  Two thumbs dowm.....and two big toes!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Get this to restore your faith in your self. A favorite of my husband who was thrilled to get it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry, and it made me think. Out of all of Sparks books, I have to say that I really enjoyed this one.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This has you going high and low, but if you stick to it and don't use the hints its a very fun and entertaining game.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|My husband and I watched this on Christmas Eve after all the presents were set up and under the tree.  It is so great- the music is amazing, and the story is just so endearing.  Highly recommend it!
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Got off to a bit of slow start but by the end, you are amazed at the plot. Great story, script and great acting by Edward Norton. It's no more graphic than Criminal Minds or CSI but there are several F-bombs & strong language if that bothers you. If you think you know where the story is going, you might be surprised by the end!
B003UESJH4|5.0|we purchased this dvd and it was exactly what we wanted, not shipped immediately but very quickly and arrived before they said it would
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was lured into Downton Abbey by facebook friends. Even after reading the synopsis, I didn't see the attraction...until I watched the first episode. Then both hubby and I were hooked! Season 3 has not disappointed and we can't wait for the next episode!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I liked this book so much, that when i had finished it, I couldn't read anything else for a week, because I was still thinking of the way everything ended. This is one of those series, that you don't want to end.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Starts a little slow but builds into a compelling and complex story.  I enjoyed the story and highly recommend this book.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|The story is unusual with delightful characters whose outlook on life does not in any way meet the normal standard. Both of the young people live their lives in a manner that  adheres to their own standards. In doing so, they create an atmosphere of good cheer and good sense. The rest of the characters are unable to come to grips with those so far out of the mainstream, and are to be pitied rather than admired. It is a genuine good feeling story.
B006885LZM|5.0|Former Marine here.  This struck such a deep cord with me that I could not watch the whole first episode as it was just so true to the Corps.  In other words, so well done that it made this former grunt burst out in tears.  Absolutely amazing production.  You want to really learn something about the U.S.M.C.?  Watch this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it! I avoided it forever! now I'm addicted! great variety and easy to use. can totally see what the fuss is about.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Bought this as a gift and the person loved it. Great film and great transfer. Will likely purchase a copy for myself in the future.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Americans are notoriously death shy. Count on us to deny that we are mortal at every turn. If there is a Fault in our Stars, it's self-inflicted...at least in part. Fate cracks our star the rest of the way.<br /><br />Green's novel unveils death in an especially potent way. Terminal illness, cancer, strikes teenager characters whose lives ought to be ahead of them...that is, if all were right with the stars ...which it never is on only planet on I know of firsthand.<br /><br />His  characters clash with fate and that makes them multi-dimensional. Each of them looks death in the face courageously; even with considerable humor, which keeps the book from falling into pity or the maudlin, always a potential pitfall with this subject matter.<br /><br />Green's skillful balance - wit amid crisis - is why the victims of The Fault Our Stars capture our hearts. When did kids get so with it? Clearly the age of Leave it to Beaver rocketed into something way more nuanced. Skillful dialogue creates believable people. They face mortality's predicament with lots of heart of their own and give readers a bit of wisdom on what it takes to process their ordeal.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars takes us where we need to go, on a well-crafted journey that's no holiday, but The Fault in the Stars is worth the read.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The author pulls you in and makes this book impossible to put down.  Where most books are predictable, this one was anything but!  You meet Sky, who has a strong personality even after being so sheltered most of her life.  Six, the neighbor/best friend who seems to keep Sky grounded in the current world around her... and then Holder, the bad boy who seems to have a lot of secrets. And you will love Breckin!<br />Sky decides to go to public school for her senior year.  She is without her best friend, Six, who is on a foreign exchange trip.  Enter Breckin, who becomes Sky's new best friend at school.  We then meet Holder, who seems a little scary with his bad boy reputation and temper but is so intent on protecting Sky.  I cannot go into any more without revealing the story but this is one book you don't wanna miss.<br />I have read over 70 books in the last year and must say this is one of my favorites hands down!!!!  Love the unpredictable story line of love and hate!  Needed the tissues a few times during this book but could not put it down!!!!!

B0053O89IS|5.0|I bought this for my grandaughter & we both just love this show - I can't wait until she lets me watch this CD.
B000OVLBHG|2.0|This film had Alien Insects that were a joy to watch, that was the only reason to watch this.<br /><br />The Bugs were a highly organized fighting force.<br />The Brain Bug was a Leader, the Main Bugs were Soldiers, the Flying Bugs were an Air-Force, the Plasma Shooters were Anti-Air Craft weapons, the Fire Breathers were armored and massive - living tanks.<br /><br />The human military and soldiers, however, were completely preposterous.<br /><br />The military had space ships and stations, yet soldiers still fought with weapons and body armor no more advanced than it has now - hard to believe. In battle soldiers marched without aid from land vehicles, or air cover?  The military had ships in orbit of planets, and it never thought to bombardment the bugs from orbit?<br /><br />Beyond the absurd military tactics, this also had ridiculous military training. This has a coed military - a coed infantry, where male and female cadets are given the same physical training. These cadets were right out of high school, and this had Coed showers where they didn't even notice or care that they were naked with members of the opposite sex - Yeah Right!<br /><br />The bugs were a joy to watch.  However this movie's vision of the future was one of the worst I have ever seen.  Special effects 5 stars, military 0, so the movie is 2.

B007V5CF5K|2.0|Seems like an alright game, but it keeps exiting and making me have to redo some steps each time. Gets annoying after a while. Not something i would purchase again.
B005LAII80|5.0|I really like this movie. It's priced very reasonable. The acting was good with a good story line. The set had a slight Blade Runner edge, which I liked. Is this better  than the original? I liked them both. They are different movies with the same name. Dredd 3 will be out next year I hope. This movie has taken some heat from the public, but I do not understand why. It cost $36 million to produce it with a small budget for promotion. Movies today are 50% movie and 50% promotion. The Resident Evil Retribution movie is doing well because it had lots of promotion, even though it was a terrible movie all around.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best thrillers I have read. High suspension, good description of characters and good humour, too! The plot is brilliant.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I am a fan of Tom Clancy and I love most of his books. In this book the suspension was there, but I found the story a bit unrealistic.
030758836X|1.0|There were maybe two times while reading this book that I thought things were beginning to happen..but that did not last more than a few paragraphs.  The story is ridiculous, the writing is elementary (except when she intrusively adds all the cuss words). Seriously, this is one of the worst books I have ever read.  Stupid, stupid implausible story line.  I even hated that she gave the name GO to Margo instead of calling her Margo.  Total waste of time and money! I finished the book yesterday and am still upset that I ever read it!!

B000YGIIPO|5.0|Although &#34;The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents&#34; is listed as 'Young Adult', there is no reason why anyone who loves the Discworld series shouldn't enjoy this book, just as there would be no reason for an adult not to read the &#34;Wee Free Men&#34; series. There are references to literature, politics, human nature, that a young adult would have to be extremely well read to understand, (I'm not sure I understood all of them) and these, like all of Sir Terry's books, combine with his perfectly easily readable style, to make &#34;The Amazing Maurice&#34; simply a treat to read. For American readers, 'Maurice' reads like 'Morris'. As always, the book is a morality tale (tail!), perhaps less disguised than usual for a Pratchett novel; ah! is this where the 'young adult' classification has it's roots? But the morality is not what you think, it never is with Sir Terry. I came to this book late in life as a Pratchett reader, having read nearly everything he had written (2012). I was not disappointed, rather, I was happy to be reminded how wonderful Terry Pratchett's earlier works were.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love these books...I just can't get enough.  It's not all about the sex, it's also the drama...and unexpected surprises...love it!

One (Winamp) was good enough, while doubleTwist had serious issues that led me to uninstall and look for other solutions.<br /><br />The turn to Amazon MP3 came when Amazon added its \\"AutoRip\\" service to user accounts. In short: if you were already using Amazon's cloud player (I was), they added the tracks from any CDs purchased from Amazon (since 1998) to your cloud player list. Since I had already made an \\"Amazon over iTunes store\\" decsion earlier, this became an ideal solution for me. Essentially, all music I've ever purchased from Amazon is available in cloud streaming and .mp3 formats (and presumably I still have the physical media from CD purchases, which are not so frequent in my house these days).<br /><br />As for the player itself: it quickly indexed the .mp3 contents of my phone and flawlessly accesses my cloud content (network connections permitting). It automatically switches between Bluetooth and headphones, depending on the what I'm playing the music to. The interface is uncluttered and intuitive. Once you've made the decision to turn control of your music inventory over to Amazon...the rest is easy!last song) via an external trasnmitter (such as the [[ASIN:B008UV6YRO Incredisonic IFM-500]]). Hardly a show stopper...at most an inconvenience.
0812973992|5.0|This book follows multiple characters in multiple places, but then it ties them all together at the end. It is delightful and deep at the same time and centers around the true events of the day in 1974 when Phillipe Petit did an unauthorized wire walk between the Twin Towers. I believe Colum McCann is attempting to show how each of us walks our own death defying tightrope every day.  We may walk it alone and without fanfare, but it is just as frightening and ultimately exhilarating as Petit's walk.  To quote McCann- &#34;I sit here thinking about how much courage it takes to live an ordinary life.&#34;  We do not all have to perform grand, exciting public feats to be heroes.  There are millions of heroes living ordinary lives.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|And season one was amazing..  I'm not giving anything away, so you'll just have to watch it.  Sorry.. you'll thank me later.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I have read many WWII books but would rate this as one of the best. I loved the ending, very touching.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|great movie!!!! the movie was recommended by a friend and i could not find it at any local stores. i would recommend this movie!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was simply amazing. I blew through it and wanted to read it again. I loved the characters and the story.  I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just say I didn't want this book to end.  I hope there's a sequel.  This prompted me to download both of her other books.  Colleen Hoover is my new favorite..I can't wait for her next book!!
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Really enjoyed the way this book was written, have read it three times and each time I get totally sucked into the book again and have to read it to the end. Felt every heartbreak and every declaration from Travis. Loved it.  Can't wait to read Walking Disaster.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|My six-year old loved LEGOS and superheroes, so this kit was a definite hit.  The step-by-step directions that Lego provides allowed him to build the bike by himself, and the actual &#34;hero&#34; pieces have fit with some of the other non-Lego action figures in our house.
1616960922|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is one of the most inventive science fiction writers. His worlds evoke mystery and magic that take the reader into daydreams of \\"what if\\" and encourage engagement with the characters that have depth and beauty. In this book, The Emperor's Soul, I was highly impressed with the breadth of story development for it being a shorter story. Many of his other books are over 500 pages, so this sweeping story left me both enthralled and wishing for more.
0793535093|5.0|Not much to say it's the Allman Brothers Band. Transcribed well and easy to read. Get all three books you won't regret having them.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It is an addicting game that is only good for people that like a challenge. If you don't like a challenge then it is not for you.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This movie was excellent. The concept that our lives move in a loop is a very interesting concept, and then add time travel and meet up with ourselves and try to change our outcome.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I especially liked the fact that there was a character in the book with the same last name as mine.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Gave it to my son for Christmas.  We loved the first two movies and have yet to see the third movie.  Can't wait!
B007HACDLK|5.0|He does not disappoint!  Any fan of international thrillers will no be able to put this one down!<br /><br />The Last Man is excellent!
B000091NP5|5.0|We received our record as expected. The quality was great, still in the sleeve. We really love it. Thank you!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I got so caught up in this movie when my girls were watching it. I can't wait to see the next one!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Kindle fire doesn't have a browser for folders. With this app you can search for everything inside the kindle. It has filters and other cool stuff. Easy to use.
B004XQO90O|4.0|Family voted to add this to our DVD collection, and are very happy with it. Great for family movie night.
B000NTPDSW|2.0|Got this to see if it stood the test of time.  Really enjoyed these when the first came out many years ago but found them to be dated and did not watch the remainder after shutting the first movie down half way through.  The sound quality was also pretty poor.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all 13 in the Mitch Rapp series.  It is difficult to put the book down, and I very, very rarely say that.  I just recommended the series to a friend.  I can't wait for the next book.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Enjoyed this movie and so did my wife.  She had read the book which I had not.  I would recommend this.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|A good story, a reminder of living your intentions.  Colorful characters.  This story may help us all remember why we love the celebration of the Christmas season.
B004EPYZV2|2.0|I have enjoyed the other MI movies but this one relies too much on special effects while the story takes a back seat.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It doesn't seem to work all the time.  It doesn't update your page.  Gets stuck on one date & an error message comes up.
B007JMW46U|3.0|This book seems like it would be great for a smaller child to read. It shortens the stories a lot and changes the dialogue to make it easier to understand. However, when I bought this I was under the impression that it would be the full story, not just summaries.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A fun game without having to put very much thought into it.  Who doesn't like Angry Birds?  It's a good game to just relax & play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it is such a mystery and a fight at the same time I just love you can get scared and be surprised.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|It's almost like playing real pinball.  A little tricky to get the paddles to work the way you want them at first.  With a some pratice you'll get it.  Has more than 1 playing field.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I love this series and was pleased with the final blu-ray. Good quality and I can watch it again and again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a good solitare game.  I don't know what more to say. To me solitare is well...solitare.  It doesn't have any faults.  If you like soliltare, you'll probably like it.
B008ZENVNG|5.0|I am a huge fan of this series! I loved all of the special features and bonus footage. Can't wait for the next one!
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|I've got nearly all of the creator series (with the exception of the first two) and I really like them! I gave it 3 stars in the durable section because, although you can take it all apart and rebuild it again various times, I find the rebuilding something this big (2500+ pieces) can be tedious.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I didnt realize alot of the songs that I like were Adele.  Now I know and I am so glad that I purchased this CD (Download).
B004I9CXHW|2.0|When I plug the phone in my Tiguan using this cable the only thing I can do is charge the phone... Well at least it works as a charger!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Pitch Perfect -<br />Liked the music a lot.  Pitch Perfect was entertaining because of the music and dancing. I would watch it again.
B004CURZFC|5.0|This movie was amazing! My kids loved it! Even my 2 yr old sat and watched it. The story line kept everyone's attention throughout the whole movie. Three young owls hear stories of the guardians from their father and eventually have to go find these guardians, not knowing if they are &#34;real&#34; not. Excellent movie that i highly recommend for a family movie night!
0765325950|1.0|I am joining in on this hoping other people learn from this that delaying the ebook especial by such a long time can only hurt sales already hundreds of people are pirating unofficial versions that are not going to be top quality when you could have many of those people buying your book. 4 months is to long to wait especially if you can pirate it day one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Reminds me of similar games I played when I was younger. Just wish we got more then 40 coins at a time...
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Good music .Helps me with my day and at night before I go to bed. This is a good app to use during the day or night.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Our young grandson loves this game!  He has the Angry Bird stuffed toys, and knows all about the video game.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love holiday music of all kinds (ok, not jazz). And as tiring as the traditional tunes can get, I still love them. Rod's Christmas album really surprised me, in a good way. I am a big fan, but you just never know what to expect when someone puts out a holiday CD. I love Neil Diamond; hated his holiday recordings. Love Carly Simon; was not impressed with her holiday stuff. But Rod's CD kicked it up a notch. This mix provides a great variety of old and new tunes and pairs him with some great artists.<br /><br />The true test was my teenagers. I drive them nuts because I play Christmas music starting the day after Thanksgiving. Despite the fact that I play ALL KINDS of it, they hate it (or at least, they make a big deal of complaining about it). But when they heard this album, they all asked who it was and said it &#34;didn't suck.&#34; If you have teens, you know that's a huge compliment!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This one had great plot depth and some surprising twists. Although some elements where a little illogical like an inescapable prison in a pit... They'd just dig steps or a secret tunnel, that's how Petra was built
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Kept me interested through the whole book which is tough to.  I still don't know who he was writing too!!
B0009UC7H0|5.0|again, I have seen this movie many times a decided to buy it so I can watch it anytime I want.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is just great.  Close it and the Kindle turns off. The strap to keep it close was a surprise when I got it yet it's one of the best features on it. I recommend it to all Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; owners. The price was good too.
B009H442DG|5.0|We are very happy with this CD. IT is nice to hear these two people sing together again.We love them.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is an easy weather app to use, everything seems intuitive. The weekly weather could use some more detail. Overall very handy without too much advertising.
0307895475|4.0|This book is huge, but so is the game. Given its size, I really don't understand why they used a such a small font size for the index, which you need frequently since the game is non-linear. There are 853 pages of text and only 10 pages of index, which has thousands of keywords. It is too small to read in a darkened room. Despite its size, I found that I still needed to use Google occasionally to help with details about game mechanics and play.<br /><br />This guide has very helpful walkthroughs of the main quests, and brief coverage of radiant quests. There are no &#34;cheats&#34; included, which I don't mind.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this. It gives me everthing I need to know about mynlocal weather instantly whereever I am. Would recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This novel or 5 short books are an incredibly addictive read. I was glad I had bought the first one for my Kindle. Since I finished it and immediately ordered the Omnibus, downloaded it and started reading the second book. After two long nights in a row I had finished off the 5 books. Sadly, there is not yet a sequel to the series.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|I don't like it because I can't figure out how to use it.  It is too difficult so I would not recommend it.
034580404X|5.0|This was  a page turner at times, I had to put the book down and walk away.  Very good. Stirred up my imagination.
B000059HAI|5.0|I'm a huge fan of war movies. They give you a perspective of what military personnel go thru during wars.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This new Pac Man game is sure fun, but gives me carpal tunnel issues if I play more than a few games.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was very enjoyable with tons of twists and turns. I loved the very clever plotting, terrific writing, and sustained suspense. This is the best novel I've read in years.
B005KELW26|1.0|This did not even fit my Kindle  Too small overall.....Not for Kindle fire. Company needs to make sure measurements of Kindle r accurate.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was definitely a 5 star book for me. I got so totally wrapped up in the story of Sky and Holder. And I didn't see what was coming up in the story line. It caught me a little off guard and pulled me in even deeper! Sky is a brave, courageous girl and Holder is a passionate, compassionate boy. The love they share is truly amazing. Thank you Colleen for writing such a powerful book!
B009VLX8FS|5.0|l love her music so good to here her cd.. i have all of them nice addition to my collection
B007QUUJMG|4.0|I did enjoy this book, but I don't really get it. It didn't seem to have an real meaning to it, and it was all a bit random. I enjoyed it though and I would recommend in to teens.
B0091QS88K|4.0|nice to have a good app that is free and entertains the kids pretty good thanks for the good one
B005F8CL1S|5.0|You can't beat Leonard Cohen for songwriting and soulful performance. He's never been an opera singer, but the man can write a tune.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|when you need to pump up the music and go to the gym with very good music...time flies by you
1846556007|5.0|The Bat is written in true Jo Nesbo style.  The book has much intrigue and you must read all the book before you really find out the plot.  There are many diverging plots before you finally find out the whole story.  I would recommend all the Jo Nesbo books  dealing with  Harry Hole series.
B008G12ERC|1.0|Wow.  First I must say that Muse has been my favorite band for years. Absolution is possibly the greatest album ever written.  Which makes it all the more difficult to discuss this album without sobbing uncontrollably.<br /><br />The saddest part was that all of the songs COULD have been good (well, most of the songs), but they found a way to ruin each one. I understand that Muse is always pushing themselves and exploring new territory, but seriously guys, play your damn instruments.  Muse was a pillar of hope in a world of crappy synthesized music.  They had the potential to make people wake up and say \\"Oh yeah, real instruments sound way better!\\"  That's all gone now.<br /><br />The main problem is one that started on The Resistance.  The songs keep building and building, and then instead of reaching some sort of meaningful climax, they just peter out.  If I wanted blue balls I'd go to a strip club.<br /><br />Alright, enough venting, let's get down to some details:<br />1. Supremacy: Music starts off promising, and then falls into a ballad with the Bond theme playing secretly beneath it.  They think the song is cohesive because it returns to the musical theme of the beginning for 7 seconds in the middle of the song, and returns to at it the end before tapering off meaninglessly like every song on this album.<br />2. Madness: Ballad (1 of 6) Everyone's already heard this song.  It pains me to say it's one of the best songs on the album.  There are no real instruments, no musical depth to speak of.  Sure, it's a nice melody, and sung with more conviction than any other track, but it's not enough.  Also includes the corniest guitar solo ever written.<br />3. Panic Station: Personally, my favorite song on the album.  I would give it a 3 out of 5, but he counts to 9 in the lyrics.  Like \\"1,2,3,4,5...5,6,7,8,9\\"  Really.  Matthew Bellamy does this.  Multiple times.  Therefore, 1 out of 5.  This is unforgivable.<br />4. Prelude: Maybe this is the best song on the album.It's concise, cohesive, and builds to a productive ending.  Yes, it is a silly violin prelude.<br />5. Survival: \\"I'm gonna win!\\" the lyricist of the year award.  Belongs in a musical, an awful, awful musical.<br />6. Follow Me: Ballad (2 of 6), more cohesive than most of the tracks.  Think Invincible, if it stepped in dog crap.<br />7. Animals: Balladish (3 of 6) Sounds like Santana.  Bored to tears.  Nice bridge in it though.<br />8. Explorers: Ballad (4 of 6) Sounds like a Disney lullaby, complete with sleigh bells, and the listener being \\"Shhh\\"ed to sleep at the end.  Too bad I already was.<br />9. Big Freeze: Ballad (5 of 6)  I hope you like U2.  The song builds and builds and then tapers off meaninglessly. Sound familiar?<br />10. Save Me: Ballad (6 of 6) After Big Freeze lulls you into a chill, some saving would be nice.  Instead we get the next ballad, this one sung by the bassist.  He has an okay voice, but he's no lead vocalist.  Also, the song is awful.  Just awful.<br />11. Liquid State: Sounds like a weak Queens of the Stone Age.  Could be really good, maybe if Bellamy sang instead of Chris.  His voice is lost in the guitars.  Yes! Actual guitars! Thanks Muse!  The song builds to a driving beat and good melody, but just as you finally start to smile in relief, the song ends abruptly. Thanks Muse!<br />12. Unsustainable: Muse really pushed themselves here and included samples of news reports.  I haven't heard ANY band do that before, not EVER!  And I get that they went and saw Skrillex and had a good time, but c'mon.  I enjoyed watching Michael Jordan play basketball, but I know enough to stick with NBA Jam.  I guess Bellamy over-exerted himself writing the lyrics to Survival, so he couldn't come up with anything for this one.<br />13. Isolated System: They were so thrilled with their new idea of sampling news reports, they decided to do it again!  The same ones even!  Also, there's a piano.  This isn't the first time there was piano, but this is the first time I've felt the urge to mention it.<br /><br />That's all I have to say about that.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am only two days in, so I can't accurately rate the results after 30 days yet, but this workout is fantastic.  It is HARD.  It's the hardest 20 minutes that I can remember ever working out.  I had a baby 4 months ago and have a lot of baby weight to lose.  This video is great.  Because it's only 20 minutes, I can wait until I put my baby to sleep at 8, and do this quick workout.  I don't have to miss any time with him by going to the gym.  After day 2, my arms, legs and \\"abs\\" hurt so bad - which is especially nice to feel this burn in my stomach where I need the most help.<br /><br />I know a few other new moms that do this video and they say this was the only thing that helped with the baby belly.  This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review on Amazon.<br /><br />This is perfect for any moms of small children who don't have time to go to the gym, or anyone who is under time constraints of any kind.<br /><br />I should also mention that I am obviously only doing the beginner workout right now, and I can barely get through that.  I can only imagine how challenging the other two workouts are.  I am coming from pregnancy and being completely sedentary, but back in the day I used to workout a LOT, so I do think I know a good workout when I see one.<br /><br />I definitely recommend giving this a try.  I will try to remember to update my review after I complete the 30 days.<br /><br />I will say, the commentary at the beginning and the fact that you can't fast forward through it, is annoying as some other reviewers said.  My solution - turn on the DVD and hit play, then go get \\"ready\\" (fill up water, change clothes, put baby to bed).  By the time you come back, the commentary is over & you're ready to go.  Annoying yes, dealbreaker, absolutely not.
0545101417|5.0|this was a good book. . . It was almost like watching a movie in your head. I have to read the third one now!
B005Z271Y6|4.0|I can watch or even just listen to this over and over. I was surprised with some of the foul language she uses though.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Dang, she ROCKS!! Can't explain what this girl is capable of in words. a must have for anyone who is even thinking of buying!! enjoy.... :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great great great great grate!  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Reallyawesome
0307742997|5.0|A thrilling and exciting read - not Tolstoy but the advantage is one can read in bed and not fall asleep.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A poignant book with life's ups and downs viewed through the eyes of a dog.  Auto racing analogy throughout adds another special dimension.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love Adele's music so I wanted this CD.  I run an older stereo system with a CD player at our cabin so this CD is going there.  21 Adele has 3-4 of her most popular hits but some very nice less popular songs as well.  This is a good product and I got great service.  Thank you Amazon.com.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|I owned a pair of AKG 240s Headphones back in 2003-2008 and remember loving their comfort and open and clean sound... however, one earphones started to short out after tremendous abuse, and I ended up breaking them to the point of garbage trying to fix them myself (lesson learned).<br /><br />Anyways, I needed a more durable and \\"isolated\\" pair of headphones for the next few years while travelling and I got the Audio Technica MTH-50s and love them as well.  I still have them working great at 4 years old.<br /><br />Here come the \\"new\\" AKG 240s.  I was looking forward to that comfort and smoothness of sound.  I plugged them in and things feel great, but sound \\"harsh\\" in the mid-high frequencies.  Not at all as I \\"remember\\" them.  Maybe I have too accustomed to my MTH-50s, but there seems to be a very metallic sound in these new AKG 240s.<br /><br />I do not know if this newly perceived \\"harshness\\" is due to them now being manufactured in China, but they just do not sound as \\"pure\\" as I remember.<br /><br />Lets see if I can break them in for a few days.
0385738781|5.0|Just when you thought things could not possibly get worse, they do.  Thomas and the gang find themselves in even more unexpected predicaments and some of the twists and turns in this final volume of the series will leave you gasping for breath and hanging on the edge of your seat wondering how in the world the author came up with these things.  I spent several moments wondering what kind of sick and twisted mind could come up with these ideas and concepts.<br /><br />Once again, Mr. Dashner's writing style and character development are top notch, leaving you wondering what could possibly go wrong next.  There were many, many head shaker moments in this novel.  My main regret at the end was that I had no way of finding out what was going to come next.  There is the prequel, which I am already immersed in, but it just will not be the same not knowing what will come next.<br /><br />I find myself invested in the characters and as if I had endured the Maze with them, along with the many other trials and tribulations they had to face.  The scariest part of this book is that I can completely and totally imagine the world ending up like that and all of the nightmares it would bring.  I can picture people being under the influence of the Flare and what all that would entail.  It was scary and enlightening all at the same time.<br /><br />So, will civilization survive?  Will this be the end as we know it or will they be able to move on?  You will have to read on to find out.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I will recommend this author and book. I read it at once. I did not want to miss anything. Great find!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movie has made the rounds in my family and we all found it entertaining. I love Robert Downey Jr.
B007SGM084|5.0|One of the best I've ever read! It had everything. There was all the sex, of course, but it also had romance, suspense, comedy,mystery,  etc., and a wonderful story line which surprised me. I laughed & cried! Also, I don't think I've ever blushed while reading novels before. Lol!!!!  I'm not even \\"into\\" these types of story's but I could not put this down! Loved it!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|As improbable the plot, &#34;The Killing Floor&#34; invites the reader to suspend all sense of disbelieve.<br />Sit back and enjoy the story.
1595825045|5.0|My daughter loves Avatar and art.  Perfect gift for any fan of one or both of these subjects.  Great quality.  Insights and art from the Avatar creators are very interesting.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Yes folks, THIS IS THE REAL GENESIS! I'm sorry that I don't like the later lineup when Peter Gabriel left and it basically became the PHIL COLLINS I\\"M RUNNING ON THE GENESIS NAME BAND!!!!!!!!!!  When you listen to the tracks on these albums you can hear the intelligent musicianship all the way through. Have I got the later stuff? Yes but sometimes I ask myself why!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I absolutely love this product.  It is soo much fun I forget to cook dinner!!!  Still trying to complete all levels.
0765325950|5.0|Rate the book on its content, not a decision of the publisher.  Do you judge movies as terrible because they come out in theaters months before being available on DVD/Bluray/online?  Of course not.  Quit your whining.<br /><br />Sanderson's WoT books I've definitely enjoyed, distinct from Jordan's but familiar enough to fit in nicely in the series.  And while many credit Sanderson with being more willing to wrap things up, I can't help but wonder how much of that is Sanderson and how much merely by necessity of the series coming to an end.<br /><br />Regardless, definitely a solid conclusion to one of the more influential series in the fantasy genre.  A few twists I didn't see coming, and a few that we all sort of expected keeps me staying up late at night to read an extra few pages.  And again, as the series comes to a close, and the individual plot lines finally converge, a lot of the frustration of skipping around from one storyline to another right when things get exciting is minimized.<br /><br />Honestly though, who cares about the reviews for this book?  Anyone interested in picking up WoT if they haven't before will start at the beginning.  And anyone that's made it this far will be picking up A Memory of Light regardless of how many inappropriate 1-star reviews the entitlement crowd gives--they're already too far invested.
0761169431|5.0|I saw this at the Star Wars Celebration, however did not want to pay the price they had at the convention.  This is super cute, and was a great present for a friend.  Be warned the Princess Leia paper is a bit creepy.
B001EC3JME|2.0|I have a Fenix PD-32, which comes with its own holster.  However, it is one of those which require you to pass your belt through the holster so you cannot just clip it on and off whenever you wish.  So, I wanted to get one which I could put on without removing my belt!  This one looked good.  However, when I tried to put my flashlight in it, it was nearly impossible.  The holster is really stiff and the elastic is really tight.  Once I did get it in the holster, it was really, really hard to get out.<br />My flashlight is not a really big flashlight, but it's such a tight fit that this holster is basically useless to me.<br />On the plus side, the holster does seem sturdy, so if your flashlight will slide in and out, it should last.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive. Good game to work on timing and hand-eye cordination. Fun game for the whole family.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 has more action and suspense. That lead to more zombie killing and blood. 5 stars we loved it.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|It is awesome as always. You can't go wrong with it. Parts made today fit with the Lego I bought 40 years ago.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I laughed until my sides hurt. The cast is great. Sandra and Ryan make a great pair. Let's see more of them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is hands down the best of the series-especially for those who love the story as much (or more) than the sex.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its so freaking awesome I just love it. it is so addicting. I cant help but be addicted to this game..
1419701533|5.0|My. Girl loves it she read it everyday night and days. She try me crazy with these books but must of all I love her.
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|As a school counselor, I have worked with many families in many languages. Most people want to help their children have a strong mother language but for many families they have several to choose from and it is hard to focus on what they can do for their own children.  It is so nice to get a book that has helpful suggestions that any family can apply. The activities will keep most children interested and understanding what to do is wonderful for parents.  I would highly recommend all international schools to maintain copies to help and support their families.
0345536886|5.0|Arrived sooner than promised.  The book is in excellent shape.  I would definitly use this service again without any hesitation.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I am very happy with this book, great story, of course in Steven King fashion. Story kept me interested and needing to read more. King has that ability to grab your attention and makes you care about the people in the story. I recommend this book to any Steven King fan, and even if you are not a fan or never read King, I would say read this book, you wont be sorry.
B0041D843M|2.0|Seems so convincing, but looking deeper I realize there are too many holes, incomplete info, assumptions,...look up the science reviews yourself, there is plenty of it out there.
B004EJTGTY|5.0|Had this movie forever on dvd, we figured it was time to upgrade to blu ray viewing and glad we did, you cant beat the quality of blu ray for picture and sound. Best Austin powers movie made. If you haven't seen it, definitely need to watch it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|So many details, at times I found it hard to read, but in the end it was all worth it.<br />I saw the movie too, it has spectacular photography, and follows story start and end, but the middle is condensed.<br />I recommend both the book and the movie.
B000L212HW|5.0|We had this movie on DVD , figured it was time to buy on blu ray, happy we did. Blu ray is the best format for action movies hands down.
B008G59IBI|5.0|This is my favorite album of the Uno-Dos-Tre series.  It's a very good &#34;listening&#34; album with a good variety of melodic tunes and good balance from top to bottom, including the use of profanity.  It's great for music lovers and enthusiasts.  &#34;Tre&#34; provides an easy landing after &#34;Dos&#34;.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Classic, that's all I got to say.  Uhmm, if you havn't seen this movie, you need to watch it.<br /><br />&#34; I don't KNOW, Margo!&#34;
B0011UBDTK|3.0|I haven't viewed the whole series, however, so far, Season Two, Disc One is just a bundle of squares/blocks of color/jagged images.  Same with Season Three, Disc Three.  I love SATC TV series and movies so glad to at least have the discs and movies to view when I want but obviously disappointed with these two unviewable (if that's a word) discs.  Haven't had time to view the remaining discs and the movies but hoping they're ok.  Packaging is 'fabulous'!
0446554995|3.0|These are great beach or airplane books, well written for the genre, but Pendergast is beginning to exceed all plausibility with his near-death escapes, encyclopedic knowledge, lack of accountability in the FBI, and family secrets. You get to a point where you say, &#34;Okay, what's the next near-death trap, and how does he miraculously escape?&#34; And the ending is weak and predictable. This is a far cry from &#34;The Relic&#34; and that level of quality.
B000XUBFE2|1.0|I did not like this book. It was hard t o follow.i am a fast reader and I had a hart time with this book
B005LAII1C|5.0|This product arrived on time and in excellent shape, which was good, since the item was a gift. With one exception, I've always had great results when ordering DVD's.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I loved this book very different and very exciting it was a mystery right up to the end.very well written
0060775858|5.0|I was hanging around with my 2 yr son and he found it at the shelves in one store. Since he wanted all the books he liked at that time, I took only 2 among the huge pile he fond of. Sadly, one day after he told me he wanted &#34;Goodnight Moon&#34; (Buenas noches luna, he said). Now you guess why I bought it and I can say he enjoys it every night.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Need i say more?!? Especially for Walking Dead fans this show was AWESOME.. this season kept me on my toes and quite frankly left me upset towards the conclusion, but in a good way lol cant wait until season 4
0307463745|5.0|Only for those who understand that more is not always more, and that less is sometimes more.<br /><br />A very light and deep read!
B00785P2QC|4.0|game is fun but the screen gets cluttered easily<br />if you wish you had more room to play around in the original you will probably like this.
B0015DROBO|3.0|It book is good but why did it take the world by storm?  I found it a little bland and confusing.  With like 20 suspects with similar names you need to take notes to keep them straight.  I am happy I read it but I don't thing I will read any the next one.
B004IM14RY|2.0|This film is way too long for the story it tries to present.  Also, it was extremely dark in nature and the audio was UP/down making it quite hard to enjoy.
B005KELW26|5.0|It's my color (purple). It protects my Kindle Fire from accidental crumbs, etc.,  and it cushions it if dropped (which I've only done on a carpeted floor). I would highly recommend one of these covers to anyone wishing to protect their Kindle Fire. And it looks great, too!<br />JN
B00821OX98|5.0|We are hooked and cannot wait until the 3rd season is available.  We even have our teenage daughter hooked with us!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock is very good! It has lots of things you can set so you will wake up... It also can be used as a timer which I found useful.. Highly reccomend this app for an alarm clock and timer
0399160450|4.0|Purchased for my fiance and he loves it. He is a huge Tom Clancy fan and was looking forward to this book for months.
B005HSL626|3.0|Fun for the first two minutes. Maybe I'm in the wrong age bracket to get it. Just not my idea of fun.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|This book is great an awesome book to enjoy with your children and others. I would tell anyone with or without children to read this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it. I would recommend it to everyone I know. It keeps you on your toes the whole book. Love
0802473156|5.0|As soon as I picked up this book the &#34;Duh!&#34; light went on. As you read it (and it is such an easy read) you think- wow, this is so clear and so simple, and so true. Why didn't I know this before?! It's great, because you can digest the information quickly and implementing the tools it teaches you is simple. You feel like you can begin making positive changes in your relationship immediately, because, the only person we can change is ourselves- but by changing ourselves, we can make huge changes in how our partners relate to us. This book really spoke to me, I love it, and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. As I finished reading it, I had the urge to buy and send one to every couple I know :-) It should come with your marriage certificate!
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Worth every penny to purchase and every minute spent to read it.  There isn't anything here that isn't available on the net, but this will give you a reliable single source.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|i like the case because it is to keep clean and get on and off the phone easy i c itould recommend
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. It gave a new outlook on love for.me. When you thought this book was over it hit you with another shocker. I loved it!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This book would have received 5 stars, but I have question on whether his characterization of certain political figures are based on fact or opinion.. Other than that, the story line is very engaging and the characters are vividly portrayed.<br /><br />I will say I preferred &#34;Pillars&#34; and &#34;World Without End&#34; to this novel and it's predecessor &#34;Fall of the Giants&#34;. Picking up any Ken Follett novel is never a mistake and you'll always be in for a great read by a great author.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't wait for the season premiere and wouldn't ha know it, I missed it. I was so fortunate to be able to have gone to Amazon prime to watch it commercial free.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a good game it can become addictive. Wish it had more ways to get free coins,because when you run out you have to wait to reload,only downer
158510423X|5.0|If you want to be challenged to observe the Latin language and to learn it by figuring it out like a puzzle, this is the book for you.  Best for those who are willing to let go of total certainty to figure out meanings based on the clues given in the context without the aid of English translations.  The format is set up to take you from simple sentences whose meanings are easily communicated through images and repetition, to increasingly more difficult sentences structures.  The story that is used as the base of teaching observation and understand of the language weaves in a fantastic cultural piece.<br /><br />Lingua Latina mimics total immersion as much as is possible with a book-based approach.  Fantastic if you are interested in actually learning the language and not just translating to English.
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I got this for my son for his birthday.  I pre-listened before buying it and liked it as well.  And decided to get this and his other CD for his birthday.<br />I also 1st saw & heard him on a PBS channel here in TX and liked his sound and knew my son would love it.
B008AYA7WE|4.0|Good game to pass the time!  I really like it.  its challenging.  Will keep the app for a long time.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Fantastic!  She has the most awesome sound.  I especially like that she composes her songs herself.  Cannot wait until she puts out a new CD.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book made me realize all the positives that come out of being an introvert. I recommend this book to anyone who is having trouble accepting who they really are. Great book!!!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|From the pilot to the extras, the hilarious first season of a truely landmark comedy can be enjoyed again...and again!  And isn't it a sign of an exceptional television show that you WANT to see it again? There is always so much going on with overlapping dialog and visuals that multiple viewings are always rewarded. The writing, direction, casting and acting are all exceptional; and the show has deservedly earned it's multiple Emmy's over it's run.  Every episode shows heart, and the family dynamics that form the basis of it's comedy can be related to by any viewer.
B005DOKK7Q|2.0|the fire zip sleeve is like a purse not a cover. It doesn't zip all the way around to fully open to read your kindle. you have to take it out of the zip sleeve to read. all it does is stores the kindle. colors and texture are good. It maybe suitable for a females to put in their bags.I just got the zip sleeve and it's not what I expect
B009186JYI|2.0|a secound rate home movie at best. just a money grab by the stones. good lord don't they have enough already?
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A crazy page turner. I feel like jordan, jealous, but like selena woeful. To love someone that deeply. Wow unnerving
B0094LDZ9E|2.0|While it has a good message about challenging your own beliefs, it also feels politically driven.<br /><br />The dancing singing penguins are fun, but it failed to keep my daughter's interest for long.  This surprised me because she has an unusually strong love for penguins.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is the fourth installment in the Game of Thrones saga, it is one of the best books of the series. Many twists I didn't expect, u will not want to put it down.  George RR Martin has created an unbelievable story that u will want to be part of!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is an amazing story with twists and turns you probably can't figure out.  the plot starts slowly, and I think some of the romantic scenes detract from the plot.  And I was initially not sure if this was a teen novel (Pretty sure it is not).  I'd like to see this author do more in this genre for adults, and focus more on her story line rather than the sexual parts, because the story line is soooooo good.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love to play on this app it is the best app I have ever played I wish I played it 5 years ago
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I chose to rate this book 4 out of 5 stars because every chapter left me wanting to read the next one. I also felt that this book was an easy read.....it didn't have me looking for definitions of unfamiliar words. I was looking to expand my reading genre when I chose this book. Now, I am glad I did. This is an excellent book for any young adult.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|When The Tudors ended, I despaired not having another series to watch. Then along came Spartacus with Andy Whitfield. Then he had a sudden resurgence of cancer from which he was previously in remission, and he was gone. Then the creators came up with an ingenious idea: create a prequel that tells the story of Crixus. They kept five to six of the original cast from the first series, and viewers got to see others like Barca, who died in the middle of the first season. Above that, GOTA introduced Gannicus. Played by Dustin Clare, Gannicus is one of the few characters that does the most fascinating evolution throughout the series, and shows a range of acting that is strikingly absent in most of the other characters, save Andy Whitfield from the first season. His evolution continues in Spartacus: Vengeance, and he and Crixus (played by Manu Bennett) do an excellent job as major supporting actors, helping die-hard fans of the first season who miss Andy Whitfield's presence.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|My 3 year old daughter loves this movie. She watched it several times and never got bored.  I rented it, but will purchase it in the near future.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|When The Tudors ended, I despaired not having another series to watch. Then along came Spartacus: Blood and Sand with Andy Whitfield. From the moment I watched the first episode, I was hooked, in spite of the fact that I thought the series was a fascinating combination of soft porn and 300 (with Gerard Butler. Nonetheless, I was faithfully on my couch watching it repeatedly. John Hannah was transformed from the goofy sidekick in the Mummy franchise to a scheming, social-climbing head of a ludus. Lucy Lawless went from the heroine of Xena: Warrior Princess to a villain to be reckoned with. She was so good, that I can no longer think of her as Xena anymore. And then there was the series' title character, played by Andy Whitfield (1971-2011). The role was truly made for him. He had the right balance of sympathy and savagery, and not to mention the looks and the body. His performance in Spartacus reminded me of Russell Crowe's Gladiator. If you liked the two films I mentioned, you will absolutely love this series. Keep in mind, however, that Blood and Sand is the only one of the Spartacus series that features Whitfield, who died in 2011, before filming of the next season.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|As my title states, this show has been able to keep a refreshing pace well into season 10. The acting is top-notch, and the individual cases as well as story arcs will keep you guessing. One of my favorite TV shows, ever.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Alicia Keys does it once again with this album. There are two reasons this did not make my five-star rating: one, on the album, she only includes the Nikki Minaj version of &#34;Girl on Fire&#34;; it would have been great to have both versions on the album. Second, her song &#34;Not Even the King&#34; while nice in sentiment, was kind of a snooze-fest. I found myself either skipping over the sound or turning the CD off at this point. The highlight of the album undoubtedly has to be her duet with Maxwell, &#34;Fire We Make.&#34; The song is HOT!
B00127RAJY|5.0|She kicks your butt but its amazing I recommend watching it through first so you hear all of her suggestions on form though because some times she tells you on your second set and it could already be too late
B0072OFM28|5.0|When The Tudors ended, I despaired not having another series to watch. Then along came Spartacus with Andy Whitfield. Then he had a sudden resurgence of cancer from which he was previously in remission, and he was gone. Spartacus: Gods of the Arena came out as a prequel while producers figured out what to do. And then Liam McIntyre became the new Spartacus. While his acting seems to be more poetic than the grittiness and savagery that Andy Whitfield brought to the role, the series is still admirable in the way it tied together both the first season and the prequel. another major cast change was that of Naevia, formerly played by Lesley-Ann Brandt. Cynthia Addai-Robinson, who is now cast in the role, is less delicate, and more warrior than wallflower. Very interesting plot twists, and a very satisfying ending for  Spartacus fans.
B004FP1WX0|3.0|I went into this movie on a recommendation, just knowing that it was about internet relationships and how screwed up they can be.  Watched the trailer first and got a sense that the main character falls in love with a woman who's not what she seems.<br /><br />To be honest, about halfway through I thought this was going to turn into a Paranormal Activity or Blair Witch Project style horror movie.  While that might have been entertaining I'm glad they didn't.<br /><br />What you get in the end is a real life situation that's not just a bunch of lies, you also get the motivation behind the whole thing in the form of an emotional confession.  It's sad really, how someone's life can become so pathetic that they create this whole world on Facebook in an attempt to reach out to what they've missed out on...and how that can hurt the person at the other end.<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth seeing once, especially if you're debating social media and especially online dating.  It's not to say that every cyber romance turns out this way, while not the worst case situation this one is definitely full of lies; but it serves as a warning to be on your toes and verify as much as you possibly can what the person at the other end is telling you.
1591841216|4.0|Simple read but not as great as &#34;It's not how Good you are...&#34; This one kind off compliments that other one so if you've got spare change and time, pick it up but don't expect it to be as great as the other.
B003GDYN24|5.0|I have never been a fan of Kelis. Of course I have heard both \\"Milkshake\\" and \\"Trick me\\". But that was it...until I listened to \\"Fleshtone\\". It took completely by surprise.<br />There are only 9 songs on the album, but any of them could be called \\"a filler\\". Looking through the list of composers I found names like: Benassi or David Guetta. They did a great job here.<br />I cannot avoid comparing this cd to \\"MDNA\\" by Madonna. Unfortunately, for the queen of pop, it seems that Kelis was first to find and use the talents of beforementioned dj's.<br />This time Madonna just followed.<br />Stand-out tracks? \\"Emancipate\\", \\"22-nd of july\\", \\"Home\\".<br />In one sentence: It's music for dance-freaks :)
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|I found the first chapter of Girl Trade both shocking and highly erotic.  I was hooked, even as a few times I was appalled.  I couldn't stop reading and found this book to be a naughty, naughty delight.  The author paints a vivid picture of exotic lands as the heroine, a young girl from London, sets off on an erotic adventure like no other.  Emily has it all on the surface - a good job, good friends, and good social standing.  But she's bored to tears with her life, and she doesn't feel like she knows herself.  Not really.  So she does something impulsive and swims through the ocean to a tiny island where she meets the beachcomber who strips away her freedom.<br /><br />As the book continued on, I became mesmerized by Emily and her path to personal discovery as she becomes \\"Chengi\\" and grows to care for a sheikh.  I hung on every word and kept turning the pages, so enthralled was I by her compelling internal voice, and all the thoughts going through her head as she attempts to rationalize and come to terms with her behavior in a new world of pleasure, pain, and sexual service.  Girl Trade, without a doubt, has the potential to become a cult book.  It's a book I'll keep to read again and again.  I look forward to reading more works by Chloe Thurlow and would love to see a sequel to Girl Trade.
0670026603|5.0|I don't give very many books a 5 star rating but this one deserves it!  The characters are all so fine tuned and you truly see how they all feel.  You will laugh and cry and be touched in many ways. Just be careful, once you start reading you won't be able to stop.  I think this beautiful story would make an amazing movie!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book was well written and hard to put down, I highly recommend this book, I will look for more from this author
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I like the search board and may come to love it but I'm still learning to navigate it right now.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|I remembered this movie from my childhood so I ordered it for Christmas. Just as I remembered! Great movie, not your typical modern Hollywood Christmas movie and can be seen by all ages!
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|Its super boring I would waste 99¢ on something else this is boring game. Don't buy it this game is boring.
B006IVBSBU|1.0|Terrible movie. Awful writing. I wish I had worn a mask during the film.<br /><br />The beginning, when people are dropping like wiggly flies, is the high point of this silly episode. Every cliche possible is presented = a doctor kidnapped so she will give vaccine to a village, an unfaithful wife getting her head sawed open on the autopsy table so the doctors can see that her sulci are destroyed, a bad man selling worthless healing snake oil and making 4 million bucks in the process, a big, evil company practicing deforestation which starts the whole epidemic.<br /><br />You get the picture. No good.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Awesome app, but I wish it had mPoints like my mobile version has.  Otherwise, no complaints.  It's very responsive and does exactly what it's supposed to do.
B000W93CHC|5.0|another ken follett book that I could not put down , just as good as pillers of the earth maybe even better
B0061S073A|3.0|I need it to do a lot more. Why can't individual apps have time limits?  Why should Angry Birds and Math Flash cards be subject to the same time restrictions.  Each app and each book should be able to be restricted individually.<br /><br />Also, personal documents cannot be accessed in protected mode.  Any eBooks I've gotten from sources other than Amazon are not available for my kids to read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I cant wait for the next one I have not been able to put it down , maybe even better than the first book ,
B004Z2TUGE|2.0|So predictable in the first few minutes that I couldn't watch all of it. Nothing new or exciting here. Movies like this are a dime a dozen.
B004UJAOLM|1.0|I gave this one star, not because you can go no lower, but because it is well-written and has a coherent story line.  Aside from that,  however, I found it quite lacking.  I personally found the story to be dreadful and unpleasant.  I generally have no issue with unpleasant characters or unhappy endings,  but aside from the writing style and Bronte's ability to hold the story together in a clear manner I found nothing enjoyable about it, and pleasant or not books are meant to be enjoyed, elsewise you're wasting your time.
B004DM0UII|3.0|It's an all right radio player, and there are several out there to try. I tried several radio stations and all of them came in clearly, no problem. I do wish the controls were a little more intuitive, especially when looking for a station. I had to really dig just to find Top 40, which is what I listen to most... as do most people. Also, I wish I could search by location as I'd rather listen to something local or from a specific country. No major complaints, but nothing about this blew me away either. If you are looking for Internet radio, try the trial first before dropping upwards of five dollars on this.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I had put off reading this for several decades, imagining it to be overly-girly and saccharine.  Finally coming across it on list after list of must-reads I decided to give it a chance, and I must say I'm glad I did.  I found the storyline pleasant, the characters relateable even so many years after its writing,  and the entire book incredibly charming and delightful.
B0058VW36U|1.0|THIS IS THE WORST APP EVER. UOU SHOULD NEVER GET IT. MINECRAFT IS SO MICH BETTER. SO DONT GRT IT!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|LITTLE TO MUCH BOUNCING AROUND HARD TO KEEP UP WITH THE SITUATIONS AND THE BAD GUYS OTHERWISE A GOOD BOOK

B009KHBDUU|4.0|My wife and I really enjoyed the movie. We're  big Johnny Depp fans anyway but this movie was better than we expected.
B00884GR0W|1.0|THIS APP IS HORIABLE DONT GET IT IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY WHAT KIND OF PERSON WOULD GETVIT<br /><br />I WARNED YOU SO DONT GET IT OR SAY GOOD BY TO YOUR KINDLE FIRE BECAUSE OF THE VIRS!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a great app my son loves it! It's a very cool app I recommend this app to parent specially if you are traveling keep kids busy and and like the fact that kids can use their imagination because they need to create !
B0058GYP5W|5.0|We enjoyed the movie so my adult son wanted the cd as a gift. He has enjoyed it aver since.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I hope its made into a mini-series.  It's perfect for that.  Steven King has written a rather non-scary but fun story.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Although we're seniors, my wife loves Taylor's new album. Catchy tunes - my wife listens in the car. She's a big fan now.
B0091THDOM|5.0|I love this case because it fits my iPhone 5 perfectly and i can just slip it in my pocket and not have to have it hanging off my belt.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook works ok if you just need to log in to your account the normal way. However, when you have to use it for some games like style me girl, it doesnt connect at all. Or it could be because of my privacy settings on facebook, i don't know for sure why it doesnt connect.
B001F12J0C|4.0|Just received the package yesterday and watched all three.  In the last movie, there appears to be enough room for  one more comeback.  A final show-down in The White House.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Its so easy to use twitter on the kindle fire. I use it for the style me girl game :-)
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Wow! This is a must see film, if you are squeamish just close your eyes to the few gory scenes. This is a true story during the Prohibition and boot leggin era that's what makes this film a must see. I enjoyed it but it did give me a few nightmares, but i am a women, my husband did not have a problem watching and enjoying this film.
B00127RAJY|3.0|This is great for those who love vigorous work outs. I tried it but its not for me because I do not like high intensity workouts. I'll stick with Leslie Sansome thank you very much. However Jillian is good at what she does, you just have to like her work out style.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Thank you this is a movie that is a traditional Clint movie that reminds me of what I would do in his position.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love that you just tap the cards and they know where to go. It also had more features that stand out. Its more fun playing spider solitaire on the kindle fire than on the computer.
0812416503|2.0|This item was listed as a hardcover book but it was actually a paperback version that had a hard cover put on it.  When I order a book that is listed as a hardcover, I expect it to be a full-size hardcover copy.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is a great book for whoever is in any kind of a relationship. It works well for a romantic relationship but I really think it could apply to all kinds of relationships, sisters, girlfriends, etc. It offers sound and practical advice. It offers tips on things you can do right away, I already tried the requesting-instead-of-demanding tip right after I read it and guess what, it worked! Its crazy how we overlook some things or think of them as trivial but if you implement Dr Chapman's advice, you get instant results, if not long lasting. This book is a must have for everyone. Now I understand why my mom and cousin kept insisting that I needed to read it :-)
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This is a very fast read but manages to pack excellent material in a concise format.  Any game of Mark's shows or blog would enjoy!
B008FYZIVY|2.0|Probably would be great, but the UK version I bought on Amazon does not play on US disc players...It is constantly pausing, so it is impossible to watch. I even bought a new DVD player, thinking something was wrong with mine...and it did same. So, watch what you buy!
B004H3WWU2|5.0|A friend had this bag and it looked great. I got it for my husband and he loves it. It's not bulky and has great ways to stay organized and best if all does not look dorky!
B009KKLQVS|5.0|I went to that concert! It was great!!! It was MUCH Longer than the Blu-ray. I was rather disappointed in that it wasn't the ENTIRE CONCERT, but what is on the Blu-ray is excellent!!! They guys STILL HAVE IT!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|These characters come to life as they step off the page, for their story is as real as our front-page headlines. The dark subject matter and the sex scenes are tastefully written.  It's a novel that you will feel, experience, and never forget. For it affirms life, provides hope, and most of all love in its purest form.  I'm looking forward to reading anything by this awesome author!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Josh Brolin absolutely nailed the young Tommy Lee Jones character Agent K.. Even though this movie is MIB 3, it is able to stand alone without having seen the first two MIB movies. Plenty of action and the great play between Agent J and Agent K makes this movie a very enjoyable experience. My only complaint was the lack of interaction with Frank the pug dog agent. He would have been great with Emma Thompson's character. But overall, it was an enjoyable movie to watch and worth the rental fee. In fact, I'll probably rent it again!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Nice attempt to reproduce a Bourne movie. However, without Matt Damon is a failure. The movie end is open, makes me think there will be a following.<br />If you don't want to be boring (since would be the 5th) is better to have Matt Damon in it and a good story.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Makes you -reevaluate your life, and the meaning. Thought provoking. Gives a new prospective on the holocaust, mans inhumanity to many.
B001NLJ33K|4.0|This is a very good action movie. Sometime the story seems too impossible.  However still entertaining and enjoyable and recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A<br />perfect ending. So when do we get the three books with Christian s version of the whole relationship. CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Incredibly funny. Actors were great, the story was also great in the contest of a funny movie. The British humor is just hilarius. If you wanna laugh this is the right one.
B001BANK32|4.0|I saw the movie many years ago and put off reading the book even though I'm a Stephen King fan. The book of course has much more depth than the movie and the story line is different enough that it was not at all predictable.<br />  A good read, even if you've seen the movie!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|You are playing Irene looking for your sister from the first game, and you go to magic school to ask around about your sister. While there you help the teachers by playing these very short mini games.  Good:  graphics, music, and easy use. Bad: story,  talking (needs voiceover) on and on, and game to short. I found the zoom works great you go from small to big. For an no thinking hidden object it gets three stars.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|This was a good movie with really fine acting.<br /><br />A little gritty subject matter, but well worth a watch...check it out
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read this book in three days. Not an easy task considering its length- but I didn't want to put it down. I haven't slept much, I've skipped work and I forget what my husband looks like but it was worth it.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Easy read but became a little repetitive.  Excellent building up of a picture of the characters even though somewhat unrealistic.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My 6 yr old granddaughter wanted it.  Not as kid friendly to work as i thought it would be, but she had fun.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|This film is truly, truly awful.  I'm at a loss to comprehend how Ridley Scott made this monstrosity.  He had over 30 years to think about it and this is what he comes up with.  What makes it all the worse is that Alien is possibly one of the finest films ever made.  I'm not going to write an analysis of the film, just read all the other one star reviews; they pretty much sum it all up.<br /><br />Two hours 15 mins of my life I can never have back.
B005CVJUQC|4.0|Item was purchased because of a interest in the voice of Judith Blegen. The music itself is something that I will need more experience with to more fully appreciate; therefore, the rating is not as high as I think it deserves.
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|My husband and I tried to watch the first episode on Netflix and could not get through the show due to the unnecessary sexual content.  I guess we thought it would be an interesting show sort of like Tales from the Crypt but it was not.  When my husband gets agitated alot on the first episode I usually know it is the last episode he will watch!  LOL...  Sorry I can't be of help as I only watched 1/2 of one episode but we didn't care for it at all.  Thanks!
1603427244|5.0|A great collection of cast ons and bind offs. The techniques  are sorted into groups which makes it easy to find exactly what you want. A must have for your knitting bag.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its good its just need stuff from the xbox and pc and i trying to downloed it i heard it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was Amazing!!  I can't wait for the next book to be released in May.  Highly Recommended!! Loved it!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is pretty amazing for the price point.  Very well thought out and designed, I can fit 2 cameras, my 70-200, 3 flashes, and couple of extra lenses inside it.  A lot of small pockets which I kept all of my batteries and other accessories in.  It could be a little bigger with a laptop pouch but for $30, you can't beat it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book. it's so creative. I was not expecting that. That was funny. I almost went #1 in my pants.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Wonderful story with tremendous presentation.  My 4 and 9 year old grand daughters enjoy the story as much as I do.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I love this movie, and I cant believe I was able to get it on Amazon for the price of $4.99!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|The idea is wonderful.  The execution goes to far past vulgar to even be tollerable.  Too bad they didn't think this through before they started.
B006TTC590|5.0|I really liked the movie when it came out and am pleased that it has held up so well over the years!  Music is great and seeing so many of the wonderful blues artists perform is not to be missed!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|The producers took the Bourne series in a new direction with this sort-of sequel to the previous Borune movies. This movie take place mostly parallel to the events of the last Jason-centric Bourne movie, the Bourne Ultimatum.<br /><br />No worries though. Even though Jason Bourne only appears courtesy of stock footage this movie does not disappoint. Viewers are quickly introduced to Aaron Cross, yet another good-guy secret agent on the run from mysterious forces within the US government's department of defense.<br /><br />A US department of defense task force, headed by Edward Norton, attempts to tie up loose ends from a failed super solider program, and the plot really picks up from there. As secret agents are &#34;disposed of&#34; around the globe you really find yourself rooting for Aaron Cross hoping he is able to escape and find the inner peace he desperately craves.<br /><br />The action is top notch including an amazing chase scene near the end of the movie that is not to be missed.  A+ recommendation to fans of action movies & spy thrillers.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Has rules built in, so that it does not let you make an illegal move.  We have not played it as a skilled player, but for someone learning it has really helped!
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|We got this movie in the time allowed and in great condition.  It works like a charm.  My granddaughter loves it.
B008478VE8|5.0|A free copy of Darwin's Origin of Species.  How could it not be 5 stars?  This is a great read for anyone!  Why do they have min # of word guidelines, sometimes this just makes it drag on!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show, and streaming it for FREE with Amazon Prime was so easy. This allowed me to catch up on this show before season 3 started.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|We have downloaded several drawing apps, but this is the one we use the most!  Gives so many options on color and style of stroke, def recommended!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Good Quality. No issues streaming. The episode was very good. I am looking forward to the rest of the season.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I have played this game on and off since it first came out. Received update and can't purchase new game. Would be great if I could.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Arrived on time and works great.  Definitely one of my favorites to watch with the kids.  It's hilarious!  Highly recommended.
B009KHCT94|4.0|C'mon, folks, this is the film that Ingmar Bergman wanted to make! This is like &#34;The Seventh Seal&#34; but without any of that heavy philosophical stuff.<br /><br />This has everything you really want in a film. German helmets with breathing apparatussesesesses. Motorcycles and sidecars cruising down moon highways. Goose-stepping Tea Party members--I mean, storm troopers with submachine guns. Flying Saucers. Giant chain-driven engines. Punch-card computers the size of a fire engine. And a hot Aryan blonde who keeps her clothes on, but only just. And super-ginormous zeppelins in space!!!<br /><br />A cool black dude kicks Nazi butts, President Palin running for re-election on a stride-glider, and would-be Wagner orchestrations as super galactic space battles commence. This isn't science fiction--it's science fact! Well, OK, mebbe not, but it SHOULD be...<br /><br />A delightful smaller-budgeted film that uses every cent they had to spend, with filmmakers who simultaneously obviously loved what they were creating and didn't take themselves too seriously, and delivered a lot of action and fun. It is rather a pastiche, not a serious sci-fi movie, and so much the better.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game always finds ways to keep me interested. keep up the great work! and its free!! I'm so glad I downloaded it!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A fascinating, true and objective account,  covering both sides of the airwar in Europe during WWII. Importantly it covers the human side of the conflict, and  chivalry often overlooked, by focusing on a unique event --- a story needed to be told. Congratulatiuons to the author for the fine and exhaustive research that went into this book. it is good to the last page !
B007HACDLK|3.0|The coolest part of the book was that most of it took place in Afghanistan and Pakistan and delt with some current and very realistic scenarios.  The storyline suffered a little bit from Flynn's attepmt to convey Mitch Rapp's personal reflection about his occupation by giving him &#34;AMNESIA?&#34;.  I mean seriously, what is this &#34;Days of our Lives&#34;?  The bad thing is that he blew his opportunity to let Mitch either do some real reflection and come to a conclusion or just decide to live with the conflict.  Instead he sort of lets it slide past so instead of getting to a character with more depth coming from the event your just left wondering if Rapp is going to wuss out at any moment.  Part of the character's appeal is his unflinching dedication to his cause.  So, I'm not really  sure why Flynn messed with his head then never resolved the issue.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book was a great casual read. It was exciting and interesting the whole way through. I would definitely recommend this book to others.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Probably will get off this I don't like it, to easy for people to get information. I had a guy tell me how sexy I was in my picture and I didn't know him. That was scary
B00338QENI|4.0|I came to read this book by accident.  I rarely read biographies, so it is not the type of book I would ever  consider reading.  I'm not even sure the book can be called a biography.  This is an astounding body of research,  exceptionally well reported.  Once I started reading I could not stop.  The faster technology  advances the farther it runs ahead of regulation.  Let us all beware.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I about died when they starting using each others lines from movies, that was great. Expendables 2 was even better
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun for all ages, very addictive and lots of cute dragons. can't go wrong lol. works well on my kindle fire as well.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Amazing I never knew how fun this was til my grandson started playing now I play it all the time....fun
B003RNXIBK|5.0|i am 39, and i love this album...love eminem and almost everything he comes up with. great find, thanks for decent purchase price. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I win so much makes me wan to play more. Very easy to play and it is a lot of fun
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not stop reading! Truly beautiful heart breaking story. A new favourite of mine. Going to recommend this book to all my friends.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I donwloaded this by accident or my grandson did don't know and I don't play this game so I can not rate it really
B004S49YEM|3.0|I enjoyed it, well constructed, an unexpected end, I generally enjoy Ken Folletts books, and it is great having it on ibooks
B009X01GJ2|3.0|They should have put the opening for the charger on the top side of the case instead of where it stands up.  It is difficult to plug in the charger to recharge the HD with the case on it. You lose the protection of the case cover.
0385341008|5.0|I read and re-read this book many times, and enjoy the writing, the story and the characters who are all bigger than life-size
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love that it opens to a full screen and it is easy to use. So glad to have found this app.
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy is my favorite yet.  While I loved The Lord Of The Rings trilogy the Hunger Games moves so fast that I found myself on the edge of my seat. Especially the final book.  The only thing that made me a bit doubting about Katniss' character was her lack of being able to understand her feelings and herself when it came to loving two young men while she was so adept at reading other people.  But in all fairness love is a very difficult thing to put a handle on.  And it is difficult when you must choose one person when you love two. Also Katniss is very very hard on herself and negative at times.  But in a world like Panem I guess it would be incredibly hard not be negative a lot. The choice she makes at the end when given one arrow is certainly the correct one.  Great trilogy and a fast-moving read. Thank you Suzanne Collins.  I think I will read all your books now.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a suspenseful and intense story! I could not put this book down. I loved the story of survival, and of course, love. I also loved the surprise ending! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an action packed story, mixed with a little romance and love.
B004Q1FDHO|2.0|I tried this on my Droid X2 and the game caused lockups, overheats, reboots and freezing. Motorola stated this was an issue with the software so I removed it and did not return.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed this novel very much.  I want to find out what happens with Juliette and Silo 17 and 18.  I hope the author continues this storyline as I thought this character was developed well.
B004VMVTNU|1.0|I tried this on my Droid X2 and the game caused lockups, overheats, reboots and freezing. Motorola stated this was an issue with the software so I removed it and did not return.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Excellent read. One of Cornwell's best to date. You will get engrossed by the end of the first chapter.check it out....
B00005N6KG|5.0|I like these headphones. They have a bit of a weird shape but they are super lightweight. They are good to workout with. The sound quality is great for the price and I would recommend this product to everybody.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|The best surf movie of all time! Good story (true) and the best filming! Action you feel in your gut! Do not pass over this movie. It will surprise you!
B000ZM7VVO|4.0|Great album with the rock/punk/ irish folk feel that we have come to love from Flogging Molly. No complaints and no surprises. Good mix of some fast and slow tracks. Enjoy.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|my wife bought this book on my account by mistake, i assumed she bought it because of the reviews it had
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking up married is a different type of love story. But it is so well written that you end falling in love with it.
B005FITIDC|5.0|this movie was a little rough around the edges but something men would enjoy.  I got this for my dad and I think he enjoyed it.  Came in time for Christmas so thanks for that
0439023491|5.0|This added to my grandsons collection. He loves the books and the movie. I haven't read them yet, maybe I will.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really wish there were more options on the calculater. but otherwise there this is a good calculater and I use it all the time in my math classes.
B009APMNB0|4.0|This product is extremely easy to use. Compared to alternatives, it is also hassle free - you just plug it and put it in place and the software does the rest. If you're into photography at all, this is the first thing you should buy. Believe me, screen calibrations vary wildly enough to warrant the expense.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Great movie for the whole family. My kids are 8&1/2, almost 11 and newly turned 14 and we all loved it!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Amazing picture quality on the Blu-Ray. The addendum (favorite things box, etc) is a little gimmicky, but might make for a good gift.<br /><br />All in all, this is a breathtaking quality print of a timeless classic... for kids and adults alike :)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Could not put it down. Very clever, the way the characters' personal stories are intertwined with world events. Makes a lot more sense if you've already read the first book.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Fantastic movie, great quality blu-ray disc. It's too bad it doesn't come with a digital copy that I can view on any device anywhere.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie was great for a night in with the family and was surprisingly enjoyable for the adults as well. Pixar always does a great job. Two thumbs up!
B00AEFVRB2|5.0|I really liked this movie, very good cast, great story because it could be reality very easy. It's the perfect &#34;Scam Gone Wrong&#34; I liked it so much I watched it 2 mites later with my wife
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Purchased it for my Grandson and he really enjoys it. I hear him laughing as he plays. He asked that I buy it.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|This game brings back memories of my Sega Dreamcast, plays exactly the same and is probably one of the few games that can actually make the transition from console to smartphone.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|We need something for my child to make it easy for her to access the YouTube videos and this made it harder.
B0053O89JM|5.0|This was purchased as a gift.  Sorry that there will be no more episodes of house.  Don't know what I'll give this person!!
B0091QS88K|5.0|She loves making the food and serving it then cleaning it away. The same food and the same activity over and over again.  We made a good choice.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I couldnt put this book down! Even pulled an all-nighter reading it! Just finished book two and can't wait for book three!
B008NEMPTO|5.0|Great movie!!  Almost believable, many historical facts thrown in to go along with the movie.  Great action and 3D effects!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun app and at times challenging.  I enjoy playing, as does my 9 and 13 year old.  Nice change from the typical games out there.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|If you are a fan of the Ice Age movies you will enjoy this one!  Both kids and adults will enjoy this one.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|Our family loves all of the Schleich toys. This one is no exception.  It is perfectly crafted, came in great condition, and will last through years of playtime!
B008518MOW|5.0|I think this is one of the best ones so far or at least on par with the original one.  Really good in 3D and in keeping with MIB of past movies.
B004GXL3DU|5.0|Our family loves all of the Schleich toys. This one is no exception.  It is perfectly crafted, came in great condition, and will last through years of playtime!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I had another calculator on my phone and figured one was just as good as any other.  It was a bit cumbersome and took some getting used to, even then I felt it was difficult to navigate around.  Seriously, a calculator isn't that hard is it?  So I thought I would check out others and this one is the best, easiest, clearest, etc.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I'm not going to retread what others have said, if you enjoy the books you'll enjoy the series.  If you haven't tried it out you should, it's damned fine television.  That said:<br /><br /> I thought about knocking a star off for this but it's not about the quality of the series but rather HBO's asinine tactic of treating the honest buyer like a crook.  I HATE the fact that I paid for this and have to sit through nearly 10 minutes of previews and BS anti-piracy warnings every time I pop in a new disc.  If someone had a bootleg they wouldn't have to deal with any of that.  Eff you, HBO.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|As I read this book I could hear the voices of the actors from the A&E series.  It makes me like both more.  I have never watch a book adapted for screen that compliments the book so well.  It is hard to put into words how good this book is.  I will say it in the simplest way possible.  It is a refreshingly simple kind of complex.
B008OOYALE|2.0|To the other games such as Tiny Monsters and Tiny Village, I would prefer Tiny Monsters over this one. But for dinosaur lovers it would be probably their preference.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Keeps you entertained for hours. Recommend. You wont be disappointed. I like the scariness. It does at times seem too hard
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Awesome! Happy to have finished this series or maybe not? Good series however and the way the book ends there will be more and soon I hope!
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|Overall it was a decent book but I was somewhat dissapointed because the book was easy to put down and hard to pick back up. The first part and the middle part of the book was just boring and at the end it completly left me hanging and anticipating for the next book like Son of Neptune did. I also felt that the charcters like Piper or Hazel over used their powers. I am a huge fan of the author and I hope I will not be disapointed by his next book.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|It was a good movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 1
030758836X|4.0|i loved this book and read it in about 3 days. all of the twists and turns really made it a page turner and i just couldnt stop reading it! i have to say i wanted to punch amy when i found out her evil plan. as much as i did enjoy this book (its the first book by gillian flynn i've read) when i read the last page my jaw literally dropped- i couldn't believe thats how it ended! i felt so unsatisfied with the conclusion. while the rest of the book was great, the ending just didnt do it for me.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and look forward to a part 2 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B009VB97EY|5.0|Channing is the sexiest thing ever! You wont regret getting this movie, great for girls night! And the play all dance scene option is amazing
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent characters that are played exceptionally well by all the actors.  The script is well written and transcends the viewer to the period in time and effortlessly takes you through the changes in time and tradition.  Well done.<br />If anyone is just finding Downton Abbey you must see Season's 1 & 2 as you will better appreciate Season 3.  As Season 3 introduces Cora's mother (Shirly MacLaine) to the audience I was somewhat disappointed.  Ms MacLaine's dialog seemed \\"forced\\" not \\"natural\\" (in another sense it comes across as \\"acting\\").  I hope that this will change, as I am so looking forward to when the three (Matthew' mother, Grand Ma Ma, and Cora's mother) are in a scene together.  I can only imagine the jabs with such jest!!  Grand Ma Ma (Maggie Smith)is such a delight.  I find myself on many occasions laughing out loud at her retorts.<br />Eagerly anticipating episode 2.
B0055SWM08|1.0|i givee this app a 1 star rating because the rating is meanIngless if u want me to rate the game on little to no game play ihave nothing to base said rating on soof course im going to give u a one
1419705849|5.0|Every school library I have visited lately has all 7 of these books flying off the shelves.  Students point out their favorite parts and clamor for the next book in the series.  The Third Wheel has captured the feelings of preteen and young teen readers in a format they are enjoying.  For those of us with a few more years, it is a delightful journey back to our memories.
B005LAII8K|5.0|We watched this a week ago and everyone commented on it the next day.  They thought about it all night.  It was a different plot that all the movies out there now and made you think!  We enjoyed it!  Liked Bruce Willis, as always!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really good. it starts off super easy, and then steadily gets super hard. you could play this for hours and not get bored!
1580176941|5.0|This book is easy to read and understand.  It does not require you to go out and buy lots of new things just to make beautiful cookies.  It tells you how to better use every day items you already have in your kitchen.  Has some little decorating secrets that I did not know about before.  I very much enjoyed reading this book and will use it for Valentine's Day cookies!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|How not to love any collen hoover book?! Love the story which is in my opinion original (not the typical love story) and the characters!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Decent end to a decent trilogy. Will like to see how it looks on the big screen. Should be ok
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Passion for life, passion for someone else, passion for happiness... Loved the characters and their personalities; the situations were less believable with so many different twists but still kept me intrigued with Sky and Holder's passion. I love stories surrounding characters who can't stay away from each other.
B005I735F2|5.0|You gotta get this 2 CD collection if your an ELO Fan. Great selection of ELO classic cuts, and beats the pants off the Lackluster\Flat sound of 'Afterglow&#34;. We have a 1200 watt stereo system, and the difference is night-and-day.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy playing but only draw back is pop up apps<br />..... really can spend lots of time playing this game it is fun and the game is as fast as you are
B0058DRUV6|2.0|Hard to read,little dry but good information. It was hard to pick back up. But once I did I could stay with it for the information.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Was never able to down load the song.  Went  to a store and bought the album.  Rod is great.  I'll never<br />Buy a single again. Better off going to iTunes
B003ODIZL6|1.0|In the book, it says, WTF and some kids can have  a kindle, and  that is not right for them to learn that yet.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The best  thing is  the  detail  he went  in to.  I lived  those  years  and  I  was  just  WOWED!!!!  I  can  undered  why  he  had  to  wait  to  write  it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is an amazing author and so talented with words. Her vivid descriptions enraptured you and make you feel part of the entire experience. Sky led a life sheltered from technology (no TV, no cellphone, no Internet) and was homeschooled by her adopted mother. Only in her senior year was she allowed to attend a regular school. She saw Dean Holder in a grocery store and felt an intense physical attraction to him which she never experienced before. Later, she found out that Dean also attended the same high school. They embarked on a relationship and this was a catalyst to discovering dark secrets.

B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was a waste of my time.  There were no redeeming qualities in any of the characters, the writing was stilted, and the depth of exploration of each character was repetitive.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like fruit kings it is cool and awesome it connects to wifi you could unlock slivers and backgrounds it is fun like I said I am glad you guys have this game it is very intrasting even my brothers and sisters like it very much even my parents this is the best game I could ever play with and they don't even like fruit so you have to go on journeys and slice the Frunze like a kings.  it is the top popular and that people would. like
0446310786|5.0|Had watched the movie several times. But never read the book. Found I enjoyed  the book more than the movie. One to read over and over. Pity she never wrote another book.
1439152802|5.0|This is one of my top five favorite books of all time. I also loved The Forgotton Garden, her last book, but this one far surpasses it. The depth of characters was exceptional and the story flowed well. I didn't want to put it down. The ending was nothing that I could have imagined. There were so many twists and turns and it all came together in the last part of the book. It was exceptional.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect - game canon can be so monotonous and, well, shitty - but this was a wonderful story. Not too long, very clear to imagine in the game setting, and just all-around enjoyable. The fall of Ascalon is one of my favorite bits of the Guild Wars lore, so this was very exciting for me. I would love it if other fiction concerning Ascalon were written by the authors, hint hint.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Would have given it 5 stars except the ad that pops up at the start is a pain to get around before you can start playing the game.
B005XLN97M|5.0|for what it is it holds together very well, is very colorful and has several pieces, it does not take long to put it together and the assembly is very easy
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Kept me interested and story line good. Nice graphics too. Looking forward to continuation of game and will let me friends know about it
B008OOYALE|5.0|This was so awesome I haven't slept for day's and I have Been playing so long I am level 14 and have a clown dragon
B001P9EQH8|4.0|Battery dead after 15 hours on medium volume which is useless because no one would use this setting as it gives the same or less volume than their player would, but since it is an amp presumabley you want more volume out than the mp3 player itself, so if you actually use it to boost the volume higher than the mp3 can deliver, the battery life will be shorter by a lot. Even so I really like it, it is tiny,  the size of a book of matches, charges nicely and good controls. Charge it for two hours before you use it. Forget the 20 hour battery life, look for maybe 6 or 7 hours of amplified performance.
B008CIUS72|1.0|I cant get this product to work! Do not waste your money on this product. It is not worth the time.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Good ebook. I have not read it all but it is a nice setting. Able to read it when I have nothing else to do and waiting in the car!
B003Y5H556|5.0|How I love you so.  This movie looked great in Blu Ray.  I highly recommend it to all Seyfried fans!<br />Oh by the way, the plot of the movie is aweful.  I'm suprised Gary Oldman signed on?
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is a great example of what's wrong with the stuffy, overly opinionated, closed minded, judgmental people of today's world. This movie is silly, far fetched, crass, dirty, has blatant (and rampant) drug use and language that would make my grandmother blush.<br /><br />Those ARE NOT bad things. I read a few of the reviews on here about this movie and rolled my eyes so hard I think I pulled something.<br /><br />***This is movie about a man and his loud mouth, real life teddy bear***<br /><br />What were you expecting - Oscar gold? Why is it people can't just enjoy something funny anymore without finding it offensive or upsetting? Just enjoy it for what it is.<br /><br />My review is as follows: I haven't laughed this hard during a movie in a long, long time. And (Spoiler Alert) when that Teddy Bear lost his life to some crazed lunatic, his stuffing spread across the field, yes I shed a tear. Sure, you know he's going to live and it'll be a happy ending but who cares? It's awesome.<br /><br />Seth McFarlane is one of the greatest funnymen out there. Mila Kunis is beautiful, Mark Wahlberg is hilarious and together they are a wonderful set. You can't help but like this guy who hasn't quite grown up and lives his life smoking pot with a stuffed toy, watching TV and finding ways to skip out on work. Mila Kunis is his incredibly patient GF who loves him and yet often wishes he wanted more out of life.<br /><br />The key to this movie is to let yourself go and not think too hard about what's going on. Sure, it won't change your life but for 200+ minutes, you'll find that all your troubles melt away and you'll really, truly have a good time.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|My girlfriend is a HUGE LP fan.  I got her this CD for xmas and she LOVED IT!!  She never shuts up about it actually.. It appears I made a mistake :-/
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I enjoy the audible so that when I am busy in the kitchen or whatever I can still listen to God' word!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. Works great on Kindle Fire. We live in a very rural area and have a hard time getting accurate and up-to-date information. This app is a real lifesaver for us.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|I always enjoy her books as they appeal to my sense of humour.  It is always a pleasure to read her books and I am looking forward to reading her latest book
B003K16P3M|5.0|Graceling was a wonderful novel with great ideas that I haven't seen in a lot of novels. It had awesome characters with dynamic personalities.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This is long enough to charge my kindle while reading. This cable is longer than the original that came with my global kindle a few years ago.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So, I have always heard good about this game but I always thought the idea was geeky. I bought this game for seven dollars and didn't realize what the game was about. I was completely wrong about this game because it is an awesome game especially for people who love building. There are a few problems though:<br /><br />-multiplayer problems<br />-survival doesn't play as good as PC version looks<br />-no texture packs or changeable skins without internet downloads (which usually have spams)<br />-not as many items as the PC<br /><br />Besides these, the game is great and highly recommended for those who love build and creating things!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I finally found a  Kindle cable long enough to allow me to read while charging my kindle fire. Just in case they stopped making them I bought two.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Starts slow but develops into a very interesting and fulfilling book! A very enjoyable story with some knowledge learned as well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Makes you concentrate on where to make your next move.  Can be frustrating if you don't pay attention.  Is also addicting, but I love it.  Happy I ordered it from Amazon.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Something new and different for me to play.  Another fun way to connect with friends and meet new players.  Thanks!
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|Great book!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Lot of action and a few ***** words, but all in all great reading.  Very glad I got it from Amazon.
B008MM9630|4.0|other apps give you free updates...this one has you pay or rate it for free updates. also it makes you buy stuff that cost diomends in quests...bad way of making an app.
B00A757EFW|1.0|eh.  screen is the same as old school pacman i remember, but you don't get the real feel without a joystick.
0307891402|5.0|Very precise about everything you want to know and more. I was able to play all the toons on this game and know everything there was to know about that race thanks to this well written book.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|I believe? Shorter ads will still be seen but not mentally blocked. Prove me wrong! Try a couple of seconds on one clip.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Soothing and relaxing to watch and listen to.  I was a bit stressed out when my kids began playing this, but  10 minutes into the game, I felt myself relaxing.  What a visually stimulating, yet relaxing Journey .
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|you will love it so get it it is addicting though my brother and I love it so so so much fun
B00028HBKC|5.0|Saw the movie - wanted to have my own copy so I can see it again each Holy Week.  The story never gets old
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was fascinating hearing Eben's story from the voice of a nueroscientist. As a nurse it gave me ears to hear his perspective in a very different mindset than I might anyone elses.
076115728X|5.0|I read this book to my kindergarten art class during my student teaching. They loved it so much, I read it to them two times in a row! (Most wanted me to read it a third time!) The theme of this book is great for all ages.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I know I'm gonna say this about the next book... and the book after that... and the book after that. But I have to say this is an excellent book! It is the rise of Kronos and the first appearance of a lot of characters such as Juniper, Mrs. O'Leary, the creator of the Labyrinth (forgot his name), Pan, and the first major role of Rachel Elizabeth Dare. Can't wait to read the next exciting book!
B003ES5ZTG|3.0|It wasn't good for what I bought it for.  It was too large to connect my Kindle to the TV .
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I'm glad the book was written in first person because her inner thoughts have raised some questions; questions that make me want to read the second book. I'm not sure I could have said that halfway thru this one, but it rebounded the last 100+ pages.
B005HSL626|4.0|but eventually it gets old and its just not all that good anymore!! its fun and im pretty sure u have already heard of this game!!! after like a yrar i deleted it cuz it got old!!!!
B0025X4OYI|5.0|Ray Charles at his universal best. So at ease extending his range in a supposedly foreign genre. Opeing it up to many who never really heard it before Made unique and real again for those who first loved to cry over them, these simple ballads bear a weight that is never shrugged off. If anyone understood joy and pain, it was Ray and he brings out the truth in every song. Fifty years later this music remains modern. Depth with complete sincerity, tuned naturally. Soulful arrangments with brilliant, understated orchestration.<br />  Easy to see why he was so accepted by  country/western hall-of-famers.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|it shouldnt be that money i have this on my i pod and i just dont think it is worth that much!!!
0385535147|5.0|My husband loved getting this book and I can not wait till he finishes reading it so that I can read it too.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a great story.  A must read for anyone interested in reading a truly entertaining book s s
B008458O3S|2.0|I deleted this game from my phone.  It was not a game I wanted to try and learn.  It maybe a great game, it just did not interest me.
B008HK3QII|5.0|I ordered this case yesterday and received it today via UPS. Very nice! The fabric is tough,the inside soft,& the outside beading will break a fall very well, thank you! My Kindle Fire HD fits in there like hand in glove. Nice work!
B008XG1X18|5.0|works great on my galaxy exhibit phone--fun to use--i love it!!!!  :)  lots and lots of great pix to look at and choose from.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|full of characters, magic and interesting storyline.  I highly recommend this book, especially if you like action, love interests and magic.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Mr Martin continues to keep me enthralled with the continual loyalty as well as ruthless scheming of his characters. It's amazing that we have come so far.  I do believe Mr Martin creates a very realistic picture of the mistreatment of the masses
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels is a very fun and challenging game. The different shaped puzzles makes if fun. I would give my friends this game anytime.
1475143389|5.0|I have been researching and reading and trying to make sense of this world of fitness. Until I found this book I really had no idea what I was doing.<br /><br />Mike has written a book that cements what you know into place, removes any misconceptions or 'broscience' you have been carrying around and provides real, practical and simple steps that you can follow. Mike has a great writing style that is clear and concise; he is able to explain some pretty complex concepts in a way that make it easy for you to understand.<br /><br />I am only starting out to achieve my fitness goals but I could not be happier that I have found this valuable resource to help guide me.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to any other newbies out there who are waiting to dip their toe into the world of fitness but are just too confused and overwhelmed to know where to begin.
B005FRF6PC|5.0|This is one HONEST athlete's account of his successes,<br />failures and demons. Who would have thought that the<br />brilliant Rafa has as many &#34;tics&#34; as the rest of us? The<br />depiction of the extraordinary Nadal family is inspiring.<br />VAMOS!
1439199388|5.0|This should be required reading for anybody thinking about having a child or already pregnant. Specifically, the chapter on autism (chapter 11) was quite revealing.  While we all know what is basically good and bad to do before or during pregnancy, after reading this I was left with a STRONG conviction to follow through because my child's life and quality of it depend on me more than I could ever imagine.<br /><br />Some of the larger, more complex questions about fixing society's autoimmune disorders are not necessarily answered because the science and research behind all of this is so new.  By understanding the questions, readers will be encouraged to learn more, scientists to research more, and people to do more to bring about healthier outcomes in our lives. No book has ever taken my breath away quite as much as this one, as it directly relates to my life and those of my children, including future generations.<br /><br />The book does an incredible job of synthesizing various studies. The bibliography alone is massive. After reading this book, I am convinced my child will be born healthier.
B003K15IF8|4.0|A good story.  Well written.  A little slow and a little predictable.  It was not a book that I would rush to read again even though it was a good story, it was a little depressing.  Life is hard enough, I guess I am looking for a take away from a book that gives me a little refreshment.
0765325950|4.0|That was a great ending. Honestly, this is the most well-written book of the series. Brandon Sanderson really took it as his own and ran with it. Once the battles get going, there is just not a single page lacking in action. I just really couldn't stop reading. Ok, but let's get down to business. Are there any flaws with this book? I would say there are two: One is that some of the story lines are wrapped up a little too quickly and neatly. I mean it's all battle battle battle and everything is hanging in the balance with the forces of light about to lose...and then so-and-so manages to kill so-and-so, except this happens more than two times. It's not bad, really, but  holding it all back until the very end meant that as a reader you started to feel like he was holding it all back until the end and just started to detract a little from the impressiveness. But hey, don't get me wrong, it was compelling all the way through. I seriously could not stop reading.<br /><br />The second drawback was that there really wasn't enough of an epilogue. It's not like RJ is going to write more, and anything Sanderson adds, while probably good and interesting, just won't be what RJ might have written, and thus won't ever feel as authentic (like the Dune series). I just can't get into that stuff which is essentially professionally written fan-fic. So I wish there'd been an ending chapter set a hundred years in the future, or a thousand, or something like that.<br /><br />Neither of these flaws seriously detracts from the book though. I think Sanderson is an excellent writer and I plan on reading more of his work now that I'm done with this (I've never read him before). The way the story was wrapped up was truly fitting and satisfying. I only now wish that I could go back in time and read it all for the first time again.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a great book. I would recommend it to friends. Also, I loved the writing style. Different from most books.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This is on of the best books I've every read and I'll be buying the movie too!  I just bought the kindle version too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great ending to a great series.  I initially thought this series was for the tween group, but after starting it, I finished all three books in less than two weeks, while working full time and taking college courses.  Very captivating and well written.  I hoping for another edition!!! Read the series you will enjoy!
B009FXIICK|4.0|This is a fast paced game, with each level becoming more of a challenge.  It is cute, and fun.  Great brain exercise too!
B001L83PLQ|1.0|This book is long, long, long, and boring.  I think the story line would have been better if the author cut out about 100 pages or so.  The story line was interesting, but the book was way to long getting to the main point.  A lot of unnecessary conversations and details!!!  I never stop reading a book prior to finishing it, this may be the first.  However, I was ready to move on to something else b/c the book was long and lacked luster.  I do enjoy reading long novels, read “The Help” in about three days over a long weekend, but the book should be interesting if it has this many pages.  Maybe I will finish it when I am stuck on an airplane with no entertainment.  Check it out from the library first, and if you like it, purchase a copy after reading it to support the author.  This is what I wish I had done before adding it to my e-book library.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Now I see why this was my sister's favorite book when we were young! Cute book. Glad I finally read it!
B008B3MZMY|4.0|I have been listening to this concert on cd for 30 years and find the dvd lacks the balance song wise. Great to see the band playing live and being able to understand who plays what, when and how!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|downloaded this app TWICE.  It brings up the menu briefly, then closes, and won't respond.  I do NOT recommend it.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|My husband and I love Bruce Springsteen and this album is great. It came really quickly and the only thing better would have been if I would have downloaded it. I am very happy with all of the CD's ordered from Amazon.
B000BNI90O|5.0|This is an awesome experience, and like the extended (and better) films gives you a much fuller, immersive experience. Howard Shore's music matches the epic journey taken by the Felliwship and its a pleasure to let the whole soundtrack play - its frankly brilliant.<br />I prefer this to the other extended collections; thus has a freshness, a lightness and then huge great clanking parts of the narrative. Blended skilfully the soundtrack becomes more an dependent adventure.<br />You may conclude from this that I rather like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|5 star's all the way<br />A must read before the movie , good good good good good good good book.....
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It took me a bit to get into this novel because it's told by the 5-year old boy.  But I found it to be uplifting and rewarding and a confirmation of parental love.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was one of G5' s better games. It was fairly involved for your typical mystery/hidden object apps. Would recommend it.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|not bad for free game. wish it was more of a dungeon crawled. wish it was more like number 4.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It really was slow at first but it began to get your attention when she started to tell her story. I would recommend this book.

B00A757EFW|2.0|I loved pac man as a kid but this app is just a teaser.  I barely got started then was cut off and asked to purchase.  Plus I found manuevering on a touch screen a little more difficult.  Call me old school lol
B004QX07G4|2.0|This book was very boring and redundant.  I never read any of Ellen's other books but I assume they were better than this one.
B009X01D9U|5.0|The leather is nice and smooth. The rotation hinge works well. It fits the kindle like it should. There's nothing I would change except lower price so I could get another color.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I purchased this movie because when I went to the theater to see it, it had me laughing hysterically and I just had to buy it.
B009GEDP26|5.0|This is my favorite program. It's ashamed I didn't know about it since last year. That's why I'm searching for the re-runs.. Good work from the producers and the whole cast. Congratulations!!!!!!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|The game really stinks. I love the regular angry birds, seasons and that but this one was really bad not fun at all to play.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can sit for hours and play this game. Wish I could do it while walking! those pigs and their grins ... makes me want to blow them up even more!!!
098555780X|4.0|Its very helpful to have around no one could ever remember all of those unless you do it for a living so its good to have<br />this book for review and instruction you never know when you will want to tie any of the knots that are in this book
0765325950|4.0|Characters have never been quite right since sanderson took over.A lot of them feel ccompletely different (aviendha, mat snd even rand at times). The point of views are all the same.<br />That being said I loved reading it and was entirely happy with it right up until the defeat of the dark one. It even made me cry in multiple places.<br />I had a feeling about min's pyre viewing but didn't like the way it paned out. I cannot believe rand would have it that way.<br />I dislike how main characters (aviendha, nyn, min, moiraine) took a back seat and were barely seen at all.<br />Over all I feel the battle (as epic as it was) had the depth of detail that over scenes and interactions needed, some of which we didn't get to see. Sanderson did the best he could, jordan's would have been better.
B0058BI896|5.0|read recently Seinfeld called &#34;funniest sitcom ever&#34; what a joke. It can't hold a candle to TBBT. No one on Seinfeld ever had to play as complex a person as Sheldon, Jim Parsons is unbelieveable, would love to know his real IQ.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I would recommend this book to both introverts and extroverts.  Introverts need to learn that they are okay and have strengths that extroverts do not have and to use those strengths rather than to try to be extraverts.  Whereas extraverts need to learn that introverts are not lesser beings, but have different gifts which can be used to great effect.  This is a book about how we got to the point that Extraversion is the ideal and anything else needs to learn to be extraverted.  It is very helpful to introverts to find their place in society and to extraverts to understand that there are all sorts of ways to do things and to be.  A person reading this book will come away with an understanding of personality and leadership styles and be better able to find themselves in the world.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|One of the best PvP RPG's that I have played on Kindle Fire. Gameloft is doing a great job! I wonder what else they will come out with.

B001HN6922|5.0|This movie is my baby niece's current obsession. Auntie did so well, that she didn't pay attention to anything else she got for Christmas.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|This movie is a must have, if you like fairytale stories.  Not recommended for little ones some parts can be viewed as scary
1606995359|5.0|The book is a hard back with the image printed on the cover, no dust jacket.  Very nice looking.  Over 200 pages of full color comics.  Good buy!
140053271X|5.0|A wonderful e-book - very easy navigation, high-quality screen, accurate assembly. Ekpluatiroval until not long, I hope that in time NOOK fails.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Full of sci-fi, time-travel and love story cliches? Sure. But very entertaining storytelling, and I was sad for it to end (even after so very many pages). I'm a big fan of King's early work, and this still holds up to some of my favorites.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was so funny and I love all the singing. Very talented people. Really good music in it too that I haven't heard in a while.

B007ZXK08C|5.0|A great story, plays with your sympathies for the two characters.<br />A very clever way of telling a story, thanks.
B007FEZQF8|3.0|Really enjoyed the art work, thought the story line flowed really well, thought it was a little over prices for the amount of material you are getting.
1465001107|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter who is a big Michael Jackson fan. She really liked it. It is now hanging in her room
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great tv series.  Needed this to catch up on show.  Clear picture and no glitches.  Will buy through this again.
0765325950|4.0|Most of the reviews I have read have focused on what the book lacks.  It was an ending and not everyone will be happy when a series ends.  However we as the fans have to be realistic.  The man died.  Nothing was going to be the same afterwards.  He made an amazing, detailed universe, with incredible characters.  What really angered me was the 1 star reviews from people mad that the book did not have a kindle version. You write a review based on the content of the book not based on whether or not it has an e-format.  Oh well.  I have a kindle and still bought the book.  I wanted a paper edition because I started reading this series in the early 1990s and that was 20 years ago and 4 jobs later.  Some people complained that their were too many characters.  I will agree with that only because we really did not get to read on what happened to them all.  This really could have been opened up to more authors and made into almost like a Thieves World or a Darkover or Witch World kind of series.  The author did opt for a Dune like ending for Rand.  I am sad to see the world end in fact I would have loved it if they would have extended it to another book.  I saw early on reading the series what the author was trying to do.  He was trying to give it all to the fans.  Flashing back and forth between major characters.  I loved the series and I loved the last book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting plot twists. Interesting approach where the two main characters alternate and tell the story in the first person.  If you like intrigue and twists and turns as the story progresses you'll like this novel.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show gets funnier and funnier every season.  Penny and Sheldon seem to be the scene stealers and Leonard the straightman. Can honestly say I getting addicted to this show.
0316044695|5.0|Bought this for a dear friend of mine for Christmas. He was really excited about it and I think has almost finished it. Can't wait to read it myself.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I am only allowing myself one new episode daily now. I have a soreness from laughing so much. Will ration it out until season 6 comes home to me. lol.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Enjoy great performances from Clint Eastwood, Justin Timberlake and Amy Edwards.  I am not particularly a baseball fan, but I enjoyed this movie very much.
B004IK8Q86|4.0|HAVE WANTED TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS FOR YEARS. CAPTURES A TIME IN HISTORY PERFECTLY AND THE JADED PEOPLE LIVING IN THE TWENTIES.
0765325950|5.0|This was a very fitting and satisfying end to a saga that was perhaps the most epic in scope since Tolkien. While the merits of Robert Jordan's style has been hotly debated, and the individual books have been received with varying enthusiasm, the importance of the series cannot be ignored.<br /><br />In A Memory of Light, fast rising author Brandon Sanderson does an admirable job of pulling together the overwhelming number of plot threads that Jordan wove through his masterwork. From the Dragon Reborn himself to the shaggy pony that accompanied him in the first chapter of the first book, we learn the fates of all the characters that have intrigued us, frustrated us, drawn our sympathy, and pulled us into their lush and complex world. While the story is brought to a close, enough mystery is left to remind the reader that there are truly no endings to the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />For fans like myself who have literally grown up along with the Wheel of Time and its cast of characters, this book is exciting, heart-rending, and satisfying, though more than a little bittersweet. I salute Brandon Sanderson for the passion and professionalism he brought to this beloved series, and I fondly  extend my thanks to Mr. Rigley, whose life work has rendered him truly immortal in literature.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|REREAD AND IT IS STILL A FASCINATING BOOK. LIKE A TRIP THROUGH TIME TO A PLACE WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Wes Anderson's still crankin out the good stuff.  By this point, you love him or hate him, let's face it.  Those that like Wes at ALL will love this movie - it's one of his best, in my opinion.  Well-scripted, acted, and shot, I thought it was a great addition to his growing body of quirky, heartfelt, humorous movies.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Gave me a whole new way to think about afterlife..I enjoyed this book.<br />she really had me from the get go.
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|I remember the first time I ever saw this movie, in my house, alone, on a friday night....the HD version on my big screen totally brought those feelings of dread back in high definition.  wow, one of the craziest movies, epic.
0670026603|5.0|This is the third book I've read by Moyes and I am in love with her stories. This particular story had it all; two people from two different worlds, love, loss, and understanding. I loved Louisa and I loved Will. I loved them together and I loved them apart, which I think is the love that Moyes was trying to create. I am so sad this story is over. Brilliant, just brilliant.
0345522478|4.0|I started this book feeling a bit underwhelmed. There are a whole lot of deities mentioned in this book along with shifters, the fae, vampires, druids, and witches. Whew! I was a bit bogged down with all of the people to remember and sort through. Honestly, if I hadn't read many UF books before, I would have been completely lost. It just didn't... grab me. I could have dropped the book in the first 50 pages. I also had a bit of trouble connecting with a male protagonist. And no romance to speak of?? However, as I read further and further, I started really enjoying myself. I got into a urban fantasy groove, so to speak.<br /><br />It is very hard not to fall in love with Atticus and Oberon. They have a sarcastic, pop culture-y, dry sense of humor that is very enjoyable to read. I loved their banter. And as the action picked up, I was pressing my nose to the pages (metaphorically!) to get further into the scenes. I began really really loving it. The end had a nice high energy zing and it left me excited to read more.
B009MO57H6|3.0|While the action in this movie was entertaining enough, I thought the movie as a whole wasn't exactly all that great.  I wasn't sure I liked the direction they took with this one, and the fact that they were battling in simulated sequences most of the movie was kind of annoying to me.  It's almost like the idea for this new movie was kinda forced and it seemed they were running out of ideas or something...yet once they go to 4 movies I guess they feel they have to turn it into 6.  I'll see the 6th movie once it comes around, but I'm not entirely excited about it...hoping at least that it's better than this one.  Some of the acting was mediocre at best too.  If you're into action, I'd still say give this a watch because it did have some good action but that's about all it's good for.  I think they should have ended it in Afterlife though.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game follows the last perfectly it has a lot of action and is the best kindle fire game I have. It also has a store so I can shop while shooting!
B004ZNACA6|5.0|It's a little pricy, sure...but if it's your favorite band than $100+ seems like a measely amount to own their whole complete discography in a cool collector's set, complete with a cool collectible book...at least if that band is an epic band such as Pink Floyd anyway.<br /><br />Such is the case with my wife...she's not like me where I have like 101 favorite bands.  She has her few absolute favorites, and Pink Floyd happens to be one of them!  I myself wouldn't call them an absolute favorite (I love classic rock & modern rock, but I'm a bigger fan of metal music), but I do enjoy their music, ever since I was a kid and I'd listen to them with my dad and even my grandpa.<br /><br />Being the big Pink Floyd fan that my wife is, it seemed a little sad to me that between the 2 of us we only had a few albums, so I took it upon myself to get her this set as a Christmas gift, because any big self respecting fan of any band ought to own the band's entire discography.  She absolutely loved it!<br /><br />She had not previously heard exactly every single solitary song that Pink Floyd had every put out, though she'd heard most, but after listening to each and every album straight through, she said she was in heaven!<br /><br />Such a cool set, and it meant the world to me to see her smile like she did with this set!  I have even sat down and listened to some of it with her and it's all brilliant!  If you are a Pink Floyd fan or just a classic rock fan in general and enjoy Pink Floyd, this is an awesome set to fork out for you if you have the coin.  Check it out!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Wow another excellent book and now with my new kindle i dont nrrd to turn a light on at night to read  this book ias as good as all of hers excellent read
B009MO5E10|4.0|Ok, let's face it...this is a movie that doesn't quite fall under the category of \\"epic\\" or \\"a masterpiece\\", but that being said, the movie was actually quite enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt is super cool in this movie, as he typically is in many of the movies he's in.  The rest of the cast wasn't too bad either.  LoL, the guy that plays Levitt's boss in the movie...I hadn't remembered seeing him since the 2nd Spiderman movie, the pizza shop owner Parker worked for.  Good times.<br /><br />Anyway, I won't waste any time going into detail about the premis of the movie, as you can just as easily see that in some other reviews or on the movie's main page, and I certainly won't spoil anything for any of you.  All I'll say is that the movie contains some thrilling bicycle chases (I felt so bad for the bicycle cop, LoL...those who've seen the movie know what I'm talking about), and there is some good humor in it too.<br /><br />One thing's for sure, I don't think I could do what Levitt and some of these other couriers do in the film, least of all in New York City, but it sure makes for an exciting movie.  Definitely give this one a watch folks!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this is a great game  it is entertaining and addicting and you dont have to spend any money what more could you ask for
B005LAII12|4.0|Though noteably crass in a few parts and involves some drug content (yes parents, I am saying you should not let your kids watch this), this movie was funny and heart felt.<br /><br />Mark Whalberg and Mila Kunis were great in the movie, and Seth McFarland did a wonderful job voicing Ted (I mean, of course he did...he's created Family Guy and voiced many of the characters on it).  It was awesome seeing Flash Gordon in it too, LoL.<br /><br />Rather funny movie.  This one guy and his kid that are after Ted...a little creepy, but added to both the humor and suspense in the movie.  Good morale about the value of true friendship.  Although there are comedies I like better, this apple certainly doesn't fall far from that tree!  If you love comedy and don't mind a bit of crudeness, then I highly recommend giving this movie a watch!  It's worthwhile!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I would. Definitely<br /> recommend this app to all friends. There is some challenge, but not so much you get frustrated.

1584233494|5.0|My boyfriend is a Shepard Fairey fan so this looked like a promising Christmas gift. I wasn't sure I was going to get this at first because I thought it might be cheesey but I read the reviews and they were all positive. I received it on time before Christmas, like promised and wrapped it in the Amazon box it came in so he wouldn't have a clue what it could be. Once he opened it, he was so excited becuase he had read about the book but had not been able to see it in person. He couldn't / can't put it down. He's a graphic designer and is always sketching and creating so this book is another source of inspiration for him and he loves that it's not just photos of Shepard Fairey's work but a lot of back stories behind each piece. The book's a great addition to our growing library of art books and even looks great on our coffee table, if he hasn't taken it with him to another room in our apt. Haha!  Also, a great conversation starter! This turned out to be a better gift than expected!
B00000ITOY|5.0|Came in very fast time well packaged and a great nontoxic toy that my son whose two loves thanks :)

B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Interesting twist on one of my favorite stories.  The updated characters are good and I look forward to more episodes.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these when I received a noise complaint from a neighbor, as I was trying to enjoy some music in the next room. With these, I can have it as loud as I want, do what I need to anywhere in my apartment, and not disturb anyone. Perfect for my needs!<br /><br />As to gaming, the sound quality is outstanding, and the surround effect is exquisite. I don't use the microphone, so I have no opinion on this. I will modify this review if this changes.<br /><br />A minor note: Battery life claims 10 hours, but I find that if I am listening to music at higher volume that life drops down to about 4. Just something to keep in the back of your mind, if that is your purpose for this purchase....
B002XISFGS|5.0|This is the best trek movie ever done . Very realistic plot and stunning sets. I only wish the special longer version was available as well.

B0055PGUYU|2.0|I am always looking for ways to improve myself personally, I am pastor for 16 years. I did not review the book before buying it, as always my custom. I found this book very difficult to understand for me too many explanations before you reach the point. Considered unnecessary so much explanation that instead of helping me confuses me.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|In some regards, this is one of the best reads I've read in years. On the other hand, it is heart wrenching to comprehend what these girls/women went through. Superman, Spiderman, and batman are not superheroes...Jaycee and her family are the epitome of heroic. Hope their story just keeps getting better from here!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book was great but I was lead up to a finale that did not happen! I was expecting more of a battle that lead to President Snow death oppose to a capture and execution! Since the story was so strongly built around the love triangle meaning Katniss having to pick between Gale and Peeta, I would have rather the ending being either Gale or Peeta sacrificing themself in order to kill Snow to save Katniss that way there would only be one to choose. Just the whole Gal in District two and us not knowing what was going on with him in his new life and Peeta back in twelve with Katniss and them just having there life and living happily ever after, it was to clean and fairy tail like for me. And I would have liked to read a better strategy, more war-like on Katniss plan to \\"rebel\\" against Coin as well! But overall a great book, a great trilogy I would most definitely recommend it!
B000067FP8|5.0|I was impressed with the price and it shipped quickly, It showed up in great shape, and it is in better condition  than I expected. works quite well, I will definitely Do business with this place again.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of one direction. And I thought that the book was really good. I felt like they were talking to me. It was over all a great book.

B008ZOHCKE|4.0|This app is nice, I love how you can have multiple journals and design anyway you want. I would love it even more if it was more organizational and allowed me to see how many entries i have in a simple way. Others wise it is the best writing app i have run into so far and is very useful.

B001ZG4J00|5.0|Rodriguez is Bob Dylan with a great voice.  Discovered him after seeing the wonderful movie &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;.  Finally America is giving him the recognition that is long overdue.
B003Y5HWK4|1.0|We could not even finish the first episode due to the full nudity and full vivid sex scenes.  This will be going in the garbage.  What a waste of money!!!!
1400067820|5.0|I had read The Black Swan and it helps with some of the references presented by the author. By-the-way, the author certainly has read widely quoting a plethora of sources that help make his point. This is not an easy read; this is a life-study text. Fragile-Robust-Antifragile, are his terms describing domains in which we live, the latter being the most enduring, and that which should be sought by thinking outside conventional boundaries of statistics. Micro-evolution in nature is anti-fragile by the author's definition. It allows random events, over TIME [an important factor in antifragile thinking], to improve--in most systems, perhaps all. The author does not like pure statistics because the of flawed interpretation--only partial data is available and without an extremely large data base and corresponding very long time, random and catastrophic events in any system are not presented. The effect of that negative is usually unexpectedly severe. Highly recommended for young people who want to tinker [randomness] instead of follow a prescribed scientific corporate protocol. The school of hard knocks, common sense, experimentation, vision all play a part in this presentation.  Larry Fischer

0988262592|5.0|The IT world has been waiting for a book like this for years! Fans of Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt's \\"The Goal\\" will find familiar themes of applying the Theory of Constraints to the IT function. I could not put this book down once I picked it up, and have now read it twice (both times in a couple of days). I found a number of key concepts for additional learning (like the art and science of designing and operating Kanban boards) that I would not have otherwise found.<br /><br />Just like The Goal is required reading for MBA students, The Phoenix Project should be required reading for both those earning an advanced degree in an IT discipline and those managing some part of an IT function in their company. IT departments that don't change will surely be left behind other companies with high-functioning IT arms as they become more and more critical to the daily operation and growth of the business.<br /><br />If you are ready to make the transition into a high-functioning IT operations powerhouse, than this is the book for you!
030758836X|2.0|Clearly the author has talent and has prepared an intricate plot that will suck you in, but in the end, I just felt like I needed a bath.  This is a novel about sick people living out sick and even criminal acts.  Not my cup of tea.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|Another superb Kurt Wallander mystery with a surprising twist at the end.  Mankell's humanistic, deeply intellectual style is unusual in thrillers and a joy to read.  The character development is so good, the reader feels like the protagonists are close friends.  Mankell is heads above other mystery writers.  I highly recommend all of his books!<br /><br />-ec
0765325950|1.0|I am very concerned about the decision to not publish an eBook.<br /><br />The author & publisher asserting that Jordan's wife made the call seems to me to be passing the buck at some level.<br /><br />I am currently listening to this on audio and it is very odd indeed since I have evidently pronounced just about every single word incorrectly!<br /><br />Sad to see it end with a bad taste in my ears...
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I'm no audiophile but I love this album.  I had heard Mumford & Sons a few times via friends and just took a chance on the album.  It's great.  I don't skip any songs (which says a lot for the other albums I've got) so it's definitely excellent.  I'll probably end up buying their older albums now too!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A testament to the resiliency of this young woman who never gave up hope that she would one day be reunited with her family. She gives herself to all who read her story, and it is a gift. I hadn't thought about how difficult it is to reintegrate into society and Jaycee describes this process too.
B009X01D9U|5.0|After hours of shopping for a case for the kindle I got for my girlfriend I couldn't be happier. The case is extremely versatile. The developers really thought of everything from cutting out slots for the speakers to the rotating insert so you can charge it while it is closed. Well done!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I bought this case as a &#34;just in case&#34; for my iPhone, then purchased a cute case to use all the time. Well, the cute case wasn't sturdy - and I wasn't going to trust my expensive phone to something that I couldn't rely on. This cheapy, rubbery wonder has been on my phone nearly a year now. I love it. I've dropped my phone - more than once - and this case has kept it safe. I put a little picture between the case and the phone, so I &#34;personalized&#34; it on the cheap.<br /><br />There are more expensive cases on the market - they're bigger, have a better brand name - but I guarantee this works just as well.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Takes you back to the movie which is incredible!  It lets you keep and feel the emotions over and over.
0345803485|5.0|I found it a great read of erotica. My only critique was Ana needed to believe more in herself and the many sexual episodes in one day seem unrealistic but it was difficult to put this book down and very motivating to purchase the trilogy.  You get what you want out f this book!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Keeps you spell bound from beginning to end, but for the history buff, there is more attention to the personal story and much less to the historical details than book 1.  This was the only disappointment.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The 1st case was defective.  No response from lifeproof when I emailed for help.  I returned it to the store for a refund.<br /><br />The 2nd case is broken right out of the box!  It is going back too so I can buy another product.  I'm done with lifeproof cases.<br /><br />$70 for a cheesy plastic case that should cost $15 and beware, it only has a 90 day warranty!<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!
B0080CL0HM|4.0|great movie and actors. the cinematography was beautiful as well. i absolutely love period pieces to begin with in the first place
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics blew me away on this game. It also includes a interesting twist in the story that is enhanced by the background music.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love this album!  &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; drew me to buy it, and the version on the CD with Nicky Minaj is fabulous.  I really like several songs on it.  I also like her little prelude at the beginning - just beautiful.  What an artist.

B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book, peaked my curiosity and made me want to keep reading. Disturbing topic and unusual plot twists.<br />I would definitely recommend it.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I bought this item about a month ago. It arrived in 1 day, so the shipping is superfast. It looks awesome In the packaging and really great on a display. It was sealed in the box and only lower left bottom of the back corner was dinged. It was one of the last ones they had. I am envy of some people in Augusta since they are now sold out. I smile every time I look at it at my movie shelf. In the eye of a collector it is priceless. The piece is one of a kind and well worth getting...:)
B005IQZB14|4.0|Very inspiring!! I would love to do something like this some day. I wish she had said more about her life after she was done hiking, but it still didn't take away from the rest of the book.

1419705849|5.0|This was the last in the series that I had purchased for my grandson.  He has read and re-read all of them.  He is only eight so I was concerned that the material was over his head but he really enjoyed them.

B002B55XGI|3.0|Sent to me by mistake by the vendor.  They have a restocking fee so I did not return it.  It has never been opened.  A lesson learned.
B000MV8XPG|2.0|Directions for putting this together were terrible.  No instructions, only pictures. For what I paid for this, I hope it holds up.  Only time will tell. I bought it for my 3 year old grandson and it is in doors so far but when it goes outdoors in the spring it probably will not be able to take the harder wear and tear.  I think the price should have been about half of what it was.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A quick read that keeps you interested throughout its entirety. I would recommend it to anyone, it's a good steal for the price.

0765325950|1.0|I was so looking forward to the Jan 8th release date, and am very disappointed to find the out about the delayed Kindle release date now... missed that detail at first. Since I've been reading ebooks only for years, I will not play this publisher's greedy game and buy the hardcover version. In 2013 one should expect a simultaneous ebook release by default.<br /><br />In the future, I will think very hard about purchasing another book from Tor.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a great series. Good read while I'm deployed! Can't wait to see what else this author has. Definitely a huge fan!
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I loved this app when I first installed it to my kindle, I would use it daily, but now it wont open. I'll just stick with using this app on my phone. Such a shame.

B007PKDW44|5.0|Great album.  Volbeat has a fresh rocking sound that is a bit edgy with good lyrics that you can actually understand.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This item was bought as a gift, and although it contains six movies, it will fit nicely on a small DVD/Blu-ray stand since it is so compact.
B008NMT684|4.0|I like the app, but wish you could get into the other puzzles without an in- app purchase.  Kids really like popping the balloons, though
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My friends got me on to this series last summer. I bought myself the box set for Christmas. It is written really well, and very captivating. It won't let you down. I promise.
B0041KXY1M|4.0|Only problem is that this version has subtitles only in Italian, causes occasional difficulty in following words. Performances are excellent
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is an excellent step by step description of how a investigation builds with his usual descriptive flair.<br />There is certainly a building dramatic crescendo that while fun to read was almost superfluous to me.<br />He certainly has continued his series of successess.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Amazon refunded our charge so I have no complaint.  The film was entertaining and creative.<br />We had transmission problems with constant loading and freezing, also poor visual quality. Otherwise, I would have given the film a higher rating.
0375869026|5.0|My 4th graders teacher read this to her class. My son and other students loved it. I purchased it for our family for Christmas. I read it in 2 days. It was amazing. Well written. The characters were well developed and I loved the point of view used by the author. Highly inspirational. Great read for all ages, young and old.
B002GHHHME|4.0|Typical Arnold! &#34;I'll b back!&#34; enjoyed the movie an it was in excellent condition when it arrived. A great addition to my library....an highly recommended to other Amazon customers
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie then noticed during the credits that it was based on a book. Even though the two were different slightly, I enjoyed them both immensely and recommend them highly. They really give you an inside look at what it must be like to have mental challenges.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I down loaded this game for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She absolutely loves it and quickly caught on how to play.  I, on the other hand, am not very good at playing it but I don't play hardly any games.  It is fun to watch her play and the graphics are great on the Kindle Fire HD.
B000JQUKKU|4.0|Very well developed characters and fabulous description make Mr. Dickens such a great writer. Well worth the time on a cold winter night.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|The book was excellent it got very long at times to where is got boreing but the character and the details felt as if I was in the land of OZ myself
0812984412|4.0|An enjoyable read, Michell is adept at various sorts of voices. The sections don't seem to have much to do with one another until the end, where all is tied together. Only four stars because at the end I didn't feel a great deal of emotional connection with the characters, but it kept me reading until the end.
B001D84NKQ|5.0|If you love this movie, you will love this soundtrack.Listening to it brings memories of  all those special moments in the film.

B008JLEUD0|5.0|I first saw Fatou at Shakori Hills Grassroots Music Festival in NC and she was an incredibly performer and singer.  I hesitantly ordered the CD because lots of times, music is completely different live and on a CD.  I wasn't disappointed!  Lyrics are offered in the booklet in English and French.  The only thing that makes it better is knowing what she is singing about - she is obviously a strong independent woman.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Came on time and it was like new thus I was even more pleased. I will be ordering more DVDs
B007X4N0DU|1.0|I'm going to tell you a story about P.O.D.  I was living in Seattle around 2007 or 2008.  I picked up this very cute hooker working on Pacific Highway South around 240th street.  We went back to my hotel.  She was 20 years old, and very cute.  Let's forget about my history and my struggles for a moment because I don't feel like getting into it.  To make a long story short, I asked her what the most money she ever made in one night was.  She said this band in Las Vegas picked up her and another girl, and they split $60,000 when the left in the morning.  She said they had a safe in the room with stacks of money in it.  I asked her what the name of the band was, and she said, \\"Some band named P.O.D.\\".<br /><br />I said, \\"P.O.D., they're suppossed to be a Christian band\\".<br /><br />She said, \\"Well we never heard of them, but we were just lucky\\".<br /><br />I then asked her what she did with the $30,000, and she said she bought a car with it, but that she had to get it changed into a check first because people would be suspicious of how she got the money if she didn't.  She knew some people in Las Vegas that could do that for her.<br /><br />So, there's your band POD in action in Las Vegas after the concert I guess--or maybe they just flew out there to have a good time.  I was watching a special on TV tonight about the band Creed.  A lot of people believed they were a Christian band, but they weren't.  The lead singer did eventually get saved though and then he left the band.  His lifestyle, lyrics and his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ was not compatible with the rest of the band.

B001AUEMFS|4.0|I really enjoy their music and this album did not disappoint. I think I got a free download of it so that was even better.
B005HGKW00|3.0|Good costumes, but historically inaccurate. Protrays Surrant is a very bad light without taking into account Confederate views. Surrant may have very well been framed.
B00A8LYYI0|1.0|First off, I was waiting so long for this movie. Saw the first, and thought it was increadible. First movie was great because it spun off into it's own original story.<br />Then came the second movie. I heard it was a different director, but being a hardcore Silent Hill fan, it was my sole duty to see it, and it failed to deliver.<br />This new director tried to take the story that left off from the first movie, and shoved the whole story of Silent Hill 3 in. It turned out to be an amateur mess. Things didn't make any sense, the visuals were pretty bad, (relying compleatly on SGI) and the infamous Pyramid Head was thrown in for the ultimate fan service.<br />I can't really say much more without giving everything away, if there is anything worth giving. As an artist, an appreciator of originality, and a huge fan of what Silent Hill is truely supossed to be, I have to give this movie 1 star.
B00101ZOTA|2.0|violence with too much bad language.  the story is good, but you have to get through a lot of junk to get to it
B005GFPZYK|3.0|American Sniper was a good, gripping book with lots of fascinating details from the perspective of a Navy sniper.<br /><br />This would have to be best suited to someone looking towards joining the military, but anyone with an interest in the armed forces and/or war would find the story of Chris Kyle enjoyable.<br /><br />It is a very easy read and will grab you from page one.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that it's dripping with chest-beating bravado about fighting and killing that probably could have benefitted from a bit more humility.<br /><br />But apart from that, the insights into the thoughts of a seasoned Navy sniper at the coalface of the Iraq war -- and even his critiques of some of the American military's broader policies/strategies during the war -- make for compelling reading.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game really shines on the Note and Note 2 by Samsung. You can use the s-pen to draw. The game is fun and includes a bit of a puzzle aspect along with a little action. I didn't think we were to the point in technology where you could draw something and have it interact within the game but here we are.
B0023SDQB2|4.0|Read it due to a recommendation from my son, an English teacher.  I was half way thru it when I happened to look it up on Wikipedia and I was somewhat surprised to find the author is a woman.  It seemed like it was written by a man. I enjoyed reading it and the historical perspective of the attitudes towards returning to combat and &#34;duty&#34; we're very interesting.  I will probably read the rest of the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|'Gone Girl' is a mystery that will have the reader in suspense till the end and beyond. With each twist and turn of the story, it is hard to tell which character is the 'good guy' or the 'bad guy'.  The story will keep the reader thinking about the characters and about marriage relationships long after the story ends.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story was clever and convoluted.  Don't want to give away the ending, but didn't like the way it ended, where is the justice?
0765325950|5.0|Just finished this novel today and I have to say, after a few hours reflecting on it, I think Sanderson did a fine job wrapping up Jordan's vision.  Are there flaws?  Yes.  Are there differences in style?  Yes.  Is this one of the best novels I've ever read?  YES.<br /><br />Because the feat should have been impossible.  Thousands and thousands of pages of multiple storylines and arcs, hundreds of characters, and the pressure of the expectations of millions weighing down on Team Jordan; more than several mountains to be burdened simultaneously.<br /><br />I won't go into details, because I believe you should read this book yourself and weigh your own opinions.  I can say that I'm extremely satisfied.  I will say this, the 200-page, 79,000 word count, 30+ PoV chapter featured in this book was one of the most riveting things I've ever read.<br /><br />Also, giving one-star ratings over no ebook is sad; a true fan would buy a copy regardless to finish the journey.  Stop complaining, get off your couch and actually get a copy and read the story and RATE THAT - the story itself.  You have the rest of your life to pick up a digital copy.<br /><br />I smirk knowing I see the Pattern's final weaves while the rest of you mope on floor, like kittens, swatting at yarn.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is easy to see and use.its very much like a real one<br />it is not over thought or overworked
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Love Lipton's analogies - everything makes sense.  The technical side is made easy by his matter-of-fact delivery.  I'm already heading for the sequel.
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Boring, predictable, derivative. Definitely Fi but little Sci! Can't believe there will be a sequel(s). May be worth watching on a plane if it's free and you have trouble sleeping. Probably cheaper than Ambien though!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I knew this was a best seller, but I knew nothing about the story.  What a great surprise.  It was the best story I have read in years.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Faithful to the source<br /><br />I'm mainly writing this review in order to regain some of the product's footing after a slew of one star reviews given by people who seem to have somehow confused this film with Christopher Nolan's, \\"THE DARK KNIGHT RISES.\\" It just so happens that this movie is fantastic in its own right and deserves the accolades given by the more knowledgeable viewers.<br /><br />Many of the negative reviews I've read have mentioned that they were \\"duped\\" or \\"ripped off\\" by Amazon for releasing this stellar animated feature from Warner Brothers. Ok, I understand that they have the same distributor and you might not be the biggest fan of Gotham's most famous vigilante, but surely you would have read the product description, yeah? I mean unless you've been living under a rock the size of Uluru, you would've at least glanced the box art and realised that that was indeed not Christian Bale on the cover juxtaposed with an incendiary bat symbol from one of the most ubiquitous movie posters of the last decade. You of course noticed that Peter Weller was not the actor you expected to see fighting Bane (who's not credited on this blu ray) alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and that you'd never heard of a director named Jay Oliva. Right?<br /><br />However, if you used your super sleuthing skills to come to the conclusion that a film titled \\"THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS\\" is just that and no more, then you're in for a treat. The movie itself is a great adaptation of a very special graphic novel by the talented Frank Miller. It holds true to the theme of the original 80s manuscript and lends itself to cinematic interpretation. Unlike a lot of \\"graphic novels\\" that are actually collections of a comic book's natural and lengthy story cycle, Miller's story was originally intended to be a singular story with a strong and narrow focus. This helps avoid the pitfalls that other comic-based stories tend to have, where it's just one guest appearance/mindless action romp/plot jump after another. This picture is a honed and self-motivating piece that attempts to explain how Bruce Wayne is more Batman than Bruce Wayne. It's a great theme to run with and I think it pulls it off. I might have liked to see at least a hint of Batman's internal monologue as it was portrayed in the book, but I'm aware that film is a different animal to literature and some hard decisions had to be made.<br /><br />If you are a person who has dabbled in Warner Brother's other DC universe animated outings, then I would put this above the much-loved BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD (which I too enjoyed, if that gives you any reference) and even BATMAN: YEAR ONE (another Miller-penned gem).<br /><br />If you came to see THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, I think you'll be delighted with the quality of animation and respect that this release has given to its source material. If you're here to see THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, you might want to learn how to read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is more fun than it first appears to be.  it is totally addictive and the higher levels really make you think!
0670023329|5.0|This book is amazing. A must read for any dystopian fiction fan. At times I laughed, cried, and turned the page in anticipation. Read it and encourage others to do so. So the plight of the 200,000 in the labor camps can be exposed.

1612183956|5.0|Never having heard anything about the author Crouch, I just downloaded the book for 99 cent; hoping for solid material to read for the next ten or twelve days. Well, actually I read Pines in one day (and the wee hours of the next morning) without evergot a real chance to lay it down ( or in this case, to  switch the kindle off).<br />However,  this is exactly the point about writing a proper review about Pines without being a spoiler.  But to give you something  to start on, here's a short outline.<br />Ethan Burke, a middle aged secret service agent  with combat experience in second Gulf war  is  sent to the little town of Wayward Pines to investigate the disappearance of two fellow officers.  On his way, he gets involved in a severe traffic accident, which leaves his partner fatally injured and him in a critical condition. He wakes up in a hospital bed in Wayward Pines and remembers only fragments of his past while everybody around him seems to have something to hide. Ethan tries to learn about more the whereabouts of his missing colleagues and is eventually  confronted with a truth which he would have never imagined in any way .<br />Crouch storytelling talent is remarkable. In a dense, vivid language the author developes a story which not only holds supense and thrill till the very last minute but creates a genre of its own.<br />­­­­­If he is able to hold the standard he has set with Pines,we can expect more extraordinary novels.
B009VB97EY|1.0|How many times can you gratuitously use the F-bomb?  Just watch this flick and count them in the first ten minutes.  My dog doesn't have enough fleas to match that number.  Somebody just needed work and somebody should have just given them a check and saved all of the overhead.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a great second in the series can't wait to start the last book. There is a shocking twist.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I like the two perspectives from the book. All the characters are flawed in some way and I loved reading people's rationalizations for their mistakes or inefficiencies. The author's description of each scene was so detailed I felt like I was in Missouri living in that small, rundown town.

0765325950|5.0|I am thrilled to have the final volume of the Wheel of Time in my hands. I am a huge fan and have the entire series both in hard copy and on my kindle. The question I have now is: Where is the Kindle edition? There is not even an option to request it. I commute on the \\"L\\" where I do much of my reading. Do I want to sit there with a 900 page tome on my lap, or do I want to read this on my Kindle or phone? This really is a rhetorical question. So, where is that Kindle edition? True fans and collectors will always have both the electronic and hard copy, so please....
B009JBZH54|5.0|this is a great franchise!! the box set for the price was outstanding!!  blu ray is the way to go
B001ANSSDC|1.0|i really, really hated this book.  There was nobody in the novel i could even like.  What was the father's problem?  The two leading caracters were not likeable and the story was not interesting.  How this ever was made into a movie I will never know.  What a total waste of time reading this book was.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|this is a great movie and its fun to watch and keeps you interested the whole way through.  Must watch movie.

B005LAII80|5.0|What a fantastic film! I can't believe this movie flopped at the box office. Every time you think the story is going to become cliche it switches things up. What a fresh and unique take on what an action film should be. Highly recommend you check it out.

B0027MJU00|4.0|hard to put down, a great mystery from a strange family of characters, I would recommend it to a friend.
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|I know this movie looks kinda dumb but the only reason I wanted to see it was because of JGL I absolutley loved him in Looper! Movie is worth watching! Great actors and has a sence of humor.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|as described.  happy purchaser!<br />like the elastic band to secure the cover, and the plastic clip in corners.<br />even holds a stylus at the spine when closed.
B003ASLJO0|3.0|Loved the movie but the closed captioning did not work so I tough it out when I watch this film.  This is the second DVD that was sent out because the first one would not load or play and I kept getting the message of error on disc.
B00280LYHS|5.0|What a captivating book! I loved the funny chapter titles;they made me want to read on. But I owe it all to my two best  friends who urged me to read the series. I love them so much!

B008FYZIVY|4.0|The program is fabulous, of course.  The DVD, however, was not perfect.  There were areas where it went black and then jumped ahead.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|muy buena musica, excelente para jovenes, tiene buenos mensajes, mis hijas están encantadas y lo bailan bastante, lo recomiendo. muy bueno
B0083P1QUM|3.0|As usual, Cornwell gives a lot of great technical information. Her research is top-rate. The plot and the characterization are a bit of a reach, though. There  is at least one red herring left out there.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was interesting to read the work of L. Frank Baum and compare it to the movie.  As I read the book, I pictured the characters as they appeared in the movie.  This book would appeal to children and anyone who enjoys reading the books that popular movies are based on.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This one grabs you and takes you through many twists and turns as far as who's working whom.  A very good read but pretty hopeless when it comes to the human condition.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|If you are a Rush fan and love 2112, then this is a must have.  Now you can take the 2112 experience even further.  The pictures, the comic book and the bonus tracks.  I am very happy with my purchase.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A support group for Terminal illnesses links a couple of teenagers, a friend, and their families. Sometimes sad, sometimes witty and funny. These teenagers are readers, they are smart, they know they are not alone in their weirdness. They are dying, or will be soon. The novel is about the dreams they have, and trying to achieve them before they get too weak to seek them. With a fair share of misfortunes and parents who hold on to them desperately., they manage to break free, to live one last adventure.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Yes there are definitely beautiful colors and light and landscapes and locations in this movie. And fortunately there is much more to enjoy in this movie than just the amazing visuals.<br /><br />The movie shows us a broken-hearted stuntman Roy that finds himself utterly dispirited while he is hospitalized because he was injured after a fall, or maybe because he might also feel suicidal. In this hospital, set in the 1920s, he meets the 6-year old girl Alexandria, also hospitalized there.<br />This meeting enlivens him somewhat and he gradually begins to tell her a story which sort of grows into an epic.<br />We hear what he tells her and we see how she pictures it.<br /><br />The interaction between Roy and Alexandria is the living heart of this movie and is plainly endearing - so real and natural.<br /><br />The Epic is interrupted with happenings in the hospital, most of which make more sense than it seems at first sight.<br />The story of the Epic is a bit simple and at first I found the motivations of the main characters shallow or flawed - but when it dawned that the Epic is Roy's story (and not a story standing on its own) then all happened to fit seamlessly. It is not the bones of the story that makes it so appealing but the flesh on them (which reveals the inner life of the story-teller).<br />You will come to share Alexandria's curiosity how it will develop. The last 15 minutes of the Epic are truly intense and heartbreaking.<br /><br />This movie appears to be not only psychologically sound (concerning the inner dynamics of Roy and Alexandria) but it is (for me) also indisputably an authentic artistic achievement, displaying a memorable and intense catharsis.<br /><br />I cannot help finding myself to admire 'The fall' in so many ways.<br />This movie is a real flower. Sincere thanks to Tarsem for the creative efforts!

B00933JF74|5.0|There's a lot of town building games on phones now but most of them focus more on fighting opponents and gaining your money through coins. Thankfully this game has none of that. If you've ever played Tropico I'd say this is an easier medieval times version. No need to build up an army and go to war with anyone. Just make your townspeople happy with clothes, food, water, and other desirable additions.<br /><br />My only \\"complaint\\" would be that in the free version I was able to build a hunter's cabin but now in the premium it's no where to be found. Did I miss something here?<br /><br />Edited 4/17/13: In the last update the hunter's house has been added to the full version. Cheers!

0988262592|5.0|This book should be mandatory reading for business and IT graduates.<br /><br />In today's business environment, IT is involved in almost everything we do.  The challenge is that the non-technical parts of the business often don't understand the linkages, and the result is IT getting the short end of the stick.  The Phoenix Project is a captivating read, filled with valuable business and technology management techniques, presented in the form of a novel.<br /><br />Don't let the fact that this is a novel fool you - this is not fluff, and there is plenty of rich learning in this book. If you've ever read [[ASIN:0884271951 The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement]] by Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt, you'll know that it was a business novel designed to make it easier to understand his \\"Theory of Constraints\\" (TOC) model and it succeeded in making a lot of very complex concepts approachable for business seeking to improve the performance of their manufacturing and supply chain operations.<br /><br />The Phoenix Project is a lot like The Goal, in that it wraps a compelling story around such complex topics of DevOps, ITIL, Agile development processes, risk management, top-down risk-based audit scoping, and a lot more.<br /><br />The principles shared in this book are critical for any business that relies on IT for its livelihood.  Grab a copy and find out how much better your business can be.<br /><br />You can see my full review at genuinecuriosity.com/phoenix
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Cute game so far not to far into it yet(level7). But my daughter and I have a lot of fun with this one!
B008N9AASC|1.0|Influenced by the 4 and 5 star reviews, we decided to watch this last night.<br />Yes, there is some cinematography that is beautiful but overall we found the film to be quite depressing.  There is plenty of film capturing the destitution of poverty, the mind-numbing hours of factory work, and the horrors of factory farming.  Lots of close-up shots of faces staring into the camera with little or no affect at all.<br />Perhaps their message was that it isn't a very good place, our planet, to have to reincarnate into again and again - if so, then they did a good job conveying their belief and perception to their viewers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read her Gregor the Overlander books and I was even more thrilled with The Hunger Games. It puts action, survival and romance all in one.
B000WDROYK|5.0|This is tense and riveting drama with great performances all around.  It has several plot twists that will keep you guessing throughout.  A great movie....
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I'm early in the process of using what I've read in Mike Matthew's book. So far, so good. Best part is a basic plan that is easier to follow. Seems like a lot of common sense and knowledge of what actually works. Time will tell.

0765325950|3.0|Brandon Sanderson's \\"A Memory of Light\\" is an ending to the Wheel of Time series.  To blatantly borrow and paraphrase, it is not a great ending, it is not a horrific ending, but it is an ending.  While Sanderson should be commended for his willingness to devote 5 years of work on the near-impossible task of cleaning up Jordan's mess, many of the self-inflicted writing issues prevalent in his previous efforts continue in this book.  Furthermore, his decision to separate Jordan's planned single final volume into three books rather than two now appears questionable.  3 stars.<br /><br />Harriet McDougal's choice of hiring another author to finish the Wheel of Time series was a generous gift to fans, and Brandon Sanderson deserves a lot of credit for signing on.  The incredible mess that Jordan left behind would have been difficult for anyone to finish, and the fact that Sanderson did so, and did so generally on schedule, is a testament to his skill as a prolific writer.<br /><br />Sanderson's first book, \\"[[ASIN:1841492329 The Gathering Storm\\"]], provided great hope as it was probably the best of the series since [[ASIN:0812513746 \\"Fires of Heaven\\"]] over ten years earlier.  [[ASIN:B0074CTYNQ \\"Towers of Midnight\\"]] (ToM) wasn't awful, but clearly dropped off in quality as both plot progression and character writing showed cracks.  Many fans had anticipated that ToM was merely going to be the \\"[[ASIN:0618153993 Two Towers]]\\" equivalent of the final trilogy of the Wheel of Time.  The book might not have been as strong as its predecessor, but by moving characters around and tying up loose ends it would serve a necessary purpose in clearing the deck for a spectacular ending.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this hope isn't realized as \\"A Memory of Light\\" ends up far closer in quality to \\"Towers of Midnight\\" than \\"The Gathering Storm\\".  There are four main areas of difficulty.<br /><br />First, A Memory of Light consists almost entirely of various incarnations of the Last Battle.Any book filled with continuous combat faces high hurdles, let alone one spanning well over 800 pages.  Very few writers can pull off even a few hundred pages of battle sequences without things wearing quite thin; had Jordan remained alive, even someone with his combination of knowledge of swordsmanship and medieval army tactics, real-world military experience, and vividly descriptive writing might have had difficulty.  Sanderson is a reasonably good combat writer, but the overload of nearly identical sequences in different places at times makes for repetitive reading.<br /><br />What's more problematic is how he chooses to wrap up some characters and plot lines.  The denouement of some fairly significant characters who have received a combined thousands of pages of writing comes in as little as two sentences, and this adds on to the continuation of a loss of sharpness of character writing - much like going from Bluray to VHS - that was prevalent in ToM.  Sanderson also makes the strange decision to repeatedly involve previously minor characters in important plot lines while bumping numerous well established characters to near-cameo roles.<br /><br />Plot, too, becomes an issue.  While most main plot points are wrapped up, this often comes rather abruptly; some fans will find problems with a number of major mysteries that have lasted for years being resolved almost as an afterthought.  Much as in ToM, some other, larger plotlines don't get explored much; one entire army has its potentially fascinating culture nearly ignored, and any number of other mysteries that have taken up hundreds of pages in Jordan's books end up getting a couple of paragraphs to end them while others don't get fully answered whatsoever.  Some of this may have been necessary just to get the book out and the series done, but there's a very legitimate question as to Sanderson's focus here.<br /><br />The final point is that when looking at the three books produced by Sanderson, it's probably worth asking if writing only two might have been a better idea.  It's fair to note that Sanderson probably had to fill in a lot in between Jordan's notes.  (It would be quite interesting if Tor received permission to publish Jordan's notes, although this is unlikely.)  That said, in looking at the entirety of the last three books, it seems quite possible that they could have been edited to a much tighter and more interesting two books with significantly less battle and maneuver and a lot more character evolution.  It's probably unfair to criticize Sanderson too much for this as his strengths are not Jordan's, but it's also fair to wonder exactly why he took the tack that he did.<br /><br />Still, it's better than many endings of long standing series and certainly better than not having the series completed at all.  It's just not wholly satisfying.  A simple way to think of things is that if you'd asked a fan in the early 1990s if the first few books of the Wheel of Time would still be read over and over in 2013, the answer would have almost certainly been yes.  If you ask a fan today if A Memory of Light will be read over and over 20 years from now, the answer will almost certainly be no.  On that note, a slightly sad but appropriate 3 stars.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|excellent show and what better way to watch than back to back!<br />it came in time for christmas and was good watching on vacation<br />with nothing else on tv.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|Great service, great movie!  I hadn't ever seen this movie and I loved it.  I recently bought the movie &#34;The Two Jakes&#34; because I liked this movie so much.  Thanks a bunch.
B007EE4XKI|3.0|The beginning is good but the middle kind of drags with the first person narrative. I like the way they bring data's consciousness back.
B001MSMULG|3.0|I've read half a dozen of Silva's books and this wasn't my favorite.  Good, not terrific, worth reading if you're a fan.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|It was one of the best books I've ever  read in my life since I went to the public library
B006VFLIYK|2.0|I haven't read many Baldacci novels and if this is one of his good ones ( one of the best?) I'm probably not going to spend much time or money reading more.  To simple.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works good and offers lots of info. Love checking in other cities also. Love the 15 day forecast.  Still learning more about it.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Not yet finished reading my first Vonnegut book, didn't read it when it was first published, and loving his originality and style.  Nothing else quite like it and very well put together.  Enjoying it and recommending it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was written by a wonderful person and I don't think that it could be any better. I love it.<br /><br />FANGIRLS ALL THE WAY!!!!!
