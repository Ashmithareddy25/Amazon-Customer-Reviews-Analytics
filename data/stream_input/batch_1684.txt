B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and easy on the eyes. I keep it in my favorites as a great go-to app. I need to explore all features.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Sure it ask if you want to buy gems. Just hit the &quot;x&quot; and play on. The game is so fun and intertaining. Always read the good comments other then the bad ones.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Keeps you reading. Provokes thought about human nature. Well written. Another good one from Gillian Flynn! I will be reading her others.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE, I REALLY ENJOYED IT, AND I CANT SAY THAT ABOUT MOST MOVIES. IT KEPT ATTENTION ALL THE WAY, WAS NEVER DULL, AND LOT OF ACTION JUST ABOUT ALL THE WAY THOUGH.A GOOD ENDING.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I kept hearing about the problem with force closing in this game, but I decided to buy it when I saw reviews about it being supposedly fixed. The game works great, does not force close at all and the quests are fun, too. Its a nice puzzle game and quite addicting. I recommend it to anyone looking for a challenge.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a good read. good love story good action, this book had a little bit of everything.<br />Can't  wait to read the second book.

B008XG1X18|5.0|This app has been the biggest improvement in my Artwork since I attended Columbus College of Art &amp; Design back in the 60's. In one place I have all the inspiration, tutorials &amp; community I could ever hope for.<br /><br />Thank you so much!  Nancy Barton / Grammacozy62
B00723NWJE|4.0|We usually hear Norah Jones as being more sentimental and relaxed, but on this album she takes a darker turn that although unexpected is still stellar. Many if not all the songs on here sound like something you'd hear from a jukebox, which is such a treat for the ears. But it's also why I gave it 4 and not 5 stars...it's because the type of sound effect they use to make her voice sound more vintage-y appears on a large majority of the songs. On the whole I recommend just buying the album, because basically if you like one song on here you're going to like to rest of them.
B007SGM084|4.0|I don't get the hype, it was typical sex romance novel. I enjoyed it, but I like that sorta romance thing...I purchased the trilogy, the story feels incomplete at the end of the first novel and you feel compelled to read more at the end of the second. Would make a good movie- Rated RX adults only or as a romantic comedy (there is enough of a story outside of the sex.
B008NW67E0|5.0|...so maybe I'm a bit biased to like this album more, but it really is just so good. It has more of a positive outlook than the last album, with no limited use of the banjo and terrific lyrics. The flow of this album is so great. It starts off as energetic, then slows down a bit for a few tunes, then right back up again for the end. It's hard to find albums that you can listen through continuously like this one.<br /><br />Just fyi though my cd came in a flip-book type of cover, and not in a plastic cd case. It felt more like a 70s record than a modern day cd. Not a bad thing and it doesn't bring the rating down any stars, just an observation.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|This little sleeve is what it is. Nothing more nothing less. A neoprene like material with a stiff section. If you're looking for padding or drop protection this is not what you want. If you want a well built sleeve to not have your Kindle HD 7 scratched while in a purse or backpack this is it.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Balducci has one of the most creative minds in the literary field. I try to keep up with his books but i find that I sometimes need \\"time out.\\"  The intense nature of the story line can make me hold my breath as I read. I can picture the characters, the places as they unfold. I do read other authors new and old, I like to read thrillers, some biographys, etc.<br />The Innocent filled with excitement, a thriller that can keep anyone on the edge of their seat. Glad I was looking, thanks for the opportunity to share.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Hazel and Augustus are teenaged cancer survivors who meet at a kids cancer survivor group. They are immediately attracted to one another. These are not normal teenagers...their disease has caused them to mature in ways that most of us can not imagine. Despite their realistic world view (or perhaps because of it), they each have a wickedly fun sense of humor that may cause you to laugh out loud. Along with Hazel and Augustus, we also meet their parents and friends who are just as humorous and lovable. It is nearly impossible not to feel affection for all of these characters.<br /><br />We are permitted to watch the relationship between Hazel and Augustus grow, and what an honor it is. I really don't want to say much about the plot for fear of spoiling it for anyone. But trust me, this book will make you laugh and cry like a baby...have a box of tissues on hand when you read it. You may also want to jot down some of the very quotable things these characters say for later reflection. It is a phenomenal book. John Green is a genius. I absolutely loved this book and may read it again in the future.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The prologue hooked me right in. Longer books increase the pleasure of new characters. I did not guess the ending- WOW. I could not wait to discover each new twist. And twist and twist...Happy and sad... Now I will read her other books. I had not heard about Kate Morton before \\"The Secret Keepers.\\" Bravo! And another Kindle joy.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was very fortunate to get an ARC of The Secret Keeper. I loved it and could barely put it down! Kate Morton is so readable; her stories flow with her beautiful writing.<br /><br />One summer day during a party at her family's farm in the English countryside, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson sat daydreaming in her childhood tree house. She saw a strange man approach the farmhouse and watched as her mother briefly spoke to him...and then stabbed him to death with a knife. Her mother's act challenged everything Laurel knew about her nearly perfect mother, Dorothy. Why did she do it? Who was the stranger?<br /><br />Fifty years later, Laurel and her family are gathering at Greenacres farm for Dorothy's ninetieth birthday. Dorothy is seriously ill, and Laurel believes it may be her last chance to get answers about the killing which she has tried not to think about for so long and has never even discussed with her siblings. Laurel begins to research her mother's past from clues found in a book and photograph.<br /><br />Dorothy's story takes us from pre-WW2 England through the Blitz to the present. It is the secret story of three strangers--<br />Dorothy, Vivien and Jimmy--who meet by chance and whose lives are forever connected. Laurel's research will unearth many secrets and will bring her (and the reader!) many surprises.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like this game. It can be addicting and a little tiresome.<br />However if you have nothing to do it can be a nice way to pass the time.
B001NLKT60|4.0|A good follow up to The Girl w/ the Dragon Tattoo.  Can' t wait to read the next one. Hard to put down.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Too many characters to follow, gets very confusing. There is not one normal family in this town everyone is screwed up to the point where it is very unbelievable. the end is horrible, nothing is resolved! Had a hard time finishing this book. This is one I will not reread!

B000002KAT|5.0|As a self-proclaimed long-time music aficionado since I was a teenager, I ask myself at this moment:  \\"how in the hell did I somehow miss this album throughout the years?\\"<br /><br />I mean seriously, music has been a mainstay throughout my life, and I consider myself very well-versed in so many music genres.  My iPod is chock full of classics and every type of music imaginable, and somehow I missed the boat on this album.  Heaven knows why, but I don't!<br /><br />And I have always loved this kind of music!  So let me break it down...<br /><br />This album is absolutely timeless.  An alien could land on Earth 5,000 years from now, somehow play this album, and it would probably fit the times then too.<br /><br />Bottom line...<br /><br />It is all just magical.  Not only does Van Morrison have one of the best and most emotional voices ever recorded, the bass lines coupled with the acoustic guitar melded with the accompaniments of the various instruments dropped in throughout highlighted by the amazing crescendos, beats, and melodies, all-the-while complicated, simple, and just absolutely original and impeccable for the times makes just one must-have album for all those who love music.<br /><br />Run-on sentence?  Yes.  But, how else could I describe one totally flowing masterpiece such as this album which has obviously stood the test of time.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Pretty good sauce in there, aye ace?  My review would be like any other of the 9 million that tune in to the how.  Buy it now.
B008VKNEJU|5.0|Wow. Jessie ware is a talented force to be reckoned with.This is a Great album with every song at a quality that can't be touched with radio music nowadays. Jessie's voice is so silky and smooth, and she takes different elements of genres to create her own little masterpiece. Her album is a definite buy for people appreciate something different, but  so real; A word that is missing in music today.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|I always thought Bob Dylan was a great musical talent but he would be completely unknown if he had not made the albums (as they were called then) before Nashville Skyline.  He has ridden the inertia of those early albums, which were really good, for all the years since.<br /><br />In this CD he seems to be finding a new style and I enjoyed much of it.  But his voice is becoming unlistenable.  In a classic emperor has no clothes moment, I was playing this disc in my car with my 4 year old grandson along.  He enjoys most music but he demanded this disc be turned off.  When I asked why he said the voice and then hissed \\"the guy is a vampire!\\".  Sorry Bob.  Dylan may have written more songs sung by others than anyone and hopefully some good singers will pick some of these up and show us how good they can be.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|For many who read this it will be foreign entertainment. For me, however it is a re-living. My Christian is not a zillionaire but the rest is mostly accurate. There are things in the world that damage a person beyond their capability to recover fully. And in Christian's case, and mine, some of the things that heal you hurt you in other ways.  This is the story of one who would be healed and one who has to hurt before they can be healed. <br /><br />The dialogue between the two suffers from trying to straddle the fence between sexy-fantasy world and the real one.

B00005YU1O|5.0|My wife and I are kindred spirits, uniquely different but complementary.  As we've grown together into our fourth decade of marriage we still spend hours and hours each week talking together to evaluate, analyze, and reconstruct our thoughts, experiences, and nightly dreams.  Watching \\"Waking Life\\" together was like injecting an amphetamine into our conversation about recent experiences and their influence on personal growth.  It literally took us about five hours to watch the movie because we kept hitting the remote's pause button to share our insights with each other.  The movie gave us new avenues to approach our experiences, both recent and long familiar.  The movie actually enabled us both to experience what we've come to call a \\"red letter\\" calendar day, those rare days that have the potential to shift the direction of our personal expression.<br /><br />We've not been able to put the movie away on the shelf since watching it.  Letting it sit on the coffee table in the family room is a constant reminder of the insights we experienced.  She did have a bit of a hard time watching it at times, experiencing the onset of motion sickness, but she just closed her eyes and listened, unwilling to miss any of the thoughts the movie stimulated.  Waking Life is now one of our favorite films.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|\\"The books I love most are like open cities, with all sorts of ways to wander in.\\" So says Clay Jannon, the narrator of Robin Sloan's marvelously magical book, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. Honestly, any novel that combines a celebration of a lifetime in the literary world, a lifetime of reading, along with a rollicking, mysterious adventure, is one I could imagine myself living inside of.<br /><br />The economic recession has hit Clay Jannon hard, causing him to lose his job as a web designer and marketer for a profitable bagel company in San Francisco. Finding himself doing everything but looking for a job, one afternoon walking around the city, he comes upon Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, and after proving his ability to quickly climb a ladder to fetch books from high shelves, he finds himself employed, working the late night shift.<br /><br />But the more time he spends in the bookstore, the more he realizes it's not your average establishment. The inventory is random at best--there is very little rhyme or reason to what books the store carries. Very few customers come to the store while Clay is working, and those who do come in repeatedly and don't actually buy anything, but instead borrow mysterious books written in an indecipherable language from strange corners of the store. And then there's the matter of the logbook which Mr. Penumbra requires Clay write in after every customer leaves, and record every aspect of the transaction, down to the customers' moods, even what they're wearing.<br /><br />Clay knows something strange must be going on, and to fill his late night hours, begins investigating. He enlists his girlfriend, Google employee Kat, his childhood best friend Neel (now owner of a successful tech company), and his artist roommate Mat in trying to figure out what mysteries lie within the books, the store, and Mr. Penumbra himself. And what they find takes them all on a rollicking adventure which touches on data visualization, literary and graphic history, the choice of hewing to tradition vs. embracing change, and, most importantly, a love of books.<br /><br />This is a magical, compelling, well-written book I absolutely loved. I'm a big fan of books that take you on an adventure, and even if I wasn't always completely sure what was going on, this book hooked me from start to finish. Robin Sloan has created a tremendously fascinating, complex, and exciting world, and the characters are multidimensional and very appealing.<br /><br />If you like your stories with a side of adventure, or if you like books that don't follow a traditional plot or story flow, definitely pick up Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. You'll find yourself utterly captivated and wishing you could find his bookstore and be part of the adventure.
0307237699|1.0|So, I figured it would be a good time read this book and see if the audacity was really what we would embrace.  It is not and I here to say that hope was more of a dream if you take a view of this book for the future and a driver toward that future.  Perhaps, that is unfair in the text itself, but this was what was used as a major political platform.  I say in theory is it nice left ideal, but in practice as with communism or social democracy, is a failure.  I cannot recommend this book or its content.
B00006AUIG|1.0|director completely blew it with this horrible movie. acting was insanely bad. story was lame as hell. confusing yet i didnt care at the same time. stupid ending.<br /><br />i had heard so many good things about this movie and that cover poster is kinda awesome....just kinda though.<br /><br />boring waste of time. caruso dude is a awful actor.<br /><br />skip this.
078401213X|1.0|If you like black and white movies this is for you.<br />If you like grainy movies this is for you.<br />If you like a guy with a constant Niagara like nose bleeds this is for you (serious...constant nose bleed scenes).<br />If you like grubby urban settings this movie is for you.<br />If you like computer chips that manufacture \\"goo\\" (huh?) this movie is for you.<br />If you like scenes of a guy working on delicate computer chips with a power drill containing a huge bit this movie is for you.<br />If you like same guy shaving his head and performing an operation on himself with same drill this movie is for you.<br /><br />I read there was some sort of intellect associated with this movie.  Must have been promoters...writing the reviews...that is.  This movie is on a par with most of the low budget junk you run across and cannot bear to watch on the \\"Sci-Fi\\" channel. Only this movie is grainy black and white.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|We received this item faster than expected and we have not realized any issued with it after about 2 months. Good product, decent price.
0440244412|5.0|What a whirlwind! Considering the speed at which I consumed the Fever Series, a rereading may be in order. I enjoyed every second of it, but in my \\"fever\\" (excuse me, please) of needing to know what was going to happen among the Fae, Barrons, and Mac immediately , I certainly did not grasp the full nuances of these characters and their complex mythology.<br /><br />This series is a truly pleasant surprise. Although entertained by the debut novel Darkfever, I never expected the series to be so enthralling and complicated. The meticulous unfolding of the plot demonstrates that Moning must be a deft outliner, even if her actual prose is occasionally lacking. Though I must say, in books 4 and 5, her writing improved greatly, but I wish she would stop with her incessant use of acronyms. I feel blasphemous for even suggesting it, but while reading the Fever series, I could not help being reminded of the Harry Potter series. The flawed but lovable characters, constant twists, deep mythology, and numerous confusing prophesies are all so reminiscent of my beloved Harry Potter (excepting, of course, the copious sex present in Fever). I think Harry Potter has a bit more emotional resonance, but from a superficial standpoint, the joys of the plots, characters, and mysteries are similar.<br /><br />It was a joy being trapped in the Fever universe for a week, and I know I will return to it by rereading and analyzing it. In particular, I want to give more thought to Barrons and Mac's relationship because even though I'm happy how they turned out, its tumult and complexity warrants further evaluation. I am also so so so happy to see that Moning is continuing to write about the Fever universe, even though Iced: A Dani O'Malley Novel follows one of my more disliked characters and the 6th direct sequel to Fever does not come until 2015! If Moning maintains her expert plotting skills, I assume I will gladly be reading about the Seelie, Unseelie, and Mac & Co for quite some time.
B005L3HJ8M|5.0|i have to say  i  dowloaded a song, because i seen these guys perform on saturday nit live and  decided to buy the album, for a change  i  bought it on lp  yea  record  it sounds better than  what i downloaded..  Great jobs thanks for putting it on record.
0061148512|4.0|The Bell Jar is a hard book to read. In reading it, I felt like I was trapped in Esther's bell jar myself. Her words, so achingly real--almost certainly related to the book's semi-autobiographical nature--evoke the struggles of not only women but also any overachiever and any loner. Throughout the novel, we see how the bell jar encaged Esther and we see how slowly, very slowly, she lifts it off of herself.<br /><br />I think the reason I appreciated this book so much is that the problems Esther faced are problems I've faced, and although I'm better than Esther, I've felt so low sometimes I felt like breaking. She showed me that she wasn't crazy; there was nothing wrong with her besides these social circumstances that she just couldn't cope with, try as she might. I love reading books where I feel like the narrator expresses my thoughts in a more tangible and eloquent way (and Plath can write!) The only reason it wasn't perfect for me--although this rating may change upon more reflection--was that mental illness is, well, pretty boring. The repeated suicide attempts and the monotony of life in the asylums are not particularly gripping, but I understand their necessity to the story.<br /><br />I just wish I could read this story with Esther walking into her final interview with the psychiatrists and walking out of the bell jar, however, it is impossible to read that last page and then not remember Plath's suicide shortly after this book's publication. Because of this knowledge, instead of ending with a sense of hope, the book ends with the feeling that bell jar is forever, it always exists, floating right above our heads, ready to collapse upon us again.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a high-quality game and one which held my interest to the finish.  It is a pretty standard match-three type game but coupled to a story which is told in both voice and text and illustrated with some fairly impressive graphics.  It reminds me a great deal of Jewel Quest, right down to the different types of \\"special challenge\\" tiles.  The graphics behind the story are more elaborate, however, and I personally found the story more interesting if somewhat simplistic.<br /><br />The match-three portion has enough challenges (which build as one progresses through the levels) to keep it interesting without being so difficult that one is likely to give up in frustration.<br /><br />It's a solid game with no questionable permissions required and I found it fun to play.  I don't know if it's worth $4.99 -- it was easily worth \\"Free\\" as the FAOTD -- but it is well done and a cut above many of the games out there so that is an accomplishment worth rewarding.
0143038583|4.0|A book that changed my opinion on what I should be eating but also made me depressed that corporations and the government control so much of what we eat, even if it is to the detriment of the animals, the environment, and our health. Pollan demonstrated how every bite we take is a political statement. In this election year where so many voters feel disillusioned and doubt the merits of either candidate, it is powerful to know that we can likely cause more political change simply by our eating choices. Although I appreciated this novel's critical scope, I found Pollan's writing to be self-indulgent at times. In particular, the final section on hunting and gathering was too focused on Pollan's personal struggles in shooting a boar or finding mushrooms or cooking a meal. I was tempted to skim at times because it was just so uninteresting and irrelevant to the purpose of the novel.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|this app is awsome but i must say needs an update to be consistant with the new steam comunity but other than that this app is amazing
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Rating this book required a somewhat unscientific weighting of pros and cons. On the one hand, I devoured this book. Despite working long days, I managed to finish it in less than a week (and admittedly, I did sneak in a few chapters when I was supposed to be working). This story wrapped me up and I simply needed to know what happened as soon as possible. Thus, a very weighty pro for A Game of Thrones is its captivating narrative. The plotting and characters are complex and beg to be known and read.<br /><br />On the other hand, the writing can be awfully atrocious. I was shocked when I read several professional reviews praising Martin's writing because I found the prose to be clunky to the point of hilarity. I read the line \\"Character X broke his fast\\" seemingly countless times. My absolute favorite line, both in terms of cringy-ness and funniness, was \\"his manhood glistened wetly.\\" I never thought of manhoods as glistening, but when they do, do they glisten in ways that aren't wetly? (Maybe they do if you're Edward Cullen). However funny these lines may have been, though, they detracted from the story. Martin overdescribes, so I was tempted to skim entire paragraphs. With a better editor, A Game of Thrones could have been a certain 4-star and a potential 5-star book. At the end of the day, a compelling story with interesting, realistic characters was enough to make this book an enjoyable read for me. I will read the second installment, A Clash of Kings with the hope that Martin learned to write better with each book.

Why are all Android apps beginning to get bloated? Leave it alone and don't advertise on the damn screen.

B008RV5K5E|4.0|No cheap puns. No lousy love story. Just bone-crunching fun.<br />I'm not a huge fan of comics but I have read the Dark Knight Returns. For the most part the film stays true to the story arc. It isn't a scene-for-scene/line-for-line representation, but it does capture Mazzuchelli's art, mood and style quite well. The fight scenes are fantastic.<br /><br />The soundtrack is brooding and takes some noticeable cues from Hans Zimmer's musical scores. I enjoyed it and would even buy a few tracks if they were available in mp3.<br />Peter Weller's low, brawny, full-bodied voice was a perfect choice for Batman. Gordon's performance was a little disappointing and a little wooden in places. The slang from the mutants sounded pretentious and unnatural at times, but the filmmakers did the best they could with Miller's writing. Frank Miller just doesn't have very good ear for dialogue.<br /><br />Overall, this is excellent for a cartoon though and an improvement on previous batman animations I've seen. And this IS a cartoon intended for teens and adults. I wasn't expecting some of the violence from the comic to be carried into the cartoon. But some gruesome elements may catch you off-guard if you haven't read the book, such as a scene where one of the characters is heard committing suicide off-screen.<br /><br />Most of the negative reviews come from morons who thought this was live action. Too bad. There's no scam here. And if you can't read or pay attention to what you're buying you deserve to be ripped off by people who are more intelligent. Congratulations, you get the Darwin award.<br />Otherwise, unless you have some neurotic, emotional attachment to Frank Miller's story exactly as it is presented in the comic, you won't be disappointed.

B0092SPYQG|5.0|PRoach fans don't need to be told that you'll love this long-awaited album--especially if you attended the Rockstar Uproar Festival after they had to leave the tour. This release features one track after another of intensely personal lyrics coupled with the band's signature blend of rap, gritty vocals and just enough electronic touches to keep it reverberating between your ears without sacrificing its rock-driven soul.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. It made me cry and kept me turning to the next page just to see what happened and hope there would be a happy ending.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|App is fun and entertaining, reminds me of the ones ss a kid at the carnival except  no real money lost.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love Mahjong but have a hard time finding something free AND worth while.  This one seems to fit the bill. Great graphics, sounds and scoring.  I've run through working up to the three stars for each. Thought I would try another app but eventually went back and reinstalled this one. Better to go back through and compete against the clock than to settle for a lesser class app! Enjoy!

B008FPZQRO|3.0|This review is for the Deluxe Edition 2012.  While I am a huge ELP fan, this is probably their weakest album in their catalog.  For those of you who used to listen to LPs, while side 1 starts and finishes strong, side 2 to me is almost unlistenable and seems to have been tacked on for the sake of getting the product out.  Greg Lake began straining his voice on some of these cuts and it is telling that the next album, TRILOGY, is a bit mellower (and a big improvement, IMHO).  The extra tracks and alternate takes are interesting but not essential.  The DVD 5.1 surround sound is a nice addition and it seems all of their first 6 studio albums will be released in these low-priced 2 CD/1 DVD versions, a welcome improvement from the myriad compilations soaking us for the last 30 years.  Once they're all out we can toss them.  The inner booklet's text is annoyingly printed over large single color photos of the band; the design and layout however shouldn't stop the serious fan from beginning to collect these prog-rock essentials.  Looking forward to TRILOGY and BRAIN SALAD SURGERY.
B0006HBZXS|4.0|Unlike the well deserved repudiation of '[[ASIN:B0083GQ2A0 The Grey]]' with Liam Neeson, there have been actual documented cases of brown bears stalking and hunting humans who weren't otherwise threatening, invasive, or wounded. So this film had the bona fides of being \\"real\\" - terrifyingly so. (a Google search yields many such recent cases, and many more that are referenced by old west stories)<br /><br />Intense and creepy tale about a group of ill-trained and ill-equipped city slickers caught out in the Alaskan wilderness. Having barely survived a plane crash, they only have what they're carrying - which is nearly nothing.<br /><br />Still, among the surviving passengers is humble multi-billionaire, Charles Morse, played with his usual deft and elegant proficiency by Anthony Hopkins. And while his character never actually had to live off the land, among his notable qualities includes an eidetic memory - everything he's ever seen, heard or read is permanently etched into his mind. That rare ability gives them a chance, knowing that they can utilize the primitive skills he's learned. Yes, 'book learned' as they say, but the will to succeed is buried deep within him. He didn't just have prosperity handed to him on a silver platter; he worked damned hard to get to the top. The fire that drove him as a younger man can be reapplied to their survival.<br /><br />All things being equal, with Charles in the lead, the group probably stood a good chance of making it out alive.<br /><br />Except for one major inequality - they've crashed into land that doesn't belong to them - modern humans. It's the kingdom of the Bear. The top predator. Long before hominids, the absolute undisputed ruler of the northwest territories. Having the intelligence equal to that of the smartest canines combined with an unforgiving killer instinct, qualities that instilled both fear and respect in the hearts of the native peoples who shared the land with them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the group find themselves in the middle of territory held by a particularly brutal version of ursine - a man eater. They're rare, but they do exist. The Department of Fish And Wildlife, and even the Forestry Service, annually put down bears that even remotely show that kind of behavior.<br /><br />And the rogue animal quickly recognizes vulnerable and delicious prey. As the group works their way to civilization over frozen mountains and harsh wilderness - the bear voraciously probes, hunts, and takes them one after another.<br /><br />Charles realizes that this thing isn't going to be satisfied until it claims every last one of them. Their only recourse - fight. Fight for their lives, literally.<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- 'Edge' stars Bart The Bear. And unlike his on-screen persona, was one of the sweetest, smartest, and most beautifully gentle animals I have ever seen. Bart's cohort and trainer still runs a wildlife preserve in honor of his late buddy. Please search their site - Wasatch Rocky Mountain Wildlife - and make a donation if you can.<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- An incredible and disturbing film given how much respect I have for bears. But if it came down to it, yes, I'd go to war with such an amazing creature. Just the thought alone is loathsome, and I would do just about anything to avoid such a conflict, but all things being what they are, I wouldn't want to be consumed alive as food.nd themselves in the middle of territory held by a particularly brutal version of ursine - a man eater.

B007KOMTUI|3.0|This season feels a bit like it is trying to be better, bigger, more insanely egotistical than Seasons 1-4. I had grown fond of Don Draper and in Season 5 I feel he becomes somewhat foolish in his impulsive decision to marry Megan. Somehow the characters are becoming cartoons of themselves,and their behavior a bit more unlikeable. Now I find myself a bit less interested in these people. They ALL seem shallow and doomed for unfortunate outcomes. Visually the season is as rich and enticing as 1-4.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|The Nite Ize LED upgrade kit was exactly what I needed and expected for my mini Mag-Lite.  The only problem was figuring out from the miniature icon-type instructions that polarity matters regarding which way you plug in the LED bulb.  Before I figured out the little icons I removed and reinstalled the bulb half a dozen times, coincidentally the wrong way each time!, and it wouldn't work.  Nearly having to use my magnifying glass, I figured out that there was a little frowny-face when the bulb is installed backwards and a little smiley-face when it is installed properly!  It would be helpful if there was an instruction in English that says so.

0316228532|1.0|I just love to read all kinds of books. I purchased this book not expecting any concrete results. I thought an  adult  novel from a very entertaining and well read author would be enjoyable or at least interesting, it's none of those things.<br /><br />Very few books have stopped me from finishing them and I was tempted to throw this one in the trash bin several times. It is  laborious and slow reading, and up to the last chapter a very depressing and unremarkable book.<br /><br />I'm glad I  stuck with it just to learn how these tragic lives ended but now it's were it deserves - in the trash bin.<br /><br />One of the few books I have finished and not bothered to pass on to anyone, at least my copy is out of circulation, thank god!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I REALLY wanted to love this book. I love a good romance but I was just annoyed half way through. The break up/make up BS happened way too many times and for no reason. I was determined to finish this book because I hate leaving anything unfinished but it was a struggle! Travis went from hardcore and untouchable to needy, desperate and pathetic. Abby (Pigeon as Travis called her - and that REALLY annoyed me. I mean really, I should do a word count for how many times he called her Pigeon or Pidge - uuggghh!!) Abby started out preppy and nice and she ended up allowing her on again/off again boyfriend to beat people to a bloody pulp for talking to her, she was schizo, disloyal, flighty, and nauseating. Done!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I'm not much of a fantasy reader but this book did hold my interest.  Would probably read others by the author.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Got me hooked these books and loved it! If u like a awesome fiction twist trilogy then read these books. I strength of the characters was great and plot was good too. I loved how well written it was and good in description
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Finally, a SciFi movie that lives up to it's hype. Great story and a terrific pre-cursor to Aliens. This BluRay has awesome sound and video. It ranks as my second best demo disc. Sound is very realistic and enveloping. Crystal clear and very detailed , I must add. The ending definitely leads into a second and probably a third movie. Can't wait for the next one.
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|I was almost scared to buy this after reading the initial reviews and back story about the album. What are they trying to do with Bobby Womack? But after finally getting \\"brave\\" enough to buy this and listen to it, I'm relieved to say that this is a most excellent album. I think one reviewer really nailed it when he noted that Bobby Womack sounds comfortable in the context of this \\"new\\" sound. No, it's not old school 70s soul, but even the modern garnishes of the production do not diminish the power of Womack's distinctive voice. Still lots of grit and growling and soulful emoting to be heard. Even if you find the production --- notably, the drum programming and \\"effects\\" --- to be grating, there is no denying the quality of the music. The songs themselves are very, very good. Some were written by Womack, and others by co-producers Damon Albarn and Richard Russell, along with a short but stompin' reworking of the old standard \\"Jubilee (Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around)\\" that closes the album. The thing that I DID find annoying about this album was the booklet that comes with the CD. Some \\"creative\\" soul from the art department decided that faint gold type on a crimson background would look nice. Yes, but that makes reading the credits and liner notes almost impossible. Expect considerble eye strain if you attempt this task. Otherwise, bravo to Bobby Womack and the producers for taking a chance with this daring approach. I dare say, if you listen to it with an open mind, you'll be impressed.
B001LMU182|5.0|As the title says, it's a classic. Great story and it changed anime forever. Extremely violent so definitely not for kids. Now for the audio. Wow! Make sure you play the Japanese audio track because the English track although also Dolby True HD is a much lower sample/bit rate than the Japanese one. Some of the clearest,sharpest, and most dynamic sound I've heard. It is a bit on the loud side and some of the sounds are exagerated(i guess for effect) but it does sound incredible. if you're into anime, this is a must own.
0307888908|5.0|This is an excellent book on entrepreneurship.<br /><br />A lot of people consider business and personal life to be two completely different things. What a lot of people don't realize, however, is that your entire life should be managed (to some extent, at least), as a business. You need to always be looking for good opportunities, always be taking risks, and always be making yourself uncomfortable.<br /><br />If you stop pushing yourself, putting yourself into difficult situations, and engaging with your industry--you will quickly become obsolete.<br /><br />This book is all about taking the reins when it comes to your professional life. Spend more time getting to know your colleagues in your industry. Spend more time seeking out opportunities to jump into. Don't always play it safe. Push yourself to learn new things, work with good people, and make yourself succeed.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in personal and professional development, it would really be a shame if you didn't get a copy of this book immediately. Other than being extremely fun to read, the book is very motivational and practical, and will certainly inspire you to improve yourself.
0143119680|2.0|I approach each book with a positive attitude and an open mind. Since the Shadow of Night (Harkness' 2nd book in this trilogy) was doing well, I opted to start with the 1st in this trilogy. I was not intimidated with the length of nearly 600 pages as I thought it would be a thrilling ride to read this book about witches and vampires (not my usual book of interest). However, I was terribly disappointed in this writer who teaches at an upscale university, because the writing was so poor. Or perhaps it is best to look to the editors who could have condensed this into maybe 400 pages and still had the same content. I agree with other reviewers that this was a behemoth of a book, way too long and verbose for the subject matter, repetitive dialogue and a boring story. I read with enthusiasm in the beginning and then I began to struggle with it as my interest in the characters and the plot diminished page by page. At about page 125, I could have cared less what happened to Diana and Matthew or what their purpose of being unrealistically together was about. I struggled with about 25 more pages and finally, which is uncharacteristic of me, I threw it into my sack of books to donate or sell at the used book store. This was difficult for me to do because I almost always finish a book I begin as a testament to my determination not to give up. However, once I let it drop into the donate sack I felt relieved. This was such a great disappointment and I doubt seriously I will ever read The Shadow of Night now. She needs to step up her game, shorten the length, develop better characterization and make the plot and story more exciting. The Discovery of Witches was truly a sleeper and it could have been a delightful, exciting story. I gave this 2 stars only because my attitude was great initially and it started out well, but it went south quickly for me. Though I couldn't and didn't finish it for lack of excitement, I am giving the author the benefit of the doubt that perhaps it gets better by page 579 and into the next volume of the All Souls Trilogy.better by page 579 and into the next volume of the All Souls Trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because it is easy and good and it has lots of games on it good game yeah
034580404X|5.0|The books came in great condition, delivery was very quick and I was totally pleased with it !!!<br />Great trilogy series of books - highly recommend it for an easy and exciting read.
0785153322|5.0|It was marvelous! It exceeded my expectations. I love Avengers and seeing how all of this came to be was awesome. The steps they did to make it and all of the costumes they had line up for the characters. I enjoyed the concept artwork the best. To see it come together and all of hard work put into it was amazing. And each book has its own little place in the collection that makes it unique. One of the best purchases I've made!
B009FZFONO|5.0|It is season 3 and time to move from the farm into a prison.  Once you have all the Zombies locked out, you've got nothing left to worry about, right? ... Right? ... Oh come on now.  People need to all be on the same team.  Can't we just get along?  Evidently not.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Says I need to install more for full capabilities, but then force closes when I try. I have hears good things about it though. This is a Fail for now. Galaxy Nexus
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun hidden object game with a bizzare backstory and some interesting characters. I like the different rooms, as they offer some variety to the game.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This one is the best one yet!  Full of action and funny too!  I should have purchased it. Will wait until the prices come down and buy it so I can watch it again.
1416563156|5.0|My son lives and breathes Indiana Jones...as such, when I saw this on amazon, I knew right away who had to have it.  I purchased it in anticipation of Christmas coming on quick, but after a very long day of helping out his dad with firewood, I decided it was a great reward.  HE IS OVER THE MOON WITH IT..  it is filled with all kinds of info about Indy's adventures..photos, info, facts, everything an Indiana fan would love.  He has been an I. Jones fan since he was about 4 yrs. old,  he is now 9 and is still enamored with the whole series.  I guess he will be a life long fan, and any fan that devoted, should have this journal.  :)
B0091REZMW|4.0|Playing on a Kindle Fire. Game is nice but it is hard to just tap one area. Makes for some frustration. Would be better if the image was larger.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|great app. !!! was my first option and really love it. Great to save information you'll need or important to you.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I normally don't write reviews for popular shows such as The Walking Dead however, I know several people that have yet to jump on the Walking Dead bandwagon. I'm not saying that my review will get anymore viewers to start watching, but I am someone who doesn't follow any drama series and was deterred by the fact that this is a drama series set during a zombie apocalypse. I didn't think I would enjoy the show but I was surprised at how much I like the story and therefore someone who might read this review could become a fan as well. My review will not cover analysis or critique of episodes but rather an overall review about my experience with the second season and the quality of the overall product.<br /><br />The menus are very simplistic and is easy to navigate. Each disc contained in the packaging contains 4 episodes. This Bluray presentation of the Walking Dead presents a fully high-def presentation of the show. To make this review short, you will be so hooked on each cliffhanger the episodes provide that you will realize you've been watching for hours when you switch the discs. This show has an incredible story that provides fast paced development with complex characters you'll love and hate. There isn't a character that is considered the prototypical bad guy and you may even start questioning the protagonist's decisions.<br /><br />Before watching this series Zombieland was the only Zombie movie/show I consider myself a fan of. This show however, takes the cake for the best zombie story ever.
0226264017|5.0|Being a Marxist me and Libertarians generally disagree on many issues but Milton Friedman was probably my favorite libertarian author. So-called Contemporary libertarians such as Ron Paul and other Conservative-Libertarians (an oxymoron may I add) ignore the genius of Friedman. Unlike modern \\"libertarians\\" who choose to ignore poverty or blame it on poor Friedman offered several ways to combat it such as the Negative Income Tax. Though I disagree with him on the nature of capitalism and economics in general he still provides a rare and indispensable work on economics.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Fantastic.  What a read. Catches you from the word go and enthralls you until the end.  Your'e unable to put the book down even at 2:00 in the morning, you are compelled to keep on reading.  In my opinion it reflects that mankind's worst enemy is ourselves.  Very thought provoking.  A definite must for any passionate reader.[[ASIN:1612183956 Pines]]
B004I744AS|4.0|Great stuff!  Much easier to work with than the others I've tried. The word games are particularly interesting. Please keep up the good work.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Game plays OK, BUT the full screen adds, some of which are streaming video with LOUD sound, that come up on the front of EVERY deal, drive me crazy.  Oh, and BTW, I'm not interested in meeting men under 30 in my area.  I don't recommend this app unless you want to view full screen adds at each deal or you want to meet men (or women) in your area under 30.
0345525558|4.0|Normally, I'm a bit hesitant to start books which focus so specifically on one certain idea or gimmick and this time was no different. I have had The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh on my shelf for months, but was intimidated by the actual language of flowers that it held - I wasn't certain I was in the mood, every time I picked it up, to be overwhelmed with information about flowers and, since I have the closest thing to a black thumb a girl can get, I was more than a little intimidated by it.<br /><br />What ended up happening was when I finally made the choice to pick the book up and dove into the story, my heart was captured by Victoria. She was tough, ruthless, and the complete opposite of me, making decisions I couldn't comprehend. Every time I expected the story to take a predictable turn, Victoria made a decision that shocked me - and it happened over, and over again. So I thought maybe that would be predictable - but then it just wasn't.<br /><br />There are several stories in this narrative: the story of Victoria finding a place, Victoria's history, the stories in miniature of those who needed Victoria's help, and more. Each story was spun slowly, which meant that the resolution of the book came even more sweetly.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book if you are looking for a feel good, happy story. It's more about healing, finding oneself, and examining the failings of a corrupt system which takes advantage of a young child who desperately needs a home.

B001AQT0UY|4.0|As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are \\"alternative\\" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\" is both hilarious and entertaining. The little critters are truly charismatic and mesmerizing (at least until they undergo their rather disturbing transformation, when fed past midnight or exposed to water!). Obviously, the special effects for this movie are quite dated (it's almost thirty years old now), but \\"Gremlins\\" was a staple of cinema for any child of the 80s. It's still quite entertaining (and comforting, in a strange way), though I suspect it may not be as well received by younger audiences who are used to modern productions. For those of us who grew up in the  80s, however, \\"Gremlins\\" is still gold, and a great \\"alternative\\" Halloween movie for the season of spookiness.

1932100660|4.0|This book is well written and factual. The senior author describes his own early, faulty beliefs in meat consumption as the best source of protein - necessary for children's growth and adults' maintenance of healthy bones and tissues. It is changing my way of buying and consuming food. It is a bit of a slow read, but then, I am a senior.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|My wife and I previewed the Blu-Ray version, thinking we might spring for the 3D. The visuals of the first third of the movie might have looked cool in 3D, but the rest was so incredibly, laughably bad it could not have been worse even in old, grainy 8mm projected onto a sheet hung on the basement wall.<br /><br />Who in the world finds this sort of dreck worth viewing - except for a hearty laugh? Plot - lame. Dialogue - lame. Acting - lame. Casting - OMG! Costumes - lame. Religious/philosophical/moral exploration - absurdly, laughably lame! Special effects - trite. Photography - fair, but wasted. Music - unmemorable. Nothing to recommend it. Zero. Zip. Nada.
B000E33VWW|5.0|This movie was just as I expected--it came brand new, still wrapped. The special features located on the DVD were useful for me with my students who had just finished reading In Cold Blood.
B001R3YRFS|5.0|This is a great movie and its price is great as well. Falling Down will make you laugh and keep you on your toes all the way through.
B0099G3I96|4.0|It's been much too long but this CD is definitely worth the wait. The band has grown and they have such a professional polish on every song. Gwen sounds better than she did in her 20s. Hope we don't have to wait long for the next CD - or Gwen's next CD.

B008GVD6D8|4.0|A good storey leading on from the first book.  Cannot wait for the next book to see where the relationship between Gideon and Eva leads!!! Some parts of storey could be better, as I think perhaps some of it is predictable, but it is still a very enjoyable titalating read.

B009QW7HMC|5.0|Wow... I hope the rest of the season can continue to deliver as much punch as this episode. It was fast-paced, full of excellent effects (I particularly enjoyed it when the guard with the gas mask lost his face), and left me anxiously anticipating the next episode. I appreciate the differences between the comics and the series and I can't wait to see how this story arc plays out because it's probably my favorite.
0316228532|5.0|This was an excellent character study and political narrative from a progressive point of view.  I can't help but feel there are a lot of Howard's and Shirley's (you will know what I mean when you read the book) whose right wing sensibilities (if there are such things) were wounded by the political positions taken and thus many of the negative comments about the book.
0920668372|5.0|I loved this book when I was a child and just had to get a new copy for my son! A beautiful story of the love shared between a mother and son!! I love this book very much and would definitely purchase it again!
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I give it two stars because the film looks great. The actions of many of the characters are absolutely stupid and when it treaded into Friday the 13th areas; the guy in the ruptured space-suit, toasted and walking around outside the ship and then fighting the others, I checked out. Also, when the \\"scientist\\" wanted to play with and pet the snake - worm creature, come on, give me an f'ing break. I didn't need a sequel to like this film; I needed a smart film, with characters NOT doing stupid things.
0688014291|5.0|Pretty quick shipping. And a great book that everyone should read. Super easy and fast...but with some information that is valuable to all ages. Very good book to read more then once

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Speechless. This book ends way better than I could have imagined and Gideon ends up being a better man than Christian in fifty- in my opinion..
B0086700CM|5.0|this game has it all! great theme, pretty good graphics, nice music! I love this game so much!!! its my favorite of all time!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This book really wasn't that good. I stopped reading it after %68 (kindle). I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Reasons below...<br /><br />1. I did not feel the chemistry between Travis & Abby at all. I really didn't care if they ended up together :( The writing just wasn't passionate or deep. Not at all.<br />2. Too much dialog in the book. Pointless conversations going on between several characters at a time. I felt like I was reading a play.<br />3. V.C. Andrews had steamier sex scenes than this book. Not that it should matter but if the book isn't good, should at least have some good scenes right?<br />4. I like reading about over protective dominating males (50 Shades, Bared To You) but Travis was just too realistically creepy. When he was angry he'd either brake something or beat someone up. (It didn't just happen once, it was throughout the book) Tattoo of her name, professing his undying love constantly even though she was freaking about about him doing it. There was more but I think I said enough.<br />5. With #4 said, I wouldn't suggest this book to any YA Women. They don't need to think that this kind of man is hot.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this game is ok.....I just seem to never have enough coins to keep playing. but I keep going back to it so it must be addicting.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked 50 Shades then you will like this one. It has a bit of the same story line but try not to compare too much to 50 and you'll enjoy. The writer does a good job with the characters, chemistry, passion etc. She's good, I'll read more of her books.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My 13 year old loved this series...She loves books about ancient Rome and Greece and adventure and this suited her perfectly!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is a terrific tool for organizing your thoughts.  i highly recommend it.  now, if only i can get the bluetooth keyboard working cleanly with my kindle fire hd . . .
0062082353|5.0|After reading No Easy Day, I've read a lot of SEAL memoirs in the recent weeks. This is the best one I've read so far, with only No Easy Day giving it any competition.<br /><br />After digesting, I can sum it up by pointing to that line to spoken to Private Blithe in the HBO series, Band of Brothers, regarding war: \\"It's the simplest thing in the world, Blithe.\\"<br /><br />This book is filled with the juicy exploits that those of us who want to live crazy situations vicariously (and can stomach the craziness inherent in war) will love. I very much enjoyed it.
0307887448|5.0|I hate science fiction and futuristic novels.  Seeing my kids read them and having it be their preferred genre makes me grind my teeth. I'm a historical fiction, biography, literary, and occasionally gossipy beach read kind of gal. On top of that, I don't generally write reviews.  Except something I heard on NPR made me think this was a book I would take a chance on.  I LOVED THIS BOOK! I read it in two days.  Maybe it was because I was a young adult in the 80's so I could relate to that aspect, historically speaking. Or maybe it was the fact that I can see this as so predictive of the future: a place of avatars, virtual reality, and mega corporations. Yet it kept me on the edge of my seat, rooting for the hero and his friends, the classic story of good versus evil.  I may not ever admit to liking this type of genre, but I will tell everyone to read this book.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Probably because I live under a rock, I wasn't aware that this was supposed to be a prequel of sorts to the Alien series. Judging from previews and this being a \\"Ridley Scott film,\\" I watched this movie with some hope that it would be a slightly artistic sci-fi offering.  Mostly, this is true. The film progresses very promisingly in the first half, with the haunting, intriguing set piece of an Engineer destroying himself to scatter his DNA, a 2001-like solo turn from Michael Fassbender as a puzzling, brooding android strolling around his futuristic ship, and finally an exciting set-up with a team of geologists, scientists, and archaeologists on the verge of investigating the outpost planet of an alien race that has supposedly created humankind.  After the inevitable plot thickening of the mission suddenly being revealed to be clouded with corporate or perhaps darker personal interests from the CEO figure Weyland, the scientists get into sleek spacesuits with egg-shaped helmets and investigate the outpost structure.  All this is done very well, but soon the movie starts to suffer from its provenance:  Alien was essentially an artsy horror flick on a spaceship, and Prometheus shows elements of that as the scientists start to die off in various outlandish ways.  As other reviewers have noted, the people on this ship behave much more childishly and quite simply MEANLY than anyone hired to engage in interstellar space travel would.<br /><br />Prometheus has some beautiful scenes, an advanced artistic vision in places, and is quite effective at its gross-out moments.  But I felt as though the film wanted it at least three different ways:  classy sci-fi, suspense and horror scares, and philosophical enquiry all rolled into one big-budget behemoth.  Sometimes it's incredibly puerile, which is a shame considering the thought and range of its special effects and untapped acting talent.  But I guess when you come from face-huggers, anything beyond that is progress!!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Monster is KISS's 20th Album and a very good one at that.After 2009's Sonic Boom,this follows up with a much heavier rock album blazing guitar solos some reminiscent of the Revenge album.The band still sounds tight.I know Kiss fans are picky but just enjoy the music,theres some great songs on this album.Props to the Monster Eric Singer drumming in top form and Tommy Thayer blazing out many killer riffs.Paul and Gene are always in top form.A kick ass album nuff said.

B008UTV6S8|5.0|Though sometimes it takes a 'second listening', Paul Simon's work is amazing.  Loved the older work AND the fun new pieces on this CD.  Never thought he would 'outdo' Graceland.  His last 2 give it a run for its money and all three are always in my queue.<br />Thank you Paul Simon.
0385738765|3.0|Of course, I will read the third book - I need to find out what on earth is going on because this second book leaves the reader hanging!  I liked the first book, even though it got a bit weird.  I can't say that The Scorch Trials was suspenseful, it was odd.  While it seems that the plot is headed one way, too many oddball things happen along the way.  Not my kind of book, but something in the story is keeping my interest up.

B0090O07S2|5.0|When The Doors were planning what to do for the Hollywood Bowl show in 1968 Ray Manzarek floated out the idea of coming out in Kabuki masks and Japanese robes. Alternatively, Jim Morrison, who was already showing the disillusionment of being a rock star, said \\"just give me my microphone, and do whatever you want to do.\\" Maybe if Morrison had been more receptive to the idea and they had gone through with it, the costumes would have distracted them from giving one of the best concerts of their career, and it was filmed.<br /><br />\\"Live at the Bowl `68\\" shows The Doors at the height of their musical prowess and their career. The summer before \\"Light My Fire\\" had made The Doors a nationally known act when it hit number one on Billboard's charts. Later in July of 1968 \\"Hello, I Love You\\" would do the same, and in September of 1968 they flew to Europe on what would become their one European tour. The Hollywood Bowl show was to be a celebration of The Doors and it was a hometown audience for the band, as well as the prestige of playing at the Hollywood Bowl. Before the show The Doors met and had dinner with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, both of whom attended the Hollywood Bowl show with Pam reportedly sitting on Jagger's lap during the show. That spring The Doors had started filming the shows that would become \\"Feast of Friends\\" so they decided to film the Hollywood Bowl show. If all that wasn't enough pressure, Morrison took a hit of acid before going on.<br /><br />\\"Live at the Bowl `68\\"  reveals the stark theatre of The Doors, Morrison prowling the stage, the rat-a-tat-tat of John Densmore's drums, Manzarek's apparent joy as he played, and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger wandering the stage like a lost troubadour. The Hollywood Bowl was an atypical Doors show in a couple of ways, one that they rehearsed prior to the show, and the second was The Doors had a setlist for the show and stuck to it! Something they rarely did. The deconstruction of \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\" that had poetic segues into the more traditional songs such as \\"Light My Fire\\" creates a jarring, disconcerting and theatrical effect. Morrison demonstrates his command of an audience, highlighted during \\"The End\\" when he goofs on a grasshopper he sees onstage and creates the impromtu \\"Ode to a Grasshopper.\\" When he realizes it's a moth says \\"uh-oh, I blew it, it's a moth\\" and gets a laugh, but he pulls everyone back into the tension and drama of the song.<br /><br />Then there's the reason for the release of this DVD, the restored three songs \\"Hello, I Love You,\\" \\"The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat),\\" and \\"Spanish Caravan,\\" finally make this show complete. The show was remastered and digitally transferred. The color has also been restored. You can see the green of the carpeting The Doors were playing on and Jim Morrison's face doesn't turn purple or look fuzzy as it does on \\"The Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl.\\" The restoration lives up to the claims on the promotional materials that it `feels like you're on stage with the band.'<br /><br />Something else that is unusual for The Doors is the DVD contains many bonus features, including \\"Echoes From the Bowl,\\" a brief history of the Hollywood Bowl, and includes The Doors history leading to the show at the bowl. \\"You Had to Be There\\" The Doors members' reminiscences of the show, and \\"Reworking The Doors\\" in which Bruce Botnick tells how he remastered the film and audio to give as close to a pristine Doors performance as possible. Also included is the 1984 music video of The Doors cover of \\"Gloria,\\" and their TV show appearances on the Smothers Brothers Show and Jonathon Winters show.<br /><br />If you already have \\"The Doors Live at the Hollywood Bowl\\" and you're wondering if you need \\"Live at the Bowl `68\\", consider the improved quality of the sound and the film, the restoration of the previously missing songs, and the inclusion of many bonus features. It's a package that you will find you need for your collection.<br /><br />The CD for \\"[[ASIN:B0090SVDO0 Live At The Bowl 68]]\\" is also now available<br /><br />Jim Cherry writes The Doors Examinerion.<br /><br />The CD for \\"[[ASIN:B0090SVDO0 Live At The Bowl 68]]\\" is also now available<br /><br />Jim Cherry writes The Doors Examiner
B009KUANWG|4.0|It has a real Shirley Bassey feel to it, taking you back to the glory days of John Barry/Marvin Hamlisch, et al.  The orchestra incorporates the Bond motif beautifully, especially the horns.  Adele's in great voice, still so much like a latter-day Randy Crawford, but hearing her constant intakes of air detracts from the experience.<br /><br />Lyrically... it's not so good.  It starts out in classic Bond fashion- a simple measure having almost nothing to do with the movie for the sole purpose of working 'Skyfall' into the refrain.  Then it switches into sort of an angsty love song or something, again just to work in 'Skyfall'.  Overall- I love the music, like Adele's singing but the lyrics are lacking.  But I guess that's what most Bond themes have been like, haven't they?  lol
1582701709|1.0|Do you want to know why this book is garbage? I'll tell you. Because it recycles ideas about faith that have been around since the time of the Bible. Get \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\", (written in the 1940's by Norman Vincent Peale) and you will see all the same ideas which have been repackaged and branded (marketing is such a great invention, is it not?) by today's slick self-help \\"gurus\\". The difference is, you can get a copy for a buck in a used book store down the street, while this book is a rip-off. It is a rip-off in every sense of the word. The title is an outright lie - what's the big secret? Just about everything in this book is already known and has been published in 100's or even 1000's of books.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this game had great story line. I couldn't put it down once I started. Some scenes were difficult, but figuring them out made it challenging. Can't wait for part two.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so excited to see a pinterest app for my Kindle Fire. It has been getting a lot of use, and my favorite site is at my fingertips!

B0087DFIOU|5.0|This was a much better movie than Edge of Darkness as the world weariness that marks the life of Mel Gibson and which is written on his face fits perfectly with the character he's playing in the movie.  Both guys are damaged goods and in many ways he's playing himself in this movie.  The movie itself is really only a four star movie in that it shows us or most of us at least a world we didn't know existed and has an interesting storyline with many different dynamics to it.  Devoid of star power in the main, the movie does benefit from good casting with many character actors that you've seen in myriad other movies doing what they do best namely playing interesting characters.  The little boy and his mum are particularly good and it's nice to see a real woman in a role instead of a sculpted faced B. Hills actress in the role.  The action sequences are well done and the look of the film is interesting.  It looks like they shot some of it on high def video which once again gives some elements a visually harder more real edge to them.  The music is also particularly good and was obviously chosen by someone with a sense of humour.<br /><br />I gave it one more star than it deserved to counterbalance the poor reviews that were more a critique of the man and his a__hole qualities than it was about the movie.  That seems unfair to me as then all the other people who contribute to a movie both in front of and behind the camera are not getting the recognition they deserve.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Great game. Would be better as a sanbox type setting. The FPS is horrible for my kindle fire. Graphics can be optimized better.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an emotional read that leaves one to ponder the realities of life for one facing a devastating battle with cancer.  John Green uses phrases that enable the reader to visualize the characters and the unfortunate circumstances with which they are surrounded.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|i dont know how mr grey put up with \\"ana\\" but baby i would have cut the cord along time ago. hopefully if i read the next books her ass want be as sore and she can not whine and nag about him. Like others have said it felt like you were reading the same things over and over again and it made me want to scratch my eyes out and scream. i'm not in love w/ the book but i have read a lot worse, and i have read  better. all i can say is she knew what she was getting herself into!!!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I won't give spoilers, but I do have to say that I had to watch this movie twice to truly see the tiny details that DO matter. I think that is why there are a lot of bad reviews. When people watch a movie in the theater, they tend to just mindlessly stare at the screen, and most don't pick up on every little nuance. It DID set up for the sequel, which has made some people angry. But the sequel will be an entirely different premise, so this movie DOES stand on its own. If you love Sci-fi, rent it and watch it twice, you won't be disappointed. If you just wanted a big movie, then go watch Transformers or something simple-minded like that. This is a brilliantly detailed movie.
1449415881|5.0|I mean, what can you say about Dilbert other than I'm glad I'm not him.  Bought this calendar for my brother as he absolutely adores Dilbert.<br />What?  What's wrong with him?  Oh, well Dilbert does remind me of some people so suppose it's closer to home than one thinks.<br /><br />My bro is sure to enjoy each day as he rips off the pages and views the next day.  I'm going to bet he's not going to wait the day to view the next day or two or week, ok, or month!  Yeah, OK, he'll probably check out the whole years worth in a day, but that would just be my bro!<br /><br />Great Item to give for a gift or, if you're a Dilbert fan, for yourself.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I haven't been this entertained by a book since \\"Tuesdays with Morrrie\\"<br />I'm recommending it to everyone...I only wish I had bought a paper edition so I could pass it along!
B0087YYHZU|2.0|I didn't realize I couldn't play Blu-ray DVD's on my player.  Unfortunately I had already opened the package so it couldn't be returned.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about when I saw the preview.  I rented it when it came out.  And was happily surprised.  It is now one of my favorite movies I watch it all the time on blue ray.  My kids enjoy it too.  It is a movie for everyone.  Great action and some good laughs.  I really hope they do a second one and have more marketing.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|the game is so cool but I have seen that some apps on the kindle fire don't work on the kindle HD why is it like that?
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A fun read!<br />It's well written and fast paced. You will not put it down!<br />There are some twist and turns that take this title further than any of the 50 shades ever did.<br />Above all, a very sexy read.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like it. it tells me what I can do for how long, like 3d games. only bad side is that when ever you start charging it, it takes you to the app .

B000ID37RM|5.0|To be honest I was dreading watching this movie, didnt seem to be the kind of movie i enjoyed being it was an old, black and white movie. My son had to watch it for school so i watched it with him. This movie was excellent!!! In my opinion, worth 5 stars!! Hope you enjoy.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|LOVE this show! So addicting! So much better than the books. Can't wait to see more. Will definitely be purchasing seasons to come!

B000YGIIPO|5.0|This is my first Pratchett book, and I have come to the party late, but I don't understand the YA category of this story. Surely all of this wit, phiilosophy and optimism, never mind the laugh out loud absurdity, are wasted on anyone under 30? (I would say 50, but I'm old).  These are characters that are so vivid and sharply drawn, I had an animated feature in my head the the whole time I was reading.  How does a writer make me care so deeply about what happens to rats named after labels on discarded food cans?  And I cared. More than I care about most characters in \\"grown-up\\"  fiction.  And, it's true, I will never look at rats the same again.  Part of me almost wishes young people wouldn't read this story, with its cynicism about humans displayed so prominently. After all, we are just rats, I mean humans. Part of me is pleased Mr. Pratchett is so profilic, because there is a lot more to read.  But part of me doubts any of those other books could meet the high standard established by this universal, heartfelt, and thoroughly satisfying tale.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Second season is even better than the first season. More danger and more character development. A lot of big scenes and a few emotional ones' as well. Can't wait for the third season...
1465001123|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo34QBBE1GTSDT1]]I compared the 2013 large calendar to the 2013 small calendar and found that 10 out of 13 spreads had the exact same pictures. The images are all black and white with one colored detail in each picture. The images on this large calendar are all very grainy and some don't appear very focused. Definitely a let down from last year. And FYI, this is the same calendar being sold at Target, even though the image on their website shows a different picture.

B005S9ELQ2|4.0|\\"Argo\\" could have descended into the kind of explosions and car chase<br />thriller one would expect from such a topic, namely the successful<br />extraction of 6 US Embassy workers from Tehran at the beginning of the<br />Islamic revolution in 1979. Based on a true account, Ben Affleck (who<br />deserves all acting and directing kudos) maintains a tight leash<br />throughout, using tension and what-if dread as the main adrenaline<br />builders. It is a testament to his ability that even knowing the<br />outcome does nothing to keep you from the edge of your seat. The CIA<br />operative he plays, Tony Mendez who masterminded the plot, is no James<br />Bond. He uses his brains, not his gun to achieve his goal, one that<br />seems insane to his superiors.<br /><br />The acting is precise and realistic. Comedy relief is provided by<br />John Goodman as Hollywood special-effects guru John Chambers who has all the good lines.<br />He and Alan Arkin, as producer Lester Siege,l maintain a rollicking R-rated<br />banter together. This being a suspense thriller, there are some fabricated<br />scenes of last-minute miracles (phones picked up at the last second, etc)<br />but they can be forgiven considering the excellence of the whole film.<br /><br />Sharp viewers will be treated to modern Iranian history at the intro<br />and it doesn't put the United States in a good light. When the freely<br />elected Mohammad Mosaddegh nationalized the Iranian oil industry in<br />1953, he was overthrown by a CIA coup and replaced with the Shah of<br />Iran. The Shah was a dictator as brutal and bloody as Saddam Hussein but<br />as one of the CIA bureaucrats in \\"Argo\\" suggests, he was a tyrant, but he<br />was OUR tyrant. In short, you can violate human rights all you want<br />as long as you don't mess with our oil supply.<br /><br />The only things that redeem the CIA in this film are that the Islamic<br />revolutionaries were just as brutal and the bravery of Mendez and his<br />team

0316228532|3.0|I really looked forward to reading this book. I had high hopes for a book targeted at adults but in that same un-put-downable style that Rowling is so very capable of. Alas...it wasn't to be. It seems to me that Rowling's idea of good writing for adults is picking a fairly grim (but very factual) topic and then using really obscure words to describe it. Thank goodness for Kindle's definition function. The story didn't grip me and I didn't find any of the characters lovable enough to retain my interest. It's a real shame because she can write....I think maybe she just tried too hard to be different from her previous works this time round and it didn't quite work.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This  book was intense!!  I just couldn't stop and now I'm starving for the 3rd book already!!! Amazed at how well these books can just keep going and keeping you wanting more chapter after chapter.

0307720950|5.0|This book was eye opening. I had heard about someone hacking an inkjet printer years ago and adding the third dimension and replacing the ink with some fabrication material but that was it. But, open sourcing hardware and design is obvious but hidden to most.<br /><br />Hard to believe [[ASIN:0465027466 Fab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication]] was out there in 2005 and I missed it. I knew something was going on but these two books provide a staggering context in the main message. Anyone can make, market and sell anything with virtually no capital and that things that made the digital revolution so big port directly to the atom world that is 10 times bigger.<br /><br />Third Industrial Revolution sounds about right.

0062127241|5.0|I just finished this delightfully insightful, humorous memoir: terribly tragic at times, filled with revealing, shocking, heartwarming and comical anecdotes about my rock-'n'-roll heroes and periods of my youth--straight up to today; a story which evidently took a great deal of soul-searching by the author to present his tale in a forthright, honest manner that makes me feel like I have personally known Pete Townshend from day one. Kudos to a master musician and fine artist, a musical Renaissance man, and a great inspiration to our generations past and present for a fantastic, fascinating book, highly recommended in my most humble opinion.

B004498KPU|4.0|Whose incompetent idea was it to REPLACE the original Michael Jackson version with this horrible remix by the Refugee Camp on the official video collection entitled Michael Jackson's Vision?  THIS torturous audio garbage is not Michael's vision, not his approved version and promoting Refugee Camp's inferior version over Michael's masterpiece is an absolute outrage and ruining his legacy.  I am totally appalled.  Making a remix is one thing ... unilaterally pushing it on a DVD collection which should be only original material by an artist is disgusting.  Whoever did this has no sense of quality or respect for Michael's legacy.  :-?

B005LAIHY0|4.0|I'm going to keep this pretty simple and short. This is just my opinion, I'm sure many people will disagree/agree with me.<br /><br />For starters I really enjoyed the movie. I think the acting was actually pretty good. I've seen much, much worse acting in movies before. But the acting wasn't really the focal point of the movie, it's all about the Special Effects which look amazing.<br /><br />I don't know if Ridley Scott's whole premise for this movie was simply to set up a sequel but that is what it seems to have done. At the end of the movie I was like \\"what the hell did I just watch? What's the point damnit!\\" It sets up a lot of questions. Especially in the whole alien universe canon. I really don't want to add any spoilers. But it's almost frustrating.<br /><br />Perhaps he's meaning for this to be some kind of stand alone story? Which doesn't make any sense because the plot doesn't wrap up at all. It's literally left open ended. Bah. I'm gonna stop talking about it or I'll start mentioning spoilers.<br /><br />But because of the openness of the ending it makes what's a really enjoyable movie and leaves you wanting more that makes it a bit of a let down. Without knowing if there will be a second movie to look forward too it's like getting to the bottom of a Drumstick Ice Cream Cone and finding they forgot the chocolate.<br /><br />It looks like there will be a second one. [...] I think that one will really make or break this movie. The way it's made it just can't stand on it's own. There has to be an ending to all the questions/plot lines it raises.<br /><br />Bottom line if you enjoy the Alien Franchise you'll probably enjoy this movie even though it's style and pacing is different. But you will leave wanting more. I think sales of this Movie will actually pickup if a second movie is released. As people will want to know what brought it to that point.

B008OTTRXU|3.0|*3.5 Stars*<br /><br />Carly Rae Jepsen is most known for her girl-next-door persona. And that personality could not be any more apparent on \\"Kiss\\", which is technically her sophomore album. Her debut set \\"Tug of War\\" failed to chart or make any significant impact, which definitely made Miss Jepsen squirm for her time in the spotlight. So, to finally make it big, she brought in a couple of pop song writers, and the end result of this collaboration was the best pop single of 2012: \\"Call Me Maybe\\". If that song doesn't represent sugary, simple, irritating pop, then Miss Jepsen would be in for the biggest flop of her life. But \\"Call Me Maybe\\" is the exact single that Carly Rae needed to put on the radio. Its synth-strings, simple lyrics, and glossy sheen is the to the tee formula for an inescapable pop song. But what's a girl to do to extend her 15 minutes of fame? Once her second single \\"Good Time\\" was released, there was really only one viable option left for Carly, her sophomore album. Don't let \\"Call Me Maybe\\" or \\"Good Time\\" fool you, \\"Kiss\\" is not a 12-track clone of those two tracks. No, this album is not nearly as modern, or unfortunately as good, as those irresistible lead singles. But fret not, \\"Kiss\\" is not by any means a terrible album, but it's not exactly a fantastic one, either. Carly did manage to accomplish an albumm with different varieties of pop. She pulls songs straight out of the 80s and early 90s, back when Madonna was ruling the charts. And while Carly is not nearly as provocative as Madge, she still manages to amplify hyper emotions and efficiently make every song on the album sound just as addictive and catchy as \\"Call Me Maybe\\" itself. And let's face it, who else could have made a Justin Bieber assisted track sound good? Carly sticks to what she's good at, and that's milking her sweet and endearing persona for everything it's possibly worth. She works it well throughout the confection that is \\"Kiss\\", but she also could have spent more time ondeveloping the flimsy production and adding stronger hooks.<br /><br />Putting 12 high gloss, fizzy, and sugary pop songs on one album will be a little too much to consume at once. This is poppy and pop music can get, which means by the end of the last song, you will already forgot most of what you've heard since most of the content here only skims the surface and lacks any nutritive substance. While \\"Call Me Maybe\\" and \\"Good Time\\" relentlessly get under your skin, songs like \\"Your Heart is a Muscle\\" and \\"Tiny Little Bows\\" seem calculated and their hooks are indistinct compared to the rest of the album. In fact, the only songs that linger for any time after their listen are the lead singles, \\"This Kiss\\", \\"Beautiful\\" (which is surprisingly good given the fact that Bieber was featured, by this only proves how hiddenly brilliant Carly Rae is), and \\"More than a Memory\\", which is definitely a cliched ballad about waiting for a special someone you met at a club to call you back, but is also more distinctive than its successive songs. These songs are what prevent the album from crumbling under its own weight, and what will make Carly relevant for at least a year longer than the release of \\"Call Me Maybe\\". But if she wants to make a real influence on the mainstream pop of this generation, Carly Rae Jepesen is going to have to hit the books and enter the early 2010s. For now, she can get away with retro pop and singing content which is far below her age of 26 years. Eventually, she will have to grow up and when that happens, her aspirations will be reached and her full potential will skyrocket her to superstardom. \\"Kiss\\" is a pyrrhic victory, while it does finally put her on the map, it is never as sleek or as addictive as \\"Call Me Maybe\\".

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Totally smitten with Gideon, what a sexy, dark and dangerous hero! In the beginning I was annoyed with the way some of the scenes from Bared to You were \\"copy/pasted\\" and thought Sylvia Day could've picked up and continued without the recapping. The rest of the book totally made up for any of my annoyances. The emotional angst, and hot love scenes kept me reading without putting the book down. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book! Can't wait for the next book. Dec, 31... hurry please!
B009GEGW62|5.0|Great show as always, never disappointed!! I suggest getting HD if available. We have been watching every episode and accidentally missed this one and panicked.

Thank you Amazon....
0316228532|5.0|There is barely a single likeable character throughout, but each is superbly depicted.  Rowling has \\"set to\\" with her obvious dislike of the parochial, small-minded English middle class, and its lack of any decent sentiment for those less fortunate than themselves - and that's no small number of the population today.<br /><br />Clearly wanting to create some distance from her famous reputation as a children's storyteller, this couldn't be further from the magic of Hogwarts, albeit that it's at least a little reminiscent of Rowling's desire to showcase difference and convey a message of tolerance. JK's not in the business of creating just a good story; she's trying to make a difference in the world too.<br /><br />Not the easiest of reads, owing largely to the unpleasant characters, but persevere because you'll be hooked into the plot soon enough.  Predictable to the extent that it was clearly not going to end well, but precisely how was anyone's guess.<br /><br />Congratulations on an amazing transition to adult fiction.  Very courageous.<br />[...]
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|excited it came out free for Kindle Fire. love this game. its fun and challenging. let the piggies go wild.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|After reading \\"Bared to You,\\" I was really excited for this book to come out but after reading it last night, I was really let down. \\"Bared to You\\" was uniquely character-driven and I loved reading it because Eva and Gideon were two real, troubled and interesting people and I loved watch them try to work out their scorching hot relationship. \\"Reflected in You,\\" however, watched their relationship completely fizzle to near emotional abuse. Eva is rarely truly happy; she breaks down and cries and panics almost every two chapters while Gideon's unstable and unexplained behavior drives her nearly to insanity whereas she was, before, a strong, educated, funny, and sexy woman by herself, and I thought she was something to look up to. Gideon uses sex against her on multiple occasions, withholds information about himself and knowing well it drives her crazy, he continues to moodswing from one extreme to another, all the while Eva puts herself at fault for his behavior and beats herself up.<br /><br />I'm sick of these unhealthy relationships being illustrated in these books and I was so sad to see Gideon and Eva fall to the wrong side of the tracks into the same categories as Bella and Edward and Anastasia and Christian Grey. I thought this book was different-- I really did. I don't know if I'm in for another book unless Eva or Gideon or hopefully both of them gets their shit together.<br /><br />In addition, the plot becomes extremely trivial and episodic, driven by petty bouts of jealousy by both parties involved. Their relationship neither moves forward or backwards, really; the ending was a total cop out and made me feel cheated. ******SPOILER ALERT***** I did not see Gideon as the type of man who would kill someone. It came out of the left field and the ending, in no means, justified any of the brutal shit that Eva or Gideon did to hurt each other, even if they are both damaged people. I believe that both parties were smarter than that.<br /><br />On a lighter note, the side characters are very likable and Day's writing remains strong. Everything else kind of sucked and I felt really let down.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|Whenever I've mentioned this movie to my friends I've always told them that \\"I've seen it, I love it, and I would never watch it again.\\" I'm more then willing to lend them the DVD, but I won't watch it with them. I've been a horror fan for years, and when you love the genre enough to step outside of the American schlockfests that get wheeled into theaters it's a delight to find the trends that are occurring in foreign horror. I'm not entirely sure why France has lent itself to such good horror, but the French New Wave is like a graduate school for those sick of the tedium of Paranormal Activity and Saw, willing to redefine the limits of horror in a truly inspired and creative way unlike the dull nihilistic extremism of something like The Human Centipede films. A lot of people cite High Tension, Frontier(s), Inside, and Martyrs as the hallmarks of the genre, and for the most part this is true. Martyrs is different because more than all the others it is an endurance test of a film, and while it could absolutely be categorized as so-called \\"torture porn\\" it chooses to use the conventions of the genre to enhance the structure of the film rather than wallow around in gore (although there is plenty of that).<br /><br />  Its really difficult to proceed much farther in the review without dancing into some kind of spoiler, but I assure you that I will stick to plot events that occur in the first ten minutes of the film. We have Lucie, a young girl who was violently tortured for weeks as a child who managed to escape but is pursued by a mysterious demonic creature who seems to want to inflict pain upon her. Years later Lucie believes that she has found those people who were responsible for her torture and bursts into their house with a shotgun, killing a couple and their son and daughter. She then calls her childhood friend Anna, who is panicked that Lucie might have found the wrong people, to come help her. That's as far as I can go, and I believe that its all the information that you should have going into the film (if you're curious enough to look up the trailer on Youtube, don't, it spoils everything and makes the movie look like its something that it's not).<br /><br />  Director Pascal Laugier approaches his material with relentless, cold efficiency and interlaces his plot with a sense of real mystery that is intoxicating as a viewer. Even at the film's most harrowing points, when you have to look away from the screen (if this honestly doesn't happen for you, see a psychiatrist), you can sense that the scene has a purpose and you find yourself saying \\"it'll be over in a minute, I have to see what comes next.\\" Every character has a motivation that is understandable on some level (even some sick levels), every actor enlisted performs their job in a masterful way (especially Catherine Begin, who's midpoint monologue is among the most chilling in cinema) and nobody is simply evil for evil's sake. In the film's second half the plot takes on philosophical overtones, which climax in a gut-wrenching ending that left me staring at the credits trying to collect myself for a good five minutes.<br /><br />  I don't have nightmares from slasher movies anymore. Jason and Leatherface can brandish as many knives and chainsaws as they want and I'll usually just eat popcorn and forget about it once I leave the theater. I had nightmares after watching Martyrs. It's a kind of movie that gets under your skin, and if that sounds like a good time for you then its a movie that's worth your time. It is rumored to be gearing up for an American remake under the hand of Daniel Stamm (The Last Exorcism) and from the producers of Twilight. With those clues alone it feels like they might try to cram it into a PG-13 box (as it is, its pushing NC-17), and Stamm has stated that he will be changing the ending if the movie does indeed get made in order to make the movie more upbeat. I can absolutely assure you that doing that will ruin everything that makes this movie special, and so I highly recommend watching this before the American remake spoils it.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|This was an amusing 3 star pleasantly acted cute script until the last 1/4 of the film.  4 to 5 star from then on to end a very fun movie.  Very Quentin Tarantino.  Like in From Dusk til Dawn when it suddenly becomes a graphic vampire flic partway through, [spoiler alert] as in a martial arts graphic the little girl dressed like a Japanese schoolgirl... You get the drift.  Great characters.  Worth the free watch on Amazon Prime
B00746O3X8|4.0|I just got mine and used it the first time last night at a football game. It was great and easy to wear. It is also nice in that I can now carry 2 cameras and have both of them available. It will take a little practice switching between them, but it is alot better then and faster than trying to change lens during the game. The safety straps is also a big plus. I am very pleased and can not wait to use it again today. I am thinking about getting a couple more for Christmas presents.<br /><br />Just a quick add on to my comment. I have now used it at several sporting events and even had it on for over three hours. I will never shoot a sporting event with out it. It allows you to rest your hands and arms during breaks in the action but still have both cameras ready.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just like the games at the arcades. I could play this game for hours.I would like the coins to replenish a little quicker.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|This, this is a beautiful book, every page a masterpiece.  The stories of Vida and Margaret intertwine artfully.  The characters are wonderfully engaging, the plot ever twisting so that one could never guess what was going to happen next - though it leaves one in breathless anticipation.  I laughed, I cried, I wished it didn't have to end.  The writing itself is marvelous.  I have been avidly devouring books since I was two years old; at twenty-seven I've read literally thousands of books in the last twenty-five years.  I can honestly say, this is one of the best I have ever read, by far.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It started off in a way that I wasn't getting into. But that soon changed. I am in the middle of the novel now and riveted. Lol they're asking for product links. I have no products. I am just liking the book.

0545265355|5.0|If the movie is half as good as the books (which I doubt) it will be a box office smash.  Loved the three books and found it very interesting to think about how our society can change and what we become use to in time.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|Ok, I FINALLY found a Blu-ray that works with my recent laptop, an HP Pro-Book 4530s, with another 4g Ram for the movies and games. 8 total RAM.<br /><br />This was a whole weekend process. Tiger Direct where I bought the laptop, couldn't make it run with Titanic, either. I LOVE extras, btw, for the most part. Not the commentaries, good ones are few and far between, but special FX tricks and stuff.<br /><br />\\"And a little child shall lead them:\\" I finally said, it's a store, let's find something this film works with and use that program. We found the Power DVD 12 on a Sony gaming laptop for 1200. The Arc Soft is a coaster, btw. HP really blanked up, there. Works with some things, not Titanic.<br /><br />I had to buy the program, but I'm going to HI soon, and I REALLY want this to work by then. So, it's on sale for 82.00 now. Follow prompts, keep a printout of your key info (you'll need it) upload through your email, type in the keys, and away you GO. It skips a tiny bit when you start, may skip if you pause it to check something. It will come back. Try to hang out for the whole hour; the aprox. time of each chunk of special feature so far.<br /><br />I used my ADORED Bose QC 12 noise cancelling headphones with an ext. Sound Blaster sound card (phones 299.00, ext. card, maybe 40.00). Nagging wife, plane rides, loud kids? Oh, you can't hear a damn thing with these things on. :)!!!! Even better, THEY can't hear YOU right next to you! :)!!! I have a nagging husband, and he always thinks I can hear him complain :) I turn down just enough so he doesn't gripe: \\"You never listen...!\\" Wah, wah, wah...just like a woman, he'd say.<br /><br />Ok, I never cried for deleted scenes before. I started with the hour of \\"Reflections on Titanic.\\" I had tears in my eyes from all the beauty in the sound, costumes, FX, everything. The soloist on the James Horner instrumental Titanic theme at the end gave me spine chills. As I said, make sure you are ready to watch the whole hour per chunk at once. Then I went to \\"Deleted Scenes.\\" Cried endlessly from one end to the other, esp. at the end.<br /><br />Scenes that got me, Rose's slow-mo flowing dress in the boiler room. The clip of the sounds of shooting and the ship's dying creaking and groaning. It ROARS with these headphones. It's ALIVE. Don't even bother without them. The gentle clinking on China in the water. The flares, color and sound. Molly Brown rowing made me laugh. Fabrizio and Helga; their love story.<br /><br />Bothered by minor issues: the lifejacket put on the kid who ignored the ice warnings would've got caught in his headphone cord. Willing to go along with it. Cord wound up OVER the jacket. Wrong, but Ok. I don't think anyone would give up a lifejacket if they just got off a sunk ship. Had issues with no one finding Rose on the Carpathia. They'd have been on there a few days, and even a BIG boat isn't THAT big. I've been. They would've looked under \\"Dawson,\\" don't'cha think? But Ok again. I think it's like the stuff in the old Twilight Zone show. You don't care that Burgess Meredeth might have been irradiated right after he left the bank vault; the script was iconic, so who cares??<br /><br />The dogs on the boat running of course, bothered me. Real dogs would've been a bit more panicked. They're not stupid. Could've used CGI there, but it was an outtake.<br /><br />As for anyone who says Cal is overdone, trust me, LOTS of men are just like that. Ask a woman. That's just what he'd do, because like a rapist, it's about CONTROL and WINNING, not sex. Not love. If they find someone who goes along with it AT ALL, they will be unrelenting to \\"get her back.\\"<br /><br />I don't mind the Celine Dion song. She IS actually singing. Auto-tune is no different from lip-synching, and why's it OK for Grammys to go to \\"singers\\" who use it both recorded and live?? Which is 90+ percent of all \\"performers?\\" But Milli Vanilli's bad?? It's the same thing! Celine's vibrato, well, that's a real singer, andAuto-tune apparently can't make that happen. In fact, I can't get rid of my vibrato when I'd like to. Some songs are flatter in sound.<br /><br />I think the Horner song in stunning with a real piano. I don't like it with Rose on the ship with the diamond where it's a keyboard.<br /><br />Lots of stuff that was cut is rightfully cut, but much is still very moving. It's still all stunning in terms of cinematography and sound design as well as FX.<br /><br />I didn't feel much as I do now, before I quit drinking and any other type of drug. The feelings scared me at first, but now I see so much more--it's why we all came here to this life. To love, to feel, even to cry and feel hurt. I was so afraid to feel, and today I felt like it was so needless. I loved crying from one end to the other, and it's not my habit at all. I normally hate the type of things that try to manipulate that. I felt more alive, closer to God. I didn't feel sad, I felt MOVED. There's a difference. All those who suffered on such a gorgeous ship. Pointless deaths. I felt they were all alive on God's other joyous plane, and that they...knew us, and loved that we cared, even a hundred years after they died. That they loved that their lives MATTERED; isn't that why we all do EVERYTHING? Why we have kids, make money, give money away?? To not be forgotten.<br /><br />WELL worth the wait and the extra cost of the Power DVD 12.<br /><br />Highly, HIGHLY recommend it !Auto-tune apparently can't make that happen.

1469984202|5.0|The Wool Omnibus edition is an absolutely stunning series of books. You never know which way the story is going and you are always surprised and engrossed in the next development in the character's lives.(Not always a happy surprise.) Mr. Howey is able to immerse you totally into the world he has created. The characters are believable and as the overall story unfolds and as more and more is revealed,it all hangs together with its own internal logic. You really do not know how the story will end. Just like in real life.....although the story does not take place in our reality.<br />I have to say this is one of the best books I have ever read for its storytelling and excitement.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This all is amazing and i love how it gives me lots of cool ideas about things. But when i try to open this app, it takes me about 7 tries because it doesnt respond abd it has to shut itself down. That is why i had to give it some stars down. Other than that I love this app!

B000SEIK2S|5.0|As the title says, Scalzi's first novel is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as \\"The Forever War\\" and \\"Starship Troopers\\". The plot is reminiscent of Haldeman, and the writing style reads a lot like Heinlein.<br />Highly recommended.

B00914JWSW|4.0|I have been a Streisand fan since 1978 (Greatest Hits Vol. 2). One of the things I have always loved most about Barbra's singing style is the way she can belt out a song. Not just holding those amazing notes, but also the real emotion she delivers. No one except for Judy Garland can compare to her. While she still sounds good at age 70, that element of her singing is not what it once was. So when I heard songs like \\"Home\\" and \\"Being good isn't good enough\\", I was in heaven. IMO, these songs showcase Barbra at her best.<br /><br />I didn't care for \\"Mother and Child\\" or the alternate version of \\"With one more look at you\\" (the version on the A Star is Born soundtrack is much better).<br />Regardless, I would highly recommend this CD to any Streisand fan.
B0058YPG1G|2.0|Frustrating CDs...they would skip inconsistently or would not play at all. I tried to exchange them through Amazon, but read that was not possible...so, they are just sitting on the shelf. Episodes I was able to view were great!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|The Call Of The Wild is a really good book despite the fact that it is historical fiction. Although some parts were rather sad and depressing, it was extremely interesting and kept me on the edge of my seat. However, I would recomend this book for ages eleven and up because of mild violence and gore through out the book. But other than that, it is a really good book.<br /><br />It is about a dog named Buck who happily lives a happy life at Judge Miller's house in the Santa Clara Valley located in California. Buck is kidnapped and is sold to be a sled dog in the Alaskan area in the Klondike Gold Rush. Buck has to overcome the harsh conditions and struggle to survive through the cold Arctic regions. Buck struggles for mastery and eventually kills another dog in the hope to be master of the team. Buck eventually returns to his wild home of his ancesters and becomes an amazing legend at the end of the book. Buck heard the call of the wolf in the wild and felt that urge to return there. He eventually returns to the wild at the end of the book. This is why it is called The Call Of The Wild.

B0084IG8TM|4.0|I am usually not into the teen angst movies featuring a majority of young actors, who all look perfect and over-act hmm ( Sounds like the Twilight series ). But this movie was pretty<br />good. The main actress Jennifer Lawrence did a good job playing Katniss Everdeen. I actually grew to like this chacter. The action was also fairly<br />well done. I am looking foward to the next installement. Just dont water it down with needless romance and cutsey drama.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is fun when I play the winning game and the computer doesn't finish it for you. A random game is just to hard for me because I don't really do the random game.
1781161313|3.0|This book has allot of information but I felt the art work was only fare. No fold-outs and hardly any color panels. Its too bad DK Publishing,<br />out of the UK, didnt do this book. They have been doing all the Marvel and DC comic book manuals and their style is breath-taking. If you are a<br />fan of the Alien movie series and just love all things Alien, I would get this book but if you are just a dabbler, I would buy this book used.
0345803485|4.0|It is a slow start book. It gets your interest real fast by page 120 LOL. It is definitely a women's book. However, some are offended by it's content.  Too them I say \\"babies\\" grow up and can't you read the back of the book: EROTIC ROMANCE
B0088749CW|2.0|I bought this movie on plain DVD because  I thought the cover looked interesting, the sleeve details also looked interesting and of course Jessica Biel. I am dissapointed. At first it started out alright. But, being a fan of splatter and higher tension horror, I was disapointed. The movie never truly revealed enough for my taste. By the time the ending credits where rolling, the film made very little impact to me, just another ho hum effort to create a watered down ( not even horror ) thriller.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put it down read all three books in a week a beautiful love story.  If you focus on the sex you'll miss the story
B007UPNA6Y|1.0|Very disapointed with this offering. It must be very difficult to maintain what has previously been a winning formula without becoming repetitive. However, the the good guy kicking butt and prevailing against all odds is why Reacher fans buy the books and this attempt to tell a story with little action until the very end was quite boring. Perhaps it is time for big Jack to walk off into the sunset and make way for a new character.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Expected more than just a long saga. It was like reading an episode of East Enders. Everyone knows each other and it's all doom and gloom. So many characters, week story line and hard going. Disappointing. Best to stick to fantasy JK.
0316228532|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book but it was so disappointing.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying I'm not really a Harry Potter fan.  I read the first volume, really only to see what all the fuss was about.  It was well written and had a great plot.  But I don't like fantasy or science fiction or whatever category you might put the Harry Potter series into.  Just not my thing.<br /><br />But given that Rowling is immensely talented, I thought a novel for adults would be great.<br /><br />I struggled and struggled to finish this book.  Unfortunately, it is filled with too many characters, most of whom are not likeable at all.  In order to care about their daily trials and issues in their town, you first have to LIKE them as people and CARE about them.  Not so in this book.<br /><br />The issues were really so petty and boring...and I live in a very small town so I understand that petty things in small towns can become huge issues. But, that doesn't make the petty things interesting enough to be the basis of a novel. I'm sorry I spent so much for this book!<br /><br />Actually, I blame Rowling's editors.  Unfortunately, when a writer is VERY successful and popular, editors seem to leave their work alone, assuming that whatever they do will be good.<br /><br />Her editor should have stepped in and make her cut some characters and given redeeming values to others.<br /><br />If this is representative of her writing for adults, Rowling should not continue in that genre.  This book failed on so many levels.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this on my kindle fire..play for hours..easy and fun and don't have any problems with it at all ..
B0015DROBO|3.0|I really don't understand what all the fuss has been about.  This book was \\"OK\\", but certainly not worthy of all the buzz around it.  Especially disappointing was the ending.  No spoiler here, but don't start into this expecting a fulfilling conclusion, it leaves you feeling cheated and empty. It actually felt like the author did not know how to tie it all together into a satisfying ending, so he just quit writing.  I do not recommend this book.
B00008977N|5.0|I have been a Peter Gabriel fan for decades. I remember seeing his tour twice in the 80's.  Back in the days of concert fever, all I wanted to do was see bad azz concerts.  The show he performs with outstanding band members is among the best I have seen. The show is awesome and Peter Gabriel is really into performing.  All over the stage at times dancing all around with props and other times playing various instruments. I saw this DVD about 6 years ago and was blown away. It's time to watch it again.

B008I3QZKU|4.0|Once again I begin by saying that the reason I liked The Killers in the first place is because they reminded me of some of my favorite new wave bands growing up like U2, The Cars, The Cure, Duran Duran, etc. That much hasn't changed. \\"Battle Born\\" has plenty of 80's nostalgia in it. It also offers nothing surprising.<br /><br />You know, the more I think about the bands I grew up with, the more it becomes apparent that today's bands are seriously lacking in musicianship. I mean, just look at U2, for example. Their fourth album was \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" which offered up \\"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\\"--a classic now. The Edge was emerging as an innovative guitarist with a definitive sound, which would propel the band from just a run of the mill new wave band into a full fledged classic rock band. Well, where is the musicianship in The Killers, exactly? To me, and I know fans won't like this, the band is merely treading water on \\"Battle Born\\". They even borrow Daniel Lanois (of U2 fame), and it just doesn't work.<br /><br />The problem with being The Killers is that they boxed themselves in from the beginning as a retro band, or post punk or indie as it's called now. Well, when U2 started they emerged as a new wave band in the new wave era and then grew out from there. The Killers....well, they started as a retro band, and where can you go from there? They're still retro. Except now they've incorporated Coldplay and Snow Patrol into their sound.<br /><br />What all this means is, \\"Battle Born\\" is good, but nothing fresh or original. It's just good, and that's all that can be said about it. Every Killers album has some really good tracks and here it is definitely \\"Flesh And Bone\\", \\"Runaways\\", \\"Here With Me\\", \\"A Matter Of Time\\", \\"Heart Of A Girl\\", and \\"From Here On Out\\", plus I enjoyed the two bonus tracks \\"Carry Me\\" and \\"Prize Fighter\\". But the problem with \\"Battle Born\\" is the same problem with all their previous albums--too many songs that aren't quite up to snuff. Songs like \\"The Way It Was\\", \\"The Rising Tide\\" and \\"Be Still\\" detract from the rest of the album and should have been b-sides.<br /><br />Also, the band is still struggling to shed it's retro skin. I mean, \\"From Here On Out\\" is a dead ringer for The Eagles, and \\"Prize Fighter\\" sounds like it lifted Rocky's \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" right out of 1976.<br /><br />\\"Hot Fuss\\" was good for reminding everyone of the power of the new wave/romantic movement, but now, three albums later, it's time to change boys. And, where is the musicianship? Where is the distinctive guitar playing? The innovative keyboard playing? The drums with a distinctive edge? The Killers are becoming interchangeable with so many other bands around today. They need to do something to set themselves apart from the pack.<br /><br />So, I liked \\"Battle Born\\", don't get me wrong. But it's no more than four stars. In listening to all of the previous Killers albums leading up to \\"Battle Born\\" I feel the band has not yet made it's classic five star album yet.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Battle Born\\" compares to The Killers previous works:<br /><br />2004 Hot Fuss: Four Stars<br />2006 Sam's Town: Four Stars<br />2008 Day & Age: Four Stars<br />2012 Battle Born: Four Stars<br /><br />2007 Sawdust: Three Stars<br /><br />2010 Flamingo (Brandon Flowers): Four StarsSongs like \\"The Way It Was\\", \\"The Rising Tide\\" and \\"Be Still\\" detract from the rest of the album and should have been b-sides.<br /><br />Also, the band is still struggling to shed it's retro skin.

1600966756|5.0|In fact, I've read this book probably 5-6 times.  The elfland chapter and the maniac and the paradoxes I've read and referred to even many more times than that.<br /><br />GK Chesterton has a great writing style, it's kind of dream-like, like what I'd imagine the inner-dialogue of poets to be, with twists and turns that are not so much like a whirl-wind or racing thoughts, but rather breezy from one thought to the next, and strangely poetic.<br /><br />Chesterton has a reputation for both spotting and employing paradox, which I think plays a large part not only in his wit, but also in articulating Christian thought and perception that is generally difficult for the average Christian to articulate.  Chesterton also has a knack for irony, so if you like paradox and irony, you'll at the very least appreciate the mind of GK Chesterton.<br /><br />The only hard things about Chesterton have to do with his day and age in contrast to our own, particularly in areas of language/grammatical differences that 100 years can make and the references he makes to people and events of his time that are relatively obscure to our day and age.  Regardless, his ideas still get across and are comprehensible and thought-provoking, and are only briefly interrupted by some obscure reference or idiom, or disjointing grammar.<br /><br />Chesterton is idealistic, and has a naivety that seems deliberate, like he chooses what one might call a 'naive idealism' simply because it's better or more beautiful, and not because he's just some naive simpleton.  He definitely not naive, he went down the other road, and my guess is that his love for art and beauty and goodness is what is responsible for him not staying on that road out of repulsion.  He's not a fuddy-duddy, he's just someone that had discovered the folly of the anti-Christian world to the point where he could barely even take them seriously anymore and keep a straight face.<br /><br />Chesterton has many relevant things to say to our day andage, the 3 chapters I cited earlier are in my estimation probably the most relevant, since I go back to them repeatedly.<br /><br />I've read just about all of Chesterton's books, but this is the book I've read multiple times and will likely read multiple times more.  And there are few books by any author that I can say the same thing about.  Every Christian should read this, and...in fact, everyone should read it.  I personally think this book is far superior to Mere Christianity (a book I've read once, and enjoyed, but never touched again)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have been waiting since last October to get this book and I am extremly pleased with it. Of course now that I have read it I can't wait till next year! I would highly recommend this book to any Rick Riordan fan.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I was so stoked when I recieved these as a birthday gift from my boyfriend to replace my worn out pyrex ones. I have been racking my brain as to why I never bought this set for myself sooner. This collection is so great and the colors are bright and vivid and bring life to my rather dull apartments kitchen. I love the fact that when i go to set a utinsel down it doesnt touch the counter so my counters remain clean. And i love that it feels sturdy, not flimsey. I am in love with this line and plan to add to my collection. I highly recomend this set to everyone!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I recently built a new computer with the AMD FX-8120, I bought into the 8 core junk they offer. Well after spending all the money I was not happy with my machine, it wasn't as fast as I had expected and games ran under 60 fps on max settings. Then I traded the 7870 gfx card for a gtx 670. No dice... Still slow ... I'm thinking what in the world is wrong so I looked up some benchmarks of processors and found the problem. Out came the 8120 and in went the 3570k. World of Warcraft performance went from fps in the 40s on high/max settings to over 100 with all max settings. The computer runs so much faster its crazy. Oddly, my boot time increased by about 5 seconds, but I can live with that.<br /><br />Intel does things right, spend an extra 25% and get 2x the quality and performance. Not to mention it uses so much less power than AMD that it will make up for the difference in price within a year.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book, for me, went through every emotion I could have had.  The story, some may think, is about a man who is wreckess and out of control but for me it was a story of an incredible man, who faced many giants going through life.  I read of a determination to endure and become the best he could be whether a soldier, husband, father, or son.  A person I am proud to have gotten to know through this book. Thanks for sharing his story.

0393327345|5.0|I don't care what everybody else says, I cried over this book. And not because I cared for the characters (I did), and not because I cared for the story (I did), no. I cried because of sentences like \\"The bruised, old fruit way my face had collapsed, you would've thought I was dead.\\" and \\"In the heat of the kitchen, clouds of cold fog waterfall out from the bottom of the fridge and pool around Tyler's feet.\\" and \\"Streetlight along the boulevard comes through the sales agreement in the window and prints \\"AS IS\\" on Tyler's cheek.\\" I cried because Chuck could show one man's despair with a simple scene like reading an IKEA catalogue in the bathroom. I cried because Chuck took the joke of our generation's existence, the faceless cookie-cutter pre-sorted pre-packaged direct-marketed branded-labeled everything, and spun it into a story so big - it required whole buildings to blow up.<br /><br />In short, I loved it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|so glad I got this game. the best app of the day ive ever downloaded hands down! I have become addicted. its a great twist to your traditional match 3 games and its really fun.
0671042858|4.0|Can you write a whole book about one 9 year old girl being lost in the woods for 9 days? Stephen King can. Can you make a snap of a branch in the dead of the night make the hairs rise on your neck? Stephen King can. Can you wrap it all up in a metaphor of a baseball game and deliver a winning throw just when you thought all was lost? Stephen King can. Apart from slowing down in places where I couldn't understand the baseball references (didn't grow up with this game, in fact, I still don't get it), and apart from some things the girl utters that don't quite belong in a 9 year old's vocabulary, it was an excellent read with a masterful payoff at the end.

0812550706|4.0|Ender Wiggin is special. So special that his brother hates him, his sister loves him, and the world wants him to become the next perfect general to defeat the Buggers who started a 100 year long war against the human kind. Only Ender is 6 years old and he doesn't want to kill anyone. All he wants is to be normal. He doesn't get the chance.<br /><br />It took me a while to read this book. I'd read it, then stop, read, stop again, think, then get back to reading, repeat. At times the story seemed too dense and felt too slow, but always it would pick up. A parable on a child's game, the accidental discovery of an ant hill gone wrong. A tale of a desperate move on the part of those who forgot what it's like to play. And a story of a gifted child whose genius walls him up in a cocoon of loneliness and premature adulthood.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I suppose I was expecting something absolutely extraordinary from the author having been utterly enthralled with her Harry Potter books- and I am over 60!  It is written very well, she really does have a superb turn of phrase, and  she has tried to touch upon many big problems facing society today.  But the end was so dark and so depressing.  I thought it petered out somewhat and was expecting something a little more triumphant: reinforcing the social services, establishing child care facilities, dealing with the horrific housing problem.  And the pettiness of local councils!!!  I am glad I read it and i have recommended it to others but I would not read it again.
B00008ACIN|5.0|Here's what's written on the inner sleeve of this album (only applies to vinyl):<br />\\"All songs on this record recorded to eight track reel to reel [...]<br />No computers were used during the writing, recording, mixing or mastering of this record\\"<br /><br />Very good!
B007NESBK2|5.0|I saw Sade's concert live and have to say this DVD was even better; probably because I was sitting too far away at the concert.<br />The quality and sound of the Blu-ray is amazing.  The background videos were very beautiful and matched well with her seeing as if it was watching a live concert video.  If you are a fan of Sade, buy this DVD without a doubt as she sees most of her most popular songs.  I have 2 other Sade DVD and this blows away any of her old DVD based on sound and video quality.  You won't go wrong buying this.  You'll treasure it.  One of the best Blu-ray concerts that I have and I have over 30 of them.

B009G8GRX6|5.0|I have been a fan of Muse for a very long time, so when I was seriously anticipating the release of this album. And it did not disappoint. The 2nd Law starts off with a head-banging Kashmir-reminiscing Supremacy, then turns into a Queen-influenced Madness. This album is very different from their previous work; Showbiz, Absolution, Origin of Symmetry, Black Holes and Revelations, and Resistance were all full rock albums, while The 2nd Law has more electronic elements. Like Resistance, this album ends with a multi-part song, but rather than being orchestral pieces they are more on the dubstep side. Now, many people complained about Muse deviating from their original style, but artists grow and develop throughout their careers, and Muse wanted to try something new. Will their next album sound the same? Who knows? Maybe yes, maybe no, but either way, I will definitely listen to it. All in all, I'd give The 2nd Law an 8.5/10; the album was definitely worth the wait, and I wasn't let down, but there was something missing that I couldn't place my finger on. But it is nice to see Muse trying something new.<br /><br />Best Tracks:<br />Supremacy<br />Madness<br />Panic Station<br />Big Freeze

B001QC9PSO|4.0|My five-year-old grandson would give it 5 stars I'm sure.  It's a new generation re-discovering the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and collecting all the \\"stuff\\".  These older movies are fun, with some humor and the violence is not so \\"in your face\\" as most current movies. And in the end, the good guys always win.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I do not understand the popularity of this book. After forcing myself to read it, I am still confused. The plot is so thin, the characters unappealing, and the dialogue hum-drum. The story moves slowly, and I just can't read anymore than I have.

B000Y0VTV0|5.0|I grabbed this because after reading about a scene in this episode, I realized that of all of the seasons of SG-1 it was an episode I either missed, or at the very least, completely and totally forgot about.<br /><br />It's hard to review an episode of a tv show that's been out for over 10 years....It's been reviewed to death already.<br /><br />The summary of my opinion of the episode.<br /><br />I laughed, a lot. I enjoyed it. End of<br /><br />Most SG-1 fans have probably seen it (at least 2-3 times) but if you are new to the show, I recommend starting with Season 1 Ep. 1 Children of the Gods(Part 1-2 here on Amazon) and watch them in order. Take a couple of weekends(or your days off if they aren't on a weekend) and watch a season or 2 each weekend. By the time you are done watching, you too will feel empty inside, knowing there are no more awesome stories to come from Stargate SG-1. Then you can start watching Stargate Atlantis(5 seasons) and then Stargate Universe(2 seasons) plus the 2 SG-1 Movies Continuum and Ark of Truth.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Plot was engaging throughout, but the shifting perspectives were hard to follow. Some of the story lines were a but lackluster as well.

0671027573|1.0|I gave this book 1 star because i couldn't even finish reading it.  The story line was ridiculous. The premise that 4 women make is list of attributes for the perfect man and news media would want to report on this is way too far fetched.  Their embarrassment on being found out is also ridiculous.  What is this 1920?  My husband would be running around with a \\"Mr. Perfect\\" tee shirt, letting everyone assume that he was everything on the list (including 10 inches) because i married him.  The women's lives were not realistic and the main character's relationship with the neighbor was also not realistic.  It was ridiculous.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Diana Krall is my favorite singer! At least she was until I heard this album.  Her Jazz albums were much better suited to her vocal style.  Plus the instrumental mix is obnoxious and too loud.  It is ofter hard to hear the singing over the thumping bass, and drums and gross guitar playing. If Diana is trying to branch out from her great Jazz singing, she needs to branch in a different direction!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can't believe I spent money on this piece of trash! I wanted to see what the fuss was about. I was so disappointed to find that there was nothing to this book but sex. There is barely any character development; the plot is skeletal; and the ending is just a marketing scheme to get you to buy book 2. I could have gotten more out of a cheap harlequin romance novel. And EL James needs to find a thesaurus - certain words were used ad nauseum, like \\"flushed\\" and  \\"murmur,\\" just to name a couple. I cannot believe a major motion picture is going to be made about this, when it is, at best, a semi-decent porno. The author must be laughing all the way to the bank.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I watched this using Amazon Video on Demand. I actually joined Amazon Local and got a free coupon for a $2.00 discount on any video I wanted. So, of course, wanting to see this since the trailer came out... I decided to put the credit towards this film. The code was super easy to use!  I'm so glad I rented from here.<br /><br />It was so easy. Much easier than going to Blockbuster or some brick and mortar store. I don't know how store rentals could even compete. The video played instantly and quickly.  My credit was accepted and the video resolution was very good. I had no streaming problems. I also paused the video a couple times to get some drinks or use the restroom.<br /><br />Marvel's The Avengers is a really well written action film. I would expect nothing less of Joss Whedon. He is, of course, famous for making high art action (like Buffy, Firefly, Serenity, etc). Avengers is no exception. All of the super hero characters were like-able and interesting. Each had a back story and depth, as well as enough flaws to keep the film moving.  To top it off, this was like a feel good film without being cheesy.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I will just say this has the moral lesson of Captain America, the muscles of Thor, the beauty of Black Widow, the humor of Iron Man, and a little flourish that is pure Whedon SciFi.  All of the good elements of the previous films seemed to be incorporated here and there were no dull moments.<br /><br />I may end up buying this film.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A very well written, engaging story of life in the 1800's in the south. If you have visited any plantations or Mt Vernon, the story becomes even more attainable.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Action in the book was slow, and did not live up to what is expected from Mr. Follett. However the book, although fiction, offers a lot of historical detail of WWI, the politics leading up to it, and the beginning of the fallout from the war.  This history is given through the eyes of several main characters from different walks of life who of course have differing agendas.  Many of the reasons given for the war differ from what we were taught in American schools.

B008NW67E0|5.0|This is not your everyday music, sounds a lot better. It's unique and a style all its own; this is a great band to listen to.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my husband got me hooked on this game and i love it! its addicting and challenging. it gets your mind working! i play it all the time!
B009K52HN4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It never drags on and keeps you on your toes. I can watch this over and over!
B008Y6PHDM|5.0|Other musicians should buy this video and take notes on how to make great music. Just goes to show that there is still real talent out there these days.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you are sitting on the fence about spending 9.99 on REFLECTED IN YOU, sit no more.This awesome book will have your mind and body on full blast, because it is that damned good.This a story full of torment damage and love and all the things it takes to get there.It is a story that is so very life relateable. I had to pause several times and think about a few things in my own past and present.In my humble opinion i think i now know why the name crossfire is so signifiant to the trilogy stories.Once you step into the middle of any crossfires in any of life's situations you are never the same and you are bound to get burned a little or a lot.What truly matters in the end is how you come out of the crossfires and live your life going forward.well darlings we won't know if i am on the right track until the next book in the trilogy comes out.All i have to say is bring on the next set of wicked people in Gideon's and Eva's lives and watch how they too will be amonished as all before.Gideon's and Eva's love will not be denied ever.Get the book curl up on the couch sink into the cushions. It's going to be a loooong night.REFLECTED IN YOU is worth every cent. Happy reading!
B004LUS390|5.0|I didn't use this for a long time because the drawing tip options are confusing to find. Once I found the user forums (users helping each other), I found the preferences and love the program now. Normally I debit a star for extremely poor documentation, but this app is so badass, that outweighs the pain of figuring it out.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I think this book takes you away from anything related to S&M.  It was more a love story with a hint of erotica. Its a good read especially for the mild. I was able to put the book down for days at a time. Not a good sign. But overall it was ok.
B000002V1D|5.0|Papers In The Roadside Tell Of Suffering and Greed; Feared Today, Forgot Tomorrow/ Here Beside The News of Holy War and Holy Need; Ours is Just a Little Sorrow Talk- Ordinary World<br /><br />It's not 1983 and I am not a suburban teenage white female with the hots for John Taylor, so my Duran Duran experience is a different one.<br /><br />Sure I saw The Reflex and Wild Boys videos on MTV but in my honest opinion they were not for me ( I owned The Power Station cassette and it blew any early DD album away in my opinion).<br /><br />I listened to the whole Big Thing album and the only question that crossed my mind was if Andy Taylor was a better guitarist than Warren Cuccurullo and this album answered that question and many more.<br /><br />I was in an emotional transition period when I heard Ordinary World on the radio and the chorus really stuck with me and made me question if this was the Duran Duran MTV forced on me a decade prior and when I was able to get the lyrics to the whole song I was in total disbelief and had to get ths album.<br /><br />This album should be considered a concept album, because all the songs collectively told a very great story overall (you have got to translate the lyrics to \\"Breath After Breath\\") and Sin Of The City is a great song to close this album with.<br /><br />This album showed me, for Duran Duran, there is life after MTV.
B0087HT36U|4.0|great game..more screens please. i enjoy these type of games. they pass the time when you are in limbo...i reccomend this to all family members. my son and i work on these together and have a blast. keep up the great work
B004RJMUJO|2.0|Not really an adult game, but my six year old likes it.  Swipe to cut fruits, but don't cut the bombs.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Om Nom is a great character.  Game is good for kids and adults to pass the time, though my 6 year old gets over-matched pretty quickly as you go up levels.  Everyone should try this game
B003UBTX6S|5.0|A bit of a slow beging but the book more than makes up for it at the end. COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!
B0034G4P26|5.0|This was good, it is one of those movies you might have to watch a couple times.  You may have missed a joke or something in the background.  The movie looked great on blu-ray.  If you are a Wallace and Gromit fan, you would appreciate it.  Not to mention all the detail that was put into this movie was awesome.  Give it a look, you won't be disappointed.
B004QYTRRS|5.0|Why didn't I hear about this movie sooner?<br /><br />It's a wonderful movie with a great cast. It has everything you would want in a \\"spy novel\\". The Femme Fatal, the clueless protagonist, high tension scenes, and an actual twist that comes out of no where!<br /><br />Watch this movie, you won't be disappointed...unless you're weird.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Totally funny.  I started the book and did not put it down until finished.  Read and Enjoy.  You'll love it!!
0374214913|3.0|While I enjoyed reading this book, ultimately it was a big disappointment.  The mysteries were not solved in a way that made you think you should have seen it coming.  The book on the whole was a very easy read, written almost more like a young adult novel.  The \\"big revel\\" at the end was so flat it was a big let down.<br /><br />I thought many of his characters were hollow shells, placeholders, especially the female characters.  This surprised me as he was obviously trying to promote women in management positions at the same time.<br /><br />Much of the book is pure wish fulfillment.  Wouldn't it be great if you had a job in a mysterious book store, a super rich best friend, you assembled a team for an adventure just like when you used to play RPGs, you had a smart and pretty girl friend, and you got to solve the \\"big mystery?\\"  Oh, and Google is great, they are working to solve all of our problems from collecting knowledge to living for ever.<br /><br />If the author were to write another book on self promotion and how to push your book on the Internet I would certainly buy it.  I think that is where his strengths lie: great concepts, great blurbs, promote the hell out of it, and it sells.  Who cares if the writing is bland and the characters shallow?  I wish he had spent a little more effort writing a a great story rather than imagining what a great story's sales pitch would sound like.  The book that you are expecting to read from the blurbs and the hype is far better than the book you will actually receive if you buy this book.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|As a slavish fan of The xx's debut, Coexist took a bit of getting used to, the way a pair of audiophile speakers need a few weeks of use to start peaking, or the way a great wine often tastes better on the second night. It has taken about 30 listens, but I feel as though I've picked up every contour of this sad, gorgeous recording and can approach it now as a piece. It's a album for nights, first. Oliver Sim and the gang rarely do anything of consequence before 1AM, as the recent Fantastic Man profile pointed out. Days crush the cool, quiet rhythms of this music. It's an album to give into, second. Resistance is ultimately futile, and what makes this music standout is both its sincerity and its realization that in the face of breakup, words often fail. As one song says, \\"I can see it in your eyes / Some thing have lost their meaning.\\" It's a killer line in a work of killer lines. This isn't Sleigh Bells, remember. You have to meet it halfway. It's about subtle changes and contingencies and quiet betrayal and longing. There is really nothing else quite like it. Essential (and gradual) listening.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It's really fun and simple, I love showing friends my favorites and I like creating pins for the public. This is really good for looking up good quality pictures, recipes, ext.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story starts painfully slow,but then keeps getting better....an interesting idea,which I may well employ in some form if my spouse decides to piss me off sufficiently....so you,ve been warned babe.....better behave or you will regret it very much
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very good. Could not put it down.  In suspense til the last page  Can't wait for the next one in December !
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Interesting 2nd book. Can't wait until the 3rd book arrive.  Gideon and Eva has an interesting and sexy relationship.  Love the sexy and spicy roommate Cary.  Wanting to know more about his life, trails and tribulations.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it never gets boring<br />Its super fun I play it in car rides!!<br />Its free so u should denfitly get it there is no reason why you should not get this game!!!!!
B008NB0SQO|1.0|If this is not the original uncut version, and doesn't include the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\", I will not purchase.
B0021G2IJ2|5.0|This album is an awsome album.  I dont care what you say,  if you dont have respect for the passed works of Metallica,  you aint nothing.  If you liked Metallica in the passed ya gotta like this.  I been a fan of Metallica since the Black Album.  Since then if accuired as much of their stuff as i can.  Passed and present.  I'm not rich so I dont have tons of their stuff but I have whatever I can afford.  Metallica is an awsome band!  AND I'll always collect whatever is out their!  Sincerly,  Jess
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Hilarious!  It's a take off on \\"Forest Gump\\" (which I thought was stupid).  This centenarian is cool and calm in the face of murder and mayhem.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|VERY  GOOD  ENTERTAINMENT--  I  LIKED  THE  STORY  LINE, NO  BLOOD  OR  GUTS AND  THE  COMPUTER  USE  WAS  DONE  WELL.  I  DONT  LIKE  HOW  SOME  MOVIES  OVER  USE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND MAKE IT  SO  UNREALISTIC  EVEN  FOR  A  SCI-FI  FILM,  IT  IS  SCIENCE  FICTION  SO  JUST  ENJOY.  THE  CAMERA  ACTION  WAS  NOT  SO  FAST  THAT  YOU  GET  A  HEADACHE  LIKE  SOME  NEWER  MOVIES.  THIS  MOVIE  HAS  NOTHING  TO  DO  WITH  THE  GAME  BATTLESHIP  BUT  DOES  HAVE  A  BATTLESHIP  AS  A  MAJOR  PLAYER.  I  CAN  SAY I  HAVE  NOT  ENJOYED  A  RECENT  MOVIE  MORE.  HIGHLY  RECOMMEND.  ALSO  THE  MUSIC  WAS  AWESOME  AND  THE  NAVY  VETS  WERE  A  GREAT ADDITION
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|All I have to say is WOW. I absolutely could not put this book down. I stayed up until 3 am to finish. The story was wonderful. I felt happy, sad, laughed and cried through tout he entire book. It was unbelieveabilty wonderful!!!  A must read!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|So far this series has been action packed and a further development of the characters from the Percy Jackson series. Some of the myths have been excellent and weaving them together with present times is a stroke of genius. It is sometimes easy to get lost between Greek and Roman gods, and I didn't really get the whole possession spirits, eidolons, but I guess every series has its Jar Jar Binks. Over all great read.
B008EDGBW6|4.0|Well we all know Chris Brown can sing, but what I like about this album is that the composers made some awesome beats for him.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|FIFTY SHADES TRIOLOGY HAS BEEN THE BEST READIND IV'E DONE IN YEARS.  THEY WERE SO GOOD I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO END.  I WISH I HAD KNOWN HALF OF THIS STUFF WHEN I WAS IN MY 20'S.  MEN CAN DO THE WOMEN A GREAT SERVICE BY READING THESE BOOKS AND LEARNING HOW TO PLEASE THEIR WOMEN FROM THEM.  THAT'S THE LUST/LOVE WOMEN ALL WANT BUT SOME MAY NEVER KNOW THAT KIND OF PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION.  DEEJAY
0307387178|4.0|Worth a read.  Interesting character. Author inserts his own story and some others which helps add context.  Well written. I recommend this book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I found this book very inspiring, Yann Martel's writing makes you feel as if you are on the lifeboat with Pi. You have got to read this book!!!
B000VWLEK2|5.0|One of my all time favorite albums of Clapton.  A must have for all fans.  I recently rediscovered \\"The Core'. My new/old favorite Clapton song.
B001W2F730|5.0|First off buy the MP3 singles rather than the album it saves you 1.00 . This album is one that reaches far back into the memory since it was one that defined personally my late high school/college years. For any music lover there are defining moments in our love of music and you know you have one when you wake up 30 years later and hey hey my my is still echoing inside your brain.<br /><br /> A couple side notes<br /><br />Side one (acoustic)<br /><br />What I call Great Sunday Morning Music<br /><br />  \\"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\\"  Like I Said still echoing in my mind 30 yrs later<br />  \\"Thrasher\\" - 5:38 A prophetic look into the mess of commercial farming we now face in our day . Why do we put up with synthetic farming is beyond me?<br />  \\"Ride My Llama\\" - 2:29 Neil loves Indian culture next 2 songs symbolize the feelings he has relating UFO's and Indians as some how connected.<br />  \\"Pocahontas\\" - 3:22 - Great role play thinking of what the Jamestown Colonists must of felt<br />  \\"Sail Away\\" - 3:46 - Reminds me of sitting on a sailboat whale watching off the Calif Coast. If you have done it you know what I mean.<br /><br />Side two (electric)<br /><br />We go from Sunday morning to a pure edge electric set<br /><br />  \\"Powderfinger\\" - 5:30 - Portrait of the Red States of America Guns and Bibles abound.<br />  \\"Welfare Mothers\\" - 3:48- Fitting Theme song for the Obama 2012 Campaign<br />  \\"Sedan Delivery\\" - 4:40- A defining sound of the era . Neil testing the punk waters - Punk was the undercurrent of this time period and Neil loved it<br />  \\"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\\" (Young, Blackburn) - 5:18 One of the Defining Rock Songs of 1979-1980. It dominated FM play lists for years and for good reason.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My 11 yr old son has this game on my phone, Kindle Fire and his Xbox. He is very mechanical and really likes the building aspect of the game. Definitely worth having on many devices to keep him busy when we are waiting somewhere.
6305428042|3.0|This movie is cute, endearing, and funny. I just wish it didn' t overshadow or throw dirt on the innocent people, mostly women and an erderly man who were subjected to cruelty, torture , and one of the worst injustices in history on the say so and connivings of a few brats with the agenda of getting themselves out of trouble with their puritan elders. All I can ask is if you watch this, then also sober yourself by watching The Crucible with Daniel Ray Lewis.
B000IDGDPA|4.0|This movie totally draws you into the lifestyle and glamour of the era, as well as the downfalls.  It was witty, and moving.  Good acting.  totally enjoyed the \\"getaway\\"
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I bought this after going back and forth on it for the longest time trying to decide if its worth the hype. While a good series, its good to keep an open mind and try to see if each character should, or shouldn't, be an Allie, especially in the final book. Each character is well developed and makes one you want to cheer them onto the end, even after the Quarter Quell. It's sad how some of the characters die, some willingly, to save others. I should rent the first movie, and look catch the next two as I'm sure that fans of both the books and the first movie are expecting.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I have never been disappointed by any of John Grisham's novels, and I certainly was not disappointed by The Litigators.  A well-woven, detail-oriented, masterpiece.  Thank you Mr. Grisham for what you consistently provide to this fan.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I hadn't heard of this book until Jon Stewart mentioned it on The Daily Show, and curious, I looked up a summary. I was intrigued by the idea of a book written entirely from progress reports, so I downloaded it onto my Kindle app. I finished it in two days, and made my husband read it immediately. He took maybe three, because it was during the work week. This book is SO remarkably good. It is emotional, funny, and it really makes you think about the way you treat people and the reason that we're all here. Apparently it's taught in a lot of hgih schools, and I genuinely can't believe I missed out on that. It was incredible.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very well written.  Couldn't put it down.  Kept me on the edge of my seat........can't wait for the next book.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My two year old grandson loves this puzzle game. It usually makes him cry when I take it away to prevent eye strain.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I could not put this book down! It's a great love story! Nicolas Sparks always has a way with words.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I bought several copies of this video for myself & friends. It is the most beautiful story I have EVER learned about in my life. Everyone I gave copies to loved it just as much. Sure, you need an entire box of Kleenex to watch it, but is well worth it. Every person on this earth should see it!
B004JXXKWY|5.0|A great bookend to Mr Lewis other 2 books on Wall Street's worthlessness. Mr Lewis, dispite his self proclaimed poor understanding of the system, while he worked in it, provides a ruthless and yet humanistic (i hope is this a real word) insite into a system that is claimed to be a free market but appears to be just a insider shell game, just on line trade or flip a coin.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|I really like this book. I read a lot of technical books but not many novels these days.  Mark, the author, is a technical titan especially within the Microsoft community.  His name alone initially drew me to this book.  Don't let his day job get in the way of purchasing this fictional book.  It was very well written and reminded me a bit of the tv show 24 with a little more realism when it came to discussing technical concepts.<br /><br />The only \\"issue\\" I had with the book is that in my opinion it does end rather abruptly.  I don't want to say more than that so that I don't give the ending away.  If I could give a half star I would give this a 4.5/5.<br /><br />I know that he has another book out there and I will also be buying that book as well.<br /><br />Kent
0307279189|5.0|I love the story, very inspiring.<br />It give me some fuel to run<br />again and again for the long run!<br /><br />Very moving...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool 1 was very good, but short... 2 was better, longer, and answered some questions. By the time I got to 5, I couldn‘t put my Kindle down. Wool is a series of short stories and a novelette about a post-apocalypse vertical city, in a silo buried deep in the ground. The surface world outside is unhabitable, the atmosphere a deadly poisonous toxin. I‘ll not give away any further details; I urge you to get and read “Wool Omnibus Edition“.  I‘ve heard rumors about a “Wool 6“; if true, I will definitely buy it - and anything else by this author.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my opinion on this game is that it is really adicting its also good if you play it because it makes you think its awesome and has a lot of levals on it. and its super fun
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Spent my childhood reading these comics.  This movie brought every bit of them to life.  From the action to the great corny comic book lines.  Loved every minute of it!
6304711905|5.0|The movie came in a very short period of time and worked very well.  Picture was very good quality and nothing was wrong with it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Better than the first book. Lots if twists and turns! Eagerly anticipating book number three on December 31st!!
B0013F1D02|1.0|Watching this on Amazon Prime was a hassle. I had to constantly keep turning down the music which 'Blared' after turning up the sound to hear the dialog, which was barely audible. Is there no standard for these movies? Does amazon ever plan on getting subtitles? This may have helped some.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|...It's my opinion that everything Maynard puts his intricate and complex mind to is genius.  I've seen this band (AND A Perfect Circle, AND Tool...three times...) live, and they are stellar... Save for the first 30 minutes that involved a skit (with the two characters on the cover)... That's 30 minutes I can't get back, otherwise... Stellar.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put the book down...it was a bit of a emotional rolla coaster towards the end but a really good read!! couldn't stop thinking about it for ages afterwards! hurry up book 3!
B004AQR24W|3.0|It was cool, but really a lot of bullets, knives and fists. Truck sounds cool. Big cast for this movie... and thought it would be better. I wouldn't watch it twice, but will check out E2.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|Really enjoyed match.<br />Still not sure how I feel about the double perspective approach.<br />Loved the underground community.<br />Like matched, there are really great concepts here. Not too far fetched.<br /><br />Am eager to see how things progress.<br />My vote is that she does marry Zander, all a part of helping the rising.<br />Can I wait a month?!
B007SGM084|4.0|I love these books. I delight that they are about more than sex, although that is the basis. I would love to read more from Christian's point of view.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book and I couldn't even finish reading it.  I thought the characters were awful and didn't care about them at all. Can't believe the same author wrote this and the Harry Potter series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|LOVED IT!! So much better than the movie! I can't wait to finish the trilogy!! I haven't been this into a set of books since Harry Potter!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is amazing! Could not put it down and can wait for the third one. Strongly recommended. You will absolutely love it!!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you read the 50 Shades trilogy, then you'll have the feeling of Deja Vu, too.  Regardless, I did enjoy this book as well as the first one, Bared to You.  In this book the ending was a surprise - won't spoil it for you, but it will surprise you!!<br />I gave this 4 stars because I don't like the fact that Eva is so whiny and insecure - I would like to see her stronger.<br />I have already pre-ordered #3 that won't be out until next May and I'll be sure to make a comment on the trilogy as a whole.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is very addicting and I like how u get a coin every 30 seconds. when I run out I leave the game on and let it reload and then come back!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Very good read .. i think i  order to persuade the masses it could of been not so technical .. we all aren't phd‘s.. luckily i have taken two college courses on religious studies other wise it would have been an even harder read. as he stated the majority of well educated people already believe “God“ is a delusion why not appeal to the unelightened more. that aside great book
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved every word of this book. It grabs your attention right from the start and doesn't let up till the end. I couldn't wait for the ending but didn't want the book to end.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I grabbed this app back in August after becoming addicted to the black and white version. I'm not sure I could navigate on a phone but on my Xoom it's fantastic. It's the only app I own that I open every day.  Challenging and rewarding (8.3, 8.6, and 8.16 are absolutely amazing!) I've enjoyed many hours of play. I hope the developers keep the updates coming on this one! More, more, more!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is fantastic!<br /><br />I had moments in the book where I just had to stop reading it was so intense. I had to just take a 2 minute break to absorb the craziness that just went down.<br /><br />Then there were moments where I could not break myself away from the book. I read my books while I am on the train and just did not want to get off at my stop as that would require me to stop reading for at least 30 seconds.<br /><br />Have a great read.
B009GX7O56|5.0|I love NCIS and am so glad that this season isn't letting me down.  Usually a lot of shows start to stretch too far when they continue on for this long, but NCIS is still going strong.
0767817478|3.0|Finally!  A godzilla movie with a realistic monster.  A movie that the whole family can enjoy, not just small children. The man in the rubber suit in all the other godzilla movies was even more ridiculous than Barney.  Rubber suit godzilla could barely move. .<br /><br />The only problem with this movie is the acting.  it is very very bad.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. If you are patient you do not need to spend any actual money. Just use your daily amount and eventually you will have more coins than you will ever use. I am on a level of OVER 210 and I have over 37,000 coins
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love that the android has its own app now.  I'm constantly on Pinterest whether on my phone or kindle fire. I love that its easy to use &amp; its always within reach. keep all the cool ideas coming!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is different then other books in some ways but is a great book. I cant wait to read the next book
B005GG0MIS|5.0|One gets an inside view into how unique the president's job really is. Now we understand why they all age so much during their tenure in office. It was heartening to discover that each president realizes how important it is to assist subsequent holders of the presidency. They all know that the office is far more important  than any one man/woman or party.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|i absolutely LOVE this app. its much easier to do than angry birds and it shows the pig's point of view
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett is an amazing writer - detailing the experience of WWII from a personal level to completely enhance the step by step happenings. Can't wait for the final book in the series.
B008XG1X18|3.0|the site locks up often and I wish there was a pin button to put things on your board without going back to pinterest like on a desktop.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|This trilogy was recommended to me but I found that I couldn't even get through the first book.  The chapters are broken up by characters (which have unusual and difficult to pronounce names). It was an effort to follow on an e-pad because I wanted to flip back to previous chapters to remember who plays what part in the story.  It's not clear about who are the good/bad guys, which can be fun, but not when the characters are numerous and confusing. About halfway through I gave it up.  Probably would have been a decent read in paperback form.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is great if you like hidden object. It has so many different types nighttime, scrambled and shadows to name a few. I enjoy playing this game with the kids and to relax.
B003O86FMW|5.0|great book love it. hope the movie is just as great.<br />I would totally recommend this book to my friends.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love the game cool on wii but better on handheld also good graphics cool to if your thinking get it
B0054SMID0|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie.  It kept your attention and had some good twists in the last half.  Excellent value on Instant Prime
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book based on others reviews but wasn't really expecting much, figured just another coming of age book. It was one of those books that I couldn't wait to get back to every time I put it down.  It was well written and flowed easily.<br /><br />Even after finishing the book, the characters remain with you
B009KHBDUU|1.0|I'm a huge Jonny Depp and Tim Burton fan, but this movie stank! I'm always sorry when this much trouble has gone into making a movie and yet there is no discernable script and plot.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie for families with kids over 10!  The story is better understood if you read the book but its one of the movies that comes close to it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just started to read again thanks to the Kindle Fire . Book was suggested by daughter before viewing movie. Cannot wait to see movie and hope the entire trilogy will be placed on the big screen . Thank you Suzanne !!!<br /><br />Just saw the movie and it was somewhat of a let down . Suzanne did such a great job with the book's and the movie too me was a Cliff notes version .
B00338QENI|5.0|A ethical dilemna of unknown proportions!  Research is critical to identification of treatment modalities as well as identification of the true cause of our diseases.  In the United States, however, we are in control of our bodies and should not be used without our full knowledge and consent. Should we reap financial reward?  Should we do whatever we can to help our fellow humans?  The author did an excellent job of presenting all of these questions, showed compassion as she researched and developed her own understanding of the family and the drive to use HeLa for the benefit of the human race.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I totally and thoroughly enjoyed this book - a great read! The experiences the vet had while serving his country, the heartache of being separated from his wife, and how he used those experiences to remind him of the people and animals he had helped.  Wonderful book!

B009KHDT0C|3.0|I was surprised that I didn't find this movie more interesting.  The actors are all good especially Michelle.  I think they good have had a bit more 'give and take' comedy betweeen the present and the past(Johnny Depp). Of course, I wish there was more Michelle Pfeiffer and Helena Bonham Carter.  So, it was okay.

B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Good action film without any storyline. It's a film most young people (under 25 and male) will find entertaining.  If you've got a spare 2 hrs to kill, it's okay.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It's a great concept, 10 years after the zombie apocalypse a reporter interviews key survivors to piece together the history.<br /><br />Max Brooks (son of Mel Brooks) does not dwell on the hows and whys of zombies, focusing mostly the story of society collapsing in the face of hordes of walking dead.<br /><br />Each survivor's story is just a few pages, and then we go on to the next which keeps the book flowing along at a good speed.  We meet a character, hear their story and then Brooks leaves us wanting more.<br /><br />In most stories the real horror is not the zombies but the panicked, short-sighted and violent reactions to them.  A lot of the stories would have made just as much sense, and been just as horrifying, if the bad guys were rioters or revolutionaries.<br /><br />The story spans the globe, even my sometime homes of Guyana and Trinidad get mentions.<br /><br />Of course when a story is that broad sloppy research occasionally creeps in.  Early on I was scratching my head wondering why a town in mainland China was still using pre-revolution Wade-Giles spellings or why Chinese farmers were riding expensive Harley-Davidsons rather than Chinese-made motorbikes.  Later Brooks creates a Japanese nickname for the zombies which is unpronounceable in Japanese.  A submarine, where crews usually sleep in shifts because there is no space for enough bunks, somehow becomes home to hundreds of refugees and even farms...<br /><br />I'm sure there are other errors but the book's quality far outweighed any of these trivial irritants.<br /><br />It's a genuinely good read, funny, sad and scary in turns.

B007HU7NBK|5.0|I've been a Duranie since 1983 ... I even rushed out to buy Liberty when it came out (one of the very few who did)! I've been through the band's ups and downs over the decades. I've read a lot about the band over the years, including Andy Taylor's bio, but learned a lot through John's book. I felt like I was able to really understand what it was like during the crazy 80s and the impact on his life personally. This book covers it all, from his days as a young boy through the Coachella Festival in 2011.<br /><br />What I like best about the book is that it focuses on his life perspective and leaves out gossipy, negative talk about bandmates. When he talks about times when they weren't speaking or fought, he simply mentions things in vague terms but doesn't disclose any private matters. A classy move during a time when everyone seems compelled to spill the beans on others' secrets.
B001NY4X4G|5.0|I have seen this film several times mostly because of Edward Norton's outstanding performance. He is one of the great actors of our time.  Although Gere and Linney are also excellent to watch, Norton embodies his character to make it believeable in all respects.  He generally does.  This and American History X are must see movies simply because of what he does with his characters.  Great twist at the end.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a great game but as with most games I dislike having to purchase &quot;diamonds&quot; with real money. you are presented with some as you move to the next experience level- but its never really enough to do anything with. but besides that it is a fun game.

B000002549|5.0|As far as I know, this is the only LP/CD Barbra Streisand made singing classical songs rather than her usual popular repertoire. The playing time is a bit short as there are only 10 tracks - but what tracks! The songs she sings are from the 18th to the 20th century. The earliest are two songs by Handel; there is one of Robert Schumann's best known songs, Mondnacht; the even better known Pavane and Apr&egrave;s un rȇve by Gabriel Faur&eacute;; the Berceuse from Joseph Canteloube's Songs of the Auvergne; Claude Debussy's Beau soir; Hugo Wolf's Verschwiegene Liebe; and In Trutina from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana. The Wolf and Schumann have a piano accompaniment by Claus Ogerman who directs the Columbia Symphony Orchestra on the remaining songs. This delightful selection concludes with a song by Ogerman himself - I loved you. The tracks were recorded in 1973.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000041QX Blue Skies]]

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was absolutely awesome. No down time in the entire thing and action packed. The characters stayed true tks their introductions in their respective movies and Mark Ruffalo was great as Banner/Hulk. I watched this movie again right after I watched it the first time and will watch it many more.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I'm about half way through the book.  Lots of info about Nick and Amy and their journey.  So far no info about why Amy went missing?  Seems like the plot should be devloping by now.  Maybe I'm just missing the point but am struggling to finish the book.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie was ok. Not exactly what I was expecting but it was good to watch once. I doubt if I will watch it again.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|The constant barrage of one liners became tiresome 30 minutes into the film.  The villan (Loki) was pathetic... The plan to have the hulk tear the team apart was silly,  hawk eye and black widow served no value,  and the man out of time sub story with the capt. Was over played.  Not a terrible movie but felt like it was rushed to production

0199601348|4.0|Most of us (including me) have only the haziest idea of what ancient Greece was like.  This book takes an unusual approach, made up as it is of profiles of several of the individual city states.  Many of them are well known, such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and Alexandria, some of them less so.  Because of the restricted length of this series of books, none of the profiles is heavily detailed, but I suspect most people will find that fine.  Recommended as background for those reading the ancient Greek literature.

B00122DF16|5.0|How many bands decide to take their 2nd album and say \\"hey! why don't we completely re-do a portion of our songs from our 1st song?\\" Who cares about conventional? And guess what? Reanimation is just as popular as Hybrid Theory. To take already awesome songs and tweak them in such a way to make them just as awesome as the original is not an easy feat. Quit labeling things people and just listen to the music!
B007ZXQNGA|5.0|Its one of the best books I've read. It doesn't just tell you what you need to do to start an enterprise by avoiding the traditional and often expensive ways, it inspires you to look at yourself, your abilities, personal circumstances, interests, and related skills (that are combined in a way uniquely in you) and gives you ideas that you can base your business on. Besides being thoroughly well researched and rich in content, it is also very well written and easy to read. The author has a real talent in doing all the hard research, tabulating data and present it with none of the technicalities normally associated with a well researched book. While easy to read, the author also makes it a point to show his assertions are backed up by lengthly surveys, and follow-up data gathering. He has obviously done a lot of thinking around his data and it shows. Not to mention the fact that he's an entrepreneur himself. Very highly recommend book. It has inspired me to carry on with laying the groundwork for my business.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|But its because I've been restarting the CD in my car. Anyway, Living Things is like their \\"all the soft stuff we wanted to put in\\" album. Its not bad, but Linkin Park is known for songs like Pts.of.Athrty, Faint, etc. where you can feel the energy of every band member always rocking out. Read it again. THAT'S Linkin Park: always rocking out! Wheres Chairman Hahn in this album? (hes apart of the group too). Its not worth 5 stars, but not 1 star either.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|There is an app for Facebook on Kindle, too bad it's this one. You can pretty much only &quot;look&quot; at things. You can't share or upload which sucks! This app is like the facebook stock: it tanks! Kindle fire hd
B003QSJVV2|5.0|This is potentially the best movie I've ever seen. The acting is great and the special effects unobtrusive. Angelina Jolie should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actress. She brings a fresh breath of life into what could have been the role of a wooden and stereotypical love interest. I also greatly enjoyed the emphasis which the movie placed on family with the relationship between Nic Cage and his brother.<br /><br />Overall, a very good film. I would definitely recommend it.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I have been recommending this book lately, but always with a caveat about gaming and gamers. I'm not at all certain that the book would be enjoyable if you had never been into gaming. That said, if gaming is or was a passion for you, you will geek all over yourself while devouring this fast-paced, short read. The only disappointment I experienced was the smarmy, all-too-happy ending.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very simple concept. The first few dozen levels actually get a little tedious, but it gets its hooks in you enough that you'll keep playing to the more taxing stages.<br /><br />Wish it allowed for 360 screen rotation, and that the splash screen wasn't so long. Also would like the ability to go to the home menu without closing the game.

1415937400|2.0|It's interesting reading The Audacity of Hope six years later, in the run-up to Obama's second presidential race.  In hindsight, what stands out most is how much of the book is pure rhetoric, having little to do with his actual agenda.  For instance, at the time he was outspokenly critical of the federal government's massive deficit spending under the Bush administration---but in his own first term in office, far from working to change that, he has doubled down on it.<br /><br />He specifically criticizes, for instance, Bush's \\"hugely expensive prescription drug benefit\\" which he says \\"has only made the problem worse\\"---and yet, his own healthcare reform package has done the same, only even more so.  (To be fair, the ideas he presents in that regard in this book are actually not as bad as Obamacare ended up being---it was made even worse by being more closely modeled on Romneycare!)  He writes, \\"The market alone can't solve our health-care woes---in part because the market has proven incapable of creating large enough insurance pools to keep costs to individuals affordable,\\" but this has nothing to do with the market and there is no reason why it couldn't, and everything to do with government regulation of the insurance market such as restrictions on purchasing insurance across state lines.  He continues, \\"in part because health care is not like other products or services (when your child gets sick, you don't go shopping for the best bargain).\\"  But this is an equivocation---he switches from shopping for *insurance* to shopping for the actual healthcare, and when you think about it for a second it's obvious that even the latter is not the outlandish idea that he tries to suggest it is and healthcare really is mostly just like other products and services in that regard.<br /><br />While some of Obama's criticisms of the Bush administration were fair (but apparently insincere), others are just nonsense.  He accuses Bush of deregulating and dismantling the New Deal, which is not even close to an honest assessment of what was wrong with Bush's \\"Ownership Society\\".  For instance, the Bush administration actually tried to use the federal government to encourage \\"ownership\\" through regulations and programs subsidizing risky loans (through, e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).  Predictably, this did not work---and equally predictably, Obama attempts to blame the outcome on \\"the failure of the free market\\", which had nothing to do with it seeing as how the market wasn't even close to free (the sectors of the economy that have the biggest problems---banking, wall street, housing, healthcare, etc.---are not coincidentally those that are the *most* regulated and have the most government interference in them, and that was just as true under Bush when Obama wrote this as it is now).<br /><br />But the worst part of the book, to me, was the chapter on \\"Faith\\", in which Obama describes the country's and his own \\"movement toward a deepening religious commitment,\\" which is especially disturbing in light of subsequent revelations about his pastor Reverend Wright (from a sermon of whose Obama took the title of this book).  Many Americans may be reassured when he writes, \\"I felt God's spirit beckoning to me.  I submitted myself to His will...\\"  But to me, this is frighteningly reminiscent of how President Bush \\"routinely remark[ed] on how Christ changed his heart.\\"  I would much prefer politicians to keep their faith to themselves and be guided instead by reason in the public sphere.  Obama does offer some criticism of the conservative assault on the separation of church and state, but he is only too happy to, for example, expand Bush's \\"faith-based initiatives\\" and continue DOMA.<br /><br />In short, this book was clearly written basically as a campaign puff piece, designed to make Obama appear more moderate than he really is, while at the same time still trying to make him out to be a bold reformer---but across the board, what Obama advocates is the expansion of the federal government, increasing its role in every aspect of our lives.  His previous book, [[ASIN:0307383415 Dreams from My Father]], was more honest and better.  The better parts of this book are those that are similarly autobiographical rather than straight political rhetoric, and from those I even get the impression that he's a decent guy personally, a good husband and father, and I might kind of like him if he weren't president.<br /><br />It's also interesting reading this after having read Mitt Romney's book, [[ASIN:B0045JK6EC No Apology]]---and the other thing that stood out most to me is how similar the two actually are (which is perhaps the biggest criticism I can make of Obama, as I think Romney is even worse).  There are large chunks of the books, on topics from healthcare and education to regulation, that are virtually indistinguishable.<br /><br />There's only one candidate in this race who offers a real, honest alternative, and that is Gary Johnson.  I recommend reading all three of their books, including Johnson's [[ASIN:1563439131 Seven Principles of Good Government]], and see for yourself.he expansion of the federal government, increasing its role in every aspect of our lives.

B0002VFXFE|3.0|Pros:<br />Significantly better than any stock compound<br /><br />Cons:<br />Significantly inferior to some other 3rd party compounds<br /><br />Overall:<br />I'm getting back into the overclocking game after about a decade gone. I remembered Arctic Silver being the ne plus ultra of thermal compounds, so of course, I went back to it.<br /><br />It's as good as I remember. Multiple degrees were lopped off of my AMD Phenom. But I also experimented with other compounds after reading some comparisons such as the one at Skineelabs.<br /><br />Using a Spire Thermax heat sink, I saw two-to-three degrees Celsius difference between Proliamtech's PK-1 and the Arctic Silver. For nothing more than the paste selection, that is pretty significant to me.<br /><br />If you are not overclocking, this paste will work fine. Otherwise, I would go with another brand.

I think The Casual Vacancy has raised similar issues and people need to stop turning away from them.
0060873175|3.0|Micro is one of the 2 books (other is Pirate Latitudes) published after MC's death. Micro was partially written by Crichton & completed by Richard Preston. Suffice to say that it somewhat disappoints readers who are familiar with MC's techno-thriller style. I will try to minimize spoilers in this review.<br />THE GOOD:<br />+ The shrinking concept (although the actual concept described reminds me of the multiverse transportation process in Crichton's Timeline).<br />THE BAD:<br />- Character development is rather poor and characters are barely fleshed out compared to other MC novels.<br />- The concept and details surrounding the actual shrinking process are barely described, which is unusual for a Crichton novel. Usually the technical details are given more attention than in this novel.<br />- Much of the novel turns out as you expect, and there were a couple times where I could accurately predict what happens next. (However there was a character death that I didn't expect at a certain point in the book).<br />OVERALL, if you don't take it too seriously it's an OK read. I didn't really consider this a \\"Crichton\\" book and judge it as such (I think it would have been unfair to do so). MC was one of my favorite authors and I'm sad that there will be no more of his books in the future. I would recommend other MC novels such as Prey, The Andromeda Strain, Sphere, Disclosure & Timeline over this book.<br />I hope you have found this useful!
B0000AM6IY|1.0|The dvd came quickly after it was ordered, but upon playing it, it began to skip every 45 seconds or so...This continued until about the last 15 minutes of the film.  It made a 2 and a half hour film last for about 3 and a half hours...a waste of time.

Slows up a little in places and the end invites a sequel, which is slightly disappointing.<br /><br />Easy reading for Aussies but could prove harder for others not familiar with the vernacular.
B00932A2MC|1.0|Big budget and special effects cannot save what is essentially a poor story.<br />Liam Neeson was completely wasted in this film, and not used as an actor of his caliber should be.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Despite knowing much of the plot of the story beforehand, it was better than I expected. Lovely prose and keen social commentary. A masterpiece.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A lovely, well written book about the origins of time.  Time Keeper was a very fast read that reminded me of The Alchemist. It will make the reader really think about time and what exactly we wish for when we wish for: more of it, less of it, it to go by more slowly and it to go by more quickly.  Excellent and highly recommended!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|So, how good is the new Mumford & Sons album? I had worried there would be no way to improve on the first album. I was wrong. This album is great. Mumford has a way of creating melodies you cannot get out of hour head. I heard \\"I Will Wait\\" on the radio a couple months ago and it has been a constant go-to when I notice myself subconsciously singing or humming. It is amazing what a banjo can add to an already great song.<br /><br />I have noticed a lot of people want to classify Mumford as a country band. I would have to disagree with that. While many country bands do feature a banjo, Mumford does something new and innovative with the instrument. Some of the songs have haunting melodies that make you sit up and pay attention and others will have you stomping your feet. I really enjoy all the tracks on this album but a few of the most notable are \\"I Will Wait\\", \\"Babel\\", \\"Broken Crown\\", and \\"Not With Haste\\".<br /><br />You can't say this after a single brilliant album, but now, after a second ridiculously good album, I can say I love Mumford & Sons--and so should you.

B007FH9GA6|5.0|When I heard David Fincher was set to direct this movie adaptation of the world-famous book, I instantly had very high expectations. He met and exceeded those expectations. I have see this movie three times now and I cannot find anything negative to say about it at all. There are some minor deviations from the source material but these changes only serve to enhance the story. I don't want to dive much into plot so as not to spoil this gem for the 10 people left in the world who have neither read the book nor seen the movie. I'll just say watch the film. It is great!<br /><br />By the way, this movie is a very hard \\"R\\". I wouldn't recommend this for kids.

1616960922|5.0|having read most of Brandon's books, i have come to expect a great deal from him. I expect stories with absolutely intriguing characters, amazing plot, fulfilling endings, and a type of magic that always leaves you so amazed, you get angry at the real world for it's dull physics and boring laws of nature.<br /><br />This book did not dissapoint. It was great, one of the best pieces of fantasy literature that I have read. out of the list of aspects I expect from Brandon sanderson, I was blown away by the magic in this novel, and the ending he wrote. Both were phenominal, and a key indicator that brandon is one of the best authors of his time.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  It was interesting enough to keep me reading to the end. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys something different.  It's like nothing I've ever read before.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I thought this was a great thought provoking book. No scary stuff like King is known for. I kept wanting to skip ahead to see what happens but you really can't.<br />It poses the question 'if you could go back and change something, even something small in your own life, would you? Should you?' We can't know all the ripples our actions cause. Even if we are correcting what we think is a mistake or trying to erase regret, we cannot predict what that will cause.<br />Jake thought he was doing something good and beneficial but I don't think he really even considered that he might not understand the consequences and how far reaching they would be. He is single mindedly determined to carry out what his friend assigned him, to hell with the consequences.<br />At times I became impatient with Jake/George's tunnel vision and seeming oblivion to the ramifications of his actions but could understand his desire to change the past for the better. Who wouldn't kill Hitler if they could? On the other hand, who's to say that something even worse than Hitler (is there such a thing?) wouldn't have happened?<br />I recommend this book to sci-fi/fantasy/Stephen King fans and those with lots of time- its long!
B000NY12LO|3.0|This book makes you aware of bullying and what we all should be doing to prevent it. Being in high school is hard enough without having to deal with extreme bullying. This book was very slow and the writer gave you little bits at a time, which I find frustrating. It kept jumping to the past and then the future. I give it 3 stars because I finished it pretty fast because I wants to know what happened that day. You don,t find out till the end.
0307960471|1.0|I liked this right up until the end when Harry dies and LETS Oleg kill him.  How stupid is that? I was just getting to know Harry Hole and he kills him off. Spoilers?  Too bad. I wasn't pleased with what I shelled out only to find this will not be a source of future reading pleasure because the character is dead.
B00378VGGO|5.0|At least 20 words ahahaha. What it is this highschool? Anyway. So FMF came out on my birthday, which I'm always excited to see something creatively animated that comes out on my birthday. And then it's also a Wes Anderson film, and I am a huge fan. So going in I had very high expectations about the movie. Amazingly all of them were met and it has earned its place among my all time top ten favorite movies.<br /><br />Though I must say, before this movie I had never read any Roald Dahl books before hand, I had only ever seen movies based on his books (James & The Giant Peach, Matilda), but after watching this I wanted to read the book. Fair warning, there are significant differences between the movie and book, namely the amount of agency given to female characters in the movie as opposed to the book and also the rounding out of characters in the movie as opposed to the book. And in all fairness the book it targeted towards children and children don't need a lot of back story as long as the main story flows and carries interest, which it does.<br /><br />I believe that this movie is geared towards people who read this book in their childhood and now would appreciate a more fleshed out version of the story, seeing as Wes Anderson himself said that FMF was the first Roald Dahl book he read as a child.<br /><br />And if you haven't read the book but are a fan of Wes Anderson, like myself, this is still wonderful Wes Anderson storytelling, complemented by a fantastic cast and a beautifully thought out soundtrack. The puppets used for the animation are beautifully made, and I cannot wait for a chance to get my own physical copy of this movie.<br /><br />FYI: since this is a digital copy, I totally recommend just making sure you download this to your kindle and turn the internet off when you plan to watch it, because omg, amazon player LOVES to make you use the cloud copy and not the one on your device if the internet is on. keeping the internet off takes away a bit of wait when watching it.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope you enjoy/ed this movie just as much as I do.when watching it.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope you enjoy/ed this movie just as much as I do.

B004LWZW8I|3.0|While King Hyperion's (Mickey Rourke) army rampages through Greece in search of the Epirus Bow, so he can unleash the imprisoned Titans and bring war to the heavens, Theseus (Henry Cavill), once a lowly peasant and social outcast, is now the only hope mankind, and the Gods, have to stop Hyperion plans.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to watch with a lot of action, but not have to think too hard about story or characters, then `Immortals' checks all the right boxes; it's here to wow you with beautiful visuals, hot bodies and brutally visceral action, but becomes as clichéd as it gets when slowing down for `character' moments. The details that went into designing the looks, costumes and sets are impressive, but the acting feels serviceable and dialogue a little wooden. I mean that speech Theseus gave, that was suppose to rouse the troops, felt flat in delivery and was nowhere near as inciting as King Leonidas's `We are Spartans' bellow in `300'. `Immortals' is still pretty good for a night-in of mindless violence, but I say watch it first before you decide to commit to having it on your shelf.<br /><br />Special features include `It's No Myth', a short doco with mythology experts talking about the evolution of Greek mythology. Deleted scenes, one or two of which I felt could've given the film a bit more depth, and the Theatrical trailer.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|Fans of Johnny Depp movies probably will enjoy this, especially as he seems to relish the role.  While the movie is indeed \\"quirky\\", it does do a creditable job of setting the Dark Shadows tone overall.  Scenery and acting are solid, but the characters really do not seem to have consistent motivation and are not well explored or well used.  Storyline wanders between the expected family revival / vengeance plots and the side trips to subordinate plotlines are short, vaguely unsatisfying, and well, \\"trippy\\" is really appropriate.  It's possible this is a result of story compression; Depp tries to do so much with this movie, it's hard for it to stay consistent, and there's a feeling that really he wanted to do a miniseries from the material here.  The ending seems both overdone and underdone at the same time.  At any rate, as a whole it's entertaining but don't expect to glean much meaning from the story or gain empathy for the characters - likely you won't.  We enjoyed it but not as much as his better films.

0439023521|5.0|I was surprised at how much I loved this book. The movie is okay, but the book is amazing. Much of the popular teen fiction is poorly written and contrived, but this piece absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />A great read.
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|This has got to be one of the dumbest games I've ever played.  Conceptually the company tried to create a board game where it just doesn't work.  Not only are there not enough pieces to make the pictures, but to think you can form Lego pieces into 2d art is just ridiculous.  It last us a whole 5 minutes.  It seems that for every object you try to create either the type of piece you need is not there or there just aren't enough.  For example, one clue was a barn, but there just are not enough red Lego pieces to make a barn and if you utilize other colors no one would guess what it is.  It seems like this game was just put together to make money off the Lego brand name.  Stay away.  I promise you, it's awful.
0439023513|5.0|I've heard people complain that the ending of the Hunger Games trilogy was overly sad, that the book was too different from the others, or that the plot wasn't even about the \\"hunger games\\".  I would argue, though, that this book was the perfect conclusion to the story.<br /><br />In my opinion, this story didn't need to be about a third \\"Hunger Game\\" - the characters had moved past the contrived game that and were playing a much bigger - and more weighty - game now.  And while this ending was no fairy tale ending, I don't believe that's what the series ever set out to be. I would say, too, that the ending was completely satisfying and - without giving anything away - was not completely without hope.<br /><br />This book examines movingly the nature of human beings, what evil - and good - we are capable of, and the idea that there is always a considerable cost in any fight for freedom. There are a number of lines that have stayed with me long after I returned the book to my bookshelf, and I intend to reread the series again soon.<br /><br />Powerfully written, with meaningful content and \\"big picture\\" questions. Highly recommend this series - and I loved this book.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I can't imagine too many people not being familiar with this movie, speaking mainly for baby boomers and before, but my children, born in the 70's and 80's, also enjoy this type of film.  This was the first time I've seen this movie in its HD format and was very pleased.  No, it won't compare in quality to the films made by today's standards, but it was much cleaner and more clear than I ever remember.  I've always enjoyed this movie and wish Hollywood would still make these great musicals.  A movie the whole family can watch together.
B006ZDU7QI|3.0|So of course I was intrigued after his single \\"Someone That I Used to Know\\".  I have Kimbra's \\"Vows\\" and had high hopes.  I will say I was a little disappointed with the rest of the album. It's not bad in any way, but it just doesn't feel as cohesive with the above single as well as \\"Eyes Wide Open\\".  It's snooze-y and boring, and I'm not a fan of the two short intro pieces.  I don't own Gotye's prior album(s), so I'm not able to compare, as others are. This is just my opinion. I bought those two singles and I think I'll leave it at that.  Sometimes, though, I notice that albums grow on me the more I listen, so if I change my mind, I'll update.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I think this is the first book that I have read to completion only to say, \\"Why did I do that?\\"<br /><br />There is such an incredible lack of continuity in this book, and frankly, it became a great deal of work to keep up. There is a great deal of attention to descriptive detail, but poor flow. Examples: why doesn't Diana have a cell phone? She is constantly borrowing everyone else's. A 30-something modern day smart woman who is obviously tech savvy enough to need her computer, but she is without a cell phone? No mention of why she doesn't have one - so I had to assume it was a personal quirk. Then we get through 85% of the book, and Matthew says, \\"Here, borrow this cell phone because yours doesn't hold a charge.\\" You mean, she actually has one? Just seems like this came out of the blue.<br /><br />Another example - vampires don't sleep. Everyone knows this, and Diana even corrects someone later in the book by saying, \\"vampires don't sleep.\\" But halfway through, Diana and Matthew are in bed, and she wakes up and he is snoring away......he doesn't wake up when she kisses him and goes out for a walk. Huh?<br /><br />A lot of other things came out of the blue- too numerous for me to reiterate- and left me scratching my head. It just seemed like the editors missed the lack of continuity, and so did the author. With all the detail in this book, the lack of continuity made it difficult to read.  Characters converse about things they should not have known about.......dialogue was confusing, and I frequently found myself wondering who was talking.<br /><br />Why did I stick it out until the end? I hung in there because I am a diehard romantic and wanted to see where this was going. I loved the Oxford setting - this was fascinating. I truly loved the witch/daemon/vampire/human world, which was delightful and creative. But I was so irritated by the inconsistency and excessive, unnecessary detail, that for the first time in my kindle-reading life, I almost quit at 92% in........it was so frustrating and so laborious.<br /><br />Ironically- I also LOVE time travel, so I picked up the sequel!  But it was worse...... and I didn't get past 20% before I returned it.<br /><br />Honestly, this had SO much potential, but it was a struggle. If you appreciate good writing, you may want to look elsewhere.

034580404X|1.0|If the author's pathetic attempt at fan fiction hasn't made it abundantly clear that she's completely talentless, then the fact that she has to buy FAKE reviews from unscrupulous marketing companies surely leaves no doubt.<br /><br />Amazon needs to be more proactive in fighting this practice, as it significantly undermines the review system.  And shame on whatever-her-name-is - I hope the money she's made from these \\"books\\" is enough to make up for the fact that she'll never be respected as a writer.<br /><br />. . . oh look, my review is surrounded by a fresh batch of \\"gushing\\" reviews, all about the same length with the same general content.  Oh and look at how certain five-star reviews are now at the top of \\"Most Helpful\\" reviews - I guess people are being paid to rate reviews, too.<br /><br />Tsk, tsk, tsk.
B008CFN95I|5.0|I found it hard to put this book down and read it in a very short time. I found it totally intriguing, being a tale of seeming magic and mystery, combined with a very modern and futuristic use of electronic devices. It was a meeting of the old and the new in a very successful intertwining. At the beginning, I was slightly annoyed at the grammar and punctuation, but as I become immersed in the story, my pedantry fell away. I felt that Mr. Penumbra would have been at home in the annals of Harry Potter - he was just that type of character. Needless to say, I just loved this book, and it led me to read another written by the same author that I was able to get my hands on. I hope Robin Sloan writes lots of books. If they are as entertaining as this one, he should be very successful, and I for one will be only too happy to purchase them.
B0011ZWKDS|5.0|I am an avid Sarah Brightman fan.  I listen to classical crossover and celtic almost exclusively.  A friend of mine played Nightwish for me so I could hear their soprano.

B009B51K9U|2.0|Way too pop-oriented for my tastes.<br /><br />The good news: it's not complete crap, and my 12-year old son finally has some Green Day he can somewhat relate to. The bad news? I can't relate to much at all on this album. I understand that artists grow, change as their own lives change as well as those of the people and places around them. It just feels like a money grab, way too rote and formulaic.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I'll get the visceral reaction out of the way quickly. I was disappointed with the movie the first time I watched it, from a director who gave us the original \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" plus gripping non-sci fi films such as \\"Black Rain\\" and \\"Gladiator\\". The best thing I can say for Director Scott is that I believe the primary problem is not with the premise, which had enormous potential, but in the plot and the line by line writing. But, I watched it a second time the next night, and some of the kinks were ironed out by noticing some lines. Also, the relevance of the Prometheus myth became far clearer, and through it, I realized an important back story explanation which was obscured by the characters' ignorance. Read the Prometheus story before watching the movie and pay very close attention to the opening (and think 2001 opening.)<br /><br />One indicator of how incomplete things seem is that the very old billionaire, Peter Weyland, is played by a fine middle aged actor, Guy Pearce, but we never see him younger in flashbacks, which were probably cut from the final editing. Without giving too much away, the Peter Weyland character adds very little to the story aside from being the person who funds the mission.<br /><br />I sensed something was seriously out of joint when the \\"away team\\" enters the cavernous artifact. After encountering something just a bit squeamish, the geologist Fifield (Sean Harris) and biologist Milburn (Rafe Spall) decide to return to the Prometheus (the name of the humans' interstellar space ship.) The remaining team does a fair amount of exploring. Among other things, they see a hologram of the intelligent giants, drawings of whom they found on Earth. they are seeking running from some unseen danger. I saw no clue to what triggered the hologram. Following the hologram, they find the decapitated head of one of the giants (as opposed to the 'aliens' we encountered in earlier films).<br /><br />The captain of the Prometheus sends them a message that a serious storm is approaching. The team, with the usual annoyingly distracting side efforts which slow them down, reach the entrance and begin driving their vehicles back to the ship. But, and here the train falls off the track, never to return, we find Fifield and Milburn still in the artifact, when they said they were returning to the ship. They found some kind of life which intrigued the biologist. But why didn't the team returning to the ship notice that none of their vehicles were gone. Why did they leave the other two behind? Somehow, the two truants don't get the warning about the storm, or ignore it, so they become stuck in the artifact.<br /><br />There are loose ends aplenty with the alien fauna on this desolate world. My expectation coming in was that the film would explore the origins of two creatures, the \\"Alien\\" and the race of the giant pilot discovered by the crew of the mining ship Nostromo in \\"Alien\\". We meet the giants soon enough, but we also encounter at least three other life forms which have a passing resemblance to THE Alien, but their connection to the life cycle of the Alien is never explained.<br /><br />I'm entering dangerous \\"spoiler\\" territory now, so I will not discuss any more of the plot except to say that there are a number of unexplained events. Mysteries are great in the middle of the film, but one expects most of these to be wrapped up and revealed at the end of the picture. Many are not, leaving a huge jumping off point for a sequel to \\"Prometheus\\".<br /><br />Part of the special attraction of this story is that the audience knows full well what will eventually happen, so there is a lot of mental \\"don't go there\\" and \\"don't do that\\" moments, because we already know what things that look like that can do. The problem with that is that there is too much \\"quoting\\" from \\"Alien\\" for my tastes. Most of it is done relatively well, but it becomes more and more obvious as time goes on, and increasingly annoying. There is also ample quoting from other major Sci Fi movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (both in situations and in dialogue). There are also some subtle cinematic (visual) quotes from \\"Avatar\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\".<br /><br />One of the bright spots, aside from the imaginative, well done CGI and cinematography, is the acting, which I always thought was a weak spot in \\"Alien\\". The crewmen, such as Captain Idris Elba, are spot on (unlike Yahpet Kotto in \\"Alien\\"). Instead of the strong Ellen Ripley character, we have the physically smaller and less imposing archaeologist, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) who sports a convincing English accent as the lead character. Charlize Theron's character is restrained and unlikable. Like both Scott and Cameron's \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\", this movie has an android (artificial person) as a principal character, in a role much fuller than in the earlier movies. The only thing which distinguishes 'David', Michael Fassbender's android from Scott's earlier android Ash (Ian Holm, Alien) and Cameron's Bishop (Lance Hendrickson, Aliens)is that David is ever so slightly stilted, somewhat like Data from \\"Startrek, The Next Generation.\\"<br /><br />I will give this the benefit of the doubt for now, but I found a strong disjoint in the rationale between two early scenes and the climax. I sense Scott wanted to leave plenty of meat on the bone to support a sequel. (In contrast, Avatar is almost totally devoid of preparation for a sequel I suspect I will need to revisit this review after seeing the film again. If my suspicion about gaps and disconnects is born out, I may have to lower my rating to 3 stars.e quoting from other major Sci Fi movies such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (both in situations and in dialogue).

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book about the reality of life. Excellent writing and very interesting. You laugh, cry and smile at the same time.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|So wonderful to watch these shows.  Kazillions of guest stars bring memories flooding back, tonight was Martin Sheen, Vera Miles, Vincent Price and soooo many more.  These stories are terrific and I don't have to listen to profanity or worry about sexual content.  Gee  don't ya wonder how they made shows without all that garbage?  Anyway, the DVD's so far (into series 3) have been crisp, clear voices and no problems as of yet, and I don't expect any.  I usually spend a lot of time with British Mysteries (i.e. Midsomer Murder, Inspector Frost, Sherlock Holmes, etc.) and this is now a wonderful addition to our collections.  The stories are endearing and Peter Falks' performances bring a smile especially when he says \\"Just one more thing\\".  Gladly recommend ... enjoy.

B0069JBKHI|2.0|Was really excited when I got it as a gift, particularly as it is so much simpler to set up than most other video ip  systems. But A) the quality of the link is very unstable. It frequently cut out, meaning too often I only learned my baby was unsettled because I could hear her shrieking through the door. And worse B) the quality of the construction is shoddy. Four month after I received it, it stopped working. Good luck trying to get the attention on the company.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book was dark and full of sex drugs and violance.  There seemed to be no point.  I kept forcing myself to read this book hoping against hope that something would happen or I would feel some enlightment.  But in the end it just quit.  I would not recommend this to anyone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this!  I go in several times a day as my coins reup!  super addictive! I just wont buy coins and would rather wait for them to regenerate.

B007THA4FI|1.0|Rowling went from genius to garbage. I wish I had read a critique about this book before I wasted my money. Very seldom do I purchase a book and not try to read the whole thing. It was going from bad to worse and then I read a review and realized this was not for me. I hope she does better with her next book but I will never purchase another one of hers without some idea about what it contains. A real stinker. I hate to give it even one star.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I usually am a bit skeptical when it comes to independently published books, so I was very pleasantly surprised by Wool. Despite being a voracious reader, I've only written one other review. However, I felt compelled to chime in with the other readers who have given this series five stars. I literally could not put this book down. I have gone without sleep and lunch and have barely talked to my family because I was so absorbed in this book. Howey really made me care about these characters and had me ripping through the pages to find out what happened to them. I can't wait to read another book by this author! Well done!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Yet another great read. I so enjoy these books that carry on with the same family. I can't wait for no 3.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|This is a great family movie and my son and I really enjoyed watching it. We will probably be watching this again. It's so cute!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Ive been playing for a while and its really really fun!!! But then it starting crashing... pleeeeeeeeaaaassseeeee fix it :( But overall this game is fun :)
B008RYN44U|1.0|Sorry, but I didn't want a third solo album by Gwen Stefani. This album was years in the making, and turning out only 11 songs is pitiful. Were the others done that terrible? It won't be shocking if this is the swan song for the group. They're all older. They've all found other careers in the decade they were away. Gwen is more successful on her own. If this is what they would continue to churn out in the future, I'd rather they call it a day.<br /><br />What the public wanted was the No Doubt sound, and that was a return to \\"Tragic Kingdom.\\" Now, some are going to scream that you shouldn't do the same thing twice (even though they redid a bit of the Caribbean sound on this release), but with this album it was necessary. Bands have a sound, and they needed to split themselves apart from Gwen Stefani's 80s new-wave pop vibe, and reintroduce the public to who and what they were all about. This album is like the poor man's Gwen Stefani. It's not even up to her standards.<br /><br />Well, we have four previous No Doubt releases to go back and listen to, even though \\"Rock Steady\\" was where it all began to go downhill. It become \\"The Gwen Stefani Solo Show,\\" and acted as the precursor to \\"her\\" sound.<br /><br />Thanks for the memories No Doubt! You will continue to be missed.

B0007TKNII|1.0|I bought this item for my dad for Father's Day. I know that he loves the movie and has it on VHS, but he no longer has a VHS player so I bought this for him. He's a VERY busy man and has just finally been able to watch it. He tells me it goes great, but then he got to one part and it just started skipping horribly. He had just taken it out of the plastic wrapping it had been it too. First time watching it and it's faulty. Since it has been so long since it was purchased I'm not sure I can even get a replacement. Keeping my fingers crossed though!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Totally worth it!! If you read the first one you gotta read this one!! Can't wait til the third comes out!!

B005S9ELM6|4.0|ARGO is a well-paced and well-acted movie that takes us back to a seminal moment in modern U.S. history, the 1979-1980 Iranian hostage crisis that ushered in the Reagan era. The film focuses on a little-known footnote, the so-called \\"Canadian Caper,\\" in which six American diplomats bluffed their way out of Iran by posing as a Hollywood production crew scouting a location for a sci-fi film.<br /><br />The film stars Tony Mendez, a CIA artist and technician (played by director Ben Affleck) who thought up the ruse. He enlists Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman), who won an Oscar for Planet of the Apes and also designed Spock's ears in Star Trek and had helped Mendez upgrade CIA disguises. Aided by a Hollywood producer (Alan Arkin), they mount an elaborate back story, complete with a script, storyboards, posters, and ads in Variety magazine for the bogus movie (Roger Zelazny's [[ASIN:0060567236 Lord of Light]]).<br /><br />Although the larger landscape of the Iranian revolution is accurately presented, history buffs may be disappointed that the details of the operation itself are distorted almost beyond recognition. Affleck's character looms larger than life, while the American diplomats and their Canadian hosts are poorly developed cardboard foils for his heroics. This slant is not so surprising, given that the film is based on Mendez's 2002 memoir, [[ASIN:0060957913 The Master of Disguise: My Secret Life in the CIA]].<br /><br />But it has earned the film the ire of Canadians, who say it trivializes their pivotal role in the rescue. Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), who harbored the fugitives and was instrumental in their rescue, is portrayed as a passive innkeeper taking orders from the CIA. In media interviews, he has called the film \\"total fiction\\" and \\"absolute nonsense.\\"<br /><br />Affleck has responded to this criticism by noting that, like many Hollywood productions, the movie purports to to be \\"BASED on a true story,\\" rather than BEING a true story. \\"We're allowed to take some dramatic license,\\" he reportedly said. \\"There's a spirit of truth.\\"<br /><br />The distortions do not end there. A second CIA agent who accompanied Mendez into Iran is absent altogether, as are all mention of a series of potentially fatal blunders by Mendez and the CIA. For example, the CIA map showed the incorrect location for the Canadian Embassy where the agents were supposed to meet their contacts. And on the morning of the escape, Mendez actually overslept, according to accounts of the rescue released after the CIA declassified it in 1997.<br /><br />The actual exit was also far less dramatic than portrayed in Argo. As described by Mendez in a lengthy narrative on the CIA's official website, the departure went as \\"smooth as silk\\"; \\"The Iranian official at the checkpoint could not have cared less\\" about the group's paperwork as he stamped the fake passports and exit visas that allowed them to escape onto a waiting Swissair flight (that was delayed due to a minor mechanical problem, not depicted in the film).<br /><br />Still, While Mendez is overly glamorized in Argo, the CIA is not. The agency is portrayed as willing to sacrifice the diplomats in order to avoid potential international embarrassment.<br /><br />Shane Bauer, one of three American hikers taken hostage by Iran in 2009, tweeted another flaw, regarding its depiction of the Iranian people: Every Iranian except the maid and the Shah loyalists in the embassy lobby are depicted as \\"thugs or part of an angry mob.\\"<br /><br />Yet despite - or perhaps because of - all of its distortions, omissions and biases, Argo still works. It is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is both entertaining and historically relevant. I recommend it.BEING a true story. \\"We're allowed to take some dramatic license,\\" he reportedly said. \\"There's a spirit of truth.\\"<br /><br />The distortions do not end there.

B000IHL51S|5.0|I went to see Rambo 2 aka Rambo Missions movie back in 1985 when it first came to the theaters.  I went to see it while on Leave from the military with my Dad.  It was a fantastic movie for its time, and it made me feel damn proud that I was in the military and serving my country, just as my Dad did during and after the Korean War and the Vietnam War!! Sadly my Dad passed away in 2010 on January 1.  In his loving memory and also in remembering seeing Rambo 2 together, which is the very first time that I understood my Dad and what he went through in Vietnam and Korea, and bonding so closely with him at that time, I had a Rambo style survival knife made by hand to honor him by.  Now, whenever I grab my beautiful knife to use it, even though it is not an exact Rambo 2 knife replica, I can still hold it and remember my Dad and that wonderful time we spent together watching Rambo 2.  Thanks for reading!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book started out kind of slow but then really picked up. Then I was really glad I stayed with it but only to be disappointed with the ending.
0525423281|4.0|For a girl with only three wishes in life, she sure chose two near-impossible ones. Lola Nolan is a high school junior who can't wait to make costume design her career path. Making a historically accurate Marie Antoinette costume to wear to her Winter Formal is is the easy wish. Making her dads like (and trust) her 22-year-old rock star boyfriend? Not so much. Then her third wish gets eviscerated when the Bell twins move back in next door.<br /><br />They used to be friends, of course; but one day, Calliope ended their association. And, though Cricket was so likeable and amiable, he always did as his sister said. Calliope is a professional skater, so the family has always followed her dream of making the Olympics. They moved in and out over the years, trying out different coaches. But now they're back in San Francisco. Lola has a boyfriend who loves her and is an awesome rock god, so why should she care about what happened before Cricket left the last time? She has convinced herself that he never was interested her when he broke her heart, but it sure seems like he is going out of his way to see her, even though he is now in college in Berkeley.<br /><br />On top of everything, Lola's birth mother is in trouble again. They can't ignore her, since she's the sister of one of her dads. Looks like she is going to have to live with them until they can figure out what to do. Then Max's band starts playing more gigs, Cricket hangs out more with Lola with major approval from the dads and Lola starts questioning her relationships. Is she really hiding her real self behind her unconventional clothing and accessory choices?<br /><br />What she does know is she can't continue to hang out with Cricket while Max is out of town with his band. But Max is gone more often, while Cricket..is not. And once a huge misunderstanding is ironed out, souls are laid bare, and Lola can't say she has no feelings toward Cricket, she knows she has to make a decision.<br /><br />First and foremost, I must say, if you haven't read Anna and the French Kiss by the same author, it would be much more fun if you read that one first. Let's just say that there is some most excellent character crossover in Lola, and it will mean more if you know these characters already. Also, if you do decide to read Anna after reading this book, there might be some unintended spoilers.<br /><br />I loved Anna and I love Lola, too. Ms. Perkins has quite the way with tension, romance, unrequited-nosity and quirkiness. Her characters are well developed and don't seem to make any false steps with regard to their actions. Nothing bothers me more than when action happens only to further the story, but is not something that normal people/that character would do. The secondary characters, too, are fully fleshed out and believable.<br /><br />Lola learns that love takes many forms. Sometimes, it's romantic; sometimes, it's trusting; and sometimes, it's caring when you don't feel someone is worthy. And when Cricket tells Lola the story of the moon, and the perfect girl, and the boy who loves her, and the stars he whispers her name to, and he says<br /><br />I know you aren't perfect. But it's a person's imperfections that make them perfect for someone else.<br />you will understand why Lola can't forget about Cricket.<br /><br />4 of 5 Stars (Based on Ink and Page's Rating System)<br /><br />Genres: Young Adult Fiction Contemporary Romance<br />Ages: 14 and up<br />You might want to know: Some sexual references.<br />Related review: Anna and the French Kiss<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door by Stephanie Perkins was published September 29, 2011 by Dutton Juvenile.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Good reading for any age.  The relationships  are wonderfully complex.  Looking forward to the third book and the cast of characters that remain.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|If you liked SONIC BOOM then you will like MONSTER as it sounds like a perfect follow up to the previous album.<br />Very catchy songs all the way through.  Gene and Paul share most of the vocal duties and Tommy and Eric get one lead vocal performance each.  Eric's track called \\"All For the Love of Rock and Roll\\" is probably my favorite on the album but most of the songs here are pretty great and certainly have the classic KISS sound. Real standouts are \\"Freak\\" and \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" but there really isn't any filler on this album other than perhaps the last song.  There are a dozen tracks on this one and the running time is about 45 minutes.  While it isn't as lavish or nicely presented as the SONIC BOOM album, it is a great sounding recording and I suspect most long time KISS fans will be pleased.  If you only want the original line up then this album of course isn't for you (although it sounds very much like the original members) but if you like KISS in all of its various incarnations over the years then you are pretty much certain to love MONSTER.  If I had to compare it to other KISS albums I would say it is certainly in the top half of their 20 studio albums (not counting the solos) and sounds a bit like a mix of CREATURES, REVENGE and SONIC BOOM.  These guys really know what they are doing and they have made another fine album with the traditional KISS formula.  Entirely excellent.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This was a very dead end movie.. it started out alright, but there was too much swearing for our liking, and it was a gross movie. Didn't even finish it after giving it 2 chances.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|We enjoy the Flow free game.  It is simple, but yet makes you think.  I got it for my 6 year old granddaughter and didn't know if she would be able to do it, but she really enjoys the challenge.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great free game there are some optional ways to earn money other than extra purchases highly recommend addicting must download.
B0091QSNEE|4.0|My 3 year old granddaughter likes this game.  It keeps here busy for airplane rides for about 2 hours.  I would recommend this game to others.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds Space brings new ways to cause the Pigs more problems.  The use of gravity to curve the paths of the Birds is very inventive and it can be educational in showing how items can move in space. You now have to think of the different paths that the Birds may take to do what you want. Great Fun!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|We all know Katniss's outcome since eshe is the main character. It is interesting how she gets there but very simple read. Not much thinking involved but plenty of gore.<br /><br />Now reading second book cause it's inexpensive follows the same story. A very fast read also.<br /><br />Both are slightly suspenseful but kind of predictable.<br /><br />Good to read for slow nights.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|Star Trek has had its high points and its low points over the years.  There have been some tremendous storys told, and some...  lackluster?...  ones, and some just terrible ones.<br /><br />Note that I grew up with the original series.  Yes, there have been additional spin-off type series, supposedly set in the same universe, and they can be treated individually, but as far as I'm concerned, \\"Star Trek\\" is the original TV series and the movies based upon that, not \\"The Next Generation\\" or \\"Voyager\\" or \\"Deep Space Nine\\" or \\"Enterprise\\" or the new \\"reboot movie\\" done by JJ Abrams a couple of years ago.  Those are all largely separate enntities, all of which (yes, including the new flick) have different characters, different situations, different storytelling techhniques, and so forth.  This doesn't NECESSARIlY make those other spin-off ideas worse, or better, just different.  You can make your own calls about the quality of each individual spin-off.  In other words, I'm just defining my terms here.<br /><br />That said, we can easily put the severan TNG-era movies into the comparison, as this movie far eclipses those as well.<br /><br />In 1979, \\"Star Trek - The Motion Picture\\" came out.  It was the big-screen continuation of the original Star Trek TV show, supposedly \\"updated.\\"  The quality of the visual effects was spectacular, and the new ship (it's not the same ship, it just happens to have the same name and the same general configuration) was pretty to look at.  The same actors were playing the same roles.<br /><br />But... the FEEL was all wrong.  It lacked the real, HUMAN, interactions which were at the core of the original series' best storytelling.  So we had a ship which felt dreary, depressing, and dehumanizing inside.  We had costuming which might have been comfortable, but was visually dull and drab.  We had dialog which occasionally \\"hinted\\" at the close \\"just like us\\" human interaction which the original series was so successful for using, but mostly, it was actors staring at pretty lights with badly-acted \\"awestruck looks\\" on their faces.<br /><br />SO...  despite being a technical masterpiece (for the most part), this first movie was not considered the sort of blockbuster which would have been required to make additional movies.<br /><br />Fortunately, someone at Paramount realized that it wasn't the fault of the cast, or of the overall concept, but rather of the leadership for the production, which led to the storytelling failures of this film.  And they realized that they had a lot of property, built for that first film, which would be able to be re-used at very little cost for additional films.<br /><br />SO...  they dumped the production team (including Star Trek's creator, Gene Roddenberry, who at this point had lost track of what he'd originally known so well when creating the original series!) and hired an entirely new production team.  A team who had no attachments to Star Trek whatsoever.<br /><br />They hired a well-known TV line-producer, Harve Bennett, as the executive producer (taking over from ROddenberry).  Bennett was someone who understood budgeting, scheduling, and the proper way to \\"hire the right people and then get out of their way,\\" all areas in which Roddenberry had failed, very badly, in while making TMP.  Bennett held sway over the majority of the remaining original-series films, with just a couple of exceptions, and much of the success of the films he led can be laid directly at his feet.<br /><br />They hired a really good director, who understood what the director of \\"The Motion Picture\\" had failed to grasp... science fiction is just set-dressing, and the storytelling must be about PEOPLE, not about \\"fantastic special effects\\" or \\"high-concepts\\" even if you're wrapped up in those things.  All the \\"science fiction\\" trappings of the story are there for is to open up possible HUMAN storytelling which might not be practical in \\"real world\\" situations.  Nicholas Meyer got that, and got itvery, very well.  He, frankly, didn't care at all about the \\"space\\" elements of this, but he clearly understood the CHARACTERS.<br /><br />The budget was reduced, dramatically, from what was available in the first film.  Nevertheless, they had enough budget to create a new ship (the Reliant, a sister ship to the Enterprise) to make new uniforms (which seemed more real, and were much more visually appealing, patterned in large part upon real-world military uniforms).  They re-used quite a bit from the first movie (the two of the new sets... the space station transporter room and the Enterprise torpedo bay...  were both repaints of portions of a set... the Klingon bridge... from the first movie, for example), they raided \\"stock prop\\" warehouses for set-dressing (the same \\"scifi set dressing\\" bits seen in this film were seen in dozens and dozens of other 1970s, 1980s and 1990s TV shows), and so forth.  Heck, they made new \\"communicators\\" from found equipment from the local Home Depot!<br /><br />They did hire Lucas's special effects house, \\"Industrial Light and Magic,\\" to do the visual effects, and they did a fine job,  Again, to save money, they re-used some shots from the first film, so while the model of the Enterprise did get a new paint job or this film, it still has the original paint job in quite a few shots.<br /><br />My point is simple...  they were FRUGAL in this film.  Instead of planning out science-fictiony spectacle, as the first movie did, they focused almost entirely on the human storytelling.  The other stuff was, as it should be, all \\"set dressing\\" to help the audience forget that they're watching actors on a soundstage.  And it worked...  magnificently.  (A lesson which J.J. Abrams seems to have failed on, in my judgement, in his reboot movie.)<br /><br />The storytelling in this film is what makes it rise head and shoulders above any other Star Trek film, and over most non-Star Trek films for that matter.  We get characters who we can imagine actually knowing, and liking, in real life (something we had in the best examples of the original series as well, but lacked, entirely, in the first movie).  We got drama from situations which, while wrapped in science-fiction trappings, were really about the most fundamental human emotions...  a villain who has (understandable, if irrational) rage issues directed against the hero, and a hero who feels that his life is \\"winding down\\" and sees all the lost opportunities and mistakes behind him.<br /><br />It's a trope that \\"Captain Kirk slept with every girl he met\\" in the original series (it's not really true, by the way, but it's a trope nevertheless).  This movie showed the \\"leading man romantic\\" role he often filled in a very different light, by introducing the great love of his life, the \\"little blonde lab tech\\" he was mentioned as having \\"almost married\\" in the very first appearance of Kirk in the original series, and it turns out that he also has a son...  a son who doesn't know that Kirk is his father.  It actually explains quite a bit, and shows that there are consequences we all have to deal with for our choices.  And, thankfully, this turns out OK in the end (at least in this film!)<br /><br />The dialog is written so well, even with somewhat different visuals, there's no question but that these are the same characters we know and love from the original series.  It's dramatic, when appropriate, funny (in a realistic way, not a slapstick way) when appropriate, and just COMFORTABLE all the rest of the time.  No stilted \\"science-fictiony\\" dialog, just normal people having normal conversations about imporant things in their lives.<br /><br />The acting also reflects the pinnacle of the Star Trek films, and is a key element to the above.  Nick Meyer did a terrific turn as director, and as a result even some of the more lackluster actors turn in terrific performances.  I'm not a huge George Takei fan overall (\\"Sulu\\"), and I never really liked the Chekov character (though I grew to love Walter Koenig, the actor who played him, through watching Babylon 5) but this film shows both of these guys at their best.  Nichele Nichols, as Uhura, does a good job, but she's probably the most underutilized original-series actor in this film (a sad but necessary requirement of reasonable storytelling (the comms officer is seldom going to be a major player in real-life events, and in this film, the storytelling tool priority over \\"giving everyone their moment\\"...  something later films ended up trying, way too hard at times, to do)  James Doohan's turn as Scotty in this film was also \\"lightly written\\" but had some really good moments.  But, as with the original series, this movie was built around the \\"big three trio,\\" Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.<br /><br />One of the things that made the original series work so well was that the big-three characters sort of grew into psychological archetypes...  Kirk as the \\"superego\\" (The psychology term for the part which makes decisions, based upon the input of the other two elements), the \\"ego\\" (the logical, rational side of our mind), through Spock, and the ID (the emotional, feelings-based side of our minds) which obviously was McCoy.  This is very clearly played out in a sequence in this film, set in Kirk's cabin, where they discuss the concept of \\"Genesis\\" in this film.<br /><br />Finally, this film did something I LOVED.  It took risks, and make \\"permanent\\" changes to the status-quo, in universe.  (I put \\"permanent\\" in quotes because, unfortunately, some of these \\"permanent\\" changes got reversed later...  so the brave choices made in this film largely got erased in later films, putting us back into the \\"status quo,\\" which was just a horrible mistake as far as I'm concerned!)<br /><br />The best films, but best TV shows, the best storytelling in general, must involve REAL GROWTH AND CHANGE.  This is part of why Babylon 5 remains my all-time favorite TV series...  and why, from a pure storytelling perspective, Deep Space Nine may in fact be the best drama told in the Star Trek universe.  You have to have real jeaopardy, real risk.  Characters... BELOVED characters...  need to be at real risk, and occasionally may need to die... and STAY THAT WAY.<br /><br />Otherwise, none of the storytelling ends up having any real impact.<br /><br />This film made real changes.  It introduced two three major new characters, all of whom should have become part of the \\"recurring cast\\" for future films (but one of whom was never seen again, one of whom was later removed entirely, and one of whom was badly recast... no offense to the replacement, but this character ceased to be the same character!)<br /><br />The situation at the end of the film isn't the same as we saw during the original TV series, or at the beginning of the film.  Characters have changed, new relationships are being formed...  and new character dynamics would likely be present in future films.  It was...  perfect.  It just works.  Beautifully.<br /><br />Later Star Trek movies were still fairly good, to varying degrees, but they lost sight of the \\"story first, above all\\" on occasion...  needing to give every actor their \\"moment\\" in each film (even if it doesn't really serve the storytelling), or drawing back from taking big risks, or (worst of all) REVERSING the \\"changes\\" which this film gave us, instead putting us back into the \\"same thing, with no changes, but with older actors\\" situation.<br /><br />The last \\"Original series\\" film was also the second best...  \\"The Undiscovered Country.\\"  It's no shock that this film was also helmed by Nick Meyer, and while a bit lesser than this film, it's a fine film as well.  And it also deals with real change, albeit in different ways.<br /><br />If you only watch ONE Star Trek film, this is the one to watch.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well other than Game of Thrones. But Season after season this is just an outstanding show. Absolutely scary and really well acted. Awesome.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I rented the streamed version of the animated movie Up.  Up has something for everyone; kids, tweens, teens and adults.  It has drama, suspense, and comedy.  It is an enjoyable movie that kids won't want to see just once.
1616960922|5.0|The author proves that a story doesn't have to fill lots of pages to be complete and powerful.  It's not the number of words on the paper that are important, it's the quality and completeness of the images those words create in the reader's mind.  I get it!!!!  Whoa, now it makes me stop to consider who the \\"Forger\\" really is, and what they actually did.  Love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wow, the grammar is so bad I swear a 13 year old wrote it.  I also believe the only words this woman knows is \\"holy <add in expletive>\\" as it is littered throughout the book.  Nothing is realistic at all.  If you want to write about a fantasy, write about a realistic fantasy!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|And I thought Angry Birds is addicting! I love Angry Birds,and I think this is an excellent edition to the Angry Birds family! Instant favorite!  I was hooked from level one! You wont regret the download of this amazing app!
B001BC5HXG|5.0|East of Eden is one of my favorite works of fiction.  It is rich and multi-layered.  That the allegory is so obvious does not detract from the story, since it is, in essence, a universal tale of human nature.  The Grapes of Wrath (Steinbeck's more famous novel) is more political, while East of Eden is, again, a study of human nature.  Between the two, I find East of Eden to be better written.  Both have intercallary chapters, but whereas the intercallary chapters in Grapes of Wrath seem like abrupt diversions from the main story, they are better integrated within the immediate world of the characters of interest in East of Eden.<br /><br />I read East of Eden when I was 15 (it was part of my high school curriculum), and I've decided to read it again, at the age of 29.  I am certain that I will appreciate facets of the work that escaped me 14 years ago.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a must-read.  One of the great works of American literature.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|Received when I was supposed to. Blue ray plays perfectly. Great pricing. Movies was right along the Resident Evil line. Loved it!
6305752672|1.0|The Crusierweight title match between Disco Inferno & Lash LaRoux was indyish as you can get but probably the best that could have been expected. The 3 way World Tag Team title match(The First Family(Brain Knobbs & Hugh Morris) vs. Harlem Heat vs. Billy Kidman & Konnan) was like Spiderman's One More Day comic:utter junk. The Eddie Guerrero-Perry Saturn match was dull. The Berlyn-Brad Armstrong match was a total squash and utterly ridiculous. The TV title match between Chris Benoit & Rick Steiner was not great but pretty good. The Lex Luger-Bret Hart match was pretty boring with a dumb finish to boot. The World title match between Sting & Hulk Hogan was a extreme dud. The United States title match between Sid Vicious & Bill Goldberg was over-promised & under-delivered. The Strap match between DDP & Rick Flair was pretty much a feel nothing brawl with a weird ending to boot. The World title match between Sting & Bill Goldberg was a no sell flop. I give this PPV a 1 out of 10.
B0098VXE50|3.0|Snow white isnt in category as Avengers or Hunger games. Its decent. Charlzie Theoron makes your spine cringe as evil as can be and still puts the competition to sleep with her looks. One scene she is cream colored into the agless bath. Kristen Stewart on other hand cant act and movie would be much better if someone else was in role. Chris Hemworth and the dwarfs are great.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|The. Greatest. Game. Eva. This game is probably my  favorite game on my Kindle. Great addition to the Angry Birds family. Love the pigs and I cannot wait for the next update! Keep it up Rovio!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have loved every Ken Follett Book I have read...and I've read almost all of them.  THis Century Series is absolutely wonderful!<br />Noone writes epic historical fiction better than Ken Follett!  The history lessons are acurate and amazing. THe characters are unforgettable!<br />Don't Miss this series.  It's Follett at his best!!
B00943SQCI|5.0|Johnny Depp brings to life a man whose lost the love of his life, his humanity and his family....plus 300 years!  Now he's back with his new family, his new/old love and it brings out his lost humanity.  Only Johnny Depp has the talent to do all the above and have a blast doing it!!  Love this film!
B0031R5K8Q|4.0|This book helped a lot with recognising that babies aren't always hungry but can be bored/tired etc too. I liked the section on body language for babies. V useful
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The characters are well explained and the bond between Abby and Travis is undeniable. Can't wait to read Travis's side to it!
0385344333|5.0|A Wanted Man is another more introspective one as in Nothing to Lose.  While this type of book is different for Lee Child, it gives more insight into Jack Reacher again.  I was totally immersed in the pacing.  It was like a minor interlude, a brief interruption in his hitchhiking to Virginia, but ironically not so minor in the extent of what happens in that space of time.  As always, I can't wait to see where life takes Jack Reacher from here.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Valentine got what he deserve finally!!!  Valentine was some kind mad scientist. Love Simmon and Clary friendship. And finally for Jace and Clary. Can't wait to see what in store in the next book!!!!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I thought that the movie was actually pretty good. I've heard a lot about how Kristen Stewart can't act, and while I wish that she had conveyed a little bit more emotion she didn't do that bad. Chris Hemsworth was fantastic at playing a tortured soul. And Charlize Theron, was absolutely AMAZING! I did not like how it ended...that was the one draw back to this movie. That and I personally couldn't find how to view the Extended edition on my dvd, but I'll live. I was glad I added this to my collection!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love me some Gideon!!! This book had scared for a moment. I didn't know what was going on with Gideon. I was like Eva you better start calling Brett. Poor Cary getting all caught up In mess and didn't even know it.<br /><br />So upset that they change the date of the next... Booooo!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I started using Evernote in my laptop, and since then I've used it in everything: on my Kindle, my cell phone, and my opossum. very useful for keeping notes organized and easily accessible from everywhere!
B001HN697M|5.0|Although this is the second of the Underworld series released, it's actually the pre-quel to the series. The war between the lycans and the vampires is gone into in great detail and sets the tone for the rest of the series. If you like the Underworld series and don't own this, you should.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|My friend buy it from here for me , and it is work very smoothly on my 1512+ without any problem waiting him to try it on his DS 1812+.<br /><br />Good choice ;)
B000F6IOBQ|5.0|Kate Beckinsale continues to excel in the Underworld movies with this being no exception to that. The death dealer that is a formidable killer on one hand, yet her humanity peeks through. I believe Ms. Beckinsale to be quite possibly the best and hottest actress in the business and this movie only proves that further. Her portrayal of Selene is simply stunning! A must have.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game! a fun game. Not as easy as it looks. Just when you think you have it down the game changes.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Kate Beckinsale returns as the death dealer with a human side to her vampirism. This may be her greatest work in the Underwold series. As long as Ms. Beckinsale cranks these out, I'll be buying them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just reread it. great the first time and even better the second after watching the movie!  think i may reread it again.
B0091V6TF4|2.0|Not all the music is from the Iconic Box Office favorites......some of the music is not easily recognizeable as Bond Music at all.....<br />I think there are enough favorites to satisfy the nostalgia buff ....but they could have done a better job at assembling what to put on the album.....after all, this is supposed to be the 50 year anniversary, they should have dispensed with the traditional method of including a sample of producer's favorites, and unleashed a torrent of the customer's ear candy instead.....<br />finally, I have acquired a true understanding of the configuration known as 'digitally remastered' - some of these selections are in their original recorded format.....as a result, ( I have a pretty powerful sound system in my car) .....they played extremely tinny and dated....they did not satisfy my listening enjoyment due to the technology disparity....the music that I heard in my head from memory,  while anticipating the arrival of the CD ....sounded much better than the final product.....in the future I am going to look for the 'digitally remastered' designation before buying another one these potpourri conglomerations......
B009IU6N5Y|3.0|Definitely one of those movies whose enjoyment is directly correlated with the expectations of the viewer going in.  Given that I expected total garbage, I was pleasantly suprised to come away feeling like it was a good movie (for what it is). That being said, if it's a rainy day, there's nothing on tv, and you don't feeling like starting a good book - then this movie can provide some light entertainment to get you through an afternoon.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|A lot of people only know a couple of songs from this album like \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" or \\"Hot N Cold\\".  Those are two great songs but if you haven't listened to the whole album you are really missing out.<br /><br />I am one of the biggest Katy Perry fans and I would say this album isn't as good as \\"Teenage Dream\\" but that's only because \\"Teenage Dream\\" is just way too amazing, nobody else can compete with Katy Perry as far as that album goes.<br /><br />But before \\"Teenage Dream\\" came I thought that nobody would make a pop album as perfect as \\"One of the Boys\\".<br /><br />The best songs on this are probably \\"Ur So Gay\\" and \\"Thinking of You\\" both of these are songs written mainly by Katy Perry herself and are a perfect example of what makes her so awesome and unlike any singer that has come before her.<br /><br />I would say this is the \\"Star Wars\\" to Teenage Dream's \\"Empire Strikes Back\\".  An awesome album that set the stage for an even more super awesome follow-up.  If Katy Perry continues to top herself I can only imagine how amazing her third album is going to be.  It's going to rule!
B000WTXCZO|5.0|This is a great CD. The ABB live is something to behold. The recording is great, the songs are great, the guitar work is awesome. This is a must have for any ABB fan. If you are just getting into them this is a great place to start and you will not be disappointed.
B009B50QOU|3.0|I've been a Green Day fan since \\"Dookie,\\" and there's plenty to like with this new album. However, after the achievements of \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"21st Century Breakdown,\\" it's a surprise to see them release an album this one-dimensional. I've found that the songs sound considerably better when they show up in a random play of songs I've purchased this year. When I play the album from start to finish, though, the sameness starts to get old. In many ways, this has more in common with their Foxboro Hot Tubs album than any of their recent releases. Definitely still worth it for songs like \\"Stay the Night,\\" \\"Sweet 16\\" and \\"Oh Love,\\" but this is far from their best.
B009LZDGSI|5.0|Great new Fall series!  Jonny Lee Miller doesn't disappoint as Sherlock and Lucy Liu is a wonderful refreshing twist to Watson.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore was fun to read. Felt like I was a fly on the wall while the bookstore's mysteries were being pursued. Very visual writing style. Even though the \\"inside\\" scoop on the Google campus was fantasized, I enjoyed rummaging around in all things Google. Felt the story could have had a little more \\"edginess,\\" but not sure what that would be. Anyway, I really enjoyed the story and would recommend it to all the techies out there.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is my favorite great new series of the Fall.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu make an amazing Sherlock and Watson with fantastic on screen chemistry!
1451629192|1.0|This book was so poorly written and organized, it was painful to read.  While I understand the desire to have the author share her experience in her own words, this book would have benefited enormously from an editor's hand without undermining the desired intimacy.  For instance, the same statements were repeated, over and over, sometimes within the same paragraph. Also, so little contextual information was provided, that the reporting was confusing.  For instance, I couldn't tell if Nancy and Phillip Garrido lived in a larger home with plumbing, or whether the property simply consisted of a series of sheds. Further, it would have been useful to have some background information about Garrido's criminal history, his prior victims' and his relationship with Nancy.  Further, the question never addressed, which frankly begged to be answered, was whether Jaycee was ever concerned with the prospect that daughters' would be targeted by Garrido, whether he ever made such attempts, and whether other girls were victimized during the periods he was absent. Finally, the book would also have benefited from a postscript on the ensuing prosecution of Garrido and his wife, the extent to which mental illness factored into his prosecution, whether any of the parole officers' assigned to Garrido were ever held accountable, and whether any changes were instituted in law enforcement procedures as a result of this case.  Frankly, the book raised more questions than it answered.
B00684J49U|5.0|SinceI don't get to watch it during the regular TV season; I look forward to watching it oer several evenings.  Love it & they always leave you hanging until the next season.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I'm such a hopeless romantic.  I loved this series enough to warrant the purchase of my own discs.  I even bought the series for my Fire.  Got my co-worker interested and she has been watching an episode a day on my Fire during her lunch hour.  Now she's hooked and bought this boxed set for her daughter!  Love the packaging on this too.  The jury is still out as to Season 2, but Season 1 is so very magical!  If you look beyond the fantasy, the lessons learned have a lot of esoteric value--IF you can get past the fantasy:)--your choice!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game to play while the cowboy here watches his Tv shows you can play it while watching Tv and don't have to worry about losing your place ...fun for the grandkids to play to its just a great game to play....Irishcowgirl
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I like this book way better than the first. The first book has way too many similarities to Fifty Shades. This book develops more characters and the relationship between Gideon and Eva.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|An excellent trip back in time. I had no idea King was or could be such an accurate historian, and I'm a qualified judge since I lived through the times he described. I wept over reminders of the Cuban Missile Crisis. All in all a highly entertaining read.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|This is the second copy of this CD that I have purchased. The first was for me. I have a 1 year old and have been rocking him to sleep with this album on in the background since he was born. When we start rocking at night he's usually asleep before the second track ends. I think he recgonizes the songs and associates it with bedtime. The second copy is for my best friend who just had her own bundle of joy. This album never gets \\"loud\\" which is great since babies can startle so easily. Celine has a great voice and these songs are sweet and memorable.
B007QPFGJW|1.0|His recent book pales in comparison to his previous ones.  It is difficult to follow, not particularly interested and the ending is disappointing
B004UA8D2S|1.0|this is a B movie, nothing happens, I can't beleive cinemax is playing this, what a waste of our time, hope this helps you
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app allows me to see approximately how much time I have, before I need to charge my Kindle Fire. I highly recommend it!
B007BT0RKG|4.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire.  It works great as a replacement for a paper map.  Since the kindle I have does not have GPS I can't comment on that functionality.  You do have to zoom in a ways sometimes to see what you are looking for, but over all it works great.  Since it is a free version there is no search.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This was a very well written book but the ending upset me considerably. I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend other works by this author
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is an easy read providing an interesting perspective.  While I'm sure this is not the whole story it is a good story from the perspective of one of the participants.  I've worked closely with the military the past two years in Afghanistan and enjoyed this perspective of the achievement.  Definitely worth the read.
0439023491|5.0|This was an amazing book. It kept me on my toes. Surprises around every corner. Once I started reading the book it was hard to put it down. It's a book I know I'll read again. Can't wait till the movie comes out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Hands down one of the best apps on my Kindle Fire. Easy to navigate, great graphics! I can't live without it.
B00943SP0G|2.0|I actually made the mistake of buying this film because Amazon didn't have it available for rent at the time and my elderly grandmother really wanted to see it. Afterwards she complained that it wasn't a good movie. :-/ Sometimes Johnny Depp is great (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean) - this isn't one of those time. If you are looking for a film that you can zone out to (or watch while reading a more interesting book) and maybe get a couple of mild laughs out of, this is it. However, it is otherwise entirely predictable - all of the conclusions are forgone, and you find yourself hoping for it to be over with already. I wish I could get my money back.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|With Judy Dench and Maggie Smith in a film about English people who come to stay  at a hotel in an exotic landscape, one is tempted to make comparisons with \\"A Room With A View\\";  you could, but that'd be like trying to link \\"Doc Martin\\" to \\"Northern Exposure\\", sure there are comparisons to be had, yet at the end it's an exercise in wishful thinking.  But don't think that this film doesn't measure up.<br /><br />With each having his own reasons, a group of aging Brits find themselves staying at The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, in Jaipur;  an old Raj Era hotel that may have started business as a palace, run by an earnest young man who's trying to succeed where his father's life dream failed:  Bring the hotel back to its glory, and make money, albeit as a home for seniors, in effect out-sourcing the West's old folk who can't afford to live with dignity in their own country.  The young man is Dev Patel, who at times seems the embodiment of a Disney animated character.  His persona is that of a sweet faced, earnest young man, but that facade breaks (frequently) and his eyes widen, he smiles broadly and reveals a goofier interior.  It reminds me of Shaggy, in his earlier work (\\"Carolina\\") where the tough-cool reggae image would also crack, he'd throw his head back, roll his eyes and grin broadly;  it's an endearing trait in both.<br /><br />The basic idea of the film is that a bunch of Westerners come to India to live out their lives, and die, and in the process discover an entirely new life they'd never imagined.  And for the most part that is the film, but there's a downside, sort of like the politician behind the ads:  Like entirely too many Western films, there is a not so subtle racism that permeates the film.  The Indians, in their own country, are clearly made out to be the lesser beings;  how they managed to build a civilization, let alone one of the world's booming modern economies; how Indian men stood up to their mothers, on behalf of their girl friends, or rantheir businesses without the help of a kindly white person is anybody's guess.  You see it all the time on this side of the pond, with minorities in film and TV:  \\"Northern Exposure\\" and it's sub-caste natives;  African Americans get it all the time, playing the sage, the pimp, the maid---kindly and knowing; the fool, but almost never the equal.  In the end it makes us white folks look bad.<br /><br />Having said that, if I walked out of every film that irritated me in one way or another, I'd have given up on films altogether by now.  I think the issue needs to be dealt with, and it would help if more people tagged the behavior when it's manifested.<br /><br />The movie is very entertaining, romantic, and funny by turns;  the story unfolding mostly within the hotel, but there are wonderful street scenes that provide interest and color, and in some instances, glimpses of modern India, where a big new concrete tower rises amidst fields of trash and dirt;  with the tents of the workers making a temporary slum alongside (if we remember our \\"Shantaram\\").  It probably would have been better if the perspective had been reversed, with the white folks as incidentals and the Indians carrying more of the story, an Indian film in other words;  but for what it is, it is very watchable and would bear multiple viewings.<br /><br />I should note that I watched the streaming version and the quality was quite good.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Oh what a feeling. I walk around between floors with the sound as good as sitting next to the PC. There is no outside noise so I am totally in the game. Great. I recommend it highly.
034580404X|5.0|The trilogy is a must.  When I first started reading book one, I was a little concerned that all it was about was the sexual aspect, but that quickly changed.  It just kept getting better and better and I couldn't put it down.  I might hold the record for the fastest reading of all three books!  It is a wonderful series and I loved it.  I even read it twice and will read it again and again.
B0095R64AO|1.0|Had a few funny parts but it was really crude and disappointing. Jason Segel needs to redeem himself after such a long, in-funny comedy.

I have read a few chapters so far and the story is ok. It's kinda interesting I do want to continue reading to see how it ends. Anyway an ok book so far. I admire the writer for writing so many and detialed person experiences. Anyway the book came it time before we started talking about it in class and was and is in great condition.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I believe that this is a really dumb book and not worth reading!  The story line is filled with unbelievable actions and scene changes that can't be true.
B003MC5N28|4.0|It was a really good book. Very interesting and hard to put down, I absolutely enjoyed this book! I recommend reading this book.
0345803485|1.0|The subject matter did not set well with me. And too unbelievable. Woman graduating from college a virgin! An educated, smart woman falling for this guy just didn't go over with me. Didn't finish, threw it in the garbage. I didn't want to continue to see if she kept going further and further with his control over her. Didn't even want to continue to see if at sometime she got some sense in her and dumped him. Portrayed woman as gullible and stupid!
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I've read and enjoyed the author's other books.  This was a fast and boring read. Couldn't wat to finish it and it really didn't impart any messages that people with average intelligence don't already know.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|I bought her first CD \\"Lungs\\" at the same time time as this CD because I really like her happy, fun songs.<br />A friend sent me a link to one of her songs on youtube and I enjoyed it very much so I watched/Listened to several of her songs on youtube. that motivated me to check Amazon for her CD and I found she has two CD's out. Actually she has four since both \\"Lungs\\" and \\"Ceremonials\\" are available with bonus tracks so that is what I got so I could get as many of her songs as possible.<br /><br />I am 59 and don't listen to much modern (current) music and I really don't like rap, hip-hop, and other popular sounds but this music I really rave about to all my friends.<br /><br />Check out youtube and see if you like her fun and energetic music.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the first book and I adored the second!  I was riveted the whole book, the end was perfect.  I can't wait for the next book!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Just thought I would contribute my 2c:<br /><br />I actually really enjoyed this novel, Rowling undeniably does know how to write a page-turner. No, there were no noble 17-year-old teenagers willing to sacrifice their lives for their friends. Yes, there are lots of teenage sh*ts who act like teenagers (whine, fantasize about sex, hate their parents, make life difficult for other teenagers). No, none of the characters are particularly likable (apart from the dead guy, who was apparently a saint). Yes, everything is bleak.<br /><br />In other words, my kind of book :)
B00973DDN2|5.0|I have literally been listening to this entire album over and over since I got it when it first came out. It hasn't gotten old and I don't think it will. This is the best album I've heard in a long time. Must buy.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|Well, this is a must for people who like a light but clever book. It draws you in slowly and then you're hooked! It is a story of a 100 year old man who is in a home. He is due to have a party with a cake and 100 candles. The thought of this is all too awful so he just , climbs out of the window and disappears. The book alternates between his ludicrous present day adventures and his past fascinating life.<br /><br />It is tongue in cheek, very funny, drole and clever. The English is great. It is in the same vein as the movie Fargo. Clever. I LOVED it.
B00834PFC8|5.0|These guys have Sherlock and Watson down pat!!  This one in particular is excellent!!  There's so much going on.  I've watched it 3 times and still love watching it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Sorry, but I didn't finish the book. It did not hook me in. In fact I found most of it rather boring. What is the story line anyway.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is an excellent show. The acting, plot and filming are better than the movies I've seen lately. I highly recommend this series.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I didn't know who these guys were until a few weeks ago, but I suppose that's alright since \\"An Awesome Wave\\" is Alt-J's first record.<br /><br />I'd call this album an unexpected gem. Not for everyone, but certainly for me.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|I was expecting more. The songs you hear played  on the radio, etc. are definitely the best. A few of them just sound like some college dude sitting on stage strumming three chords in a hip dive bar.<br /><br />I give it a 3.5
B009KUANWG|5.0|Certainly Adele is one my favorite artists.  She does her usual marvelous job singing the theme for the latest James Bond movie; Skyfall.  I would give the song a 007 rating; excellent.  You should buy Skyfall by Adele.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|not too bad....cant wait for part 2<br />it wasn't too hard or too easy...very enjoyable and liked the story line
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|LOVE Rick Riordan books, especially the Olympian books! And I am an adult, in fact a senior. His stories are always engaging, well told and well worth my time. Can't wait til the next installment!
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Being a loyal Dark Shadows fan I was initially upset when first viewing the released clips of this movie.  After doing more viewing and finally seeing the movie I see it as others interpertation and views of Dark Shadows.  I found it to be creative and artistic with excellent humour.  Thank you Tim Burton, Johnny Depp ant all of the wonderful cast. I predict it will become a cult classic.  My favorite lines, He's coming, /that is the ugliest woman I ever saw, all the lines about the devil and many more.  This movie finally made me buy a blu-ray player.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is one of the greatest i have read! It‘s very detailed. Riordan does a great job showing the character‘s feelings. i reccommend reading every one of his books!
B00933ZG9A|5.0|This series is amazing.  I do not get cable.  It is not provided in my area.  Thought I would try the series because it won so many awards.  A must see!!!
B007QPFGJW|2.0|I love Jo Nesbo and the way he lays out his main character Harry Hole and the challenges he reluctantly faces. His writing style seems to have acquired different layers of subconscious musings by people who were already killed off. Definitely, a candidate for a Film Noir script and movie. I like his compactness in describing action scenes, and in this respect he has not diminished his appeal. But frankly, I didn't much like this book. Perhaps, it's because I don't really like the drug scene, in whatever country, and find the details of addiction and shooting-up unappealing. And the ending. Well, I won't give that away. Not very satisfactory. Sorry Jo. I am still your fan.
B0091REZMW|3.0|okay... i have played this game for five minutes and it wants me to rate it already.... good game so far... i must type twenty words???  i surpassed this requirement &amp; still it will not accept... ohhhh... i had to give it stars... duh...  maybe a better review once i play it a bit more.... on a kindle fire &amp; so far no prob but only on level three
B00493E1GI|3.0|This isn't Kierkegaard.  It's the kind of film you watch when you feel like kicking back, relaxing with a chick flick that is formulaic and goes well with ice cream.<br /><br />Julia Roberts is always fun.  The story was....okay.  A little too predictable with each city providing a neat little package of experiences.  The romance was predictable. The Yoda-type spiritual guide just a little too cute.  The end was  neat and tidy, and of course she's going to end up with the guy.  Based on the kind of book that is published because it will sell well to the film studios, and will sell well to women readers.
B007QUUIEA|5.0|The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a brilliant book about a young boy in school. It really captures his feelings about his life and shows the everyday life of a teenager. A definite must read for teenagers.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This was an excellent book.  My wife and I both read it and even though we weren't having any major issues.  We learned a lot and now our marriage is even better.  I highly recommend this book no matter where you are at in your marriage...
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run! its so fun says funus. you should so get temple run its amazingly fun ya ha
B009LH1WLO|5.0|How many stars would I give this? I would give it all the stars, and then I would draw some more stars on my screen. Don't ask stupid questions, Amazon. And don't email devoted fangirls in an attempt to solicit non-biased reviews. This episode could have been a steaming pile of ghoul shat and I'd still be singing its praises because I'm loyal like that.<br />Feel free to delete this review.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is for people who enjoy a puzzle and a challenge. like me; I like this game I always find it out&hellip;
B008VBYN80|5.0|love it pretty cool probably best game on kindle fire idk but fun..... only problem u would have is the energy on this game not so much of it so....
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so fun I love trying to do the missions and get gadgets it is awesome when you see all of the prizes
B0001WGDXK|3.0|In the end, I find this set to be a very mixed bag, both in terms of content and level of performance. The disc of English music is a split decision: I'm not particularly enamored of this performance of Elgar's Enigma Variations, which seem to grind on in a heavy way, but the Britten Sea Interludes are adequately done. For the Elgar, my preferences are Boult, Barbirolli and Zinman; for the Britten Interludes, if I must state a preference, I'd opt for Previn on EMI. So one disc out of the three doesn't make a compelling argument to acquire this set. The remaining two discs are all Sibelius: Symphonies 1, 2, 5 and 7, the only ones that Bernstein recorded for Deutsche Grammophon. More than one reviewer has described this performance of the Second Symphony as overwrought, and I wouldn't disagree, although there are times when I'm in the mood the handle it done that way. This Bernstein recording of the Fifth Symphony, on the other hand, strikes me as rather amorphous -- and in my opinion the music is a bit amorphous to begin with and requires some analytic definition, which we don't get this time. So, to me, this is not a good performance of the work. At least one other reviewer has raved over this rendition of the First Symphony, and I'll admit that it's okay, especially in the beginning, but as time goes on it strikes me as a bit too brash -- not as bad in that regard as the performance of No. 2, but getting there. The performance of the Seventh Symphony is the real gem of this set. Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic set their emotional gears just right as this work shifts in and out of its varying moods. So where does this put us? If you just want to hear Bernstein do Sibelius, I find the old New York Philharmonic recordings to be superior overall. If you want a full Sibelius cycle, my top recommendations would be Davis and the Boston Symphony or Segerstam and the Helsinki Philharmonic. For the cost of a full-price disc, however, you do get a good performance of the Sibelius Symphony No. 2 and performances of the Nos. 1 and 2 that you'll enjoy if you like this music played with somewhat undisciplined emotion. Your own preferences will have to tip the balance one way or the other.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|this movie is so Awesome!!  If I had enough money, I would watch it over and over and over!!!!  Thanks!![[ASIN:B003U6BE8I Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I usually don't care for the &quot;endless run&quot; genre, but I've really enjoyed this one. It's fun without buying any content, but consider doing so to support a good developer.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I loved their first studio album, so I had high hopes for this one and it did not disappoint. I love the singles that I've heard on the radio, but all of the tracks are GREAT!! Their sound is much more polished on this album, and their songs are still stirring and fun.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|I think it was a good read, very simple to understand.  He wrote this book in laymen's terms, though this size of the book is intimidating at first, as you read Mr. Ferris tells you to read only what you need from the book.  Somehow that relaxed me and I was actually able to read all that I needed and more from the book.<br /><br />He is definately a different kind of writer.  He speaks his mind, but at the same time, he is funny in a lot of ways.  I chuckled and laughed out loud more than a few times while reading the book and could relate to a lot of his illustrations and examples.<br /><br />At times, while reading the book, I would say \\"this man has a problem!\\",  \\"He's crazy!\\", \\"There's somthing's wrong with him!\\", \\"Really, Mr. Ferris?\\", \\"OMG!\\"  But, by the time I got to the end of the book, or completed what I personally needed from the book, I understood that Tim Ferry is the kind of author that wants to tell you from experience how to use the book, and how it personally benefited him.  I can respect that from anyone that writes a book as genuine as he wrote this one.<br /><br />While reading the book I also looked him up on YouTube.com and I saw him on various TV shows and diet program shows, seminars and other media outlets, including the TV show, The View.  I was impressed with him and his young age and how serious he was about proving his ideas to be fact......, at least for him.  I also like how he gave not just experiences about people and how they benefited from his book, but how he integrated his own experieces as well.<br /><br />All the hundreds of thousands of dollars he spent to prove some things work and some don't was awsome.<br /><br />Ultimately, I find this a good read and very educational.  A lot of the ideas I have personally implemented myself since reading the book and I have found them to be good for me personally.<br /><br />I respect any man that puts himself out there for his readers as a \\"guinea pig\\" to prove his ideas.  Great job Mr.Ferris!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It's basically a Cinderella story gone porn; women is intrigued by a successful man on his terms then after the relationship starts then wants to change him to something that would please her. She adds nothing to the relationship other than being a sex toy but now feels cheapened
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Watching Scott's re-entry into the world of [[ASIN:B004RE29T0 Alien [Blu-ray]]] reminds you that there just aren't enough filmmakers around who really believably create philosophically interesting movies, in painstakingly created universes, designed to both entertain and make you think.  It's a treat to see him back in the genre.  Here, his original Alien movie has been used as a kick off point only.  Although, as he puts it, the `DNA' of that movie can be found here, this is not a direct prequel.  It simply happens in the same world, and has some fanboy satisfying nods to the original.  Here, the tone is markedly different, setting out a larger question on a more epic scale... how were we created? If life can be created in a lab, who then is the god?<br />We start briefly on Earth, where a couple of scientists have found common themes in petroglyphs around the globe, persuading them that these are a map, an invitation if you will, to come visit.  And so this movie is that deep space expedition, now funded by Weyland Corporation represented by the icy cool Charlize Theron.  Of course, things don't work out for the scientific expedition quite as expected once they arrive.  Soon vials of black goo are infecting the crewmembers and creatures start to appear in which the sharp eyed will see links back to Giger's original designs.  Don't go expecting the same claustrophobia of the original however.  Here the canvas is much more open, with sweeping vistas and grand set pieces.  Scott's eye for design is as evident as ever, and the effects uniformly satisfying, not least due to his penchant for creating real sets and props as much as possible, limiting the uses of cgi to areas you might not even realise.  Ultimately though, the movie is most satisfying in its almost arthouse beauty and grandeur in the first half.  As it lurches into elements of action and horror, the tension is never as vivid and the action beats never as shocking as you might expect.  Crucially, some plotelements are just a little fuzzy, and it takes the captain of the vessel to walk in to one scene and in a few sentences of exposition suddenly explain out of the blue what is happening, for things to start to come together.  The nagging questions at the end are mostly deliberate creation of mystery, but there are a few things that are not obvious that perhaps should be, and so the end is not wholly satisfying.<br />The 3D is actually probably the most satisfying since Avatar, in that it is never obtrusive or distracting, and the extras, ranging from the multiple commentaries, 3 hour 40 minute documentary (in modular format to let you jump in and out as you wish) and myriad of other materials including about 40 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, make for a terrific package.  Certainly watching the documentary was gripping and exhaustively illuminating in its discussion on how the details of the design came together, and the deleted scenes help illustrate some of the ideas that were left on the shelf.. and its nice to find the scene that was intended as a precursor to that scene of the Captain's exposition, to understand it was not always intended to be so out of the blue.<br />All in all, this is a great package, of a fascinating, though not perfect movie.  Even where it doesn't work completely, the ambition and vision is laudable.  Recommended - 7/10
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I read and continue reading many books about Second World War, the most important event of the 20th century, certainly one of the crucial events of History ever.<br /><br />But never did I read a so complete, dramatic and astonishingly real personal description of the heroism, but also the savagery, the dirt, the uglyness, the sadness and the seemengly unsurmontable difficulties and suffering war means to a simple Infantry soldier -- in this case, an Marine infantryman, and everything seen through his perspective.<br /><br />Additionally, Sledges's book is of great literaty value, also. Some accomplishment for a biologist.
B002LL1686|4.0|Bought this Blu-Ray disc without checking the region code. Big mistake!  When the movie arrived in the mail, I tried to play it in my Panasonic BD player, but the disc won't play because of the wrong region code.  This disc is region B and C.  My player only plays region A movies.  I give this movie a 4 out of 5 star rating even though it's been since 2009 since I went to the movie in the theater.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its ok. a little hard to manuver thru on the kindle fire &amp; doesn't read everytime u complete a mission. but overall its ok.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app for the time I have used it has gave me not one problem. I stay connected to Wifi so it stays up to date and changes on predictions quickly.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|Pure mastery. Buddy Guy's raw power on guitar in  this recording shows a great bluesman at his absolute best. A crowing acheivement for a long and continuing career.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Loved this book but felt like I waited forever for it to come out & felt like it ended too abruptly!
B0026IUXO2|5.0|I loved this movie! I was captivated from the beginning. The way that the director created such a gloomy setting during the scenes that involved Queen Mary and then brighten the screen with Elizabeth was ingenious. It had a direct correlation with their actual realms. The Artistic Creator should be applauded as well. Extemeley accurate to the time period. The costumes and the architecture were \\"larger then life\\" to help create the attitude of the time period.<br /><br />If you like Historical Fiction then this movie is for you. Enjoy...
B008QMMEOE|5.0|Our 2 year old Grandson loves this app and is able to do it with minimal help on my Kindle Fire.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I absolutely loved loved loved this new album!!! I have been a long time No Doubt fan and I loved how they combined different sounds from different genres in this new album.  The more I listened to it the more I loved each song!!!  It's rare to purchase whole albums these days where you like most or all of the songs but I do with this one!  I highly recommend it!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved this game. Lots of hidden object scenes. Graphics are stellar. Story line is very good - keeps your interest.
B009CPGHDI|2.0|the movie was very slow and boring.  It froze 3/4 of the way into the movie and we never saw the end.  The Justin Bieber movie was much better.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Love this writer and her beautifully written prose of love, life and obligations. You will get lost in the era of heartbreak and tragedy and find your way as love prevails.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|Awesome, funny, true to original story. Burton is a master and Depp is, as usual, giving his all. 2 thumbs up!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was the sequel to Bared toYou and it was so intense I couldn't put it down. This book was very well written.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just loved this book. i read the 1st,Bare to You,and could not wait to read this one.I think the third one will be out in december,and i will be getting that too.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoy this game. One that I can come back to when other things need my attention. :) I loved playing this while traveling.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|This is a life changing book. Helps you to get out of that sofa and stop trying beeing perfect in everything!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I've already read it twice, it surely didn't disappoint, loved it & it only heightened my excitement to read the next one. Can't wait until December 31st.
0545265355|5.0|I purchased this set for my daughter.  Havn't given it to her yet - Xmas present.<br />Great purchase.  Fast service.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|What is absolutely certain in this series is the high quality of the acting. Amazing! Also, you know the marine cannot be caught else the show would end, and you try to figure out how he manages to escape detections, except in Carrie's intelligent work.
B0086700CM|5.0|Addicting when you have just a few minutes to play. Nice to have a free game that you don't need to buy stuff in order to be good at it!
B0081KTHEQ|5.0|I had read mixed reviews and not a Radcliffe fan and the novel was a classic so I passed on this for quite some time. Never too late. I've watched it several times and it's well done in every respect. Radcliffe is excellent and the balance of the cast are equal to his lead. Liz White, oddly enough, \\"The Woman in Black\\" who was so perfect in [[ASIN:B0038M2SAW Life On Mars: The Complete Collection (U.K.)]] is only seen clearly once and her voice is her biggest contribution but her, \\"Presence\\" is overwhelming. Several, \\"Jump\\" moments and a lot of carefully constructed suspense, a spot on eerie backdrop and nicely done SFX and it's an easy 5 star film, in my opinion. A lot of folks disliked the departures from the novel but I had no problem at all. Loved it.
B0087HT36U|5.0|lots of fun, angry bird like application . lots of funny super neat and fun lots of fun and fun
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is always interesting to hear from one who was there.  The writer leaves no doubt that the mission was a team action that began shortly after 9/11.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Another great one.  I can hardly put the book down once I start reading. Lots of laughs. I burst out laughing and my son wants to know what is so funny. On to number nine.
B003WUYP56|5.0|This book gives a lot to think about.  It gives a lot of physics history and a lot of concepts without mathematics, but explained in an understandable way.  The criticism of stirngs theory not being experimentally justified has been covered by many others, but this book explains the problems in manner that helps you understand what has been happening is physics even if you are like me and have trouble understanding some scientific american articles.  It is quite an easy read for a complex topic.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|2nd in the series, picked up right were the first left off...I cannot wait for the third installment to find out what happens to Gideon and his love
B0007XT87G|5.0|I've recently discovered Porcupine Tree and purchased a few of their albums.  And just like the others, Deadwing is amazing.  My favorites are Lazarus and the title track.  But there's isn't a bad song on the album.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Very weak story line in between all the porn. It's like a car accident... It's bad to see but you can't help yourself from looking. I'm glad I read it so I understand what everyone is talking about, but to have to read such poor dictation was torturous.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is much better than some of the other hidden objects games out there. Would like to see more games similar to this one for the kindle.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Very weak story line in between all the porn. It's like a car accident... It's bad to see but you can't help yourself from looking. I'm glad I read it so I understand what everyone is talking about, but to have to read such poor dictation was torturous.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great app! Lots of cool pics and recipes. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone! Get this app! Free is a great price.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I found the book boring and didn't finish it! Not enough character.development or dialogue. Lots of slow descriptions that just didn't keep me interested.
B00006AW63|1.0|Version sent was for region two - not the USA.  Very disappointed that a correct version was not supplied after return of non-usable product.  Amazon has given me a credit for the postage, but I can't figure out from their email how to access the credit.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|the app worked just fine for a few weeks now the last few days i can only see the first few status updates and thats it. This sucks
B009GEPPYC|5.0|We actually got this for \\"family movie night\\" with our teenage kids.  I didn't know it was a musical/ rock opera- after My wife and I got past that- we were hooked.  Had all the hair band music from my youth and a good story.  Noboby will believe it but the actors did a good job singing- yes, even Tom Cruise.  My wife turns on this movie instead of pandora now.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It keeps you wanting more!!! I loved it!!!<br />I can't wait for the next book about Gideon and Eva to see where they go from here.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I was not prepared for how addicted I would get to this game! And the best part? It's free! Well done, developers!
159413586X|5.0|This book hooked me right away and didn't let go.  Fast paced, great characters, wonderful story, can't wait to read the next in the series.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Our all family enjoy it. We cannot watch it twice. Good movie quality. It is so easy to rent through Amazon instant video.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett is always a good read....never read anything that I ddn't thoroly enjoy:)  I am looking forward to the next one in the trilogy but have been renovating my home so I have just a little more to go to finish this one!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I love this book and this whole series!!! Rick Riordan just keeps knocking them out of the park. Never get bored of his writing. I LOVE THIS SERIES!!! I recommend it to everyone, even tho it says it for children, its for all ages really :)
B007KDFWRG|5.0|I haven't heard a live album this good since 'Waiting for Columbus'.  Trucks talent is amazing.  His Allman roots are evident occasionally, but he is defintely in a class of his own.  One of the best blues guitarists out there today.  Tedeschi's vocals are excellent, and the rest of the band is very tight.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Great cast of characters, beautiful shots of India . This movie makes you want to go on an adventure, before retirement!
B00785P2QC|4.0|The virtual city playground game is fun. It is a good way to pass the time., especially in waiting rooms.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Missed most of Season 7 so I was excited when I saw it came out on DVD. Criminal Minds never dissapoints. My fav show!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Exceptionally well told story of the struggles and challenges our brave warriors went through. I especially enjoyed his wife's perspective inserted throughout the book at key points. I am very glad I dropped money on this book.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is at the very least as good as their last one. I can listen to while Iam working out, taking a nap or driving in my car. It is phenominal!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This guy is lucky to be alive. Eleven deployments of  ten  years ending with Bin Laden. Amazing story equal to Lone Survvor.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I am addicted to this game after playing it on my friends iPod touch. Glad to see it was available for my android phone.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed this book, however, I found it to be terribly gloomy and slow in some areas. The characters and the dialogue reminded me of the small town where I grew up. Constant gossiping and lack of respect for one another. I can't say that I would recommend it to another.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun and challenging at higher levels. If you like figuring out special details-this game is for you. Sometimes surprising answers! Put your thinking cap on!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I have been a fan of the Marvel comics characters as far back as I can remember. This movie did not disappoint!  Whedon did a marvelous job of bringing together these characters while still maintaining their unique individual personalities.  Absolutely loved this movie and have added it to my permanent collection.
0525952926|4.0|As is usual with Mr. Follett's well researched historical novels, the characters carry over well from book to book, the \\"feel\\" for the period in time is well done, and I found it difficult to stop reading it long enough to go to work...<br />I look forward to the last volume in the series.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Received my item on time and undamaged. One of the best scary movies ever made. Very good price for this item.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed this book tremendously. Mostly because it is unpredictable in many ways. Just when I thought I had it figured out, it would make another turn and something new would evolve. It was a great read, well written and kept my attention all the way through. It was one of those books that you can't put down. I love when that happens.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This movie delivers on all levels of entertainment.  It has a nice balance of heroes where everyone has their own little moment to shine.  The villain plays his role perfectly and gets handled as only Marvel Comics could have dished it out.  This movie was fun to watch and brings the stories from it's previous stories of these heroes together naturally.  This movie is truly worth buying.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A lot of research went into this book.  I love looking at a bygone era and imaging what it would be like to step back in time.  I'm more than half through it and can't wait to find out how it ends!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing!!! A real page turner.. Has you hook throughout the entire book. I'm wishing every night for my very own Gideon Cross.. extremely excited for book 3!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app it. Really does give you the info you need.<br />It tells you your battery health which I find important and I love the that it tells the temp :-)
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have loved the percy jackson books from the very beginning. I was very sad when they ended but am happy that the story is continuing. this book is an awesome way to continue with a very exciting twist. I recomend anyone who has an interest in fantasy or the greek or roman gods.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was just a little too disturbing for my taste. It starts out harmless enough and then takes a turn. I didn't like the main characters. This is not a happy ending story! There isn't even much of an ending.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|If you have a 90 something in the family or are one yourself, this book will be a wild ride of \\"what if's.\\".  On his 100th birthday, our protagonist busts out of the oldfolk's home and breaks every preconceived notion of that generation starting with the theft of a drug-runner's suit case to stashing dead bodies.  Interwoven is his life story that takes you around the world and through history of the 20th century.  This may be too much for some not particularly out for a jaunt through history, but it all adds up in the end.  A quirky, ridiculous, fun read.
B0038P2AZW|4.0|I enjoyed the story line and the special effects were good. Good sci-fi movie to watch with family or those who aren't easily scared.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this epic game on PC. Even though I have not bought it yet it seems so epic. I also like it because it has .....CREEPERS, -
0142001104|5.0|This is my favorite book - ever - because it provides practical suggestions for how to become an inspiring leader by encouraging all people to contribute their best selves to any situation.  The \\"practices\\" that Zander and Zander describe have helped me in business as well as personal leadership situations.  And each time I re-read the book, I learn something new.  Before I left the business world and recently as a consultant to nonprofit boards and Executive Directors, I have given dozens of copies of this book out to people here in the US - and overseas.  Anyone who aspires to be a successful leader should read this book.
B005HSL626|2.0|Fruit Ninja is a fun game to play but its too many glitches and ads.. Like when I was playing a glitch messed up my game.. Then after that and ad appeared and it fustraded me... When they get rid of all the glitches and ads in a middle of my games.... Then I would love to play it again.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|This was a great comedy for all  the  people who fallow this  tipes of movies. I personaly have  enjoy. Hope you will to
B000XUBF3I|5.0|I call it my easiest anti-depression over the counter remedy. It clears my mind to know that I can do as little or as much to stop procrastination and move forward with my life. Highly recommended for the overwhelmed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is captivating, from the moment I read Bared to You I wanted more and Reflected in You lived up to my expectations. Anxiously anticipating book 3!!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Without wanting to give away too many secrets, I was hooked from page one. I looked forward to coming home from work so I could continue reading. Somewhere towards the end of the book, however, I realized that the author had given up. It was like she didn't know how to properly end the saga so she just stopped writing. The last chapters ruined any prior excitement I had over the book.
B003TTIUAQ|5.0|I love this episode! Arizona is so loving and supportive. Callie's pain is heartbreaking. The Met/Christina connection is at it's best. And Alex is both his battle scarred best and touchingly vulnerable. Of course classic lines from most of the cast add the very rich icing to the cake.
B009B53LA6|3.0|Pretty good album but not the same No Doubt everyone knows and loves.  Would have been better if they had more new songs versus just adding the acoustic extras at the end, although those are nice in their own way.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It has lots of different games ive never seen before.  all of them are interesting.  I would download it again!
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun way to pass the time without having to concentrate too much. Also no problem when there are a lot of distractions.
B007MJSSCY|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It is one that should be watched more than one time to make sure you understand the plot because I found it to be very nuanced.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great movie, great effects.  Most of the marvel movies that have come out havent' lived up to the hype, this one is an exception. >LOVE it
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Couldn't wait for this book to be released and was definitely not disappointed!!!!!!!!  Love these characters so much.  This author gives us everything we could ever ask for with her writing.  Gideon and Eva R SO HOT😄.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Captivating...emotional. A very well written book were you can identity with the characters, and realize how many shades you are yourself.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I realize I'm going against the grain on this one, but I'm not thrilled at all with the Casual Vacancy. I think the writing is rough and I'm not particularly interested in the sex lives of young boys. I gave up mid-way through, although I may force myself to finish it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I purchased Once Upon a Time to watch it commerical free.  I followed the series on Tv. and looked forward to watching it again.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is the closest thing we currently have to J.D. Salinger. This, of course, implies both his incredible strengths (getting inside the heads of precocious young people and using their pain for powerful metaphorical purposes) and his occasional weaknesses (no one really talks as cleverly as his characters do, and his stories can occasionally get a bit twee with Manic Pixie Dream Girls (see, for example, \\"Paper Towns\\")). However, when he is on (most notably in the fantastic  \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" and in his newest book \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\") he is the best YA writer on the planet. \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is a dark, romantic comedy about precocious teenagers (natch) who are cancer patients (wait, what?). Oh, and did I mention that it is so ridiculously entertaining that you will read the book in a single sitting, no matter how little time you may have?  The spectre of death hangs over these kids in a way that most authors would never dare, but the warmth and humor and depth of emotion that Green brings to the table is nothing short of incredible. I challenge anyone reading this book not to immediately start recommending it to their friends the moment they put it down.  Cannot recommend it highly enough.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Why can't I get my adobe flash on my iPod and kindle. It's crazy you can't get it on either.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Rick Riordan's various YA series inevitably have the same plot: historic mythology is true, and young people endowed with special powers discover that they are part of a much larger battle between good and evil that has spanned thousands of years.  But like any good entertainer, Riordan takes this basic framework and uses it to weave enormously entertaining stories that somehow manage to simultaneously reconnect us to the roots of Western culture.  Very sneaky, yes, but worthwhile and exceptionally fun.  This third installment of the second \\"Percy Jackson\\" series is no different -- our heroes need to bridge the gap between Greek and Roman demigods while preventing Gaea (mother earth) from defeating Zeus/Jupiter and family.  Filled with humor, bad puns, and a remarkable memory about what really matters to teenagers, these stories are highly recommended for Middle Grade on up (and will almost certainly be enjoyed just as much by their adult companions).
B007TK77QE|2.0|To be honest I'm a little disappointed.  After the huge successes of her childrens books I may have been expecting too much?  I found it very slow to start and even at the halfway mark I was still waiting for it to \\"takeoff\\".  There were also a lot of different characters introduced very early on and I found it difficult to keep up with who's who's.  In saying all that, it hasnt put me off and I would try another of her books if she puts another out in the future.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Great, unconventional book. The narrative tricks are occasionally too cute by half (the review should really be 4 and one half stars) but it is both moving and a virtuoso authorial performance spanning historical fiction, science fiction, crime fiction and crazy post apocalyptic dialect out of Fiskadoro by Denis Johnson. Tough going at times (one section is intentionally written like a cheesy '70s detective novel, while another is in a futuristic argot), but really worthwhile.  Very different from the movie (which is fantastic as well) and really quite extraordinary.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I had no memory of the characters when I started this book....for awhile I thought maybe they had been secondary characters in the first book and this was now about them....I continued and enjoyed the book but when I told my daughter she said I think I am going to read the first one before reading the new one.....I thought good idea although I had finished the new one. I read the first one only to discover that the book was about the same characters lol and so I fins oohed the first gain and read the second again. Excellent and thoroughly enjoyed. Sometimes better then 50 Shades. Can't wait till the 3rd except I will more then likely read the first 2 again so I remember them well after reading other books between. I think I have also decided to read trilogies when they are all out for that reason.
0857685848|5.0|a really great hardcover coffeetable type book of spectacular paintings of dinosaurs. oh how i wish i had one of these at my disposal when i was a child, one wonders how life would have taken a different path. leave this one out in the living room and how people will take it up and go ohh and ahh!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The acting is outstanding, and it keeps making you wonder who you should like and dislike. Definitely worth the time and money.
0525953728|5.0|Once I started reading this book, it was hard to put down.  The story as told by Mark Owens is nothing short of incredible and captivating.  This book was such an easy read and one you don't want to walk away from.  Mark Owens does not waste time telling the world how great he is, but praises those that took part in this incredible mission.  I highly recommend this book to everyone as this was one of the most important events in the history of our country.  I made my junior high and high school aged kids read this as I felt it was that important.  They were not disappointed.
B0094KTCUQ|5.0|Makes me want to go back to Paris. Kids love it, wife loves it. We watch it all the time. The voice of evil food critic is voice of pope in the English show about Henry VIII
1250007305|3.0|Being in the IT field, I was excited to read this book, both for the subject matter and considering the Russinovich's accomplished experience in the field. Plus, I'm a sucker for a good thriller. Unfortunately, maybe my IT background was also what made it somewhat disappointing to me, with certain plot details and even writing styles being a bit annoying to me.<br /><br />One incredibly irritating example so divorced from reality that cropped up again and again was how everyone--EVERYONE--seems to be so sorely inconvenienced by their keyboards that they can't type a single word to completion when in IRC, forums or IMs. Granted, many abbreviations are used (and abused) today in text messages and IMs, but I have never seen it as ridiculous and ludicrous as Russinovich makes it, especially among professionals (who make up the main characters). One would think that Russinovich's knowledge of the field was limited to Hollywood's version of it and not reality!<br /><br />Another example is the various effects of the viruses, some of which are just inconceivable. On the one hand, most of the targeted computers just shut down and \\"die\\". But, then you have the bizarre ones (for plot effect, I suppose), such as the assembly line machines attacking a person. Twice.  And why most computers would \\"die\\" while an airplane's computer can somehow be rebooted successfully is another inconsistency.<br /><br />And that's to say nothing of the \\"blue screens\\" followed by the \\"black screens\\" with the Hollywood-style simplistic messages. (Why the simplicity with those messages, but the ridiculously technical text dumps of the assembly code in other parts of the book?)<br /><br />While I'm highlighting the negative aspects of this book, let me add one more: THE ENDING. Absolutely terrible. It was almost as though Russinovich just ran out of time or steam and just \\"hmmm, I'll just write a whole load of neat plot wrap-ups into a detailed memo from one character to another (deus ex machina style)\\". And that's to say nothing of the unsatisfying ending just prior to those wrap-ups. I was sorely disappointed and would have given the book 4 stars if it weren't for this severe disappointing ending plus lazy, copout wrap-up.<br /><br />Now the positives: it was fast-paced and exciting, and the characters--while not exactly exciting or really fleshed out--were adequate enough to support the exciting plot. The book won't win any literary awards, but that's the point: no flowery prose, no rambling tangents; just a page-turning, rapidly-moving plot that makes you want to read the whole thing in one sitting. And that was good enough to keep me entertained for almost all of it, and to get a solid 3 stars.
0439023513|4.0|As most of you probably know, Mockingjay is the third and final book in the Hunger Games trilogy. I reread The Hunger Games and Catching Fire fairly recently, so I wanted to finish the trilogy a second time. The first time around, I didn't like Mockingjay nearly as much; I thought it was too violent. It's grown on me though. The first time I read it, I was going through really fast, and didn't pay enough attention to Katniss's struggle and grief. It was really heartbreaking. The second half is still a little to violent for my tastes, but I definitely enjoyed it much more.<br /><br />Mockingjay begins basically where Catching Fire left off. Katniss, Gale, and Finnick are now at the District 13 rebel base. But Peeta is still in the hands of the Capitol. The story follows Katniss's transformation from a slightly deranged grief-stricken teenager to the Mockingjay, the symbol of the Rebellion, and back again. This is a good conclusion to the series.<br /><br />All of my reviews can be read at my blog (see my profile.)
B009329ZF2|3.0|Physics aside - why would an alien race attempt an invasion of Earth with only marginally superior technology and not in overwhelming force? Was hard to suspend disbelief enough for a higher rating.  Still, I did enjoy all the explosions.
B0095R64AO|1.0|Very juvenile piece of trash.  Written by 2nd graders with potty mouths and no imagination. I was very disappointed with this movie.
B000A2RRF4|3.0|The concert is good (well because it's MJ). But the quality of the product is not a good one. If you have a large tv screen, this won't fit. I'm not familiar but could it be a dvd limitation? I watched this in my 42\\" tv and the video but the left and right sides of the screen are black (more/less 2-3 inches).
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This book is lots of fun to read.  David Mitchell has created a puzzling series of stories, that gradually fit together beautifully.  You have to have faith and not give up when one story seems to stop in the middle of things and you are thrust into another world he has created.  His language and style suggest other great authors, but he puts his own twist to each one.  This is not a book where you are swept into another world and stay there for a while.  This one challenges you and makes you think.  A very good, and important work.
B00956UPSW|5.0|I can't give this album enough praise. Even though it is part 1 and is only a few tracks, each one is amazing.
030758836X|4.0|Dysfunctional couple - absolutely. Intriguing look at insanity played out inside a marriage in the most manipulating way. This novel is a wild ride with \\"amazing AMY\\" going to extreme lengths to punish her cheating husband-- she fakes her death and leaves evidence and clues to make her husband suspect #1 -- won't tell you more except this: read it.
B004SBX112|4.0|I don't play as much as i use to but this is a great game and it kept me coming back time and again.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The character development is outstanding. The story focuses on an English country village and the stress caused by country politics, class struggles, love, family, poverty, drugs, and life in general. The writing is delightful and this is the only thing the book has in common with Harry Potter. There is no fantasyland with clear good versus evil. I loved it, but I am a Jane Austen fan and I love stories that contain only three or four country families.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|if your ever wanting to just sit down and play a game this is the game to buy. its fun its free its fast and its easy.
B001HBX8NC|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this bluray.  I didn't think the production was especially good or bad, but I mainly care about the singing.  Nucci was fantastic, the old veteran, having sung this role many times, really fills it with life.  Elena Mosuc was wonderful as Gilda, especially on the very, very high notes, where she starts with a bell like pianissimo, and then expands to a much fuller sound.  She even took several bows after the Gualtier Malde aria, and Nucci did the same after Cortiggianmi.  Normally, I don't like this, but this time I felt it was fine.  They're divas, you know.  The audience ate it up.  Piotr Beczala has a strong, resonant tenor, with no problem or thinning on the high notes.  I also thought he acted very well.  Picture, sound and video direction were all top notch.  This disc is also quite inexpensive, a true bargain.
B004IM14RY|1.0|There, now you don't have to waste your 90 minutes to see if anything actually happens worth while.  He's trapped, he calls people and they can't help, there is a snake, and they don't find him in time.  He dies, so thankfully the movie can end.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Loved this book! I usually can guess the ending but this one had me trying to sort the good guys from the bad guys right up to the end. I am anxious to read more from this author. Don't miss this one it was well worth the price.
B004OZZ624|5.0|Movie was a little slow to start, had a few parts where the story did not really fit in, but overall a very engaging movie that keeps you in suspense for most of it.  Not a lot of action in case you hate bang em up movies, but enough to make it exciting.  Good acting and overall worth giving it a watch.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|This book must have been written by someone else. The story lines jump around, and are confusing. It is wordy and downright boring at times. This cannot be the same author of \\" Pillars of the Earth \\" which I loved,
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Haven't played a hidden object game in a long time and thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Think. I'm hooked again.  Can't wait for the sequel.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not as good as I was expecting, you would think with such an all star cast it would have been better.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|I loved the first book in this series and was looking forward to this book. Sadly I was disappointed! Reflected in You just didn't have the same racy pace as the first book. I found it short, predictable and boring. I will still read the third book when it comes out hoping for a return to a page-turning story line and something a little more tantalising.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|i am addicted to swapping games but graphics on this game are great. Got yhe game as free game of the day awhile ago and just started playing. Can easily spend 30 minutes playing without thinking..
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Looking forward to Book 3 of the Century Trilogy.  Loved the descriptions and personal stories of the characters.  It's refreshing to read modern novels that are not reliant upon sex to tell a story.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Wow! Also if you are on the frame select, if you scroll all the way down, you'll find the Quell Reflect frame select. I was surprised about that. Try it!
B007T99ENE|5.0|Once again Ian McEwen delivers a great read developing realistic characters with the many foibles so many of us have.  He has masterfully developed the story all the way through to a satisfying conclusion.  I can't wait for his next book!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun but it takes alot of time and there isn't any way to earn money so u have to use real money which adds up fast.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Another in the seemingly countless number of mindless action-adventure movies released each year. For a mindless action-adventure movie it is one of the better ones. It is unique in its mindlessness in that there are several shallow characters rather than one or two. The action-adventure is unique in that the weapons are not just the same as the weapons in the others of this ilk, the weapons are sometimes super powers. That is pretty much it.
B001NTUAFC|5.0|This is like the best of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden!! It's one of those albums that rocks from beginning to end.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I like the kindle version so much that I ordered the book version for my daughter who is another dog lover.  If that is the criteria, I suppose I should order one for everyone in my family.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book should be required reading for all high school students and policy makers. The author clearly and powerfully outlines the history of our relationship with cancer.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Can't put this book down.  Pages fly by.  Highly recommend this book. I'm looking forward to the next two books in the saga.
B007THA4FI|2.0|In my opinion, Ms. Rowling should have stuck with children's literature.<br /><br />I found Casual Vacancy leaving me with an empty (vacant, as it were,) feeling.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|An average \\"read\\"; not exceptional in any way.  This book should be, with any luck, the end of the saga.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Reading this book was a littl e disappointing after reading the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. Characters and storyline not as well developed
0425263908|3.0|If you've read Fifty Shades then you've read this book.  It's a similar version with the characters names changed.  Christian is Gideon, Ana is Eva.  Both Christian and Gideon are self made billionaires before the age of 30 who fall in love with newly graduated women.  Day stole so much from the Fifty Shades series.  I found myself reading on, hoping things would be different but I kept getting more of the same. Day didn't make much a leap in how the men dominated women, left out Christian's fetishes and that's about it.  Young inexperienced women, domineering men.  Both men fall in love and can't live without their women who have miraculously changed their lives.  The books are more alike than different and I found that too predictable. If I hadn't already bought the sequel \\"Reflected in You\\" when I purchased \\"Barred to You\\", I wouldn't bother. I can guess how it ends if it continues to follow the same plot as the \\"Fifty Shades\\" series. I read a review that said this book was better written.  I didn't get that,  she didn't use much imagination to move away for an already popular book trilogy.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was addictive.  I enjoyed it very much. The graphics were also very well done.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes mysteries along with seek and find games.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I've been a huge Megadeth fan since Killing is My Business first came out in the mid 80's and this book didn't disappoint at all. I had heard a few of the more famous stories through interviews and such but that didn't take anything away from the book at all. Hearing everything from Dave's point of view was eye opening. Especially the part he played in Metallica's \\"Some Kind Of Monster\\". I've always wondered how Dave felt about the scene in that movie that he is a part of and he totally addresses it in this book. I could go on and on about all of the cool things he talks about but suffice to say that if you are a Megadeth fan........ buy this book!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|lots of full but not sure of all the rules<br />relaxing and takes very little thought which is good when one is tired after working all day
B003KK6GOQ|3.0|I found the format eg written as letters back & forth unusual & difficult to follow<br /><br />It wasnt as amusing to me as I was lead to believe it was
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This movie isn't award-winning, but it's entertaining and a good flick for popcorn and a movie on the couch. I recommend it for an evening when you don't want to do a lot of thinking!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I really loved this movie! It tries to give us some hope that there is always a chance, at any age, to find love, happiness, or whatever it is that you may be looking for, in the most unlikely of places. I would definitely recommend this most enjoyable and beautiful film. It was absolutely refreshing and sincerely wonderful! Filled with color and laughter, this movie far out did my expectations.
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|It was a beautiful movie and an amazing story. The actors carried it, it was a refreshing change to the typical movie fare.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|i'm pretty technical, but it isn't obvious to me what is where.  perhaps the problem is specific to my kinle fire hd platform.  for example, i cannot find an easy way to get to the picture gallery after i take a picture.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a challenging read for elementary students. Middle and high schoolers will have an easier time with this text. The chapters are each written from a different characters view point. It is an excellent venue to explore bullying and getting in the shoes of the character. The characters are sensitively portrayed. Students will really connect with each of them.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down just like the first one. I can't wait for the third book. Waiting til Dec 31 will be hard.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I Love my copy of \\"Live At The Troubadour.\\" I have always been a big fan of James Taylor.  To listen to him and Carole King, takes me back to a simplier time.  The song selection is great and the music is awesome.  I really got a great product at a great price.  The DVD is very good also.  I enjoy watching it.  Everyone seems as though they were having a good time.
6300181286|5.0|This video Frankenstein is in Black & White has the introduction I wanted and the movie on VHS-VCR format .Really intense plot Mary Shelly is author of the original book this movie was made after.1992 is the year release I wanted.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Some authors can't pull off a short story that is affecting and memorable.  Connelly does it x 3.  Fans of irony will enjoy.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|love the movie. counted days down until it came to dvd, and then bought it the day it came out. the music is amazing,i  listen to it all the timke. in fact im listening to harden my heart right now!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great continuation of the story and characters.  I'm looking forward to #3.  I always enjoy reading any of Ken Follett books.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|You read to find hidden gems like this page turner with a message that holds you from start to finish.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|This was a great season of Doctor Who!  Lots of fun and mystery and excitement!  It just gets better every year.  It's a show my daughters love as much as I do....if not more!
B006ICOK00|1.0|One phrase for potential buyers:  Don't buy this product.  It is cheaply built and WAY too expensive for what you get.  Don't be fooled by thinking that his unit is better than their other version because it has a view finder.  The view finder is small, fuzzy and can't handle motion.  The casing is flimsy, not weather proof and the covering for the memory card doesn't shut all the way once opened.  The movie quality is terrible.  Do yourself a favor and download an iPhone app that does the same thing for 1/200th the cost.  This is a very cool idea and if the product was, say...$29.95 it might be worth it.  Don't be fooled and don't waste your time with the Brinno.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Enjoyed the book. I especially enjoyed how the story is coming together. Would have been better if it was written just a little more on the adult side. But anyhow a great read as usuall from the author.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I've read and re-read TaiPan, many times, but had never tried Shogun until a friend recommended it.  I was hooked by the end of page 1.  The complexity of the sentences and the details used in describing the settings allow the reader to be 'inside' the book with the characters.  I can't wait to finish it!!
B0083GCK5G|4.0|I found this album quite enjoyable, and have listened several times. It brings back memories, but it does not require one to be a Beach Boys fan from the past to appreciate the music. I am glad I ordered it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is one of my favorite games! I play it even when I watch TV. Brings me fast relief from a stressed day! I highly recommend it to all!
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I like almost all the songs on this CD.  I like Aim and Ignite slightly better though.  The highs on this CD are better, and I don't wanna say the lows were worse, they just aren't as interesting.  Overall I think this is a really good CD and anybody would enjoy a majority of it.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|I've watched this film a dozen times before. Great acting, great writing, great imagery. I can never watch the ending though, because it's just too sad for me.
B007PVHANM|5.0|A very in depth and interesting documentary about Bob Marley, his music, and the politics that surrounded it. Watched it three times in the first week after I bought it. The commentary was also very good. If you like B. Marley you will love this DVD.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|This movie was absolutely terrible, I couldn't get through the first half hour. Such bad writing and cheesy dialogue and characters.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I assumed with Johnny Depp that this would be much better than it was but it was rather bla to me.  I did enjoy it but it was a small letdown.
B0011BGY66|5.0|I heard a few songs from Vampire Weekend through Pandora and decided to purchase an album. This one is great! Love it :)
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! A great follow up to book 1 - can't wait to read the third installment
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn does it again.  She is such an amazing writer and \\"Dark Places\\" is a must read.  I couldn't put it down. I love how you go from thinking you can figure it out to no idea who is doing what.  I appreciate the fact that she takes great lengths to ensure you know all characters involved.  Please Read!!!
0345803485|1.0|Who are the mommies of this so-called \\"mommy porn\\" craze, and have any of these women ever read a real book before?  Because this is the most preposterous \\"book\\" I've ever read in my life.  The regular story is lame, the erotic scenes are laughable and unbelievable, the characters are cookie-cutter and one-dimensional and uninteresting, and the whole thing is so, soooo badly written I could barely even get through it.  I might have given myself a headache from rolling my eyes so much.  Did people forget that there is erotic fiction all over the internet, for free?  How did THIS become a thing, especially when you have to pay for it?  (Thankfully, I did not.)  Ladies (and gentlemen, if you're out there), if you want to read a cheap \\"romance\\" story with nothing but constant dirty scenes, no plot and no point, go to an erotic literature website or fan fiction website.  Those stories, scarily enough, are actually better than this one.  But, on the bright side, this book gives me hope for my future as a writer.  Clearly, people will read anything.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|For people who love old-fashioned novels with plots, complicated characters, and a basis in history, The Fall of Giants and Winter of the World are wonderful. Can't wait for the promised third volume in the history. Lots of details from daily life before and during WWII combined with behind-the-scenes political machinations really make for a satisfying read. Highly recommended.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|I bought this bag as a gift to my boyfriend as he was starting school. He likes his \\"electronic\\" gadgets so he was very happy to fit his 17\\" mac, ipad, notebooks, bose headphones in the bag. I have not seen it yet but he was very happy with the sturdiness of the bag. In my opinion, the backpack delivered more than its value!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Always curious about Nikki because he was always my \\"fave\\" person in Motley Crue.  So much that he wrote in this, his \\"Heroin Diaries\\" coincides with what I've written, or thought.  I never gave in to drugs or drink but I felt like he felt.  I knew, that if I ever did give in, I would have lived a lost life, if I lived at all.

B000ICZD5M|1.0|(This review contains spoilers). This is not a very good movie. It has its moments, but mostly it is too long & laughably shallow. I loved the novel, Dune, by Frank Herbert. I highly recommend that book. This movie does not in the least do the story justice. The book is full of political intrigue, religious manipulation, and the journey to manhood of a young boy with mental and physical abilities the next step up the evolutionary ladder. The story of the Fremen is fascinating, how they cling to their religion & each other with fierce strength and adaptability in this harsh desert climate. The movie misses all these points spectacularly. The movie takes great liberties both with the story line and physical presentation of the characters, mostly for shock value. The mother, a strong and immensely important character in the book, is reduced in the movie to a sniveling side role in the movie. Most exasperating! The ending \\"water\\" miracle is a complete fabrication, and misses the point entirely by attributing the planets rejuvenation to a Messiah rather than to the hard work and patience of the Fremen people following Kynes' brilliant plans. I really wanted to like this movie. Instead, now I feel like I need to go back and re-read the book to cleanse its horror from my mind!

B0045HCJGC|5.0|I'd forgotten how good this film is. Sure it's a cop action movie but it is genuinely a Sci Fi movie as well. It's claimed one of the definitions of science fiction is that somehow the events taking place effect all of us, everyone on Earth. It's a menace, a disease, a threat, that can kill us all or at least have major consequences. Perhaps this film explores an ideology that threatens us all. . . more correctly this film explores another definition Sci Fi, some kind of change to society. This isn't a children's story or action movie that happens to take place in space or in the future, with people exactly like us. In Demolition Man the population of San Angeles believe and act in completely different ways than we do. Demolition Man stresses how differently they behave.<br /><br />In 2032 it appears there's no crime, no violence, and no foul language or littering. We don't see those who rebel against this conditioning until late in the movie. At one point in the film Sandra Bullock and her cop partner listen to the radio - the only thing airing are commercials. They happily sing along to the advertising jingles. For the most part, however, the film makers stack the deck by making this look like a better world than the one we live in. This is some kind of 'conservative' movie, I think.<br /><br />It seems like they took care not to stereotype the villain, Simon Phoenix. He's like a fay, happy, psychopath. He makes no pretenses to be macho, that's for sure. Simon Phoenix takes not caring to a new level. Most likely a coincidence but Wesley Snipes channels a bit of the Joker from the old Batman TV show.<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone plays the cop John Spartan but anyone could have played him. I think the villain in the film had to be a black actor. Later in the film the mayor of San Angeles tells Simon Phoenix, \\"People are scared of you\\". Simon Phoenix replies, as if he's hardly paying attention - and sounding a bit like the character Elmo from the Muppets, \\"eh people have always been scared of me\\", The mayor replies with emphasis, \\"Yes but now they are really terrified of you\\", \\"Now we can create a society with order the likes of which has never been seen\\". When do they just come out and tell you their evil plan? Outside a Hulu commercial, when does power speak truth - when do they come out and just tell you their plan right in your face?<br /><br />I'd reviewed this before on another site and noted this part of the film is odd in a way. In a society where there's no crime - when a call comes in for 187, the famous call number for murder, no one on the police force even knows what it means - in a society where there's no crime, littering or even foul language, why would they need to restore order? The actor who plays the police chief for San Angeles steps out of character a bit. He plays a tough guy almost. He still doesn't know what the police code 187 stands for but he sort of becomes the cliche of the police chief who tangles with the top cop who's the star of the movie.<br /><br />I felt this was a good film and did a good job showing citizens of San Angeles acting quite a bit different than we do. They kept repeating the same kind of joke over and over in the film, however. The first couple of times it was very funny. After a while it stopped being funny.have always been scared of me\\", The mayor replies with emphasis, \\"Yes but now they are really terrified of you\\", \\"Now we can create a society with order the likes of which has never been seen\\".

B001CHXUPC|5.0|I purchased this item for my 8-year old grandson's Birthday.  He's been researching it with his dad and was very excited when he asked me for it.  The size was much bigger than I anticipated so I am very happy with that and he was too!  I'm sure he will enjoy many hours of play with his model.  Thank you again for your dependable assistance.
B00028HBKC|4.0|Usually I doubt the historical accuracy of these kinds of films but I'll take it on faith The Passion of Christ is more or less Historically accurate. I had heard some of the buzz and knew this film was directed by 'Mel Gibson' but it wasn't what I expected. Wasn't prepared for the utter sadism of the prison guards. And the naked glee the people felt each time the condemned were lashed.<br /><br />It was time for a change. As it is again.
B0030M3SBI|5.0|This CD is a must for all Henrix fans he is just majical making a guitar speak and sing...put on my head phones and leave me alone
B005DNO7MQ|3.0|Russel Crowe channels a bit of the actor Mel Gibson. The Gibson of Braveheart and The Patriot. I see those two movies are advertised as similar choices on Gladiator's Amazon page. Perhaps it's Crowe's natural charisma and he even has to restrain himself at times, or at least doesn't have to act too hard.<br /><br />Gladiator is a friend of mine's favorite movie. My friend is a male model and studying acting, so I value his opinion. Actually, I value it more because he's a friend. I see this film won the Academy award. None of this convinces me this is a great movie. Well, great, of course by the judgement of consensus, and the experts, but it just didn't interest me that much. Perhaps I shared just a little too much of Crowe's nonchalant attitude. . . I just didn't care that much. Perhaps the subtlety is what I Should have liked. Perhaps that made it more personal and less about empire.<br /><br />It just wasn't that entertaining for me. I'm not glad I watched it - I'm not a better person now - lol. I don't think.<br /><br />I did look up Commodus and Maximus on Google. I wonder if Commodus, the villain in the film, was actually a great man.
B007V65R54|4.0|Excellent very smart and thoughtful. It became a bit of a morass in the section on the weather, but it became an wonderful new way to view the world and all the pundits in it.  The man is clearly a \\"superstar\\" already. Michael Rakosi

B0098VYKSA|1.0|Truly, my fellow movie enthusiast, this movie was a miserable disappointment.<br /><br />I honestly didn't have sky high expectations for this movie, so it wasn't a case of having them being too high to possibly be met (as can often be the case for fantasy/epic/action movies).  The first 20 minutes or so were compelling--I was intrigued, as were the people that were watching it with me [Note, I have only good things to say about the streaming quality--as always with Amazon it's great].<br /><br />After the first 20 minutes it just seems like the story collapsed on itself under the weight of trying to \\"reimagine\\" the Snow White story.  There was very little meaningful chemistry between the actors, and after a while, the CG looked like it would have been decent for a mid-90's film.  All in all it ended up being enjoyable, but more because I and my friends were laughing at it.  So, it wasn't a total loss.<br /><br />But, if you are looking for something that is epic and compelling, I highly recommend you go look elsewhere
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not typically a science fiction fan, but this was a gripping read.  If you are looking for books that will help your kids develop a social consciousness, this is a great book!
B008CPBB0I|4.0|Want some entertainment that isn't salacious and violent? This movie is just the ticket. It has a basis in fact, which adds an educational dimension.  If you lived through the puzzling cold war antics of the 1980s, this movie will remind you of that era's political dynamic-- interesting perspective!  Watch the movie, you'll enjoy it.
B001AVCFJM|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but it is so boneheaded that I find that impossible.<br /><br />Say what you will about the old Star Trek universe, but it did try to play by certain rules. It attempted to be credible for the situations and histories that were portrayed. It tried to be consistent. This newest Star Trek movie, however, reeks of a bunch of beered-up teenagers shouting at each other: \\"Wouldn't this be fun?\\" \\"Wouldn't this be cool, dude?\\" \\"Screw the old geezers who like that old boring stuff.\\"<br /><br />I'll just pick out five things that drove me batty and ruined the flick for me.<br /><br />First, the Romulan villain's ship. It's like a thousand times bigger (by weight) than the Enterprise and it's made up of all these pointy, sharp, curvy, scary things. Like a big bouquet of humongeous swords and sabers. It's supposedly a former mining ship. The problems? For a start, building the thing would have cost the annual gross economic product of the Romulan Empire. How does its design have anything to do with mining? What practical reason is there for it to be so huge? How does it happen to be the most fearsome warship in the galaxy? Well, J.J. Abrams and friends (whose Fringe I adore) made it this way not because it lends any credibility to the story, but because it was simply too gosh-darned cool to not make it look like this. That is really crappy story-telling.<br /><br />Second, the brand new Enterprise, the biggest baddest ship in the Federation fleet, flies blind right into a huge battle debris field in its first action. No way could a ship this big have not been destroyed entering such an area jam-packed with giant shrapnel. Again, incredible and stupid.<br /><br />Third, in this film we kill off most of the Vulcans and Romulans who are living. Billions of them. So how does that work for the future of the Star Trek universe?<br /><br />Fourth, what in heck is \\"red matter\\" and how does it make black holes? At least throw out some pseudo-physics there, guys.<br /><br />Finally, the Enterprise roars off with apparently only one senior officer on the bridge--Capt. Pike. Everyone else is a recent academy graduate. What military organization--or quasi-military organization--would have allowed such a thing to happen, even in an emergency? Again, literally incredible (as in not even remotely believable). And then Pike, only senior officer around, goes off to be a hostage while Spock (recent academy grad) takes the helm.<br /><br />I really would have liked to see a good Kirk and Spock origin story, but this isn't it. This flick simply breaks faith with the Star Trek universe. I know it was a success at the box office and a sequel's been made. But oy, this movie drives me right up the wall.here, guys.<br /><br />Finally, the Enterprise roars off with apparently only one senior officer on the bridge--Capt. Pike.

B0098VXBIA|4.0|Even though I am WELL BEYOND my childbearing years, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It brought me back to my own time of being pregnant and had both humorous and endearing moments of that time in life. Cameron Diaz was at her always adorable best and the same for Jennifer Lopez. Anyone who is or has been preggers had the book WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU ARE EXPECTING on the night table and will definitely get a kick out of this movie!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|If you want a slow moving love story, this movie is not it. It is crammed full of action from the very start. Meet all of the Avengers. More super hero's in a two hour film than candy corn at Halloween. Excellent Movie. Did I mention it was action packed? WOW!
B007SNMYNS|1.0|I did not read the entire book. After getting into it I found this way of eating does not suit me or my family. The recipes were unrealistic for hard working people and would not satisfy.
B003YUC2FE|2.0|I just got a bad surprise when I realized that none of the DVDs of this Amazing Box set, were dubbed and no subs were included. It's a little expensive for not to have them included. I just got a blu ray player on my living room, and my 2 years old little daughter wanted to watch the film on the bedroom, in wish I only have a dvd player, the DVDs on the box are only in English. She cant understand anything of english yet.<br />What a pity.
0399157565|5.0|I was grabbed by this book from the beginning.  I couldn't wait for Kay to get down to the Boston Harbor where a huge Leatherback Turtle is fighting for his life weighed down by by heavy weights that are pulling him under and keeping him from breathing.  I kept thinking, \\"Go on Kay! Get down there\\" Go!\\",but she had to follow all of the proper procedures so that some bureaucrat in the future couldn't invalidate her testimony on a technicality. The kind prehistoric Turtle is juxtaposed with evidence of a cruel and sadistic nature - the body of a woman is attached in a booby trapped fashion and the utmost care must be taken to extricate the Turtle and the woman.<br /><br />An archaeologist has gone missing in Canada, and the wife of a wealthy man has disappeared and soon they find out who the woman in the water is.  Are all of these cases related?  Is it the work of a \\"Narcissistic sociopath.  Someone who mocks.\\", in Benton's words. There is also the death of a 42 year old black male who is reported as having been caused by falling down the stairs, but the evidence proves to Kay that it was much more violent than that of a fall.<br /><br />I loved the flirting with the pilot of the boat taking them to the scene - Giorgio Labella who \\"looks like an Armani model\\" . \\"I feel his dark eyes glancing at me as I talk.  I feel them on the back of my neck as if a warm tongue has touched me there.\\"  This is a fun book and it is complicated and so original. Kay figures it all out and she still \\"has it\\" in more ways than one.
B008SVFX96|5.0|Okay, I admit I am biased when it comes to Richie Sambora, but I feel he is a great, great guitarist and lyricist.

B007U8UBGI|5.0|This is a great Jack White album. I love the addition of multiple instruments and musical styles. I enjoy most of the songs and can easily listen to it frequently without getting tired of it. I also saw him last month in concert(for the first time!) and it was an immensely enjoyable experience. I like sometimes quirky musical styles and Jack can be wonderfully quirky without being really oddball.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was just okay and was probably my least favourite of the three. You have to read it after Catching Fire since that book leaves so much unfinished but there are parts where the book drags. I like that the \\"good guys\\" - the Rebels - have some complexity; they're not all good to the Capitol's evil. I also liked the strength of the female characters in this book. I didn't like how Katniss was written in this one. I found her inner dialogue to be so self-pitying that it was almost irritating and it did little to further the plot of the book.
B007HJB55G|5.0|The movies are well made. Actors very realistic. The movies follow close to the books, although some of the details are missing, the story line follows exactly.
1592402038|4.0|While a little dry at times (the author's British though, so that is to be expected) overall this was a fun enjoyable grammar and punctuation refresher.  I will also warn that because the author is British there are a few instances in the book itself where the punctuation seems off.  For example, the quotation marks are inside ending punctuation.  This is how it is done in England, so don't be surprised when that is how it looks.
1577314808|5.0|At first I didn't want to read it because it is pop-culture, Oprah, etc. I like to read hardcore analytic stuff, that makes my brain work (and I still like intensely intellectual stuff, and in fact I even like it the more as I am able to take my consciousness beyond that the thinking plane).<br /><br />I see, good point. The book is more of a manual for meditation rather than a study of specific materials. It addressed and untangled some common knots or unconscious misconceptions I had in my mind which inhibited a fuller understanding, enjoyment and vision of life. Certain intuitive ideas or \\"techniques\\" of being, such as the practice of mindfulness, were discussed; Zen, Biblical stories were referenced in a meaningful way to illustrate the \\"universality\\" of an idea, and thus making a simple sketch of the topography of the psyche in the surrounding cosmos, just rough enough to show you the way to the exit, which is a typical central motif in Buddhist and Hindu traditions. Exit from what, the Matrix? From the thinking mind's labyrinth and or from the ego, but it's not even an exit (and not even a labyrinth), but a lifting of the ceiling onto another dimension of consciousness in addition to the mind. Emphasis is made away from the egocentric mode of being (or function), which amounts to a broader range of experience. Illusion exists in the form of emphasis on the extramundane, which may make a big impression on the reader, and the consequent negation of the \\"domestic\\". An audio reading while walking in a park relaxing resulted in my temporary elation which neither completely stayed nor completely went away, but after the elation the ego as it often happens \\"remembers itself\\" and tries to assert itself and at the same time to keep it going or anyway somehow meddle with it, which is the opposite of the sought-after `liberation\\", which is very obvious in Buddhism and Hinduism. The book shows how great the liberated state is but fails to tell you that history shows thatpeople who pursue liberation often have to practice for many years, which isn't always easy (especially it should hardly be expected to be easy for a Western man with all that mythology). In fact the book specifically insists that it IS easy and it is correct but still in practice people get hang-ups and stuff. But the book was more than just inspiring, I found it helpful as a supplement to my knowledge. Further my reading took me to read about meditative traditions from a western psychoanalytic viewpoint to compare and contrast these ideas. Still, this book wasn't about ideas, it was more like a recap and a meditation aid. Nothing strikingly new here to someone accustomed to these kinds of ideas, but an enjoyable and neutral introduction anyway.

B00887490Y|5.0|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />\\"The Tall Man\\" has all the appearances of a standard urban legend abduction/murder thriller, but it turns out to be deeper and more challenging than anything in that genre could ever be. Just when it seems to let you down by unraveling too quickly, a new thread emerges, and the surprises continue right up to the very end. No, it doesn't answer all the questions for you, but there is a very solid plot-line here, and it leaves just enough to the imagination. \\"The Tall Man\\"'s biggest weakness is probably that it's just too hurried: As always, it's understandable why the creators wanted to keep the length within certain limits, but this is one film that I wouldn't mind watching for another hour or so.<br /><br />Outstanding scenery and sense of place, believable dialogue, and a lot of really good acting--Jodelle Ferland and young Jakob Davies give especially strong performances. There is also a meaningful commentary on our times (regarding the economy and certain other aspects)embedded within \\"The Tall Man.\\"

0802473156|5.0|I really enjoyed the Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman.  The book provides great insights into how people communicate and feel love for one another.  It was really cool to look and see what my and my girlfriend's \\"love languages\\" were.  It made a huge impact on our relationship and the way we relate!  I have been finding new and creative ways to express myself, which I never would have considered before reading this book.<br /><br />Another book that had a great impact on my life and relationship is Ariel and Shya Kane's [[ASIN:1888043024 How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage]].  It is an inspiring book, which can support you in having an amazing relationship.  It includes video clips of the Kanes interacting with the people discussed in the book, which was really helpful, as I could see the ideas expressed in the book come to life.  I highly recommend both the Five Love Languages and How To Have A Match Made In Heaven if you are interested in the possibility of having an extraordinary relationship.
034580404X|5.0|50 shades is a modern day love story.  Most people go right to the kinky stuff when they refer to the book.  It is so much more than that. I have read 2 of them and starting the third.  I am enjoying it so much I'm delaying the finish of the 3rd book to keep the story alive in my mind.  How's that for a great book, coming from someone who only in recent years began reading fiction?  Read it for yourself and for your relationship, you will learn just how open and intimate your partner is willing to be and where your soft and hard limits are physically and emotionally and be glad you did.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|I must admit that I'm a flashlight junkie. I've owned many brands and this is the best flashlight I've ever owned. On the highest power, the batteries don't last long, but you rarely need the highest power. I use it to irrigate with. On the highest power, I can see if the water is out to the end of 1/4 mile rows. It seems to be durable, although I've been really careful with it. The only thing I don't like is the placement of the two switches. With gloves on, in the winter, it seems that I always hit the power level switch instead of the on off switch. At over 700 lumens, it's the most flashlight you can get for the money. I'm planning on buying 4 more for christmas for my son and inlaws.<br /><br />It is pricey, but it's well worth the price! If you want a really bright, rugged flashlight, this is the one to get!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|All the movies that build up to this film made this film awesome.  We already had background on the characters so we knew them all, so it just interesting to see them together and how they'd interact with each other and work together.  It was a fun, action-adventure film.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Simple and engaging. The &quot;buy more coins&quot; feature is scary, but if you're out of coins, just take a break and you'll get one every 30 seconds.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is a mix of awesome and amazing and I always did like the pigs better this game is awesome
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Solid, large-numbered calculator that performs your basic everyday math calculations. Works as advertised. Swift and easy. Performs all basic math functions. Perhaps it can incorporate fractions.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|the effects are really good. Charlize Theron is beautiful and great as the queen. A really good movie which is worth watching
B003PBB4ME|1.0|The hotshoe mount broke, the leg broke, and the handle itself broke. I take care of all of my stuff and i can not think of anyway this could have broken except that it is cheaply built.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Pleasant enough but it left me feeling ambivalent about the characters.  They were just too cliche to garner much interest in their trials and tribulatiions.  And honestly, it's hard to imagine anyone trading their very calm, even boring existance at retirement, age for the chaotic habitat in India unless they were forced to.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I gave a 1 star for attention really a 5 star but they need to change the price to 99&cent;.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you enjoyed Hunger Games, you really can't help but read the rest.  This 2nd in the series starts off a bit slowly but then \\"catches fire\\" and you won't want to put it down.  Yes, the target audience is young adult but I'm well past that and loved all three of the books.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Got this app for the grandkids.  They have spent time on rainy days enjoying being creative..They are 6 & 8 years old
B000W93CHC|2.0|Poorly written historically based (not sure if accurate) novel that is not nearly as good as the first in the series. It drags with too many architectural details. Early foreshadowing is a let down when once revealed. Lacks engaging dramatic elements.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Even better than the 1st......can't it for the third. Eva and Gideon make a great story of two abused people without havind to go into greatdepths you can understand where they are coming  from.
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|Nice romance to get yourself away!! Interesting courtship for such a strong woman. Follow up with the movie Mrs. Brown....Victoria in her later years.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love these books more than 50 shades! Would redomend to anyone whole liked 50 shades to read the crossfire trillogy it is much better!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app! It does have some minor glitches but for the most part it works fantastic. So glad I can use this on my kindle instead of a computer all the time
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. it hasn't glitched on me at all. it is a lot more fun than regular solitare.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I LOVED the Fifty Shades of Gray books!<br />Only wish they didnt stop at three lol (:<br />Did'nt care much for book one, but two and three were GREAT, and I've always hated reading and I couldn't put the books down! (:
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Like the other glowing reviews, I believe this is a worthy and remarkable second effort by the Brit folk band that blew my mind with their first album, Sigh No More. I purchased the deluxe version and am glad I did, the bonus tracks Where are you now and For those below are great, even The boxer cover was a pleasure. There are rousing anthems with the wall of acoustic guitar sound with Marcus Mumford's relentless strumming,  as on SNM, (Babel and I will wait, Not with haste, Whispers in the Dark) and the swelling of the harmonies of the band's voices together still come across in many songs, incl. Hopeless Wanderer and Where are you now. There isn't a bad let-down or filler song among these.<br /><br />The difference I notice is that there are more contemplative tracks, with even simpler instrumentation. They are less anthemic and more personal with very evocative lyrics (Below my feet, For those below, Ghosts that we knew, Holland Road). I will say the tempo of these songs feel leisurely, but never slow or dull. I'm glad the band is evolving. Artists need to stretch.<br /><br />I appreciate the change in mood and the greater intimacy of these songs. I can appreciate Mumford's voice and their harmonies all the more. The songs still offer fresh lyrics, few cliches and some breathtaking word pictures/stories.
B00846REIS|3.0|Not bad kinda hard to get into.<br />And after reading and looking for a new read, it does not come close to Fifty Shades of Gray.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read every Jack Reacher that Mr. Child has written.  A single character series of books often becomes stale.  Mr. Child has once again written a book that is true to the Reacher character, but has a fresh and interesting plot.  I eagerly look forward to the next Reacher novel.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest in general, so I was bound to love this app. no complaints from this chica!! I'm on it everyday.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. its aa very fun app that keeps toy occupied. very good for vay cays! !! defiently skemhing worth getting
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought the pink case for my Kindle and I love it! It just snaps in and I love how there is a cover to cover the screen when your not using it. I also really liked how you could stand it up sideways to watch movies or whatever rather than holding it. This is a really great product!
1439152802|5.0|I give a challenge to any reader.  I challenge you to be able to pick up this book and have the will power to put it down and walk away.  You will NOT be able to do that.  This book is the quintessential page turner.  High praise to Kate Morton for manipulation of character and time in such a clear, precise manner.  I won't talk about plot, I don't do that in any review, one can get that from the book's blurb.  This is now one of my favorite books and I'm sure I'll read it many more times.  Also, coming from a family with secrets, this book brought out a lot of issues for me.  The biggest question is:  just who was your mother, what was her life, before she became 'ma'. THANK YOU KATE MORTON!!!
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|this game blows after I won one race it said please buy the full version. everything is locked you only can do one race without it saying you have to buy the freaking app
B009GEPPYC|1.0|Hands down the WORST movie I have ever seen.  So ridiculous.  Horrible. Even if I wanted something that was a little goofy/ light-hearted, this is absurd. It just dumbfounds me that so many \\"stars\\" would participate in this, but I guess everyone has their price.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I would say it is an ok app.It is a little confusing. I think I will just stick to angry birds.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is just cool! The poor lil fluffballs get robbed and you have to save them. Then they bust out with beimg an Angry self artillary mercenary birds! 5 all the way, buy the full!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I love this album, just as much as their first. I would absolutely suggest it to anyone who loves good music.
B008B3H4VQ|4.0|I'd been planning on writing a review for this LP album for some time, and now it seems as though my thunder's been somewhat stolen.  In a good way.  I concur with just about everything JCStreetSoldier has had to say regarding Living Things (not to mention what has been said about Linkin Park's evolution/maturation over the years).  I'll touch on a few things he mentioned or missed, and reference a few things the \\"haters\\" have said, too.  Then my own play-by-play of the tracks.<br />Same as JCSS, I have been a huge fan of these guys.  Not quite as long - my first exposure to them was with One Step Closer's release as a single, and I was completely hooked when Crawling came out.  Their second album, Meteora, is my favorite of theirs.  When Minutes to Midnight came out, I was somewhat thrown for a loop, as Meteora seemed more of a polishing of the nu-metal sound they were perfecting with their first album.  But MtM was showing that they were trying to break free of the borders hardcore nu-metal fans were setting up for them, a taste of things to come for when their fourth (A Thousand Suns) and fifth (Living Things) albums would come out.  And like JCSS, although I love Meteora, these three albums most recent are still fantastic.<br />The thing I'm confused by (and it could be just the radio stations in my area) is the concept that Linkin Park has gone \\"mainstream\\" or \\"sold out.\\"  I'm confused by this statement because, in all honesty, the singles from these two latter albums have been played far less often than singles from their first two.  So, by that logic, it'd seem those first two albums - the ones that \\"stayed true to their sound\\" are the \\"mainstream\\" ones.  Perhaps the \\"haters\\" are really just hating themselves for subconsciously liking that which is liked by moms and 15-year-olds alike.<br />Now for the tracks:<br />Lost in the Echo.<br />I purposely didn't sample any of the songs before buying the album, so when this first track played, I was pretty impressed.  Very good blending of all that makes Linkin Park great.  Unlike JCSS, I don't mind when the band uses elements from their earlier days; nu-metal still has elements that can be implemented into a song to make it sonically pleasing without sounding played-out, and that's what they've accomplished with this track.  Speaking of played-out, though.  The only misgiving I give this track is that, because it's now a single, I've been hearing it on the radio more than I heard Burn it Down, and am worried it may lose its power as I hear it over and over.  8/10<br />In My Remains.<br />Great intro.  This is another LP song that would have worked well in the Transformers movies.  And been a good distraction from the disappointment that the films' actual content spewed forth.  8/10<br />Burn it Down.<br />After hearing the other tracks, I'm surprised this was the first single.  Lost in the Echo implemented more of Mike's rapping, which for the lapsed LP fans, I think might have drawn them back into the fold better than this one.  Not to say this is a bad song.  Not by a long shot.  The only other drawback this track has, in my opinion, is its placement on the album; it has a very similar sound/tempo to In My Remains - I often transpose the lyrics from IMR onto this one.  Something they might have been able to avoid had they put a little more time into this album as a whole.  8/10<br />Lies Greed Misery.<br />The anger has returned.  It's a very good driving song, probably good for working out to, as well.  7/10<br />I'll Be Gone.<br />I always forget about this song when I play the album from the beginning.  I don't know why, `cause I really like this song, despite Mike's absence from it.  Like a more productive, less mopey, version of My December.  9/10<br />Castle of Glass.<br />Holy crap.  I was floored when I first heard this song.  Like JCSS said, it's got a western/Americana feel to it.  Shining example of how the band has matured and grown in the right direction.  I just wish it were longer.  Despite its brevity, it's still hands down the best track on the album, and also puts itself in the top 10 tracks they've ever released.*  10/10<br />Victimized.<br />Follow the best track with the worst track on the album.  So bad it's the only track on the entire disc that I've skipped before because it's just so much pointless noise.  Thank you, \\"haters,\\" for making LP feel the need to appease you with this blend of an interesting mix of singing/rapping from Mike and an uninspired screaming chorus from Chester.  5/10<br />Roads Untraveled.<br />A song that starts slow, to the point where you're tempted to hit the skip button, and by the time you're about halfway through, you're glad you didn't.  7/10<br />Skin to Bone.<br />Not a huge fan of this track in terms of lyricism, but I can't ignore the instrumentation here (which is why I'm glad they released an instrumental version of this track).  7/10<br />Until it Breaks.<br />I've noticed that a lot of Mike's rapping has become harder and harder to keep up with.  This one and Lost in the Echo both have difficult lyrics to memorize, and I find myself listening rather than rapping/singing with him on tracks like these, unlike his parts on earlier songs.  Just an observation as to their growing complexity.  Rob's guest singing knocks this above the 7 shelf into the 8s.  8/10<br />Tinfoil.<br />One more example of why I don't understand Mr. Hahn's not making his own solo instrumental album.  Or at least get longer than 2 minutes in the spotlight.  9/10<br />Powerless.<br />The worst track on A Thousand Suns was their closer.  Relatively weak in comparison to the rest of the tracks.  They seem to have learned from their mistake and gone back to the tried-and-true method of ending on a strong note.  Leaves you wanting more, in a good way.  9/10<br /><br />*To qualify, these are my top 10 songs by Linkin Park:<br /><br />1. Numb<br />2. New Divide<br />3. Pushing Me Away<br />4. Waiting for the End<br />5. Castle of Glass<br />6. Breaking the Habit<br />7. In the End<br />8. Leave Out All the Rest<br />9. From the Inside<br />10. I'll Be Gonest wish it were longer.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game reminds me of actual coin games I played as a child. It's fun to play again as an adult. Try it -you'll like it!
B0066NX3PO|5.0|This show continues to maintain my interest with its top notch acting, directing and writing. The characters are well developed. The story in each  episode, usually dealing with a new court case, is interesting as well as on-going plot lines. New characters played by guest stars such as Michael J. Fox keep the series fresh and exciting. I hope this series has a long run.<br />This particular episode deals with the benefits and deficiencies of a jury deliberating on a charge of murder. Anyone who has sat on a jury will be able to identify with their dilemna whether to consider this or that piece of \\"evidence\\" credible. This episode, like all the others, is well paced and will hold your interest.<br />As usual, David Paymer, does a great job as the judge.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Kate Morton has done it again with an enthralling tale spanning a family's history.  She never fails to amaze me.  Such a good read!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Enjoyable match 3 game with powers you can store and use when needed.  Tiles shuffle when there are no moves available which prevents replaying a level unless your time runs out.  The story isn't great but the fact that there is one is neat.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I play this on my iPod Touch, and it's awesome!!!!!  Then I saw it on KF in HD, and I was like, &quot;Sweet!&quot; but, it was $2, so I decided not to buy it.  Now, I see that its free, so I downloaded it!  Smart move Rovio!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Need more story base and less Sex. Not that sex is Bad,but page after page.  Need more of Fifties Busines dealing and her building a publishing business.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Mr. Bonamassa does himself proud with this album, his return to a Blues style is much appreciated by Blues Music fans and will be a great introduction to those who have yet hear  this musical talent.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Many of my friends told me this movie sucked. I didn't expect it to be good at all. So one day my gf and I decided to watch it just for the hell of it and it turned out pretty good. Great CGI and the dwarves were pretty epic. The acting wasn't amazing but it's nothing to complain about. Overall it was a good movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A fast journey into crazy.  Flynn writes as we think, in our secret minds . I always feel like part of a peeping Tom when I read her books.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I have just finisthed reading Cacual Vacancy - one of the very best books I have read in a long time, and I read a lot.<br /><br />This book is a masterpiece and I encourage everyone who still have to read the book to read it with open mind.<br /><br />We all know that J.K. Rowling is one of the very best author ever, that she has proved with her Harry Potter books.<br />Now Ms. Rowling takes on a very different subject.  The story takes place in a little town in England and we get to know very many characters.  I just loved how Ms. Rowling put all those different characters to live and how the story played out.  For me it is a book about parents who do not take good enough care of their children.  And although the parents are all VERY different they all neglect their children in different ways. This is also a book about race for power in this small community but first and foremost the book gives us many examples of narrow minded people who do not see the whole picture.  Some caracters grow as the story folds, but most of them are stuck in their own lives and do not have it in them to understand what a community is.  Some caracters are actually vicious and have no hope.  Some live in circumstances that they have little hope of improving themselves - and certanly not if not helped.  The end is sad, but some of the people have hope for better life, especially the young ones, I think.<br /><br />As said before I read a lot and I have to say here that one of the reason I liked this book so much is the vocabulary.<br />Ms. Rowling ia a master with the English language and I was delighted with so many phrases and wording.<br />This is a bit old fashioned books with lot of caracters and reminds me of the old English Classics - only it takes place today.<br /><br />When I bought this book, Kindle e-book, I read some reviews before I started reading the book.  Some vere good others gave this book a very poor rating.  I can not finish my review without mentioning that I findmany of the 1-2 star ratings quiet offending as so many of them are based on that this book is not a Harry Potter book and therefore the readers were disappointed.  Some gave low ratings for the price.  OK the price is not low, but compared to books by other famous writers this book lies in the same price catagori.  Some gave low ratings as they did not like the book, that I can accept.<br /><br />I apologize for typos and prase of words - english is not my native language.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This book is amazing, it took me not long to read it, i was hooked. i recommend it to anyone :)
B00000264Y|2.0|I don't know where this c/d was made but it only plays 9 songs per side.  There are 25 total songs, but I only get 18.<br />I would have sent this product back, but after playing a couple of tracks I assumed it was ok and through out the shipping package.  Next time I will know better.
B007THA4FI|1.0|OMG! I thought this would be an excellent read given the author-I got through half of it and stopped the \\"madness\\". I could not keep up and or did not want to....this is obviously my opinion and I feel I am quite well read and would like to see what other people's thoughts are on this book-I am guessing I might be in the minority and others will just say they thought it was a blockbuster just to be in the \\"know\\" so to speak-all in all I would leave it at best as a \\"tedious\\" and unrewarding read.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. I have enjoyed reading this one and all of the books in the series.  I have also recommending these books to my students.  My students have also enjoyed reading them.  It is hard to find interesting and fun books to read and recommend to students at times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love it! an awesome game ever but i think the Pc edition beater because it has more like nods and downloadable maps.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The Best Super Hero movie out!!! Its gonna be hard for anyone to top this movie. Marvel finally stepped up got it together
B0015DROBO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I would absolutely suggest it to anyone who loves to read. It steps away from the norm and sheds light on a very dark side of life. These books will cange you if you let them. ps make sure to read them in order.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It combined different types of activities but it had an awesome hint feature.  I wish all games would do that.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I am still ambivalent about this book even after finishing it over a week ago.  The imagery and mental pictures it gives is a wonderful present wrapped in sparkly paper with a fabulous fancy bow.  THE NIGHT CIRCUS is literally made with magic by two young people picked for their 'gifts' by two long lived magicians who care neither for the youngsters nor society, who only live for revenge and 'the elusive win'.  The circus travels by mysterious trains, and has performers who abilities have no limits and lives have no end.  The plot is a little annoying in it's elusiveness and whispiness, THE NIGHT CIRCUS still is worth the read simply for the creativity and originality of images and thoughtfulness of the characters strength and durability.
0316228532|3.0|A well-written book, but I will never read it again, and that's what separates this novel from those that I love.  I like to be able to identify with, or at least like, a minimum of one character in a book.  The only seemingly likeable character in this novel appears to be the one that dies immediately. I just don't enjoy books that shove \\"reality\\" and the sad state of human nature in my face.  I get plenty of that in daily life, and I read to escape or to become enlightened in some way. The overall feeling this book leaves me with is despair, and so... it's time to read more Terry Pratchett!
B002PYW26Y|5.0|In my late 40's, I grew up watching the original Lost in Space on syndicated tv as a kid.  I am very surprised this movie did not do better. Well cast, action packed, funny, and moves fast. Gary Oldman perfect as Dr. Smith.  Original voice of the Robot a great blast from the past.<br />Movie stands alone too, even if you've never seen the original series.
B00992CF6W|1.0|For all of the people that rated it 3 stars and up, I can see why u like it. I play minecraft, but from 4shared.com. They have the full version. What is in the full version is survival mode, wayy more blocks, and you can have multi player. Also<br />4shared.com has different versions of mimecraft if you want to see what the very first one was like. Just type in 'minecraft apk' and then the version you want. Trust me, its epic.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|As a serial iphone case purchaser, I can say this case looks and feels great.  Fits snug on the phone, and offers good protection.  I've dropped it a few times and not a scratch.  Big fan.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This is one book I couldn't put down.  It was outstanding and kept you guessing the entire time.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers.<br /><br />G
B0060D3BWK|5.0|Me and the kids love this movie and watch it all year round! Great family fun and great for kids of all ages!
B006M4F67A|5.0|247 Mahjong is great. If you like to play Mahjong this is the one for you. The art work is beautiful. I play it on my computer and my Kindle.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Coronation Street in the West Country? I loved it because it felt like Taunton, Yeovil (Yarvil in the book?) and Bridgewater where I grew up. Intriguing characters that are contrasted with one another, some are transports from the world of HP. For me it ended abruptly and I'm not sure which characters I'd like to follow if JKR revisits Pagford. As pure entertainment, my Kindle copy is value for money.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell has once again mastered the tale of forensic pathologist Kay Scarpetta. Written in her unique, detailed style, every detail is laid out factually for you to take in. I actually googled information about leatherback turtles, because of curiosity mostly, and found everything detailed in the pages to be factual. I love this series, and hope for many more to come!
B0063IH60K|4.0|app is free so i understand having ads, but i did not like having to figure out how to skip the ads to get to the game. i do like the movement of the cards and have not had any issue with the ads popping up elsewhere as one reviewer did (and certainly hope i don't).
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I am reviewing the 3D blu ray. I am impressed with the 3D adaptation of this movie.<br /><br />After having watched the 3D Blu Ray version of this movie and comparing it to the other so-called 3D movies out there (which I won't name), I am not the least surprised why the 3D Blu Ray industry is suffering.<br /><br />If more films took the time to make an actual 3D movie like Avatar instead of taking shortcuts, I truly believe the 3D movie industry would be thriving.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|I watch this every year got Halloween. Sometimes even when it is not in season. Great cast and stillstill funny after so long.
B008XG1X18|5.0|App has so many uses. I can find anything I could ever dream of and things I didn't even know I could use.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Segmented and confusing, lots of uncommon \\"English phrases\\" used that muddled the authors descriptions and intent. Slow moving. Did not entice familiarity with characters.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I am enjoying the game completely. I would recommend to anyone who likes marching three puzzle game. The music can get annoying but you can just turn ot off.!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|It was difficult to piece together.  The ending was much better. There was alot of food for thought at that point.<br /><br />I don't care for books that are not realistic.......so it was difficult for me to get into the story.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Wall to wall action, great acting, great production, edge of the seat movie. Before watching I had a concern that the movie would be just too many super heroes vying for top billing, but the mix worked well. Movie certainly deserves all of the great reviews and would be one to add to your private collection!
B0072OFM28|5.0|Great acting, special effects and a great story line, of course with all the violence and sex associated with that time frame. I know that when I have come to hate some of the characters, there is some great acting taking place. Brilliant, as the Brits say! I am truly ready for the last episode, even though I know how it ends.
B0067H9W72|5.0|The Walking Dead is always entertaining and character driven. Avoid if you don't enjoy television gore. Each episode offers a satisfying story arc.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is to science fiction what Game of Thrones is to fantasy... it simply cannot be compared to anything else in its genre. It stands out in a completely amazing way. Give it a shot, its one journey you will never regret taking.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I was disappointed in this book, although as one would expect it is very well written.<br />I found all the characters less than compelling and by the end of the book could not have cared less what happened to any of them.<br />The book concerns a dysfunctional set of people in an imaginary village in the West Country of England. All the characters described were singularly unattractive.<br />If the purpose of the book was to describe the small-minded pettiness of the typical English village then it certainly succeeds in doing that. Disappointing after Harry.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Very good read - hard to put down.  Good connections with characters from \\"Fall of Giants\\" and introduction of new characters.  Ken Follett should have been a history teacher; his storytellig style makes it very easy to understand the historical context of the times particularly the struggle againist Facisim.<br />Can't wait for trilogy 3.
B0055S348W|5.0|easy to use, friendly and convenient when to print from phone. I am using it on androind 2.2 and never had problems with it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout. I just did level 1 and I'm sweaty and worn out.  I work with a trainer twice a week and she has  me do many of the same exercises. I think there is little risk of injury, I find Jillian's narration motivating and the music is good. I watched levels 2 and 3 and I look forward to doing them.  This is a perfect workout for busy moms who only have 20 minutes after the kids are in bed  or during naps.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was a good book and a easy read but did not think it was as good as some of  Micth Albom other books.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was waiting for this book to come out and when it did I was slightly disappointed. The Murder plot was interesting, but over all it was repeat of the first book. I will still buy the next book because I want to know how the series will end
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The story was interesting and captivating but the writing wasn't! The way it was written was more like a student paper describing an event and not  a riveting tale told by an experienced story teller.
1449410243|5.0|I have never written an Amazon review before (as you will see, for good reason). However the negative reviews of this book are amazeballs. Either people are 1)having technical issues with the e-book 2)have never read Matthew Inman's online comics or 3) didn't look at the book's description before buying it (and expecting it to be like his first book).<br /><br />Addressing each of these:<br /><br />1) When MS Works doesn't work on your Windows 98 PC, do you blame the writer? Oh yeah, you are the person holding your mouse upside down and calling the support desk to come down to fix it.<br /><br />2) Do your homework man! If the title didn't give you a heads up that this book is a bit effed up, then reading Matthew's online content would surely give you an indication of what you're in for. If you don't like profanity and you read /bought this book...only you are to blame for not having enough media literacy to make a good decision about your purchase.<br /><br />3) Read the author's webpage for this book (Amazon won't let me post it here). It very clearly describes a book ALL ABOUT CATS. Additionally, when do you expect an author's book to be exactly like his/her last book? Ok...except for Cormac Mccarthy.<br /><br />Ok...if you've gotten this far in my stupid little rant, here's my psuedo review. If you like The Oatmeal, you are a crazy cat person that knows you are a crazy cat person (and/or simply enjoy laughing at crazy cat people), and you realize you should buy the actual physical/paper copy of graphic content (most of which is available online for free, but you like supporting artists and their awesome works), then stop reading my crappy review and go buy this book. If not, stop reading my crappy review and use the comments to tell me how dumb this review is.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Oatmeal is nothing if not pure genius. If you don't get that, you should really question the value of your life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Awesome website.  I use it every day!  I find many, many crafts, recipes and ideas to use in my every day life.
B009EAO38C|5.0|We love the arrangements put together by the piano guys!  They are fun to listen to.  My little girls love \\"Cello Wars\\" and my older kids love them all.  They are clean and uplifting.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Well written, social realistic novel, about the lack of understanding we have for each other, rich vs poor, children vs parents, teachers vs students, and the complications that can come from this.<br />The action is very slow paced, and the focus is in explaining the many main characters beliefs and thoughts, basically explaining how they can do what others may see as completely unacceptable.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Was very pleased with this final season of House.  The extras with Hugh's directing sequence & the program before the finale were both excellent. Have watched several  times already.  They really went out with a bang.  So glad House lives!!!!<br /><br />Will definitely miss this wonderful series but I'll have 8 terrific DVD's for each season.  The extras for each season were very enjoyable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|the beggining is a little boring but once you get to the anouceing of the quell it gets way better
B0053O89WY|5.0|My DVD arrived in the time that was given. I love the Big Bang Theory and was happy to be able to see Season 5 as soon as it arrived.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This is a high-quality sequel with intelligent contributions from the writers, actors, and director Joss Whedon. The development of the characters, from Samuel L. Jackson's one-eyed, growling Nick Fury to Chris Evans idealistic Captain America to Robert Downey's smart-aleck Ironman learning to play well with others, reflects what made Marvel special in the first place. The action scenes are like seeing a big, graphically rich comic page come to life. And it's not just action; there are quite unexpected plot twists. My only caveat is that the bad guys' motivation seems a little thin (apparently they're just bad). Loki seems to suffer from the conventional movie-script father conflict (yawn). But, after all, the good guys are the main attraction, and they're -- well, super!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think it is just a finding game and that is what it is but the title makes it seem very interesting when it is not.
B000I9UA30|5.0|Another excellent movie. It is tops on my list of adventures. I know that a lot of people like more adventure and cut 'em up, blood and guts, but this is as far as I like it. Good job!
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This chess game is ok. I dont love it, but will play it from time to time.  I would have liked bigger pieces and more colorful pieces.  I havent played it long enough to know if in the long run it will be fun. but so far so good
B009A3NGF4|5.0|M & S brings a style and grace to their sons unmatched in this day and age! I am a big fan!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple to learn. Fun to play. This game has lots of levels of play. Great for ALL ages.  Toddlers to teens, adults,  parents and grandparents! No tricky typing. Just draw lines to connect dots.<br />Only thing missing is the wipes to clean the screen!
034580404X|5.0|Very good book. Keeps u reeled in, wanting to know what happens next.  Great book also for couples wanting to spice it up.
B0042C1BP0|4.0|Great movie daniel craig as james bond is a stroke of genius. The. Bad guy is one of a kind.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I played this game on my home Pc...switched to a Kindle at Xmas time...and looked almost everyday for this app...finally. It is a great game...yes it may cost if you run out of life,  but replenished in time...really how much should one be playing games :)
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I ordered this cd because it had 4-5 stars.I happened to find a concert of them with previous songs on Directv. They blew me away! I guess I love Southern Rock, like Lynyrd Skyryd.Bravo guys.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|By far, one of the greatest books I've read in ages. Number 9 Dream was brilliant, but this is even better. A must read for anyone who enjoys fiction.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book is a page turner. I finished it the same day it downloaded onto my kindle. While I really do enjoy the books, I don't find myself as connected to these characters as I did with 50 Shades. Great storyline and looking forward to the 3rd installments.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|worked great on my kindle fire. beautiful graphics and had alot of fun playing it. highly recomend it if you love puzzle games!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a movie that will lift your spirits and make you smile.  It's so refreshing to have a movie appeal to more than just teenagers, although I think they would also enjoy it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Didn't truly like the first book until I read this one. It sent me back to re read the first one. I am anxiously anticipating #3.  This book had me uncomfortable in its conflict until the end. I had never read any of Day' s stuff before. Glad I didn't quit after Bared to you.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch has done it again.  This book was such a good read for me that I read it in one day...Surely gave me different thoughts of my time and what all it means to me, my husband and my family.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the last book a lot.  There was a lot of action and a little humor thrown in.  Can't wait for the movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many useful recipes, household cleaning tips and decorating ideas.  I am hooked on \\"pinning\\" and sharing with others.  Love having so many ideas in one spot.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book and all the ones before it! i'm currently starting from scratch and reading the lightning thief again. I could not put this book down. I read this front to back in less than 2 days and i still want more. I can't wait for the next one! I actually couldn't wait for this one so i bought it for my kindle instead of hardcover like i usually do. i'm so glad i didn't wait mark of athena was one of the best books i've read all year.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this! A real challenge! Good when you have lots of time on your hands to kill! Starts out easy and then you have to think, based on your previous successful completions. I don't even care how I did, just that I finished it!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I've read mixed reviews.  To me it's one of the two or three best albums since destroyer.  Total Klassic early songs with the edge of Unholy.  I really like it.  Top to bottom solid album.  I think this is the album we wish Psycho Circus could have been if Ace and Peter had had more input.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|While watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I kept wondering why there was only one Oompa-Loompa, sometimes made into several using what looked like 1960s trick photography.  Tim Burton's other effects were good, as usual. Depp's acting was all right - he always goes for something original and he usually succeeds - one of the all-time greats; but Depp did come across as acting in this one, rather than as convincing.  Gene Wilder was too hard an act to follow without doing Willy in drag, or something.  The reason I would not bother to see this film a second time was the odd decision to use one actor to play all of the Oompa-Loompas (165 of them).  What motivated that decision?  Every Oompa-Loompa scene (and there are many) got monotonous.  I can find other ways to be bored ... for free. I give this film one Oompa-Loompa. That's all Tim Burton gave us.
B003Q97D48|1.0|The first episode was about a 4 out of 10 for me and then went down in subsequent episodes. I watched the whole first season since I paid for it and thought there mught be a good payoff in the end but unforunately this was not the case. The storylines became very dramatic and silly. The 16 year olds seem to be more intelligent than the adults. The storylines of a mysterious stalker are not addressed by the police and it is never clear why the girls feel they need to be so secretive. The target audience of this show is probably 14-16 year old girls but it is not appropriate for this age group- for example one of the girls is dating her teacher while one of the girl's mother feels she needs to sleep with a cop in exchange for helping her daughter, drama for drama's sake. Dissapointing as there is real potential. It reminded me a bit of a teenage despersate housewives but turned out to be more hollow.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie and graphics were beautifully clear  on my kindle fire! Love being able to watch whenever and I also recommend amazon prime.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these headphones back in the early 90's  but at some point  I lost them. I honestly can't remember how they sounded but was more impressed on how great looking they were. I just love the way they look.  Now that I think about it, they might have been the v6 which look the same. Some say the v6 sound different , more \\"juicy\\" and these sound more \\"true\\" to the sound, which might be too plain for some.<br /><br />Well, I'm no audiophile and can't explain in detail how they sound but for me they sound DAMN GOOD!  I listen to ..rock/metal/hip hop/80's/oldies  and these headphones have not let me down. I would have a hard time believing that someone wound not love the way these cans sound.<br /><br />At some point I'm going to buy the SONY v6 to have for a back up pair and I'll really be able to see how they differ in sound. I will update review to say if I hear any difference.<br /><br />The best thing about these headphones are the price. There is no way you can find a better sounding pair of cans for the price that these are being sold for. I love these cans. A+
B003NX75B8|5.0|Great book. A quick and fun read. A great escape. One tow three four five six seven eight nine ten.
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you've read the first, you are going to read the rest. They are all better then what I anticipated and look forward to reading them all again. Enjoy!
B0086700CM|5.0|very good game plz make a second one because the first one was good but I bet the second one is better
030758836X|2.0|I am one who adored Gillian Flynn's first two works.  This was disappointing.  There was no-one to like.  The people were not believable...well, maybe Go.  It was just contrived to me.  I'll never give up because I think Gillian is brilliant but all the hype about Gone was NOT worth it.  I had to force myself to finish it.  Sigh.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is a great game for tablet. not very challenging, as i seem to get most gold crowns, but still fun.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I got this as a FAOTD.  This is one of just a few games on my Fire that has actually been fun.  It's a puzzle game that starts off simple, but gets harder in later levels.  I liked the power up system.  No IAP, but it does ask you to review it.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|Muy buena calidad de película, además de ser un excelente título. This blu ray is exelent and the movie is exelent to.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|This was a movie I had high hopes for. Too bad it completely sucks! It leaves you confused because of the nonsensical plot, or lack thereof.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Not your typical action movie, but you still see plenty of bad guys get beaten.  It's more toward the realistic end of the spectrum.  Very entertaining!
0307341577|3.0|On the one hand this book reminded me of Vernon God Little: poor, small-town white people on the edges of society doing the best they can. The density of the detail and the first-person voice of Libby Day also had a strong ring of authenticity, as did the emotional and psychological impact of a violent crime. (This is where it differs considerably from Vernon God Little, which is actually very funny.) On the other hand it reminded me of the documentary Paradise Lost, about the West Memphis Three, where the odd boys, the ones dressed in black, are failed by the institutions that are supposed to protect them (community, families, courts, police) because they match the profile of imaginary devil worshippers.<br /><br />While other reviewers did not like (or even hated) the various lowlifes that populate the novel, I felt Flynn did an exceptional job of showing us their struggles to make life work - from the angry kleptomaniac Libby to the broken and divorced farm wife and mother to the overage and addicted dive-bar stripper. Make no mistake, it is frustrating that none of them appear able to see (reasonable) escape paths from the lives they've been born to. But that doesn't dispel compassion or sympathy, at least not in my case.  Just like DBC Pierre, I felt Flynn actually likes most of the characters she was writing about (with a couple of clear exceptions).<br /><br />Unfortunately those characters are stuck in a mystery that doesn't quite work. After the big reveal, you can go back and connect all the pieces and hints and set-ups, and sure enough they all fit together. But the end still stretches credibility. (If the characters had been more cookie cutter, it may have worked, but then I probably would not have read it.) Flynn is such a strong writer that I wish she would have done her story more like The Wire. Rather than create a mystery, give us the killer in advance, then use the story to go even deeper into the institutions that fail their adherents.<br /><br />Having said that, the tension generated by the mystery and people's attempts to conceal it compelled me to stay up late reading. Yes the ending was disappointing, but the world the book creates was not.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|when i got this book i didnt know what to expect of it.soon i found out that if  you like adventure and excitment you would really like this book.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Story exemplifies the meaning of the word hope. The acting was pretty good most of the time with a. Few great moments.  Over all though, it was a bit corny. Would I watch it again?  Perhaps if there was nothing else to do. I watched it in the first place because several of my wife's friends said we just had to see it. So, it would have to be said the reviews were mixed at our house.
0345803485|4.0|I have to say I have read all three books to this and this one was my least favorite but curiosity won and I have to admit I loved the series as a whole. Grant it, Christian has issues because of a traumatic childhood and he's not had anyone to help him deal with them until Ana comes along. Mind you at times she doesn't help with his insecurities and some of the things from his past she can't let go of. If you find yourself questioning as to whether to read the rest of the series, I say definitely do as they are worth the read.
0525952926|5.0|Over the years I've managed to read a lot of what Ken Follet has written.  He captured my attention with 'Eye of the Needle' and kept it with a string of thrillers.<br /><br />In my opinion Follet is at his best when undertaking an epic saga of historical fiction. His medieval tome 'Pillars of the Earth' was amazing and for me, truly defines the genre. The same holds true for his follow up 'World Without End'.<br /><br />I was excited to learn of his then newest effort several years ago 'Fall of Giants'.  Similarly, it sets the stage for a farther reaching saga spanning decades to a century and more. While the first installment deals with the diaspora of Russians fleeing the country (or not) following the Bolshevik Revolution, the second book in the trilogy 'Winter of the World' provides a chilling account of interpersonal drama and conflict set on an international scale.<br /><br />While the characters central to the story line in both books are present - the ones from 'Fall of Giants' are now older and the story shifts to their offspring - they interact with key figures of historical relevance; these include Churchill, Stalin, FDR and Hitler.  No attempt is made to shield the reader from the atrocities of the Fascists, Nazis or Communists before, during and after WWI & WWII.<br /><br />Like many of Follet's books, I was simply drawn into the tale told in an amazingly clear, concise and realistic way. My only criticism is that there are many characters and locales.  I found it hard to keep up with the swirl of details surrounding the lives of each one. Nevertheless, \\"Winter of the World' earns a rare five star rating from this reviewer.  I look forward to reading the third book in the trilogy.
0345803493|5.0|Insecurity is high for both Christina and Ana's relationship. His exes seem to keep appearing in their lives and business and make it difficult on them. Not to mention a boss that wants more from Ana than she's willing to give.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Reviewing all of Studio Ghibli's films chronologically, you come to expect certain things. One, you expect the films to be sublime. And Porco Rosso is no exception to that general film. Two, you expect there to be a divide between the Hayao Miyazaki films (Nausicaa, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service) and the Isao Takahata films (Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday). In general, the Miyazaki films are fantastical and with an environmental message while the Takahata films are more realistic. Porco Rosso, a Miyazaki film, straddles the line between the two.<br /><br />Our protagonist is a flying pig, who before the events of the film was a man who was cursed to appear as a pig. That is the only fantastical element. The rest of the film is set post WWI in the Adriatic Sea. It is a world of flying seaships full of pirates and bounty hunters, such as Porco. If you have watched other Miyazaki films then you know that he loves the sky and has set entire civilizations in the sky. Here, once again, the background is lovingly animated and takes place mostly in the clouds. The story itself is straight forwardly told, although truth be told, the film is light on story and dwells on beautiful aerial shots. What little there is of the story concerns Porco and his attempts to defeat an American pilot for the hand of a beautiful young mechanic/to settle his debts with said young mechanic. That's it. Now that does not make the film bad, it just means that you get through it quickly, unlike other Studio Ghibli films.<br /><br />Porco Rosso makes the 7th Studio Ghibli film I have now reviewed here on Amazon. I have to state that it is short and sweet, but probably my least favorite Studio Ghibli thus far.
0345803507|5.0|This one I have to say is my favorite of the three. Christian and Ana are dealing with Christian's past and he's finally relaxing and enjoying life. But there is someone out to get him and he's afraid he won't be able to keep his loved ones safe.
