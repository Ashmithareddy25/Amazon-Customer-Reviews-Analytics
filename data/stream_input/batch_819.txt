B000OPPBEQ|2.0|I thought the original Matrix was a brilliant movie. The second and third went a long way to destroy the story. If my options are:<br /><br />A) live in a dream state and have my energy used up by computers<br />or<br />B) dance in a mosh pit in a cave at the Earth's Core with scantly clad smelly people<br /><br />I select A. Plug me in. Let me dream.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|I've just received the Bourne Ultimatum and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. I can't find it in stores in Melbourne, so I've sourced it here. I like the Bourne movies because they are so real...a confession, I've fantasised about being Jason Bourne. Matt Damon is believable as the troubled amnesiac black ops agent.  The only problem is that there are unresolved issues between Bourne and Julia Stiles (I forget her characters name). There are hints of an emotional involvement, and I strongly suspect that it was she who recruited Bourne into the CIA. But apart from this it's a great movie.

B001HYSZQY|5.0|This season has to be one of the most tightly-wound ever in a tightly-written series with an incredible amount of attention to detail, and this episode tightens things a little more. The monster of the week has to be one of the more disturbing ones so far. Granted, we've seen a human turn into a monster before, but this one is more subtle and the transformation more gradual yet shocking in that it starts with something simple and seemingly harmless: who hasn't had a male relative or acquaintance who's cleaned out the refrigerator before... But what if it was more sinister than just the hungry-horrors...? (It also put me in mind of the hunger-demon in the debut arc of \\"John Constantine: Hellblazer\\") And at the same time, it seems to mirror the internal transformation going in in Sam, during Dean's sojourn in hell. But, after he used that \\"let's talk about it\\" ruse to coax the man-turned monster into a trap, can we really trust Sam to keep his promise to Dean? This is one season that I don't want to miss a minute of, and I'm grateful that Amazon is offering download episodes...
B001FBSMW6|3.0|This cd is where the old and new Keane mesh together, in perfect harmony. Tom's soaring vocals is what makes this album 3 stars. First 5 songs are poppy, yet you still hear the old Keane in there. This album is for the masses, as well as seasoned Keane fans!
B00133KFGW|4.0|I saw a clip of this movie on YouTube and decided to buy it on Amazon.  While I enjoyed it overall, I would have liked it better if they focused more on this boy's musical talents as he was growing up, instead it starts after he is already a preteen, and the Movie focuses more on building to the climax of his musical talent bringing his lost parents together which was the end of the movie.  The best parts of the movie total about 15-20 minutes, and the rest of it seems like nothing more than filler.  This movie could have been so much better if the focus was more about the life and behavior of a growing child musical prodigy, rather than what is offered.  The ending alone, does make the movie worth watching, and it was the only part that got me involved emotionally.  I rate it four stars for the ending, the rest of it I would rate two stars.<br /><br />bill[[ASIN:B00133KFGW August Rush]]

B001E75QGG|5.0|At peace with this film...<br /><br />Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull<br /><br /> When I first laid my eyes on this film it was midnight on May 22nd, to say I was upset would be incorrect, I was confused, tired, and very disappointed.  I chose later on to see the film again, just to make sure my opinion wasn't blurred by the hour and amount time I had been awake, I was less confused, less tired, but still disappointed.<br /><br /> \\"How could they do this to us?\\" I thought.  Steven Spielberg and George Lucas are master craftsman, how could they deliver this thin story with poor effects.  After the Star Wars  prequel fiasco I was a little worried about George's involvement, but he was the producer and I falsely believed  that Steven could avoid his movie killing grip.<br /><br /> I could go on about the bad,  but me being me and that I would never let a saga go incomplete in my movie collection, so I purchased the BLU-RAY version.  That is where that genius of this film is revealed,  gone was the confused and disappointed feeling.  I realized unlike the other films which endured because of  their playability in a movie theatre, this film plays better at home.  I enjoyed this film and I dare say it is the best BLU-RAY in my collection.  I came to the conclusion, in the theatre I was on \\"information overload\\" too much new information, in a world most of us know thru and thru.  However at home I was able to take it all in. pause and rewind if need be.<br /><br />This movie is great and in ten years it will receive it's due.<br /><br />Steven, George, good work.
B0002A2WDQ|3.0|After recieving Crossroads in the mail I was excited! I popped it in the DVD player and watched it.  It was a great movie.  My only concern was that the DVD had a small indention in it which made the movie skip.  I'm not sure if there was any of the movie that I was missing.  Other then that I was very pleased with the time it took them to ship the product.  It only took a few days.  Thank You!!

B0017ZB8M6|5.0|After hearing I Kissed a Girl, I visited her My Space page just to see what everyone was talking about and instantly LOVED Hot N Cold, so I bought the CD.  Nearly every song is great, but Hot N Cold is still the best.  So glad it's the next single.  Don't judge Katy Perry just on I Kissed a Girl.  She is a very underrated vocalist.  She's much more than the novelty act some people think.  Get this CD!

B0002W4SWC|4.0|This movie has a special place in my heart, because I saw it screened at my college shortly after September 11th, 2001, when everyone was in serious need of some mental relief.  This movie delivers, with hilarious situations and a sweetness that leaves you feeling pretty good at the end.  Loosely based on Pride and Prejudice, the casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy is a tongue-in-cheek shout-out to fans of the original BBC production in which he excellently portrays the original Darcy. I have to admit, I had no opinion of Renee Zellweger before this movie, but loved her as Bridget.  One nitpick - she was supposed to be chubby?  Even with an extra 20 lbs, Renee looked normal, healthy, and cute. As is the usual case, the book is better, but the movie is great fun, and chock-full of \\"Hey, it's that British Guy\\"s.

1416594884|4.0|John LeCarre raised the standard for spy stories during the height of the Cold War.  Fleming's James Bond was fun escapism but LeCarre's tales give the reader the feeling of really being in the know.  Instead of glamorous locales, thrilling adventures and the certainty that good guys will always triumph in the end.  With LeCarre's novels we were taken into the street next to our own and placed into a demi-monde where the lines between hero and villian are blurry at best and the outcome is by no means certain.      A MOST WANTED MAN is set into modern day Hamburg and begins in the Turkish immigrant community as a strange young man appears.  The stranger, Issa, manages to prevail upon a family to take him, much against the son's good judgment.  From there Issa begins to waft his way through Hamburg society, first to a lawyer working for a humanitarian organization, then to a wealthy middle aged banker and finally coming to the attention of various shadowy members of espionage organizations.  Everyone this mysterious young man meets finds their lives forever altered by the encounter.    This is no light hearted romp into a sunkissed fantasy world but is instead as dark and grey as a rain washed Hamburg street on a November day.  The characters are so well drawn that they will undoubtedly stay with the reader long after the final page.  The only sour notes in this novel are perhaps the feeling of futility that permeates, it seems that the characters are being inescapably drawn into events and the ending which leaves the fates of many of the characters hanging - rather like real life.
B001DDCVCI|5.0|There were two Folsom shows performed and recorded that day: The first show, the bulk of which comprised the classic, familiar 16-song album; and a longer second show, the bulk of whose 26 tracks (except for two songs) were put on the shelf.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I don't claim to know much about the history of this country, nor the history of the world really. I only began to take interest in things bigger than myself in recent years. I admit, applying real world stories to a dramatic medium increases the appeal of something that is already so significant but that's just exactly what this mini-series did to me. It made me think about the literal idea of me standing here being able to live in a world and time where I can come home, chill, grab a bit to eat, and write this review on a lazy Tuesday evening. Sounds like a clich&eacute;d endorsement perhaps, but the corniness doesn't make it any less true. I am Asian-American so even more so am I amazed and grateful that it's because of the founding principles of this country that I am leading a comfortable life, although that's not to say it wasn't a struggle to get to where we are today...and believe me, I know things still aren't perfect.<br /><br />And I think that's one of the key words that should be attributed to \\"John Adams\\", however general: struggle. If so far, you are conjuring images of a sweeping, glorified epic tale of our revolution, well, I have to say my words were probably a bit misleading. There are times, especially in the first few parts where the tone feels that way but make no mistake, this is the portrait of John Adams, the excellent supporting characters, and his relation to his country and the world. Where the word struggle comes into play are the moments when I realize that disagreements will certainly exist in this world, and there will be many of them. Such is the case here. The real undertaking of establishing a nation isn't as bright or glorious as we like to make it seem sometimes. Congress may not always act, there may be people whose intentions aren't quite noble, public opinion may affect the politics etc. So with that in mind, you incorporate great in-depth characters like John, his impressively insightful wife Abigail, Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. And in \\"John Adams\\", they are portrayed as real people rather than what our mythology depicts them to be, although there certainly are scenes heightened in vitriol for dramatic effect.<br /><br />As you continue to watch, you certainly notice some of the characters' imperfections, namely the title character. He may be noble in spirit, but many times he doesn't have the social tact or grace to get through certain political situations as it was in the painful scenes of him and Benjamin Franklin in France. Which really begs the question, \\"How do you judge a man?\\" or would that be too egocentric to ask. Also, there are times when you actually do question Adam's goodwill when he makes statements regarding whatever credit he deserves, or his disappointment with his lack of popularity compared to other relatively softer spoken comrades (and nemeses). At times, John comes off very passionate, with great qualities of leadership shining through. Those same characteristics are also his flaws as you will soon see. Other times, he is very petulant, almost childish and belligerent. There are times that I literally got frustrated in how he incited train wrecks of social and politically important situations. That's what makes his story so compelling to me. It's very easy to depict good guys and bad guys as many (certainly not all) network television shows are proof of that. Not so here: you will cry for him and other times you will want to hold your face in your hands and say to him, \\"What the **** are you doing?!\\" The supporting characters like Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson contrast very well with Adams, and so does Abigail (I'll get to her later). Because their words are gentler, and therefore politically helpful, rifts of friendship begin to form sooner or later. There is even a point when Adams is clearly chided by Franklin in one of the more memorable quotations in the series: \\"A good diplomat observes much, acts little, and speaks softly.\\" Uh, apparently John didn't get that memo LOL. To digress, there are other great quotes, one from Abigail: \\"You do not need to quote great men to show you are one.\\"<br /><br />Abigail is the constant in John Adam's life. For all his flaws and his ill-tempered behavior, you will also see moments where you realize that \\"jerks\\" (and yes, he certainly was one in a good amount of scenes) have people to love, and people that love him. She is also what grounds Adams due to her more diplomatic sensibilities and her ability to not only see things that her husband may not have caught, but also to tell them straight to him when necessary, regardless of how he may take it.<br /><br />The performances are nothing short of amazing, and coming from an actor, it means much to me. I've read in some places and websites where people think Giamatti was miscast. Honestly, I won't even touch the statement because I don't have a large enough frame of reference yet. When I read more literature about him, maybe I'll edit this review to reflect added thoughts. As it is, Giamatti is clearly a terrific and gifted actor if I were to judge his performance at face value. Linney is amazing and I didn't expect otherwise. All the actors are very capable of nuanced performances and pushing it to emotional levels in key places so that the overall palette has a lot of color. Wilkinson who plays Franklin, and the actors that play Jefferson and Washington are wonderful as well. Casting wise, I thought everything was top notch.<br /><br />Some of what I may have written may contain spoilers already (as warned) but I tried to mostly limit them to showing you examples of what I find to be, well, exemplary. Here is another one, which I believe to be one of the main points of this work: HUGE SPOILER There is a scene later on when Adams reconciles with a friend due to differences in political/social views among other things. It was done in correspondence and one of them writes something to the effect of the importance of living in a nation where it is alright to disagree and that it cannot get in the way of friendship. Well, my friends, we are currently living at a...dramatic time in our history and I also believe it is important to honor the opinions of people who may not agree with you. What we have to remember that regardless of our differing perspectives, we all love this country for all its merits and despite our flaws. I believe everyone is capable of having civilized discussions and \\"going negative\\" is just not what our country is founded on, even if it is a reality of the world (which is all the more reason to rise above it). It would not be right if I believe every McCain supporter is dishonorable, just as it would not be right if I believe with naivet&eacute; that every Obama supporter is teeming with complete benevolence. The truth and serious considerations of consequences of our actions should be what matters. And to that end, everyone should be respectful to each other because we all have very different ideas of what those things are. There is also nothing wrong admitting shortsightedness and adopting different viewpoints if one truly believes it's right to do so. You may call this message to be a bit of stretch but frankly if that's to be something I got out of watching this, I'd say I got more than my money's worth.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Well, it's been some time since I've written this review and I take back what I said about our current situation. It seems we're slaves to a two party prison and the corporations and the Fed are calling all the shots. Had I bothered to be informed back in November, I would've voted differently.

B001C08RHA|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed this movie alot. The special effects were good as was the action, and it had many genuinely funny moments.    The first flaw comes in the form of inappropriate content with the pole dancers in the plane and the one night stand (which could have been implied without actually having the scene in the bed - just to show Tony's self absorbed nature at the beginning of the film). These scenes added nothing to the movie and are completely inappropriate for a movie you know is targetted towards kids (why else all the Iron Man toys?).    The other flaw is a plot point. After his experience, I would think it more believable if his first reaction was to start secret investigations to find out how terrorists got his weapons, rather than deciding to stop making them altogether. (After seeing the American soldiers slautered around me, I would still be interested in making things that would give THEM the advantage in any such future engagements.)
B0013FNC38|5.0|We love this album.  Jason Mraz' music is like endless amazing surprises. It delights with its freshness, makes you laugh with its sensual innuendos and such unique off-the-wall cool lyrics to his romantic tales; it's sometimes pure jazzy, nostalgically adolescent, pop and then like caramel. Every song is so good and has its own feel.  He plays with his voice, and makes sounds that give you chills.  I can't get enough, so I'll just have to buy more.
B001BGTWXI|3.0|it's an ok album... past albums were way better, i think the metal industry is molding slipknot... they created a revolution at one point, no one souded like them not anymore, now everyone sounds like them ... this album sounds like hatebreed, messhugah, lamb of god... they lost there originality. And i actually like the soft songs it actually shows there talent instead of wanking of a bunch of notes and headbanging.

0743290119|2.0|I can't decide on whether to give this a 2 star or a 3 star. Not for the first time I wish Amazon has a .5 rating. I like this book but also found it tedious in places. Chick lit is supposed to be fun; it isn't supposed to be a drag and full of whiny characters. At the same time though, I was compelled to finish this book, why, I don't know because it really isn't the best book I've read and it'll be one of those forgettable ones.     The three characters are all best friends and are approaching 30, without being married or settled down in a long-term relationship. There is Adriana, the sexy former model who goes through men like ice cream. Then there's Leigh, a rising star at a prestigious publishing house, engaged to be married to a sweet, kind and sociable man. There's Emmy, newly single after her boyfriend of 5 years dumped her for a younger woman just fresh out of college. Their stories are trite and predictable, which is why I found this tedious. But at the same time, it is a light read and perfect for those brainless moments when one doesn't want to think about anything at all. It's perfect for those moments before you sleep at night or take a nap or doze off in the sunshine while sunbathing.     If you like chick lit, this book is ok for that. But to save your money, make sure you borrow this book instead of buying it. It's fun in the sense of the name-dropping and the styles ... but as character developments go, forget it. None of the characters are really fun to read about. Adriana really annoyed me especially when her parents came to NYC to stay at their apartment and she acted like a spoiled brat. Leigh really drove me insane with her constant sniping at her fiance and Emmy? She's probably the most likable of all the characters but still ...     10/15/08

On her debut Jennifer delivers both the full-throttle raise-the-roof booming ballads and the more HIP-HOP/POP stuff the likes of Rihanna and Ciarra have made a career of. The album tries to satisfy everyone as Ms. Hudson takes on all genres and masters all. There is not a loser in the bunch (still, I wish the album included her duet with Ne-Yo, \\"Leaving Tonight\\"). Not to dis Fantasia who appears here with the woman who should have won Idol the year Fantasia emerged victorious but when the two spar here vocally, well, Fantasia is simply annihilated by Hudson's amazing vocal power and multi-octave range.    Forget about American Idol, Hudson has transcended that pop slop competition and she has become THE NEXT BIG THING.

0452287022|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". I was hooked from the first page. I think the author does a very good job in telling the story of how the painting became so famous. I thought it was very brave of Griet being a young Protestant girl to be willing to go work as a maid in a house of Catholics so her family could survive. When I first started reading the book, I predicted that she would quit her job as the maid because of the painting in her \\"bedroom\\" and how it made her unable to sleep. But when she continued to work there and fulfill her duties, I was shocked. When the new up and coming artist Johannes Vermeer, decides to make their maid, Griet, his new inspiration I asked myself why such a famous man like him would paint the woman that keeps his house in order.  But when I looked at the final paintings shown in the book, I saw what made her so inspirational. I figured that all of the rich buyers of the paintings would really like the ones he painted of his own maid working. In the paintings it showed a maid working in clothing that weren't as nice as the people she was serving.  However, I did not like it when it seemed like when she first started working at the house she had more work to do than the other person that worked there. All in all, I think it was a fantastic book that taught me history by telling a story. I would recommend this book to anyone, it's a great book and if you haven't already read it, I would choose it as your next book to read.
0385340990|5.0|When I first started blogging this summer, I read a lot about The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, so I went out and bought it.  Then, I let it sit on the shelf for a while because I was afraid my expectations were too high.  Boy, was I wrong.  I loved this book - it was even better than I expected.<br /><br />This book is written as a series of letters.  World War II has just ended and Juliet Ashton, who is an author, is living in London when she receives a  letter from Dawsey Adams who lives on Guernsey, one of the Channel Islands.  Dawsey has an old book that had belonged to Juliet at one time.  In his letter he mentions the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, a sort of book club, that sprang up because of the German occupation of Guernsey during World War II.  This leads to a flurry of letters between Juliet and members of the Society.  Juliet decides there might be a book in the story of the lives of these people and decides to visit Guernsey.  Once there, she falls in love with the island and it's people.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines in the book is in a letter from Juliet to Dawsey when she says, \\"That's what I love about reading: one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you onto another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book.  It's geometrically progressive - all with no end in sight, and for no other reason than sheer enjoyment.\\"  This book is charming and delightful.  It made me want to visit Guernsey and made me miss the art of letter writing.
B000OPPBEQ|2.0|This series was great for one movie, the first one.    Never seen such a promising storyline get ruined so fast in the sequels.  Who helped those idiots write the first one? There has to be a ghost writer no one knows about.    Not worth the money as a set.  5 stars for the very first movie.

1565123875|5.0|Purple Hibiscus, is a wonderful piece of literary fiction. It is a coming of age story, a story of domestic violence, and a look at freedom. The characters are well-developed.<br /><br />Fifteen year old Kambili, lives a life of privilege in with her parents, and her brother Jaja in Nigeria. The father, Eugene is a wealthy businessman, a religious fanatic, and a strict disciplinarian. His family is the recipient of his cruel and unusual forms of punishment. The book opens on Palm Sunday, with the father, Eugene, throwing a prayer book across the room, trying to hit his son for his refusal to taken communion at mass earlier in the day. This is just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />Later in the story Kambili and Jaja spend some time away from home at their Aunty Ifeoma's home. At this home there is laughter, love, few rules and much freedom. Later, the mother also spends some time there, and soon they begin to question the strict rules Eugene makes them adhere to. What follows changes their lives forever.<br /><br />This book was an amazing debut novel. I had both the written version and the audio version (the reader was excellent). It was not necessary to have the written copy to enjoy this book however, I was curious about some of the names and phrases so the written form was helpful. I definitely plan to read more by this author.

The first two songs are vaguely reminiscent of U2 and have a good kick to them both lyrically and musically.  \\"Better Than This\\" has a weird David Bowie (think \\"Ashes to Ashes\\") keyboard vibe that never grabbed my attention.  \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything\\" has very subtle New Order guitar-riffs in the background and it also failed to do anything for me.  That said, being the worst 2 tracks on the album, I wouldn't count them as \\"unlistenable.\\"    The album gets back on track with \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" and from that point forward, the album is definitely more of the Keane fare that we love with a new sound.  Notable favorites are the haunting \\"You Don't See Me\\" and the soaring \\"Playing Along,\\" which builds up to an overwhelming crescendo of sound in the end.    The album has its flaws and is probably the least favorite of their first 3 albums which is interesting in that it actually has 2 of their best songs in \\"You Don't See Me\\" and \\"Playing Along.\\"  If you are completely die-hard about the first 2 albums, then you might not be willing to open your mind to the possibility of the band's latest evolution.  But it grows on you so long as you skip tracks 3 and 4.    It's still definitely worth getting.  I think that Keane is only just getting started.
B001DELX08|5.0|I used to have the DVD of Decca version of La Traviata featuring Angela Gheorghiu. I liked it but this blu-ray provides a whole new experience with its great high definition vision and audio. Ms. Gheorghiu, as Violetta, performs amazingly in both singing and acting. It's great to observe all the details of the singer's facial expressions and gestures in hi-def. Mr. Vargas, as Alfredo, performs very well even though his acting is rather clumsy. The baritone, as the father, sings flawlessly. I thought the production was also excellent. I expected more from the Gypsy's dance/song but all in all this title deserves five stars.     This is my very first opera title in blu-ray and I'm more falling in love with blu-ray after watching this Verdi's masterpiece. I know I'll be watching it over and over again especially the first act.    Technically, it was shot in 1080i and features PCM 2.0 & DTS HDMA 7.1 audio track. No extras.
1400064287|5.0|Made to Stick is a book about making yourself a better, more influential person.  How you use that power is ultimately up to you (although I recommend using it for good) but there's no doubt this book is of more practical value than anything I've read in years.    How's that possible?  Chip and Dan Heath have laid out a practical guide to a skill that acts as a force multiplier for all of your ideas.  They've found six ways to make you a better communicator.      The Brothers Heath came from different directions in the study of what makes some ideas influential and memorable while others float in one ear and out the other, leaving nary a trace of their existence behind.  They've come together to with a clear idea of six specific characteristics that make some ideas hard to resist and hard to forget.    The six characteristics are easy to remember (as they better be in a book about making your ideas stick), easy to use and will truly improve your ability to communicate your ideas to others in written or verbal form.    I highly recommend this book for anyone who could benefit from learning to communicate their ideas more influentially to others.  That means all of us.
B0015UKX7E|5.0|This is my second rave dvd!!  Eye wore the first one out lol!  This is the best music concer ever,4 all  prince fans young or old!
0679736646|5.0|would be for this one.      This is a PKD masterpiece.  A strong convoluted story that, unlike many PKD novels, does not trail off but stays strong and sustained to the very end.      All the familiar pieces, played as well as he ever did.  Paranoia funny and paranoia very dark.  The besieged ordinary people of the future who have apartments (conapts, sorry) that know your credit history, doors that won't let you out unless you pay up in cash.  Who work for battling corporate giants selling the services of precogs or telepaths versus the services of 'inertials', those who can block the intrusive powers of the first.  A new element is that you can find yourself in 'cold-pak', at least if the cold-pak company gets to you soon enough after you die.  A twilight state of consciousness between life and death, in which your relatives can still visit you and talk to you through a speaker and headphones. The problem as it turns out is that it's hard to know, when you're in cold pak, if you're alive or not.
B00005JPO1|1.0|I was very excited to find a copy on the first day of its release. However, when the ending credits started to roll, all I could do was just sit there and shake my head in disappointment. It did not stand up to any of the last three films. The special effects were not real convincing, the plot surrounding aliens was an aggravated case of overkill and Harrison Ford's age is clearly shown. While the filmakers cannot prevent one from getting older, they should be able to tell when it is long past due to hang up the hat and whip. Just an overall bomb!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I was looking for this dvd for a while. I enjoyed watching again and thank you for your prompt service!
B00008RWC2|5.0|I got this book after seeing its companion, \\"Face Forward\\" in the library. Like \\"Face Forward\\", the book is a collection of photos of famous people made up to look like other famous people, with detailed descriptions of how it was done. This book has more basic makeup tips than \\"Face Forward\\" and is suitable for a beginner. I think it's a really good guide not just on how to apply makeup but also how to really use it effectively. I got it as a resource for my houseful of pre-teen daughters who will soon be using makeup. There are some male and transgender examples which might shock some people.
1596434252|5.0|Pop-up books don't work that well for children.  It is a rare child who can be trusted alone with one, and they all want to use them by themselves -- who wouldn't?  There is no coolness like the coolness of a pop-up book.  For someone who writes, they can be the avatar of the goal -- to have things leap off the page for the reader.    When you reduce what makes pop-up books amazing to the least common denominator, you have ABC3D. Here, magically alive, moving and turning and changing, are the operative agents of literature -- letters.  They have depth and shape.  They have character.      ABC3D makes you remember all over again how and why you first fell in love with words.  You can get it for a kid who's at that point in their life, and sit with them to enjoy it -- or you can get it for you.    Really. You can.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I watched this movie about six years ago and loved it.  I was excited to see it come out in Blu-ray and quickly jumped on it.
0316143472|1.0|Being an ardent Sedaris fan, I was prepared to be delighted by Sedaris' latest book \\"When You're Engulfed in Flames\\"; I was expecting a satirical feat, a notable achievement as is his usual custom.  What I got was a litany of aches, pains, ailments, and hypochondria of an aging man, getting older and sicker by the turning of every page, listing his illnesses, some real, some [perhaps] imaginary, from coughs, to cysts and boils, to gingivitis leading to gum surgery.  This book was a major disappointment; it's definitely not a buy, may be a library check-out.  Sorry David!
B00015YVDG|5.0|Ok, not too many times does a movie come along and have me wondering what the heck is going on.    RANSOM took me by surprise. Yes, it's a contrived \\"we have your kid, you want him back, you pay\\" plot and storyline. But, it's how it is played out that makes this movie good entertainment.    Now, no \\"fictional\\" movie is ever going to depict real life. But, suspend the \\"reality\\" for the movie and you go along for a wild ride. Tom Mullen (Gibson) is an airline executive, built the company from the ground-up, and will do anything to protect it. Kate (Russo) is his wife, who obviously has seen the ups and downs of their life, but has honored her \\"for better for worse\\" marriage vows. Then, they have a talented and bright child Sean (Brawley Nolte) who isn't too neglected and seems to have adequate child/parent time with each parent.    In what we should expect to happen, does indeed happen, the child is taken for ransom. But, it's in the how and the who that really grips us. He is taken from a public place which shows the kidnappers as thumbing their nose under everyone, and shows us we are too complacent in our feelings of security in public places, even during the day.     Det. Jimmy Shaker (Sinise) is the ring-leader, and I think his identity coming out sooner is to me part of the whole riddle and scheme of the movie, after all, he has no motive....well he does, but we will get to that later. He seems to be functionally insane. He can function in public, do his job and then he's a psycho on top of it all. How else can you do what he did??    After a botched \\"money drop\\" attempt, Mullen finds himself in a situation where he ponders \\"would paying the money really insure my son's safe return\\"? And he's right. We know it wouldn't. And he attempts to convince his wife that it's not about the money, it's about getting their son back alive. Once the kidnapper has their money, they have no reassurance if the boy will come back alive, which is the whole point behind paying theransom, now isn't it?    So... since it's all about money, why not turn it into a bounty? Which is what Mullen does. Who wouldn't turn in someone they know for $2 million? Which is what he is counting on, and Shaker didn't. Now Shaker has to keep calm (which he can't do, since his scheme is coming apart at the seems along with everyone he's around) and he's going beserk, while everyone else is trying to abandon the plan.    And Shaker doesn't like people \\"bailing\\" on him. Can anyone say \\"psycho\\"?     Shaker decides to give in, and gives the child back alive, killing all his co-horts in the process. But, it's when his greed gets the better of him he gets found out. Had he followed the plan, likely he would have been sipping margaritas in Mexico, but he had to have to money early and pays the ultimate price. Apparently his meds didn't kick in to save his brain or his life.      Yes, Mel Gibson might have over-acted as the father. But since it's fiction who are we to argue with that? I did enjoy the balcony scene where for a moment we thought he was going to jump. After all, he thought he'd killed his son. I was hoping he wouldn't jump, then again Shaker wouldn't have won either, but it didn't happen, which was a good thing.    Rene Russo was wonderful as the mother, she had a more realistic charm  in the role, but likely wouldn't have faired as well against Sinise.    Gary Sinise was wonderful in the movie as far as the crazy bad guy. He stands out more so in the movie since you're wondering what the heck set this guy off. He can play bad guys just as well as good guys (which is why I just love him in CSI: NY).    As Shaker is talking/rambling on, we realize one thing, the motive. He wonderfully explains his motive--he saw criminals everyday getting off by buying their way out of trouble. Mullen had recently done so with the Jackie Brown deal. Since Mullen didn't mind paying to stay out of jail/prison, then why not pay to get his son back?    Brawley Nolte did a wonderful job as Sean, and it does tug at your heartstrings to see how he was treated and then when he recognizes his kidnapper's voice.    Donnie Wahlberg did a wonderful job as the only friend the kid seemed to have in the whole ordeal, and made him a promise that was eventually carried out.    The rest of the cast were wonderful, and I wish I could remember all the actors in this movie.     The FBI were portrayed as neutral, they were trying to help the Mullens get their son back, while the father decided to take things into his own hands.  At least it stayed away from \\"the FBI saved the day\\" plot. The movie played out on it's own, and could have been directed by anyone. The cast seemed to compliment each other.     If you have DVR (and you're not paying any extra to record it), record it from a movie channel once, if you like buy it; if not, then save the money, and delete.    I for one, am going to get the DVD.
B000000OQ5|5.0|My buddies and I saw Tesla's first Detroit appearance backing-up Def Leppard at Joe Louis Arena in 1987. Def Lep was promoting the Hysteria album, as well as their back catalog. The stage was round, and it rotated at center ice. Tesla only had Mechanical Resonance to draw from, but they came out blistering with \\"Cumin' Atcha Live\\". We were absolutely blown-away with their stage presence and hard-rocking command of a live show. While Def Leppard was stellar, as well, Tesla was unforgetable. And they still are, today.  Get Mechanical Resonance. It will be in your Top 10 favorite hard rock CDs, for sure.
B0000667ES|5.0|I got this book after finding it in a library. I have a houseful of teenage and soon-to-be teenage daughters who are all very interested in makeup although they haven't started yet. It doesn't waste too much time with the absolute basics of applying makeup but is very useful on different \\"looks\\" and how makeup can be used to achieve desired effects. There are a couple of male and transgender makeup jobs which some might find shocking. For more practical advice on how to apply makeup I also got them his other book, Making Faces.
B000002JB3|3.0|Dance into the Light being Collins 1996 release and his 6th studio album and is an ok album. Collins seems to be running out of ideas on this album. The sound that made him famous in the 80's is not there. The lyrics are not as strong as one previous efforts. Dance into the light is a pretty good track but if one thinks of his past efforts it falls short. The book-let is atrocious. Collins looks odd to say the least. The clothes are so ugly.  The book-let is filled with odd photographs that look like some kid had fun with photoshop.  His rendition of the times are a-changin is alright but Collins version is nowhere as strong as the original. 3/5.
B00005JPO1|5.0|I was 1st in the door opening day for the first 3 Indy film.  I was unable to do this for this film.  The 1st film I waited to see since \\"Revenge of the Sith\\".  The last days of filming were done in my home town.    It is a very good film but is the least favorite of the 4 films to me.  Why?  Could the audience follow these searches or understand what the heck was going on?      Some of the script was not good.  How many of us got tried of Mutt & his old comments?  La  Beouf did NOTHING for me.    Great to have Karen back.  The script between Indy & Marion on their relationship needed work.  I think Cate did a great job in her role.    When a film starts out with the King that is good.  Still trying to figure out why Elvis's \\"Hound Dog\\" was not on the soundtrack CD.  They already had to pay you know a lot of money for use of the song in the film.    Jim Broadbent, an Oscar winner, used in a TINY PART to make up for the death of Denholm Elliott & the Marcus Brody role.    SEAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE FILM.    The DVD package.  Man, nice but MISTAKES.  1.  It is 1 of those you have to open 1 end to get the package/DVD's out the other side.  TOO MUCH WORK.  2.  No chapter search list.  3. No bloopers or deleted scenes    Good extras on it.   GUESS GEORGE WILL PUT THAT ON THE NEXT RELEASE OF THE FILM TO DVD.  YOU KNOW GEORGE, THAT WILL BE OUT IN A YEAR OR TOO.    I am glad Indy is back despite the mistakes.
B000002VCO|5.0|Ammonia Avenue was the Project's seventh studio album. It peaked at #15 on the charts & was the last Project album that cracked the Top 20. It had more charting singles than any other Project album. The songs that charted: \\"You Don't Believe\\" (#54 Hot 100), \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" (#15 Top 200), \\"Don't Answer Me\\" (#15 Hot 100) & \\"Prime Time\\" (#34 Hot 100). Ammonia Avenue could be considered the last album of Parsons early or classic era or it could be considered the transitional album before the late era. It's certainly the dividing line for the Project's impact on album or singles charts. Most of the usual suspects are here as lead vocalists: Eric Woolfson, Lenny Zakatek, Chris Rainbow & Colin Blunstone. surprisingly, there isn't a lead vocal by the bassist, David Paton.    Ammonia Avenue has a lot of good tracks, comes close to being the equal of Eye in the Sky. The album opens with \\"Prime Time\\", a very good song. It was unusual for the Project to open an album with a song that wasn't an instrumental. This changed with Ammonia Avenue. \\"Let Me Go Home\\" is about as close as the Project came to rocking out on a song. It's not what one would call hard rock but for the Project it is. Ian Bairnson provides an excellent solo proving, once again, he's an underrated guitarist. \\"One Good Reason\\" is another very good song. \\"One Good Reason\\" is a song that hints at the future direction the Project would embark upon. \\"Since the Last Goodbye\\" is a nice ballad but it might be the weakest song on the original album. That's not saying it's a bad song, it's not, it's just surrounded by so many good songs. \\"Don't Answer Me\\" has a pop sound, it's typical Parsons but that isn't a bad thing. There's a great sax solo in it performed by Mel Collins. \\"Dancing On a Highwire\\" is an adventurous song. Bairnson performs a very tasteful solo. \\"You Don't Believe\\" is one of the two best songs on the album, it has one of the catchiest choruses I've ever heard. \\"Pipeline\\" is the only instrumental on the original album. It's not the same \\"Pipeline\\" recorded way back in the sixties but Parsons is acknowledging a group that has been largely forgotten. But as far as instrumentals go, this isn't on the level as \\"I Robot\\" or \\"Sirius\\" but it has another great sax solo by Collins. \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" is reminiscent of \\"Silence & I\\" from Eye in the Sky. Woolfson's voice is particularly suited to this type of song.
B001H4PA6W|5.0|I'm writing this review right now while listening to this album and all I can say is WOW, anybody who is a Gojira fan will not be disappointed.  This is by far their best album to date as well as the heaviest sounding.  Again, WOW!!!
0375826726|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the eragon series since they first came out, and this installment was the best he has made yet. The story of eragon plays out in a more sophisticated style then some of the other books, yet I believe that Paolini has found his writing style in this book. I give 5 stars because it is now my favorite book
B000002IP1|4.0|But Seriously is Collins 1989 release and his 4th studio album and is Collins most political and socially concious albums so far. Even though I tend to dislike political music, Collins manages to write the themes without preaching and the approach is quite subtle and astute. Songs like Anaother day in Paradise and Colours are both social criticism and political statements. Collins does not abandon themes of love and relationships but sings with a greater maturity then he did on earlier records. Songs such as Do you remember and I wish it would rain down deal with such topics. The book-let is a mixed bag of very nice photographs but for some reason they went with a font for the lyrics which is quite tricky to read. A very cute picture of his son (I think so) lying as a baby on a bed. 4/5.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I have not seen this movie and thought about buying it ? What is with this movie being 4 to 5 dollars more than a normal new release ? Is George Lucas worried about gas prices or the economy ? Did this movie not make enough money already at the movie theater ? Are they trying to make up for the computer made Star Wars movie that flopped ?
0441013597|5.0|Having read this book nearly 20 years ago (right before I got married), I was recently thrilled to see it being reissued and propped up on a shelf at my local bookstore.<br /><br />The story of a desert planet without any viable source of water that held an empire together was sheer genius, and author Frank Herbert is to be commended for his insights into the human condition, including those associated with politics, geology, genetics, environmentalism, religion, and many other subtle aspects.<br /><br />Paul Atreides as the main character was fascinating to read about as he turns from boy to man to god (in the eyes of the fremen, the natives on Dune/Arrakis), and takes control of the most precious item in the universe: the spice melange. The spice extends life, consciousness, but comes at a terrible price: addiction.<br /><br />The great worms of Arrakis are a vital part of the ecosystem on Dune as they protect their areas of sand and are instrumental in the cycle of spice production.<br /><br />The feudal system was also an ingenious way to portray a futuristic society that has fallen back onto a path that could lead to stagnation and, ultimately, to the end of humankind.<br /><br />There's a lot more than this within these pages, too; something for just about everyone, and not just those with a predisposition for science fiction.<br /><br />This is my all-time favorite novel, and I'd forgotten how much I'd enjoyed it so long ago. Thanks to whomever is responsible for this reissue.<br /><br />Memories...
B0000844M8|5.0|We watched this superb movie with our children 35 years back and now are injoying it again with our grandchildren. In a time of too many action movies and movies with too much violance this film is an excellent way to bring some quiet into the home
0893860220|5.0|What makes this a particularly effective book is that Nisargadatta tells it exactly as it is after assessing each of the needs of those who approached him with their own issues.  He often did not mince words because he knew that only by being so direct would these people grasp exactly what he knew they needed to grasp.  Many other \\"gurus\\" aren't like that in the interest of being too \\"polite\\".  But not Nisargadatta.  His real talent or even genius was forcefully penetrating through the obstinate ego driven misconceptions as few others in history could do.  And even with his frequent directness, he just about always stresses to those with whom he engages in dialogue the necessity of sincerity in the practice of self inquiry(as manifested in the prescribed practice of \\"I am\\")[...]
B000002I8D|4.0|Face Value being Collins 1981 release and his debut solo album is an alabum that deals with very personal and heartfelt subjects. The song in the air tonight deals with betrayal and lost love. This must be love deals with newfound love and all that goes with that. Another great track is \\"I missed again\\". The book-let is very nice and simple. A close-up photograph of Collins looking pensive. The inside has all lyrics included and includes information of whom and what they played on the record. 4/5.
0393327655|4.0|What I liked most about this book was the discuss on religious moderates.  I once was a devout believer who took serious everything in the bible , it was quite an experience.  The deeper my devolution grew the more difficult it became to live in the real world.  I began to see satan in everything; education was evil because they taught evolution which contracted the bible; pop culture values demeaned the traditionalist lifestyle and even my parents rejected strict conformity to christianity.  I struggled mightily between rational understanding and religious practice,  and I was going insane.  I began judging others and myself in accordance to strict fundamentalist religiosity which caused difficulties in all my relationships and took me out of mainstream society.  This lifestyle had an enormous emotional and mental cost however I eventually came to the understanding the any belief in the supernatural is ill-rational.  The End of Faith makes the point that  religious moderates ignores these realities of dogma and in doing so support fundamentalism.  We now live in a time where radicals such as I was can access dangerous technologies to destroy cities for their apostasy, as a former militant evangelical I say this is something we all should be concern about.  It is my hope that this book furthers that consideration.
1416955070|5.0|If you love fantasy, this book is great.  It exists in a world filled with vampires, faeries, etc...and is greatly written. Its laugh out loud funny, and the end will surprise you.  (Unless you have read all of these reviews...because a lot of them give away the ending.)  I highly recommend it...its one of my favorites.
B00000768E|5.0|Along with The Bee Gees,ABBA are probably the only band that added some much needed panache to the questionable world of disco! Certainly the title track & 'Summer Night City' (included here as a bonus track) offer the listener disco with a touch of class.Bjorn has fun singing lead vocals on 'Does Your Mother Know' & 'I Have A Dream' is another highlight.The two standouts for me are 'Chiquitita' with it's multi-layered harmonies & the second bonus track 'Lovelight' (originally released as a b side to 'Chiquitita') with it's splendid chorus.    While 'Voulez-Vous' may not have the instant appeal of 'ABBA' or 'Arrival',it does stand the test of time & grows on you after several listens.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|After seeing the previews for Across the Universe I was instantly mesmerized and excited to see the movie.  I put it on my Amazon.com wishlist hoping that someone would buy it for me --anticipating the bright colorful scenes set along to Beatles music...after all, I'm a big fan of the Beatles and I like musicals.  I rented the movie from NetFlix, and within the first half-hour I was disappointed, but I stuck it out.  I thought that it must get better; I was wrong.  The dialoge was trite...almost like a joke.  After the arrival of 'Prudence' we get, \\"Where'd she come from?\\"  \\"She came in through the bathroom window.\\"  Yeah, we get it, it's a Beatles song.  The characters were *cutely* named after Beatles songs and frequently broke out into hokey melodies throughout the movie.  I like musicals, and I realize they get hokey at times, but this one just made me keep rolling my eyes.  The vocal arrangements of most of the songs were disappointing.  Some of the harmonies were nice, and I enjoyed the rocking versions by the Janis-Joplin-esque Sadie.  The storyline was shallow with serious lack of character development.  I might have liked this movie more when I was 12 and had lower expectations out of movies.    The best parts of the movie are the ones that are just musical/phychedellic visuals.  If these portions only had been paired with better vocal/instrumetal versions of the songs -with no attempt at having a plot-- it would have been better.      Instead, songs ended, cheesy dialogue resumed, and I was reminded each time that, 'oh yeah, there's supposed to be a plot here.'    Overall, this movie was disjointed and poorly executed.  The idea had potential.  Before I finished watching the movie, I had removed this flick from my Amazon.com wishlist because I honestly couldn't tolerate watching it again.  I'm surprised at the volume of 5-star ratings on here because the movie, to me, just wasn't that good.
031606792X|2.0|I enjoyed the first 2 books in this series, but Ms. Meyer seriously ran out of steam in Book 3.  I bought Book 4 just to see how the story ended.  Other negative reviewers have done a good job discussing the problems with this book, and the series overall, so I won't repeat those criticims.      My main issue is that great epics require the heroines and heroes to overcome great challenges, make choices, and make sacrifices.  Endings are not 100% happy.  If they were, what would be the point of the story?  Even in classic fairy tales and myths, the protagonists grow and learn through overcoming challenges and making sacrifices. Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, even Star Trek and Star Gate and Anne Rice's vampire novels demonstrate this.    In addition, the editing and publishing was poor (numerous grammatical and printing errors).  Way too much dialog.    *Spoilers*  This series is for young people, not adults, and the underlying themes were extremely disturbing, which other reviewers have covered:    Pedophilia, obsession, a woman having no life other than her man, etc.      Here is what I found annoying, as well, especially considering how much time and money I spent on reading and buying all 4 books:    1.  Why is Bella so attractive to all males?  We are never really told - we don't get a clear physical description, she is clumsy, antisocial, and puts absolutely no effort into her appearance.  Yet she is most beautiful (human) woman around?  Get real!    2.  I just don't know ANY woman who would be so uncaring about her appearance.  Even \\"tomboys\\" care about their appearance.  Bella expresses no interest in make up, clothes, shoes, her figure, etc.  This is completely unrealistic for a young woman who is supposed to be such a knockout.     3.  Bella is supposed to be a good student, even gets accepted by Dartmouth!  Pleeeeez.  She has absolutely no interests other than Edward, we don't know her GPA - no way would she get into an elite college.  The kids who go to elite colleges are driven to achieve in school, extracurricular activities, and typically have plans for what they want to major in and some career goals.  Bella is very ordinary in her academic career. (I went to one and am active in admissions, so trust me).  In fact, she's really a rather boring person.    4.  Edward is just too perfect.  No matter how much we love someone, in any relationship, we do become aware of our partner's flaws and love them anyway.  The classic romances are romantic because the partners love each other despite challenges and flaws and the story of the romance is of the relationship growing and evolving.    5.  Sorry, but Edward has \\"lived\\" 100 years.  Realistically, why would he enroll in high school and find a high school girl fascinating and his love object?  That's very unrealistic and/or disturbing on many levels.     6.  Bella never grows or develops on an emotional level, as far as I can tell.    7.  Finally, Edward being a virgin after 100 years?  LOL!  Ask any man if he were as gorgeous as Edward and had money, etc., if he would be a virgin after 100 years - that's hilarious.    Overall, a very disappointing end to a series that started out with great promise.
0765316897|3.0|Sanderson's greatest accomplishments may be his ability to create rich worlds that avoids the cliches of the fantasy genre.  From his standalone novel, Elantris, to the entire Mistborn trilogy, Sanderson continually surprises with innovations that capture the imagination.    The biggest complaint I saw about the earlier novels was the lack of secondary character development and it was well founded.  It's obvious that he listened and the work in the final book surpasses that of the previous two.  Sanderson has become a much more mature writer, working the characters and plot with equal care.    Despite this progress, Sanderson still has a long way to go.  A lot of the characters still feel like afterthoughts, thrown into the story without their true potential being realized.  Some of the pacing needs that little extra touch to take some of the awkward flow away.  And for such a promising, original series, the ending might be underwhelming to many.    I look forward to Sanderson's work down the road.  I had some trepidation after reading his first books, that he would be finishing the final novel in the Wheel of Time, but he has left me a lot more secure after reading The Hero of Ages.  Pick it up for a wonderful quick read.  It's good stuff, but his books down the road look like they could be great!
B001FBSMW6|5.0|When I heard that Keane were going to do quite a departure from their sound that we had all grown to love, I was somewhat apprehensive.  At the same time, however, my gut told me that they just might pull it off, due to the fact that Keane have demonstrated they are creative geniuses.  Well, I just picked up \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" yesterday and I fell in love with just about every song--on the very first spin of the CD.  I think too many people have bashed this album, complaining that Keane are trying to re-invent themselves as 80's retro pop-rockers.  All one needs to do, though, is listen closer and hear that Keane have not completely abandoned their old sound.  As a matter a fact, they have simply glossed over their familiar sound with an icing of 80's pop, and the combination works very well.  So, despite what some critics have said, this is a superb album that easily ties with \\"Hopes and Fears\\" and \\"Under The Iron Sea\\" and will not disappoint.
B000TGZPOQ|3.0|I bought this album not knowing what \\"Remastered\\" actually meant in terms of changes to the original works.  I used to own the original a long time ago and wanted to have it again.  At first I thought the tracks sounded slightly different, then I started to get real pissed off when I figured out that some of my favorite riffs and solos were completely changed.    This version is weak, and I wish I had paid more attention to what I was buying.  If you are looking for the original works, don't buy this version.
0312427999|5.0|Roll on Naomi Klein! I think she has hit the nail right on the head    When I was studying economics at Australia's Monash University between 1965 and 1969, our first three years were devoted to the study of the economics of John Maynard Keynes, a man with both heart and soul. Then in the final year, our Professor suddenly announced: \\"Forget all you have learned to date. We're now teaching the monetary theories of Milton Friedman.\\" I felt betrayed and abandoned.    Now, with the bailout of the banks, the tables are turned. Keynes was right  all along. The results of forty years of unmitigated corporate greed are now being exposed for all to see. It is only to be hoped that  America doesn't continue to gorge itself until, like Mr Creosote in the Monty Python movie The Meaning of Life, it explodes and leaves a disgusting mess for the rest of the world to clean up!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Been waiting for this BD version for a while. I have the HD-DVD trilogy  which was awesome. Before that had the 10 disc DVD version of the Ultimate Matrix Collection which was awesome.    The Blu-ray version is the best of them (except that it doesn't come with a Neo bust like the DVD edition did).    At the time of purchase and of writing this review the product info was wrong on the Blu-ray version. It claims it is a 10 disc set, when it actually is a 6 disc set, 4 Blu-ray's and 2 DVD's. I notified Amazon.com of this, but who knows when they will get around to fixing it.    Also it was said that this is a waste of money in another review because newer DVD players upscale.  However this person must have never seen an upscaled movie compared against a Blu-ray or HD-DVD version of the same.  There is a BIG BIG difference, I watch a lot of movies \\"upscaled\\" but all that does is allow you to watch a DVD movie on a HD TV, it improves the quality a little but not enough to say it is as good as Blu-ray or HD-DVD.    It is worth the extra bucks to buy one of greatest movies in the last 20 years in beautiful Blu-ray.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|After the initial joy of receiving the DVD a couple of days before shop release, I was wonderfully relieved at the 'movie' version of such a successful series.  All original cast involved, all questions are answered and true \\"sisterhood\\" fulfilled.  SJP and cast definitely get my vote. Girls, this movie is good for the soul.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|Dreamworks' got a clear winner in Kung Fu Panda. First of all you will fall in love with Po the Panda. And like those innumerable Kung-Fu films, where the unlikely character eventually trains and becomes the hero and fights to vanquish the enemy, Kung Fu Panda leaves no stone unturned in that pursuit. Nearly all the thrills of Kung Fu action, the beauty of comedy (what a fantastic script) and all other ingredients of an enthralling Kung Fu film like the wisodm of the masters, their super skills, training methodology etc., are carefully and beautifully delivered and the package even betters many chinese originals. The characters, the five superheroes, the villain and the masters were all well done. The movie is so very Chinese it is difficult to believe it wasn't from the Shaw Brothers.    As for color and animation I would give full marks. Many of the scenes are in beautiful dramatic colors particularly the Jade Temple scenes.    Don't know how many more hits (songs, movies) are going to be based on the \\"I believe\\" concept but it doesn't seem to grow or get stale.    My only complaint with Kung Fu Panda is that it was difficult to connect the voices of the stars with the characters including Jack Black's. Jack has a little nasal quality to his voice but it seemed to be totally absent. I had difficultly making out Dustin Hoffman's voice too. Until I read the credits it was difficult to make out the voices of the rest of the cast, like Angelina Jolie as the Tigress and Jackie Chan as the monkey or Lucy Liu as the Snake. Jackie Chan's voice is almost un-recognizable. He also had very little to speak in the movie.    Carl Douglas's hit of the yesteryears, \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" at the end reminded me so much of the Disco years. Wonder why no credit was given to Biddu, the guy who composed the music for the hit.    Go for the DVD. You won't regert. Can't wait for the sequel.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|James Hettfield's vocals are getting weaker and weaker.  He has never been a great vocalist but the great sounds of Ride the Lightning and Kill em all are GONE!  The guitar work is horrible.  They try to put multiple riffs in each song sans RTL and KEA but it sounds choppy instead of flowing smoothly from each riff.  These guys used to thrash now theyre just trash.  This album isnt worth .10 cents let alone 10 or 11 bucks.
0307265730|5.0|I LOVED this book.  I especially enjoyed the Hema & Kaushik triology.  Lahiri's writing just seems to flow with ease, and it's a pleasure to read.  I just love the way her stories unfold very carefully.  I actually liked this collection of short stories even more than Interpreter of Maladies.  It's the best book I've read in years.
031606792X|5.0|I really liked the whole series and I'm sad that it's over. I spent more time just reading and enjoying it than picking it apart like other reviews. What's relaxing about trying to find mistakes in the book instead of just reading?
031606792X|1.0|I read this whole series as my young teenage daughter and all of her friends are seriously obsessing about them.  I am still trying to figure out which age group the author and her editor (if she used one) really meant these books for!  It all starts out so Romeo and Juliet and then the whole thing falls apart.  The 18 year old getting married and skipping college and basically isolating herself from the entire world for a guy...what bold choices she makes...what dreams she chases.  Such an empowering message.  Afraid to get older than her stuck-at-17- boyfriend?    But the part that takes the cake in the age inappropriate award category is the whole get married so we can have sex, get pregnant, carry a baby to term under any circumstances (here the near or real death of the mother) and the incredibly messy yucky birth scene.  What young teenager wants to read this?  This is so out of touch with reality!    Stephanie Meyers started with such a good premise and an edge of your seat story...the ying and yang of the physical attraction (Jacob) versus the spiritual (Edward) and then proceeded to fall into a bottomless pool of ultra conservative Disney meets the vampire muck.  (She did go to BYU)    I truly believe in having conversations and not censoring garbage just because I don't like it, but how many of us have time to read what our kids are obsessing about?  Mothers should read this with their daughters and have a conversation about the choices women must make in their lives and other subjects touched upon in this series.  I have pledged to read (even if I just skim the sludge) with my daughter after this experience.  I watch her tv shows and movies to see what she is taking in...and Gossip Girl gives us a lot of interesting topics to talk about.  Yikes!  It's tough to be a parent these days!
B000PC6A3E|4.0|This movie is great, and the visual quality is fantastic, the sound is incredible, it's just all around awesome.  This, as the title implies, is the story about how batman begins, well, being batman. Very well worth watching, and you gotta see it before seeing The Dark Knight!
0446672653|5.0|I read this book within 24 hours.  I was so engrossed.  I wanted to know the outcome but, at the same time, I didn't want this book to end.  If you are a romantic then this book will tug at your heart strings but, also, if you are spiritual this book will take you on a wonderful learning journey.  I haven't read any other books by Dr Weiss, but now have a yearning to read them all.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Anyone who knows me, knows how big of a Batman fan I am. And even though this may sound biased, I can honestly say that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the best comic book adaptation movie ever made! With little nods and sideplots that only us deep Batman fans could recognize (i.e. the sonar spying system that Batman utilizes in the film that is ironically close to the Brother I satellite from the OMAC Project storyline in the comics ([[ASIN:1401208371 The OMAC Project (Countdown to Infinite Crisis)]]), or the Batman wannabe gang that mirrors Frank Miller's \\"[[ASIN:1563899299 Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]\\"), Nolan's \\"Knight\\" brings so much to the table that I can only think that the filmmakers achieved what Raimi so desperately tried to achieve with [[ASIN:B00005JPFH Spider-Man 3 (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], only they failed miserably; whereas Nolan and crew made a stunning success!<br /><br />There are so many plotlines in this film, which may make you think that the movie would become convoluted, but it doesn't. If anything, it keeps the audience involved with each and every character all the while keeping them on the edge of their seats, as there are plenty of nailbiting sequences in this film. The main plotline is Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) having to deal with the fact that his persona as Batman has inspired many new acts of criminality -- both seemingly good and extremely bad. Yes, Rachel Dawes is back too. Only instead of Katie Holmes, we now get Maggie Gyllenhaal. I was one of those few when the first film came out that didn't think Holmes' performance was all that bad, but, after seeing Gyllenhaal in this, I now realize how -- although not that bad -- truly stiff Holmes' performance was. And, much to Bruce's chagrin, Rachel's love interest is no other than the compassionate, idealistic District Attorney Harvey Dent (with a performance by Aaron Eckhart that may be the best of his career to date). Of course, Bruce has to deal with this relationship as well (continuing their relationship from [[ASIN:B0017HPHBM Batman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set)]]), all the while dealing with the newest criminal to grace Gotham's streets -- an anarchistic criminal who simply \\"wants to watch the world burn\\" and calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger). And the complicated relationship between Gordon, Dent and Batman (another comic book staple) is explored with great writing (again, taking a cue from their relationship in [[ASIN:1563894696 Batman: The Long Halloween]].<br /><br />Now, let me just take this time to say that I'm definitely not one of those people who believes much in an actor or actress receiving awards just because they've passed away or because they're so old and the academies believe they'll be passing away soon (Yes, Martin Landau, for his performance in \\"Ed Wood,\\" I'm directing that statement at him; his performance in that film didn't even come close to Morgan Freeman's in \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\"). However, regardless of Ledger's living status, I can truly say that he deserves an Academy Award for Supporting Actor nomination for his turn as The Joker, dead or alive. He is that good! Of course, being The Joker, he does have a few funny one-liners, however, unlike Jack Nicholson's Joker, Ledger's lines are so creepily delivered that you're not sure whether you want to, or should, laugh. And the complex relationship between The Joker and Batman -- one not being able to exist without the other -- that is a constant in the comics even to this day is added into the movie, which I was delighted about. Also, Ledger's Joker is always one step ahead of Gotham's police and Batman that he makes the perfect formidable foe that us fans know from the comics.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is also back as Lieutenant Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox; and all have good screentime and give great performances. Also, for those fans wondering, Cillian Murphy is also back for a brief cameo as The Scarecrow.The performances are all excellent but the true accolades should go to the writers, brothers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, and David S. Goyer. They wrote what a Batman movie should be and perfectly showcase why all of us fans love Batman in the first place: the dark, gritty realism peppered with hope and lots of cool gadgets. The fact that director Christopher Nolan has finally brought the cool respect that was lost by his predecessors back to the Batman franchise is superb! The action is plentiful but doesn't take away from the drama that is also needed for a film of this caliber.<br /><br />I liked [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)]] a lot, but The Dark Knight blows it and every other comic book-movie adaptation out of the water! I can only hope that there are more Batman movies planned for Nolan and crew, especially after all the money they've raked in (they broke the record for a midnight opening with $18.6 million, and that's not including any other showings; just the midnight ones)! Whether you're a comic book fan or not, I would recommend this movie! It's probably the best summer blockbuster I've seen in years! Immediately after seeing it, I wanted to see it again and felt bummed out that I couldn't. I won't write any more about the storylines or surprises in store as that would rob you of the full effect of the movie's greatness. Don't read any more into it. Just go see it and soak in the experience for yourself.all excellent but the true accolades should go to the writers, brothers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, and David S. Goyer.

B000JLSM00|5.0|I love this classic movie!   The colors look so cool on blu-ray disc. Because you can see better  detil than ever before.   John Ford makes really good movies.      So get it on Blu-ray or HD DVD today!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This will kick your butt...without a doubt.  Ive been running for years and have been doing the Power 90 and this DVD makes me feel like puking on a regular basis. I mean that in a good way. But seriously, I've gotten a lot stronger.  I recommend it highly for people who need to mix it up and who are in a rut.
B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast did a heck of a job creating one fun trippy album! This is classic Outkast and you cant hate on this awesome record they put out! Buy this!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|over 680 Reviews before mine.. . what more can I possibly say bout this album! Only that you wont find 80's Metallica here! Give em' a break guys, they're getting old! What you will find is a few good thrash riffs & good solos from Kirk! It's a reasonable album compared to \\"Post-Black Album\\" albums! Drums sound like signature Lars, \\"no St. Anger Snare here\\" Thank God for that! Its nice to hear Kirk's solos after so long!! Nothing Bad notable about this album.. other than the recording of the album, it sounds wayyy too \\"CRISP\\", like a couple of other reviewers have mentioned! About the songs.. They are a lifesaver after the disastrous St. Anger. The Day That Never Comes is a great first single, That Was Just Your Life & Broken Beat & Scarred, are great tracks. End of the Line kinda reminds me of Sad But True, only Faster!! All Nightmare Long would be a highlight here! All songs on this cd are average to good, though my first impression, when I saw Unforgiven III in the track list was like..  are these guys desperate?!?! But the song tends to grow on you. I rated this album 4 because I think it's a decent album after all these years!! Better than all the other wannabe metal core crap!
015206396X|5.0|After reading several books lately that I was not pleased with, it was incredibly refreshing to come upon this one. The plot was fantastic, and slightly terrifying at one point, considering the realization that there are people in this world who have immense power to do really horrible things to many innocent people.<br /><br />I found Katsa to be an entirely motivational character. It's great to see a female character who can hold her own, and not become a ball of mush the moment a gorgeous man comes into her life. There was romance, yes, and I loved it because it wasn't sappy and cheesy, but quite interesting and believable. It's the type of romance you're not likely to see in many stories, and I'm surprised at how well the author pulled it off.<br /><br />The action was well written and so were the characters, which is a big deal for me because I'm huge on character development. Very early on in the book I felt as if I could completely see these characters as real people, and I loved that.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down, and I definitely didn't want it to end, even though it was nearing 500 pages in size. I look forward to reading any other books by this author, and I'll definitely be praising this one to anyone who is willing to listen.
1402210795|4.0|I don't know why or how, but somehow I managed to go 27 years without reading Georgette Heyer.  Thankfully, that has been remedied.  Friday's Child was the first book of Heyer's that I picked up, and it sold me on all of her others.    Heyer's writing is so much fun.  There were times when I laughed outloud.  The book is obviously well-researched and manages to pull off the jargon of the time-period without it sounding forced.  The characters are really well-done.  It is amazing how much emotion they illicited from me.  First I hated them for being dumb, then I pitied them, then I loved them.  Heyer was a true story-teller.  I am in awe!
0152048049|5.0|this is one of my favorite stories.  I read it as a child and enjoyed it, re-read it as a teenager and understood more of the symbolism, then as an adult, of course, understood even more of the meaning. Everyone could get something from this story.

0061122416|5.0|This book (The Alchemist) was a gift to honor a friend. I had originally found out about it from one of my daughters who asked me to read it and pass it on to another daughter. I highly recommend it, and look forward to reading other books by this author.
B000005JA8|5.0|The cause of this bickering seems to be the disconnect between what this record is and what people seem to think it is. This record was and still is quite impressive because:  1) It was able to very accurately predict the attitude and aesthetic of 80's post punk.  2) It was a pop/rock record on the same label as Alice Cooper that has a very convincing and unforced free-jazz motif.  3) The lyrics are very literate and complex by any standards.  4) Even after legends like Orange Juice, Wire, Joy Division and the like, it still holds up as one of the standouts in the minimalist art-rock genre.    Many people, both those claiming this is the best and those claiming this is the worst record ever, seem disproportionately bewildered by its contents. Yes, it is strange, even disorienting. But a healthy dose of post-punk, avant garde jazz, or pretty much any of the artier genres will quickly put this record into a more sensible perspective.   Trout Mask replica is an excellent record, but go in understanding what it is.

0060005696|5.0|All the information in this book rings true and a great read for those who want to simply and know that the perfect choice is not always the one that makes us the happiest if you spend all your time dwelling on finding it.  If you spend a lot of time making decisions you may want to consider picking up this book.  You won't be disappointed. Nice read.
1416562605|5.0|This book was deep but I read it slowly over time and really enjoyed it. In fact I hated for it to end. I could have kept reading for the rest of the year. I like the tone and style of writing from Adiga. There is lots going on here and lots of hidden meanings but I would say overall that it is a philosophical novel that covers a lot of societal issues. Probably not for the shallow reader looking for mind candy, but great for someone looking for depth. It is a book to get engrossed in. Would make a nice gift for that intellectual.
0226264017|5.0|A fantastic piece of literature. The concise nature of the book belies the depth of knowledge and purpose of Friedman's writings, but then that is what he intended. I find I take more out of the book each time I read it. A must for any serious economist and to any one willing to gain a clearer picture of the political economy and the forces at play.  Do yourself a big favour and read this and if are a socialist then be warned, the truth will hurt! (If Mises's work has not already done that)
B001FW2R5I|5.0|Like many others, I first heard Keane's single \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" on the radio four years ago and I was hooked. The song wasn't nearly as mature or well-developed as some of Coldplay's music from the same time (like \\"Politik\\", \\"Warning Sign\\" or even \\"The Scientist\\"), but I heard some real potential (ignoring some critics who dismissed Keane as mere Coldplay-imitators). This potential I believe is fully realized in their latest album Perfect Symmetry (released October 14th). It is the next phase in their evolution since Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea and is no longer likely to be confused with aforementioned English rockers.    Songs like \\"Spiralling\\" and \\"Better Than This\\" are both immediately accessible and musically complex and surprising. The vocals are especially fun (if you like the unexpected as much as me) - some oddly enough remind me of Freddie Mercury, I'm not really sure why... I think in the past, Keane's slow songs have had a hard time catching on with the public (like \\"She Has No Time\\" or \\"A Bad Dream\\" - both songs I enjoy, but they're easily lost with other nondescript titles like \\"Try Again\\", \\"Sunshine\\" or \\"Bedshaped\\"). Though the song titles may still leave room for improvement, the music plays to the band's strengths with clever, moderate-to-quick tempoed songs that are marvelously long (most of the tracks break 4 minutes). My vote for the highlights are \\"Time To Go\\", \\"Perfect Symmetry\\", \\"Again and Again\\" and \\"Spiralling\\", but this really is one of those albums where you should just buy the whole album if you're a Keane fan (or if you're not, there's no better time to become one).

0380730405|5.0|Rebecca is a book narrated by a girl just barely out of her teenage years. In spite of that, it's a book for adults, too. The poor Mrs. De Winter is thrown into a whirlwind of society and class with which she's completely unfamiliar. She's suddenly expected to be beautiful, classy, and clever right off the bat. Du Maurier excellently portrayed Mrs. De Winter's thoughts throughout the novel. Even though they never mentioned her first name, Du Maurier still was able to sculpt the heroine into a lovely character.<br /><br /> I never once had to force myself to read this book. The suspense to see what would happen next had me reading whenever I could pick up the book. Just when I thought things were settling down, some new twist would have me reading with my nose practically touching the paper. I couldn't set it down!<br /><br /> The characters were anything but black and white. They were more detailed then any non-biography books I've read. Sometimes, I'd be turned around and be irritated with the protagonists and sympathizing with the villains. The villains were well developed as well, not just the normal  brute force `I kill you now', but they're sly and deceitful, and you can never see their next blow until it was too late.<br /><br /> Now that I've praised the characters completely, I actually do have one critical thing to say about Mrs. De Winter. It annoyed me that she was so groveling. She just allowed everyone to walk all over her, and she didn't say a word about it. It would've been nice for her to have been able to stand up to someone at least once before the climax.<br /><br /> But that didn't detract severely from Rebecca. There were more than enough things to make up for it, and it was a good read anyway. I recommend this book to teenagers and adults alike.
B001HDYK6Y|2.0|... I hate to type this. This disk makes me want to buy a pair of leg warmers, some high-tops and a giant bottle of LA Looks hair gel and return to my childhood. The last song is good (along with one or two somewhere near the middle), and I understand the 80's are back musically, but the electronica beat seems a bit crazy as every song is totally overwhelmed by it. Perhaps it would sound better on a boom-box.
B001E75QGG|5.0|Just a quick word about the Blu-Ray version. I have seen a lot of Blu-Rays, and the PQ can really be hit or miss. Some are weak others are great. This one is among the best I have seen. It has a clear, sharp picture throughout. No grain. The colors are sharp and true. The details are sharp. The sound is Dolby surround (no DTS, unfortunately) and is excellent. This is a demo-quality Blu-Ray. You can use to show your friends how outstanding Blu-Ray can be. It is that good.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Haunting, complex, driving, melodic....everything you expect from PT and more. I highly recommend this album, and ANY album by this band.

B0010X745K|5.0|THE MIST was a terrific short story (ok, a \\"novella\\") that seemed impossible to make into a movie at the time it was written (the early '80s). Due to King's various creatures slithering, buzzing, or towering above like walking skyscrapers, I figured a movie would never materialize. Thank God for Frank Darabont! He uses just enough cgi to keep things interesting. After all, the hideous monsters in the mist are only as frightening as the  human monsters that emerge during the invasion. The folks trapped in the grocery store become their own worst enemies, nearly dooming themselves without much help from any titanic terrors! Marcia Gay Harden (The Dead Girl) is perfectly twisted as the bible-waving Mrs. Carmody. Mr. Drayton (Thomas Jane) tries logic, common sense, and other such useless tools in a hopeless attempt to reason w/ the unbalanced prophet, who soon gathers a group of mindless followers! So, while an army of creatures lumber about outside, the humans fight an epic battle of wills inside. Very well done. Yes, the ending is different from the book. It's also a dark, merciless finalé to this tale of building dread. So, if you can only handle happy endings, you might want to watch YOU'VE GOT MAIL again instead...  P.S.- I liked all the characters in this. Laurie Holden (Silent Hill, tvs X-Files) is especially good...
1572814136|4.0|Although I'm new to tarot cards I wanted to purchase first the Rider deck. I was looking for the normal deck but then I saw this beautiful colored Rider-Waite. The colors are so alive that it gives you a warm feeling that you have a special deck in your hand.    The brightness of the cards make this deck more powerfull than the normal deck. The symbolic view of the cards are the same as the original (being just a slightly modified copy). I suggest that anyone who wants to buy his first cards of tarot deck should do it either on Rider-Waite or on Thoth Deck. Being new to tarot I've also discovered the connection between the kabala, astrology, numerology,zodiac and many others. I've started to study these lost forms of art.     Even if you want to impress your girlfriend with your new asset, giving it as a gift to somebody, wanting the learn the proper way of living in this modern day to day life, wanting to learn the ancient secrets and the meaning of all that's about life this is a good choice. You'll not regret it.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|Received item quickly as usual for items bought from Amazon.  This item completes the set of three(1st season-yellow,3rd season-red).  At just under $60 shipped to my door, this is easily half the price of buying the same thing in one of the big retailers.  I love this item as I do the other two seasons. Excellent quality that will last forever.
0373771665|5.0|Georgette Heyer has a finite number of character templates. Her heroines come in ingenue, fiesty, and maternal. I like them all, but the maternal ones resonate most with me. Oh, they're not mothers, of course, but they are the older sisters of dependents. They have usually sacrificed their own best hope of getting out of Dodge to take care of their younger sibs, and they are, on the whole, not inclined to whine about it. Venetia is orphaned, her older brother never appears in the book, and she has been taking care of her younger brother all her life. Poor Venetia!<br /><br />Fortunately, there is A Rake. The heroes also come in standard varieties including Rake, sober and underrated young man, and fops. There are, as there must be in any book, Tribulations. And as it is a romance novel, there is a happy ending. Along the way, she offers to build a willow cabin at his gates, except it is November, so she'd rather not. It's a very erudite wooing. In the end (and I had missed this all the previous times I'd read this), they agree to an open marriage, where she will preside over his orgies. Really. I love you, Georgette.

B000GDH9JQ|5.0|This movie has the best dancers ever! A dancer tries to leave the USSR after a plane crash but they want to force him to stay to dance in the country. His roomates want to leave with him after they find out the wife is pregnant. Excellent movie I used to watch this movie over and over again as a child and now that I have it on DVD I'm sure I will again!
B001FBSMW6|3.0|First, I actually give this 3 and a half stars.<br /><br />I am a huge Keane fan, but was somewhat horrified after hearing 'Spiralling' as the first single. Parts of the song are great, but I can't get over the 'Oooooo' that riddles the song.<br /><br />There are only a handful of songs on this CD that I really care for; 'Perfect Symmetry' is pure Keane genius, emotional and powerful; 'You Don't See Me' is also nothing short of brilliant; 'The Lovers Are Losing' offers hook after hook, and right now is my favorite song on the album; 'Love Is The End' offers a nice closing to the CD w/some very thoughtful lyrics and melodies; 'Black Burning Heart' is def. starting to grow on me too....<br /><br />And while I admire the fact they wanted to change their direction, personally it doesn't really work for me; Most of the other songs sound like 80's influenced pop or even some of their own weaker B-sides from the previous albums.<br /><br />The production is pretty amazing, and they all sound like they are musically in top form; Tom sounds fantastic, and the group has done a decent job of establishing a new path.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this CD, and I would have to say I am a little disappointed after waiting 2 years for something new. It's not a bad CD by any means, and I'm sure some songs will grow on me given the chance; New fans might latch onto this right away, but much of the newer material is too much of a departure for me.
1932100660|5.0|Very informative book based on broad, long-term scientific studies about diet and health. Eye-opening results fly in the face of conventional, money-driven ideas about what a healthy diet includes. Diseases of civilization (heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity,etc.) are shown to result from dietary choices, and can be reversed by improving diet. Guidelines for health steer towards vegetarianism, with clear foundation from the numerous studies cited earlier. Problems with \\"scientific\\" method because of money and peer pressure, giving out false conclusions and distorted facts to public, related.    This book helped me firm up my desire to eat more plant foods (fruits, vegetables, etc.) in their most unrefined (raw) state. Not only can I avoid disease and improve my own health, but I am passing on this information (book) to my own adult children so that they can make more informed nutritional choices for themselves and their children.
067003830X|5.0|This is such a revelation. The book is so easy to read.  What an amazing brain we have been given.  I marvel the older I get at Gods' wonderful creation and how he made us.  And we are learning this with these sorts of discoveries.  A great book and so very easy to read and understand.  Thank you.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Anything I could say about the many merits of this movie has already been said. But a couple caveats: The movie trailer does not capture the true feel of this movie. The movie is not as dramatic (or fast paced) as the trailer leads one to believe. It has a little camp in it, which simply adds to the movie's deep layers...while the story is told by an adult, it is projected onto the screen through the child's eyes and mimics the acting style of the era in which the movie is set. Also, the movie is meant only to be seen on a big screen in a dark room. While this holds true for most (some would say all) movies, I've never before regretted having missed a movie in the theater.
B001E7X4M4|5.0|Plain and simple, if you're a fan of Unearth then pick up this album.  Every song is great.  My Will Be Done starts the album off the right way with an amazing intro.  Currently listening to Cutman as I write this, and the middle of the song is amazing as well.  Anyways, quit reading this review and buy the album.
B001E75QGG|1.0|I loved the original Indiana Jones movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Its one of my all-time favorites.  The series has been a wreck since then.  The Crystal Skull installment is possibly even worse than the awful Temple of Doom episode that was dragged down by Kate Capshaw and that little twerp \\"shortround\\".  In this case, its the horrible story (thanks to George Lucas) and the stiff performance by Harrison Ford that dooms this movie.  Neither one of these guys has done anything worthwhile in over a decade.  Steven Speilberg doesn't do much better with his unimaginitive direction.  He goes through the motions in a lame attempt to copy the previous movies.  The gag lines are poorly conceived and delivered and as a result that fall flat.  There isn't even a compelling villain.  A complete disappointment.
B001FBSMW6|2.0|I have been a huge Keane fan from the piano rifts of Hopes and Fears to the fairy tale world of Under the Iron Sea.  The imagination and amazing talent this band has at making beautiful music is beyond belief!  Now I've probably listened to each of those CDs 50x each.  That being said, the piano which made the band has become woefully inadequate; replaced by cheap sounding synthesized reverbs.  The reason I loved this band in the first place is because they made such good music with such an organic sound.  This is replaced in Perfect Symmetry with noise... like another review said \\"bad 80's sound.\\"  Don't get me wrong, artistic license is what makes so many albums jewels, but this just isn't that, or even close.  It's like they tried to hard or maybe didn't try at all... I don't know?  You know sometimes that an album is just weird sounding and that it will probably grow on you over time.  This is not that album...more like a bust... hopefully sales will be bad enough that they will return to the roots!    I was filled with anticipation when I downloaded \\"Spiralling\\" the first day it was released.  The sound was very different, very electric funk.  It was good though.  The lyrics were strong and deep even though they take the typical shots at Bush and the Iraq war (this is coming from a conservative American who can enjoy good music even if I cannot understand some of the positions bands take Muse being another example of this).  So when I began to listen to the album I went in with a very open mind to changes in style.  From another universe was all I could think!  However disturbed and depressed after after the first four tracks of the cd I became, I am very happy I listened to the whole thing.  There were a few jewels in the rough and I was sweating bullets until my bleeding ears were assuaged with the with the choruses of Perfect Symmetry, Again & Again, Playing Along, Black Burning Heart, and Love is the End.      Again and Again has a classic Keane tempo and beat, refreshingly old Keane combined with their new sound.    Playing Along was mixed very well.  The rising climax, the blasting crescendo, and the slow vacuum of sound to silence at the end make it very artistically unique and wonderful.    Black Burning Heart is a song that makes you want to cry because the lyrics are so biting, tragic, and true of all of us but made so beautiful with the music.  Sans the french, this song is one of my favorites as far as the lyrics go...      Love is the End: a lovely, touching, I want to die staring into your eyes love ballad fit to end all time.      Now the thesis here is not that Keane has lost its touch, just that this is not worthy of being called an album.  It is an arrangement of 5 or 6 good songs mixed in with some weird sounding electric noise which I will pretend was just good intention and artistic touch gone wrong and never to be heard from again on their next album.  Can't recommend this album to a Newbe... Spend your clams on the last two albums.  For a die hard fan; hold your head up... they're sure to do better next time (just enjoy the few diamonds in the rough)!
B000002KK2|5.0|This is an exceptional album, something one would expect of an established ,eperienced and mature, elder artist, not a fresh , young 23yr old.   To be 23yrs old, and make a debut album of this caliber is simply  astonishing. It has everything  a listener could want and it has it in spades:         a.Well crafted songs with great story lines and characters       b.Brilliant musicianship.....listen to that funky bass in  the song Young Blood, or the romp in Danny's All Star Joint, or the groove in Weasel and the White Boys Cool.        c. Emotion.....the opening notes on the piano in track 2 is enough to make one cry.....or the lament in the song Company......I have actually at times found this album hard listening as it can be so emotive.       d. A great singer, with an original style....RLJ is not afraid to be just hersself, she doesn't try to be like anyone else or sound like anyone else.     Walter Becker is reported to have been hugely impressed, when later producing one of her future albums, by her spontanaety and simplicity in her approach to recording her albums, and indeed , it reportedly was a revelation to him after the endless repitition in the Steely Dan recording sessions.     That spontaneous, simple approach is evident here in an album  that is emotive, warm ,sincere, fun, but also sophisticated without being interllectual or pretentious.   Nearly 30yrs after its debut it is still great listening, fresh, enjoyable and relevant.   Highly recommended.....    Oh, and um, hats off to the reviewer who titled his review Doyt, Doyt, Doyt......well done! Its in reference to a sort of scat that RLJ does in the song Young Blood...its brilliant ...that alone is reason enough to buy the album!

B001CTA1T8|4.0|Even with all the hype and not expecting a good film, Beverly Hills Chihuahua is wonderful, delightful and funny.  I call it a modern day Lady and The Tramp.  After reading one review on Amazon about how sad, implausible, etc..I wondered what the viewer really wanted and that maybe he/she had been damaged earlier in life by sweet, dog loving, sad but good ending movies.     It's a dog lovers movie and a very good kids movie with plenty of \\"life lessons\\".....just like all Disney dog movies.  Hooray for Disney.  How else would little children learn about dogs and love and life and loyalty.  Animation (dogs talking) done very, very well.  I'm 59 years old and I've not seen a sweeter movie in years.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|Like some of the released live works of the Doors in the past decade, this show more than others pushes the argument again for the survival of Jim Morrison. When the studio releases in 1971,or so, \\"Absolutely Live\\" and claims Jim was drunk most the time etc., they had to splice shows...etc as the official story and 30 years later there are a dozen shows to come that are not incoherent or uneven, one wonders. This was a hot show, my beautiful friend, with 3 unreleased songs and the fullest display of Morrison's range from blues, rock to Sinatra vocal touches. Manzarek's and Krieger's support throughout was inventive, jazzy and extraordinary. What made this special is the surprising counter taunts by Morrison when the audience tires of the artsy \\"When the music's over\\" interlude and Jim breaks the trance with two or three bird calls straight out of Martin Denny's \\"Quiet Village,\\" that no reviewer had yet identified. The seamless segueing into and out of formal song structure was amazing. New levels of improvisation, here. No 4 chord wonders, absolutely surprising 40 years on.
1433502410|5.0|In a day when most Christians have taken the concept of Sola Scriptura to mean \\"solo scripture\\" where everyone appears to interpret Scripture anyway that is convenient to them without regard to background, interpretation through 2000 years of history or scholarship, the ESV Study Bible is a Godsend.<br />I have been counting the days for the arrival of the ESV Study Bible since I found out about it late this Spring, and I am not disappointed. The scholarship of the notes match and sometimes surpass the notes in the Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible  or The New Interpreters Study Bible.  The introductions answer the critical questions raised by modernists very nicely, and the detailed notes are supported with historical facts, archaeological findings and logical thinking.  Theologically, the positions taken in the notes are consistent with interpretations held by Christians for hundreds of years and do not support wild speculative theologies that have cropped up in the last 150 years. At the same time it not dogmatic about minor issues and differences that Christians have had for 2000 years.<br />The editors have however, included in introductions and articles, some speculative theologies that cannot be supported from Scripture, but the notes are consistently to the point. This is true even in the notes for the book of Revelation where these kinds of issues usually crop up. The commentaries on the gospels follow a traditional, historic understanding of the Gospel.<br />The only thing which would have made this excellent resource even better would have been more discussion on the scholarship that has developed over the years, including the pastoral epistles, dating of Revelation, etc. For example, no mention is made of the strong internal evidence for a pre-AD 70 date for the book. Surely an event such as the destruction of the Temple that would have been equivalent to the 9/11 attack and would have been recorded by the author of Revelation. A discussion on that would have been nice.<br /><br />The online bible access is a big plus, and it appears that it will also be available in software program soon with an announcement forthcoming on which program or programs are going to have it.<br />For those of us who are visually challenged, the font size is quite acceptable and is an improvement over the some of the other study bibles that I have.<br /><br />As a lay person, I find this study bible to be very best and it will be used along with other study bibles (Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible, New Interpreters Study Bible, NIV Study Bible, Reformation Study Bible, Harper-Collins Study Bible) in order to help me understand what was said, why and its implications for my life today.<br /><br />Update:<br />After having used this study bible for a while, I must add a couple of statements: There are some places where the notes major on minors and minor on some major items.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|Ok, I'll start this review by saying that this album is NOT a typical Priest album... I mean, its very different from their other albums and that's the main reason why some people don't/won't like it.    Now, is the fact that it sounds different from Priest's other albums a bad thing? In my opinion, it isn't. I've always been a big fan of epic music and Nostradamus is one of the most epic albums I've ever heard. Yeah, the music on this album is very epic and its also very melodic, in fact, Nostradamus is probably Priest's most melodic album.    Anyway, lets talk about the songs now. I'll skip the interludes because they are pretty useless, I mean, they aren't bad at all, but I usually skip them unless I feel like listening to the album all the way through.     First CD:    The first song, Prophecy, is one of the best songs on the album, it reminds a bit of Angel Of Retribution, it has a great main riff that is used during the verses and the chorus, the pre-chorus is quite dark and I like it and the chorus is good, but its not one of the best choruses on the album. The next song, Revelations, is even better, the verses are very epic and I love them, the song is very epic and symphonic overall (but so is most of the album). War sounds more like an interlude than a real song, but its a great one, it does sound like a war song, the chorus is very dark, but its not very original, I mean, the riff during it is the typical dark metal riff (you'll understand what I mean when you'll listen to it). After that, we have Pestillence And Plague which is a favorite of mine, a lot of people don't like the chorus because its in italian, they think its cheesy, but personally, I think that its one of the best choruses on the album, its very epic and Rob Halford's vocals during it are great. Next is Death, its quite forgettable, but it has a few great parts, the riff at 2:12 really reminds me of Death (the band), I mean, in terms of harmonies (I'm sure that Death fans will get what I mean)... The part at 5:12 is the best part for me, the synth sounds great. Conquest starts with a pretty catchy riff and like Pestillence And Plague it has a very epic chorus. The next song, Lost Love, is the first ballad on the album and its definitely a great ballad! Its very soft, but its simply beautiful. I'm not a big fan of ballads, but this one is very good. The first CD ends with Persecution which is the heaviest song on the CD, its good, but to me its one of the weakest songs on the first CD... Its one of the songs that sound the most like typical Priest, but you know what? I prefer the epic sound of the other songs.    Second CD:    In my opinion, the second CD is nowhere as good as the first one. Actually, it mostly consists of ballads. The first song, Exiled, is good, but its nothing special really... The next song, Alone, is MUCH better! Actually, its one of the best songs on the album, its a ballad, but like Lost Love from the first CD, its a great one and it has a really memorable chorus (one of the best on the album). Visions is one of the first songs that we all got to hear, when I first heard it, I thought that it was average and I still think that its average... Like Persecution from the first CD, it sounds quite a bit like a typical Priest song, but its simply nothing special, the chorus is very generic... Next, we have, in my opinion, the weakest song on the album, New Beginnings. It isn't bad, but its very forgettable, its just a very average ballad. The title track starts in a very epic way, a lot of people don't like the intro, but personally, I love it! Anyway, its one of the heaviest songs on the album, the riff under the verses really remind of the main riff from Painkiller (which can be a good thing or a bad thing) and the chorus is quite catchy. The last song, Future Of Mankind, is one of the best songs on the second CD, its very epic and the chorus is not overly original, but I love it!    Now lets talk about the musicians. I've never really cared about Rob Halford's voice except when it goes very high, but I have to admit that I like his voice on this album a lot, he doesn't sing very high as much as on the other albums, but his voice is very poweful! We all know that Tipton and Downing are great guitarists, I've always loved their solos, but I must say that I'm quite disappointed with their playing on this album... Tipton's solos have always been very memorable, but his solos on this album are not very memorable. A lot of the riffs aren't really incredible either... I mean, the album has a few great riffs, but the riffs are not what make the album good (the melodies are)... Oh well, to add some positive, a couple of the songs have very cool melodic (melodies, harmonies, ...) sections. Scott Travis is a great drummer and I guess that he's great on this album, but I don't know much about drumming... Ian Hill, well, he's Ian Hill. Last, but not least, the orchestration/keyboard/synth on this album is one of the best things about it! A lot of people think that Judas Priest and orchestration don't go together and maybe they're right, but without the orchestration/keyboard/synth, this album wouldn't be anywere near as good as it is. Its an epic album, it needs orchestration. Seriously, do you really expect an epic album to consist of guitar, bass and drums only?    What about the lyrics? Well, honestly, they aren't bad, but they aren't great either, they're quite cheesy, but lyrics have never been Priest's strong point. Personally, I don't really care about them... Yeah, I realize that the album is a concept album, but the music is great, so I don't really mind the lyrics.    So, overall, Nostradamus is a great album. Its obviously not Priest's best album, but, for me, its better than Rocka Rolla, the overrated British Steel, Point Of Entry, Turbo, Ram It Down, Jugulator, Demolition and Angel Of Retribution. Like I said earlier, its not a typical Priest album, its more epic than heavy, but who cares? Just accept that Priest tried something different. Listen to it with an open mind like I did, don't expect a second Painkiller.    Best songs (in no specific order): Prophecy, Revelations, Pestilence and Plague, Conquest and Alone.    Weakest songs: Visions and New Beginnings.
B001B71NOI|4.0|Well after the daydreaming record Ghosts I-IV, NIN gave us again the power we are used to hear of them, the difference, now Trent is doing it in independent way, with any record label involved, but wait, the quality of music remains incredible, the art is amazing, in this limited edition pack you can find a CD and DVD with the rehearsals with the new members of NIN, and really worth the price, so if you dont have it go and get one, there are only 250,000 copies, just 10 songs, but every second of every song is an amazing experience, so thank trent for giving this album for free, but the art of the record make me bought the physical one, awesome.
B00005K9LN|2.0|Judas Priest is one of the most famous metal bands, a lot of people consider it to be one of the best metal bands ever... Are they right? Of course! British Steel is one of the most famous metal albums, a lot of people consider it to be one of the best metal albums ever... Are they right? In my opinion, they aren't. Personally, I consider this album to be one of Priest's worst and one of the weakest famous metal albums. Besides, I don't really consider it to be a metal album, it sounds more like hard rock to say the truth.    This album is extremely overrated. I can't believe that Priest went from awesome albums like Stained Class to this only 2 years later... They went from awesome metal songs with great riffs to simple hard rock songs with average riffs. I fail to understand why so many people consider it to be Priest's best album. My guess is that most of those people prefer 80's mainstream hard rock over 80's metal.    The bad:    The songs on this album are so ridiculously simple... Most of them have only 4 riffs in total and those riffs are nothing special compared to most of Priest's riffs from the 70's. Ok, there's nothing wrong with simple songs, but the songs aren't only simple, they're also nothing special or in other words, they aren't like most of Priest songs from the 70's. Breaking The Law is so overrated, I used to like it, but I got bored of it fast... Some people think that it has an awesome chorus, but what's so awesome about it exactly? Its one of the least melodic choruses ever! Just say 'breaking the law' 8 times and you have the chorus. Living After Midnight is pretty catchy, but its just a generic and cheesy rock song... Ok, I guess that it wasn't generic in the 80's, but its just a very average song. United has a catchy chorus, but that's it. You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise and Steeler are extremely forgettable.    Did I mention that this album has some of Priest's weakest solos? Now I did. I guess that I should also mention that its oneof their least melodic albums.    The good:    The best song on the album is definitely The Rage. Its actually a great song, it has a cool intro, a great main riff (the best riff on the album) and the verses are pretty catchy (the best verses on the album). Rapid Fire, Metal Gods and Grinder aren't bad either, but damn, they're really nothing special, they're really simple, there's nothing really original about them and they aren't anywhere near as good as most of Priest's songs from the 70's. I know that I'm repetitive with that, but it has to be said.    So, its 50/50, half of the album is very average and the other half is just good. There's nothing really bad on this album, but there's nothing awesome either, its just very average overall.    Now, I have a question... How can anyone prefer songs like Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight over songs like Exciter, Beyond The Realms Of Death, Victim Of Changes, Sinner, Starbreaker... ? Ok, I understand if you're a fan of 80's mainstream hard rock, but otherwise I don't.    This album was nothing more than an attempt at becoming more famous. Thank god that Priest redeemed themselves with Screaming For Vengeance. Even Turbo is better than this album.     Do I recommend it? Well, I guess that most of the people who look at this site have already heard it, but if you haven't, I don't recommend it, but I can't really tell you to avoid it because a lot of people like it, so maybe you'll like it.
B0013ND30W|5.0|if you own the 2003 special (2 disc) edition and are wondering if this is worth buying... again. i would say yes, and i believe you'll be purchasing for the last time. you can read all the features from other reviewers, but here's what they won't tell you. i played the blu-ray and s.e. simultaneously. the remastered picture is much brighter, defined, cleaner looking. i saw detail that i did not on the s.e., but more importantly i saw the whole movie. by this i mean that the s. e. is cropped. they released it in \\"widescreen\\", yes, but not in its original thatrical ratio of the 1950's. i have a 35 inch tv, the s.e. is missing an inch and a half of picture on ether side of my screen compared to the blu-ray! regardless of the percentage difference in your tv compared to mine, that's still movie you've never seen. i'd say that the original theatrical release preceding 1/2 hour short (grand canyon), the cleaned up \\"uncut\\" version of the classic movie itself, and a virtual walk through of the original 1950's disneyland sleeping beauty castle, make this a final purchase that's well worth the price. i hope disney gives this kind of treatment to all their blu-ray releases, it eases the pain of buying again.

Unfortunately, I was unable to finish the book due to the intensity of the foul language.  I tried several times to just get through hoping that would be the last of it, but it just continues so much that I finally had to put the book away.  It saddens me that this kind of language has to be present in books.  I wish there were warning labels like there are on music that contains explicit language.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|1. SPIRALLING - it's not as silly as it sounds when you hear it for the first time<br />2. THE LOVERS ARE LOSING - My favorite track of the album no matter what everyone says<br />3. BETTER THAN THIS - what's up with the guitar? I thought for a minute Keane is losing me<br />4. YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME ANYTHING - brilliant songwriting<br />5. PERFECT SYMMETRY - sweet Keane<br />6. YOU DON'T SEE ME - Mercury, did you visit Tom and the gang?<br />7. AGAIN AND AGAIN  - pretty nervous but Keane all the way<br />8. PLAYING ALONG - beattlesque waltz-like ballad<br />9. PRETEND THAT YOU'RE ALONE - children song? Guitar? Brass?<br />10. BLACK BURNING HEART - instantly recognized as Keane song, piano and bass line weaving wicked pattern with voice soaring above with a beautiful melody - pure bliss; unexpected French insert<br />11. LOVE IS THE END - I agree with many, this track crowns the album nicely and leaves you wanting more Keane.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I remember watching this movie every Halloween in elementary school> Now many years later i bought this on blu ray and its so incredible. The picture is just amazing.     *Now you can really see the textures and all the little details the artist put into this movie that were never seen before.     *The sound is great, pure amazing.     *this movie loaded fast on my blu ray player, so it seems very optimized to me.    This is over all a nice picture quality, the sound. Its like i was watching it for the first time because of all those little details that you can now see in HD.
0767903862|5.0|A visit to with an old friend with map in hand and adventure ahead is what I was to discover upon re-reading Sunburned Country. I first read Bryson's book about his trip to Australia when it was first published and recently recommended it to friends who are traveling with us down under later in the month. They loved the book and I thought it might be fun to re-read it in preparation for our trip. Now, I normally don't waist time going back to a book I have already read when I have too many on the shelf as it is. But this was a most rewarding and entertaining experience. Bryson is a traveler who specializes in being an historian of the lesser knows. If facts about plants and animals that can kill you in Australia could, in fact, kill you while reading about them; well, no doubt, I'm then now dead from a crocodile attack to my funny bone. What fun!
B001HDYK6Y|5.0|I was a little uncertain about how this album would turn out after listening to their single \\"spiralling\\", but I have to say that Keane has done it again. The guys went searching for themselves and found a new sound in the process. Who would have thought that a retro-80s-electronic-alternative style could sound so beautiful. Uplifting at times and dark elsewhere, this album is classic Keane with a fresh new style.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|As a kid, I listened to Metallica constantly. Then this thing happened in high school where I kind of forgot about metal altogether, getting real into blues and punk and that kind of stuff. I got this album as an afterthought, but it slapped me across the face as soon as I put it in. The first thing I thought while listening to it was, \\"Wow what have I been missing out on?\\" It feels like it rips by in about 20 minutes...until you look at the clock and realize its been over an hour.   Hetfield plays tighter than ever and Hammett finally puts out what feels like his first real solo of the decade. I think the lyrics are pretty good, and the delivery on them throughout the entire thing is amazing. I love the fact that there's a ton of different riffs in every song, and yet it still flows perfectly. The first half seems stronger than the second, but every track is solid. All Nightmare Long is one of the best songs Metallica's ever written.  This album completely blew me away. It may not ever reach the level as say, \\"Ride the Lightning\\", but it gets pretty close, and it's gotten me back into metal again.

B00028HBKM|4.0|This is a good film all in all, and I've not seen it before till this year.  I had heard bad things about it, that it was intenitonally anti-Semitic or that it was nothing more than a bloody Jesus snuff film, but I dediceded to watch this film just to be fair.      It is definitely views the Crucifiction from a more Catholic viewpoint, complete with extra-biblical imagery (crows eating the eye of a thief after he mocks Jesus, Mary Magdalene being equated with the sinful woman that Jesus rescues from stoning, which may or may not be nothing more than medieval stories).      Unlike alot of other movies depicting the Crucifiction, the imagery used here is horrific and shocking, but never gratuitous as in a slasher film.  The banality of evil is not glossed over, just as in Gibson's other film Apocalypto.  The evil is not redeemed not by cheap moralism, but by Jesus character as a figure that actually believed in what he said, in his life and in his death.  Gibson's cleverly interposes pictures of Jesus teachings in with scenes of the crucifiction.  A cut to less bloody times with birds chirping on a sunny, grassy hill, and Jesus preaching the Sermon on the Mount, with his teaching to love your enemies, is juxtaposed with Jesus bloody and dying, and praying to God to forgive his executioners because of their ignorance: the teaching has been fulfilled.      Also, I can somewhat understand the appeal of Maran devotion.  Throughout the film, Mary's story is weaved with the story of Jesus to reveal the early Christian community participating in the life of Jesus and his suffering, not something in an isolated manner that they sit back and watch.  After Peter's denial, he has a mental breakdown, the women-disciples try to comfort him. It is a deeply human appreciation that I don't think alot of Protestants would initially understand, the \\"Communion of Saints\\" is more than a sunday-morning soundbite in a creed.      My only critique is that it portrays Pontius Pilate as being a rather sympathetic character- at most he is a moral coward faced with two difficult choices.  Honestly the biblical accounts dont' give alot of evidence either way, although historically Pontius Pilate wasn't know for being very humane.  On the other hand, it doesn't gloss over the cruelty of the Romans.  The Romans are portrayed as mostly savage thugs, with a few sympathetic characters.  Likewise, not every Jew in the Sanhedrin is portrayed as being hopelessly wicked, although they are generally portrayed as pompous religious fanatics.   King Herod is portrayed as being a demented man-child, which seems to be accurate to the biblical account as well.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I love Ray LaMontagne and I've been a fan of everything he's done, but Gossip in the Grain is so unique and personal...I was amazed! People who call the songs filler or mush are not able to appreciate the art of the composition and the poetry that are these lyrics.  I agree that this is not Trouble, but why would you want it to be? That's been done already! He has grown and evolved into something even more beautiful on this album.  Winter Birds could be published poetry as far as I'm concerned.  And every song has a hint of a different style and a different time in the history of American music.  Please buy this album and keep an open mind.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This show is very unique and addicting.  My wife and I look forward to the next episode to see what else could possibly happen and who it will happen to.  It has a bit of dry almost hidden humor in just the right spots.  Great show!
B0017MO10U|5.0|Good movie. Better than the Ark of Truth. Some critics say it hurried at the end - I'm not sure of that. I mean I hate Star Trek Next Generation because of the hurried, jump-ahead endings that left a lot of info out. I did not have that feeling at all with this movie.   It would have been great if they threw in an appearance of the Russian commander that were in earlier StarGate episodes. Also, I wish Jack had a little more animosity towards Ball - after all, he did torture him more than any human ever (previous episodes). And in fact, after the torture episode is when Jack became more sarcastic. The writers probably did not even realize the timing of this slight character change. Jack is, through his sarcasm, still no doubt hiding the psycological pain of the torture Ball inflicted on him.  Ok enough of that... It is still a very good moive.
B001FBSMW6|3.0|They say you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover nor an album by its art. However, in the case of Keane's third album, Perfect Symmetry, there are some real similarities between the cover art and the music. Keane has pulled together an interesting collection of musical styles and influences, creating an overall effect something like the fractal images on the album cover itself. Fans of the first two albums (myself included) might find themselves unsure what to make of their use of vibrato key-board instead of their traditional (and crystal clear) piano, of their 80s influenced retro sound, or their departure from ballad choruses with some of the best pop hooks in the business.<br /><br />The album starts off with the best track first. Spiraling is witty, fun, and has a dance/funk feel. Full of energy, lyrical, and incredibly listenable, the first track sets you up for a huge disappointment in the next few tracks to follow.<br /><br />\\"The Lovers are Losing,\\" \\"Better than This,\\" and \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything,\\" have an 80s feel that simply isn't what I've come to expect from Keane. \\"You can do so much better than this,\\" the chorus to track #2 feels appropriate. Synthetic drums don't quite jive with the guitars in track #4, and take away from the lyrics, the only redeeming element of the song.<br /><br />Track #5, \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" offers a welcome return to what makes Keane excellent: solid piano, compelling lyrics, and of course the wonderful voice of Tom Chaplin. The song carries the same melancholic tones that fuel both of Keane's first two albums, and that create the 'mood' that I have come to associate with Keane. I love to play their stuff after a long day at work, and this song will take it's place on my 'cool down,' play list.<br /><br />\\"You Don't See Me,\\" is another solid effort, combining a vibro-synth keyboard with Tom's voice which creates a nice dynamic reminiscent of U2's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Again & Again,\\" carries some of the energy of \\"Spiraling,\\" and is another hybrid of Keane's old style and their new fascination with synth influences and 80s era sound. The chorus is fantastic. \\"It was in your eyes, in your eyes, they were just easy lies...\\"<br /><br />\\"Playing Along,\\" is an average track, with an Oasis feel to it. It's the most rock influenced track with strong electric guitars taking center stage rather than the keyboard that dominates the rest of the album. Not incredible, but listenable, this song just doesn't do it for me. If you're an Oasis fan, this will probably be your favorite track.<br /><br />\\"Pretend That You're Alone,\\" is terrible, and my least favorite track on the CD. The funk influence is there once more, but this time it is smashed together with Keane's piano-rock heritage. The result is painful to listen to.<br /><br />\\"Black Burning Heart,\\" is an ok track. It seems a little too slow until the chorus hits. However by that time the song has lost it's momentum.<br /><br />\\"Love Is the End,\\" is a quiet little love song, both breezy and sad. It's probably my third favorite track because it doesn't try to do too much, and is content to just tell a good story without the music overwhelming it.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad album, it just isn't the excellent album that I hoped it would be. There are elements of it that are great, and others that are quite poor. It comes across as an album not sure what its identity is. All the pieces are there, but like the cover, they've not been arranged correctly and sometimes even clash.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Keane, buy the CD, there are a half dozen decent tracks. If you're new to Keane, get [[ASIN:B000FBHT1C Under the Iron Sea]] instead. Follow that up with [[ASIN:B0006BGXEK Hopes and Fears]] and only make your way to \\"Perfect Symmetry,\\" once you've exhausted those two superior albums.and is another hybrid of Keane's old style and their new fascination with synth influences and 80s era sound.

B000YAA68C|5.0|It is incredible to know that Gerry will be dead in the beginning of this very romantic film! Gerard Butler (Gerry) and Hilary Swank (Holly) have great chemistry indeed. Gerry loves Holly so much that before dying of a brain cancer leaves her several letters, each one with a different and uplifting message and advice so that she can continue with her life without him, all of these letters ending with a \\"P.S. I love you\\"! Their most important and touching moments together are showed in flashbacks, really romantic, funny and also showing breathtaking scenery from Ireland, Gerry's homeland. Here we can feel and see how love is so strong that can overcome death. If you believe in love and is in the mood for a well told story, watch this movie. I ordered the book and am looking forward to reading it to compare it to the film. People say the film is much better... I'll return with my book review later... Cheers, friends! Live your lives full of love. That' what really matters!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, who already has the complete set of TV series, and is unable to go to the theater. It was a huge hit and has been watched, and enjoyed, many times over.
B000MQC9H4|3.0|I have watched this movie over and over and I never get tired of it.  It's one of those \\"feel good\\" movies that you almost hate to see come to an end.  The actors seem to fit their role to perfection.  It isn't a movie that is going to make you roar with laughter but the light humor absolutely puts a smile on your face.  Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet, Jack Black, and Eli Wallach all do a wonderful job of entertaining you.
0385335997|5.0|How about a little bubble wrap? I recently ordered several paperback books from Amazon and they were placed in one box without any paper or bubble wrap. As a result, two of the covers were bent. I paid for new books but a poor packing job made them look like used copies.
0375826726|5.0|Simply an amazing read.  You cannot put it down!!! Can't wait for the fourth book.
B000M4RGA6|4.0|I was hesitant to watch Will Farrell in this film, but was pleasantly surprised. My favorite line of the movie was when Emma Thompson, the writer says something like, if you set out to kill the guy in the story, and the guy wants to change the outcome, wants he finds out he will die, shouldn't those be the guys you keep alive? It speaks to those people who believe in fate, vs a predefined outcome to their lives, and the film overall is a great metaphor for not letting \\"life pass you by\\", in lieu of routine and monotony.<br /><br />All of the characters are well developed and the chemistry is fantastic. I love Maggie and Dustin in these roles, and Emma Thompson as usual, is  standout, as she is faced with her writer's block, and struggles with writing a tragedy vs a comedy. The film also reminds us what things are important in life, and how our behavior would/would not change if faced with sudden death. Although most people would anticipate a comedy, when Will Farrel is involved, this film, laces realism with a provocative challenge of examining our lives in a more \\"aware\\" state of mind. Not what I expected-recommend for a night of reflection, laughter and consideration.
B001BMKOZW|3.0|About 1/3 of the tracks are good and really rock out.  Good stuff!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the remaining 2/3rds of the tracks are throwaway songs.
B000002I99|5.0|Alice Cooper-Welcome To My Nightmare *****<br /><br />The best part of Welcome To My Nightmare is that everyone refers to it as Alice's concept album as if Alice Cooper never made another concept album. One thing is for sure it is among his strongest concepts. It reveals around the main character Steven (who is really just Alice and would reappear many many times in Coopers career) and how is is trapped in a nightmare...but it might not be a nightmare and that is what makes the album constantly exciting.<br /><br />What else is great is that this was Alice's first real solo album. This is where he met up with Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter, two of the most criminally underrated and forgotten guitar players in the history of the game.<br /><br />Featuring such classics as the totally unlike Alice Cooper title track 'Welcome To My Nightmare' which is easily among his top five tracks ever. Featuring a great percussion section and a minimal amount of guitar making it sound nothing like Alice. 'Devils Food' is also one of Coopers greatest works containing clever word play and some killer riffing from Wagner. 'Only Women Bleed' was covered by Guns N' Roses and is concidered one of Coopers best and became one of his biggest singles. Far from a personal favorite for me though lets just say that. 'Department Of Youth' while a fantastic song and among the best on the album throws the whole feel off because it is the only track that doesn't follow the theme of the album or the story line. 'Cold Ethyl' is classic horror rock and 'Steven' is fantastic both lyrically and theatre wise. 'Escape' closes the album making it end almost as perfect as it began.<br /><br />Alice would take a full scale Broadway cast with him to perform the album on tour including the great Richard Price for the narration. Welcome To My Nightmare is easily Coopers most adventurous album musically, lyrically, and production wise. It is also just one hell of a rock n' roll album
B00005JPO1|5.0|Exciting movie and a fine addition to the Indiana Jones saga.  There was a dude swinging from vines in it!  I even caught a glimpse of the ARK!  Right on God!  I saw that thing you had the Hebrews build for you!  Awesome! (It still looked good and seemed to be kept safe in storage, so you are being honored God!) I loved this movie, I loved the fact that there were Nephilim in it!  I loved watching a half crazy dude in it mumbling something or other all the time! I loved those crystal skulls!  I've studied those crystal skulls for years man!  And also ordinary bone skulls of odd shapes, just like the famous Star Child skull I first read about in UFO magazine! (No normal human DNA present!) Far out man!  There was an interdimensional rift in the fabric of time/space!  Much like the one I'm hoping opens up in my garage once they get the Super Collider working!  I loved the fact that God was mentioned and that there was a spaceship in it!  EXCELLENT!  It's the 50s man!  So this was like watching a 50s sci-fi Indiana Jones Adventure movie!  Bravo Spielberg, I GOT IT! (And I'm not even French!) As did most of the people who enjoyed this fine movie.  I thank God for great movies like this and I hope that many more are on the way.  THANKS GOD! (Spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the Heavens!)  I would be glad to sit next to Jesus and watch this movie with Him!  You're welcome to come into my house Jesus and sit and watch movies with me on my Vizio 47\\" LCD HD TV!  Leave the rift open when you get here, we'll both jump through on the way out and explore the Universe you made!  Far out man, Far out Jesus!  Great movie!  (I can get a refrigerator in my room too if you want some cold drinks handy without having to get up and leave the room thereby missing out on any action taking place).  Thanks Jesus, Thanks God/Dad!  Thanks Holy Spirit!  Awesome!
B00005ONMJ|1.0|I am disappointed with the CD. The problem is that it was not filmed in front of an audience. This means that there are no curtain calls or applause at the end of acts or after an aria is sung. This, in my opinion adds to the enjoyment of the opera.
0553381695|5.0|Mr. George R.R. Martin just repeated himself on this second offer in the series of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\".     Now there are a handful of Kings, all of them ready to kill the next. We also follow the Stark children, all separate from each other and always at risk.     Sansa still captive in King´s Land, Robb now is the King of the North and it´s facing the Lannisters in battle, Jon is beyond the Wall with the Black Knights and facing incredible horrors, Arya is traveling on the road, hiding her true identity as a boy and later working as a maid in a castle where she finds an strange new ally. Bran and his little brother just escaped Winterfell the great fortress of the Starks now taken and burned to the ground.    Indeed a great read, once you get familiar with the main characters you are ready for long hours of great adventures and clever plot after clever plot, lot´s of cliff hangers too.    I´m ready for the next two books \\"A Storm of Swords\\" and \\"A Feast of Crows\\".    Cheers!!!
B001AX9DT0|5.0|First off, no..this is not Trouble II.  This is the result of an amazing songwriter not trying to reproduce his past, but rather grow and let the music and the words take him to new places...and I certainly am glad I'm on for the ride.  This piece of work is brilliant.  The lyrics alone are outstanding and no one artist out there today can sing them with such passion.  Winter Birds is just a beautiful song that puts you right where he wants you to be.  As the case with Trouble and TTSTB, certain songs just grab you by the heart and speak to you in ways no other songs can.  Others who give this a bad review because it's not \\"Shelter\\" over and over, just don't understand what it means to grow as an artist.  This could be his best song writing job to date...keep it up Ray...already want more.  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!
0375826726|5.0|Wow, he has really stepped it up in this book. As much as I was disappointed that there will be a fourth book I am actually excited about it too. I started reading this series because of my neices and nephew but I have really enjoyed it for myself. Having grown up in Montana myself I understand much about the landscape the book was based on. For parents who might read this, this book is a little more graphic in the violence but I don't know that it is excessive. It is speaking about war after all. I really feel it is no problem for teenagers. There is no sex, drugs and foul language that saturates most of the other media found today. Really a great book and hope others find it so also. Thanks again to Amazon for the lowest price guarantee which got me the best deal on my book.
B000OVLNII|5.0|This book should be required reading for every US Citizen.  It combines together information on not just Lincoln, but his 4 main rivals, the process by which he came to be elected, the inner workings of his White House, the dynamics going on in every day life in the United States during that period and the overall fight to abolish slavery during that time -- all packaged in a wonderfully easy to read book.  I learned more by reading this one book than I did in all of my high school and college history classes combined. I suspect you will too.  Happy reading....
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Metallica reborn from his ashes!! amazing the work on the bass, simple and powerfull... the contents lyrics are cool, and the art of this edition is it from another world..
B000FCKIXW|3.0|As other reviews have mentioned, this book is full of repetitions that make it difficult to read at times. When the authors focus on specific events it gets interesting, but they then literally beat a dead horse by throwing in quotes that are basically saying the same thing over and over. The last chapter in genes and DNA was actually painful to read. The first two pages of the chapter were interesting, but the remainder of the chapter was like reading the same sentence over and over again. In addition, the founders of the company are made to look like angels and this fluff detracts from the books and makes it seem like a PR guide. Still, there were interesting parts, but there should have been at least 100 pages cut out.

0385340990|5.0|The title seems absurd. Start reading....<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. It is remininscent of British WW11 movies about \\"Chin Up\\", etc. However, the initial sense of grace under pressure diminishes within the first several pages. The feeling of a facile story passes and a deeper story immerges.<br /><br />In point of fact, it is very close to a modern version of a Jane Austen story; intimate, class conscious, followed by understanding, acceptance and love.<br /><br />This is a wise and lovely book that should be short-listed for the Pulitzer. It offers so much so sparingly. (Don't we all hate overwriting?)<br /><br />Finally, this book is not a \\"woman's\\" book. It's a lively description of the life and times of recent post-war England and the havoc that the Nazi's caused in this small piece of England. It is a microcosm for what they accomplished in the wider world during that awful war.<br /><br />This book is a book that can and will be read for many years to come. I hope schools have the sense to list this as a required reading book. It offers so much for discussion.<br /><br />I fully recommend this book for teens and older. It's a treasure.
B00004VWAF|5.0|What an amazing album! Miles combines elements of funk, punk, rock, avant-garde and of course jazz to create a unique sound (fusion) that only he could envision!  Miles was such a genius that his music transcends all ages.  I agree that he has certainly moved away from traditional jazz, and this album certainly ain't no \\"Kind Of Blue.\\"  However, I make the same argument for the Beatles, who had progressed from writing simple pop tunes like \\"She Loves You\\" to experimental sounds like in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" from Revolver and then Sgt. Pepper and the White Album. If you're also looking for \\"Bags' Groove\\" sound, this ain't it either--Miles had long turned that corner.  Instead he had begun to dabble with new sounds in \\"Bitches Brew\\" and then moved on full force with \\"On The Corner.\\"

B000W1V3ZI|4.0|When I first heard this album, it didn't really strike me as anything special.  It was different from the Incubus I knew and loved, and I wasn't sure I even liked it.  However, last night as a total fluke, I ended up listening to it.  Maybe I was too young to appreciate it then, or maybe my tastes have just changed, but suddenly at least most of the songs sounded great!  I hadn't noticed the dynamics of songs like \\"Oil and water\\" and \\"Rogues\\" before, focusing almost solely on \\"Dig\\" and \\"Anna Molly.\\"  The album still has its flaws, of course.  There are a few moments in \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off\\" where the vocals are off, and some songs don't necessarily reach their full potential, but overall, it is a job well done for Incubus.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|I didn't go for the plot too much on this show, so it's not a thriller I'd watch time and again. I'd watch it once, but probably not buy it like I did.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|There is really no reason to see this movie unless you just want more of the same.  Too many unrealistic death-escaping sequences, dozens of bad-guys shooting at them the whole time and of course nobody gets a nick.  Old men, old women easily outrunning the bad guys, who, buy the way, are supposed to be russian this time, but you really can't tell them apart from the older movies.  Jeeps, machine guns, waterfalls, and of course, bugs (giant ants in this episode).  John Hurt holding up the \\"alien\\" head, his moment of nastalga.  Harrison's voice has lost all passion and power - he sounds old, he looks old, he is old.  Check out how old speilberg and lucas look in the documentary, then we can all feel old together.

1433502410|5.0|The ESV is the best new translation by a very long way - and this study bible is going to be an invaluable tool in getting to understand God's word better. The effort put into this version has been colossal and has paid off: this book is splendid. Ten cheers for Crossway not just for the ESV (the best, most accurate and also readable version on the market today) but for this tool to help us all get more out of our Bible reading.

0375826726|4.0|I had read some of the previous amazon reviews and I prepared myself for the worst. Well I actually enjoyed this book a lot and read it in a couple of days. I agree with most that his writing has matured. With regards to Paolini's influences, he has always worn on them on his sleeve - he makes little effort to conceal them. The story was entertaining enough. Is it the great next piece of literature? No, but he doesn't pretend that it is either. A lot of people complain of the wordiness of some parts... Have you read Nanvy Novik's Temerarie series or even Tolkien?<br />If you have enjoyed the series pick it up. If your thinking about starting just remember he started writing when he was 14 and if you see the amazon videos Paolini is still that geeky kid (like me) who enjoys fantasy!

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This has to be the best broadway cast recording i have heard in a long time. Idina and Kristin's voices are amazing. Even though they are totally different they mesh together so well. The orchestration is amazing as well. I love that almost whenever Elphie does a song its percussion and brass driven [almost like a lurking shadow effect] and when Glinda does a song its mostly strings and woodwinds. This CD is just genius. And the show is amazing defintaly go see it!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Wherever you looked on a metal/rock forum in the past years, there was bound to be a constant onslaught of moaning and whining and bitching about Metallica and the new direction they've taken. This album flips the bird to all the countless smartasses who wrote gems like \\"Metallica died with Cliff\\" or \\"They're a bunch of fags now\\"; and it does so with such ferocity and rage and power that it'll blow you away for sure, unless you're a half-deaf Megadeth fanatic. It instantly dethroned RTL as my fave 'Tallica album. Best metal record of the decade, hands down! The Day That Never Comes gripped my heart and guts and just doesn't let go, All Nightmare Long is a direct sequel to Enter Sandman and rips its predecessor apart like a pitbull would \\"process\\" a chihuahua; while Suicide & Redemption is right up there with Orion as one of the greatest instrumental epics ever. The cap-off (My Apocalypse) is a 100% pure thrash anthem that's sure to send crowds into a frenzy all over the world. ACE!!!
B000S0GYRU|5.0|The Italian maestro of horror, Dario Argento's first installment of his \\"Three Mothers\\" trilogy begins with \\"SUSPIRIA\\" (1977); arguably the most beloved of his films in the 1970s. There has always been debate among his fan base whether this film or \\"Deep Red\\" is his masterpiece. Some say it should be \\"Tenebre\\". For me, I am still somewhat undecided. I like his psychological \\"giallos\\" as much a his occult films. Whatever you prefer, \\"Susperia\\" is a dark fairy tale that will forever be remembered in the journals of horror films.<br /><br />One dark, dank and stormy night, an American ballet dancer named Susie Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in a ballet school in Freiburg. This European ballet school is ran by a mysterious woman named Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) and Miss Tanner (Alida Valli). A number of mysterious deaths and horrific crimes begin to occur in the school shortly after her arrival. Apparently, they are linked to the school itself; while the area on which the school stands on has a relation to a certain \\"Black Queen\\", a practitioner of the dark arts of the occult and witchcraft.<br /><br />The film's plot is quite light when compared to \\"Deep Red\\" or even \\"Tenebre\\", but this fact doesn't make this film any less eerie or suspenseful. From the opening act the film exudes a dark and moody feel, Argento's magnificent eye for visuals are at its best. It took me at least two viewings to truly appreciate \\"Suspiria\\". The use of vibrant colors I've read became a revolutionary palette for the horror maestro, and to think that he used obsolete Technicolor film rolls to shoot his film.<br /><br />The first act of the film remains as one of the most memorable sequences in horror. The opening act's death scene is truly violent and very \\"artsy\\"; that it grabs the viewer by the throat just to let him know what he is in for. This is a familiar formula for Dario Argento, as displayed in \\"Tenebre\\" and \\"Deep Red\\". Most of his films display a shocking murder and/or death sequence as \\"shock value\\". The director really does know how to get under one's skin with an unnerving sensation. It is quite curious that Argento (with co-writer Daria Nicolodi) owes his inspiration for \\"Suspiria\\" from a Disney animation--\\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\". I've read that the film was originally intended to use a children's school as its backdrop but for reasons unknown to me, that idea was abandoned. (perhaps it would generate too much controversy?)<br /><br />\\"Suspiria\\" has a decent share of ominous atmosphere. Argento uses vibrant colors, intimidating and spooky architecture, the use of shadows, combined with Goblin's ominous music all contribute to the film's effectively creepy screenplay. The film also applies some lore from witchcraft and the occult as it takes a look at the mythology about witchcraft. Food does spoil a lot faster when it is within the confines of witches, at least according to legend. I do think the director has a certain curiosity about witches that led him to create one, if not the most involving tales about the subject. The scientific definition of the occult is also defined which adds to the film's credibility. Daria Nicolodi is to be credited for some of the film's creative inputs as she supposedly told Argento about her grandmother who had a similar experience in a school that practiced black magic. Whether this is fact or a rumor I would not know.<br /><br />The performances by the cast is quite decent but not entirely flawless. Jessica Harper does give a decent performance but I rather thought that she lacked some chemistry with Stefania Casini. Nonetheless, Argento is able to make this a very minor setback as he bombards the screen with his signature ingenious camerawork along with cinematographer Luciano Tovoli. I was in awe as to how the death of the blind piano player was set up. It was suspenseful and freaky, with great use of pans, reverse zooms, close-ups and moving shadows. Aside from the opening's death scene, this would be my favorite sequence in the film. Argento is a master of simple visual manipulation. I was a little disappointed that this installment had no nudity but I supposed it fit the film's pace. There are quite a few gruesome scenes carefully placed in the film's proceedings.  \\"Suspiria\\" has definite Giallo influences in its opening marks just before it goes into overdrive.<br /><br />Dario Argento may have more style in his supernatural films. His Giallos and his occult films are like apples and oranges, they`re both good but can`t be compared. Regardless, however you may feel about \\"Suspiria\\", whether this is your first Argento film or you're a big fan; the creative death sequences, the maggot attack (or shower), the dog mauling are stuff that are truly noteworthy in the film. For a film made in 1977, it is way ahead of its time. The use of colors, manipulation of the senses and very creepy atmosphere make this film one of Dario Argento's most celebrated works, and it still holds up to this present time.<br />Highly Recommended! [4 ½ Stars]<br /><br />The 2-disc 25th Anniversary Dvd by Blue Underground has a THX-Certified re-mastered picture and the sound mix has both 5.1 Dolby Digital and 5.1 DTS.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have read the whole Tilight series and have completely fallen in love with all the characters. This final instalment was the greatest by far. Among reading the reviews of other readers, others don't agree with me too much. Other readers believe that this book was a complete and epic fail. The fact that Bella is pregnant and that it seems unrealistic is what makes this book more of a fantasy, which it really is. Therefore I would like to say Bravo to Meyer and I wish her the best of luck in her young but prosperous career.
B001DTUTU8|5.0|The scene which I absolutely love is the moment when Jo Jo's secret sound system is discovered by his father; everything is alive musically, bells are ringing out, squeaky toys can be heard and every sound is joyously adding more resonance to the Who's rallying call to he heard, so the film culminates in one phenomenal musical centre piece which does lift you up. You feel when watching the film that everyone's enthusiasm at Blue Sky was poured into each frame and of course it must have helped with the voice talents of Steve Carell and Jim Carrey leading the way, as their characters were superbly animated enhancing every line and word which effortlessly tripped off their tongues. The look of the film is true to Seuss, you can see it from start to finish and on the Limited edition DVD set and Blue - Ray release you have extensive footage showing how they created the Seuss look for the characters and their environments.     Blue Sky studios has been making films which try to present before children narratives which convey the big picture; in Ice Age the idea of forgiveness and of surviving together is central to the story and characters development, in Robots the idea of staying true to yourself motivates the lead character and inspires those around him to do only good in the world and in Horton, which is a Seussian story, we are presented with a character who must over come adversity in order to save a world. Horton sees that we are all responsible for the our environments well being and for the well being of those around us and that a better world is one where we support each other since we are all interdependent on each other for survival. Horton is a fine metaphor for mans place in the cosmos as custodians of our fragile planet. This film is rich in metaphorical layers.    Blue Sky studios has the ability to echo the zeitgeist of our time, this gives them the edge over Pixar and - Disney especially, who are too preoccupied by what it means to be Disney and not focusing enough on what it means to tell a story. I am probably being unfair to the Disney studios but when they pipe their mantra about what it means to be Disney it has the reverse affect on some people who really are only looking for well told animated stories and Walt himself would have stated such a view, Disney after all only reflected the spirit of his time and now Blue Sky does the same. I look forward to future films by this first rate animation company.    This Limited Edition is very different to the standard edition in that it has many extra features which take you behind the scenes of the film, an in-depth presentation at how they made the look of the film feel very Seussian and interviews with the cast and crew. If you are a budding animator or a fan of the film you won't be disappointed. There is an extra disc which is the digital copy the other reviewer was mentioning.
B000F3UAFC|4.0|What makes this film wonderful is that it is made after Oscar Wilde's play \\"Mrs. Windermere's Fan\\".  For anyone who saw his play in the theatre, this film is visual disappointment in terms of costumes, jewelry, hair and mannerisms of the female characters.  Two main female leads Scarlet Johnasson and Helen Hunt are miscast.  It is almost as if their roles are reversed.  Johansson is too seductive to be cast as a prim young bride, while Hunt's thin lips and deep, severe facial lines make her even less appealing in her role of a seductress of men.  Wilde's smart snippets of wisdom make this film lively.  Although film was made in Italy, I wish there were more beautiful places showing in the film that could entice some true romantic emotions - but that is not the case.  Tom Wilkinson is great in portraying aging, wealthy man, somewhat pretending to be shallow and yet remaining irresistibly endearing.  The moral tale of how men can get away with being a playboy while women have to conform to a higher standards of a moral virtue is still true today.  I liked the line that Helen Hunt had where she says to a young woman:\\"Do you think that just because we got a right to vote that makes us equal to the standards of men?\\"  Good entertainment, but not a great movie.
0446402389|4.0|I had just about given up on the novel as I couldn't stand reading any more about Leo and his blind devotion to The State.  Since the demise of the Soviet Union I think we've forgotten just how horrendous the system was and how nightmarish it must've been during those years.  Smith describes the paranoia and suspicion of the Stalinist era so well, one can feel the fear of the peasants and ordinary citizens coming off the page. Admittedly, the attitude that the minute someone was suspected they were guilty made me so mad I almost took the book back to the library BUT I persevered to the end and was very glad that I did.  Altho the ending is a little contrived, I found the book overall brilliantly suspenseful and I hope to see more of Leo and Raisa in future novels.

B001DTPZNY|1.0|After so many years of being without Indiana Jones it would seem that they would have thought more on the topic of their latest release.  Sure<br />with the special effects of the series in years gone by it would be hard to assume it could be a reality.  However this movie was so far fetched it really didn't make sense.<br /><br />The movie also didn't have substance.  The story in the movie was just as if they put this whole storyboard together in 6 hours.  With the lack of a great storyline that was expected as in years gone by I would guess this will be the last in the series.  If they do come up with another movie then I do hope they will at least give it some thought.<br /><br />In short - Save Your Money or at least wait until it's in the $5.00 bins at your local retail store.  I would have given it a lower review but they don't give you an option for negative stars.
0792833279|5.0|Probably the greatest ensemble cast performance of 1995, `Get Shorty' is also one of the greatest comedies of that given year as well.  It's witty, smart and engaging from start to finish, with enough twists and turns to keep us glued yet not so many that we wind up confused.  There is really little to nothing worth griping about since the film is, well, perfect.<br /><br />I almost hate reviewing films this good because it becomes difficult to find things to talk about.<br /><br />So, `Get Shorty' revolves around Chili Palmer, loan shark turned Hollywood movie mogul as he is turned onto the business while collecting from sleazy Hollywood director Harry Zimm.  Chili has an interest in film (he loves movies) and he is growing tired of the life of a gangster, so he dives head first into this newfound life of crime (the film does a gallant job of proving the similarities between legal and illegal `crime').  Harry has his eye on a film that is going to make him a huge Hollywood player; the only problem is that the scripts writer died and his wife wants half-a-mill for the rights to the film.  Wannabe mogul Bo Carlett wants in, but Chili wants to be Harry's sole partner.  Chili makes nice with Karen, an actress who was once married to two-time Academy Award nominee Martin Weir, in hopes that she could get him interested in doing the film.  In the meantime Harry is scrounging around trying to get someone to put up the money for the script, and when he's exhausted his options he tries to entice Ray Bones, Chili's ex-employer.<br /><br />There is a lot going on here, but it is all constructed in such a brilliantly fluid way.  Nothing ever gets lost in the joggle, each character is wonderfully fleshed out and each actor does a masterful job at bringing the goods.<br /><br />John Travolta rightfully won the Golden Globe for best comedic performance; it's just a shame the Academy didn't see right to nominate him.  I may prefer his turn here to his Oscar nominated turn in `Pulp Fiction'; operative word being `may'.  He is hilariously on-point here, delivering such a cool and collected performance that permeates the entire film.  I love me some Hackman, and he is also quite good here, but he takes a backseat to the array of characters sharing the screen with him.  Dennis Farina is the films biggest standout.  His animosity with Chili is engaging and rewarding from scene one onward.  He brings the funny brilliantly.  Delroy Lindo needs better roles.  He is a very engaging actor, but he never really pushes himself in the right directions.  This is the best I've seen him.  Rene Russo normally turns me off, but she was so charismatically natural here, funny and witty and charming; I just loved her.  Danny DeVito, James Gandolfini, David Paymer; everyone in the film does a fantastic job of doing what they do best.<br /><br />If you are looking for an engaging and rewarding movie experience then look no further than `Get Shorty'.  This is one of those comedies that has it all.  From the script to the acting to the memorable sets, `Get Shorty' is a must see, a film that is a `must get'; as in \\"you must get `Get Shorty'\\".g `may'.

I mean a magic using telepathic dragon rider who's the only one who can stop him.  There's some variation but you toss in Dwarves, Elves, and morality issues ad you get at best a lackluster plot.

B00008RH3L|5.0|Often hailed as the Coen brothers finest film; `Millers Crossing' is a brilliant gangster film that exceeds the film the Academy decided to embrace this given year (yes, I'm talking to you `GoodFellas').  `Millers Crossing' is quiet when it needs to be, shocking when necessary, and always effortlessly chilling.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Irish gangster Tom Reagan, lieutenant to crime boss Liam O'Bannon.  O'Bannon's power is challenged by rival crime boss Johnny Caspar, and soon things start to shift within the O'Bannon clan.  When it is revealed that Reagan is having an affair with O'Bannon's lover Verna his is cast out of the family and soon finds himself negotiating with Caspar.  Tom has some outstanding gambling debts that threaten his life, and Verna's brother Bernie has been making trouble for Caspar, so they make a deal.<br /><br />If Tom helps Caspar with his problem, Caspar will help Tom with his.<br /><br />The film is a solid gangster film that embellishes all the great things about this particular genre.  It is violent, extremely at times, but it is also very sullen.  The film possesses this unsettling calm, this effortless ease that permeates each scene and gives off this purified feeling of dread.  This is especially noticeable in the forest scenes that just reek of fantastic, caressing the audience with its faux sense of serenity.<br /><br />We can all get down on our knees and praise cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld for this.<br /><br />The same calm accomplished by the direction is also evident in the marvelous acting on all fronts.  The film is carried on the shoulders of Gabriel Byrne, who marvelously captures the repressed hostility within Tom's actions.  As great as Byrne is, the supporting cast is so much better.  Miss Harden is flawless, delivering a distilled sensuality that just envelopes her character and everyone around her.  Jon Polito is effectively repulsive as Caspar, and J.E. Freeman is chillingly horrific as Eddie Dane, Reagan's biggest opponent.  Albert Finney is marvelous as Liam O'Bannon, capturing the paternal instincts as well as the killer ones.  He reminds me somewhat of Tony Soprano, likable yet deadly, but in a vastly different way.<br /><br />The films biggest stand out would have to be John Turturro though, such a brilliantly layered performance.  He goes from sadistic to emotionally crippled with effortless ease, and his whole breakdown in the woods, where he begs for his life, is the film single greatest moment.  What makes that moment so fantastic is the mirrored moment that comes towards the end, where Bernie tries his hand at the same plea...<br /><br />\\"Look into your heart.\\"<br /><br />...but you can tell, as he can, that this time it won't work.  You can see on his face that he knows that you know that everyone else knows that we can see right through this façade.<br /><br />\\"What heart?\\"<br /><br />`Millers Crossing' is a marvelously crafted epic that will leave your blood chilled and your heart cold, and that is beautiful when considering the genre.  There are countless efforts made in this regard, to create a gangster film that get everything right, but rarely does it happen with such effortless grace.  The Coen's have a huge following, and they have won awards for films such as `Fargo' and the recent `No Country for Old Men'; but to me, `Millers Crossing' is probably their finest hour.

B00005NTN5|3.0|I really expected very little from this film.  I knew that it had a big cult following, but so does `Showgirls', and lord knows how dreadfully ridiculous that trash was.  So, it's safe to say that at best I was expecting another `Poison Ivy', you know, equipped with a decent performance or two but ultimately void of any real merit.  While in parts I believe my initial preconceived notion of the film is correct, there is much to enjoy here that I wasn't expecting.<br /><br />Sure, I expected to enjoy the whole `girl on girl' gangster side of things, but when you remove the `girl on girl' part there is actually still a pretty decent movie here.<br /><br />The film tells us of Violet, an attractive woman dating a violent gangster.  Violet has repressed feelings for other women that become manifest when she meets Corky, an ex-con who is hired to maintain the building Violet and Caesar are residing in.  Corky is instantly attracted to Violet, and the feelings are mutual.  They soon concoct a plan to steal two million dollars from the mob and set up Caesar to take the fall, this way they can be free to love one another without restraint.  Their plan isn't as foolproof as they originally conclude, and so things start to savagely unravel as Caesar's business partners get involved and soon Corky and Violet are exposed, and they have to fight for their lives.<br /><br />The first part of the film tends to drag a bit.  It comes off rather ridiculous in scenes, overdoing the steamy sections in order to compensate for lack of `action'.  It really comes off like a soft-core adult film at first, thus confirming my initial thoughts.  But, as the film progresses and our attention is shifted towards the money and the scheme it all starts to elevate to a decently crafted and well filmed caper.  It really works.  The final scenes are stunning in moments and truly chilling.  The acting also gets a major boost as the film progresses.  What came off at first like amateur fluff transforms to smartly calculated character development, especially from Jennifer Tilly who transforms Violet from a ditzy girlfriend to a deceptive and intelligent `girlfriend'.  Joe Pantoliano (from `Sopranos' fame) also delivers a strong performance.  He works with his characters clich&eacute;s well and filters through feelings of betrayal and fear quite nicely.  Gina Gershon (who was actually the only respectable part of `Showgirls') is nice eye-candy here, but she takes a backseat to Tilly's breathy performance.<br /><br />The film is not perfect, and it really could have used a little tightening and reworking (especially in the beginning), but it works itself out and deserves recognition for that.  I am baffled a bit by all the reviews of adoration for this film, because one should not be blind to the films problems, but I do feel that the film is no where near as bad as it could have been.  A film that could have easily been an F, or at best a low D rises above itself in the final chapter and becomes a solid C, C+ even.  Sure, that may sound like a low rating, but when you factor in the films genre you can see that a C is actually pretty good.character development, especially from Jennifer Tilly who transforms Violet from a ditzy girlfriend to a deceptive and intelligent `girlfriend'.

B0016B6ZKG|2.0|During her extraordinary run from the mid-'70s to early '80s, Donna Summer reigned supreme as the \\"Queen of Disco\\" and \\"The First Lady of Love.\\" Ultimately, she was the only disco performer to make a meaningful transition to pop and pop/rock (\\"She Works Hard for the Money,\\" \\"Unconditional Love,\\" \\"The Wanderer,\\" et al). With this, her first all-new album in 17 years, Miss Summer attempts to recapture past glories. Unfortunately, she fails.

If you want a painless (and funny) intro into understanding science news, this is the place to get it.     Dr. Goldacre may be writing in Britain, but everything he says is relevant to the way science and medicine is reported in this country.  What are drug companies hiding? What is behind the good for you/bad for you news on health?  What about alternative medicine and vitamins? How can I judge evidence for myself?   You can learn quite a bit from this slender volume.      Find a way to get it!
B001DDBCUK|4.0|The movie arrived very quickly and faster than expected. The price was a bargain for a newly released movie and I was able to get free shipping by receiving it just a few days later. Very pleased with my purchase and will definately be buying from amazon again.

B001AHM2C6|5.0|When i heard for the first time Batman Begins soundtrack, i said \\" it's shame, the Danny Elfman theme, from the first Batman 1989, was completely erased\\". But after listening again entire soundtrack, i said \\"Wouahh! It's really huge!!!\\"  And this soundtrack push even further all Batman theme. It's amazing how much orchestral instruments, percussions elements and electronic sounds mix perfectly together.  Very impressive on a good Hi-Fi system.

B000W91RUG|4.0|The Big Bang Theory is, by turns, great and awful.<br /><br />Great: The geek humor of the show is funny and includes some semi-obscure geek references, but it is by no means a show that will go over viewers heads. The actors are charming -- particularly Johnny Galecki as Leonard,  which most of us remember as David on Roseanne (I loved him even then!), and Jim Parsons as Sheldon, the socially-inept, uber-geek.<br /><br />Awful: Penny (played by Kaley Cuoco) is a dumb bimbo. She seemingly lacks any capacity to understand most of what the guys are saying, and worse yet, she doesn't care. Most of the time, she parades around in absurdly skimpy clothing, choosing to use her body rather than her mind. I think Penny is there, ideally, to balance out the awkwardness of the guys, but instead of providing a balance, she just seems like a dumb blonde.<br /><br />My reservations aside, I enjoyed this show enough to buy it. The female roles in this show are atrocious, but the male ones are funny and lovable.

0743290119|2.0|Weisberger's novels have been getting exponentially dumber. The next one will be completely unreadable. The beauty of [[ASIN:0307275558 The Devil Wears Prada]] (and to a lesser extent, [[ASIN:1416543007 Everyone Worth Knowing]]) is that they were shallow, fun reads that didn't require much brainpower to motor through. Chasing Harry Winston is a shallow read devoid of fun that is so boring I had to struggle to maintain interest.
0446343129|5.0|I loved this book, I bought it after I got the book Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon. Reading the low down on what sugar, and also the fast food industries and food conglomerates have done to the health of humanity is a real eye opener!<br /><br />If you have bad health, try to get rid of refined sugar and flour, stop drinking pop, eating tv dinners and drink raw milk if you can get it (try searching realmilk.org for sources in the US). I noticed a very good improvement in my health, as I get rid of eating sugar I have noticed my teeth are stronger, and the Rheumatoid Arthritis I had been developing in my wrist has gone away completely! This is a great book, it tells the real deal of what these huge industries are doing to the health of people just for profit.<br /><br />Throw away your sugar bowl and your breakfast cereal! Kick your habit. This book exposes why you should. And, as far as the one reviewer who said he assaulted 'Catholics'...I have no idea where they got that one from.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Normally, when a movie is touted as being \\"family-friendly\\" it's a codeword for \\"incredibly boring.\\" Penelope, conversely, is both family-friendly and entertaining. It's even extremely charming to boot. Normally, a movie feels strained or too simple when it strives to be viewable by everyone -- trying to please too many people results in pleasing no one -- but this story is complete and perfect.
B0011HOEY4|2.0|In \\"American Gangster,\\" Denzel Washington stars as Frank Lucas, a 1960's Black mafioso, a \\"made\\" man who seizes and maintains an iron-fisted control of various Harlem rackets, including the most profitable of all--drug trafficking.  Lucas' old-world emphasis on loyalty and ruthlessness rivals that of any of his Italian counterparts. However intriguing, it's a story line that is nevertheless tired and all too familiar. The movie never really takes flight.  Indeed, the film not only suffers from an overly-familiar plot, but also cinematography that is sometimes drab and colorless.  \\"American Gangster\\" is further undermined by the disingenuous premise that Black people were somehow better off being exploited and victimized by Black drug lords and Black racketeers than by Whites. As such, this is one of the most distasteful parables of American capatalism.     While \\"American Gangster\\" is suffused with the requisite \\"family ties,\\" grisly killings, duplicitous associates, cops on the make and other betrayals, it may be that we've seen too many better-made mafia movies.  After all, how could any such movie match the incomparable \\"Godfather\\" films?  Director Ridley Scott, Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are among the most gifted and imaginative practitioners around, but in the end, even they can't shore up an exceedingly long and slow-paced movie like \\"American Gangster,\\" which finally buckles under the weight of its own grandiosity.
0307277887|2.0|I can't remember the last time a book inspired such mixed emotions in me. I was simultaneously charmed by Dexter and bored by the plot. (The television show turned out much the same way.)<br /><br />Dexter is witty, charming, and manages to connect with the reader despite the fact that he's dead inside. Jeff Lindsay's character development with Dexter is brilliant and results in an engaging, endearing serial killer.<br /><br />The plot, conversely, is dull, tired, and uninspired. Not the worst thing I've ever read, but nothing to write home about. I was glad that the length of the book was relatively short -- and it still managed to seem endless at times.<br /><br />Ultimately, I would recommend the book with the caveat that the plot is something you have to get through in order to enjoy the company of Dexter for a few hours.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|So, how does a movie with hero's, villians, youth, love, family, superheroes, gansters, guns, dazzling effects, well thoughtout details, action, heart, and even a monkey bomb so poorly at the box office? Easy- the people who remember the cartoon didn't take kindly to the numbing effects, and the story was too layered to appeal to kids.    I fought watching this movie tooth and nail. I even tried to watch it once but turned it off after about 15-minutes. Then a long time friend emplored me to watch it in its entirety, and man am I glad I did. I am sorry this franchise never took off and is on record for being one of the worst box office failures of 2008, because I would have loved to have seen where the Wachowski Brothers took it next.    Give this movie a shot. Give yourself reason to let your imagination take you, and give in to the fantastic film event that is Speed Racer.
B000FDFVZ6|2.0|Everyone raved about this book. I was told by multiple people that I just HAD to read it. I finally read it and am completely underwhelmed.<br /><br />More than anything, this book feels like it was written for the Lifetime Network crowd: people (primarily women) who have a morbid fascination with bad things happening to other people. The story had a chance to put a unique spin on an oft-told tale, but instead it was completely uninspired and felt like it should be sandwiched between a story about a woman who was attacked and wheelchair bound but still won a gold medal and a story about a woman who gets up the courage to finally leave her cheatin', beatin', drinkin' husband.<br /><br />Nothing about this story moved me one way or the other. I didn't feel hatred or love. I didn't cry or laugh. It was a complete waste of my time.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|For those of you who were immensely disappointed with Terminator Three the movie this series makes up for it.     Set shortly after the second movie, Terminator - The Sarah Connor Chronicles picks up the action in between the second and third movies. When Cameron (a Terminator reprogrammed by by the future resistance) come back to the past she saves Sarah and John from a new threat and takes them to the present day (about ten years into the future) forever changing things making it as though the third movie never happened. (thank god!)     The Sarah Connor Chronicles has a closer feel to the second movie and is filled with fast passed action. The acting is great and the plot is new and interesting. I highly recommend this to any fans of the first two movies.
B000OPPBEQ|1.0|Is anyone else having this issue? I'm trying to play it on my HTPC and so far this is the first blu-ray movie I have come across that I can not play.  At first I thought it my be something with the blu-ray live, like with Iron Man, but when I disable my internet, still doesn't work.  When I try playing the movie I can see the warning sign saying do not copy, then the WB logo intro and then the loading screen, but after that it goes black and doesn't respond.  I upgrade my blu-ray players firmware, but that hasn't help either.  Does anyone have any advice?  The blu-ray drive that I'm using is LITEON DH-401S
B000P12LWY|3.0|Showtime should be commended for creating another beautifully filmed mini-series. They should be strangled, however, for their complete lack of historical accuracy. If you want sensuality in your late night prime time then The Tudors is your ticket. The characters are beautiful and the performances are honest, gritty and gripping; which makes this series a pleasure to watch. But, if you're going to make a series based on the tomfoolery of royalty and its trappings, you may want to implore a little chronological precision.
B00005JPO1|1.0|Save your money.      This latest installment is clumsy and poorly executed -- and no amount of second disc extras and outtakes is going to fix that.    Set aside the 'aliens isn't archaeology' factor -- it's just a badly made movie. It's full of plot holes and leaps in logic that distract, as well as fight scenes and shoot outs that are right out of Mystery Science Theater.       Honestly, I kept looking for Jar Jar Binks.     Lucas needs to realize that those old serials he loves so much aren't that well made. And that he already did his long drawn out homage to his childhood with the Outsiders ...     Go buy yourself a copy of Last Crusade or Raiders instead.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|I love this cd. Ms. Badu took her music to another dimension. With the economy the way it is, everybody needs to listen to \\"The Hump\\". It was real and insightful, like the rest of this cd. Does anybody know when part 2 is coming out?
B00005JPO1|2.0|Heck, even Spielberg and Lucas advised moviegoers to \\"lower their expectations\\" before the film came out.  I remember that news article very clearly.  From one standpoint, that could mean that they acknowledge that NO  Indy film could ever live up the the nearly 20 years of pent-up expectation.  But I truly believe they asked us to lower our expectations because they knew they had a cinematic turd on their hands.<br /><br />It was widely reported for years that Spielberg and Ford were opposed to Lucas' vision of a fourth Indy film featuring extraterrestrials.  Other ideas and treatments came and went over the years too, but finally George wore everybody down and masterminded this abomination of a sequel.  I guess Spielberg and Ford realized that the clock was ticking and it was either do it George's way or don't do it at all.<br /><br />Lazy script, stiff and wooden performances, lack of real suspense, ridiculously absurd action set-pieces, lapses in logic..... everything adds up to a high-budget film that was made simply for the point of making it.<br /><br />Add a few Playboy Playmates to it and it could be an Andy Sidaris film.<br /><br />I'm sure the DVD release has some bells and whistles included, but for the sake of all that is cinematically holy, do NOT buy this film.  Rent it if you simply MUST see it once in a while, but don't buy it.  If this DVD release makes a lot of money, it'll just encourage Lucas to make more bad movies.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|I'm glad I didn't listen to the lower reviews and purchased the album anyway.  It doesn't top Trouble.  That's going to be a tough one to beat.  But, it's better than Till The Sun Turns Black.  It's an album you need to really listen to and feel the lyrics with the music.  Songs like Winter Birds have such awesome depictions of a scene you can't help but lose yourself in.  Don't look for the top-40 pop hits.  Simply enjoy the music!  If you have enjoyed his past two albums, I don't see how you can't enjoy this one.  It's not all that different.  I almost see it as a blend between the two.<br /><br />I can tell this will be one I listen to back-to-back many times over.  Well done.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|Some bands put out several albums before they perfect their sound. These guys did it with their debut album (Hopes and Fears). Contrary to what some reviews have claimed, I do not see this album as a major departure for this band. There is some experimentation with synthesizers and other new wave sounds (the cheesy clap percussion for instance), but overall the song structures are quite similar. And these guys continue to rip out catchy crescendo choruses like it is no big deal.     This album is by no means flawless, but as a work of pop-rock it is as good as anything I've heard in the past decade. Their best songs easily rival or outshine the best from bands like Coldplay and U2. The production is excellent, and Tom Chaplin's voice is strong as always, (with a hint of Freddie Mercury which I personally love) and never muted by the instruments.     If I had one complaint, it would be that on some songs, the backing music is somewhat sparse until the chorus kicks in. I attribute this to the lack of a true guitarist in this band. But then again, Tom's voice is powerful enough that you generally don't notice it, or mind it for that matter.    So there you have it. Three consecutive excellent albums by a band that puts out great rock music that is sure to please the masses. This is one case where I don't mind being one of them.
1433502410|5.0|I have many leather bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany. Not really, but I do have many study Bibles . . . and the ESV Study Bible is definitely the best one I've come across.    I was very surprised to like this Bible so much. I was expecting it to be just like all of the other study Bibles in that it would primarily just be a lot of notes. While there are plenty of notes in this Bible, it's the other material that I appreciate the most.    The number of \\"articles\\" contained in this Bible far surpasses any study Bible I've seen. You could make a separate book just on the articles. And they are very good. They cover a wide range of topics and present them in a balanced manner using the best scholarship. One particular article caught my attention with a section heading on Kant. I've never seen another general study Bible discuss Kant. The number, depth, and scholarship of the articles practically make this Bible a text book on the Bible and Christian theology.    The illustrations are another feature I was surprised to find myself appreciating so much. The number, size, detail, scope, and color make them a spectacular reference. Again, I haven't come across another study Bible with the number or quality of illustrations.    This is definitely the study Bible I will be recommending to people interested in really understanding all aspects of the Bible and Christian theology.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This cd, to me, is made up of everything great that Metallica has ever done.  The arrangements, the guitar work, the lyrics, the epic feel to the songs, the speed and heaviness.  This is everything they have ever done all rolled into one great album.  I often tell students that good art takes a long time to create, and you have to practice your craft to develop your skills to the point where you can create that perfect piece of art that will stand the test of time.  I believe this cd is Metallica's perfect piece of art from everything they've done previously.  I have not stopped listening to it since it came out a month ago.

B00004VVND|5.0|This movie was as great the second time as when I saw it over 30 years ago.  The acting is superb and Yul Brynner's character is cold and souless.  If you want to have a good time while seeing a movie, this is the one to see.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|After Keane's 2006 (second) album, the great \\"Under the Iron Sea\\", the band seemingly imploded, with singer Tom Chaplin off to drug rehab, and very limited touring. Not much was heard from them, until work was finally commenced on a new album, and after that long delay, here finally comes the third album.<br /><br />If \\"Prefect Symmetry\\" (11 tracks; 51 min.) were a vinyl release, it would be neatly divided up between tracks 1-6 on the A-side and 7-11 on the B-side. The A-side starts off with a very 80s sounding and stomping \\"Spiralling\\", unlike anything the band has ever done, but it works somehow. The good tracks follow: \\"The Lovers Are Losing\\" is more in traditional Keane territory. \\"Better Than This\\" is another departure, reminding me of a cross of David Bowie/Sparks from the 80s (again), but again quite nice. \\"You Haven't Told My Anything\\" is quite pleasing to the ears, as is the ballad \\"You Don't See Me\\", a beautful cap to the first half of the album. I rate the A-side 4.5 stars. The romper \\"Again and Again\\" blasts of the B-side very nicely, but then the album falters with \\"Playing Along\\". \\"Pretend That You're Gone\\" is the last highlight of the album. I rate the B-side 3.5 stars.<br /><br />In all, this is a very welcome return of Keane. No, it's not \\"Hope and Fears\\", the band has moved on, yet is staying true to its roots. I hope that they will tour the US soon. I saw the band several times in 2004-2005, and I can't wait to see how the songs from \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" will translate in a live setting.

B001AX9DT0|5.0|Gossip In The Grain, Ray LaMontagne's third album, is - like Trouble - a 5 star release in my opinion. The previous album, Till The Sun Turns Black (4 stars) was very good, too, but it didn't seem quite as true to LaMontagne's soul, it didn't seem to display his strengths quite as efficiently as Trouble. And now Gossip In The Grain...which, to these ears, is much closer to Trouble than Till The Sun Turns Black in terms of the overall sound and feel. There are no songs here to rival Trouble, Shelter, Jolene or All The Wild Horses, though Let It Be Me comes close, but I do think that this album as a whole is, at least, just as solid - perhaps even more so than the debut album.
B000EWBKKI|3.0|Stupid me.  I put this on my wish list a while back, thinking it was the Ultimate Edition on Blu-Ray.  It is not.  While all the top reviews refer to the Ultimate Edition with all the special features and bells/whistles, unfortunately that version does not exist on Blu-Ray yet.  What you get is a Blu-Ray version of the theatrical release, and that's it, no extras, no branching director's cut -- hasta la vista, baby.    Why Amazon continues to mix reviews from completely different products on the same page is beyond me, especially once people start writing reviews about the actual edition being sold.  Why not link to the reviews to avoid confusion?  It's my fault for not looking at the note underneath the review titles this time, but it's an honest (albeit noobish) mistake and I'm sure it happens frequently.    Still, for under $12 it's not a bad deal, and luckily I already have [[ASIN:B00004TRD8 Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (The Ultimate Edition DVD)]] on DVD (which I highly recommend to any hardcore FX movie fan or film student for its extensive behind-the-scenes footage and dual versions of the film).  So no real harm done.  But be warned that this Blu-Ray release is NOT the Ultimate Edition.

0380973839|3.0|As with most early science fiction efforts, with 'The Martian Chronicles' it is best to accept its overall preposterous aspects and enjoy it for other qualities, such as astute observations and criticisms of mankind.  But in 'The Martian Chronicles', a somewhat loose collection of short stories involving humans (from Earth) colonizing Mars, this reader was left wanting for something insightful or special.  Instead I found this collection of stories to be very readable, at times interesting, but also at times rather bland.  And at no time did I sense this book deserved to be considered a classic.  This would be an insult to its author who has indeed written classics (eg, 'Fahrenheit 451').      Bottom line: a somewhat forgettable book that seems to have garnered more readership than it deserves.  A near miss.
0767089820|5.0|Of all the movies I have seen that are made of Pride and Prejudice, this one is the greatest gem! I, personally, believe Jane Austin would be pleased to know it was kept so very close to her book! The cast is wonderful! The attention to detail for the costumes and settings is a joy! To all the cast, crew, directors and all involved with this project, I say A JOB VERY WELL DONE, INDEED!  For Jane Austin lovers, this is a must see!
0765316897|5.0|Brandon has established himself as a new heavy hitter in the fantasy genre. Elantris was spectacular (albeit with a few problems) and his Mistborn series is a step above that.    With the Mistborn series Brandon firmly calls out other authors of the genre - not only in terms of quality, but in terms of quantity. Writing as much and as well as he does should be a crime - one that gets him a life sentence of...more writing.    In this third Mistborn book questions are answered...and more questions are raised. Action is fast paced and for those of us male readers who need a new masculine hero (after Kelsier died), to identify with - we are given it. Combined with the female protagonist (Vin), the new hero balances the books in a way they have not been since the death of Kelsier.    The only drawback of the way Sanderson writes is his tendency to leave questions unanswered, or to raise new questions near the end of his novels. To the reader, these might seem to be promises he is expected to answer eventually. Unfortunately Brandon has yet to commit to answering them.    On a side note - as an author Brandon is incredible accessible and personable to his fans. Unlike other authors, he seems to genuinely appreciate each and every fan he has.     And that, my friends, is just one more reason for us to buy his books; we must keep him writing!

1579126278|3.0|This Agatha Christie novel is written from the family doctor perspective, who is called late one evening to examine the death of his friend, Roger Ackroyd. Christie keeps the reader guessing until the very end of the book, with many characters possessing the motive for murder. The plot is also made more difficult by narrowing the time of the murder down to 10 or 15 minutes. Various characters lack alibis for this quarter of an hour, and the famous Hercule Poirot must ferret the truth out with a grand finale gathering of all the suspects (similar to a Thin Man movie). The reader will be surprised by the ending, as the murderer in Christie novels is not usually viewed from this perspective.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|It's not nearly as good as the series, but SATC the movie does provide a nice visit with the beloved characters, and it's entertaining enough. I just wish they had done more work with the writing -- it was missing the wit and sparkle of the TV show.
0783240236|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"Seems like a pattern, doesn't it?  They strike, then disappear, and then start massing again.\\"<br /><br />The above line of dialogue is from this entertaining, suspenseful, scary, and romantic movie directed by the great Alfred Hitchcock.  He said, \\"This could be the most terrifying motion picture I have ever made!\\"<br /><br />This movie is based on the short story \\"The Birds\\" by Daphne du Maurier.<br /><br />Because of its special effects (where no computer animation was used) and apocalyptic theme, this movie influenced later \\"revenge of nature\\" films.  (It was nominated for a special effects Academy Award.)<br /><br />Briefly, Melanie Daniels (\\"Tippi\\" Hedren) is attracted to Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor).  She decides to unexpectedly visit him at his home located in a small Pacific coastal village.  In this village, she discovers three things:<br /><br />(1) Mitch has a much younger sister (Veronica Cartwright) and a possessive, widowed mother (Jessica Tandy)<br />(2) Mitch's former lover and now the village's school teacher (Suzanne Pleshette)<br />(3) The gradual strange behaviour of the birds in this village.<br /><br />Look for Hitchcock's cameo just after the opening credits.<br /><br />What makes this movie especially suspenseful is that the viewer does not know when the birds will attack.<br /><br />Those who like their movies to tell them everything as it proceeds will not like this movie.  By not telling the viewer everything, Hitchcock effectively adds another dimension to his movie.<br /><br />Two other things unique about this movie are:<br /><br />(1) It has no background music (thus adding to the suspense)<br />(2) It has no conventional ending (thus giving the impression that the events portrayed in the film are just the beginning...)<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2000) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has thirteen extras, many of which are brief but interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, don't be a birdbrain!!  Be sure to see this classic movie directed by \\"The Master of Suspense!!!\\"<br /><br />(1963;  2 hr;  wide screen;  20 scenes;  colour)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXdbrain!!

0321344758|4.0|This book compels you to think about how people use websites. I tend to think in terms of visual appeal instead of funneling visitors towards a conversion.

B000YAA68W|4.0|For its trimmed-down storytelling and visually-appealing animation style, the sub-titled Persepolis is a smart, interesting, creative movie that I enjoyed right up to its last twenty minutes, when alas it fizzled. If it had had a better ending, or even a more definite ending, it'd be five-stars all the way. I have seen Persepolis several times since buying it last month and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes an imaginative story or who wants to learn more about the Iranian Revolution, the Iran-Iraq War, or the struggle for the stifled soul to breathe free inside a fundamentalist Islamic Republic. Persepolis does a grand job of putting faces onto Iranians of the extraordinary and mundane stripe, from a charming old grandmother, to a kindly uncle tragically murdered by revolutionaries, to everyday kids lethally persecuted for trying to have party. Above all Persepolis cracks many stereotypes and shows the uniqueness and goodness in everyone, even as it stares down those who would seek to crush the human spirit in the name of their God. It also irrefutably condemns the evils of Islamism, which is merely another guise for totalitarian of an all-too familiar order. Personally I enjoyed the segments of the movie set in Iran more than I did the forays into Europe, but those too served as nice contrasts, and overall this is a film that stands above most of what's out there lusting after your ever-dwindling entertainment dollar.<br /><br />How about I call Persepolis four and a half stars and tell you you should see it?
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Dylan just keeps getting better.  This album easily ranks as one of his best. There are so many good songs on the cd that it doesn't matter which one you play.  Why this album was not up for album of the year at the Grammy's is beyond me.  Justin Timberlake's album was better than this?...c'mon.
B000H7JCG4|4.0|So with the launch of the new 90210 I decided to kick it old school and rewatch season 1. And remember why it's infinitely better than the tripe they're calling TV these days.<br /><br />In season 1, the Cindy and Jim Walsh move from Minnesota to Beverly Hills, enrolling their twins, Brenda and Brandon, at West Beverly High. Life in Beverly Hills is full of trials and tribulations that the Walsh family has no experience with, including teenage drug use, rape, shoplifting, and racial tension. Oh my! Watching this season is like taking a trip back to the 90s on the oh-so-awesome train. I'd almost forgot how tragically hip teenagers were in 1990. The outfits themselves are worth the cost of these discs. Watch season 1 of 90210 when you're in the mood for a laugh and a blast from the past.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Supernatural has been an amazing show from the very beginning and this season is no different.    Since the yellow eyed demon has been vanquished the show has evolved a new story point, How to keep Dean from going to hell.    This season, due to the writers strike is only 16 episodes long instead of the normal 22 episodes, but the way they have paced the story ark is so good you hardly notice the drop in numbers.    This show hasn't been on television in my native country of New Zealand since the end of the first season, so I will either have to wait another year for the 4th season to come out on dvd, or somehow watch it over the net.    If you liked the first 2 season of Supernatural then don't hesitate to get this season. If you haven't seen the other seasons you better watch them first. Thank you for reading my review, hoped it helped.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins summarizes every problem that I've ever had with, not only the Bible, but religion in general.    Every argument that I have ever used is in this book. It explains why the idea of \\"God\\" is illogical and explains it in a very graceful manner.    Absolute must-read.
031606792X|5.0|I read Breaking Dawn, as well as the rest of the Twilight Series, aloud with my husband.  I really loved it.  I've seen a number of reviews calling Bella immature, or that the story gives poor examples for young readers, though I disagree.  Bella's mother, throughout the series, calls her her \\"middle aged child.\\" I think this is true, even though Bella has fallen hopelessly, romantically in love with Edward, and does briefly lose it when he leaves.  I've known real middle aged, college educated, \\"mature\\" adults react similarly when separated from their loved ones, either through death or unexpected divorce.  It happens; our emotional ties are what make us human.   Bella's very human reaction to Edward leaving her shows her depth of feeling, not her lack of maturity or her youth.  Edward is over 100, and admits to her that she handled it better than he had.  No one says he's immature, even though Edward himself tells her he mostly just curled up in a ball of misery, while she at least went through the motions of life.  One could say that that sends the message that you're only allowed to have a mental breakdown after you've gotten a few college degrees.  Oh wait, it's fiction...    Another thing, why is it so terrible that they get married and had a child?  I myself was a \\"middle aged child\\"  I met my hubby shortly after graduating high school, and married him six months after my graduation.  18 months later, we had our first child-yes, he was planned.  I completely understand and know exactly what Meyer was referencing when she described the immediate love of a mother for her child, whether from the first flutter of movement, or the moment of first sight.  And yes, an 18 year old woman is perfectly capable of feeling those feelings; especially when the child has been created in a loving, committed marriage.  It's not a route that many can handle; however, it's not impossible.  My own sister had her bachelor's degree before she married and had her first child.  Maturity is not gained through college.  It is gained by living.  I'm not against education, in fact I encourage it. I just don't think it is a prerequisite to maturity.      In many ways Bella has been a parent for many years- to her own mother.  She even mother hens her father, making sure he's fed, and the home is cleaned.  I think Charlie and Renee are the example of immaturity in the story, the example of marriage for the wrong reasons.  To say that Bella is immature is not totally true.  Perhaps that she is inexperienced in romance is true, but do you have to keep squeezing all the produce in the produce section after you've found what you're looking for on the first try?    Personally, when Jacob imprinted on Nessie, I was reminded of Mr Knightley in Jane Austin's Emma.  Mr Knightley speaks to Emma about having held her in his arms as a teen-aged boy, when she was just a baby.  I never had the thought that he was a pedophile when I read that great romance.      I loved the end; I was really moved when Edward said goodbye to Jacob, when they still thought there was no hope against the Volturi. \\"Goodbye Jacob, my brother...my son.\\"  It showed the strength of their family bond.      Yes they are an unusual family, and Edward and Bella will never break off to be independent from the other Cullens, but why would they?  That doesn't teach the next generation to marry young and rich and leech off mommy and daddy.  I think it encourages strong family ties.  One could argue that the Cullen's wealth is truly dependent on Alice and her gift, not hard work and education, as educated as they may be.  So maybe that will teach the next generation to rely on psychics more... But, oh yeah, the Cullens aren't real, they are fiction, and I daresay the average reader knows that on their own.
B000CNESU8|5.0|Show a remarkable prescience for a 1976 movie, Paddy Chayefsky's brutal satire of the television nation in the not so distant future still stings the eyes. Faye Dunaway's cutthroat executive was talking reality TV almost a quarter century before [[ASIN:B0001ZDKXI Survivor's First Season]] and Peter Finch's satirical Howard Beale was the sociopathic nutjob who would eventually turn up as \\"journalists\\" like Michael Savage or Billo The Clown. \\"Network\\" was one of the first movies to win multiple Academy Awards for its actors (Finch, Dunaway and Beatrice Straight, supporting actress as William Holden's long suffering wife) plus Chayefsky's screenplay.<br /><br />Some 30 years later and the points \\"Network\\" makes still drill home. The fact that you could still make this movie today and have it be just as ruthlessly efficient speaks of its brilliance. After all, what makes \\"The Mao-Tse Tung Hour\\" all that different than a season of Jack Bauer and [[ASIN:B000MR8W92 24]]on Fox? (Even more to the point, \\"Network\\" was made when the idea of a 4'th Network other than ABC, NBC or CBS was considered ludicrous.) When Dunaway berates a news executive over his \\"sanctity of the news department,\\" she pile drivers him thusly:<br /><br />\\"I watched your 6 o'clock news today; it's straight tabloid. You had a minute and a half of that lady riding a bike naked in Central Park; on the other hand, you had less than a minute of hard national and international news. It was all sex, scandal, brutal crime, sports, children with incurable diseases, and lost puppies. So, I don't think I'll listen to any protestations of high standards of journalism when you're right down on the streets soliciting audiences like the rest of us.\\"<br /><br />Does her take on the future sound eerily like 2008? The fact is, we have long since moved to the point where the journalist is the story and the certifiable Howard Beale is golden, at least until his instability threatens his advertising stream. While that leads to the no-longer far-fetched conclusion, it also give Ned Beatty a hilariously over the top moment that briefly steals the movie. Beatty's nominated role as Head Honcho Arthur Jensen seems like Ted Turner before he became a broadcast mogul...there are so many predictions in \\"Network\\" that it seems like it came backwards in time.<br /><br />Movies influenced by \\"Network\\": [[ASIN:0780622561 Wag the Dog]], [[ASIN:B000CEXEWA All the President's Men]], [[ASIN:B0001932ZA The Running Man]].ched conclusion, it also give Ned Beatty a hilariously over the top moment that briefly steals the movie.

B000HEWEE4|3.0|I watched this movie because it was filmed near my old house. I used to stop for breakfast at a spot that overlooks the \\"lake house\\". I was expecting it to be the stupidest movie ever, but it was actually sort of cute. Even despite it's clumsy plot, refusal to resolve conflicts created by the time travel element and painfully obvious plot twist, there were parts that were sweet and silly enough to make it palatable. Overall, I think if you go in with really low expectations you may be surprised.
B0018S6YO4|5.0|Generally, one buys a CD and only likes to listen to one or two tracks. With Rihanna's CD \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" every track is different and , I think sets a new genre for music. It crosses over from R and B to light rock. A great deal of thought was put into the order of the tracks. The lyrics are full of meaning. It is a compilation of love songs, angst and confusion. I am 48 and an old rock n' roller. This CD is a crossover for me. I would highly recommend this CD.
B001BR5F4C|3.0|Great product - cant fault it, but, if buying from the UK, because of the dollar value of the product, be wary of additional charges...Customs in UK slapped another £12.98 on the cost before it could be pushed through the letter box. Read the AMAZON.COM regs re Customs Charges because the total cost incurred was way more than the UK cost from Amazon.co.uk would have been (if I could have waited the extra month) =(
0439023483|4.0|I loved this book!  The characters are well thought out and relatable.  I only wish that she would have spread this first book out a little more.  It could have been longer.  I found myself constantly wanting more detail and more insight into the characters. Maybe she only had a certain number of pages or something, or maybe she was trying to keep it in line with something that would keep a teen reader's attention.  I still wish it were longer!<br /><br />Nonetheless, it was a fantastic read, and I'm so very anxious to read more!  I can't wait for the next book!
031606792X|5.0|I don't see the issues with Breaking Dawn.  My favorites were book 1 and 3, but I felt BD was equally powerful.  Rather than see Bella \\"get everything for nothing\\", my take was that BD developed Bella and the intensely strong person I hoped/suspected she was all along, although her strenths were more latent and immature in the earlier books.  She shows the sheer determination not to flinch and scream during the extremely painful transformation, she wills herself not to pursue human scent even as a \\"newborn\\", and finally becomes an equal in the relationship, to the point of leaving the realm of the protected ward to become a protector, herself, not just of Edward, but everyone else, as well, with her unique power.  She has also become more independent agent in her own right, as illustrated by her foray to the Seattle lawyers' office.  Did you expect a fairytale romance NOT to have a happy ending?  I, for one, was happy to see Jacob back in place, where he fit better, as part of Bella's extended \\"family\\" [...] Also, an engenious way to bring Charlie back into the fold... after all, the Cullens were a family living/posing as humans.  Realizing earlier on that Edward could not actually read Charlie's thoughts, just his moods, it hit home it was a particular strength of Charlie's that Bella had enherited, so was fitting that he was utlimately able to handle things in some way.
1433502410|5.0|I just received my copy today--in genuine leather, black.  The quality of the paper and the binding is quite good, much better than most non-smythe-sewn bibles out today.  The font size is comfortable to read, and the maps and diagrams inside are absolutely beautiful!  The closest thing I have to a complaint about the ESV Study Bible is also one of its biggest strengths:  it's too darn thick!  This study bible is full of information to supplement one's understanding of Scripture.  It is so full that it is almost uncomfortable to hold!  Seriously, the team assembled by Crossway to put this bible together has done an incredible job.  Go get one!
B001CQONKY|5.0|Love Season 8...and got it on Amazon brand new factory sealed for onlt $50, including shipping, so I was quite happy with not having to pay $70-80 for it.  I love Grissolm, but Catherine is by far my favorite.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|It's Harlem, 1968, and \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson is speaking to his driver and right-hand man Frank Lucas (the amazing Denzel Washington).  Bumpy laments the loss of the middleman in business, the jobs lost to overseas companies, the end of the era of the working man.  When Bumpy dies and Frank takes over, he omits the middleman too and purchases his heroin directly from Bangkok and ships it via military aircraft through Vietnam to the US.  Frank is on his way up, and he doesn't let anyone stand in his way, even those who think now that Bumpy is dead, so is his business.<br /><br />Detective Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is an honest cop who's taking night classes to become a lawyer.  He's well aware of how corrupt the Drug Enforcement Division is, the police taking busted dope from evidence, cutting it, and reselling it on the streets.  Richie and his partner find $1M in the trunk of a dealer's car, and against his partner's warning they turn in the money.  Now they can't get backup and the other cops won't work with them because they can't trust honest cops.<br /><br />While Frank represents The American Dream (even if it's the wrong dream) by being a gentleman, a good family man who loves his mother, his wife, and America, Richie the honest cop is a failure at his marriage, a womanizer, and a absent father to his son.<br /><br />Frank's on top of the world, until an innocent gift from his wife begins his decline.  Always counseling his brothers not to dress flashy and attract attention, he makes the mistake of wearing the showy, fifty thousand dollar chinchilla coat and hat his wife gave him to a boxing match.  Sitting in better seats than the Italians, shaking hands with Joe Lewis, and standing out like a sore thumb, he catches the attention of Richie, who's heading a task force to nail all the big time drug players.  The cops are onto Frank now, both the good ones and the bad ones.  Frank is exposed, and his world is about to change.<br /><br />Though based on a true story, I've never heard of the case so I can't comment on how close to reality the film came.  The movie starts slow, and is kind of hard to get into.  Keep watching, the movie comes together and the pace quickens.  It's a movie where you'll find yourself rooting for the bad guy even though you shouldn't, because Frank seems like such a nice guy (except when he's shooting people).  It's also a movie you'll want to view again, to catch all the nuances in the relationships.  On a personal note, I liked all the old cars they found to use in the movie, not one car was outside the time frame.  This review is based on the Unrated Extended Version, not the theatrical version.  Rent first, then buy.  Enjoy!e so I can't comment on how close to reality the film came.

B0017WI5VQ|4.0|Adele is a breath of fresh air. She has a great soulful voice, which is rare now days. She sounds even better singing live, in which I first saw her on the David Letterman show. I bought the CD and was not disappointed. Her style comes from the soulful 60's and face it not many Pop Singers now days could have lasted in the talented 60's, but Adele could have.  Look out America here comes the British! My favorite songs on her CD are: Chasing Pavements (Live), Hometown Glory, and Cold Shoulder. All in all, it was a great first CD and I can't wait to hear her second CD!
031606792X|4.0|I loved this book more then the first three.  I actually finished it in three days.  The suspense was overwhelming, right up till the last chapter I thought Bella and Edward were goners.  I literally could not put the darn book down.  I don't know what everyone was expecting but I can't believe the bad reviews this book is getting.  Yes it has a \\"happy ending\\" but like most love stories people like to have \\"happy endings\\" (Pride and Prejudice, Somewhere in Time, etc.).  What was so horrible about Jacob imprinting on Nessie?  She will be an adult in less then seven years and they can get married. Until then he is the greatest babysitter anyone ever had.  He isn't getting any older himself so this works out perfectly and I was so happy he finally found his true love.  Also this will keep him in the family. I found Edward a little on the weak side in this book but other then that I was very happy with the whole thing.
B0015D3YQI|1.0|I just simply cannot believe that a serious genious/meister of horror, shock, and mystery such as Dario Argento would even have the slightest gumption to stamp his name on this Air-Borne Disease! I mean what could he have been possibly thinking?! As an established big-time fan of his work and vision this movie was without a doubt the &#34;BIGGEST MISTAKE OF DARIO ARGENTO'S CAREER&#34;!<br /><br />When I had heard about it being the one of the few chances I would get to see his lesser-known daughter Fiore Argento, also when I heard<br />that stunningly beautiful, Ageless, and JUST PLAIN HOT, to say nothing of very talented Jennifer Connelly was going to be in it as well as &#34;Halloween&#34; star Donald Pleasance, all starring in it, plus an original concept like someone who can communicate with bugs telepathically, I thought how could Dario possibly go wrong here?!  Well guess what he did everything horribly wrong!<br /><br />First of all we only see his other daughter Fiore for like maybe the first 4 minutes of the movie, when her character misses some tour bus or something and comes by some waterfall outlook point, has no real lines, and to make matters worse gets to be the murderers first victim!(Some part she had!) Well anyway I tried to shrug it off and go on. So from there we meet Jennifer Connelly's character who's name is also Jennifer(GEEZ! how creative, LOL!) And is some rich attorney's princess whom he sends to some Swiss boarding school.  And to make a long story short she meets her roommate who secretly has a boyfriend and is not the nice excepting friend she believes her to be 'cause behind her back her roommate and her roommates boyfriend laugh at her! And for what it's worth I feel that this &#34;outcast who has a special secret,  be it a supernatural power or whatever is something that's becoming quite a tiresome and overused cliche'! Not to mention that the part of the other girls being snobs against her(in particular when they and the &#34;B***h on Wheels teacher snoop around and find out her secret via a letter intended for her father)didn't even come up until considerably later! Anyway for some reason she has this ability and isn't quite sure how to use it or control it right. Eventually she meets and befriends Donald Pleasance's character who's a wheelchair bound Scottish scientist who studies bugs. As they get to know eachother more he somehow(of course)understands her bug telepathy better than Jennifer does! WHAT?!!  And he allows her not only the knowledge of how the bugs can help her find the murderer but also a fly to help her(of which for some reason he refers to as &#34;The Great Sarcophagus!) Again What?! A Sarcophagus is an Egyptian Mummy's coffin.What the hell has that got to do with a fly! If it was a beetle that would make sense but not a fly! So the wicked boarding school teacher tries to commit her because she I guess, doubts her ability to commune with bugs. Which presented the only cool scene as far as I'm concerned where she has a lot of flies come to the windows and doors of the boarding house and with an angelic glimmer and the keen theme tune playing utters the words&#34; I love you, I love you all&#34; to the flies I guess and then faints! Needless to say after she has a completely corny and way too easy time escaping she attempts to get a plane ticket out of Switzerland and upon failing to do so the only person at the school who was nice to her played by Argento's now ex-wife Daria Nicolodi giving Jennifer somewhere to stay at her house! I won't bore you all with too many details.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert***  The killer and a certain important character's demise are about to be revealed, if you don't wish to know those details ahead of time than skip this section.  To my shock and chagrin it wasn't bad enough whatwith  Donald Pleasance's untimely death at the hands of the killer but to make matters worse get this;<br /> DARIA NICOLODI's CHARACTER WAS THE KILLER THE WHOLE TIME! Not to mention Daria's character ending up being dull, bland and ONE-DIMENSIOAL! On top of that you already know she's the killer 90 minutes into the movie when there's still 15 minutes to go! Not to mention her deformed son(who quite frankly looked like a pig on acid)had some part in it!  Gosh what an ugly FREAK! One bigger problem here is that that guy she left chained to the wall was neither explained nor developed as a character!  I mean who was he? I also hate that Jennifer Connely's character has this  control over bugs yet when Daria attempts to poison her and also when she chases after her she stupidly does not use her powers until the deformed son corners her on the motor boat! And a bigger shocker is Donald's lab monkey saving her by insanely slashing at Daria with an old fashioned razor blade which was quite disturbing!  *** End of spoiler<br /><br />Anyway other than that I got sick and tired of looking at maggots all the time!I hate them!  Also, there's this whole thing about Jennifer sleepwalking.  Which seemed to me like a filler sub-plot that wasn't relevant at all.  So in closing,  there were pretty color colored lights like Dario has used in his other movies and it had a couple of annoying aforementioned plot holes!

B001DHE9KG|5.0|This is another filming of Zeffirelli's well-known La Boheme production, but it still looks fabulous. I loved what conductor Luisotti is doing with the orchestra, and it is good to have a recording of Gheorghiu singing Mimi, while her voice is still in good shape. Ramon Vargas is a good Rodolfo and baritone Ludovic Tezier is excellent as Marcello.    Highly recommended!
B00005JPO1|2.0|I am a big fan, not of the first trilogy, but of the introductory film. Intelligently plotted and written by Lawrence Kasdan with contributions from Lucas and Philip Kaufman, it was directed to the hilt by Spielberg at his most energetic and creative. It all made sense - the remarkably realistic stunts, the romance, even the pseudoreligious/historical/ sci-fi/ horror mumbo-jumbo. Much of this had evaporated in the fairly awful first sequel. Even so \\"Doom\\" had some great directorial moments such as the Hong Kong opening, and the mine- cart chase scene. Some of the energy of the first film was duplicated in the second sequel, the speedboat chases in Venice, and the general humorous interplay between Ford, Sean Connery, and the great Denholm Elliot. The unfortunately monikered Allison Doody was little improvement over the annoying Kate Capshaw in the second. Neither had the spunk and charisma of the young Karen Allen. So I was enthused to learn that the original Marion Ravenwood would return in the fourth installment. And, the initial Nevada stunt-rich warehouse scene was promising. However, it wasn't long before the horrendous over-the-top CGI-enhanced stunts kicked in, and any charm or real excitement disappeared. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the most egregious examples were the sword-jeep battle and the boat going over three - count'em - one hundred foot waterfalls with nary a moment of believability or true jeopardy between them. It amazes me that Spielberg, the most hands-on of filmmakers, who would not do \\"Jurassic Park\\" until he was convinced that ILM could produce convincing digitial dinosaurs, would approve such unconvincing digital work here so many years later. In closing, if you checkout the \\"making of\\" featurette on the single disc, you might be struck by how reluctant Spielberg was to do this film. His skepticism when Lucas mentioned doing an alien-themed picture, in light of Spielberg's then two, now three alien films, indicates that he probably should have trusted his gut. Lucas recently stated that Spielberg now seems much more ready to do an Indy 5. Let's hope that it's merely the misplaced hope of a good friend unwilling to accept that his buddy probably has more serious and interesting projects up his sleeve and, in his sixties, less energy and time to do them.
B00006CTC0|3.0|This Australian-Only Import is the one to get if you can. This Double-Disc CD includes 5 Live version songs from the shows in Madrid, Spain, and 3 videos of the singles. While we anxiously await the new release of \\"Black Ice\\", this album, recorded in 2000, was a simple and strait-forward return to the basics. \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" has the trademark attitude and energy of the band as it moved into the new century. It must be noted that AC/DC has never 'experimented' or changed their image or sound to 'fit-in' with the latest music trends. For example,Metallica tried to go for a new image and sound twice- with disasterous results.   The Boys from down-under have always been honest to their fans. This album doesn't rock as hard or loud as their early 80's stuff, but that's ok. They have nothing to prove to anyone. Just plain hard rock without any gimmicks or tricks. AC/DC rocks!
B001CC7PPI|5.0|The Dream Sequence referred to in the last review was never part of the original film. It was inserted by local television stations in a lame attempt to recapitulate the plot for those who had tuned in late.  Exactly the kind of butchering that should be prevented by copywright laws.  The current restoration is completely faithful to the original film.

The book is gorgeous, and includes the original contact sheets from the recording sessions with Coltrane, Davis, and other players.  Let's not forget the blue vinyl!  Not only is it pretty, but sounds great.  If you're looking for the perfect \\"something\\" for any music lover, this is it.  Hands down.

0375826726|4.0|As a huge fan of fantasy and sci-fi, I picked up Eragon as a passing fancy to see what someone like me would write for an epic fantasy. I fully expected Paolini to underachieve, failing miserably in his attempt to imitate great authors like Tolkien and Lewis. I was pleasantly surprised, because while his writing wasn't amazing (only to be expected because people take time to mature as writers), the book had enough pull that I was drawn to finish it as quickly as possible, and I was left with a sense to learn more about Eragon and Saphira's plight. Thus I picked up Eldest and now Brisingr.<br /><br />Brisingr is the third out of a four book series. There were a few patches where everything was quite slow, but there are enough action-packed scenes and fast narrative that more than make up for it. Usually an author would have had the main character fully matured into his role as a hero by now, but I also kind of like the bumbling hero that Eragon is being portrayed as; it reminds me of Taran from Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series. Paolini does need to step up in terms of figuring out some of the directions of the side plots (but he has the main plot well in hand it seems), and I fear that everything might become too well packaged in the last book. Deus ex Machina-type plot endings are always a turnoff.<br /><br />By now, fans of the series will definitely buy this book, and I would recommend starting the series for those on the fence. Of course, you could always pick up a copy from your local library if you do not wish to pay money for a book you might not like.
B0002EXH4A|4.0|I orginally gave this album only 3 stars saying it was a bit of a letdown after the Peace Sells album. After many further listens I believe this to be possibly the catchiest album Megadeth has in their entire catalog. Its not as technically well crafted as most of their recordings, but its just punky angst ridden immature fun and very pleasant to listen to. This album is over the top thrash playing that sounds like nuclear bombs going off mixed with simple yet effective punk thrash riffing. Plus it contains some of Megadeth's best songs including, Set the world afire- amazing and sonic, In my Darkest Hour- addictive and well written,  and the excellent closer Hook in Mouth- simple yet a mini anthem of sorts. This album also has a certain uniqueness to it not only for Megadeth but for thrash itself. What other thrash album sounds close to this, this album truly separates them from the rest and Metallica most notably. I'd say the material on this album is the polar opposite of anything Metallica has written. It sounds more like a punk meets thrash explosion. Very under-appreciated album in thrash circles, barely comparable to Rust in Peace, because it sounds nothing like it. 4.5 stars. recomended for those with an openmind.
1591840562|4.0|Because Guy Kawasaki is associated with tech and Silicon Valley, you might think his book about how to execute a start up wouldn't apply much if you're launching a dry cleaning service or a machine shop. But there is valuable information here for any business.<br /><br />No matter what you're doing, positioning, business plans, and pitching your business are essential, and Kawasaki does a great job of explaining how to do all three without going overboard.<br /><br />Another area where his insight is especially valuable is financing. His experience has taught him a lot about bootstrapping, borrowing, and other ways of raising capital. These days, when loans are hard to come by, any new business needs creative options, and Kawasaki provides several.<br /><br />He devotes a fair amount of time to branding and sales as well, but the meat and potatoes is in the areas I mentioned above. On every topic, Kawasaki provides a list of further reading recommendations for those who want more detail.<br /><br />Overall, the book is heavy on common sensical, practical suggestions. Kawasaki has been on all sides of the start up game and knows most if not all of the angles.
031606792X|5.0|I could not put these books down.  I thought they were all excellent books.  I thought the ending was so appropriate.  I just read the stories to relax and visit another place, a make believe land where magic is possible.  To me, if you're going to read a story involving vampires, werewolves, and true love, then why would you expect it to be realistic?  It wouldn't be entertaining to me if it was realistic.  Love it! Love it! Love it!
0312370849|4.0|Set in both 1942 and modern times, Sarah's Key is a mystery as well as a heartbreaking look at the round up and deportation of Jewish families from Paris to Auschwitz in what was known as the Vel d'Hiv for the place the families gathered--the Vélodrome d'hiver, or winter velodrome.    Ten-year-old Sarah Starzynski is sleeping when the Paris police bang on her apartment door.  Her family had heard of Jews being rounded up, but only the men. So Sarah's father was hidden in the basement, thinking his family was safe. But the police this night came for everyone. Sarah's four-year-old brother, Michel, stubbornly refused to go and insisted on hiding in a secret cupboard before the police saw him. Sarah locked Michel in and promised to come back when she returned.    Sixty years later, Julia Jarmond, an American journalist living in Paris, investigates the story of the Vel d'Hiv and uncovers Sarah's story when she finds out that her husband's family moved into Sarah's apartment after her family left. She is determined to find what happened to Sarah, in the process uncovering family secrets that some think would be best to leave buried.    Gripping and emotional, this fast-paced book brings to life Paris in the 1940s and in modern times. It takes a frank look at a nation and a people who for so long would not come to grips with its complicity in sending its own citizens to die in Nazi concentration camps. It also follows Julia as she delves deeper into the story while confronting conflicts of her own with her husband and his family.
1433502410|5.0|Since I believe that the ESV is the most reliable translation available today, I have eagerly anticipated the release of the ESV Study Bible(abbr, ESV/SB) with its copious notes and helps. The ESV Study Bible has its own website at [...] which offers many details about its features as well as videos and recommendations. This review is in two parts. Part 1 is my general and personal observations; Part 2 is the theological observations.     PART 1- GENERAL AND PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS(for a general reader)    1. The general look and layout of the notes is most similar to the NIV Study Bible--- This pertains to the size and color of the type and the bolding of keys words from the text. The ESV/SB has some color backgrounds in the notes that the NIV/SB does not have.    The  detail of comment is much more extensive than the NIV/SB.  The notes of the NIV/SB are quite abbreviated  in short phrase style while the ESV/SB speaks on fuller sentences and offers the potential for considerable more understanding. The language represents a balance between scholarship and readability for the lay person.      2. The notes of the ESV/SB represent the Majority of Evangelical Views--When there is consensus of opinion, the notes present what most all Evangelicals affirm. Where there is more than one opinion the general approach is: \\"some say...\\". \\"others say....\\" \\"All views have this in common...\\" Therefore the reader can learn about diversity of views within the church as well as the essentials of the Christian faith that all affirm . It is important to state  that the ESV/SB NOTES AND ARTICLES DO NOT CRITICIZE OR HARSHLY CRITIQUE A  CERTAIN VIEW WITHIN EVANGELICALISM. The various views are stated accurately and with a charitable attitude towards various views. I have seen up to 4 views presented in certain passages which is basically unprecedented.     3. A unique addition is the Online Version. Of course it can be updated in the future, but for now I find it useful in quick cross-referencing. When you place your mouse on a scripture in the notes, the first 3-lines of text appear in a pop-up box. If you click the mouse, the whole passage appears. The maps zoom in and out with a click of the mouse.     4. The ESV/SB is physically thicker  and weightier than previous study bibles . With nearly 2700 pages, it may be too heavy to carry to a church worship service or to a college classroom. Since it is considerably more comprehensive than previous study bibles, it excels in the personal study. But it can also have great value in a small group study. Since a diversity of views is clearly explained, church members from various backgrounds can see other views that may be represented  in their group.   The extensive articles in the ESV/SB equate to a  concise systematic theology and a concise theological dictionary built into the back section.  The articles on ethics are not commonly found in study bibles yet they speak with contemporary relevance.     This completes the practical portion of the review. For some, this review is ready for evaluation.   In Part 2 below, I will make some theological observations. This is designed for those who have further questions and those who are familiar with the theological terms.     Part 2 THEOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS   Calvinism vs. Arminianism--After doing an electronic word search in the article on Doctrine, I did not find the words Calvinism,  Arminianism, Reformed or Wesleyan. The article on the atonement did not include the extent of the atonement whether definite or universal. Therefore an analysis needs to be made from the notes.     The notes affirm Total Depravity and Effectual Call in John 6:44. Unconditional election of individuals is affirmed in Romans 9:11, while corporate  election is not affirmed.  John 6:40 affirms Eternal Security and Phil 2:12-13 affirms God's enabling power in the   believer's perseverance. In Heb 6:4-8, a controversial passage concerning falling away from the faith, four views are presented but eternal security is favored.    Conclusion: since JI Packer is  the General Theological Editor, it is not surprising that the notes favor Calvinism.     2. Dispensational vs. Non-Dispensational. The notes  generally favor continuity over discontinuity. Rather than making distinctions between Israel and the church, the ESV/SB uses terms such as \\"God's people\\" in both Old and New Testament. Yet throughout the notes, the Dispensational view is presented and named as such. In the interpretation of Revelation, the recapitulation approach works well for amillennial eschatology. Yet, the Dispensational view is mentioned several times in the notes which allows the reader to compare the newer view of recapitulation with the more popular Dispensational view. In the \\"70 weeks\\" of Daniel 9, the ESV/SB amazingly explains 3 Non-Dispensational views along with Dispensationalism.  There is some mention of discontinuity though.  The notes on Rom 11 allow for the possibility of identifying Jews ethnically or biologically near or at the return of Christ. The usage  of the word \\"temple\\" in Ezek 40-48, 2 Thess 2,  and Rev 11 all include the Dispensational interpretation of a future, physical temple as a possible view.     3. Minority Views--I mentioned in Part 1 that majority views within Evangelicalism are included. A minority view that is becoming more popular is Orthodox Preterism. The Preterist or AD70 version of the Olivet Discourse is not offered in the ESV/SB even though the ESV translation allows for it. For instance in Matt 24:30 the NIV imposes a bias against the AD70 view by stating that the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the SKY. The ESV states that the sign of the Son of Man will appear in HEAVEN(where Christ is presently ruling). The ESV also states that the TRIBES of the earth will mourn which allows for AD70 interpretation as well. The Preterist view is not offered in Revelation but a brief summary appears in the introduction.       I predict that  theESV/SB will enjoy wide acceptance among Evangelicals.  My   recommendation is to buy it and then email the website link shown above to all your family and friends!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|[[ASIN:B000R7GKQE Supernatural - The Complete Second Season]]    Living out in rural Australia you can't get this show. So having seen the first season on TV I had to own the next one. All I can say is that this show never fails to impress. Will be owning the third and the fourth season...
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I had to watch this season on DVD, but I'm just glad I didn't have to see a hint of a stupid commercial!!! But this season was amazing, though the writer's strike cut it to 16 episodes.  The real picture of the demons, hell itself and the uncertain future of the two boys really comes to life than in the past two seasons.      Also, you can't help but fall in LOVE with Jensen Ackles and the sexy Jared Padalecki!  Both are very talented actors who use their physical and mental emotions come to life, especially to the highest level in the last three episodes.  I can't give anything away for those who haven't seen this yet, but this is an amazing gateway for what's to come!      Season 1 really had the jumpy scares and elaborate creatures, Season 2 had the real psychological questions and keeps you guessing, and Season 3 really lets the demon come out and have their fun.  Relationships are tested to the most tense level, and the finale is really emotional!  What they've shown of Season 4 on TV just tells you the next couple seaons are going to be BIG!!!  This is the best show on the CW (no offense but others suck...), and goes beyond the boundaries of paranormal television shows.  Just like the title says: HOT guys, blood and demons... What more can you want???
B001F7MSG6|5.0|If you liked Pans Labyrinth and the first Hellboy you owe it to yourself to check this one out.
B001DUJNGS|3.0|I've only listened to Enigma for a couple of years now and was hooked from the beginning, first listening to \\"Push the limits.\\" I've purchased every album since first encountering the artist. I looked forward to \\"Seven Lives Many Faces\\" with much enthusiasm. Now listening to the album, I've been somewhat dissapointed with the different approach. Its not as errotic and spiritual as previous albums. Cretu sings on the album, but in a different way. The only way to describe it is certain tracks performed by a singer accompanied by instrumentals- not the other way around which was a valued high point in other albums. I wish his wife had more time on the album too. Its still good to own and perhaps by latching onto a couple of tracks from the cd, the album as a whole will be understood and enjoyed.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Temple of Doom is no longer the worst of the Indiana movies.  Enough said.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Quite simply put, this is the most amazing love story on the planet. Complex, deep character personalities dissolve with purity of affection.
B00002E224|5.0|Item arrived in excellent condition and well within the promised receiving date. I am very happy with this transaction and purchase.
0439023483|5.0|I went straight to get this book after Stephenie Meyer's recomendation on her website.  Great suspense read! It'll keep you up all night wanting to know what will happen next. It's odd to think this will be a series for the way it ends but I guess we'll have to wait to find out what happens next!
0375826726|3.0|Following the events in Eldest, Eragon and Saphira have joined Roran and try to free his fianc&eacute;. But after returning to the Varden, Eragon soon faces another battle with his brother Murtagh. Eragon realizes that Galbatorix must be providing Murtagh with extra power somehow. And Galbatorix has another surprise in store for the Varden, as his soldiers no feel no pain and can keep fighting even after sustaining serious blows.<br /><br />Eragon continually finds himself torn between all the promises he has made. He must protect the Varden, help his dwarf clan with the choosing of their new king, return for final training with his dragon rider master, and discover a way to overthrow Galbatorix.<br /><br />Brisingr focuses on Roran a great deal, with his growth and battles. I found myself enjoying his character a great deal more in this book. Though, Saphira has become one of my least favorite characters, as she seems to have little personality and no sense of humor. This is a major disappointment, since she's a central character and one of the few dragons left.<br /><br />The story also gets bogged down quite a bit with the traveling and time with the dwarves. I felt the descriptives could have been cut back quite a bit, and made for a smoother read.<br /><br />But the action and adventure were very entertaining. And some big revelations lead to exciting and stirring results. Brisingr has a climactic ending, with a predictable but moving outcome. The odds are stacked against Eragon and the Varden. And Galbatorix seems undefeatable. The fourth and final chapter in this epic cycle can't come soon enough.
B001C08RHA|2.0|The Single Disc Version of this DVD is not Amoriphic...it's the skinny Widescreen so many of us hate.  Go ahead and pay a bit more (if you can) for the 2 Disc Special Edition...which...I hope I'm right...is the Wide Widescreen (Amoriphic).    Hope you notice this!
B00005JPS8|3.0|So you have a superhero who tells everyone who he is. Why not paint a bullseye on his back. Its one thing if your powers are obvious such as the F4 but to tell the world you developed this amazing combat suit is plain dumb. What kind of sequel can they make out of this.? Beats me.    The Suit though was cool and sleek. A very good interpetation of the Iron Man Comic Uniform. Overall a decent plot, been done before though with the trusted manager turning out to be a crumb and turncoat. An Ok film with a defeatist ending imho.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a good movie and I am happy with the price I paid and it arrived very quickly. I would buy from this seller again and would recommend them to friends.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|This is like watching an accompanying movie for a Disney ride or something, its seems really shoddy. Best example is the scene where Marion and Indy start sinking in quicksand. Just watch that awful scene, even if it was in an older Indy movie it would have at least looked better. Is it the lousy LEGO sets? The bright cheery color scape (where the EPIC shadowing go?) could be a problem as well maybe? Or the fact the movie is one CGI gag after another, THIS IS NOT STAR WARS. TRY TRY TRY TRY to make it somewhat believable, a slow thoughtful pace doesn't hurt either, and oldschool un-ridiculous flesh and blood stunts are nothing to be ashamed of, and a semi serious attempt at story wouldn't have hurt either. This was like a terrible big budget sitcom, only you know the budget didn't make it any better. Go You Tube the Indy Tribute movie made by those two kids on VHS tape over a span of 13 years or more, from when they were little to 20 something, its far more stunning than this.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|The movie arrived on time and works great. I would make another purchase from this seller.
B00000G3PA|4.0|This movie is one of the silliest, dumbest movies I have ever seen. When I saw this film, it was apparent that no thought, no research, no intelligence went into the writing at all.  Let's start with the basic premise of the film. An asteroid is discovered and we have 17 days until it hits. What do we do? In the real world, we bend over and kiss our butt goodbye. There is absolutely *no* way a mission such as this could be planned, trained-for and executed in this time. 17 days wouldn't be enough time to prepare a standard shuttle launch, much less one with this type of mission. This movie blindly ignores this fact.  I am always distressed when films treat people as mere cattle, props to use while pounding a point home and then forget. In the open of the movie, New York is hit with a barrage of fragments, presumably causing untold death and injury. In the real world, people might even see fit to comment upon this with the people they meet. In Armageddon, this scene is presented as eye-candy (it *does* look pretty good) and then is promptly forgotten by everyone involved. No one talks about it. No one cares.  There is so much that is wrong with Armageddon. The science involved in splitting an Asteroid the \\"size of Texas\\" with a nuclear bomb implanted only 800 feet into surface (trust me, when you have driven 800 feet into Texas, you haven't driven very far.) The idea that that bomb could divert the two large fragments enough to cause them to miss the Earth in the time they had left. The amazing \\"gravity\\" on the asteroid.  The thing is, I can enjoy a good fantasy movie. Films do not always have to work by the rules of the reality I live in. I can accept \\"The Force\\" and other such fanciful ideas, as long as the movie is true to its own reality. But Armageddon chose to place itself in *our* reality, and should have attempted to follow the rules that apply here.  Put simply, this movie is pure trash. It was by far the worst movie I saw in 1998, a year rife with embarrassing tripe. Save your time, save your money, save your brain. Don't see it.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|The movie arrived on time and works great. I would make another purchase from this seller.
044022425X|4.0|I gobble down books. Drums of Autumn, while a laudable addition to the Outlander series, was not a book I couldn't put down. In fact, I did. It took me over a week to finish, with one large sitting at the beginning and a larger one at the end. For fans of the series only.<br /><br />***Spoilers*** In short, Jamie and Claire, newly reunited, are now settled in North Carolina's extensively described wilderness (and, though a NC horticulturalist myself in the heart of scrub-forest country, I have never waxed so fully on the beauty of pine savannas nor do I ever plan to) - an action in and of itself taking a 1/3rd the novel. Much of the rest is devoted to their daughter, Brianna, and her would-be lover Roger trying to find the pair in the past, and the Comedy of Errors that results once everyone finds everyone else, however unknowing all parties to having found each other. *** End Spoilers***<br /><br />All in all, as before stated Drums of Autumn proves to be Outlander's weakest link. And, as fond as I am of this series, it still only gets 4 out of 5.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|This movie is so cute! The movie arrived on time and works great. I would make another purchase from this seller.
B0019KWE6S|5.0|If you enjoy David Sylvian, you will enjoy The Opiates Revised. The music is captivating. Like Sylvian, he comprises every song with multiple instruments without it becoming overbearing.
0143038583|5.0|\\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" takes the title from the concept that eating can be risky -- is that a good mushroom or will it make me sick? You have to take chances to learn about food, or find some other way to test it. Pollan follows the most common food ingredients through the chain and, ultimately, I think that what he has uncovered is that the Standard American Diet is making us sick.<br /><br />This isn't exactly news -- Pollan's story and the way he illustrates the food chain, processing and consumption patterns is engaging and moves along at a great pace. It feels more like a description of a personal journey which I think would make this very appealing to a lot of people. It's not very didactic, and there are some funny parts in there. The chapters on hunting and mushroom hunting gave me some giggles.<br /><br />Bottom line - don't eat processed food, support local farmers, even if they aren't necessarily organic (ask about \\"pesticide free\\" produce) and stop eating things that aren't food.
0439023483|5.0|Suzzane Collins has penned a gripping novel that will have you mesmerized from the moment you start it until you're finally able to put it down hours and hours later.  Sure, you'll go to work tired or be exhausted at school, but your temporary lapses of concentration will have been well-worth it.  This book is a little bit like The Running Man, by Stephen King. Both stories are about a future in our country where people battle to the death to win food.  This book is more intelligent and more memorable.
0736698701|4.0|wow what an incredible book! After watching the movie I rushed out and bought the book and I'm so glad I did. This isn't the type of movie or book that I normally read but I'm a fan of looking at Gerard Butler, who's in the movie, so I decided to rent it. The characters are easy to like and the love story is so touching. I laughed and cried the entire way through. I recommend the movie but there are major differences between the two so if that sort of thing bothers you then better to only read the book. The book is just so much richer and more full of life. I can't say enough good things about it. If you're ever in the mood for a heartwarming, love story this is the book for you.
B00005JLZN|5.0|This was truly and exceptional movie. It's really beyond my understanding why it didn't hit the silver screen.   There will always be debates on the topic of capital punishment, and death penalties. This movie did a remarkable job protesting against capital punishment.     After all the debates on national television, and protesting out on the streets, David Gayle realized if you don't stand for something, you will definitely fall for anything.  After his voice continued to be ignored, he allowed his actions to speak for his beliefs.     This is differently a \\"must see\\" film!
B001D08SK0|5.0|IT'S A HANDSOME COLLECTION, NO DOUBT! I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT MORE SUPERIOR PACKAGING NEEDED TO BE THERE? IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO WHAT SOME REVIEWERS HAVE SAID. UNFORTUNATELY(AND MOST FORTUNATELY)* THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER STUDIO OUTTAKES OF THE TRACKS, AS NEARLY ALL THE TRACKS WERE 'FIRST TAKES'WHICH MAKES THE FALSE STARTS AND OTHER SURVIVING SNIPPETS INTERESTING TO PONDER UPON. HARKING BACK TO *\\"THE MOST FORTUNATELY\\" STATEMENT FROM ABOVE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SPONTANEITY AND GREATNESS OF IT RESULTED IN THE LACK OF OTHER ALTERNATE TAKES WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS TRULY A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE... BUT WHICH WILL ALWAYS MAKE US BEG FOR MORE... IT IS TRULY HISTORIC AND PHENOMENAL THAT THE ALBUM WAS MADE WITH THE COLLECTIVE BRILLIANCE WITHOUT THE THOUGHT OF TRYING TO COGITATE OVER SPONTANEOUS CREATION AND CREATE MORE OUTTAKES!... KIND OF BLUE WILL LIVE ON AS LONG AS THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH... KAISER.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Great as always.  If you like Toby Keith-you'll enjoy this CD.  It has all of his greatest hit.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|He's simply amazing - there are no words, no comparisons.  LaMontagne is forging his own genre and voice.  Gossip in the Grain is rare - in that it is completely worth buying the ENTIRE CD rather downloading a few songs on Itunes (as I do with most artists.)         If you like acoustic, folk rock, soulful riffs and deep lyrics that comfort (especially if you are down), seduce and soothe -check out Gossip in the Grain and his prior two CDs.     LaMontagne remains one of the few talented REAL musicians still out there genuinely devoted to his craft; he's not about attracting fame and attention or staging publicity stunts to garner hits.     I truly love his music and am so happy he is finally touring North America.  I haven't felt this strongly about a musician or seeing a concert since forever.  I normally don't write Amazon reviews but LaMontagne's music and talent has moved me so much, I feel compelled to make others aware of this artist.
1590200918|4.0|Susan Hill's latest novella recalls the famous Edwardian ghost stories of M. R. James and the Benson brothers as much as her famous previous short novel THE WOMAN IN BLACK recalled the Victorian ghost stories of Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Henry James and John Meade Falkner. We have here many of the more familiar tropes of M. R. James's ghost stories--tales within tales, multiple narrators, bachelor antiquarians in rooms at Oxbridge, and a woman possessed by a burning revenge--and in terms of atmosphere Hill is pretty faultless. But the novella leaves too much unclear in its telling. Although you want a certain amount of mystery preserved at the end of a ghost story, there's just too much muddled at the end of this to really get the effects Hill strives for--so while most of the story is quite a page turner, the final narrative section leaves you a bit unsatisfied.
1591841992|5.0|When Dan Roam wrote The Back of the Napkin, he probably never thought he was writing a book for entrepreneurs. But that is exactly what he did. The book is about discovering ideas, developing ideas, and selling ideas. That is the entrepreneurship process. That is the way to develop entrepreneurial ideas and the foundation of the entrepreneurial mindset.<br /><br /> I was recently involved in a training program that used this visual thinking process to design marketing programs for Internet entrepreneurs. I was super impressed with how clear they made the process and went looking for the book.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, I find The Back of the Napkin to be a perfect explanation of what I have discussed with friends and colleagues over the years on how to develop an entrepreneurial mindset and how to evaluate and implement entrepreneurial ideas.<br /><br />A key goal of the book, as Dan Roam expresses it in the book, is to help people think of visual thinking as being like a Swiss Army knife that you can carry with you anywhere to tackle problems as they come to you. This concept will be revolutionary as it becomes more visible to entrepreneurs. Global Entrepreneurship Week is one example of a newfound world-wide effort to encourage young people to embrace entrepreneurship as a tool to solve the challenges of the world. The Back of the Napkin equips people, young and old, to take up that challenge.
B00133KFGW|4.0|To be honest, I really wasn't expecting much when my wife and I sat down to watch this movie.  I was so wrong.  This is a good movie with a touching story, good music and more importantly, a great message.<br /><br />August Rush is not just a story about a boy prodigy who tries to reconnect to his parents through a shared gift of music.  No, this is a story that teaches a lesson about being true to yourself and listening to those strong feelings that we all have from within.<br /><br />Of course we are all not blessed with the musical genius that \\"August\\" possessed, but we do all have something from within that we can and should be passionate about, something we should have absolute and unwavering belief in.  We just need to listen to that inner voice and pursue that dream rather than following the masses because it is the \\"right\\" thing to do.<br /><br />I thought the actors were well cast and for the most part were believable.  The story itself left me shaking my head a couple of times but that is okay- I still enjoyed it and the music was great.  Overall I think it is a movie that is well worth watching.  Especially if the embedded lesson is transferred.
B000P1QMZ6|4.0|Note: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the same film as [[ASIN:B00003CXI1 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]]. The film just uses the original U.K. title rather than the U.S. title.    In 1997, unknown author J.K. Rowling had her first novel published. Not only was it an intelligent and highly imaginative fantasy story, but it also served as the first book in a seven-part series. [[ASIN:155192398X Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] (later renamed [[ASIN:054506967X Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for American readers]]) renewed children's interest in reading and became an international bestseller, receiving high acclaim and multiple awards. The book became a cultural phenomenon and after the publication of its sequel, [[ASIN:0439554896 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets)]], a film adaptation was inevitable. Harry Potter was one of the most sought after properties in cinematic history, and attracted the attention of Hollywood's biggest names. Ultimately, Chris Columbus directed the film, from a screenplay by Steve Kloves.    When Harry Potter was only a year old, his parents were mysteriously killed and he was sent to live with his mother's sister's family, the extremely unpleasant Dursleys. From an early age, young Harry Potter proved to be an unusual child. Once while on a visit to the zoo, Harry accidentally made a pane of glass disappear letting loose a python, which scared his obnoxious cousin Dudley half to death.  On Harry's eleventh birthday, a half-giant named Hagrid explains that Harry's mother was a witch and his father was a wizard and that Harry's been invited to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry also learns that his parents did not die in a mysterious car crash as he had been told, but rather they had been killed by the notorious Dark Lord, Voldemort, often referred to as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Hagrid accompanies Harry to London and from there to Diagon Alley, where magical supplies can be bought. Harry buys his first wand, his spellbooks, and Hagrid even gives him a snowy white owl named Hedwig. From there he's off to Hogwarts by way of the Hogwarts Express, a bright red train, which leaves from Platform 9¾ at King's Cross Station. While waiting for the train Harry meets a large wizarding family, the Weasleys, and befriends their youngest son Ron while on the train. Harry and Ron also meet Hermione, a clever but often snobby young girl.  After arriving at Hogwarts Castle, Harry and the other first year students are sorted into one of four houses. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are placed into Gryffindor, a house that is renowned for having courageous and loyal students. Harry meets the different teachers: the kind yet stern Professor MacGonagall, the malicious Professor Snape, twitchy and nervous Professor Quirrell, and the wizened and eccentric headmaster Dumbledore. Harry soon learns that each teacher treats him differently. MacGonagall, despite her chilly demeanor is very clearly fond of Harry, but Snape on the other hand seems to have a vendetta against Harry. Harry also learns of a rivalry between the school houses of Gryffindor and Slytherin, and this rivalry is exemplified by an arrogant bully named Draco Malfoy.  One day Harry, Ron, and Hermione get lost in the castle and come across a room that's being guarded by a three-headed dog. Harry, Ron, and Hermione soon learn that the dog is guarding a series of hidden passageways and rooms, where something called the Philosopher's Stone is being stored. The Philosopher's Stone has the power to make whoever possesses it immortal. After a bit of late night investigating, Harry comes to believe that someone, probably Snape, is trying to steal the stone for Lord Voldemort. With the stone, Voldemort would be restored to his full power and he would again terrorize the world of magic. Can Harry, Ron, and Hermione prevent Voldemort's return and who can Harry trust in this world full of magic and intrigue?    Adapting suchan inventive and detailed story would prove difficult, and yet the film is successful as it manages to include almost all of the important characters and events from Rowling's novel.  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone became a worldwide blockbuster and set Box Office records. There are a number of reasons for the film's colossal success. One of those reasons is the group of highly talented special effects artists that were gathered in order to create the style and look of the film. Also making a huge contribution were the experts who designed the costumes, the props, the sets, and the general atmosphere of the film. But the person who deserves the most credit is Rowling herself, who created an immaculate fantasy world that holds a universal appeal for both children and adults.  The extraordinary cast includes veteran British actors, as well as some talented young unknowns (who aren't unknown anymore). The cast features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore.  Though the film is a marvelous attempt at turning Rowling's novel into a physical reality, it does have its flaws. Much of the time the special effects are unconvincing, which wouldn't be so bad if they weren't used as the centerpiece of almost every scene. Another problem, and this is a very minor problem, is that some of the younger cast members under emote, or give stiff and forced performances. However, the acting will improve with each successive Harry potter film.  Ultimately, Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts will be remembered and treasured by fans of all ages for many years to come.    I also recommend [[ASIN:B00005OWIU the spectacular soundtrack by John Williams]].
0451160916|5.0|The Shining is a great book, if you have enough time to read it. I have only gotten about half-way through it, and had to stop to finish up another book. I do believe that anyone can read this book, and it is a privilage to do so. When I am caught up with my reading, I will finish this interesting book. :D
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Three years have passed since audiences thrilled to the exploits of the Caped Crusader in [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins]] and now writer/director Christopher Nolan ([[ASIN:B00006IUL7 Insomnia]] and [[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]]) brings us the second chapter in the unfolding Batman saga. Rather than creating a sequel that relies entirely on action, Nolan has decided to go another route. The Dark Knight is even more intense, violent and psychologically complex than its predecessor.     In the last few minutes of Batman Begins Lieutenant Gordon warned Batman of a new threat to Gotham's safety: The Joker. Now we learn how much of a threat he is. The Joker is revealed to be a psychotic criminal mastermind devoted to creating chaos whenever and wherever possible. And Batman becomes desperate to stop him. It's this desperation that drives him to use questionable methods in his nightly battle against crime. But The Joker is a master of manipulation and he's counting on Batman to up the ante. When he does The Joker takes advantage of the situation. He makes himself the central figure in Gotham's criminal underworld and soon even members of the mob become fearful of him. Batman begins to question whether or not he can endure such hardships without being weakened or corrupted. He sees that Gotham needs a new hero, a leader who will in any situation do the right thing for the people. He believes Harvey Dent to be that hero. Harvey is an idealistic D.A. and a social crusader. He's also dating Rachel Dawes, who still loves Bruce but cannot be with him so long as he is Batman. This is why Bruce begins to ask himself if the time has come to pass the torch on to another. But is Harvey Dent really the man to succeed Batman? Is he as noble as people believe him to be? Or is there something dark and terrible lurking in the psyche of \\"Gotham's White Knight\\"? If so The Joker will only be happy to exploit it. And he does so in grand fashion. Tragedy strikes and someone close to Bruceis left dead (I'm not telling who) and Bruce decides that Batman is no longer needed, that he's become part of the problem and not the solution. Harvey's sense of justice is perverted and he becomes a maniacal vigilante who is obsessed with chance and flips a coin to determine his actions. It's clear that only Batman can stop him and The Joker, who delights in creating moral dilemmas for his victims before killing them. But can one man make a difference or is Harvey right? Is it just a matter of time before even Batman's corrupted?    As with the first film, The Dark Knight features an extraordinary cast including Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Heath Ledger as The Joker, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow. Other cast members include Eric Roberts, Anthony Michael Hall and Michael Jai White. Every member of the cast is great, but especially Maggie Gyllenhaal who replaces Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's love and Heath Ledger who is phenomenal as the psychopathic Joker. The Dark Knight is an amazing follow-up to Batman Begins and takes the \\"comic book film\\" to a whole new level of depth. It's easily one of the darkest superhero movies* I've seen, but that's what makes it brilliant. Christopher Nolan has made a disturbing, superhero tragedy that will in time redefine the genre. If Batman Begins was the philosophical Batman film then The Dark Knight is its sociological counterpart. There can be no knowing what the future holds for Gotham's Caped Crusader, but so long as Christopher Nolan is helming this series you can be sure that there are still many surprises in store.    * = I would strongly advise parents to take caution before letting their children watch this film. It contains scenes of intense action, brutal violence and presents viewers with moral questions to which it doesn't necessarily give any answers.

B00008973A|4.0|A very good movie. A precursor to the play at the Hippodrome Theatre in Baltimore.
B000W74EQC|4.0|In 1997, unknown author J.K. Rowling had her first novel published. Not only was it an intelligent and highly imaginative fantasy story, but it also served as the first book in a seven-part series. [[ASIN:155192398X Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]] (later renamed [[ASIN:054506967X Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]] for American readers) renewed children's interest in reading and became an international bestseller, receiving high acclaim and multiple awards. The book became a cultural phenomenon and after the publication of its sequel, [[ASIN:0439554896 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]], a film adaptation was inevitable. Harry Potter was one of the most sought after properties in cinematic history, and attracted the attention of Hollywood's biggest names. Ultimately, Chris Columbus directed the film, from a screenplay by Steve Kloves.    When Harry Potter was only a year old, his parents were mysteriously killed and he was sent to live with his mother's sister's family, the extremely unpleasant Dursleys. From an early age, young Harry Potter proved to be an unusual child. Once while on a visit to the zoo, Harry accidentally made a pane of glass disappear letting loose a python, which scared his obnoxious cousin Dudley half to death.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll admit I'm a sci-fi junky.  I love Battlestar Galactica, and I'm a huge StarGate SG1 fan, so I'll give pretty nearly any sci-fi a shot.  When I sat down to watch Firefly, however, I was amazed.    The characters are rich and complex, the plotlines fun, interesting, and exciting, and the dialogue is top-notch.  If you haven't seen Jayne offering \\"Vera\\" to Captain Mal, then well you simply haven't seen some good story-telling!    Firefly is an incredibly rich and wonderful story first and foremost about interesting and complicated characters, who simply happen to be travelling through space.  I declined calling it a TV series as it is far more than that.    Give Firefly a try -- I'm certain you won't feel let down!
B00008DDXC|4.0|After the phenomenal success of J.K. Rowling's [[ASIN:0439434866 first four Harry potter novels]] and the first Harry potter film, there was no doubt that the boy wizard would be returning to the big screen. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, we are given a darker tale that explores the pasts of Hogwarts' students and professors. It was with this story that author J.K Rowling first began to experience a backlash from more conservative parents. Most were disturbed by the themes of death and violence, which Rowling insisted was her way of being more realistic and that by including these themes her books would be grounded in a universal reality. However some parents did not accept her explanation. They even went so far as to suggest that Satanism and a belief in witchcraft inspired the Harry Potter books and films. At first deeply insulted and angered by these preposterous accusations, Rowling later would dismiss them with her signature wit and sense of humor.  Furthermore this ridiculous controversy had no affect on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' Box Office intake. The film was a hit!    As Harry Potter prepares for his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he is warned of a dangerous plot against the students. He's told of this plot by a manic house-elf named Dobby, who is forced to inflict injuries upon himself whenever he disobeys his master. Between bouts of self-abuse, Dobby explains that his allegiance to the wizard family that owns him prevents him form saying anymore, but he is adamant that Harry Potter should not return to Hogwarts, for Harry's own protection. Harry, obstinate as ever, tells Dobby that he must return to school, so Dobby goes about creating obstacles to prevent this. Dobby, it turns out, has been stealing Harry's mail, making him believe that his friends weren't writing him over summer holiday. Dobby did this in hopes that Harry might not be so eager to return to school if he thought his friends no longer cared about him, but this wasn't the case. After Dobby gets Harry into trouble and Harry's uncle Vernon locks him in his room, Harry's best friend Ron comes to the rescue. Ron and his brothers, Fred and George, show up at the house in a flying car and save Harry from the monotony of staying with his ill-tempered relatives.  Ron and his brothers take Harry to their small home in the English countryside, where Harry meets the rest of the Weasley family. Harry and the Weasleys go to Diagon Alley, where magical supplies can be bought, to buy all of the children's materials for the upcoming year at school. They bump into school bully Draco Malfoy and his father, Lucius, who harass the Weasley children for being poor.  When Harry and Ron are unable to take the train to Hogwarts, they take the flying car and are seen by muggles (non-magic folk), not to mention the fact that they crash into the school's Whomping-Willow tree. As punishment they are given detention. While Ron is given the task of polishing medals and trophies, Harry must assist the new self-obsessed teacher, Professor Lockhart respond to his fan mail. But that's the least of Harry's problems. Harry begins to hear an eerie voice reverberating through the walls, and he follows it and it leads him to a message written on the wall in blood. \\"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir... beware,\\" it reads.  As Harry, Ron, and Hermione uncover the meaning of this cryptic message, they realize that no one at Hogwarts is safe. An evil from the past has been awakened and students begin to turn up, literally, petrified. Soon no one can be trusted and some are even pointing the finger at Harry, but when Hermione and Ron's sister, Ginny become victims and the safety and freedom of all at the school is jeopardized, Harry must prove his innocence and save his friends. But can he find the Chamber of Secrets before it's too late?    As with the first film, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was written by Steve Kloves and directed by Chris Columbus. The film is more selective in what content is included from the book, but overall it is a very successful adaptation. In many ways this film is superior to the first film. The special effects surpass those in [[ASIN:B000W74EQC Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone]] in realism, detail, and style.  The acting has also improved as can be seen in the children's performances. On a sad note, the brilliant actor Richard Harris, who plays Headmaster Dumbledore, passed away shortly after the film's completion. The cast features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ronald Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley, Kenneth Branagh as Professor Lockhart, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, and Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore.  Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts tests his courage and his skills while showing viewers that greater challenges are to come.    I also recommend [[ASIN:B00006IR5S the superb soundtrack by John Williams]].
B000AP04L0|5.0|This is one of those movies that I can watch time and again and still find new funny parts of the dialog. The script is brilliant and the acting is great. My wife makes fun of me watching the movie for the 10th time yet she can't resist joining me and she definitely finds it funny! Seems like every time I quote the movie when i am around friends and co-workers people recognize the quote which tells you how popular the movie is. I'd highly recommend checking it out if you have not!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Personally, I've never been a big fan of movie musicals, though there have been a few exceptions. One of those exceptions is Joel Schumacher's marvelous film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Weber's The Phantom of the Opera. The lavish production perfectly captures the excitement of the stage, while cleverly exploiting the cinematic medium for maximum impact. The film showcases impressive costumes, awesome sets, and an unexpectedly terrific cast, which reenergizes the music with a youthful vitality that is sometimes absent in stage productions. Of the cast, the real showstopper is young Emmy Rossum, whose porcelain skin, gorgeous brown eyes, and breathtaking vocals lend an urgency and sympathy to the character of the Phantom, who is played by Gerard Butler. The rest of the excellent cast includes Patrick Wilson as Raoul, Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry, Jennifer Ellison as Meg Giry, and Minnie Driver as Carlotta. All are superb in their respective roles. Many of the songs have been updated slightly to suit the vocal capabilities of the actors, as well as to achieve greater emotional investment with the characters. Every member of the cast does their own singing (or so says the press release), which is astonishing when you consider that most of the actors have never sung professionally before.<br /><br />Orphaned at age seven, when her famous violinist  father passed away, Christine Daae was raised by Madame Giry in the Paris Opera Populaire. From a young age she showed great promise as both a singer and a dancer. The secret to her talents can be partly attributed to a mysterious voice that she's heard since the death of her father. This voice guides her and tutors her with her singing, but little does she suspect that it is the voice of Erik, the Phantom of the Opera. The Phantom lives deep beneath the opera house  where he uses his ingenious talents to orchestrates all to ensure Christine's success. But when Christine's childhood friend, the now handsome and dashing Raoul returns and expresses his love for Christine, the Phantom grows jealous and his wrath echoes throughout the Opera Populaire. The Phantom, filled with anger and consumed by possessive passion, kidnaps Christine and takes her to his cavernous underground lair. After unmasking him and revealing a disfigured face, the Phantom lets Christine go. Then he sends a threatening note declaring that Christine should replace Carlotta, an obnoxious prim Donna and the star of the latest opera, but when the new owners of the opera disregard the Phantom's note, he disrupts the performance on opening night. The Phantom kills a stage hand, and sabotages Carlotta's performance, practically destroying her career. Meanwhile Raoul plans to take Christine away from the opera house before misfortune should befall her too, but the Phantom won't allow it. The Phantom sets into action a plan that will guarantee that he and Christine won't be separated... ever. Yet Christine, torn between Raoul and the Phantom, is left to make the decision of a lifetime.<br /><br />The screenplay, which was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumacher, is based upon the musical written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Charles Hart, and Richard Stilgoe. The musical was inspired by the serial novel written by Gaston Leroux, though much has been changed in order to create a more romantic atmosphere.<br />Stylistically, The Phantom of the Opera has no equal as the production design is immaculate and unlike anything seen in film before. And as I've mentioned before the lavish costumes, which were designed by Alexandra Byrne, help to set the tone of the film. The lighting and cinematography are also spectacular. In fact, it's hard to find any significant flaws in the film, at least not from a technical standpoint.<br />My only complaint is that some of the actors have difficulty adapting the acting style of the stage to that of the screen. However, this is a very minor annoyance and the majority of the cast is superb, especially Emmy Rossum as Christine and Gerard Butler as The Phantom. Both should be deeply proud of their impressive work in this film.<br />Without a doubt, The Phantom of the Opera is a classic.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br />[[ASIN:1932983139 The Phantom Of The Opera]] by Gaston Leroux<br />[[ASIN:B0000AKY58 The Phantom of the Opera]] (original 1925 Universal Studios film)<br />[[ASIN:078324097X Phantom of the Opera]] (original 1943 Universal Studios remake)<br />[[ASIN:B000G6BLGA The Rocky Horror Picture Show / Shock Treatment]]<br />[[ASIN:B00027JZ3E The Lost Boys]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005QZ7U Moulin Rouge]]<br />[[ASIN:B0013D8LOU Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]<br />[[ASIN:B000654YWY The Phantom of the Opera: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]
0060555661|4.0|The author's suggestions are really good. Without a finance background, I was able to understand quiet a bit of what was said. In some topics, the commentary by Jason Zweig helps understand what Benjamin Graham was trying to convey.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|I could not watch the whole movie as I found it boring and not credible in parts (when Tessa erupts in an outburst at a lecture). Fiennes' character's reaction was not believable as Tessa came across as a petulant brainwashed student spouting all the rhetoric one is so used to hearing (and with le carre's  predictable bias - USA bad UK bad WAR bad, blah blah...) I found Tessa's character cloying and could not identify enough with anyone in this film to make it thru the end. Glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't waste my $ on it.
0790729369|5.0|\\"Madison bridge county\\" was for Eastwood a truly turning point along the films of his successful career.<br /><br />This romantic movie has a factor so crucial that becomes the main strength. The presence of the pleasant and hyper talented actress Merryl Streep, the most natural actress in the last five decades in U.S.A. And I think to myself Eastwood grew up as actor with such partner.<br /><br />The classic script is supported, improved and even enhanced by her superb skills. Bear in mind, for instance, her corporal and sign language enrich the inner world of this unsatisfied woman, whose desire resides in being kept in mind regarded and respected far beyond her place as wife and mother.<br /><br />On the other hand, the subtle camera use is admirable, intimate and extremely depictive. Every frame and every shot before the unerring encounter talks by itself.<br /><br />It's obvious this movie is a clever spin of the famous David Lean's \\"Brief encounter\\", perhaps a mite overlong, but extremely touching, kind and suggestive.

Clocking in at a ballsy 45 minutes, the album takes you--whether you're ready for the ride or not--on a journey of unprecedented scale. Prince holds no punches musically or lyrically on this tour de France of an album. Head bashing riffs, toe tapp'n beats, and tear jerking melodies collide here in a musical harmonic convergence.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|I was so glad to see this on DVD, because I have worn out my VHS copy.  This is a chick flick, and one of the best adaptations of Jane Austin's novel.  Enjoy!
6305907145|5.0|For those of you who absolutely loved Mansfield Park, the book, and are hopeless Jane Austen purists this movie will probably disappoint you. If on the other hand, you are like me and are a devoted fan of Jane Austen and a purist about everything else Jane Austen, yet for some reason you didn't especially love Mansfield Park, then you will enjoy this movie. The main characters, Fanny, Edmund, Henry, and Mariah, are extremely well cast  and are very good actors and actresses. Fanny's character is a fair bit more decided and strong than in the book, but I was always inclined to think her a little lacking in spine. It follows the main storyline fairly well, only getting a few things at the end rearranged.One thing that they brought into this movie which I wasn't sure belonged in a Jane Austen movie was a sort of abolitionist view point on Edmund, Fanny and Tom's part. Though it was very true that the Bertram's lived off of the slave's labor in in Antigua this aspect of the movie didn't really make it feel period to me, it felt more like it was set in the 1800's.   So, If you were like me and thought that the book drug on for ever and wrapped up in the last chapter,then you will probably enjoy this movie.
B0000029DD|5.0|Not sure why I'd not heard about this album until last week. Thank goodness for Amazon's recommendation!    What a gift this young man left us so shortly before his tragic death! That voice, oh his voice!! This is timeless, beautiful, lush album...    I would have wanted to know before I purchased this album that I would become addicted. Hallelujah is so raw, you can feel it in your bones. Corpus Christ Carol... the vocal range, the vocal control is almost unearthly. Then going into Eternal Life, you cannot believe it's still him, his ability to move his voice around a song is uncanny.    This is a treasure of music, lyrics, melodies, and that hauntingly beautiful voice.
0887431453|5.0|My son just turned three in August, but he has already completed this book.  We did a few pages everyday - I think we spent a couple of months on it.  He is now able to write upper and lowercase letters, and can do simple math concepts, such as greater vs. lesser, which group has more...there are mazes, coloring activities, and a variety of lessons to teach shapes, sizes, counting, writing, etc.<br /><br />What I liked best about this book is the different phrases that they use in the instructions.  My son learned the relationship between phrases \\"which ones match\\" and \\"where does it belong\\", \\"which one is different\\" and \\"which one is not the same\\"...just to name a couple.  My son immediately applied what he learned from the book to his everyday activities, so I know that he did absorb some, if not all, the lessons.<br /><br />Since this book is a combination of smaller books from School Zone, it's not necessary to buy the others unless your child has trouble with a particular area.  My son struggled with the pages dealing with \\"beginning sounds,\\" so I bought him the book that is just activities to teach beginning sounds.<br /><br />I prefer School Zone to all other preschool workbook series, with the exception of Kumon.
0375826726|2.0|I thought that Eragon was a very good start (even better after seeing all that the movie left out) and that Eldest was excellent, but I am not sure what happened here.  Perhaps I am to blame for expecting too much.    My biggest problems with this story is that there seems to be no growth in Eragon - I do not see how he is any better off at the end of this book than before.  I thought many characters acted out of character, including one leading to his/her demise.    One other question I have to ask - why has there not been any mention of Saphira and Glaedr breeding?  Needs to be addressed.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|After reading David McCollough's truly inspiring John Adams, I was eagerly awaiting the HBO Mini-series. I was hugely disappointed.  It seems HBO was hell bent on an agenda to almost totally distort the image of this passionate patriot. Several episodes in the book were particularly inspiring, as they offered a measure of John Adam's  dedication to our fledgling country. One was his determination to travel with his company a thousand miles by mule to Paris after the Sensible could not make it to its intended port and needed to let the John Adam's party off the coast of Spain. In the miniseries, John Adams and John Quincy just appear in Paris. Another episode involved negotiations with the British over the details of Independence. These negotiations included defining the boundaries of United States territory, navigation rights on the Mississippi, debts, fishing rights off Newfoundland and compensation to the loyalists. Adams insisted on America's position on all these issues and won. Most impressive was John Adam's absolute insistence that the British recognize the United States before any negotiations could take place. He stood strong on this point, in spite of the Continental Congress's direction to avoid this issue. These were truly inspiring episodes which  would be the stuff of imaginative genius, but they are especially glorious because they are the actual accomplishments of this truly great man. For reasons that make no sense, HBO completely disregarded them both.    HBO's depiction of John Adams as a person was of one not recognized in the book. John Adams was clearly the fire and passion behind Independence, a truly great patriot, a loving husband and father and a faithful friend. HBO's John Adams comes off as a humorless, peevish, arrogant toad, guided to any positive accomplishment only buy the hand of his wife. In fact HBO's Abigail is so prominent in the miniseries, she at times seems to hold the central role. I grew increasingly weary of Abigail being continually lionized in contrast to the HBO's deeply flawed version of our second president.  Shame on HBO!    A great man - a great book - a disastrous miniseries.
B000002UAF|5.0|I have listened to every Beatles album over and over and over again.  I have had times where each of the albums have been my favorite and where each album I have been sick of.  I have endlessly played and replayed passages from nearly all the songs to grok on what makes them tick.<br /><br />After such a thorough \\"wringing out\\" of each album, it is my opinion that a Hard Day's Night is the greatest Beatle album in that it had the greatest intensity of creativity in the shortest time span.  It was an awesome roman candle of musical output. Any of the songs on this album could've been a crown jewel for any band or artist; any of these tunes had the potential to be the one hit that could make their career, if properly arranged and promoted.<br /><br />With Hard Day's Night, in an amazingly short time span, the Lennon and McCartney wrote an entire album of crown jewels.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />What was even more mind-blowing was that this wasn't their first album.<br /><br />Lots of groups come off gangbusters on their first album, because they've had a long time to incubate the songs.  A Hard Day's Night was the Beatles' third album, the one after the long-accumulated initial musical cream was skimmed off.  This was the \\"Omigod!\\" album, the album that bespoke of a veritable North Sea oilfield of yet-untapped talent.<br /><br />(Note: U.S. version of this album was watered down, with some of the best cuts being shunted off to other albums.  As superb as the US edition was, the UK edition is much better.)
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I have a rule for buying CDS: I have to like at least four of the songs to make it worth my while...I took a chance and bought this after hearing only two of the songs played on the radio, but it turns out that I like almost every song.<br /><br />There are a couple where she sings with a very high yet soft voice that I thought was kind of boring, but I enjoyed her vocals the rest of the time.  Her style reminds me of the Go-Gos [[ASIN:B000001I0O Beauty and the Beat]], and Thompson Twins.  (Yeah, I am an an 80s fan).<br /><br />The lyrics are hysterical; she's very good at telling stories, and even though you might be tempted to think she is exagerating, I could relate to a lot of the scenarios she describes.<br /><br />I love ALL KINDS of music - I have very eclectic tastes, but I have to say it was refreshing to hear a female vocalist who didn't create another hip-hop album or a whiny alternative album (you know, the ones where every single song is directed to some guy).
0375826726|5.0|Paolini did not dissappoint.  Even though some of the storyline was predictable from the previous books, I was very happy with how he developed the plot, and I found myself having the appropriate emotions even when reading something I knew was going to happen.  He deviated from predictability on certain topics (such as the the 'weapon' under the Manoa Tree and the significance of the word Brisingr), resolved some issues and ended the book in a manner that left me very satified and itching for the last book to come quickly.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This CD is a mosaic which combines the genus of David Downes, the talent of six fantastic artists, the richness of Celtic and contemporary music, along with a marvelous orchestra and chorus.  Each artist can be heard performing individually as well as together in adaptations of tradition folk music such as  \\"Dulaman\\", \\"Scarborough Fair\\", and\\" Spanish Lady\\", adult contemporary which include \\"Beyond the Sea\\", the classical pieces of \\"Lascua Ch'io Pianga, and newer composition in the Celtic style which include \\"The Sky and the Dawn and the Sun\\", \\"At the Ceili, and \\"Caledonia.  Maireasd's solo performances in\\"Grasssnuaile's Dance\\", and \\"Shenandoah-The Pacific Shore\\" are just as enjoyable as seeing her perform.  Listing to her on the CD provides an appreciation of her great talent as a violinist.  The music touches the spirit and takes the individual on a journey beyond the senses.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an awesome workout. I was recently on a message board and people were saying good things about it so I thought I would give it a try. Yesterday was my first day and it was very challenging. The great thing is that she has two girls behind her for the beginners and the more advanced. I defineitly feel like I'm getting a better workout than running on the treadmill for 20+ minutes.
1596434252|2.0|This is a pop-up book that goes through all 26 letters of the English alphabet.<br /><br />The front cover has a 4-level lenticular sticker that shows the letters A, B, C, or D depending on how you tilt the book.  Unfortunately, you never really see one clearly though regardless of how the book is held.  You mostly see a mixture of two or three of the levels that simply hurts your eyes to look at.<br /><br />The inside \\"pop-up\\" letters are boring and uninspiring.  I am not sure I would want to use this as a teaching tool for younger children either.  Some of the letters really don't resemble the correct letters at all.  'K' for example looks more like half of a bow-tie.<br /><br />'U' is probably the most interesting of the pop-ups.  It consists of dozens of complex cuts and folds of a solid piece of cardboard that unfolds as you open the pages.  Too bad I would not know that it was the letter 'U' unless I cheated and peaked at the letter 'T' before it.<br /><br />There is no text other than the letters themselves through the book.  There are only three colors used: white, black, and red.  Boring.<br /><br />The quality of the book is reasonable however, and it should hold up under careful use.  All pop-up books are somewhat fragile, but this book shipped with plenty of paper inserts to protect the complicated folds and designs within.  A few pages required the reader to carefully close the page making sure everything was folding back into place.  A quick careless flip through this book would probably damge it, but then again all pop-up books are like this.<br /><br />But children that are young enough to only want to look at the alphabet are probably not going to be careful enough to prevent damage.  And older children will probably be bored by the letter 'D'.  This product is probably best for adult use while demonstrating the letters to a younger child.  Then again, a lot of these letters don't resemble the real letters so this limits it's use as a teaching tool. I'd probably advise to avoid this product regardless.ardless.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Excellent product. In this album Metallica shows us why they are the world's greatest heavy metal band. Absolutely magnificent. And the cd box is really cool, I really like those digipack boxes. If you enjoy Metallica's early years, sure thing you will like this cd.
0061537934|5.0|The book really hit home on the thought process and feelings that a dog may have. A heart warming story about a man, his dog and his family. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Marley and Me is also very good!.
1433502410|5.0|I just recieved my pre-order copies yesterday and am already devouring it.  The detail and richness of notes is exceptional.  Unlike other Study Bibles its depth is incredible, including whole articles regarding ethics, theology, and on and on.    What I enjoy most of all is the non-dogmatic nature of the notes.  This is the most non-denominational study bible I've ever seen.  It presents the reader with multiple points of view and allows you to decide for yourself based on the Word, rather than simply stating matter-of-factly \\"this is what it means\\".  The end result is that you spend more time in engaged thinking and less time in confused questioning.  A good example is Revelations, if you have a Scofield Study Bible you get the dispensational point of view... I grew up not knowing there were other points of view.    The ESV is a wonderful translation and the Study Bible combines a whole research library into a single (massive) volume.    I have both the hardbound and leatherbound edition, both are beautiful with high grade paper.  I expected the hardbound edition to have inferior paper quality, but was surprised that it does not.      This is an excellent tool, and given the quantity and quality of the content, its an exceptional value.  The best buy might be to buy the hardbound copy with a bible cover that has handles... this thing is heavy!
0446579939|5.0|I found The Lucky One, by Nicholas Sparks, captivating. Nicholas Sparks is a #1 New York Times best-selling author with over fifty million copies of his books in print worldwide and translated into over forty languages. Other titles include: The Rescue, A Bend in the Road, The Guardian, The Wedding, True Believer, At First Sight, Dear John, The Choice, and Three Weeks With My Brother. Nicholas Sparks has also had four of his novels adapted into major motion pictures including: Message in a Bottle, The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe. Nicholas Sparks resides in North Carolina with his wife and family.  While in his third tour of duty in Iraq, U.S. Marine Logan Thibault happens upon a half-buried photograph of a beautiful young woman, simply known as E. After no one has claimed it, Logan finds himself drawn to it and carrying it in his pocket wherever he goes. More importantly, he discovers it brings him luck. His friend, Victor, seems to think it was his fate to find it and calls it his lucky charm. Once he is back home in Colorado, Logan can't seem to get the woman out of his mind. Understanding just how crazy it was, he sets forth on foot from Colorado to North Carolina in search of what very well may be his destiny. He didn't have any illusions of what might await him, but he sure wasn't expecting the instant attraction to Elizabeth, the sincere fondness for her Nana, the friction with her ex, Clayton, or  to fall immediately in love with her ten-year-old son, Ben. Pursuing the path he chose and attraction for Beth, they ignite a passionate affair of the heart, never knowing that the secret of how he came about the photo could destroy everything he had waited his entire life to find.  True to form, and with a power-house ending, it's no secret why Nicholas Sparks has captivated readers worldwide for some time now. How rare it is to find a man who can craft a story in this genre with so much insight in the human condition, affairs of the heart,the importance of family- and to do it in a manner that always seems new and unique. I find that to be the best part of this author, that when he has you crying, laughing, or ready to spit nails, he has the power to make you believe that anything is possible- that fate and destiny are not myths, after all. (Insert sigh here), Another great read from a true gem in this genre.  The Lucky One, by Nicholas Sparks, is an engaging, charming, and witty tale, determined to restore your faith in happily ever after again.    Kelly Moran  Author and Reviewer
B000929AJQ|3.0|...it's a very common trend for bands to state that their style has changed or that they proclaim this is \\"More different but still the same thing\\"...some people think it's a sign of maturity of a band while others think it's simply a band selling out...in this case it's not as simple as that...    ...Pretty Hate Machine was an album that helped break the boundaries of pop and industrial and was still a very solid album of critical acclaim...the Downward Spiral brought it a step forward with dark if a tad childish concepts and intense and dark beats and samples...the Fragile unfortunately I had to skip during this experiment due to the fact that there's no way I'm reviewing every track in a double album...    ...With Teeth however is not exactly different it's just...much more bland...the same concept that they had with their debut is still there...it's just less hypnotic...less interesting...and almost completely emotionless due to polished production and the lack of intensity...I'll go through every track...    All the Love in the World 7/10: A drum machine with Trent singing...his falsetto is very cringe worthy because I can hear his voice cracking if I listen hard enough and it doesn't feel pure nor wanted...this track actually reminds me of the album Kid A by Radiohead...I'm unsure who came first but I have more respect for Radiohead...but after I found the Kid A similarities it was hard to take seriously...think of the song \\"Everything in its right place\\" with some slightly more groovy bass lines and overuse of drum machines...oh how I miss Thom Yorke's awkward falsetto...I can't listen to this song without thinking of Radiohead now...and whenever I think of another band when I'm listening to a song...it just loses its credibility...    You Know What You Are 7/10: Fast \\"real\\" drums combined with some weird synthy sounds...nothing new and then Trent starts talking rather falsely manically...the structure is all their at this point...it explodes into a synthed bass line in the chorus...but this has all been heard from Trent before and more interesting...also echoing the \\"S\\" word Trent doesn't really increase shock value...at all...do you know what you are Trent? It modulates key after the second chorus which is nice and goes into a nice synthy interlude which seems to be more enjoyable...I fear Trent's amazing vocals are starting to become a weak point...besides that the layered patterns of this song aren't any different...just plopping in a random piano and guitar every now and then...    The Collector 7/10: This one is an odd one...at times it sounds like it's going somewhere...the bass line is good but I wish it was further at the front of the mix in front of Trent's vocals like on \\"Mr Self Destruct\\"...because Trent and the guitar just completely dominate the sound of the bass...drums are real this time and really uninspiring...come on Trent...use your magical drum machine again...Trent's vocals are uninspiring this time round...what's happening Trent? Is this sober Trent? Oh dear oh dear...the piano solo however is a delight...it adds a sinister neo-classicism air to it...but the thing is...throughout this album Trent does overkill the use of random piano...    The Hand That Feeds 5/10: I simply can't dislike this song enough...such a ridiculously simple bass line...repetitive real drum track...guitars added pointless chords and uninspired lyrics the structure follows basic ABABCB structure...if you like those annoying bands that all sound like each other only with a synthesiser solo near the end then you might like this song...I however know that Trent can do much MUCH better than this song...what's more all the stuff about staying on your knees...I'm sure that this was a topic in \\"Head Like a Hole\\"...why again Trent? WHY!!?    Love Is not Enough 7/10: Another real drum track...along with some real bass entering...it starts off pretty good...Trent's new talky vocals aren't entirely awful...the chorus kind of kills thebuzz however with it's annoying poppy and simple happiness...it just sounds too happy in contrast with the verse...shame shame...I've got nothing against happiness it's just in this track it doesn't add up...it gets an extra mark however because at least they tried some experimentation with synthesised voices...it makes a change...on this album of mediocrity...    Every day is exactly the same 7/10: Again this starts well and the bass has a very good melodic ostinato...the synthesisers don't really add much to it though otherwise for the sake of just being there...yet again...the chorus blows it for me...it's not as bad as the previous song but it's just such a predictable key change and I could have predicted that change due to the bass's melodic pattern...and the fact that Trent...who would be at this point a well known Celebrity...is complaining that every day is exactly the same...I can't accept that he can empathise with the basic civilian with all that money...not to say that it's impossible for him to do so...but he needs to be honest with himself and his audience...I could be annoying and say every song is exactly the same as a pun...but it wouldn't work and would sound stupid...    With Teeth 6/10: The title track...the rotting yellow teeth of this nurse shark of an album...starting with a simple build up of bass and guitar and drums as usual...the samples seem to be very lacking in this album...it's just the primary instruments...and it's annoying...Trent is singing about a relationship of some kind...to be honest it's pretty boring for a title track...just explodes very lightly in the chorus (barely increasing by a decibel) and then carries on...maybe the tooth fairy will come and yank this track out...haha...look how annoyingly clever I'm trying to be...it then has an annoying whisper near the middle and the piano just quietly plays to itself failing to sound sinister and then really predictably comes back to what it was playing before...thank you for being so obvious Trent...    Only 7/10: This song isn't as awful as people say...it is by no means brilliant...but in contrast to the other stuff on this album I can pick this out as the latter that is slightly above the other stuff...Trent talks about something and the bass goes on and on and on and on in the same thing...Trent goes on and on and on and on and on and on...the drums go on and on and on and...*yawn*...on...the synths are in there to liven things up but they just don't do enough special things to rise it above to the holier-than-thou NIN state that the fans loved...the intro to the track is then repeated which is the part I liked of the song due to the piano's addition being a very nice eerie melody...but Trent kills it...completely...and it's upsetting me...    Getting Smaller 5/10: Starts with some simple guitar noodling but of course the drums have to come in so that means they have to play something \\"proper\\" and all the magic goes...Trent says \\"FLOP FLOP FLOP FLOP!!!\\" And it just makes me think...yes Trent...yes...they try and go into this mainstream alt-rock guitar riff in the chorus and it just puts me off and irritates me...this is not the same band I heard with the Downward Spiral...I am so so so so irritated now...even Slipknot during this experiment did better than this...    Sunspots 7/10: Starts with a nice plodding sinister bass line...Trent singing quietly and dissonantly...it reminds me slightly of the first album...and it starts off very well...Trent sings falsetto and they return back to this album's sensibilities...the verses are great...nice and evil...yet again these mainstream \\"We're trying to make an alternative anthem\\" just ruins it completely...the synths actually do something slightly more different but if you've heard the other albums you'll know it's nothing new nor interesting...    The Line Begins to Blur 8/10: Starts very well...electronically altered bass and drum stop that sounds very mechanical...Trent's voice is shovedin the background but that doesn't stop it sounding very very mainstream and annoying...I never thought I'd want Trent to shut up...but I do now...the chorus is rather bearable this time though...the evil piano and droning synths help create a nice and dark atmosphere with the electronic stop of the bass contrasting with it very well...but that's all there is to it...and that's all there can be to it with only 3 minute tracks...    Beside you in time 6/10: Starting by taking the end note of the previous track and making a rhythm out of it...other melodic synths are added and Trent sings like he's depressed about something or other...and on...and on...and on...and on...and on...they just take the drone and add slightly more layers to it with Trent saying...and on...and on...and on...he pretty much sums up the track for me...it just goes on and on in a mainstream manner...it layers with more higher melodic instruments later on it the track but it doesn't change anything...it's still a bland track that has no value of interest...take a lesson from Sunn O))) if you want to know how to make good drones...    Right Where It Belongs 7/10: So how's the grand finale of this disappointing album? As we start with simple synthed notes...Trent sings about an animal in its cage...and then I think to myself \\"Is he trying to make a new hurt? NO TRENT!! DON'T DO IT!!! IT'S NOT POSSIBLE!!!\\" So I listened in the hop that it would turn into some crazy industrial beat so he could save the credibility of hurt...but then I heard the key changes and as it carried on I just thought \\"He's really going to do it...oh dear\\"...and then the track ended...it's not an awful song...just emotionless...he sang well...but with no empathy or any kind of concept that I could believe...    ...my advice? Skip this album unless you heard \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and want to buy an album filled with songs like that...if that's the case you won't be disappointed...if you're into old Nine Inch Nails...you mightlike it but if you're anything like me (but why would you want to be?) you'll see this as a social decline and not worth your time pondering over...    ...now I move on to Year Zero...this album is meant to apparently be an impressive come back...I hope it is because I don't think I can take another With Teeth...
031606792X|5.0|Short and sweet.    I loved it. Sure it is far fetched and completely unrealistic, but that's why it is called FICTION. It's not real-it's a story.
0446579939|5.0|I haven't read all of Nicholas Spark's novels but this has to be one of the better ones!!  I read it on a peaceful afternoon with the autumn leaves (I hate to say it) drifting by the window.  The book fit right in.<br /><br />The idea of a photograph affecting so many lives has been long in coming.  I don't remember another story like it.<br /><br />Logan is a survivor of 3 tours in Iraq who feels that this photo that he found there brought him through.  He is obsessed with the picture of the girl standing by the ferris wheel and sets out to find her.<br /><br />Elizabeth is a teacher with a young son and an aging grandmother who runs a kennel.  Keith is her ex-husband who has managed so far to discourage anyone who seems interested in his ex-wife. Ben is their son who is too gentle to measure up to his father's expectations.<br /><br />And then Logan finds them and the story really begins!  It's gentle and absorbing and makes you glad you read it.<br /><br />And my favorite hero?!  Zeus, Logan's dog.  I absolutely loved him!<br /><br />This book is a really good read.  I wonder who will be in the movie.
B00004RF8J|3.0|Well, I can't quite place this on the same level as \\"Tommy\\" or \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show.\\" But that said, this is a pretty good musical. (And not totally out of place for Halloween.)<br /><br />The story (surrounded by impressive music of course) is basically this. Moranis works at a flower shop that is close to dying from lack of business. Just when things look hopeless, Moranis pulls out a 'strange and interesting' plant he bought from a street merchant. As if it were magic, people start coming in off the streets, and the store gets more business than they would have ever expected.<br /><br />Moving on, we see that Moranis has his eyes on Audrey (Ellen Greene), but she is already dating someone. That someone happens to be a less than kind dentist. He abuses her both physically and psychologically. Moranis starts to gain some popularity because of his plant, but he is more preoccupied with Auderey. Suddenly, he realizes his plant can speak, sing, and perhaps perform some favors. (Perhaps he can get Moranis Greene and give him success and riches.) But there is of course a price. Moranis will have to keep killing people, to get blood, to keep the plant alive.<br /><br />Moranis is of course reluctant, but he has little trouble deciding to make Audrey's abusive boyfriend the plant's first meal. For a moment, all looks like it could be well. Moranis and Audrey might end up together; Moranis is all of a sudden successful; and things are happy. But this is not to last.<br /><br />Moranis realizes that one murder is often only the start of a bigger game. To make a long story short, Moranis ends up killing the Vincent Gardenia character. (A flaw in the story is that Audrey seems totally oblivious to Vincent Gardenia's disappearance.) From here, Moranis's success is more scary than anything. (Director Frank Oz said he wanted to make it look like Moranis had made a deal with the devil.)<br /><br />At this point, Moranis starts to realize that success is not worth the price he has to pay. (Moranis's character and Arthur Miller may have had a nice chat.) The plant tries to kill and eat Audrey, but Moranis rises to the occasion. This leads to a climactic (but still comical) showdown between the plant and Moranis.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice picture with great music, memorable characters, and a good mixture of horror, and hilarious comedycter and Arthur Miller may have had a nice chat.)

1433502410|5.0|This Bible is full. Chock full of many different experts on biblical scholarship, maps, notes, graphic design, and durability. What you need to realize is exactly what the authors mentioned in their preface:    \\"The ESV Study Bible contains two kinds of words. The first kind is the actual words of the Bible, which are the very words of God to us. These are printed in the larger font at the top of each page. The second kind is the study notes, which are merely human words. These are printed in the smaller font at the bottom of each page. The difference in font sizes serves to remind readers that the words of the Bible itself are infinitely more valuable than the words of the notes.\\"    These scholars, Bible teachers, and publishers know they are under God. And what you probably know, is that study Bibles are meant to be tools. Thus, I just come at you saying this: read the notes and learn and absorb them, but meditate on God's word that you may be refreshed, and use the Word as a sword like you're instructed. Take these notes for what they are worth. So far I've learned a bit and certainly enjoyed the commentary, but God's word is so much more valuable and powerful.    Blessings.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|The title of my review should summarize why I enjoyed this movie that much. I actually did not have the chance to watch this in theaters and I can't say I regret it. I remember watching the Speed Racer cartoons when I was a kid, while I was not a big fan I remember it as a childhood memory as well as the smurfs, transformers, and the like.<br /><br />The Movie<br /><br />I will not get into many details reviewing the movie as there are already too many reviews in here for that. Yes, it is a movie with a very simple story and as far as I remember the movie does not deviate that much from the source material. Watching this film is like watching the cartoon come to life, the shots of the Speed talking to Trixie and Racer X in the middle of a race, Speed jumping out of his car after winning a race and striking his pose, the annoying kid with the chimp, all that made it to the movie. So I may call it nostalgia but while the story was too simple I found myself enjoying the film a lot.<br /><br />The picture quality is unbelievable. I watched this on a 50\\" HDTV and it looked incredible, from the childhood sequences with Speed meeting Trixie to the Casa Cristo race, the colors look vibrant and the image looks impeccable. The Wachowski brothers have done it again, the technical achievements of this film make it a great movie to watch and definitely a must if you want to show off your HD home theater system. The audio however could have been better, it sounds ok, but I have other bluray movies that do sound better as they use the audio capabilities bluray has to offer.<br /><br />The Extras<br /><br />The movie has some documentaries on the making of the film and the \\"extreme\\" racing style they created for the movie. These are presented in a 4:3 presentation and not HD.<br /><br />The bluray presentation has 2 additional discs, a DVD game and a digital copy of the film. While the digital copy is appreciated as I can carry the movie in my Ipod, it isn't really an added value to me (while it might be for someone else)<br /><br />Now the DVD game is not something you can install in your computer, it is actually a DVD that needs to be played in a regular DVD player. Using the racing sequences from the film you can choose to play as one of the characters of the film (this will determine the car and sequence you will play) and then you \\"drive\\" using the arrows in the remote... does it sound bad and boring? It is worst than it sounds.<br /><br />I have seen lately many releases have the +digital copy as a standard extra, I personally would be more interested in extras concerning the movie and how it was made than a boring DVD videogame and a digital copy of the movie, but that's just me. I don't think I'll use again the two additional discs included with the movie.the DVD game is not something you can install in your computer, it is actually a DVD that needs to be played in a regular DVD player.

B001CIPU3G|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD. \\"The Crusade\\" was a great CD, but it doesn't have as many stand out songs as this one does. I can basically listen to this whole album without skipping tracks, (except for the last song, that's the only one I don't really like.) But the first song, \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" has one of the best riffs I've ever heard. The whole song is great though. \\"Down From The Sky\\" which has a Metallica's One-esque video, is also one of my favorite songs. Everything about this album is really good and they've progressed alot from Ascendancy & The Crusade. This easily one of my favorite Heavy Metal CD's.     -Favorite Songs In order-  1.) Kirisute Gomen  2.) Down From The Sky  3.) Of Prometheus And The Crucifix  4.) Insurrection  5.) He Who Spanwed The Furies  6.) Into The Mouth Of Hell We March  7.) Torn Between Scylla And Charybdis   8.) Like A Callisto To A Star In Heaven  9.) The Calamity  10.) Throes of Perdition  11.) Shogun
B0013ND30M|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is a musical collage of music and lyrics animated for all to see. The Disney classic is one to collect and enjoy. I am very pleased with the way Disney recaptured the original, and how almost everything in the film looked as if it was just created for the first time. The picture is amazing, and the enhanced audio is a extremely nice touch.The special features are ROCKING, especially for any young kids, you young at heart! I think they did well with this, and it makes for a nice add on to your Disney movie collection. I think for the price Amazon offers it doesn't make for an expensive re-buy either, if you go to any other store, the price is above $18, and I payed under that with shipping. I am not completely happy with how Disney re-invents it's already pre-released classics and films, but for what they add on, how they make the picture better and better, and everything else they end up adding on or offering, it is worth it. A short and dreamy classic that really adds to the value of a well restored viewing of an old classic.
B000GPIPSS|4.0|Tod Browning did more than perhaps any other filmmaker to develop the \\"horror\\" genre, and this Gothic horror masterpiece is one of the crown jewels in his filmography.     Perhaps the first genuinely \\"supernatural\\" American horror films (previous American horror films always explained away the existence of spirits or demons by attributing the scary goings-on to escaped mental patients or psychotics). Universal was perhaps the perfect studio to produce this film, as the large influx of German talent in the late 20s had created a house style at the studio perfectly suited to such a film. The atmospheric, Expressionist cinematography by Karl Freund is one of the most memorable aspects of the film. Browning's direction is solid, although he is still clearly uncomfortable with the requirements of making a sound film (his best work had been in silents, and his most memorable sound films were those in which he was able to direct non-talking sequences). Still, Browning's distinct touch is evident throughout the film, creating a much more genuinely terrifying, menacing sense of horror than the slightly more sympathetic and even at times campy horror found in the work of James Whale.    As with many talkies made between 1930 and 1932, there is very little underscoring throughout the film (\\"Swan Lake\\" is used memorably under the opening titles). While some consider this a deficiency of the film, it's important to remember that Browning dictated the lack of music to heighten the atmospheric sound. There is a version with a score composed by Philip Glass, running under most of the non-talking scenes, which lacks the taste that one usually associates with that composer.    \\"Dracula\\" stands as a seminal film in the development of the horror genre, of great interests to genre fans and film historians alike.
1400095204|5.0|This book is great.  If I wasn't so anti-violence and war I could have easily finished this book in a day.  A great read for all Nigerians, especially young Igbos.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Sequels aren't always the best, but since Batman Begins was one of the best movies I've ever seen, I held out great hope that they'd do a good job with The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger was epic and again Christian Bale's performance was stunning. All cast members, especially Gary Oldman, were equally as epic. Great flick. I predict it will be remembered at Oscar time and I hope for more than just Heath Ledger's performance, he should win that Oscar.
0802136834|5.0|Excellent account of the times.  Makes you appreciate the often precarious positions these vulnerable and ambitious women were in!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Although I found the ending somewhat disappointing, I really found this to actually be a great addition to the Indy franchise.  Why do I say this?  Because it is filled with the rollicking, high-flying adventure that made Indiana Jones so lovable in the first place.  Also, I cannot believe how many people complained that Harrison Ford was just too old to play Indy anymore.  I don't know what other movie they were watching, but I saw a Harrison Ford playing the part of Indy very well with still a tremendous amount of youth in his blood.  Also, I really felt that Cate Blanchett did a SPECTACULAR job playing the part of Irina Spalko and felt she \\"sunk her teeth into those doublevus\\" just fine with the Russian accent.  I know that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I really found much of the criticism hurled at this film really unjustified. The one aspect, however, that I am inclined to agree with the negative reviewers on is with the ending.  I really felt that Spielberg and Lucas could have come up with a much more powerful ending, such as what we saw in \\"Raiders\\" or \\"Crusade\\", and instead set the audience up for a rather anti-climatic finish.  This was about my only complaint about the film and, despite this, I still found it enjoyable and definitely worth a viewing.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|DVD was brand new in factory sealed wrap.  Plays great and my daughter loves the movie!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. is a very talented actor and even though this was just a fun fluff piece for him to act, he did it with such finesse that it was a work of art.
B0000042MY|4.0|This is an excellent soundtrack and makes for great (and relaxing) listening in the car.
B00007GZRA|4.0|It was fun reviewing the early SG-1. The series was on for 10 seasons so it had been a while since I saw these episodes. Very glad I ordered the DVD so now I can watch whenever I want to.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|The first half hour of Speed Racer was excruciating to watch.  I was ready to eject it and throw it across the room.  But as the film transcends it slowly puts you in a trance and you begin to aclimate to the bright colours and spazy visuals.  Alot of the film is bizarre.  I will definately say it is a unique style of filmaking,  but I sure hope this is not the future of movies.  I only need one movie like this, Speed Racer is in a class of it's own.  The Wachowski Brothers did a borderline good job with this, but there are a few flaws here and there.  By the second half of the movie Speed Racer thankfully gains it's momentum and keeps it going.  Some of the acting was borderline as well.  Spirtle added a surreal and borderline annoying element to the film.  He  adds to the campiness, giving it that b-movie feel.  You don't know whether to hug him or bash his face in. OKAY WARNING. THIS IS WHERE MY REVIEW TAKES A DETOUR.  The main reason I liked Speed Racer is because of Emile Hirsch. there is something about him.  I loved him in Into the Wild and in Speed Racer he is his usual beyond hot self.  You just want to pause the movie on his face and go up and kiss the screen.  There were a couple parts where he looked really cute and I hit pause and just stared at his face for a couple minutes.  Is that weird?  He really turned this movie out with his intense acting.  I hate saying this but it almost seemed as though he was miscast.  His character and persona are a bit deep for this kind of movie but for me, it worked to his advantage.  At this point I would watch anything he stars in.  he could read the phone book for all I care and I would sit there and watch every minute.  He's got to be the #1 actor.  From beginning to end this is a decent movie so Emile Hirsch is 2 for 2.  I hope he stars in another good movie.

B000KQGOA4|5.0|How can you say anything negative about Host The Planets.  But, as a music layman, when it came to \\"Neptune\\", I always pressed the skip button on my remote.  To me, it is just 7 minutes of a wind chime in the distance.  What were you thinking, Gustov?  Having heard other versions of the \\"Planets\\", I think this is truly one of, if not, the best version.  The sound quality is also excellent.  I was even tempted to let \\"Neptune\\" play all the way through.
6304698690|1.0|Originally, I had high hopes for this movie version of the beloved Frances Hodgson Burnett classic.<br />Directed by Agnieska Holland, who directed the award winning \\"Europa, Europa,\\" screenplay by Caroline Thompson, whose credits include \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", musical score composed by Zbigniew Preisner, with performances by John Lynch, Kate Maberly and the legendary, Dame Maggie Smith this movie had all of the makings of a film classic. However, my hopes were dashed to pieces, like a fine crystal vase thrown against a wall. The main fault of the film is the screenplay, authored by Caroline Thompson. Instead of following Burnett's classic storyline, it appears the author chose to give her own interpretation of the hidden meaning of the garden and those it influences. The mood of the movie has a dark, ominous tone, with the focus fixated on the mysticism and healing power of the garden. Incidentally, this movie was filmed in the early 1990's when the \\"New Age\\" movement was gaining momentum and becoming fashionable in the West. Hence, elements of New Age theology are woven throughout the film, which diverts from Hodgson's original intent of exploring healing through Mary Baker Eddy's Christian Science theories. I will credit Agnieska Holland with brilliant direction, Zbigniew Preisner with a memorable musical score and Roger Deakins and Jerzy Zielinksi with amazing cinematography.<br />In lieu of this movie version, I recommend the Hallmark Hall of Fame version. The Hallmark Hall of Fame movie was filmed on location in Yorkshire at Highclere Castle, the present location for Julian Fellowes hit \\"Downtown Abbey.\\" Directed by Alan Grint, BBC's \\"Coronation Street\\", screenplay by the legendary  Blanche Hanalis, \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" and \\"Young Pioneers\\", musical score by John Cameron \\"A Touch of Class\\" and with performances by Derek Jacobi, Colin Firth, Gennie James and Michael Hordern this version brings the beloved classic to life.
B001BKXUOQ|3.0|This album is too heavy and there is hardly any rythym. The only good songs are Psychosocial, Dead Memories, and Sulfur. Other than that it kinda sucks!
B0017I1FP8|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible, one of the best I`ve ever heard.  Moving pieces like \\"Harvey Two-Face\\", \\"Like A Dog Chasing Cars\\", \\"Introduce A Little Anarchy\\" and \\"A Dark Knight\\" are among my favorites in this soundtrack.  The journey it takes you from heroic, action tunes such as the track \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\" to dark, creepy and disturbing pieces like  \\"Why So Serious?\\" and \\"Watch The World Burn.\\"  Overall, this soundtrack has the right mix of everything, action, creepy and moody pieces, and heroic and tragic pieces.  This soundtrack also has several pieces that have simple, yet beautiful piano pieces in tracks like \\"Harvey Two-Face\\" and \\"Agent of Chaos\\"  In conclusion I loved this soundtrack overall and I am an avid musician, loving everything from hard rock to instrumental.

0375826726|4.0|This is a very good continuation of the story of eragon. As you read the series you see the author maturing in his craft just as the main character does, making each book better than the last. Don't buy it till you have time to read it, though, because once you start reading you will not put it down until It's finished!
1582701709|5.0|This should be a secret ninja scroll and how to manifest your thoughts into reality. Definitely some Ninja Magic but it works. I believe it goes beyond what many people call positive thinking. In Japan there is a force call Ki or the life force. This something science can not explain or measure. I believe this Ki is connected universally to all beings, and throught time and space. The greatest thing I take away from this book, is that as you think you have something it is already yours. As past, present, and future are one. I am a Ninjutsu practioner and this is one teaching founding in the ninja arts.
0375826726|5.0|I loved this book so much I read it in like 3 days.  It's the third by Chris and I know that he is super cool.  He's my writing hero.  The book is for pretty much anyone with the time and patience to read it.  If you haven't read all three books I definitely recommend reading them.

0786838655|5.0|I loved \\"The Lightning Thief\\" by Rick Riordan very much.  It is about a boy named Percy. Percy is a normal kid who struggles in school. He has learning disabilities and ADHD just like me.      Percy is in a boarding school in New York.  The class goes on a field trip to the museum.  His math teacher tries to kill him.  Percy finds a pen that turns into a sword.  When Percy used the sword, the teacher vaporized into dust.  It is then that Percy realized he is different from other kids.       After that, Percy goes home to see his mother and brother. Percy's real father left him when he was a little boy.  On a family vacation, Percy and his mother are chased by a minotaur.  Percy thinks his mother is dead and runs toward a tree.  The tree leads him to half-blood hill.  Soon he is at a camp for half-bloods.  Half-bloods are children that have one human parent and one Greek god parent.  At camp, he makes two new friends.  Annabeth is the daughter of Athena, godess of wisdom.  Grover is a satyr.  Grover is in a wheelchair when he is with full humans.  The three of them spend the summer at the camp training to be like the gods.        The three friends go on a adventure when Percy is accused of stealing Zeus's lightning bolt.  They must prove that Percy did not steal it.  They travel across the country to Los Angeles.  Los Angeles is the entrance to the Underworld.  When they get to Los Angeles, they see that there has been an earthquake.  The earthquake was caused by Zeus's lightning bolt.  The lightning bolt came down and landed in a crack in the earth.  Percy picks it up and decides to go to Mt. Olympus to return it to Zeus.         The three friends hold a fundraiser to get money to pay for the flight back to New York.  Mt. Olympus is located 600 stories above the Empire State Building.  Percy returns the lightning bolt to Zeus.  Percy also sees his father, Poseidon, the god of the sea.  Poseidon is proud of Percy and his accomplishments.       Through all of this, Percy also has to solve the riddle of the oracle.  The oracle states \\"you shall fail to save what matters most in the end.\\"  The oracle has to do with his mother.  In the Underworld, Percy decides not to save his mother's life.  Instead, he wants to stop the war between the gods.  He leaves his mother with Medusa's head so she can make her own decisons.  Things turned out well for Percy.  His mother is still alive, he prevented a war between the gods, his friends are doing well and Percy has become a hero.       I loved this book because I enjoy Greek mythology.  This book made the gods come alive and live in modern day America.  It was very easy to read and I can't wait to read the second book in the series.  There are four books in the series and the fifth one will be printed next year.  Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a great series and I recommend it to any kid who likes adventure stories.

0525478183|5.0|When they were nine years old, Quentin Jacobsen and Margo Roth Spiegelman found a dead man beneath a tree. Now, at eighteen, in their final year of high school, they break into Sea World and dance at dawn.    Margo Roth Spiegelman is a girl who believes in random capitalization because \\"the rules of capitalization are so unfair to the words in the middle.\\" She is a girl who \\"loved mysteries so much that she became one.\\" She is the girl who during the years since their discovery of the body under the tree Quentin has loved from a distance, from across the halls of their high school-given that Margo has become a member of an \\"in\\" clique.    On the night of their Sea World adventure Margo, appears at Quentin's bedroom window for the first time since they were children. Dressed as a ninja, Margo coaxes Quentin to join her on an evening of vengeance as she sets out to \\"bring down the rain\\" on those friends whom she feels have betrayed her.    The next day, Margo disappears from Jefferson Park, an Orlando subdivision. When he learns of her absence, Quentin believes it is his responsibility to find her and bring her home.    While his closest friends, Ben and Radar, become increasingly caught up in prom preparations, Quentin becomes obsessed with his quest to locate Margo. He is convinced that she has left him clues to her whereabouts, especially clues embedded in lines she has underscored in a worn copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass.    Quentin's search leads him to various south Florida \\"pseudovisions,\\" unfinished and abandoned subdivisions. He believes these subdivisions are the paper towns that Margo had referred to as empty and phoney on the night he assisted her with her vendetta.    Paper Towns is the most honest novel for young adults that I have read recently. Green's characters are believable people. They represent a genuine cross-section of teenage behavior that is likely to be found in any contemporary American town. Senior high school students ought to read Paper Towns before they graduate.    Armchair Interviews says: Young adults need to read this book.
0307269752|4.0|Having for several years been enamored with a marvelous, real live Swedish girl, I came to this novel comfortably familiar with Sweden's history, geography, economy, and the general social situation.  Many of the things that bothered some critics, like place names and the value of the kronner, are easily overcome, especially with the Internet [one kronner = around 15 cents US].<br /><br />Stieg Larsson had a first rate talent, and his Lesbeth Salander is a superb example of this. You quickly get a protective ache for this girl's welfare, and applaud when she triumphs over the bullies who try to make her a victim. And it is truly heartbreaking when Lesbeth tends to her mother, who clearly prefers her other daughter, Camilla, who has stopped seeing both her mother and Lesbeth.<br /><br />The story is heavy going, and at times Larsson himself gets tangled up. At one point, for example, he has old Henrik Vanger describing faimly relationships to Blomkvidt, and instead of using the pronoun 'I', he says \\"Henrik\\", just like he is refering to the family chart instead of his own memory.<br /><br />But the big thing that disturbs me the most with this novel is heavy sexual freedom the good guys/girls have with one another. Blomkvidt, separated from his wife, spends a lot of time hopping in and out of the beds of 3 of the women.  Salander is many years younger than Blomkvidt, and Berger, his colleague at the paper, has a husband. James Bond aside, it is simply not plausible that Blomkvidt can get away with the enormous intellectual energy required to do the job he was hired to do, and still be in thrall with obvious lust.<br /><br />All of these good guys/girls have high standards of what is noble and ethical in man's public morality, but fail miserably in personal sexual responsibilities.<br /><br />Shakespheare said it best---<br /><br />\\"So, oft it chances in particular men,<br />that from some vicious mole of nature in them...<br />By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,<br />Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,<br />Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens<br />The form of plausive manners; that these men,<br />Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect...<br />His virtues else, be they as pure as grace...<br />Shall in the general censure take corruption<br />From that particular fault.<br />[Hamlet, Act I, Scene IV, lines 25 - 38}me habit that too much o'er-leavens  The form of plausive manners; that these men,  Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect...

B000LAZDQA|5.0|When the young gentleman at the video store told me it had the most graphic sex he'd seen second only to XXX, I almost didn't rent Shortbus.  XXX gets really boring.  From experience, I can tell you it is more interesting to sleep with the people who make XXX than to watch their work. As I kept running across references to Shortbus in my reading, I took a chance.  It is rare in how direct it is about what it has to say, and so brutally honest in what it is portrayed.  Movies of this genre are often just so over the top to be tedious. The average viewer-if there is such a thing-will indeed see that finding different approaches to sex is that important in some people's lives. It makes it painfully clear that the prices to be paid for such knowledge aren't for the faint of heart.

B0017I0KVI|3.0|You know, I didn't hate this book. I thought it couldn't possibly live up to the original and in many ways it doesn't. No writer alive could live up to Jane Austen; however, if you loved Emma and are looking for a way to extend the experience a bit, this book fills the bill. Grange attempts to add surprise to a well-known plot primarily in her handling of some of the minor characters. Since it wasn't too hard to see where she was headed with them it's debatable whether she achieved her object. I found it interesting though that her evident sympathy for Miss Bates leads her to a more sentimental conclusion than Austen would have permitted. The book is rather lacking in dramatic tension, though it's interesting to see some events through Knightly's eyes. His antipathy for Mrs. Elton seems a bit overdone -- certainly it never appears in the original novel, except in his comment about Emma choosing better for Mr. Elton than he chose for himself. If you liked Emma and want to ramble around Highbury again, this is a pleasant read. If you're looking for Jane Austen, you'll likely be disappointed.
B000H0MKOC|2.0|This has been described as a \\"razor sharp\\" satire. It isn't. The main character is a tobacco company lobbyist who defends tobacco interests. The problem here is that we knew that these guys were weasels over forty years ago - this is hardly cutting edge material. Many, many obvious jabs at this type are made. This film will only be an eye opener to someone who has been in a coma for the last few decades. The ending, where the lead character feels some moral responsibility toward his son is phony. The movie spends most of its running time showing us how utterly amoral the character is. Are we really supposed to believe that he suddenly feels remorse because of his son? More likely (and I know this type), he would keep his son in the dark about the true nature of his work. Katie Holmes looks horrible here. She can't act, has bad skin, and seems badly miscast as the \\"hot\\" reporter who seduces the handsome Eckhart (you would think that the gorgeous Eckhart would have women lined up but he seems so desperate that he has to settle for the odd looking Holmes).

0375831002|5.0|Liesel Meminger and Death are not strangers.  She saw him when he took her brother's soul.  And he kept tabs on the interesting little girl throughout her life until it was time to take her soul.  In between, he took the souls of many of her loved ones and even more strangers.  After all, it was Nazi Germany, WWII was raging at home and abroad, and there was no lack of lives lost and souls to reap.    11-year-old Liesel was taken in by foster parents when her mother could no longer take care of her.  Frightened by her new surroundings and by the recent loss of her brother, Liesel had heartwrenching nightmares night after night.  But her new Papa, Hans Hubermann has a heart of gold and becomes the father she did not previously have.  Her new Mama, Rosa, subscribes to the book of tough love and cuts Liesel no slack.  But with her new parents and her best friend, Rudy, she finds a place on Himmel Street and finds herself.  She discovers the power of words when her father teaches her to read and write.  And it is these words that motivate her to become a book thief.  She steals the books she cannot afford to buy and they become her most prized possessions.      This is a book of humanity set in a time when there was so little of it.  It is the insight into the plight of the Jews as experienced by sympathetic Germans.  It is Death's insight into humans and \\"his\\" observations of our nature.  It is moving and beautifully written.  The pages fly and you will not want to put it down.  A unique perspective on Germany during WWII, this book is not to be missed.
B001FBSMW6|1.0|As a diehard Keane fan who truely appreciates their two previous masterpieces (hopes and fears, under the iron sea) this one is not in that class.  But, I will take (perfect symentry) for what it is and enjoy it!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|A science fiction film is hard to come by these days. Because mainly we as a society have ran out of good futuristic ideas. Though this plots seems a little used they completely reinvent the idea. Even using sci/fi to create an eerie mood with a disturbing character added to the cast of astronauts. The plot-The sun has exstinguished and therefore we have sent a ship into outer space with nuclear bombs attached to it that will ram into the sun and hopefully reignite it. Along the way many problems occur and I will not ruin in plot developement. But I highly suggest this movie its a wonderful ride.
0767827902|5.0|So, was Cinema Paradiso in part inspired by Bogdonovich's masterpiece? Well, Analene, Texas sure aint Paradise. But it's a fabulous, timeless piece of art that doesn't wear, inspite of, or because of its tender appraisal of universal themes. I know the personell involved proceeded to further work, but how many of them could profess to anything superior? Certainly not Bottoms or Bogdonovich. The special features film tied to this edition under review, with its in-depth focus on a refective director, expresses the very special chemistry that occured on the shoot between the crew. It clearly translates onto the screen. Having lived in such a desperate environment in the 1960s, in the semi-arid mallee region of Australia, the story, the characters, the very town,almost building for building, even the lake, were replicas of McMurty's script. No wonder I love the guy's writing. And Bogdonovich too must have lost himself in it also, to have gone this deep, this committed.
0767903862|3.0|I read Bryson's \\"A short history of nearly everything\\" and I did enjoy the book.  However when reading \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" I have to say I was disappointed at the overall tone of the book.    While fans of Bryson may think he is humorous, most of his humor falls flat and somewhat tasteless especially in his cavalier treatment of the beloved game of Cricket.   Please, if you don't understand cricket and never grew up with it, you have no clue what you are talking about, and the attempted humor was pathetic.    Another thing I find mildly offputting is that he mentions in the beginning of the book that it feels great to land in Australia where everything seems similar to America and how civilized it is, and that people look like you.  Is he saying that the people are white?  So if I was not a white person I should feel uncomfortable?  There are many other countries not too far from Australia where the people may not look like Bryson, but that does not mean one can't feel comfortable and feel that people of those countries are friendly.       It also appears that all Bill Bryson and his traveling buddy want to do is find bars and drink excessively.  He does not really explore the culture of Australia in a deeper sense, it reminds me more of two college kids driving through another country.    Overall the book gave me a decent idea of Australia, but now I am not sure how accurate it is.

B000000ZKD|5.0|I looked for this CD every since I heard \\"She's So Heavy\\" on a local college radio show.  The CD is a wonderful interpretation of the Abbey Road Tracks by the Beatles.  Booker T and the MG's put a shine to this material instrumentally as only they can do.  This is such a nice CD to relax to.  I would recommend this to any Booker T/Beatle fans!  Many times the organ sound makes it sound like Gary Brooker of Procol Harum is playing and that's a compliment.  So that sonic texture is there too, like a cherry on the cake.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|What a hypocrite!  The limousine liberal Gore lectures on the dangers of global warming, yet he is seen frequently in the video riding in the back seat of a large sedan rather than in a Hybrid.  In one shot, he is boarding an empty, fuel thirsty Boeing 747.  I guess it's OK for Gore emit vast amounts of Greenhouse gass since he is saving the world, but not for the common folk like me.    The video does make a compelling argument.  My issue is with the almost next President.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|First off, this package is well worth the money. It includes all of the movies, including the animatrix, as well as every piece of dvd extra that came out after each dvd on a bonus dvd. Nothign from the official Matrix catalogue is omitted from this package. It also includes an ingenius set of commentaries done in a way you've never seen before. It actually does a lot to expand on the mystery and philosophy of the series and give your personal viewpoint more fuel to back it up whenever someone next tries to tell you these movies are total crap. It also has a nice, small, but quality package and does the job in terms of design.<br /><br />I also wanted to say that I will never understand the plethora of moviegoers out there that dislike anything past the first movie. The first movie was outstanding and probably the best of the three, without a doubt, but Reloaded is unbelievable in its own right, as is most of Revolutions. People seem to think that the first movie was going to be remade twice and turned into a trilogy. This series was always the Wachowski brothers view on the world, their answer to or further distortion of the question why, and their ultimate vision of so many things human and divine. It was a sci-fi story to begin with and they did their best to make it viable in that genre while keeping to the original idea of the Matrix. Personally, I would agree that Revolutions could have been much less about Zion and the huge mother-of-them-all machine battle, but it still brings to a close the magnificient story and vision of the filmmakers.<br /><br />The one thing I do find among people who usually dislike 2 & 3 is that they usually lack any real knowledge of all the underpinings of the story and where it was going, what it meant, or simply dislike too much philosophy in general. As someone who enjoys philosophical debates and thinking about these topics, I've encountered plenty who think philosophy is a joke. Usually it's those people who simply don't understand any of it.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you're a fan of the series and want to see/hear it in its absolute best form, then go out and get this blu-ray. If the price bothers you then just wait for it to go lower on ebay 2 months from now. Something this good is surely worth the money..    Anyhow, if you're a fan of the series and want to see/hear it in its absolute best form, then go out and get this blu-ray. If the price bothers you then just wait for it to go lower on ebay 2 months from now. Something this good is surely worth the money.
B000GW8VTO|5.0|All i can say is i cried during most of this movie.We did not lose this war.Politics lost it.I know i was there,and it's the first and last time the N.V.A.regulars came out to meet us man to man.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr which is the third book in the now Inheritance Cycle is a very good read it's better then the previous two books by far in my opinion, and it shows that Paolini is maturing as a writer.     Brisingr starts off a few days after \\"Eldest\\" left off with Eragon, Roran, and Saphria in Helgrind searching for Katrina who has been held prisoner. Here we can see that Eragons skills have improved both as a Dragon Rider and a magician testing his skills. The book starts out at this point and although im might drag at times in certain places it still has a fast pase most of the time. In Brisingr Eragon will have many things to do including finding a new weapon sense Zar'roc has been taken my Murtagh, he will also have to oversee the Dwarf election for a new king and try to reach the ultimate goal of defeating the evil king Galbatorix once and for all.    All in all Paolini crafts a wonderful third book that is sure now to disappoint if you have like the previous \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\" and as stated earlier it dose drag along in some places but is a very enjoyable read in all. 5/5

1932907009|5.0|\\"GIVE US THE SAME...ONLY DIFFERENT!\\"  It's an Hollywood addage that makes a lot of sense, yea?  But it can confound fledgling writers like me.  STC changes that.  Pure and simple.  If you want to understand WHY movies act, look, smell and feel the way they do, and WHY THEY SUCCEED TIME AFTER TIME, buy this book.      Blake Snyder has a very powerful gift: he understands how successful films are structured...and, more importantly, he CAN CONVEY THAT UNDERSTANDING to people like you and me.  Seriously, STC is clever, witty, and full of more practical insights than the Tao Te Ching.    If you expect to write screenplays, BUY THIS BOOK TODAY.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Heard rumours that a Nolan cut thats over 3 hours is going to be released for the big screen. I guess that would be the version to get. The problem with all these \\"epic blockbusters\\" is that there will be infinite versions in the future, and if you're old enough, you'll probably remember the laser disc days and T2 e.g. I don't know how many versions and box sets came out on laser disc and then it continued on DVD. Look at Blade Runner :)
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Great album! I heard this band's first hit bat country, and thought it was good. Then, they released this album, \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\". It is GREAT. A must buy for any hard rock enthusiast! Checkout their video for afterlife. The video is what made me buy the album. This is the next big band to break through!
0061122416|5.0|I appreciate The Alchemist for what it is, and to me, it is special. I am a writer and I often write about that special place inside we all have and can touch at any given time. The Alchemist not only touches that special place within me, it also seems to be a story about another's special place and on his journey he finds out how to touch and use it for himself. Having ADHD I can truly appreciate the style of writing and directness used to relate the meaning to the reader and I believe this was the intent of the writer. Too many books leave its meaning somewhere in the plot for us to guess at and contemplate over and over again what really was or could have been. Those books are good too, but for me, my mind can truly appreciate some direct insight which isn't buried too deep that I become distracted. I read The Alchemist in two days and plan to read it again as it is truly a classic to me.<br /><br />Author of:<br />[[ASIN:0741444402 One Boy's Struggle: A Memoir: Surviving Life with Undiagnosed ADD]]<br />Bryan Hutchinson
B001C08RHA|5.0|Very strong movie that stands up there with the original Batman with Michael Keaton and the original Spider-Man with Toby Maquire, and let's not forget about Superman!  Who knows if they'll ever make a decent Hulk, X-men or Avengers (coming soon).  Good modern adaptation of the story.  Ending was a bit heavy, and I wasn't particularly enamored with Bridges role, but Downey and Paltrow worked great.  They'll have to get creative with SHEILD for the sequel to work.
015206396X|5.0|I totally loved this book.  I thought, \\"Oh boy, yet another hobbit-like fantasy book\\" which seem to come a dime a dozen.  I thought it would be cliche.'  I was wrong.  The approach was refreshingly different in my opinion. I was very pleased and became engrossed in the story.  The story took some unexpected twists and turns and was decidedly much less predictable than I had expected. I look forward to more stories by this young author.  She is really quite good and I suspect as she gets more experienced she could find a following if she hasn't already.  I know I will be one of them.
B000V86OKG|4.0|The second season wasn't as focused as the first season - I still loved the show. I don't want to give it away, but the Dexter/Doakes thing should've played out a little longer. I didn't care for the comical juggling act Dexter managed through the last episodes and I would've liked to have seen him dispose of more predators. In any event, I watched the season from start to finish as quickly as possible. I think Michael C. Hall is proving himself to be quite the star. He's still likeable as your friendly neighborhood serial killer. Despite these reservations I recommend the series.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I think that Death Magnetic is a great album.  Yes it sounds a little \\"cleaner\\" than other Metallica albums but it is still great.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|I was a little bit skeptic when I bought this album.  It was my first exploration into the world of Shinedown.  Luckily, when I listened to the album for the first time I could not find a song that I didn't like.  Each and every one is absolutely perfect.  It has fast songs like Devour and Sin With a Grin, plus slower songs like If You Only Knew and What A Shame.      I let my mom borrow the cd to listen to in her car soon after I got it.  Now, she is in love with it too and refuses to give it back.     This album has quickly become one of my favorite albums of all time, which is no small feat considering I have amassed almost 5,000 songs in my collection.  I recommend this album to anyone who wants to rock and who just loves great music.  You can't go wrong with The Sound of Madness.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I love it. The orchestra adds a certain epic sound to the already great music of Metallica.
0767817478|3.0|OK, the monster design is good - BUT IT'S NOT GODZILLA!!!  I was one of many who anticipated this film, when perhaps dreading it would have been wiser.  I would have liked it better had it been a remake of \\"Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\\", since that film lacks the legendary status of the Great Gray-Green One.  It simply doesn't deserve the name, since the monster can be killed, and has no radiation-breath.  The whole point of Gojira/Godzilla is the concept of a living creature that has the status of a tsunami or earthquake: it causes massive, widespread destruction just by walking around; you can't stop it, you can only try to get to shelter (if there can BE shelter from something that weighs about 30,000 tons and breathes a combination of fast neutrons and Beta particles and Gamma rays) and rebuild after if you survive.  Also, you'd better pray he doesn't SEE you.  And one more thing: HE COULD COME BACK TOMORROW, AND THE DAY AFTER THAT.    So this big lizard may be neat, but it AIN'T Godzilla.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|this is one of the best movies of all time!!<br />Heath Ledger was amazing!
B000F3TBIO|2.0|I really like what Mike Patton did with Faith No More and what he does now with Dan the Automator (ex. Lovage - Music to make love to your old lady by).  I hated his \\"noise\\" experiments with Fantomas, Tomahawk, Mr. Bungle.  Now with Peeping Tom, the tracks are actually songs, but they're just not any good.  The guy has mad talent and I like his voice, but he stepped up to the plate here and struck out on all tracks.  Not a single decent one you'd want to listen to again.<br /><br />All the 5-star reviews are straight Patton fanboys that would give him 5-stars for punching them about the head and upper body.

I thought that is was really well done and I liked watching Richard Armitage.  OK - he is my new favorite British actor.  You can get a synopsis of the story from another review.  The acting is really good and the sets are great. I just love the last scene... I purchased this as part of the Elizabeth Gaskell Collection.  It is very much worth watching.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I once interviewed Rick Rubin, landmark producer of such acts as the Beasties, Chili Peppers and Slayer, and I asked him if he could produce one band's music that he hadn't already, who would that be. Without hesitation, he responded, Metallica.    Always wondering what the thunderous paw of their music might sound like under his watchful ear, the world now knows. And the result is nothing short of a musical revelation.    Death Magnetic is not only Metallica's finest album ever, but it may already rank as one the finest metal discs of all time. Every sweeping, swooping, epic track flexes every bit of the band's musical writing muscle. Even super die-hards would have to admit that every previous Metallica disc suffered at least one bump in the rocky road (sorry, lifers, even Kill `Em All had \\"Metal Militia\\"). Magnetic not only has zero clunkers, but every track would probably be among the standouts on any previous disc. Imagine \\"One\\" multiplied by ten.     Magnetic isn't just a return to form, it's a re-invention of the band. And, really, that makes Rubin the superstar here. Throughout the band's Bob Rock-produced era, things were soft and safe and self-conscious. You could hear the band out-thinking every hook and tempo change. Even Lars' bass drum sounded off - like it was recorded in another room and was just sort of echoing into the hall.     With Rubin at the helm the music has never been so fast, so tight, so intricate and so in your face. Drums crash through sneering guitars and the interlocking riffs form a dizzying musical puzzle; a tapestry of metallic bits and pieces that flow fluidly in a way that leaves you in disbelief that something so intricate can sound so easy.     If you were a fan....you'll become one again.
0440237688|1.0|It was awful!  I DO NOT recommend anyone read it.  Maybe some people would like it, but not me.  I kept reading it, hoping it would get good, but it just got worse.  And the worst part about it was that at the end, I seriously felt like the book had somehow taken something from me.  And I don't mean just my time.  Now I'm just trying to get it out of my head.  It had the potential to be really interesting, but I just don't think it quite got there.  Someone said it was rushed at the end.  I agree.  It felt like the author just kind of gave up.  I was hoping that the novel would redeem itself somehow, but no such luck.  I would be horrified if my child were required to read this in school.  I don't believe in censorship, but it shouldn't be required reading.  The reading level may be for younger readers, but certainly not the topics discussed in the book.  What were the Newbery people thinking?!
031606792X|5.0|I was a little late getting around to reading a book about vampires, but with some reluctance, I joined to masses and starting reading.  I can't say enough about how much I loved these books and the final, Breaking Dawn.  I tried to read through it slowly so I could make my time with the characters last.  I love Bella and Edwards love story.  After reading some reviews, I'm blown away at how literal people have taken the stories.  People, it is a book based on a complete fairytale.  Some people were shocked by Bella's choices, sex, marriage, parenthood, but as far as the sex goes....she's a teenager and believe it or not, but that is what most teens in relationships are thinking about.  I thought Stephenie wrote brilliant, engaging, and hard to restist stories and I for one was sad to see the series end.  Thank you!
0810995212|5.0|It is a very valuable addition to the extremely limited number of works (books or videos), done on one of the greatest painters/illustrators in America. It provides us with an impressive number of high quality  reproductions of Leyendecker's paintings. Through the reproductions, one can see the outstanding skills and techniques that he mastered to an  astonishing degree. They also show the attention he paid to detail.  Some of the most interesting reproductions are of detailed studies in oil on canvas (which, incidentally, sometimes rival the finished paintings!!), showing the kind of research, time, and effort he put in his art.  Finally, we can easily see why his work had gained the admiration of all Americans: not only his models were extremely handsome (especially Charles Beach, his favorite model and life companion),  but they were exquistely elegant, with style and sophistication.  In the absence of motion pictures, TV, and colored photos, one could imagine the effect of these fabulous illustrations on the American public in the first half of the 20th Century.  The book also gives extremely interesting and rare insight into Leyendecker's life, especially his young years.  Very little is known about him since he was an extremely private person, and especially that he ordered that his photos and other memorabilia would be burned after his death.  Thus, we discover (for the first time, I beleieve!!), that his family was of German origin, and not Dutch as it was previously believed. We also learn about the unfortunately difficult relations inside his family, especially the sad developments in the life of his brother Frank (a brilliant artist in his own right), and the extreme tension between him and Charles Beach. We also have a glimpse of his wonderful sister Mary, who dedicated her whole life to her two brothers: Joe and Frank.  Finally we also discover that they had a fourth sibling: a brother ... also an artist!!  The only thing missing which I would have liked to see is an indication of where the original paintings are now.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|Don't be afraid, but you will hear shades of Human League, David Bowie and other elements of late 80s pop.  But it's Keane, and for the most part, they pull it off wonderfully.  The title track alone is worth the purchase - simply the best thing they've done.  Even the Meatloaf/Jim Steinman-like choral interlude works to set up the rousing finale of that amazing song.  Certainly more ebulliant than their somber \\"Iron Sea\\" and as creative in its own way.  Expectations may have been unrealistic, but this is a quality effort.  It's different, but you won't be disappointed.  I thought the new James album would be hard to compete with, but this is close.
B000RMQH30|4.0|I've sort of lost interest in Ben Harper over the years, even though I was a raving fan a few years ago. I thought his music had become too formulaic and cliché. His first three albums are stellar...but I couldn't get into his new music. Then I saw reviews from Amazon members about how good this new album, Lifeline, is. I was skeptical at first, but I thought I would give it a try.     Once the album arrived, I was pleasantly surprised with the eco-friendly packaging. The album is made from recycled paper, no plastics, and it uses low VOC inks. I opened it up and was disappointed that there were no pictures of Ben in the booklet. Please! I need to see pictures of Ben's hotness! There are only images of his band-mates.    Anyway, the first few times I heard the album, I was luke-warm about it. It seemed overly simplistic and still cliché. I thought some songs could be Black Crowes or Neil Young songs. I especially don't like his low voice on the first track. But then the more I listened to it, the more I loved it. Ben is simplistic and simplicity is beautiful. His songs ring true and even the jingly little rifts are full of feeling. I finally can get behind this album and say it is a superb work. Just the fact that it is not digitally enhanced by pro-tools gives it an authenticity that I love. The only thing more I could have asked for would have been more of his beautiful weisenborn solos.

Is this a quality remaster? Is there anyone out there?
0765348276|5.0|I haven't been reading a lot of SF lately, but this just got me started again. Scalzi's open tribute to [[ASIN:0441783589 Starship Troopers]] updates Heinlein's starry-eyed idealism, but without the all bitter sense of loss from [[ASIN:0312536631 The Forever War]]. Well, maybe a little.<br /><br />A few points didn't work so well for me. Lots of people die in this story - well, it's war, so that happens. If there's some character that you really hate, though, you can bet that guy is going to get it in some remarkable way. It was just too predictable. The other annoyance was the number of alien species who think you and I would be good with fava beans and a nice Chianti. C'mon.<br /><br />If you can get along with that part, though, you'll find likable characters, good adventure, and a startling but engaging romance.

B00005YXZH|1.0|I have always like this band......Jeff Tweedy's band following the break-up of Uncle Tupelo.  However, it amazes me that anyone who listens to this CD can give it 5 stars.  It is an amalgamation of incoherent, irritating and unlistenable noise.    Those who grade this with more than one star are either band members, close friends of the band or those who think of themselves as music afficionado's who know more about music than you do (similar to liberal Democrats who believe they know how to spend your money better than yourself).  They can say to there snobby afficionado friends that they \\"get\\" this CD.  Other, \\"less intelligent listeners\\", do not understand the depth of this music.

1416594884|5.0|John Le Carre's \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" refers to twenty-three year old Issa Karpov, an emaciated and battered young man from Chechnya with \\"fiery, sunken eyes\\" who travels to Hamburg to seek assistance from Tommy Brue, the proprietor of a private British bank based in Germany. Issa's neediness and childlike demeanor soften the heart of a Turkish woman named Leyla when he comes to her home seeking shelter. Although she has problems of her own, Leyla takes Issa in and treats him as if he were her own son. Her real son, Melik, at first feels a deep aversion towards this \\"deranged vagrant...begging on their doorstep.\\" However, when he notices the bruises that Issa bears from the savage beatings that he has endured, Melik's heart melts.<br /><br />A beautiful German civil rights lawyer named Frau Annabel Richter, who works for a charitable organization called Sanctuary North, approaches Tommy Brue, and informs him that she is Issa Karpov's attorney. It seems that Issa's dead father, who was a malicious and violent man, left his son a sizeable legacy and Tommy has it in his power to make the young man a very wealthy individual. There are a number of obstacles, however. First, Issa is ambivalent about taking what he calls \\"blood money.\\" Even if he does request what is rightfully his, Issa must convince Tommy that he is the rightful heir to what turns out to be a sizeable fortune. Most alarming of all, a number of intelligence services have their eye on Issa, since they believe that he may be a link in a chain that will lead them to terrorists and those who support them.<br /><br />\\"A Most Wanted Man\\" explores the sociological and political changes that occurred in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Devout Muslims who attend the wrong mosques or who have unsavory associates may become suspects in the eyes of intelligence organizations. People like Issa are considered guilty until proven innocent. Brue, who at sixty has become world-weary, regrets that his late father Edward used his bank to shelter the money of disreputable individuals. Can Tommy redeem himself and perhaps win the heart of Frau Richter, a woman young enough to be his daughter? Tommy's marriage is on the rocks, and he does not look forward to spending his declining years alone.<br /><br />Annabel cares only about saving the unfortunate Issa, one of the \\"wretched of the earth\\" whom her organization tries mightily to assist.

B00005JPO1|5.0|This is an excellent addition to the Indiana Jones franchise.  I loved the beginning warehouse scene with the familiar music from Raiders.

B0013ND30M|5.0|What is so exquisite about Sleeping Beauty is that it looks like a medieval tapestry coming to life. If you look closely at the details in the backgrounds you can see little twists in the leaves and curves in the tree bark which overall gives an ornate and opulent look still refreshing to this day. It was the most expensive film in it's day, it took over four years to make and Walt Disney stated to his artists and animators that they should take their time over it, make it beautiful and so it came as a shock when it didn't do all that well in the cinemas. It wasn't really able to communicate to an american youth who were smoking things they shouldn't and it seemed this highly romantic film was too idealistic in it's portrayal of young love, it felt as if it should have been released earlier than the late 1950's, so culturally you can see that it wasn't able to make audiences identify with it. But this is probably the one Disney film which stands the test of time better than any other, artistically speaking; since the music is exemplary and the imagery and animation highly captivating, more so than anything Disney has attempted in recent years. In places it is so beautiful to watch.     The Disney studios today have developed the way they tell fairy tales now to another stunning level as 2010 will mark a new leap in visual storytelling for the company with the release of Rapunzel Unbraided, a computer animated film which has the feel and sensitivity of a traditional animated 2d film yet with the texture of an oil painting coming to life. For years now the company has been trying to reinvent their style, pushing their visual language to another stratosphere and they may well have done it in Rapunzel, but from what I have viewed it does echo slightly the romantic style of Sleeping Beauty, it's attention to detail is just as shimmering and splendid ... we'll have to see. We can see though that this film, Sleeping Beauty, set a standard which modern animators and film makers still aim for and that is why Sleeping Beauty is such an enduring work of art, as it really aimed to make animation a cinematic art form, it was ahead of it's time and held a maturity wiser than it's time.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|Keane's third album, Perfect Symmetry, is a throwback to the days of top 40 pop radio, 2008 style.  The band took a chance, experimented with their sound, and created a masterpiece that delivers from start to finish.  The album begins with the 80's retro sounding \\"Spiralling\\" which would have been a number one hit in 1986.  It is followed by catchy tunes like \\"The Lovers are Losing\\" and \\"You Haven't Told Me Anything,\\" two of the best songs on the album.  \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" is a passion-filled song that is placed at #5, the same place as the strongest songs on their previous albums.  Although not my favorite, it is a great song that the band feels is their best effort to date.  \\"Black Burning Heart\\", the second to last song, may be the perfect song.....catchy, cool, and full of Tom Chaplain's versatile voice.  It in my opinion, is the best song they have ever done and thrives when the volume is turned up.  It may be their big break in cracking the American top 10.  We'll see.    Say what you want about Keane, but this band has incredible talents in a variety of settings.  While this album certainly has a different feel than their \\"usual\\" sound, their music rings of super stardom.  This is no ordinary rock band.... Keane is here to stay.  Thankfully.

The younger priest that first meets the possessed chick doesn't even try to do it himself first before bringing in the other guy (again, no real explanation).  The self sacrifice at the end is empty and really didn't have any value (they left nothing behind as far as we know).  The detective is a joke, provides absolutely no value to the story.

0380713802|2.0|I've now read all of Bill Bryson's past and current work, and Neither Here nor There, with a few exceptional stories wasn't one of his best works.  This seemed to be a revisiting of places he had seen much earlier, and was pretty negative on most locations in Europe since much had changed, gone down hill, or been replaced by new buildings or vistas since he had been there the first time.  He tried to \\"go home again\\", but it didn't work out well, at least for him.  Still, he does describe some interesting places and provides tips on the pleasant ones.  This is a \\"maybe\\" selection.
B00001OH1S|4.0|This soundtrack, like the movie, is very nice, specially for the first song \\"Windmills of your mind\\" sing by Sting.
076790382X|4.0|I thought this was one of Bryson's best......short weekly column type stories on one subject.  They were humorous, to the point, and folksy.  He does (as he says himself) complain a bit too much, but if there's only one side to the story, it sounds like marketing material instead of a commentary.  Enjoyed this one.
B00005JPO1|5.0|This movie of Indiana Jones hits the spot ---- ENTERTAINMENT ----  In theory this story takes place 17 or 19 years after the first one?  HARRISON FORD is INDIANA JONES -- Well Jones is a character.  He has a innocent humor which makes the story hum.    Marion is back and just as gutsy as ever - and boy what a shocker she unloaded on Jones.    The colour, the scenes, the action [without pulling any of it apart] make for a fascinating, entertaining trip into enjoyment.    Lucas - Speilburg - Ford make the most entertaining movies worth watching.  Hey, what happened to Han Solo and his offspring?  Jones beat him to it.    Come on guys give us one more with Jones showing the ropes to Jr. on finding the lost treasures.  Mom can stay home with the twin boys and the baby daughter. [grin]  He must still be horseback riding - howabout setting out west and Indian territory.  Some body must have lost something.    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this movie and will be watching it over again many times. I love good, clean action adventure.
B00ANMA9L0|3.0|This album is ridiculously overrated.  \\"I Know What I Like\\" is the most childishly simplistic song, right along with \\"Trick Of The Tail\\" and \\"Counting Out Time\\", which I've read Genesis wrote with the intention of gaining mainstream favor, as if their idea of pop music was based on listening to kindergarten songs like 'Wheels On The Bus Go 'Round and Round'' et al.  \\"More Fool Me\\" is just way too quiet and soft, and lacking any sense of connection to opening track \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\".  \\"Firth Of Fifth\\"'s best moments are the several minutes of instrumental music.  \\"The Battle Of Epping Forrest\\" is more tolerable than \\"I Know What I Like\\", but it still has that kindergarten-esque melody.  \\"After The Ordeal\\" is pretty, and would be appreciated for that quality, but the 15 minutes preceding it are so wasted, I would expect something more along the line of \\"The Cinema Show\\", which comes AFTER \\"After The Ordeal\\", and isn't the most electrifying song to grace an album, but it's interesting, almost as much as \\"Firth Of Fifth\\"s instrumental passages, but not as moving.  \\"Aisle Of Plenty\\" is just a way to gently close the album, so that \\"The Cinema Show\\" and, subsequently, the entire listening experience doesn't have to be cut off abruptly.  It only lasts a little over 1 minute.  This album's running time is almost an hour.  Approximately 1/3 of it is worthwhile.<br />For a more complex and riveting listen, try this band's prior effort FOXTROT (1972).  The only wasteful spending on that album is the track \\"Horizons\\", which, like \\"Aisle Of Plenty\\", is only a minute or so.
B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Excellent continuation of Casino Royale.  They even give you the recipe to the now famous \\"Vesper\\" martini, with a bit more instruction in its preparation.  Great film, and twist ending I wasn't expecting!!
B0011UBDTK|3.0|Some of the disk's skip, which is annoying as hell, but overall its better than buying them separate.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I actually used to own the video of this, I liked it so much I got onto the net to see if I could get it in a dvd format-I love this work out particularly the free weights section at the end, there is a bit of thai chi stuff mixed in their as well, again it is low impact but a solid workout!!
B000J103OI|3.0|I bought this DVD for work- i work with teenagers to watch it in relation to the media portrayal of fashion and the bullying tactics in this movie-man meryl is a nazi in this movie-a good story line too-which is nice to see for hollywood!
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time by Mark Haddon is a remarkable book. Even though at many times it can be extremely random, it shows a great amount of character of the main character Christopher Boone. Christopher has autism. Even though he has autism and is an un-reliable character, i think it makes the book a little more interesting. In the book Christopher is trying to solve a murder. He himself is writing this book about a murder. I think that as a reader this makes the book a lot different than others. First of all I think it is very creative how Mark Haddon writes the book as if he were Christopher and he is trying to solve the mystery. I also think that it makes the book seem like kind of a mystery because you almost feel like you have to help Christopher since you sometimes know more than he does. But also in this book is the genre realistic fiction. So the book has to genres in one. So overall i think that this book was very good and well written. But i think it could have been a little bit longer.
0679424741|4.0|Despite good qualities, the novel is not without flaws. The most obvious one is that, despite McCullers' open-minded and liberal sensibilities regarding race, hers is still a viewpoint immured in its time, less of a blacks are equals tone than a pity the poor blacks tone. This is made especially clear with Dr. Copeland, who is portrayed, in some ways, as an intellectual superman of his race, part of the old `Talented Tenth', who is frustrated at how many blacks, especially his children, accept their roles as subservient shufflers and falsely smiling yes-men. Yet, even he is not immune to McCullers' backhanded putdowns, as, early on, this doctor, is shown reading the works of the philosopher Spinoza, yet not really able to fully understand it- as if a man who can understand human biology would really struggle with such. The fact that McCullers portrays the majority of her black characters this way shows a passive racism. Now, this would not be a major flaw in the book were one of the main foci NOT race relations, but it is, and this dates the book in ways A Tree Grows In Brooklyn does not suffer from. Many critics, in fact, have lauded McCullers for her pre-Civil Rights Era racial sensitivity, and foreshadowing of the evils of McCarthyism and anti-Civil Rights demagogues, but when one gets beyond Dr. Copeland himself, the eternal exception to her rule, one sees that McCullers' view of blacks is sadly mired in its day- a sort of old style racial noblesse oblige. Another flaw is excess description, at times. Because her writing is not that poetic, such excess does not serve as a `breather' from the narrative, and often does not serve the narrative in any substantive way, merely acting as filler. Here's an example: `This was her, Mick Kelly, walking in the daytime and by herself at night. In the hot sun and in the dark with all the plans and feelings.' Is the second sentence really necessary to qualify the first? Compare that with this passage, from the last few pages of the book, and the difference is stark: `Then suddenly he felt a quickening in him. His heart turned and he leaned his back against the counter for support. For in a swift radiance of illumination he saw a glimpse of human struggle and of valor. Of the endless fluid passage of humanity through endless time. And of those who labor and of those who- one word- love. His soul expanded. But for a moment only.'<br /><br />Yet, despite the fact that the book does not follow many conventional narrative tropes, it does follow a standard tripartite structure, and uses a standard third person omniscient voice. McCullers, herself, said that the book's structure was that of a fugue- where voices act antiphonally: `This book is planned according to a definite and balanced design. The form is contrapuntal throughout. Like a voice in a fugue each one of the main characters is an entirety in himself--but his personality takes on a new richness when contrasted and woven in with the other characters in the book.' In part one the characters, settings, and major themes are laid out. In part two each character's inner lives and failings are revealed, and the climax- Singer's suicide- occurs at the end of this section. And in part three the likely fates of the characters are limned.<br /><br />This fatality is one of the ways this book most differs, negatively, from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. That novel, laced with as much oppression and despair, ends on an up note (not the reason it's better) that is hopeful. Francie Nolan has a chance, a good chance, to surmount her past, even though, in many ways, her success was far less likely and less predictable than Mick's, who seems doomed. Both books are slices of life, portraits of bygone Americas in different places and times, but Betty Smith's Brooklyn seems far more vivid and real than Carson McCullers' South because it is more tightly drawn, less dated- thus more realistic, and more poetically mnemonically rendered. The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter also is a bit too long and too unfocused, losing its narrative thrust by going off tangent to things not vital to the main characters' tales, and were some of its excesses trimmed, it could pack more punch in just seventy-five to eighty percent of its length (356 pages). Still, this is, in a sense, nitpicking, and shows how far American literature has fallen because compared to what is routinely published nowadays this novel, despite its flaws, is a near-great book, every bit deserving of its niche in the canon.it too long and too unfocused, losing its narrative thrust by going off tangent to things not vital to the main characters' tales, and were some of its excesses trimmed, it could pack more punch in just seventy-five to eighty percent of its length (356 pages).

1400079179|2.0|Your book is a standard potboiler in which symbologist Robert Langdon becomes involved in the murder of the head of the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. A series of almost comically contrived `Aha' moments, dashes down dimly lit corridors, and Of course!'s litter the narrative. I realize most laymen are dullards, but seeing as you claim John Steinbeck as a hero, is it asking too much to at least try to write competently? If so, you are in luck, because this is where a good director or actor can actually add shades of gray to the banalities your prose offers. But, let's face it, the reason the book has sold reputedly over 8 million copies in hardback is because like Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ film it is milking the idiocy of die hard Christians. If you're gonna sully literature, at least the sullier should have a good cause- what's the excuse of a Dave Eggers?<br /><br />  Lemme summarize your tale: Langdon is implicated in the murder of the Louvre director, who also headed an ultra-secret sect called the Priory of Sion, who have schemed away centuries trying to protect the truth of the Holy Grail- which was not the Last Supper chalice but Mary Magdalene, herself- who was Jesus Christ's wife. Apparently Leonardo Da Vinci knew this as a former head of the Priory & embedded clues in paintings like The Last Supper & the Mona Lisa. Of course, Langdon is exonerated, & the real killers revealed. But Langdon chooses to keep the secret that Jesus was really a human, not a god, and that Mary Magdalene's tomb lies under the Louvre. Why does he do this? The old canard that the truth is too shocking for most laymen to handle. That's at least the interior book's reason. You and I know that the real reason is to leave the tale open for a sequel in which Langdon will not try to reveal the secret, but guard it.<br /><br />  Of course, your book is predicated on the greatest fallacy of all- that there ever was a man named Jesus Christ in the 1st place. History emphatically shows a gaping absence. Could you not have mentioned that at least once within the text, or even the Foreword? But, the real stir over your book comes from the many supposedly `true' facts you muster up regarding Leonardo, the Mona Lisa, & their connections to Jesus's bloodline. Of course, you claim to have researched this all meticulously. Of course, that's all bunkum, lest you would have written a non-fiction history. That so many have gotten worked up over a piece of stated fiction is beyond me. The closest parallel I can draw is to the furor a dozen or so years back over Oliver Stone's film JFK. There, Stone clearly presented his film as an alternate version to the manifestly fallacious Warren Commission Report. Here, you are merely tweaking Right Wing Fundamentalist Christian dolts, and have made millions by it. The book sucks, but I cannot deny my admiration for your niche marketing skills.absence.

0060730552|3.0|Joe has a taut, spare style of writing. Perhaps the only negative one can point to is that he goes a little too much into techno-speak on mountaineering. However, this is forgivable since that was the audience he was writing for. That the book became a general public bestseller was a surprise. In a sense he writes sort of like Mickey Spillane- with spare descriptions, clipped, but not as taut as MS. But, there are some soaring moments of poetry- especially one scene where Joe describes looking out of the crevasse at stars at night in a dreamy poetic way that makes a very familiar scene seem new. He also has taken Simon's story, told to him since they were separated, and crafted a compelling counter-narrative that acts antiphonally with Joe's own tale. We get to parallax the whole tale, which lends far more realism than a singular viewpoint would.<br /><br />  The only negative part of the book is the ending, in which little aftermath is given. While this is a good technique to start the book off with- we get little background information on Joe and Simon (later in the memoir we get a few digressions to past expeditions by them and others), and a few tantalizing hints as to the rich life Richard Hawking has led- we are so drawn to these characters that to not be given information feels a cheat. But, that would be acceptable had the actual ending been good, narratively or in its mere construction, or left us in a particular moment as we had been in other parts of the book. Instead we end the book with this dreamy recollection of Joe's being readied for surgery on his broken leg in a hospital a few days after his rescue, and his desire to not be operated on in Peru:<br /><br />  A strong hand pressed me back. Another gripped my arm and I felt the slight pain of the needle. I tried to lift my head but somehow it doubled in weight. Turning to the side I saw a tray of instruments. Above me bright lights came on, and the room began to swim before my eyes. I had to say something....had to stop them. Darkness slipped over the lights and slowly all sounds muffled down to silence.<br /><br />  That's it. After this rousing tale the reader is left with this wet noodle of an ending. This frustrates a reader far more than the slight drag a reader feels by reading of the duo's every single little mountaineering movement and the accompanying emotions they felt. That, at least, lent a compelling authenticity to the narrators' voices. So did the descriptions of the physicality of the men, mountain, and meteorological conditions. The end, alack....<br /><br />  That said, this book is far better written than most of the `creative writing' peddled at MFA programs. Had he gone there before writing this I'm sure the book would have been over twice its 184 pages, and larded with banal digressions that eked into every little detail of Joe's and Simon's childhoods, endeavoring to find the `real meaning' behind why Simon cut the rope. Fortunately, Joe's a better writer than that, and better than Simon, a part of whose book Joe quotes from in an afterword called Ten Years On.... It's obvious from the selection that Joe wrote Simon's soliloquy in his own book, and does a really good job of empathizing with the man a lesser man might scorn as someone who abandoned him.<br /><br />  It's rare that such an archetypal story is so concisely well-written, especially considering this was Joe's first effort- usually these sorts of Gilgameshian man vs. nature epics are long on the epic tale, and short on the ability to convey it.

1570627215|5.0|Siddhartha, a bildungsroman by Herman Hesse, first published in 1922, is simply one of the greatest books ever written. I say that not because I agree with its essential philosophy (which is problematic in some of its over-simplicity), a predisposition that far too often accounts for why critics recommend or do not recommend a work of art, but because it is the embodiment of one of the oldest maxims that defines great literature: saying the most in the least amount of words. Technically, the book- which I have read several times, the last over a decade ago, is a long novella of just under 40,000 words (in English translation- and I read the famed Hilda Rosner version; the original German may be a few hundred words longer or shorter) yet the amount and depth of information it reveals about its titular protagonist has rarely been equaled in works five to ten times its length. It is this remarkable poetic compression that is at the heart of the book's greatness; and a style rarely used. Recently, I just finished reading Isaac Asimov's Foundation And Empire (the second book of his original Foundation trilogy) and was struck at how similar the two (or three- counting the original Foundation) books were in their approaches to narrative and characterization. It is well known that Asimov's masterpieces- which go well beyond the sci fi genre- were based upon the excellent historical stylings of Edward Gibbon's The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire, and it is in that fact that the key to Siddhartha is turned.<br /><br />  Even though Hesse's book is fiction, and its lead is not based upon the real Siddhartha Gautama (the original Buddha)- although he makes a fictive cameo, Hesse employs the same pseudo-historical approach to the tale. This allows for him to leap over great periods in the main character's life by tossing off bon mots and facts as if they were generally known beforehand by the reader. Later, many of these observations are revealed or reinforced by the `on stage' actions of Siddhartha and his colleagues. Of course, this is not the usual style of character revelation- which is dependent upon scene setting, interior analysis, symbolism, etc. Instead, Hesse's narrative simply puts the characters into situations where they have to tell what they feel. Siddhartha encounters the Buddha, the prostitute Kamala, or the ferryman Vasudeva, and instead of `showing' us, he `tells' us what is going on with the characters. Yet, he does it so well that to `show' us would require the novel being stripped of all its originality, and fabular qualities, in favor of another didactic tract on how to live one's life. Yet, slyly, the very fact that the characters, especially Siddhartha, tell us so much reveals their character very effectively. Siddhartha, himself, glosses over years in a few sentences, but the very fact that he does not feel inclined to tell us- or himself in interior monologue- certain details says quite a bit about his way of dealing with the world and himself. Rationalization is a quality few characters have as a prime one, so the fact Siddhartha has it in spades sets him up very uniquely.<br /><br />  I see this form of characterization as `silhouetting' for what stays hidden, but can be presumed, is as important as that known. Asimov also uses this technique to great effect in his portrait of Foundation and Empire's villain The Mule. Little is known or revealed about the mutant until the last chapter, when all the hints coalesce into one of the great villainous perorations in literature; surpassing that of many arch-villains in thrillers and detective novels. The Mule, like Siddhartha, is sketched in great detail by all that is left out when key points are made. It's a wonder more writers have not picked up on this technique....It's no accident that the final image and focus of the book is not on the Western lead character, but his Eastern sidekick, for the book is an indictment, or, to be kinder, a trial of the Eastern way of life.<br /><br />  Whether it passes that test or not is for each reader to decide, as is the test all great art faces in front of its audience. To recapitulate the book's greatest virtue, I say: YES!Whether it passes that test or not is for each reader to decide, as is the test all great art faces in front of its audience.

B000MNP2K8|4.0|Forget the last 1,367 Bond movies, this one reinvents the character. When I first saw this, I was confused as to what it was, but later, I realized they were starting over. Bond enters a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. Le Chiffre, the bad guy tries to win, but Bond must beat him. With the help of Vesper Lynd, Bond must stop the bad guy. If you love action films and James Bond, you'll love CASINO ROYALE!!!!

Well, I got the CD in the mail yesterday and promptly discovered [as I raced to play my most most MOST favorite song from the movie] that even at my advanced age I am still apparently naive.  Buyer beware, the song they danced salsa to is NOT on the soundtrack.  Boooo...!!

B001DHXT2A|4.0|Action packed and kinetic. This one maintains a better pace than the first one. The first attempt tried to be very cerebral and focus on the inner workings of the characters, forgetting to put in some real action. Here, that has been rectified.<br /><br />The action is very well done and the effects of the Hulk character are about as realistic as you could expect a giant green man to appear.<br /><br />However, a couple of the fight scenes -- particularly the last one between the Hulk and the Abomination -- are filmed a little too close to really be able to easily follow the action.<br /><br />Other than that, this one is great. Here's hoping Marvel moves forward with the same love of their characters as they produce their own movies.
1416594884|4.0|It's easy to say LeCarre's lost his touch since the wall fell, and while some of his post-USSR books have been problematic, this is isn't among that group. It's a very traditional LeCarre, full of broken people trying to make things right. The main characters are achingly vulnerable, and the novel slowly builds to a tense climax. It's a shame he lets his bile over American actions spew forth on the final page .... it's the only real flaw in the book. LeCarre's at his best investigating shades of Grey, but he lets himself slip into black-and-white here.
0061440795|5.0|This book was published in 1954 when Francoise Sagan was 18 and presumably takes place at roughly the same time period. When one reads biographies of Sagan, one sees parallels between her life and the events of the book, and thus one gets the feeling that the book is either quasi autobiographical or heavily drawn from personal experience. The main character, Cecile, at 17 is roughly the same age as Sagan at the time of the writing of the book. She lives with her father, Raymond, having lost her mother at the age of two. In the beginning her father is with Elsa, an attractive, 29 year old woman, one of many who has filed through her father's life but no one of any intellectual or personal substance. Soon, however, her father, becomes involved with Anne, a friend of Cecile's mother, age 42 and someone, unlike most of her father's lovers, who is highly intelligent, cultured and with more personal depth. Anne and her father become engaged. Cecile, during this time, forms a romantic attachment to Cyril, a law student. The relationship between Cecile and Anne is alternately friendly and antagonistic and there is some competition for Raymond's attentions that escalates to a climax. The book is written with great sensitivity, clarity and vividness and a writing style that borders at time on the poetic. It's better in French if you know that language.[[ASIN:0595339557 Translator's Kiss]]
B001HDYK6Y|3.0|Following the first two albums Keane had become my favourite Brit Band. This is unfortunately a tepid follow-up.     Standout tracks like The Lovers Are Losing (#2), Perfect Symmetry (#5), Again & Again (#7),  Playing Along (#8) remind us how great this band can be. On the other hand, Spiralling (#1) and Better than This (#3) are pretty awful.     Even on awful tracks, Tom's superb vocals are a redeeming factor.  This one will probably grow with time but for now, I'm a tad disappointed.
B000JVT1U0|3.0|I went into the movie not knowing what to expect. I was familiar with the movie's storyline (having seen a clip on a top 100 show), but the majority of the film seemed strange. That pretty much sums up my viewing experience of the film.<br /><br />The story surrounds a young sargeant, Howie, who travels to a remote village in order to investigate the dissapearance (and possible murder) of a young girl. Once there he discovers that the villagers are heavily into pagan ways. Saying anything more about the plot would ruin many of the film's suspenseful moments & surprises.<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained by the film. The music in the film was absolutely gorgeous, and brought much of the film to life. There were many parts however, where the story seemed to lag & drag. I would give this film a total score of 3.5 on a scale of 1-5. It's definately a \\"must watch\\" for any fan of horror, but not entirely a \\"must have\\" for collection owners until they've watched it once.
B0000019PA|4.0|A quintessential lo-fi masterwork of acoustic power and unrestrained vocal, this highly influential album helped pave the way for the broken-boy aesthetics of Bright Eyes and literate ballads of Decemberists to be the prominent independent music it is today. Sure, some of the production should have been tuned up a bit even if the overall quality of hearing the performance right in front of you is partly why this album still shines bright, but mostly it is because the sincerity and simplicity coupled with thematic ambitions preserved this track listing better then it ought.
B000068FUS|5.0|The Drive-By Truckers are a still-thriving, though much-altered band as of this writing (October 2008). They recorded albums before and after  \\"Southern Rock Opera\\" (SRO was intially released in 2001), but this release represents their creative peak and probably their ultimate artistic statement...at least, so far.    Like many so-called \\"concept\\" albums, there's not always a straight-line, A-to-B narrative path here, although there is an overall similar vibe to many songs and there are clearly reoccurring subjects and themes. Some of the many, wide-ranging topics addressed (or at least touched upon) during these 94 minutes (spread over two discs) include: Alabama politics and cultural touchstones, dead-end small town life, Southern manhood, racism, heavy drinking and drug use as youthful escapism or as a coping mechanism, swamps, fatal car crashes (and the subsequent void left in the lives of the loved ones of the departed), Arena Rock of the 70's, and above all, Lynyrd Skynyrd. Skynyrd's story is mentioned or recounted in quite a few of the songs, especially during the Act 2 portion; the band serves as the ultimate symbol of Southern nobodies headed for nowhere who came from nothing to rise to near the top of the Rock world, but who plummeted to tragedy at their peak 31 years ago. Skynyrd's trajectory and the album's essentially follow one another, so that the tragic end of Lynyrd Skynyrd (The Ronnie Van Zandt-lead, \\"real\\" version of the band, that is) coincides with the end of the album.      Lynyrd Skynyrd's three-guitar attack is the blueprint for the music of this album as well, although this is not a Skynyrd impersonation and there are no Skynyrd cover versions. This is definitely Southern Rock but with a an edgy, modern vibe to it. The sound manages to be highly evocative of Skynyrd (and some of their imitators) while still mining a fairly original hard-driving vein. In SRO, a veritible stack of great songs is skillfully fleshed out with a definite Southernswagger and attack. It's surprising to find such a strong tribute to Skynyrd that doesn't resort to blind hero worship, maudlin sappiness or blatant imitation. The mightily rocking performances here are able to hold their own against any of the touchstone bands of the Southern Rock genre, including Skynyrd.    For those new to the DBT or the SRO album: the primary songwriting and thus lead singing is done by Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley. Cooley's smooth baritone coats songs like \\"72 (This Highway's Mean)\\" or \\"Zip City\\" in a gooey layer of southern-accented, easy-to-digest tones, which nicely offsets Hood's crackly, high tenor, gargle-with-Drano, Alabama-bred croak. That voice is definitely an acquired taste, but there's no escaping the emotional resonance of Hood's vocals on songs like \\"Angels and Fuselage\\" (the last song, yet reportedly one of the first songs written for this album) or \\"Plastic Flowers on the Highway\\". Adding a third voice to the proceedings is former DBT guitarist Rob Malone, whose \\"Moved\\" and \\"Cassie's Brother\\" (which also features a vocal cameo from Kelly Hogan) are great additions. Malone also supplies the lead vocals to the Hood-penned \\"Wallace\\", which is sung gleefully from the Devil's point of view as he anticipates the imminent arrival of former-segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace's soul into Hell.       Though a song or two can get a bit tedious (two spoken word songs, \\"Days of Graduation\\" and \\"The Three Great Alabama Icons\\", is about 1 ½ spoken word songs too many), this album bears up to many repeated listenings and delivers the gamut of emotions and moods for over an hour and half. Hope and despair vie for your attention, as they often do in subsequent DBT releases. The \\"rags to riches\\" cycle of the rock band, whether it's Skynyrd or the fictional \\"Betamax Guillotine\\" mentioned in the liner notes, occupies a fair share of the narrative. The whole package flows together quite well through different phases of blistering uptempo scorchers (such as \\"Guitar Man Upstairs\\" or \\"Shut Up and Get on the Plane\\") and slower, quieter numbers (\\"Birmingham\\" or the desolately lonely \\"Moved\\"). It's hard not to get choked up by the time the slow-motion ending of \\"Angels and Fuselage\\" crawls around---by then you'll realize that these guys have delivered one hell of a moving piece of work here. Though this music stands quite ably on its own merits, it'll also have a strange side-effect: it'll make you want to dig out your old Skynyrd stuff---and for all of the right reasons. If you weren't a Skynryd fan before this, falling in love with this DBT disc can serve as a perfect incentive to discover what all of the fuss was about with that band of Florida misfits back between '73 and '77.       This 2 disc set is a must for those looking for modern-sounding, guitar-based, gut-bucket-yet-intelligent Rock and Roll with a Southern twist. SRO has one boot firmly planted in the Southern Rock past and the other one wedged into the unfriendly, post-millennium music landscape where sounds such as these are an endangered species. They certainly show no fear about devoting a two disc set to a nearly outmoded style of Rock. Do yourself a favor and let this free bird of a concept album fly out of your speakers or headphones regularly.
B001FBSMW6|4.0|I like Keane's new direction.  Some songs are in their traditional style.  Other songs sound like they were backed by The Killers, produced by Brian Eno, or directed by David Bowie.  This album surprised me and that was a good thing because a return to the sound of Hopes & Fears may have sent me into a coma!  Good job overall!
B000N2HBSO|3.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a warm and engaging history of Lincoln's early political career and rise to the presidency. She weaves together the stories of his cabinet and their parallel lives to give a more nuanced, textual view of Lincoln's administration than more narrowly focused biographies.<br /><br />On the other hand, trying to provide meaningful insight into so many complex lives leaves the book with a sometimes disjointed and even superficial feel. There's enough depth to really get you interested, but not enough to sate your curiosity. That's pardonable, though--to have done otherwise the book would have had to have been six times as long.<br /><br />There's little in the book that you won't find in other biographies, but juxtaposing them all together has an original and dynamic effect. Goodwin's use of personality reminds me of the brilliance, insight, and warmth of America's other great historian-for-the-masses, Barbara Tuchman.<br /><br />Goodwin's love and admiration for Lincoln rubbed off so effectively that it was impossible to finish the book without concluding that he was the greatest man in history. This is a well written book that you will enjoy and learn from. Goodwin's inclusion of Lincoln's acceptance of Chase's resignation contains a line that qualifies as the finest, most diplomatic firing ever done in the English language: \\"Of all I have said in commendation of your ability and fidelity, I have nothing to unsay.\\"<br /><br />It's a very good read, especially on a Kindle.
B00001OH80|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Bowie, but his 80's habit of milking in on his fame is at its height in this album.  This phase in his career brings up the question of being a fan of the musician or the music; I'm a fan of Bowie the musician and enjoy just about everything he's released, but this album is one that I just try to ignore.  Here is my reasoning:<br /><br />1 it took him almost no time at all to spew this thing out, since it came out just after 'Let's Dance'<br /><br />2 a number of tracks are covers, not to mention the other tracks that were written with Iggy Pop for his own release(s), then re-recorded them on this album, showing he did not put a lot of creative effort into it.<br /><br />3 he does a duet with Tina Turner!  It may be my opinion, but what could be more mainstream edge than that?<br /><br />4 a 20-minute long film was made to promote the album; the film, in my opinion, was egotistical and had little to do with much except the song 'Blue Jean'.<br /><br />5 don't forget the huge touring Bowie did for this album, which showed him as his pompous best.<br /><br />I will admit a few songs are pretty good, but not nearly as strong as previous or latter releases (Scary Monsters, Let's Dance, Never Let Me Down).  It seems work was put into only the three singles that this album spawned, and I'd say that his next album, Never..., was much better single-wise.<br /><br />Altogether, this album is the biggest reason most people tend to shy away from his 80's material.
0937381888|5.0|Reviewer who states this book is \\"very basic\\" is WAY, WAY, whacked.  This is without a doubt the best home brewing book to start with and you will come back and reference it often after brewing for a while.  Exensively covers many ares of homebrewing.  It will answer just about any question you will have.  Palmer knows beer inside and out and explains everything clearly and concisely.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|I love a good 3-D movie. My first date with my wife was at a 3-D movie. I'm the author of Walt Disney World with Disabilities, and I've seen every 3-D movie at all the Disney parks more times than I can count (Now those movies have incredible 3-D effects!). Unfortunately the effects in this movie were very weak. The 3-D rarely seemed to pop out at the audience. If it did, it lacked impact. There was so much potential, but it just wasn't used.<br /><br />Now combine that with a very weak script, plot and character development, and poor special effects even without the 3-D involved, and you have this movie. A good sci-fi movie takes you out of reality and creates another world. You believe it's real for just a couple of hours and you live the adventure. This movie never managed that. We were rather bored.<br /><br />Brendan Fraser did a good job with what he had to work with, but it just wasn't much. I just can't recommend this movie as a purchase. Maybe just a rental if you have an unlimited rental deal.
B000002R0P|5.0|If anyone's worried Interview is the first step in the wrong direction for Gentle Giant, fear not, because besides a couple questionable moments that are overlong and repeat a bit much, this is definitely a quality album on the same level as the previous GG albums.    The odd time signatures, the vocal melodies that repeat a lot, but are quite catchy... all the things you love about the band have remained in check with Interview.  I sense the band was starting to feel worn out by this time in their career, which is indicated by the lyrics in a few of the songs, such as \\"Another Show\\".  My favorite song is \\"I Lost My Head\\".  Extremely good vocal melodies here.    There's one song on here that has a tropical vibe with lyrics about money (how appropriate with todays economy!)   I'm amazed the lead singers voice is still in incredibly good shape- he hasn't lost a step since the previous album.  This is just great rock and roll that's played in a complex, yet very satisfying way.
081541028X|5.0|Michele Collins sure has a unique personality, on one side he is a great American hero and history maker, on the other side his sense of humor is so overwhelming to let the reader feel close frindship with the man. Some of his comments made me laugh out loudly. I certaily recommend this book for both its scientific content and moral experience. The way he simplified scientific issues was astonishing. You'll love to read it more than once.
045122499X|4.0|I enjoy escaping to another place and time through reading a good book.  And with over 1000 pages, this book provides a lengthy escape.  It also provides some graphic violent details and sexual encounters (including both willing and unwilling participants).  The length of the story was not a problem, as the story did not drag on.  I did, however, have a problem accepting the part where the nuns head off alone across Europe to track down the Bishop just to tell him that the priests had stolen their money.  The 2 women dress in disguises and fall in with the French army as they march on towards battle.  Yes, the nuns were travelling to see the Bishop who was currently involved in the war, and the 2 women were following the troups across the country just to tattle on the priests back home.  Whatever.  So I didn't appreciate Follett's crude details at times, nor the diversion from Kingsbridge, but it was overall a good read.
0307388921|1.0|I have no problem with the fact that this book is pretty much soft-core porn.  I do have a problem with the fact that it is trying really hard to be meaninful but it's actually pointless, boring, and dumb.  If it wasn't for the dirty parts the freakin thing would be unreadable.
B001E7X4M4|5.0|Just as the subject of this review, this is a glorious return to form for the Boston metallers UNEARTH. ADAM D is back behind the scenes producing for this band. If anyone fully understand Unearth's sound it is Adam D. His production on the ONCOMING STORM helped propel the band into the metal mainstream helping them become the most success full and arguably the best metalcore band of all time!     I won't do a song to song breakdown (no pun intended), but I will reveal what elements of their sound made this album great. The infamous 7-Stingers Buz McGrath and Ken Susi deliver their best outing with blazing solos and sweeps to make any guitar guru's face melt off. I know Adam had a lot to do with pushing Ken + BUZ to their full potential.    Next, the Vocals. Trevor Phipps is at his best here! The lyrics are as always, in my opinion, some of the most thought out ideas in the metal scene today. The production of the vocals on this record are the best to date for an Unearth album. Once again Adam D at his finest, knowing Unearth's sound and the importance Trevor's voice contributes to it. I did not like how the vocals sounded in III: IN the Eyes of Fire, so I am glad it was done right here. His voice sounds more commanding and powerful then ever before. His voice is always one of the best parts of Unearth's live shows. His deliverance and enthusiasm always ensues chaos out on the dance floor!    Slo's provides his best bass lines to date on this release. If you watched the band's recent DVD, you will know Slo is a very smart man. He is a poker genius and has an IQ through the roof! It is unfortunate that he does not get the credit he deserves for his work, of course having to take a backseat to the fury of Ken & Buz's guitar work! Let me say, well done SLO!     Over the last year Unearth lost a great drummer, arguably one of the best in today's metal scene. Mike Justian was a gigantic reason for Unearth's might! That being said, they could not have found a better replacement. Seemless's Derek Kerswill, delivers one hell of a performance on this effort, filling gigantic shoes behind the kit for the band. Derek is a much better member for this band; he is a long time friend of the band, unlike Mike who was brought in from the Red Chord after their previous drummer quit to quickly learn the songs for THE ONCOMING STORM. He adds a dynamic to this band's chemistry that can only help to play out to Unearth's advantage in future offerings to come.    In closing: This record is amazing ladies and gentlemen! Do not read this review and go download it! Scroll up now and add this to your cart. 10 dollars is nothing for this amazing piece of work! Support this band and go see them live. Unearth is simply the greatest live act in today's metal scene. Buying this record is only 1/2 the full Unearth experience. Go to their myspace and find out when they are coming to your town. Thank you, *horns*!
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Heath Ledgers take on the Joker takes the movie up a notch but I think Batman Begins has a better cohesive story and is an overall better movie.  The movie should have ended about 45 minutes sooner, the Two-Face storyline could have been cut back. Still in the top 3 superhero movies with Batman Begins and Spider-man.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas is such a true work of imagination. The characters are touching and the music can easily get stuck in your head. It has just enough spook in it that even my 3 year old loves it. I also have a place in my heart for the bonus DVD which has a wonderful story on it called Vincent. I will never get sick of this movie...EVER!!!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|If I close my eyes while listening to this CD, I can relive the movie, which I loved! I really like Abba anyway but when you hear the music being done by the people in the movie, it comes more alive.
0385338082|4.0|Another good one from Kinsella. Entertaining, slightly predictable but definitely a good book. I think we all have the feeling of \\"Ooops anytime now they are going to figure out am I big fraud\\" especially when it comes to being new at work. I'm also just like Emma, telling lies not to hurt anyone and then getting all wrapped up in it not knowing what is right and wrong.     A colleague of mine once said that reading these types of books is like eating a box of chocolate, it is just pure pleasure. It has got everything in it that you wish for in a good chic flick and will put a smile on your face all through it.     The book doesn't get 5 stars because it is not as good as \\"the Undomestic Goddess\\" which is sligthly better but \\"Can you keep a secret?\\" is still worth your time. It will make a perfect company on a beach, in a cabin or just on a lazy Sunday.
B000BT97AO|4.0|I came to Mirrormask with no expectations other than that the film was Neil Gaiman's pet project, and anything Gaiman passionately believes in is something I wanted to see.<br /><br />Mirrormask's style is a combination of those psychedelic Beatles cartoons mixed with The Neverending Story, Legend, and Labyrinth - appropriate, since The Jim Henson Company helped create the virtual world where the movie takes place.  At its heart, Mirrormask is about a girl, Helena (Stephanie Leonides) and her independence from her mother Joanne (Gina McKee).  Like so many impetuous young girls in movies, Helena ranges from clingy devotion to her mother to feckless rage, and it's during one of her darker moments that she wishes Joanne dead ... which ends with Joanne in the hospital.<br /><br />The guilt that this tantrum engenders in poor Helena is enough to send her on a Hero's Journey.  And wrapped up in this journey isn't just a quest to save her mother, but to save herself; as an adolescent, there are clear signs that Helena is on the wrong path.  Throughout the bizarre universe that Helena travels, she discovers the duality of self: between darkness and light, affection and possession.  Windows are gateways to the real world.  Creatures have bizarre features or none at all, and the few humanoids that live in Helena's fantasyland all wear masks, which they believe are their real faces.<br /><br />And what a strange world it is!  Labyrinth was odd, but the protagonist was grounded in reality.  Helena comes from a junk pile universe of recycled material and garish display, and her imagination reflects her circus origins in every character and building. In that regard, Mirrormask is a breathtaking spectacle.<br /><br />Story-wise, Mirrormask isn't quite as interesting.  Helena discovers that she's not just in a dream world, she's actually switched places with her evil twin. While Helena is exploring her childlike fantasies her doppelganger is exhibiting, as child advocates say, \\"risky behavior\\" in her body. It's up to Helena to take back her real self, both physically and spiritually, and maybe save her mother's life in the process.<br /><br />Mirrormask is a surprisingly feminine fantasy, all too lacking in a genre dominated by sword and sorcery.  It's also marketed to a very specific niche, that of the tween heroine fantasy, and that might not go over well with everyone.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed it; I was so caught up in staring at all the backgrounds that I didn't always track the plot.<br /><br />Ultimately, Mirrormask is more of a tour of a bizarre universe than a movie, and worth watching with female company. You will never listen to \\"Close to You\\" the same way again.up to Helena to take back her real self, both physically and spiritually, and maybe save her mother's life in the process.

B000V86OKG|5.0|I just loved the DVD set.  It was not available at any local stores.  So I just bought it and loved it.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Stephens and Wilson bring a depth to the characters that I have not seen in any other versions. Rochester is brooding and bitter without being too harsh and Wilson balances emotion and restraint perfectly. They draw you into the characters like the book does. Loved it!
031606792X|5.0|I went through the whole series in less then 3 weeks, I LOVED every single book except the second one because Edward disappears for a huge amount of the book. I am still very sad there is ONLY 4 books I would love to know what happens with Renesmee and Jacob.    Some reviews here hate that this story had a happy ending, but I absolutely loved it. This book helps you escape the real life stress that everyone faces now a days and lets you fall back into a romance that I wish that I had.    I love EDWARD he has me heart even though I know he is not real haha    Buy and read all of the twilight series.. From my point of view it is one of the best series I have ever read    :D
0441009425|5.0|The entire Revelation Space series is a space opera of the highest order.  Alastair Reynolds has set the new bar by which science fiction of the new millenium should be judged.  Unlike many science fiction novels, the characters of the Revelation Space saga are highly developed and full of deep motivations.  Everything about this series will stay with you long after you close the final page.
0930289234|4.0|This was an interesting read. I was really into it in the beginning, then the middle part got a little wierd for me and then the ending was good. The art in the book was appealing and the intial storyline was intruigung. the story is a bit dated in my opinion with a lot of worry in the era of the cold war. it doesnt take much extrapolation though for this to harken to today's polical climate where terrorism is in the foreground. fans of graphic novels should pick this one up. it'll keep you busy for awhile.
076790592X|3.0|the story is very good a must read.... the shipping was quick but not in the described condition....
B001CD6FKS|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I expected it to be kind of lame and what I found was an entertaining plotline, excellent graphics which look phenomenal on blu-ray and and overall enjoyable movie. I never saw any of the speed racer cartoons or anything so I don't have a comparison to note but as a stand-alone, this movie is great and highly reccommended if you want to look at something pretty on your blu-ray player.
0792846443|5.0|Excellent movie and another example that wearing a cross on your neck doesn't make you a good person...you can see that on Law & Order a lot, too many freaks out there whose faith clouded up their minds. I guess like they say - \\"Everything in moderation\\"
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This was a great movie. Awesome story, awesome acting, great special effects and who doesn't love a superhero?! This looked great on blu-ray. I did have a small issue with the movie slowing down on my ps3 but I think i've determined that its a hardware problem on my end, not any fault of the disc itself. I would still reccommend this even with my tiny slowing down problem.
B001E75QGG|1.0|I could not believe I was watching a Spielberg/Lucas movie. Well, it goes without saying that this is the worst of all the four. The great thing about this series was that there was always a touch of reality - in this movie Spielberg loses it. But the good news is that you can predict the names of the next movies - Like Grandpa Indy and the grand wheelchair (when ford cannot walk anymore) - Old Indy and the strange marsh-mellow (when he will not have any teeth anymore). This movie is a parody of the other Indiana Jones movies and some other cheap thrillers like Mummy 2 etc.<br />prof. Jones saves himself from a nuclear blast in the heart of US using a old refrigerator (wish we could have told this to the people of Hiroshima) and comes out almost scratchless and goes for this relentless search for some skull which is stored in some dark cave with amazingly fake spider-webs.<br />then he is in search of some old dude in the jungles of Peru and the \\"bad\\" Russians keep on chasing him. (this is like the magic formula - Amazonian forest, dark caves, natives and Russians). The aimless Russians are searching for some nameless thing that they have no clue off - the storyline goes downhill very rapidly - they start shooting at each other and used more bullets than that has been used in Vietnam and nobody ever got hurt.<br />Finally inside some other dungeon other miracles happen - here is the funniest portion - there is a statue of East Indian Nataraj inside the cave of amazonian jungle - and finally everything ends with a grand ending like a bridge to nowhere. I cannot really believe I had to spend money to rent this movie - the acting is pathetic and the software effects are worst - we have been pampered by Pixar and you can really see the difference.

0375826726|1.0|Flow...what flow...this is not the original writing style that I experienced and enjoyed in the first two books.     It's almost as if the author threw in overly \\"detailed\\" descriptions to reach a certain word count which probably produced a higher payout! (The new definition of Brisingr should be 'overkill')    Definitely not a series to remember like JK Rowling's Harry Potter Series and other high brow authors. JK Rowling's writing clearly displayed an advanced thought process that is obviously missing in this final volume that I was hoping to see /experience as the author has matured since his first book.     I wish I could purchase a more \\"concise\\" version.     I feel insulted while reading this book...as if my imagination is incapable of envisioning what Saphira must look like as she lands on the ground to meet Eragon among many other scenes that are ridiculously expanded. All of the hot air is giving me a headache...     If you need to buy it to satisfy your curiosity...then buy it on sale or wait for the paperback version.     Needless to say I am extremely disappointed... and I've already read various versions of this story before...nothing original here.
B00005JPO1|2.0|I gave this movie 2 stars, but I believe it deserves only one.  I'll give Harrison Ford a star for actually taking part in it.  But it's inane and almost sad when you think of how great the other movies were --- the jokes are bad --- the direction, the writing and the actors simply suck... and Ford should have stopped at the 3 --- God bless him for doing this one --- but it's too much --- i could not get over watching Indiana Jones at 65 --- and Shia LaBoeuf was stupid --- the whole thing was a waste of money...
B0017VG69U|5.0|The discs themselves are in great condition. The box however was broken so doesn't work as expected.
B00005JPO1|4.0|In the year 1957, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has been captured by a group of KGB agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and taken to Area 51 in the Nevada desert to find one particular box in a warehouse full of government secrets.  While that box does fall into enemy hands, Indiana does manage to escape.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are the days of the Red Scare, and the fact that the Soviets now have that box means Indiana is now on a government watch list.  Just as this is making things hard on his day job as a professor, Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) finds Indiana.  Mutt quickly tells him that Indiana's old college friend Ox (John Hurt) has been captured and needs Indiana's help.  So it's off to South America on the trail of the fabled City of Gold and the crystal skull necessary to open it.  Irina is only one step behind Indy, however.  Can Indy figure out Ox's notes and rescue his friend while staying one step ahead of the Soviets?<br /><br />I never watched the Indiana Jones movies until I hit college, watching the second one earlier this year for the first time.  I think that helped my perspective.  While I enjoyed the movies, I was able to see (and overlook) their flaws.<br /><br />And that's what you have to do here, too.  Yes, there were some slow parts, but there was still plenty of action and humor.  And I loved those blink and you miss them references to the earlier films.  The emphasis here is on stunts and action, keeping the special effects to a minimum until the climax.  What special effects we did get did show how far we've come in the last 20 years.  The acting was great, especially Cate Blanchett who managed to steal some of her scenes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the biggest moments of the film was spoiled early.  It was still great, but it would have been so much better as a surprise.<br /><br />The only real problem I have with the film is the climax, which was pretty out there.  And considering the original films, that's saying something.  I've mellowed a little over time, so it's not quite the disaster it once was in my eyes.<br /><br />On the whole, I'll be able to accept where they went with the ending and enjoy the film for what it is, an escapist action movie that entertains.  This isn't serious movie making, but Indiana never has been.  This is definitely a movie to consider the next time you want some escapist action.ver time, so it's not quite the disaster it once was in my eyes.

0132350882|4.0|Clean Code is a good book for learning or reaffirming the fundamentals of writing efficient, object oriented code that is easy to read and easy to maintain.    The thing that I liked the most about the book was that I could get through it in a 2 hour sitting. The Table of Contents is well organized and all chapters conform to a common format. There are multiple contributors to the work. Thus, working off a common format unifies the book and avoids the pitfall of a disjointed read which is a risk when publishing a book that has content from different authors.    The chapters present topics progressively. In the beginning you start out with the topics that are general to all programmers-- proper naming, how to write well formatted code with competent commenting, how to write a well encapsulated function, etc...    Eventually the book presents \\"bigger picture\\" concepts--favoring the use of exceptions, embracing test driven development and best practices with regard to object design, for example.    There's a lot of code in the book. So, examples are not lacking. That the code examples are in Java limits the readership, as does using JUnit as the background against which testing concepts are presented. There are a lot of .NET programmers out there that could benefit from the book, but might feel a bit ignored due to the Java bias. The same can be said about developers using other testing frameworks such as Nunit, MBUnit and TestNG.    The bottom line on this book is that you can use it immediately and quickly. The book shines when sticking to general, conceptual topics. It's the perfect gift that a senior developer can give to the any emerging developer on his or her team and expect to see significantly improved work almost immediately.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is a reminder how it was not so good in the \\"good old days\\".  Alcohol was the drug of choice.  Women were servants without brains.  Men wanted all the freedom and none of the consequences.  Cynical manipulation was ramping up.  In some ways, much has changed.  And in some ways, nothing has changed.    The production values are incredible and the characters are irresistible.  You never know what gem will show up next.  Would you scold a child with a plastic bag over her head for leaving the cleaning on the floor instead of grabbing the bag off her?
0553582038|4.0|it's late 2008 now; seems GRRM is pre-occupied with other ventures, projects, blogs and ego-inflating $$ endeavors. He has time for a lot of artist appearances, travels, but not for writing. Hopefully he gets his plots and priorities figured out and back on track. We're patiently waiting, but the patience is beginning to wear thin.  When Book four came out, it was divulged that half of the POV chapters were cut out of the book in order to make it a more \\"manageable\\" size; the cut POV chapters were to be used in book 5. So if book 5 was half-complete three years ago, what's the hold-up?  Reviewer's Update, Dec. 2009 - it's now very late 2009, over a year after the first review - and the situation is the same. GRRM is still pre-occupied with other ventures, such as playing editor for other books and authors, globe-trotting to check out the making of his books into an HBO series, going to Game Cons, etc, etc ,etc. He'll blog maybe once every four months with a book update saying he's chugging away at the 5th book, but it's pretty obvious he's lost interest in this project. His prerogative, as author of course, but it's also our prerogative as fans and consumers to complain about it if we see fit to do so. So a warning, if you are just getting into this series, BEWARE - the series is far from completion, looks like it won't be completed for at least another 3-4 books, and GRRM writes these books at a pace of about 1 every 5-6 years. So be prepared to be patient.  Reviewer's Update, Dec. 2011 - The HBO series has quite a following, lots of rabid fans. Is it any good? I wouldn't know. After reading book 4, hating the direction the series was going, and having to wait, what 6+ years for book 5 (bite me Neil Gaiman, I'm one of the millions paying the authors bills, I have the right to complain), I decided to veto both the TV series and any future books until I hear from the patient fans whether GRRM deserves my money. According to an avalanche of readers here on Amazon andelsewhere, it looks like book 5 is more of the same drivel as book 4. I will continue to wait. Books 1-3 were that good, I will wait. And a note for Bantam management - is Editor Anne Groell really the right person to reign in GRRM? I'm sure anyone reading this has seen it ALL before on other reviewers' comments. My one hope is that GRRM, Bantam mngmt, are noticing the poor reviews, and hopefully something will be done about the very real potential of having this once incredible series spiral irrevocably out of control. Damage control NOW, please. I would rather wait an additional 5 years per book for someone to tell GRRM to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch and do it right this time, rather than see this story and rich, incredible world go down in flames. Or fire GRRM from his own series and have Sanderson write it.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|the songs are good, but the production is terrible.  everything's mixed high and compressed to death, so even on my headphones it sounds like it's being played on cheap car speakers, like it's coming in over the radio.  probably fine with the windows down and the volume way up, trunk rattling, but nothing you want to hear clearly.  the drums are better than \\"st anger\\", but it's still tough to listen to.  a good system would choke on this sound.<br /><br />rubin's smashed production aside, the songs are good.  people have compared it to \\"master of puppets\\" and \\"ride the lightning\\", but i think it's more like the faster pieces on the black album.  it's no speed metal classic, and it's definitely more personal than 'the thing that should not be'.<br /><br />i give the songs 4 stars, because they're better than anything since \\"metallica\\", but i give the production 2 stars because it's almost as bad as \\"ride the lightning\\".  fans, and metallica fans have persevered like few others, deserve better than this.
B0015FML06|3.0|I've been eagerly awaiting a deluxe reissue of this album for years.  THis is the best of U2 live really.  Joshua Tree (recorded later) is still their peak, but as a live act, this has U2 as their most exciting, back when their political idealologies were blossoming, but just before Bono took his \\"I'm the greatest politician in the world and I'm also a fabulously cocky rock star\\" that he's been hell bent on the past 20 years....I love U2 (well not their last 2 releases so much that are a bit too bland for me, but their history: War, Joshua Tree, Under a Blood Red Sky, Zooropa, Achtung Baby, and many other great songs in the other albums.....even Pop has 4-5 absolute classics and for all its missteps had all the experimentation excitement, even though it sounds more dated than Boy today....    Under a Blood Red Sky though is just fabulous, the live cd, and the footage I've seeon over the years on TV.....    I was ready to buy this deluxe edition right away (I still probably will) but am VERY DISAPPOINTED to see that the full DVD concert is not on CD.  The CD is just a remastered version of the old, short cd that's been on the market for years.  THE enclosed DVD will be great and will cause me to buy this likely in the next 2 months when I get around to it, but while I'm excited/eager to own the DVD in my music DVD collection, I'll probably only watch it once or twice a year....but I do have much more time to listen to the CD, and unfortunately it's the same CD I've owned for years with just remastered sound.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm excited about the remastered sound on this classic live record, but I've always wanted more U2 live from this era, and it seems that they are selling fans short by not putting allt he music on the DVD on the accompanying CD....    A real shame.    Overall:  GREAT MUSIC, great live record.  U2 Live at their absolute peak.  THe songwriting got better later, but they were never better performers than they were at this stage.  Just a lotof fun, what live albums should be, but the CD is and always has been a bit too short really to make a list of the ten best live albums ever made (which is a shame because the songs on here are classic and if it was extended it definately could rank in that category).    The parts of the live dvd I've seen in the past are phenomenal.  This was a real moment for U2 and for the 80's rock scene (I'm a child of the 80's and a high schooler of the 90's and this album and it's live shots have been played on TV quite a bit over the years and it's spellbounding).....I've seen U2 live in the early 2000's and have watched Rattle and Hum and Own the Zoo TV Live in Australia DVD, and I can say still that Under a Blood Red Sky is them at their most exciting that I've seen....    The negatives: why not put all the music that's on the DVD on the CD?  The CD has always been very short, which has always brought this great live album down to reality.  This was the opportunity, and this album has been one of those \\"I really really really can't wait until they expand it\\" albums for years.  This was a real lost opportunity.    Overall, the music's great.  The DVD will be a must have, but it's not a 5 star collection, because they jipped us on the cd portion, and that's the portion I personally would listen to the most.
B000ERU5EK|5.0|Blast from the past with lyrics of The Who \\"Rain down on Me.....\\".  Great refreshing dance trance crisp vocal, on a rainy day or any other.  Really nice listening.
B0016NF06O|4.0|This is a CD you have to work to love.  Not that it isn't worth loving.  It is.  Marsalis plays the trumpet sparingly and with a kind of precision that can sound as much like soul as the blues.  Nelson matches the trumpet with his voice--he isn't trying too hard, he's not laying off because of his age, he's entering the song when he has to, when he should, and offering his voice as one of the instruments.  It's hard not to like both of these guys.  The backing, though, is not something I enjoy.  When Marsalis is comped by the saxophonist, I find it annoying.  The piano is tinny.  I sort of wish they had Marsalis, Nelso, a trumpet, a guitar, a set of drums, and that's it.  Caldonia is my favorite on the whole album.  It's a kind of set-your-feet-back and think of times when New Orleans wasn't forsaken tune.  Make no mistake, there is mourning here.  That's what drives the blues of this album.  It is of a piece with NOLA by Connick and other albums from those who call that unfairly besmirched city home.  Thanks for this album, guys.  I hope it motivates people to do right by others.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I'm supposed to criticize movies, but there is so much AWESOMENESS about this one that I won't even bother!!  If you love incredible things like   Christmas Excitement and Baby Deer and Love and Life and even some wonder and fantasy, then this movie needs to be on the top of your list!  I rented it, then bought it as fast as I could find a copy.  I especially liked the train ride scene where the Dancer/Chefs exited the kitchen galley area and served the children Hot Chocolate!!  Absolutely amazing.  See this movie with someone you truly love...  Cheers ---
B00000DCHD|5.0|This album, along with The Stranger, is, in my opinion, Billy Joel's best work. When I first purchased the album in the 70s, I was in high school and liked it because it was &#34;New York&#34; music. My favorites are the beautiful &#34;Until the Night&#34;, and &#34;Rosalinda's Eyes&#34;.  If you are a fan of Billy Joel, or if you just like well composed music, you should own this.
032147404X|4.0|Lots of good information here.  Had the author not insisted on trying to be funny throughout most of the book I would have given it 5 stars.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I bought Keane's first two albums and enjoyed them very much. They were similar to Coldplay I thought, yet I definitely could recognize and enjoy Keane's style a lot more. Lead singer Tom Chaplin's voice has always remained distinct and skillful in my view.    With the British band's new album, Perfect Symmetry, Keane has changed much of their overall sound. I have read some reviews here already that criticize this. I do not have a problem with the change at all. Keane has managed to update their sounds yet still be reminiscent of the past, the 1980's to be exact. Synthesizers run rampant throughout the CD, with the track \\"Again and Again\\" coming quickly to mind. The intro of the song definitely reminds me of some songs I love from the 80's.    The lyrics of the songs are thoughtful, yet I must admit the constant rhyming of almost every line can be annoying at times. But it still does not take away the overall enjoyment I had from listening to \\"Perfect Symmetry.\\"    Yes, you will not enjoy this album if all you can think about is Keane's previous style in the first two albums. But if you can give it a chance, you'll quickly realize that this style still exists but with new and much appreciated aspects as well. Keane has always held a special place in my rank of favorite artists, and \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" only reinforces this. I highly recommend their new album.    Highlights:  Spiralling - The first single, the song has a strange yet catchy intro.  Perfect Symmetry - A piano-infused song, it is very melodic and flowing.  Again and Again - I love the intro, and the rest of the song is just as great.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|Let me state right off, True Blood is very addicting, HBO has a way of creating these series that hook you.  The Louisiana setting is perfect, what other state so lends itself to spookiness and the occult more than sultry Louisiana.  Really the state is a character, in and of itself, actually probably the most important of the series.  I have to agree with another review that the theme music is not the best, which is so unusual for an HBO series, think of how perfect the music was for Six Feet Under and the Sapranos, I would have perfered if they had used Lynyrd Skynyrds That Smell..like they did at the end of one episode, not that would have fit perfect..anyway, this series, well the few episodes that have aired, have been very good, not great, but I have faith this will be a typical great HBO series..One really annoying thing about the show is how the accents are all over the place, look ive spent time in southern louisana and everybody talks the same, I mean in True Blood, one guy sounds like he lives in the bayou, one girl sounds like she's from deep woods 'Bama, one dude sounds like he's from South Carolina, ..you get the picture, I mean how hard would it have been to have gone down to like New Iberia and sampled the accents and mimiced them, the southern Louisiana accent is very endearing, and that hard to grasp, ask Dennis Quaid...so get it right.  I really like the chemistry between Sookie and Bill, it's very hot and I agree Sam is very creepy, if I were Sookie it would be no contest between the two, even if Bill is part of the undead..i mean he's hot right?..I was sad..spoiler alert!!.that the killed of the grandmother, I always like that actress, she does those roles so well.  Last but certainly not least the actor that plays Jason, is straight up HOT!!,  and his character is so pivotal he needs to be, I've not read the books this series is based on so I leave it to the readers of the series to form an opinion on whether this series thus far is true to thebook, but book or no book, this series rocks..and for the record I plan to go out and buy the books this weekend and get started reading them.

B000GG4Y3M|5.0|\\"Black Rain\\" provides a showcase for the directorial and cinematographic brilliance of Ridley Scott - whose love for the evocative nature of wet and shining surfaces owes more to Monet than to the fetishistic excesses of a photographer such as Helmut Newton.  Gritty, wonderful \\"New York Cop\\" performance by Michael Douglas, matched by his partner Andy Garcia, with a perfect Japanese counterpart in Detective Masahira Masimoto of the Osaka Prefecture Police Department, played by Ken Takakura.  Very nicely done cross-cultural references to the Japanese sense of group identity and loyalty, contrasted to the American ethos of \\"radical 'Cowboy' individualism.\\"  Lovely score by Hans Zimmer, looking forward to his work in \\"The Last Samurai.\\"
B0011HF6GE|5.0|My title pretty much sums this album up...it sounds like a cross between Mark Hollis' voice (Talk Talk)and the music of Iron and Wine.  Very nice mixture indeed...Perhaps, just a slight bit more experimentation than Iron and Wine, a synth wash here and an odd, distant pulsing sound there, but overall, a very nice, introspective album that fans of acoustic-based, experimental-folk music should appreciate.  While nowhere near as grand in scope, there are moments on this disc that bring to mind Talk Talk's Spirit of Eden.  And that, my friends, is a very good thing indeed...
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Ive listened to enough little girls 'singing from their diaries' as Teddy Thompson has put it...and this...well. Its so radically different it's almost as if using the word music for both of them would seem a disservice to lamontagne.    Each album ive taken on it's own merits, and not sought to compare to each other. His songwriting remains brutally honest, warm and intense on this third album. I don't particularly care who he channels, because one day...in years to come...someone will channel him.    It's the kind of music that makes you want to put your headphones on and pretend the music is too loud to hear  any  thing  else.    And sing alone in the dark as if there's not another soul around.    As close to perfect as a voice has come.    That is all.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am so addicted to this show!  Everyday on my lunch break I scour the internet looking for articles, photos, blogs etc. related to this show.  The characters are so fleshed out, I find that I cannot wait to see how the story will continue each week.    I just bought the first Charlaine Harris book last week and began reading it at chapter 6 to follow along with the show.  I couldn't wait until the next episode so I would read the next chapter of the book to get my fix.  In my opinion it is pretty close to what I have seen on screen so far. I couldn't put the book down either and have now finished it.    I am so happy to hear that the show has been renewed for another season.  I also can't wait to own the DVDs when they are available.  I was so happy to read the other reviews here because I thought I was the only one who felt this way!
B001EC9V58|3.0|I enjoyed this movie (as much as you can enjoy a gory horror flick filmed with a shaky hand-cam), but it was nowhere near the scariest movie I'd ever seen. In my book, A Tale Of Two Sisters still holds that record. I actually found most of REC to be boring, painfully predictable, and not at all scary. The last 15 minutes or so were pretty freaky, I give them that. I jumped. More than once. Which is a big deal for me. I doubt I've ever seen a creepier, chills-down-your-spine zombie, and I doubt I ever will again. But overall, this was just your average zombie flick, as others have said \\"28 Days Later\\" meets the \\"Blair Witch Project\\". I haven't seen Quarantine, so I can't compare. This is definitely worth checking out if you're a horror fan. Watch the last chapter alone in a dark room. I dare you to sleep well afterwards.
B00005K3NY|4.0|The seventies gave birth to psychokinetic horror films such as the blockbusters \\"Carrie\\" and \\"The Fury.\\"  In 1980, David Cronenberg (director of such science fiction horror classics as \\"The Brood,\\" \\"Rabid,\\" and \\"The Fly\\") brought us \\"Scanners.\\"<br /><br />  Scanners are humans who can read your thoughts and manipulate your actions.  Most of them are emotionally dysfunctional because the multitude of thoughts that bombard them can produce insanity.  Therefore, they live in isolation.  The drug Ephemerol is used to block thoughts.<br /><br />  Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) is a good scanner who must find and destroy an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside).  Revok is intent on creating a group of scanners that will rule the world.  This plot will be repeated numerous times in future sequels and in such horror hits as the \\"Firestarter\\" series.<br /><br />  Cameron encounters many dangerous obstacles during his quest to locate his nemesis.  There is much death and bloodshed.  Beautiful Kim Obrist (Jennifer Oneill of Lucio Fulci's \\"The Psychic\\") is another scanner who befriends Cameron.  Together, they make an adorable couple and you can't help but cheer them on in their dangerous quest.<br /><br />  Eerie music and wintry Canadian scenery provide an excellent background for this high tech chiller.  The acting is superb, the plot is fast paced, and the ending is quite shocking.  \\"Scanners\\" is a must see for fans of telekinetic horror.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|My first thought upon finishing this film was, \\"how can something so dark and gory be so beautiful?\\" And it's true, to me at least. This movie is gory and gorgeous at the same time. It draws you in starting with the (rather creative) opening credits. I usually skip through those (who doesn't?), but I didn't this time. I have no idea why people are having problem with the casting, I thought everyone in this film was wonderful. I'm not even a Burton fan, but I thought Sweeney Todd definitely delivered. My only complaint is the ending, it seemed rushed and without much closure.
B00005JM8V|5.0|SHOAH is too exhaustive a study (9 1/2 hours in length) to be considered the definitive Holocaust documentary. In 30 minutes, NIGHT AND FOG, Resnais' searing masterpiece gives us a concise picture of that awful period with images that are etched in our minds with the psychic equivalent of a branding iron. Lanzmann's effort is not about images anyway. It is about words. Words from people who lived through the nightmare. That's not to say there aren't images here that lacerate the heart of any reasonable and compassionate human being. These images however, are not of walking skeletons, or corpses piled up and tossed into mass graves, but of people reliving moments too horrible for the brain to process rationally.    Lanzmann interviews a few Jewish workers at Chelmno, who somehow miraculously escaped the fate of all their relatives and friends in the gas vans. He interviews a barber who cut the hair of people who minutes later were gassed at Treblinka. He talks to Filip Muller, one of the Sonderkommando (special detail) at Auschwitz, a Czech Jew who had to clean out the gas chambers and cremate the bodies. He also interviews a former Nazi guard at Treblinka (who doesn't know his testimony is being recorded for posterity) as well as a former high Nazi official responsible for maintaining the Warsaw ghetto prior to it's liquidation, whose failure to take any responsibility is notable. Lanzmann talks to Greek Jews who were shipped to Auschwitz and lost families. He talks to Poles who now live in homes once owned by Jews, or who lived near Treblinka and could hear screams at night. One of the most poignant interviews is with Jan Karski, a former Polish resistance fighter and liason to the government in exile, whose job it was to spread the word of the Jewish extermination to a world that basically didn't care enough to do anything to end the slaughter before the war ended in Europe. Karski gives a heartrending account of a tour through the Warsaw ghetto. Finally, Lanzmanninterviews 2 survivors of the Warsaw ghetto, resistance fighters who have the cruel memories forever etched on their faces.    SHOAH was a monumental undertaking, and it really should be used as a tool to educate young people worldwide..educate them on the depths of depravity a so called civilized society can sink to under the right conditions, and educate them on what it means to have a conscience, and live with the moral, and ethical values necessary to be considered part of the human race.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This a great box set featuring all 4 Alien movies.  I didn't care too much for Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection but this set is quite amazing.  Each movie has its original version and director's cut version as well tons of special features with a total of 9 discs.  This boxset is HUGE.  If you spread it out its like near 3 feet in length.  I actually didn't buy it off Amazon though, I got it for $20 brand new at Circuit City on sale when that God-awful Alien vs. Predator 2 Requiem movie came out on DVD.

B001FBSMW6|4.0|Listen with headphones and pay attention to the quality of this recording from vocals to music to lyrics.  It's a very solid CD.  The band has matured significantly and taking a chance on some 80's sounding tunes is a bold move for a young band, but, they pull it off.  There are plenty of songs here that are pure Keane.  I think the strongest track is Time to Go--and I hope they start their concerts off with this song and just let the crowd absorb the simplicity and the incredible voice before kicking it up a notch.  For any 'James' fans out there, you will hear similarities between Tom Chaplin and Tim Booth's voices---especially in this tune.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|This is a good movie & kept the granddaughters busy & gave us peace for a while.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|As one of Hollywood's most rememberable franchises, Indiana Jones has a strange ranking among fans compared to others like Star Wars and James Bond. Either fans are based within two categories: the ones that absolutely love it or the ones that thinks that it's just okay. I have yet to meet someone who ever dispised the series, and with good reason. Harrison Ford had and has such an appeal as the early to mid 1900's archaeologist and explorer that it became his most recognizable character, giving even more of a chance to showcase his acting chops than his work in the original Star Wars trilogy as Han Solo. The first three Jones films were shot at Ford's peak as an actor while he was still in his early forties, easily able to keep up with the films action packed scenes and storylines. But like life itself, you can't stop the passage of time, and almost 20 years later can Ford, along with mainstay producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg, be successful with a now 65 year old Indiana Jones? Could he still crack a whip and knock out the bad guys all the while not looking like someone who's just past his prime?<br /><br />Taking place 19 years since the events of the third film \\"The Last Crusade\\", Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones Jr, is still up to his old tricks. Part time college professor, part time explorer. But now the adventures are getting harder and harder. His long time mentor and friend Marcus Brody has passed and his rival father Henry Jones Sr. is gone too. Also, the world around him has changed as well. The German threat is over, and now the fears of the Russians, Cold War, and Nuclear Weaponry loom over each personal success. After a fouled up assignment to stop Russian Spys from stealing \\"extra-terrestrial\\" artifacts from a hidden Nevada goverment station, Indy finds himself on a forced leave of absence from Barnett College. While trying to leave, he runs into a young man by the name of \\"Mutt\\" Williams who has been looking for Indy to help him rescue Harold Oxley, Mutt's father figure and Indy's old friend. Oxley and Mutt's Mom (eventually found out to be none other than Raiders co-star and former flame Marion Ravenwood, again by seemingly ageless Karen Allen) have been lost while searching for a Crystal Skull within South America that as legend tells has strange powers that might not be from this planet. However the Russians, led by Cate Blanchett want this too, and will do anything to stop Indy and his gang from achieving the ultimate goal of returning the skull to it's proper resting place. Will this so-called alien artifact open a doorway into the great beyond, or is it as Indy originally thinks, just something that belongs in a museum?<br /><br />While watching this film it surprised me how the Lucas/Spielberg team were able to hold back the outrageousness of previous films to bring this one into a more realistic light, especially for it's star. Jones is older in this, and at times it shows yet being respectful and still highly entetaining. While other Indy sidekicks have provided little more than comic relief, Shia LaBeouf's Mutt picks up the slack where Jones shouldn't be able to provide at this point in his life. Don't get me wrong, Indy still will whip your butt, but it's just not as easy as it once was nor should it be. Another classy move is how the first three films reflected the memories of 1940's action adventure films, this chapter moves properly ahead to the 1950's Cold War era with it's Atom Bomb testing and the threat of Russian dominance & communism. Honestly cast-wise there's not one weak link here, everybody does a great job and keep this 2 hour & 2 minute movie going without any drag or unnecessary parts. While the idea of Indiana Jones dealing with an alien-like scenerio might seem hokey, it really does fit well here, be it the film's ending might have had you expecting something a little bit different. Overall, the once heralded Lucas/Spielberg has provided another great film instead of say another Episode I thru III, all the while keeping it in it's place knowing that it could never be as good as the original nor should it be, just an extension like revisiting an old friend years after your first glory.<br /><br />The Single-Disc edition (that I'm reviewing here) has the usual fantastic picture and audio of a modern day SD-DVD release, but also comes with two 15 minute plus documentaries speaking of both the Indiana Jones legacy and how some of the shots were accomplished. Many may be awfully surprised to see how little CGI was used in this flix (even the film itself was shot on actual film, NOT digitally!), and how much effort was made to keep this within the confines of the trilogy before it. Sorry, we again get no Spielberg/Lucas commentary, but this should be considered a good thing if you ever sat through a Lucas one. So while I assume you get behind-the-scenes overkill with the 2 Disc set, those with light wallets won't get bare-boned with this version either.<br /><br />Like seeing an old friend from high school it was nice to revisit such an icon of many's theatrical past. While it isn't the Indy of old (or is that young?), he still has some life left in him for this chapter. Nice cast additions and a story that keeps you going throughout, Crystal Skull will entertain and having that theme song back in your brain for weeks to come.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)hru III, all the while keeping it in it's place knowing that it could never be as good as the original nor should it be, just an extension like revisiting an old friend years after your first glory.

B0018CWEYY|1.0|i dont know what people are thinking when they say this show is good.   This show has sucked from the beginning. It has no direction or plan for the season when you watch it through. It is obvious they are making it up from week to week. I watched the show on and off from the first season to now, they have completely changed the 'rules' of the show from start to now. From the 'security system' to 'the others' and so on.  Its a shame as what jj abrams did with alias was masterful. Alias is one the best shows goin around. It has depth, a goal, great characters, and powerful story lines, and substance thats believable . This is why i gave lost a chance. You would never guess its made by the same guy. It sucks big time.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Having purchased a Kindle, I became interested in and downloaded the entire \\"Southern Vampire\\" series by Charlaine Harris, which prompted Amazon to suggest the Twilight Saga among other contemporary offerings.  I was completely unaware of the groundswell of popularity surrounding this series when I downloaded all four books.  I'm not a romance reader, but I gotta say that some of the passages got me pretty tearful.  As an adult nearly two generations removed from the target reading audience, I'm astonished that finally an author has found a way to touch the hearts and souls of today's youth, both male and female. The fact that the marketing of the movie seems entirely aimed at the 13-20 crowd disurbs me somewhat, because this is a story all ages can appreciate and I fear many older individuals will forego the experience.  In these books, the themes of adolescent awkwardness, family relations, friendships, courage, loyalty, love, and the question of chastity are all unblinkingly addressed by the author.  Parents of this age group need to dial into this story.  The popularity of the series tells me that today's youth are a lot more romantic than I would have thought.  On Stephenie's website a draft of Midnight Sun is available, telling the story from Edward's point of view.  It's a wonderful counter-melody to the story as told from Bella's point of view.  I was able to download it to my Kindle as a .pdf file, and hope for more of the story as told by Edward.  I'm not sure I can sit in a theater with several hundred fluttering adolescent hearts, but I'm looking forward to the movie.
1596434252|5.0|ABC3D is not a children's book, and I think its author and publisher already know that. It's a sly, elegant aesthetic foray into the tactile pleasures of the alphabet, ringing changes and revealing relationships within our diverse community of letters.

B001E75QH0|5.0|Okay, I believe we all know who Indiana Jones, is, right? I grew up with Indy and my kids will be the same. This new box-set is the definitive Indy box-set. This set features the original classic trilogy plus the newest addition, \\"The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\". Just like the set that came out in May for the 4th movie, this set comes with the new special editions of the original 3 movies. The best part about this set is that the 4th movie is the 2-Disc special edition and not the lame 1-disc version. My only complaints with this set are 1) that the DVD cases are those really lame slim cases and not regular sized DVD cases and 2) the bonus disc from the original trilogy boxset is missing (although the special features makeup for that is most respects) and 3) while the cover is cool, the order of each movie cover is weird; you start from the top right and work your way around. All in all, this is the best Indy box-set out there and it's worth getting. Here's my ratings for each movie:<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark: 5/5<br />The Temple of Doom: 4/5<br />The Last Crusade: 5/5<br />The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull: 3.5/5

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love this show. The acting is good, but the script and story are amazing!  It is a bit gruesome, that never bothered me.
0375826726|3.0|This is a slightly better written book than Eldest, however the prose has not been curtailed. Yet the overly verbose and overly elaborate descriptive language of Eldest is toned down here.    Once again, this is a very political story. For a fantasy novel that can be strange. The oaths that Eragon took are highly important here. One thing that is annoying is that Paolini imparts too much preaching to the reader, albeit indirectly. One example is when he offers an insight on how there should be a balance from abstaining from meat completely and moderation. Does that really need to be in the novel I ask?? In terms of characterization, Eragon has grown to be more introspective. This attitude has given him an independent streak that is more pronounced than before. I will not say how, but he does close off from Saphira at least once. But they are as close as ever and it seems that missing each other seems to draw them closer.    I also felt that Roran's appeal continued to grow. He is likable and much more down to earth. Easier to relate to than Eragon. Many might complain this story was wasted space. I disagree. The ending is satisfying, for it is clear Paolini is setting up the ending, and therefore did not give us the complete puzzle. The secret to defeating Galboratorix is explained, we shall see how it actually happens in four.

B000DWMN2S|2.0|I found the film to be very disjointed.  Before I inserted the disc into my player I read the description on the box and some online reviews.  They make much of a young man's search for an old woman who knew his grandfather during the Holocaust sixty years ago.  Then I started the movie, and I was confused by the use of hiphop music by Alex, the tour guide.      Don't get me wrong.  I like Dr. Dre and other rappers, and I like learning about the Holocaust.  But Alex's shtick felt very forced.  The protagonist Jonathan's positive reaction to Alex's shtick made Jonathan seem phony and obsequious, as if he were saying, \\"I have to play along with hiphop in order to please these young people, and I have to play along with other more somber people in order to please my grandfather and his generation.\\"   That sounds like the attitude of a Bar Mitzvah boy with ambitions of making big bucks at his father's moneylending firm and he tells each party guest what he/she wants to hear.    I won't spoil the end of this film.  I will say the grandfather's final scene also felt forced and out of synch with what he had said and done throughout the movie.  By contrast, the character of Maude in \\"Harold and Maude\\" is a Holocaust survivor, and I felt her final scene was in synch with everything else.  She doesn't want to live past her 80th birthday, and she says that in the beginning.  Granted, \\"Harold and Maude\\" is not really about the Holocaust, but there are literally hundreds of other movies and TV documentaries that are indeed about it, and they are all superior to \\"Everything Is Illuminated.\\"  Some of them were even made during the Vietnam War, such as \\"The Garden of the Finzi-Continis\\" and a color film from as far back as 1967 starring Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi:  \\"The 25th Hour.\\"    I hate to denigrate something that Liev Schreiber put so much work into.  He's a terrific actor.  I loved him in \\"Kate and Leopold,\\" and I saw him do Shakespeare in a New York theater.  But he mustchoose better material to direct.  Maybe I should read the book of \\"Everything Is Illuminated.\\"  Some books just don't translate to the screen.  No matter what I may find in the book, I just cannot stomach this movie. I recommend the other three Holocaust films I named above.  They are all easily available.
0143038583|5.0|I have been reading a lot about food and nutrition and was really fastinated with the information in this book.  It is a fun read but I was kind of worried that it might be sort of one-sided politically (many on the subject seem a bit one-sided and you wonder if you are getting the full story).  The book seems refreshingly objective and dispassionate to me as far as the imformation about food, etc.  It was made more interesting by Michael explaining his own person journey of discovery and his thoughts, feelings and self-examinations along the way.  Get your older kids to read this book and they will never look at a McDonald's meal the same way again!
B0018S6YO4|4.0|its actually very good upbeat with some slow songs. i like it it's very danceable which is good too.
031606792X|5.0|I've just finished the whole series.  And I'm reading the negative reviews and just not getting it.  The books ALL of them were great!!  I'm a Jacob fan all the way.  I just loved him from the very beginning.  I love Edward and knew that they would wind up together.  I'm just glad that Jacob imprinted.  He deserves to be happy.      I think that Stephanie Meyers is a terrific author and I hope that she continues with the series.  It would be nice to catch up with everyone when Nessie and Jacob start their romance.  I think that would be a great read.  A half human/vampire and a half warewolf get together...  HMMMMMM
B001DSNEJM|4.0|A trip of a film...I thought about how to title this film the whole time I was watching it...the best I could come up with is; What a Trip..a truly psychological ride of (in the end) an anti-smoking film.<br /><br />Films like these can be debated for a long time as to when reality blurs into fiction and if the film actually ever occurs at certain points. I saw this as an approachable film with little recognition that can be attained by the masses. Bob Gunton. Piper Perabo and Brooklynn Proulx all perform in a film that I fear will be forgotten in the mass of subpar indie films coming out this quarter.<br /><br />Nothing should be explained much beyond a man experiencing a strange life of getting second chances, numerology, psychiatric misappropriation, innocent family love, and a beautiful filming location character of Canada. This is the second film in as many days (coming out this week) that shows what a splendor our Northern neighbor has.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the score, content and sublime symbolism that permeates this piece. Many critics have afforded their worthless opinions of how this film failed because of PW, but I would say give this film a chance and maybe you will be entertained by a solid psychological thriller worth watching more than once. Two deleted scenes are included to add some character content, but nothing else to speak of for the DVD. The film quality is good, and between this and Bobby Z, PW has proven he has range.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love watching this show on Monday and I am glad that it is available on DVD and I can watch it anytime that I want.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|I wish I could explain eloquently how changed I am about an opinion on a film. Watching the BD is experiencing an entirely different and much better movie.<br /><br />Technically, this is a 5 star product. I played it both on plasmas and LCDs over the last few days and it looks excellent. Paused well over 50 different scenes (motion and still scenes) and everything looks as it should for what they were trying to create. The filmmakers held an exclusive BD screening to show off their special effects and their pride in how the fx came across, so the resulting look is reasonably solid. The usual Universal menus and selection sounds are throughout, and all of the typical BD features are enabled/possible here.<br /><br />The resounding difference here are the deleted scenes. There are over 42 minutes of all the best parts left for us to interject back into the film. The reason I did not give this a 5 star is they should have made the choice to have the BD be the 2 hour 35 minute cut. The majority of every gripe I have heard about this film is answered or fixed with these scenes. Christina Cabot (Major), Ty Burrel (psych boyfriend), and Peter Mensah (the other General) all had their characters ripped to shreds with this theatrical cut. There was actually a good side to Roth, there was actually tons of character development; all apparently cut (in my opinion) to dumb down the film. What a waste.<br /><br />Be sure to have your speakers adjusted correctly because this sound mix can blow a sub or mids if you have them set to high. Great sounds, great clarity and plenty of features. Highly recommend as a purchase, and the only shortcoming is on the director for giving a 3 second intro to the deleted scenes that stated nothing of why he destroyed this film by cutting them.
B000WEMH3C|3.0|I think we had this cover one or two years.  We live in a hot climate, and after a little while, the plastic does deteriorate.

The film looks sharp in Blu-ray's 1080p resolution, even in the sepia tones shot for some of the scenes.<br /> This Blu-ray disc (as does the two-disc collectors edition on standard Dvd) also has several worthwhile extras to add to the viewers' enjoyment, including featurettes on the real Butch and Sundance, as well as the Director's commentary.<br /> All in all, a fun film, well worth getting on Blu-ray.

1416594884|3.0|I can't begin this review without saying that I have long considered John Le Carre my favorite write.  I've read all his books - most of them several time - and have felt proud to proclaim myself his greatest fan.  All of which makes writing my review for \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" both difficult and painful.     The book is a love letter to the Muslim community, sickeningly considerate of their views, while cursorily dismissive of \\"the West\\" (Britain, Germany, and the big bad wolf, America) and its legitimate security concerns. The writing is fantastic - when isn't it?  the man is a literary genius!! - but at the same time, disgustingly contrived. Worst of all, he commits the cardinal sin: the story is a bore.       For a while now, Le Carre has moved away from a gimlet-eyed recounting of espionage's moral castaways and chosen to mount the soapbox of political indignation. If Jerry Westerby and Alec Leamas and Jonathan Pine were punished for their last minute conversions to decency, at least Le Carre offered an even handed view of the stakes involved and drew complex, engaging portrait of all combatants.  I, for one, usually agreed with Smiley's plans - even if they went awry.  Maybe I'm just a believer in old fashioned REAL POLITIK, but one man's life is often worth the achievement or advancement of a country's security objectives.     (Am I wrong or was it not worth Leamas' life to get the German double agent Mundt into Directorate of East German Intelligence?  And by the way, Leamas killed himself by choosing to go back for the girl, as did Jerry Westerby by trying to save the villain Ko.  So much for the past....onto A Most Wanted Man.)       First, there is the silly, shoestring of a story.  A downcast Muslim immigrant steals into Hamburg hoping to secure money left for him in a private bank by his (villainous)father, a Russian colonel named Karpov.  The money is to be used to fund his medical education.  The Muslim's name is Issa - or \\"Jesus,\\" - but he is the most unsympathetic, boorish savior that ever was. Issa attracts the attention of another cardboard character, the untiring do-gooder, Annabelle Richter.  Just thinking of her heartfelt paeans to justice in this book makes me want to vomit.  If there really are advocates like her in this world, I've never met one...and I pray I never do. Nothing matters to her but the poor wretches she has devoted her life to save. She only drinks water and dresses like a man. Cue: swelling violins.  Cut to her flared nostrils as she fights the good fight.      Then there is Tommy Brue, a character Le Carre has written so many times he feels as shopworn as a Salvation Army overcoat.  Brue is a fourth generation banker living on the vestiges of his family's succcess while lamenting the business practices which made all of them wealthy.  He is another vile, phony creation.  In Le Carre's world, the noble must be failures, drunks, tormented homosexuals,discarded sons, or all of the above. In \\"MWM,\\" Brue is disgusted by his late father's coddling of certain Russian criminals - mostly former KGB types who made off with their country's patrimony in the murky final days of the Evil Empire - and is anxious to right his Daddy's wrongs.  (Boy, it's tough to be sixty, handsome, healthy and wealthy.  You've got to do something with your life!!  Spare me!)     In walks Issa and his problems are solved.  Here's MY problem: I didn't buy this for a second.  In a tortuously long scene, Brue interrogates Issa and decides to come to his aid. Brue is literally overcome by the muslim community's nobility, their \\"grace under poverty.\\" A more saintly bunch you've never seen.  It is as if Le Carre has smoked some kind of \\"love opium\\" that makes him see every Muslim under the sun through rose colored glasses.  Worse, Brue's motives seem as much to get into Annabelle Richter's pants as to help the poor Muslim.  Make up your mind, Mr. Le Carre.  Which is it? Sex or salvation?    Anyway, there is also German intelligence involved - they see Issa as a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Time to put him on the unscheduled flight to the secret detention facilities in Romania...you get the drift.      Where will our moral crusaders end up?  Take a guess.  In Le Carre's world, the noble always fail and the greedy Western capitalists succeed.  He has lost all nuance, all shading. It is one long, painful rant. Reading this book, I felt like I were at Marble Arch, listening to some loud mouthed, pretentious jerk lecture me for hours on end.  ZZZZzzzzz!!!    John Le Carre has lost his touch.  (Sorry, David!)

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'm not a big sci-fi fan, and I never watched the TV show upon which this movie was based. A good friend twisted my arm--almost physically--and convinced me to give this movie a chance. I finally popped in the DVD yesterday and...Wow!<br /><br />\\"Serenity\\" is what so many other movies try to be. It's clever, campy, witty, fun, thrilling, while also throwing in tidbits of social and religious commentary. From universe-shaking conspiracies, to clairvoyance, to good old swashbuckling adventure, this is an entertaining movie. The plot's been told enough times here, but suffice it to say that imagination runs high and the characters each have their own distinct personalities and purposes. This is storytelling in all its wild-eyed, woolly-haired fun, and I'm sorry I didn't jump on board \\"Serenity\\" sooner.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|As another reviewed correctly pointed out, these movies shouldn't be used to show the clarity of your Blu-ray player.  That being said, the restored versions of Godfather and Godfather II are outstanding.  I noticed a remarkable difference in the picture compared to the standard DVDs.  The biggest difference I noticed was the subtlety of the lighting throughout both movies. The sound has also been greatly enhanced.  You're able to hear a lot of background sound that previously was muttled.  Ten years ago I had the priviledge of seeing both movies at a movie theater - first time for me.  The restored versions in Blu-ray are just as impressive.  For all fans of the Godfather films, this set is a must have addition to your collection.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Loosely based upon the dark comic book and graphic novel series published by [[ASIN:0756641195 DC Comics]]/[[ASIN:0756641225 Vertigo]], Constantine is a supernatural thriller with amazing visual effects, thrilling action, and a great cast. Unfortunately, the film's screenplay, which was written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, fails to capture the spirit of the books. Rather than keeping the characters as they are in the books, the writers have taken liberties that minimalize the effect of the story. In the books, John Constantine is a blond-haired British anti-hero. Here he's played by Keanu Reeves, with black hair and an American accent. Normally I wouldn't complain about such trivial details, but the character of Constantine is further changed from his comic book counterpart. This brings me to one of the film's greatest strengths; it's original and unafraid to make changes. Breaking away from many of the conventions found in the \\"superhero\\" genre, Constantine dares to be somber and politically incorrect. Can you name any other \\"comic book\\" film where the hero has cancer, is suicidal, and generally disliked by everyone that he associates with? Nope, I didn't think so.    Demon hunter and exorcist, John Constantine has never been a popular guy, but his talents are in high demand. Constantine has the ability to see damned spirits and the knowledge necessary to send them back to Hell. The only problem is that he's a chain-smoking, cynical, selfish S.O.B. and he's just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. When Constantine is contacted by detective Angela Dodson to investigate the apparent suicide of her twin sister, Constantine discovers a demonic conspiracy to bring about the apocalypse. Relying on a small group of demon hunters, occultists, and half-breeds (a term for Earth-bound angels and demons), Constantine wages a war against the Devil. But it's only a matter of time before his cancer overpowers him and the sins of his past decide his fate in the afterlife. Will John Constantine be sent to Hell for his misdeeds, or will the gates of Heaven part for this proud and defiant sinner? In the battle between two worlds, between Heaven and Hell, between all that's good and all that's evil, between the holy and the profane... John Constantine fights for the middle ground.    The big budget action/thriller features an atypical cast, which with the exception of odd man out Keanu Reeves, fits the film's anarchic atmosphere perfectly. Though Keanu gives a fine performance, his looks and his mannerisms never seem right for the character, who was supposedly modeled after Clint Eastwood as [[ASIN:B0015XHQTE Dirty Harry]] and Sting, the lead singer of the Police. The cast includes Rachel Weisz as Angela and Isabel Dodson, Shia LaBeouf as Chas, Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, Djimon Honsou as Papa Midnite, Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Peter Stormare as Satan. Each member of the diverse cast gives a worthy performance, but the standout here is indie film star Tilda Swinton, who plays the beatific and androgynous angel Gabriel with a delicious irony.  As has often been the case with films based upon characters created by Alan Moore, Constantine became a showcase for the latest computer effects rather than focusing on the deeply flawed characters that made the books so successful.  With the film's blasphemous overtones, it's no wonder that many religious groups were up in arms about the portrayal of Biblical figures. Still the film serves up about as much theological discussion as similarly ironic film RoboCop did for discussions about law enforcement, which is fine by me. Not every film needs to take itself so seriously and Constantine doesn't. Another flaw of the film is the direction, which feels both forced and mechanical in its execution. Directed by music video auteur Francis Lawrence, who focuses on creating a visually stunning but emotionally devoid alternate reality populated by all manner of miscreants and lost souls. If you're looking for a thought provoking film about redemption through spirituality, then Constantine will likely disappoint. But if what you seek is a fast-paced thriller with lots of action and witty dialogue, then Constantine is for you.

031606792X|5.0|This book was the perfect ending for a thrilling love story.  I've heard of the saga not so long ago.  After buying Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse in Spanish (I'm from Argentina), I couldn't wait to see how the story would finish.  So, I've pre-ordered it in Amazon and I've received it on Monday, 5th.  I have little time during the day, mostly because I work in an office for 9 hours and then I go to college.  But between my lunch hour and going back and forth from home, I could finish it very quickly.<br />I loved the way Bella and Edward 'fit'.  It's a perfect match in many ways...  The book is filled with action and twists and love and happiness.  The couple is intensified and more together than ever.  And even though it's fiction, I keep having this secret hope that one day I'll travel to the US, I'll visit Forks and I'll see them walking around, holding each other's hand looking so beautiful and so in love that 'dazzling' will be the only word left to describe them.
B000TGJ80S|3.0|Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", is a lavish, visually stunning treatment of the Dracula tale. The film features exquisite production design, startling special effects, and one of the best film scores that I've heard in a long time. But the film, which had so much potential, is deeply flawed. Altogether \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" suffers from an excessive amount of visual stimuli, which takes priority over characterization and acting. Much of the cast gives either flat, unconvincing performances or goes to the opposite end of the spectrum, overacting and projecting their own celebrity rather than the persona that they're supposed to be adopting.<br /><br />The story itself, despite what the film's title implies, is a great departure from Bram Stoker's 1897 horror novel. The screenplay by James V. Hart plucks the characters and events out of Stoker's original story, and then awkwardly attempts to create a gothic romance around them. Anyone who is truly familiar with the novel knows that romance was the furthest thing from Stoker's mind. I am of the opinion that you can tell a \\"Dracula\\" story without directly basing it upon Stoker's novel, or you can take Stoker's initial ideas and alter them for your own purposes, but you should never claim that you're following Stoker's blueprint when you do so.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The story follows young and ambitious solicitor, Jonathan Harker, as he travels to Transylvania to oversee the signing of certain papers, which have to do with the selling of ten very specific houses in London, to the mysterious and eccentric Count Dracula. Harker must leave behind the woman he loves, Mina Murray. After arriving in Transylvania, Harker is taken to Dracula's castle by a dark and ominous coach, whose driver is obscured beneath his gothic armor.<br /><br />When Harker arrives at the castle, he is greeted by the ancient Count himself. The castle is dreary and oppressive, covered with spider webs and barely lit. AsHarker and Dracula go over the details of the paperwork he is to sign, Dracula discovers a photograph of Mina, and he becomes convinced that she is his lover, Elisabeta, reincarnated. Dracula insists that Jonathan stay with him for a month, though Jonathan is anxious to return to Mina. He becomes aware that he is not a guest, but a prisoner in Dracula's castle.<br /><br />Meanwhile Mina is staying with her wealthy friend, Lucy Westenra, who is shamelessly flirtatious and uses her sex appeal to win the hearts of three suitors, Dr. Seward, Quincy P. Morris, and Arthur Holmwood.<br /><br />Back in Transylvania, Count Dracula prepares for a voyage to London as Jonathan Harker realizes that his captor is an inhuman monster capable of unspeakable evil. Once Dracula arrives in London, he seduces and feeds off of Lucy turning her into an insatiable, damned creature of the darkness. As Lucy's unusual \\"illness\\" grows in its severity, Dr. Seward calls upon the brilliant and eccentric Abraham Van Helsing to help diagnose her. At first Van Helsing is perplexed, but quickly he becomes aware that Lucy is the victim of a vampire... and Mina may be his next target.<br /><br />Soon Van Helsing, Jonathan Harker, and Lucy's three suitors must exterminate Dracula and his demonic offspring all the while Mina's mind, body, and soul hang in the balance.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Francis Ford Coppola assembled an impressive cast for the film, however none of them seem to be comfortable in their roles. Keanu Reeves plays Jonathan Harker as pompous bore, and Winona Ryder's portrayal of Mina suggests that she was never confident of her ability to produce a believable English accent. Anthony Hopkins hams it up as Professor Van Helsing, turning the beloved character into a drunken, raving madman. In fact, the only member of the cast who seems to fit his role, at least partially, is Gary Oldman as Count Dracula. However, the moment he is taken out of his \\"old man\\" makeup, he mistakenly changes Stoker's Count from a repulsive, parasitic invader into a tragic and romantic figure.<br /><br />The problem is that with any film involving the supernatural, audiences must in some way suspend disbelief, and the best way to achieve this is to ground the film in a tangible reality and to ensure that the character's story arcs are anchored by some sense of psychological realism.<br /><br />The characters go from bearing one perspective to another, which is its very contrary, giving no sign of transition from one mental state to the next and thus seeming very bipolar.<br /><br />The world that the characters in Coppola's film inhabit are is lacking any depth. Beyond the four corners of the screen it ceases to exist. We are shown exactly what the filmmaker wishes us to see, but rarely is it anything more than a magician's trick to diver our attentions from the fact that Coppola is neither a great admirer of the novel or fully aware of its allegorical context. The result is a film that looks beautiful, but is superficial to its vacuous core.<br /><br />Perhaps, the film's greatest flaw, and certainly the one which irritates \\"Dracula\\" and Stoker scholars the most, is the fact that with the title \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\", the film apparently is insinuating that this is indeed Stoker's version of the tale or at the very least that it is the definitive cinematic vision of the perennial vampire classic. Nothing could be further from the truth. Any nuance or subtlety of the novel is whisked away by the melodramatic excesses of the film's clumsy direction and acting. The thematic complexity and ambiguity of Stoker's novel is completely misplaced.<br /><br />Arguably the film's greatest strength is the magnificent score by Wojciech Kilar. This score deserves a better film.<br /><br />As the film progresses it dissolves into a kaleidoscopic menagerie of cavorting half-naked women, melodramatic romance, and some of the most gratuitous bloodletting seen in a mainstream American film. Though, I admire Coppola's tenacity as a filmmaker, this film is a missed opportunity as he dazzles us with eye candy but leaves us craving something far more substantial.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br />[[ASIN:0743498038 The Essential Dracula]] by Bram Stoker, edited by Leonard Wolf<br />[[ASIN:B000VUQ4HW Nosferatu- Eine Symphonie des Grauens]]<br />[[ASIN:B000GPIPSS Dracula]]<br />[[ASIN:B00006G8K0 Horror of Dracula]]<br />[[ASIN:B000R7I48G Count Dracula]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005YJMX Nosferatu: The Vampyre / Phantom Der Nacht]]<br />[[ASIN:B0001ZX0O2 Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]<br />[[ASIN:B0007ACVKU Bram Stoker's Dracula and Other Film Music by Wojciech Kilar]]
B0015FML06|4.0|Finally on DVD, one of the great rock shows ever!<br /><br />I wasn't at the well-known Concert at Red Rocks, where U2 played on June 5, 1983, which was, coincidentally, my 23rd birthday.<br /><br />I was at the show about a week later, in Dallas, where U2 played to an UNsold-out 1200 seat theater, located inside -- get this -- a bowling alley. (Dallas had a really small \\"underground\\" rock scene then, and I saw REM, The Pretenders, and even Talking Heads at this unlikely venue. \\"The Bronco Bowl\\" was small and intimate and had great sound). The Irish Rockers had never been to Dallas, and had never even had any commercial radio-play there. If you were a North Texan who didn't have MTV, and a lot of people didn't, it was very likely that you'd still never have heard of U2 at all. Not me, though! Having recently been in college in Rochester, NY, I was very aware of U2, and a very big fan by this point. I had all three of their LPs, including the newly released \\"War\\". I would have seen them play at Rochester Institute of Technology in '82 if it hadn't been for a huge exam I had to study for the next day.<br /><br />So here was my first chance to see them live, on The War Tour, with 800 other hard-core believers.<br /><br />Let me say they did not disappoint. In fact, Bono, Edge, Larry and Adam proceeded to perform the greatest rock concert I have ever seen, before or since. And I have seen everybody (including U2 in later years)! The kids ripped my head clean off! The energy was incredible. The sound, the songs, the stage itself, were all ablaze. Bono went as far to the back of the stage as he could get, and ran, full speed ahead, taking a leaping header into the crowd. That's right! Head first, arms out, like diving in to a pool, landing on the shoulders of astonished fans. I kept blinking my eyes, wondering if I had actually just seen it, or had hallucinated the dive. (On the Red Rocks video, by contrast, he carefully falls backwards in to the crowd). Bono had not yet achieved the God-like and masterful showmanship he would very soon have. At this point, he was flying high on his own energy, like a kid with a brand new rocket-ship. He was always right on the edge of control, at times literally staggering and swaggering, like he was drunk with his power. (By the time I saw them again in 1985, in a 20,000 seat arena, he had learned to channel and control that spirit like a Shaman). In Dallas in `83, it was already clear that Bono was an incredible performer and would-be Superstar.<br /><br />Speaking of The Edge, his guitar-playing, all shimmery and drony and dreamy, was a total rock revelation for me, myself a young guitarist. I soon went out and bought an analog delay effect like the one he used.<br /><br />The girl I took with me was one of those people who had never even heard of U2 before that night. On the way out of the show, she thanked me profusely for introducing her to the astonishing Irish Band. Haven't seen her since that night, but, I'll bet all these years later, she's still telling people, \\"I saw U2 before they were famous!\\"<br /><br />So, why do I post this review of \\"Under a Blood Red Sky\\", being that I was not at Red Rocks? Well, it's very fortunate for the world of rock music, and U2 fans, that it was filmed. Back in '83, I was really excited when I heard the film was coming out, and that indeed it was shot within days of the show I saw. It captures U2 on the rise to stardom, and why they deservedly became among the greatest bands in history. Of course I bought the 12\\" record and the VHS video as soon as they came out.<br /><br />Is Red Rocks as good as the Dallas show I saw? No. It's actually tamer by comparison. (Too bad they didn't film THAT one!). But will Red Rocks mesmerize you? Will it blow your mind?<br /><br />Might it be the best rock show you've ever seen?<br /><br />Oh yeah....terful showmanship he would very soon have. At this point, he was flying high on his own energy, like a kid with a brand new rocket-ship. He was always right on the edge of control, at times literally staggering and swaggering, like he was drunk with his power.

0385340990|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time. I laughed many times and cried many times. It reminded me of \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" which is one of my favorite books, certainly because of its being written as a series of letters and it is about England, but it also has the same humor and sadness.<br /><br />I'll repeat: I loved this book!
0778321606|2.0|A friend of mine lent me this book, thinking I might like it since I have lived in Seattle and like to knit, but I was pretty disappointed. The idea for the story was promising, but the storytelling was just too packed with cliches, and the character development was downright phony.<br /><br />The basic premise is that a cancer survivor opens a knitting store in an attempt at a fresh start: new job, new life, new independence from family. She holds an introductory knitting class, and meets three very different other women also looking for something new in their lives.<br /><br />Unfortunately these three women are hollow stereotypes: we have the snobby rich lady, the unhappy \\"career woman\\", and the goth chick. The author assumes the readers will be so unfamiliar with a young woman in goth clothing that, on the same page she is introduced, she flashes back to the traumatic childhood that yielded her \\"strange\\" way of dressing. These characters are introduced in a flurry of interleaved cliches and immediately confess their life stories and motivations to the reader. Aren't writers supposed to show instead of tell?<br /><br />The most troubling of these stereotypes is the \\"career woman\\" who has a vaguely described job in finance, and is punished for her ambition (by the author) with an inability to conceive, due to \\"stress.\\" So she quits her job and starts trying to get pregnant full-time, gives up her good health insurance to be on her husband's limited health insurance, which ironically has limited coverage of the fertility treatments she needs. And she pines and pines for babies. Moral: guess what modern woman, you can't have it all. It strikes me as particularly ironic that here we have a female writer punishing a female character for bravely trying to live a balanced, happy, successful life. Didn't this kind of thing only happen in the 50s?<br /><br />The back of the book claims that Debbie Macomber \\"understands the soul of women.\\" Not my soul, thank you very much.

B000NQRR1Q|4.0|Controversial director Roman Polanski ([[ASIN:B00003CXCF Rosemary's Baby]] and [[ASIN:B000UAE7RW Chinatown]]) has a talent for creating suspenseful films that utilize character actors in roles, which allow them to be ambiguous and amorphous. In his thriller, The Ninth gate, he returns to the genres he seems to be the most comfortable with: psychological suspense, and horror. Loosely based upon the book [[ASIN:015603283X El Club Dumas]], which was written by acclaimed Spanish author Arturo Pérez-Reverte, The Ninth Gate is a straightforward mystery/conspiracy with supernatural elements. The screenplay written by Enrique Urbizu, Roman Polanski, and John Brownjohn, greatly simplifies the novel, which was deemed too complex and plot heavy to film in its entirety. However, in spite of this harsh adaptive process the film is quite impressive, though it may be a disappointment for fans of the novel.    Dean Corso is an unscrupulous bibliophile and book appraiser, who specializes in rare and highly valuable books. When he is contacted by billionaire Boris Balkan to verify the authenticity of the satanic volume, The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, by seeking out the only other two existing copies. Balkan claims that he purchased his copy from a man named Telfer who committed suicide the day after he sold the book.  Corso goes on a mercenary quest that takes him through Europe and he crosses paths with some very strange and unsavory characters. He has a shallow sexual encounter with Telfer's wife, Liana, who desperately wants the book back. Corso also has repeat encounters with an enigmatic and beautiful stranger, who seems to show up whenever he needs help of some sort. Corso soon learns that she is not what she seems.  It becomes apparent that Corso is being closely monitored by Boris Balkan, who calls him repeatedly to demand updates on his success, and it's also apparent that Liana Telfer has sent her lethal bodyguard after Corso and the book.  While examining and comparing the different copies of the book, Corso stumbles onto a secret. There are subtle differences in the book's illustrations, which serve as symbols or keys to conjuring the Devil, and Corso realizes that all three copies are legitimate but only with all of the illustrations can one understand their true meaning.  As people around him start dying, Corso finds himself caught in the middle of a deadly diabolical conspiracy. He soon learns that some books are dangerous, that some mysteries should never be solved, and that some doors are better left unopened.    Stylistically, The Ninth Gate has much in common with 1940s film noir, as well as the more sophisticated horror films of the `60s and `70s. The film is very reminiscent of Roman Polanski's other films and yet it never feels redundant or predictable, which in itself is unusual when you consider the genre that he's working within. The film is boosted by a terrific score by Wojciech Kilar, and the combined efforts of the production designer, the costume designer, and the cinematographer. But the film's greatest asset is Polanski's uncanny ability to tell a sensational story while allowing the audience to suspend disbelief.  The Ninth Gate features a superb cast, which includes Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, Frank Langella as Boris Balkan, Lena Olin as Liana Telfer, And Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl.    The DVD includes an audio commentary by Roman Polanski, an isolated music score, a featurette, a gallery of satanic drawings, storyboard selections, production notes, cast & crew bios, theatrical trailers and TV spots.

B000B894AI|1.0|I do not expect mysteries to be great literature necessarily, but I do expect the ultimate denouement to be at least somewhat comprehensible and credible.  This one was neither.  The denoument of this plot was utterly contrived.  It was absurd, and lacked any and all credibility.  It was actually laughable. I feel cheated, having wasted  my time reading this whole book only to be met with such a cheap ending.
B000W91RUG|3.0|CBS's Monday evening comedy line-up is probably the most solid evening of light \\"popcorn\\" entertainment since NBC once owned Thursday night with character driven comedies like CHEERS or FRIENDS, but it's always been a roller coaster ride between the high style character writing of HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER to the pit of insult comedy of the inexplicably popular THE NEW ADVENTURES OF OLD CHRISTINE. Buttressing these extremes have been two of the best \\"guilty pleasures\\" around: TWO AND A HALF MEN (on the joys of being a socially failed straight man) and THE BIG BANG THEORY (on the joys of being a socially challenged geek).     The latter \\"Geek Comedy\\" has probably the least impressive \\"quality\\" writing (the best actual jokes are in Chuck Lorre's sublime closing cards that you can only read by \\"freeze framing\\" them - which thousands do every week), but it is also arguably the most fun. The fun in looking at the social problems of a group of four genius researcher friends - all holding doctorates won at tender years, the two leads are roommates - is difficult to defend except for the universal suspicion that none of us are as self-assured and \\"smooth\\" as we like to think we are, and the universal conviction that we are FAR smarter than anyone else thinks we are. We want to identify with these boys more at home on their computers than than with real life - and the women in our lives can empathize with the poor but gorgeous girl next door who understands and lives the definition of \\"cool\\" (despite never finishing community college) but recognizes that there is something honest and nice in her brilliant but helpless neighbors.    Most viewers know solid comic actor Johnny Galecki from his days on the old ROSANNE show (his character actually gives hope that brainiacs can breed), and he has only gotten better here - but for many of us, the revelation is Jim Parsons as Galecki's even more \\"fish out of water\\" roommate. Nothing shown in his last show (JUDGING AMY) led one to expectthis perfect comic timing and helpless comic earnestness. They are abily supported by a wonderful ensemble (Kunal Nayyar is genuinely outstanding as the physicist who can't talk to women - at ALL - without liquid tranquilizing).     The producers are not always \\"nice\\" to their characters - having Parsons in his underpants on the cover of the DVD from an embarrassing moment in an episode when the boys tried to get \\"Penny's\\" TV back from her hulking ex-boyfriend (a surprisingly funny recurring character) was probably unnecessary, but they always have them in humanly funny situations and surrounded by first tier comic actors.    The packaging of the DVD (the underpants notwithstanding) nicely complements the humor of the show - the episode titles are all postulated as scientific theorem, and there is a bounty of color photos from memorable episodes and there is a nice \\"behind the scenes\\" fraturette on the third disc (noting goodies like the very bad taste joke implied in the title and the actual science and scientific jokes they try to keep constantly on and in the set.    A guilty pleasure, but a very REAL one. This is one show which seems to be have the potential to keep growing and finding greater depth as seasons role by, but this first season (17 episodes with original air dates 9/24/07 to 5/19/08) laid down the basics and for fans who jump in late, should be an essential viewing. For the rest of us, it's well preserved and happily re-viewed memories.
B001FBSMW6|1.0|I have loved Keane since I bought their fist album. I thought their second album was pretty good. But this album is bad. A few of the songs are okay, although not very exciting, like 'black burning heart', and 'better than this'. I hate how 80's they went with their sound. If I wanted to know how Keane would have sounded in the 80's I would listen to U2. I hate U2. I like 80's music, just not crappy 80's music. And the song 'Playing Along' sounds like Radiohead, which I usually think is a good thing. But this song would be better if actually done by Radiohead. It would have had better lyrics, at least. The lyrics on the whole album are corny, especially the ones about monkeys. I am so disappointed. Keane used to be my favorite band, but I wish I had never heard this album.

B0013D8LOU|4.0|WARNING: This film contains graphic bloody violence.    Whenever Tim Burton makes a film with his wife, Helena Bonham Carter and his close friend, Johnny Depp as the film's stars... the result is typically bloody brilliant. That's certainly the case with Burton's filmed adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. The film is a dark, morbid, brutally violent revenge melodrama that follows the life of a wrongfully imprisoned man, as he seeks out the deaths of anyone whoever did him harm. Unsurprisingly Johnny Depp plays Sweeney Todd to perfection. With his maniacal stare, brooding demeanor, and haunting vocals, he shows that he can not only sing but also tread the line that separates horror from comedy. Helena Bonham Carter is also magnificent as the delightfully dreary Mrs. Lovett, the owner of a bakery where she makes gruesome meat pies (guess where she gets the meat from). The film also stars Alan Rickman as the sinister Judge Turpin, Timothy Spall as the demented Beadle Bramford, and the hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen as rival barber, Adolfo Pirelli. The entire cast is superb and part of what makes their performances so stunning is that none of them are professional singers. Though they might not possess the vocal talents that the cast of the stage musical had, they bring their own personalities and their own unique style to the songs, which have never sounded more contemporary.    Benjamin Barker was a talented barber and a devoted husband, whose idyllic life was intruded upon by tragedy and conspiracy. He was accused of a crime that he did not commit and sent to prison for fifteen years. After being released he makes his way back to his London home, where he reestablishes his barbershop on Fleet Street, but he now goes by the name of Sweeney Todd. Sweeney discovers that his imprisonment was the result of the scheming Judge Turpin, who coveted Barker's wife and then raised his daughter, Johanna as his own. Sweeney cravesthe satisfaction of bloody revenge, so he forms an alliance with the deranged Mrs. Lovett. It is Mrs. Lovett who conceives of the plan of disposing the bodies of Sweeney's victims by putting them into meat pies. So while Sweeney reduces London's impoverished populace, Mrs. Lovett creates the worst pies in London. Soon the situation becomes sticky when a young sailor falls in love with Johanna, earning the wrath of Judge Turpin and his toady, Beadle Bramford. And things only worsen when Adolfo Pirelli, a mountebank barber, discovers Todd's identity, which forces Todd to kill him in a particularly grotesque manner. As the bodies pile up and Todd descends into a self-destructive cycle of revenge, fortuitous circumstances lead him to make decisions that horrifically alter the lives of all involved.    The screenplay by John Logan is based upon Stephen Sondheim's musical, but he also makes sly references to English folklore and gothic horror stories. The film's greatest strengths are the quality of the acting combined with Sondheim's brilliant music. However the film is flawed in its execution. Quite often there's too much focus on throat slitting, which quickly becomes monotonous, as well as nauseating for squeamish viewers. Personally, the bloodletting itself didn't bother me so much as the repetitive nature of it. It's unfortunate that Tim Burton couldn't have found a way to show the killings in a more creative slapstick style. The film's look is priceless due to the immaculately created sets, costumes, and props, which plunge viewers into the seedy underworld of London in the 19th Century.  All in all, Sweeney Todd is a macabre masterpiece, a musical/dark comedy/horror hybrid that will either become reviled or beloved in time.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Although a bit long (keeps the suspense going) and took a few liberties (fortune teller), this is probably the best brooding Rochester ever and Jane the most unassuming as well. Kudos to both actors and the rendition that showed true love in the end prevailed no matter what. Ok, that may sound sappy, but the cinematography and sets/costumes were spot on. Looking at it from a technical stance, I can't imagine there being anything to criticize. The Cieran Kinds version was good, but he was too barky to Jane. And he never smiled, although he cried very well. Thanks MP for another splendid version.

It is dark as usual and yet the lyrics convey the age and maturity of the band. \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" is an awesome song. I have seen the video on myspace and love it. It is a tribute in a way to all the soldiers fighting in the war and you really should see it.

I think the G'ould were the best of nemesis verses the Ori.  The Ori, it was too forced.  The G'ould history was inter-woven with Earth's history, which made for a better, more relateable enemy.  I'm glad THEY made the Continuum. And if you haven't seen the two behind the scenes (making-of), I loved those too!

As a fan of many different styles of music, you hope that the artists you enjoy don't continue to make the same record over and over just because it sold well the first time. \\"Pretty Odd\\" is nothing like \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\", it's BETTER!  Take a listen to \\"Behind the Sea\\". If the lyrics \\"A daydream spills from my corked head breaks free of my wooden neck left a nod over sleeping waves like bobbing bait for bathing cod floating flocks of candled swans slowly drift across wax ponds\\" doesn't peek your interest to hear more, lets face it, you're dead!  \\"Pretty Odd\\" will definitely rank in my top 10 list for a long time to come!  Great job you guys!

B00005JPO1|5.0|Indy's back! That in itself is enough. We're seeing an old friend again after an absence that has been too long. When we were young we all wanted to be Indy. Now that we're old we want to be ourselves at thirty again. Old friends take us back and make us young. Indy let's us set out on one more adventure. We're young again. If we're doing things we've done before, thank God we can still do them.    Is it the best Indiana Jones ever? Probably not, but who cares? It's good. A bad day with Indy is better than a good day with anyone else.    The Nazi's are gone replaced by even nastier Soviets. If you don't think Soviets are nastier than Nazi's, you weren't there. After telling us that the FBI was paranoid about communists, Indy proceeds to find them under every bed and in uniform, too-not the FBI, the communists. From there on in it's mysteries, lost cities and saving old friends. Indy even finds a son.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Well I must say if you cannot agree that this is the greatest album of 2008 recorded by anyone, it is at least my personal favorite! And please do not take my proclamation lightly. I am a die-hard Megadeth fan, that is, they are my favorite band, and I thought this album was better produced and played than any of Megadeth's albums since Youthanasia. As for Metallica I have been a fan since Master of Puppets and this album is their best since \\"The Black Album\\" and it is definitely the heaviest since the 1992 release.     Among the highlights....    The first time I popped it in and as I listened to the first track I had a sense that Metallica would redeem themselves but I was simultaneously expecting a dissapointment i.e. St. Anger II. It wasn't until the second song during the interlude \\"The slave becomes the master...\\" that I began hearing a bit of the Metallica of old that we all know and love. Immediately following is Track 3: \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\" which is my favorite track on the album; it rings of the 1980's Thrash metal we all grew up admiring while breakin' our necks to it. The fourth song is the one you can hear on the radio the most these days and it is an instant classic initially similar to the songs in their \\"Load\\" album but then going off on a binge of head-banging early-Metallica style instrumental-mayhem. The fifth and sixth tracks are two more songs which I cannot stop admiring for their greatness; they are richly-written and performed with an astonishing talent, they are called: \\"All Nightmare Long\\" and \\"Cyanide\\" and our my second and third favorite songs after year 2000, respectively. The seventh track is the last I will speak of and it is the \\"Unforgiven III\\", for any true Metallica fan the name itself is enough to give you goosebumps and the song itself lives up to its saga. As I have said that is the last song I will review simply and honestly because I have not made it past track seven since I cannot refrain from playing the first 7 songs over and over again; I will say that I have heard them through once or twice and they only add to the redemption of Metallica.     One of the songs after track seven is a 10-minute instrumental similar to the epic \\"Dyer's Eve\\" off of \\"...And Justice for All\\".    And that is all I will say except that today, I am very proud to be a Metallica fan... once again.
015206396X|4.0|Graceling is the debut novel by American author Kristin Cashore. It is a stand-alone secondary world fantasy, although I'd hesitate to call it an epic fantasy. The writer is planning at least two more books set in the same world (the next one will be a prequel, called Fire), but Graceling is a single work mercifully lacking a cliffhanger ending. Interestingly, the American publishers are marketing it as a YA novel, although the British ones aren't.    Seven kingdoms sit uneasily alongside one another, constantly raiding and counter-raiding one another. A secretive organisation known as the Council is helping the common people of the lands survive in these harsh times. Meanwhile, certain people in the world are born with extraordinary abilities called Graces. Someone with the Grace of swimming can hold their breath for huge amounts of time underwater and swim like a fish, whilst someone with the Grace of swordsmanship is a brilliantly talented warrior, able to predict an enemy's moves with stunning speed.    Katsa, neice to King Randa of the Middluns, has the Grace of killing. She is the King's assassin, his enforcer and, when necessary, his torturer. She hates the role and yearns for a less violent existence. When her role in the Council leads her into a conspiracy over the kidnapping of the King of Lienid's father, she is forced into an uneasy alliance with Po, the Prince of Lienid, a Graced warrior of exemplery skill. The path they follow leads to startling discoveries over their own abilities, and their confrontation with someone whose Grace makes them almost unstoppable.    For a debut novel, Graceling is well-written, nicely-structured and easy to read. The characters are well-drawn and the storyline intriguing enough to draw the reader along at a good speed. The notion of Graces, although not hugely original, is nonetheless explored in-depth throughout the book with some nice, logical extrapolations of the abilities on show.    However, there are some issues.The names of the characters and kingdoms are all somewhat whimsical and occasionally distract from the seriousness of the tale. This wasn't a huge problem for me, but given that I know that some people pointblank refused to read The Red Wolf Conspiracy because of it, I know it will put some people off. Also, the ending feels a little bit too neat. True, the author throws a wrench into the final couple of chapters that was genuinely unexpected and means the ending is hardly all happiness and light, but still, all the storylines are tied off nicely. The only big unanswered question, the background and motivations of the main villain, will be explored in the next book.    Balanced against these issues is a well-drawn tale featuring interesting protganosits in a decently-realised setting. Whilst Graceling won't be generating Rothfuss or Lynch levels of excitement for a debut novel, it's certainly enjoyable and well worth a read.    Graceling (***½) will first be released by Gollancz in the UK as an export edition on 20 November 2008, followed by standard tradeback and hardcover releases on 22 January 2009. The US edition will be published by Harcourt Books on 1 October 2008.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|Will & Grace was one of the funniest TV series shows ever made.  These four actors are awesome in the parts they played.  I keep hoping that there will be spinoff shows.  Now I watch Debra Messing in The Starter Wife.  In it, you can tell that she puts a lot of her own personality into the characters she plays, and she did that with her Grace character.  I loved every episode.
1416562605|4.0|Winner of the 2008 Booker Prize, Aravind Adiga's debut novel \\"The White Tiger\\" offers a biting, wickedly humorous look at contemporary -- but hardly modern -- India, a place where the majority of people live in \\"the Darkness.\\" The incredibly fast-paced story follows Balram Halwai, an underprivileged Indian who becomes a driver to an upper-caste businessman and then, through an act of cold-blooded murder, rises to the top of the heap. Just don't call Balram a killer; he prefers the title \\"social entrepreneur.\\" The thrust of the story follows Balram's misadventures in some of India's biggest cities, but \\"The White Tiger\\" is finally a deeply cynical look at what Adiga's narrator calls the \\"Rooster Coop\\" of the subcontinent. Like chickens, Indians are \\"packed as tightly as worms in a belly, pecking each other.\\" The cruelest part is that \\"they do not rebel. They do not try to get out of the coop.\\" Indeed, Adiga's stand-in writes, \\"A handful of men in this country have trained the remaining 99.9 percent -- as strong, as talented, as intelligent in every way -- to exist in perpetual servitude.\\"
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a spectacle, full of luscious visuals, extraordinary costumes, and a very aggressive underlying theme of cheating, and losing at life.  This is not a contender for Kubrick's top five films of all time, and for good reason, but regardless, this film put me in a trance from beginning to end.  I had not read William Makepeace Thackeray's novel beforehand, so I honestly cannot add to the discussion of whether or not this is a proper adaptation, or if O'Neal's performance was right for the character.  I will however say what I saw, and that is a movie with Kubrick's visual style stamped on every single shot.<br /><br />The story is a rise to riches tragedy revolving around the life of an Irish lad by the name of Redmond Barry.  As a teen we are first introduced to his character as one who shares a romantic relationship with his cousin, Nora Brady.  When Nora is set to marry British military Captain John Quin, the naive Barry retaliates confronting the captain to a duel, which ultimately drives him away from his town, mother, and Nora.<br /><br />This starts Barry's long adventure to \\"becoming a gentleman\\".  Along the way he shall be robbed, enlist in the British army, serve in the Seven Year War, and become a professional gambler.  He'll finally acquire wealth beyond his wildest dreams when he manages to court Lady Lyndon, after her husband, Sir Lyndon, finally dies from years of crippling disease.  This starts a vengeful relationship between him and his acquired stepson, Lord Bullingdon.  From here on out Barry's ultimate demise becomes inevitable as his life falls apart into tragedy, mostly due to his own actions.<br /><br />As stated earlier by myself, Barry Lyndon is one of the most expertly shot films I have ever seen.  The visuals alone make this one of the best movies I've ever seen, but it is not at all a perfect movie.  Sadly none of Kubrick's films are \\"perfect\\", but that's intentional by the director, and no one comes closer to making perfect movies than Stanley Kubrick.  Though he's never really made a film with truly captivating human characters, his stories, and underlying messages have always been the strongest aspects of his films.<br /><br />Kubrick's dislike for humanity is as present as it ever was in his other films, even if not as strong as say `2001 - A Space Odyssey'.  Barry is always displayed as being a character that seems to be...well, he's hollow.  Barry is a man who hardly ever shows emotion, and once he is at the top you can't help but feel as though his mannerisms are that of a spoiled child.  You never really grow attachment to this character, and the narrator makes sure of that, which makes it apparent that Kubrick never intended you to grow truly fond of Barry, so when he ultimately is left poor and crippled you can't truly feel for him.<br /><br />That being said, Ryan O'Neal's Barry is not to be confused with a \\"cardboard character\\", like what you see in 80% of summer action films.  He's actually quite complicated, the only thing he ever shows passion for being the well-being of his son, Bryan.  The way he takes everything for granted, from Lady Lyndon, to his wealth, he just seems to not care about anything, other than his young son, who he spoils by treating him to whatever he desires.  This makes it apparent that the thing Barry loves most will be taken away from him in a cruel fashion.<br /><br />I'm not spoiling anything, because the ultimately, tragic ending of Barry's life is given away by the Narrator's first few comments over the course of the first hour of the film (and if you don't catch it there he'll announce it bluntly in the last forth of the film).<br /><br />When going into this film you shouldn't expect for something truly compelling, nor should you expect Barry to be an average Joe, whom you can relate to.  The movie is in no way intended for you to leave it with a smile on your face.  Don't go to a Kubrick film and expect a film that's intended to leave you happy (Even Dr. Strangelove, one of the best comedies of all time, had an ending that made you speculate the future of the human race).<br /><br />If you are new to Kubrick, these negative plot points may drive you away, but if you are familiar with his work Barry Lyndon will not surprise you in its underlying themes.  That being said, for people who are fond of period pieces, there are few movies that I've seen that can match the visual style of Kubrick's film.  While watching it you will feel swept away by the Academy Award winning cinematography of John Alcott and the costumes, which also earned one of the films four Academy Awards.<br /><br />Leonard Rosenman's winning score must also be acknowledged, for it also makes this film an attention grabber.  The music is never overused, and if feels perfect for the film.  It is full of elegance, something that could stand for the upper class which Barry tries so hard to be a part of, but beneath its beauty you can feel a sense of treachery, and corruption, which perfectly reflects the ruthless behavior Barry tries so hard to conceal beneath a façade of grace, but ultimately fails to keep it suppressed.<br /><br />The film is a must see for Kubrick, and fans of period pieces, but if you don't fall into one of those two categories Barry Lyndon may be hard for you to stomach, with its running time of about three hours.  You may enjoy this film, but it seriously depends on how you take in Kubrick's other work.  If time's a problem you can watch this film in intervals, because there are plenty of chances throughout to pause and take a break.  If you want to watch Barry Lyndon you'll need to pay it full attention.  It is better to watch it in intervals than watch it straight through while being distracted.  It needs full attention for you to take in its full impact.<br /><br />Not Kubrick's best, but I give it a solid 9 out of 10.one of the best comedies of all time, had an ending that made you speculate the future of the human race).

0151013047|4.0|I read this book within a couple of days. Although it's a bit long winded, I was enthralled by this man's story. In a sense he became exactly the same as his beloved Erica which fused his thoughts to become warped. This is not a man who simply condemns America but re-learns to love his own country and return to his roots. Maybe by rejecting his life in the US, he will come to find himself again. So much was happening when his transformation began. I just hope that the ending really isn't what I think it is. I can only hope.
1565117700|4.0|As a teacher, I purchased this audio CD of Of Mice and Men and absolutely loved it.  I used it with my 10th graders, and they enjoyed it so much, that every day they asked if we were going to listen to the CD and read the book!  I noticed that my most reluctant readers were actually overjoyed!    Gary Sinise does an excellent job voicing the characters and the CDs were pretty easy to navigate.  I fully intend on using the audio CD's with my students from now on! My sophomores from last year are still asking when I'm going to teach Of Mice and Men, even though they don't have me anymore!  I was extremely satisfied with the quality of the CD and excited to be able to bring John Steinbeck to my students attention, which is extremely important, considering we live within miles of where the book takes place and where Steinbeck lived (Salinas/Soledad).  I highly recommend purchasing this CD!
1416550518|5.0|I loved this book!!  Morton told a great story and I felt transported to another time and place.  I have always enjoyed this genre of fiction and Morton does not disappoint.  I couldn't put it down.  Some of the plot twists were predictable but some were not.  I also read the Thirteenth Tale that this has been to compared to....  I liked this equally as much if not more.  I can't wait to see what Morton is working on next!  Great Book!
B00003CXTG|5.0|I just don't understand how this movie got so much criticism and thumbs-down remarks.  This is by far my favorite movie up-to-date, and it takes a really super movie to get me to say it's my favorite.  Alot of people said it was mushy and that the love triangle was unrealistic.  Some reviews went as far as to say that the action sequences and the bombing were way too fictional and computerized.....    To begin with, let me just say that the World War II era fascinates me and I have read an enormous amount of literature (all true stories) from that time period.  I also had a grandfather who fought during World War II who told me an endless amount of first-hand stories when he was still alive......  I've read and heard the stories, I know the facts.... what Pearl Harbor portrays in both the fight scenes and personal lives of the characters is historically correct.  And the love triangle is not unrealistic.  Things like that happened and still happen all the time.  It is real life.  It is reality.  So.... you haters need to stop hatin' and take this movie for what it is-- a heartwarming story of courage, patriotism, and true love that is vanishing more and more in our world of today.

B001GAPC1K|3.0|Iron Man is solid super-hero fare which employs the traditional themes, tropes and symbols.  It should prove satisfactory to a broad audience, but could have been so much more satisfying, probing, or insightful if it used more clever storytelling.  Other than the themes it introduces about the military-industrial complex and US foreign policy, it is the same superhero origin story you have seen many times.     Robert Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges offer excellent performances.  Downey Jr. mixes cocky arrogance, critical humor, and a compelling transformation of a character who represents the worst aspects of the military-industry complex experiencing an inner conflict over the destruction that his inventions have caused.  Jeff Bridges was terrific, but the film used him to less effect than it could have.  At the onset, I thought Bridges only touched on his potential usefulness, which is when he plays someone who is operating at many levels, particularly as \\"the Dude\\" in The Big Lebowski, where he is always up to something, and nothing, all at once.  So at the beginning, I thought he might be up to more than just helping out Tony Stark; but, his character shifted from a helper to a plain-old greedy bad guy without the transformation that I think Jeff Bridges could have pulled off if the film gave him the time and context to do that.  Gwyneth Paltrow offers a convincing performance of a woman who sees beneath Stark's stark exterior and sees the man behind the jerk, and the suit.    The visuals, including Iron Man's heads-up displays and Tony Stark's computers and droids were fantastic.  The portrayal of the software underlying the hardware suit seemed to explain how this suit could actually work, and perhaps explains why this film could be made now instead of years ago - not only can digital rendering make a believable-looking suit for a movie, but the possibility of such a suit in today's world is itself more believable.  It's not a man in an iron suit, but a man with amulti-layered shell that is mediated through a software interface.  The film is aware of this, as Stark even comments on the newspaper's characterization of him as an iron man.  Nice touch.  Stark even suits up in a neoprene layer that would help to explain the buffer between him and the metal, as well as possible housings for the software - how the filmmakers missed the opportunity for an Under Armour product placement is beyond me!     The themes about US policy, weapons and industry lent an air of integrity to the film, but it seems those issues rapidly disappeared.  The irony, that Tony Stark becomes injured by the very weapons he manufactures, provides a great means to propel Stark toward his transformation.  The updating of the specific context from Vietnam (in the early comic books) to Afghanistan works very well, and shows that comic and superhero characters often reflect issues of their time and should be considered valuable forums for cultural dialogue.  However, the film seems less interested in those issues, and more interested in Stark's new suit.  It's unclear just what Stark's peace plan was, which means that although the film raises questions about responsibility and power (in both a personal, superhero sense and a national policy sense), it just leaves them behind to tackle the more personal issues and get the superhero flying around.  It could have also explored the theme of technological and human development, the boundary between machine and man, the exteriors we present to others compared with our inner needs and drives, etc.  Doing so would have made the film truly invincible, but unfortunately it just flies right on by those issues.    The biggest problem I had with the film, was that it was basically a two-hour origin story that followed, in the abstract, the same formula that every other superhero origin story follows.  Couldn't the writers have told us the origin story mixed in with a story progressing in the present?  I felt like I sat for two hours watching could have been a five or ten minute origin story.  Now that the film is over, I am ready to go see an Iron Man adventure!  In some ways, this is the problem with almost every super-hero movie - each new movie is just the same story with a new character, and then when it makes some money, the studio approves a sequel.  Two models that Iron Man could learn from are Star Wars and Speed Racer.  Part of why Star Wars (Episode IV) was so engaging is that Lucas explicitly left out the explanations - we were already caught up in an unfolding plot (he explains this in the audio commentary to the DVD releases that include the original film formats).  The opening sequence of Speed Racer manages to introduce the necessary origins at the same time it moves the current story forward.  Iron Man, however, is a movie about how another movie might yet come to be.  The filmmakers know this, and if you wait until after the credits, which for some reason I let the film run and caught this, you will see that they have one eye looking toward this future film.    Although Iron Man is a fun film that has some great visuals, conceptualizations, acting and political relevancy, I wondered why I had to sit through yet another origin story.  It is solid, though, and should please comic fans and general audiences.  Now that I've gotten the origin story out of the way, I look forward to the first of the Iron Man Adventures!    Format review:  The Blu-Ray disc that I watched has a nice special feature on the history of Iron Man, including interviews with Stan Lee and various other artists and writers who have worked on his stories.

B00000DHZJ|5.0|There are older Jimi Hendrix collections out there, like Smash Hits - but don't bother with them.  This is the one to get.  Like most say, this one really packages the essential hits.<br /><br />My only quibble about Hendrix's catalogue is that he came in an era where the audio recording technology available to him wasn't as sonically superb (only the Beatles would exceed all peers)...so it's a little rough here and there but the man's brilliance shines through.  Remastering has no doubt improved what was there, but it hasn't done wonders to enhance the mixes. Regardless, there was really only one Hendrix and his influence on those around him and those who came after was indelible.  Experience Hendrix!
B000W1V5VU|4.0|...I didn't!<br /><br />Okay, so I made it obvious with my review of `Ocean's Twelve', and before that with my review of `Ocean's Eleven', that I am really disappointed with the way these films have turned out.  With such an eclectic cast of big name, highly enjoyable stars you would think that these movies would be nothing short of amazing, but in actuality they have been rather boring, dull and forgettable.  They have even lacked any real charm.  I mean, these movies star George `king of charm' Clooney, not to mention Brad Pitt and yet they seem to fizzle as apposed to sizzle.<br /><br />That is about to change though.<br /><br />`Ocean's Thirteen' should have marked the beginning, not the end of the this franchise (I'm still scared they may try and pull of an `Ocean's Fourteen', and I'm not so certain they would fare this well again judging from their track record).  The film is witty, interesting, farfetched yet in an engaging and forgivable way, and get this; it has charm (thanks in large part to Matt Damon, who in my opinion was a weak link in the first two films).<br /><br />The film brings the boys back to Vegas where they attempt to outsmart (and bleed dry) a corrupt and dishonest hotelier named Bank who has cheated their friend Reuben, leaving him in the hospital.  Danny and his crew concoct a harebrained (I mean really, heists like these are impossible and totally preposterous to consider as valid) scheme to rob this man blind.  In the process they enlist the help of Terry Benedict, leaving their jilted past aside in order to ruin a man who has damaged them all.<br /><br />The scheme they concoct is probably the easiest of the three to follow and despite it's impossibility they make it seem almost probable (don't even try to attempt this at home).  Regardless of the fact that it is stupid to believe this can be done, the whole idea is rather neat and each and every part of the ultimate equation is fun to watch them work out.<br /><br />The acting is far better than the previous films as well.  Clooney is in even less of this movie than he was in `Twelve' (has this become Pitt's vehicle?) but when he is on, he is dashing.  Pitt is also charming, more so than the previous films, but it is Matt Damon that really takes this film to another level.  Maybe he was upset that `Twelve' used him so sparingly, and practically made him a laughingstock, so he decided that this time he wanted to be front and center.  Well, whoever decided it, it was a smart decision.  He adds something fresh to this movie, something that Pitt or Clooney could not.  Another surprise was Pacino, who sinks his teeth into his hammy role with so much charisma and grace.  I just loved him here.  Ellen Barkin is fetching as Banks' partner in crime, and David Paymer is devastatingly hilarious as the casino's VUP.  I really wish that there would have been more Izzard or Cheadle, but I cannot complain too much, for this film is so much more than I imagined it would be.<br /><br />It is still far from perfect.  I am not a fan of Soderbergh's muted use of color.  I mentioned this in my review of `Twelve'.  These films needed to be vibrant and colorful and he insists on giving almost every scene a yellowy tint.  I just don't like that very much.  I was just in Vegas a few weeks ago, and everything pops out at you.  For some reason Soderbergh doesn't get that.<br /><br />Still, I can honestly say that this is a pretty decent movie, and one that I would watch again without hesitation.  I only wish they had started with this and built up from it, instead of starting at the bottom, dropping below the bottom and then scrounging up something good for a final pow-wow.  It would have been really cool to have three films this engaging on the roster, but alas, at least we have one.etter than the previous films as well.

I really wish that there would have been more Izzard or Cheadle, but I cannot complain too much, for this film is so much more than I imagined it would be.<br /><br />It is still far from perfect.  I am not a fan of Soderbergh's muted use of color.  I mentioned this in my review of `Twelve'.  These films needed to be vibrant and colorful and he insists on giving almost every scene a yellowy tint.  I just don't like that very much.  I was just in Vegas a few weeks ago, and everything pops out at you.  For some reason Soderbergh doesn't get that.<br /><br />Still, I can honestly say that this is a pretty decent movie, and one that I would watch again without hesitation.  I only wish they had started with this and built up from it, instead of starting at the bottom, dropping below the bottom and then scrounging up something good for a final pow-wow.  It would have been really cool to have three films this engaging on the roster, but alas, at least we have one.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Awsome movie, loved it in theater but was dissapointed when I popped it in my HTCP and found out the hard way does not work with Power DVD 8 .<br /><br />I have downloaded all patches and have the latest build. I reseached it and found oout on thier forums that this is a know issue and no statement has been issued whether they fix it or not... I hope they will :-(<br /><br />If anyone knows any workarounds please share, thank you.<br /><br />JC

B00005KB9R|5.0|I own most of the stuff Marley ever did. My review is more a review of Bob Marley as it is for me very difficult to pick and choose one masterpiece over another or to seperate the man from the music. To analyze each song on any of his albums would be pointless as they are not songs, but gifts. Bob Marley was more than music, more than politics, more than love, he was spirit and hope.    I went to Jamaica twice in the mid seventies. I stayed in Negril which although not the stone age it didn't have electricity, and instead we had oil lamps at night. The shower was outside surrounded by the beauty of the local vegetation. Some of the local fisherman still used dugouts and hand lines. There was an innocence to the people (at least in Negril) and the feel of the island at that time was something that I had never experienced before or since. Of course all of this I am told is gone and it is a major tourist resort. My experience on the island will forever be one of the most beautiful memories in my life. Bob Marley was the national hero of Jamaica and the major force and spokesperson for his people. Somehow he truly embodied the spirt of all that was Jamaica. Catch a Fire, Burnin, Natty Dread, Kaya, and Exodus all were major works of art.    Although the earlier Catch a Fire is a masterpiece in it's own right, Burnin is probably the best representation of the edge that was part of the early Bob Marley stuff. Peter Tosh was still very much a part of the Wailers at the time and contributed heavily on this CD and therefore I think he added a balance to this one that one might say was lacking on later recordings. Burnin conveys the feeling of desparity experienced by the native people of the island and yet at the same time is uplifting. My personal favorite of Marley's stuff is Kaya. I honestly can say that no other recording has ever made me feel so contented or made me want to love life the way Kaya did. True story - In 1999 I named our new puppy Marley because he made us feel so happy and seemed to fill our lives. I thought I had really given my dog this unique name that no other dog would have. Several years later a book came out about a dog named Marley and the author said that he chose that name for the same reason I did. Bob Marley brought joy into this world. It may sound hokey, but he really did. I can think of no other person that better conveyed the need for peace and understanding in the world, not even Lennon. Bob Marley was a beautiful force in this world and his music was all about feeling good about life and the people in it. I miss him so much and I feel like I really knew what he wanted me to hear. I think that Burnin is a great place to begin to understand where Marley came from and where he wanted us to go.     In light of the present state of affairs in this world and this country, I can only think of a quote from Jackson Browne \\"It is so far the other way my country has come\\". We need people like Bob Marley to help us see the way. I see no one even close to his caliber on the horizon or presently walking on the planet.

0783219695|5.0|The movie APOLLO 13  and of course the real odyssey that took place in 1970 are more than just a near space tragedy and an aborted manned flight to the moon. They are about human determination, intelligence, cooperation and the fight for life in time of a very big crisis and challenge which in case of APOLLO 13 created a miracle. Returning safely back to Earth  was a miracle because after an oxygen tank exploded in the service module en route to the moon, the spacecraft was so crippled that, not only was the moon landing cancelled, but the astronauts in APOLLO 13 together with staff of Houston mission control had to think and act fast to solve many of the lethal problems that emerged in the spacecraft. The movie has historical value as well because it dramatizes excellently the APOLLO 13 adventure which certainly is a very important event in the history of manned space flights. I highly recommend everybody to watch this DVD, not just to people who are interested in manned space flights but also to people who want to see what miracles human determination and intelligence can achieve.
0394818237|2.0|I bought this book thinking that even though it was abridged it would be as great as the original version. Boy was I wrong, some of the most entertaining and interesting parts of the book are GONE!  It was absolutely heartbreaking. I don't know why the publishers have altered a wonderful book leaving it hollow and less interesting than it should be. Do yourself a favor, find an original edition on ebay or half.com . You'll be much happier.

B001FBSMW6|4.0|I have to admit, I didn't quite \\"get it\\" the first few times I listened to Keane's new CD. For starters, it is not as melodic as their debut \\"Hopes and fears\\" or its follow-up \\"Under the iron sea\\", and largely lacking in their heart string tugging ballads (\\"Bedshaped\\", \\"She has no time\\" or \\"Try again\\" to mention a few).<br /><br />The sound this time around is more upbeat and eighties sounding, very synth/beat heavy. Opening cut and lead-off single the Dance/Rock \\"Spiralling\\" with its thumping beats and \\"Oooooh\\" refrain has a whiff of Duran Duran/The Killers as does the driving \\"Again & again\\". The bouncy clap-filled \\"Better than this\\" reminds me in parts of David Bowie (\\"Ashes to ashes\\" to be exact).<br /><br />Other standouts are \\"You haven't told me anything\\", and \\"Black burning heart\\". For ballads, we have the beautiful piano Thom Yorke-channelling \\"Love is the end\\", \\"You don't see me\\", or the almost Jazzy/Waltz-like \\"Playing along\\".<br /><br />Look out for a beautiful eerie U2-esque bonus track, the ballad \\"My shadow\\" with soaring vocals from Tim.<br /><br />Don't be quick to write this CD off after just a few listens. While not as good as its predecessors, this is still a good CD and I applaud them for heading in a different direction, always a difficult move to successfuly execute.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I think many, when looking at the main star of this show (Bryan Cranston) will have only really been familiar with him from Malcolm In The Middle. He played Hal, a simple Dad with simple values and an unbeatable love for his family. Who would have thought that he can take a character with the same basic love of his family and create something incredibly unique from that. In Breaking Bad, Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry professor Walter White who's married with a handicap son who suffers from Cerebral Palsy and a child on the way.<br />One day Walter is hit with the ultimate bombshell as he finds he has inoperable lung cancer and has little time left to live. Walter realises that he can't assure his families financial security for the little time he has left being a teacher. He hears about a raid on a crystal meth lab that seizes millions of dollars worth of drugs which he decides that he must be a part of that. He knows how to make the best crystal meth ever seen, but not how to get it on the streets which is why he must enlist the help of his former student and drug pusher Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).<br /><br />I honestly didn't have high hopes for this show as, although I'm a huge fan of Bryan Cranston for his work on Malcolm In The Middle, I struggled to believe he could pull off such a train wreck of a character. The family is a typical middle class American family struggling to take care of their disabled son trying to make him have as normal a life as possible. In a way I can relate to the situation as I'm disabled myself and know how much of a strain it can be on parents. Sure, it's not the same disability, but the family struggling through it is definitely displayed well and R.J. Mitte as Walter Jr. is an excellent fit. Although I'm betting he was only cast because he too has Cerebral Palsy, he still fits the bill and plays the character brilliantly.<br /><br />Fantastic, fantastic show. I don't want to tell you much about the seasons events as it is quite short and risks spoiling certain events. I have to tell you that there are times in which this show doesn't hold back. It has no qualms about showing you the brutality of a broken man fighting against his own sense of morality, joining the drug world and even dealing with the fact that he killed a guy. Oh and obviously he's dying and is reminded of that from time to time but it's certainly gelled together brilliantly.<br /><br />Just to wrap it up I can only really say this TV show is amazing in every way and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. Bryan Cranston is a very underrated actor, but he's determined to prove himself for which he does a terrific job. When this DVD set comes out in the UK I'll certainly be one of the first to buy it.ing certain events. I have to tell you that there are times in which this show doesn't hold back.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|Reloaded is the second film in the Matrix trilogy.Following the events of the first Matrix film,Reloaded brings back the original cast to continue their fight against the \\"system\\" known as the Matrix.With the machines digging ther way towards the last surviving human colony,it's up to Neo and his comrades to bring down the system before all is lost.Just as the original Matrix set the benchmark for visual effects,Reloaded sets it twice as high by using the latest CG tools to create some of the most mind-blowing and visually stunning fights and chase sequences ever seen,along with more of the same extraordinary character depth that these films are famous for.Though not as strong in storyline as it's predecessor,Reloaded provides a refreshing and intellectual movie experience and sets the stage for the war to end all wars.
0743290119|2.0|Okay..Here's the thing.  I love chick lit.  I know that it is not, possibly, a politically correct term, but I do.  I wanted so much to love Chasing Harry Winston, but I just didn't.  I found it trite and terribly predictable.  I know arguably most 'chick lit' is predictable, but I wanted more from Chasing Harry Winston.  I found the characters extremely unlikable.  They weren't believable, and I felt like I wasted my time reading it.  I felt like it did not flow and left too many gaps in it's narrative style.    Sadly, I don't recommend this book.  I feel there are far better novels that will entertain you.

B001AIRUOU|4.0|When Nightmare was originally released, it was released through Disney's Touchstone Pictures banner. As director Henry Selick recalls, \\"Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, was they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming.\\"<br /><br />That certainly wasn't the case and this time around Disney has decided to adopt it's \\"step-child project\\". This, however, comes with a couple nice \\"Disney Perks\\" as I will call them.<br /><br />AND THE DISNEY PERKS ARE...<br /><br />1. Should I ever damage the DVD or break it, Disney has a replacement program in which you can replace your DVD through them for $6.95 - this is a pretty good deal and it applies to ALL Disney films.<br /><br />2. My DVD did not come with an activation code for digital copy. Rather than having to go through Amazon to return it, I called the 1-800 number on the DVD and Disney will not only replace my copy free of charge despite it being used, but they are going to pay the shipping both ways.<br /><br />As for the Special Edition, there are some great features. The bonus disc contains substantial features, the digital copy makes putting the movie on my digital devices a breeze, and the DVD itself comes equipped with a \\"fast-play\\" feature. This is a great buy for fans of the movie - but don't wait on it, Disney has a habit of cutting us off by placing their movies back in their demand-creating Vault.
B000002KOQ|5.0|I consider this to be Joni Michell's best work. Songs such as Willy and Blue Boy have a poignant melancholy that is unmatched. I enjoy the 'solo' work on her first three CDs the best of all her work. She is a wonderful song writer and intimate performer. And Ladies of the Canyon is my personal favorite.
B000S0GYRU|4.0|A lesser-known cult classic, Suspiria has been hailed as a masterpiece, a \\"candy-colored nightmare\\". Often called director Dario Argento's best work.<br /><br />The film may not frighten people today like it would have 30+ years ago when it was made, but it still manages to be effectively frightening though not in the conventional sense. The colors and set pieces combined with an eerie score give it a highly stylized nightmarish quality.<br /><br />Suspiria is unique among its genre. It is just as much a work of art as it is a horror film, something you just don't see anymore.
B000000WA4|5.0|\\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" is an incredible work from the American alternative band The Smashing Pumpkins. Released on October 24th of 1995, the double CD (triple album) features some incredibly diverse styles and more input from D'arcy Wretzky and James Iha, though certainly Billy Corgan is still the dominant creative member of the band.     The album is not afraid to take some chances. It opens with an instrumental, which is relatively soft. There is tremendous diversity, as the sound can go from acoustic to very heavy and vice-versa from one song to the next. The majority of the album is made up of relatively short pieces of less than five minutes, but there are a few longer pieces mixed in with the 28 tracks. The shorter pieces tend to stick to one type of sound, while a couple of the longer pieces are more diverse within themselves.     The opening instrumental leads into the excellent \\"Tonight, Tonight\\", but the softer and more orchestrated sound doesn't sound last as it then turns much heavier with tracks like \\"Jellybelly\\", and \\"Zero\\", and the first single \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\". The contrast in sounds goes back and forth, between the heavy and the light until eventually the group delivers a longer piece itself filled with contrast in \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\", which is then followed with the first half closer \\"Take Me Down\\". The album is a concept album of sorts, dealing with the very simple realities of life and death.     The second CD is more of the same, which is to say more diversity of sound and more changes and surprises. The transition from \\"1979\\" to \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\" is a great example of moving from one type of sound to almost its polar opposite from track to track. Not that every track change is so dramatic, but their changes help to keep things fresh and interesting. There also is a rather unusual use of tunings as well as instruments. Overall, this is an album which one needs to listen to many times, and one which the listener will hear something new each time. With its incredible diversity, there may be pieces which you don't like on this album, but for myself I found that they were all at least intriguing. From the titles mentioned before, to the delightfully odd \\"We Only Come Out at Night\\" and the stalker song done as a simple love song \\"Lilly (My One and Only)\\", this is a great album to experience over and over.     The Smashing Pumpkins are Billy Corgan (lead vocal, guitar, piano), James Iha (guitar, vocals), D'arcy Wretzky (bass, vocals), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums, vocals). Guest artists include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (\\"Tonight, Tonight\\"), and Greg Leisz (pedal and lap steel guitar on \\"Take Me Down\\")

0061440795|5.0|The complicated, back-and-forth emotions between the narrator and her relationships with the people around her astutely mimic adolescent insecurity and unawareness. Written when she was only eighteen, Sagan's novel of the destructiveness of ennui and naivete thus easily gets into the mind of a teenager. The thoughts written down are so commonplace to youth, that one will find themselves underlining whole passages due to their precise accuracy. Indeed, Bonjour Tristesse is more philosophical and devastating than many coming-of-age stories. Unsentimental, although sometimes laborious and heavy-handed, especially in Part One, the novel reveals the despair of wanting another to know one's thoughts, and the anguish of realizing the consequences of one's actions in the world of adult theatrics. The lyricism of the prose is ethereal and is eerily reminiscent of the work of fellow French writer Albert Camus. Simple stylistically yet complex in symbolism, Sagan has penned a tome that would make any psychologist tremble at the amount of material present to analyze and dissect.

B000BSLU2S|4.0|Hi all,<br /><br />Just bought this thinking that the Zalman CNPS9700 LED fan would need a good thermal paste.  Much to my surprise the Zalman fan came with a high quality paste (ZM-STG1).  In fact, I'm giving this paste only 4 stars because it's not as easy to apply as the Zalman paste, which comes in a bottle with a brush and used like white-out.  Be sure to apply a think coating on both the CPU and intended heat-sink of whichever paste you use.  SA5 paste requires a 200+ hour curing period with multiple heat cycles, whereas the ZM-STG1 doesn't.  The SA5 may be marginally better (1 degree C cooler), but that is questionable.  [...]
0375826726|5.0|This is a fantasy series in a fantasy world written by a young person primarily for young people.  Alegaesia is a land I enjoy visiting with characters I love or loath and moral lessons that are seldom touted in our day and age.  Why not simply read adventures like this for the sake of reading adventure?  Enjoy the storyline and the conflicts for what they are, refrain from dissecting the writing, and applaud a young man for writing a morality tale and becoming a successful writer before the age of 30.<br /><br />Is Eragon a conflicted soul?  Yes; and who is not these days?  To quote another great fantasy character--\\"the world is not split into good people and Death Eaters; we all have both good and bad inside us\\" (Sirius Black to Harry Potter in OOTP's movie version).<br /><br />Would it be better to have the hero not have a sense of conscience?  I certainly hope not!  Violence for the sake of \\"I'm right so you must be wrong\\" is too prevalent in the real world--at least in fiction, let us remember that all choices have consequences and with great power comes even greater responsibility.<br /><br />So what if the plot shares some basic characteristics with other fantasy series?  I daresay those same plot elements are often what make us decide we love fantasy in the first place--a fictionalized account of good versus evil in a world similar to ours with bad guys who are power hungry and reluctant heroes who step up because it is the right thing to do even if they are uncomfortable doing it.<br /><br />Mr. Paolini, you have given this older woman hope that our young people will indeed remember traditional ideas such as honor, integrity, loyalty, and respect (not only for people but for the earth and her creatures as well).  Thank you for the Inheritance Cycle.  We anxiously await book four!
0312263120|1.0|This books sucks. It stinks. It is a waste of paper and ink and I resent the time I wasted on it - though by the end annoyance and incredulity had given way to wry amusement at the author's incompetence.    The plot is ridiculous and completely implausible, with holes an eight year old could spot. To say that the characterisation is cardboard is an insult cardboard. The technical details are so inaccurate as to be laughable.    Utter, unmitigated rubbish. One star only because no stars is not an option.

0385340990|3.0|After I finished this book last night, I actually thought that it would make a good movie... maybe even a better movie than a book.  I almost feel bad saying that after reading the authors' notes.  Obviously Ms. Shaffer put a lot of hard work into this book and it was clearly a labor of love.  On top of that, her niece took over when she got sick to finish things up.  That said, I loved the whole idea of learning about the occupation of Guernsey during World War II via the letters and the characters.  We've all seen the usual Nazi movies, but this is a totally different angle.<br /><br />It's a clever approach to tell this story in letters in which the characters recall their days during the occupation.  It's interesting to hear how they had to make do with very little, hence the potato peel pie.  Also, the contrast between Juliet's big city suitor and her eventual island paramour is a good one.  While all of this pulled me into the story, there really was little else to keep me hooked.  Maybe the problem is that I read it over a few weeks instead of a few days, but I'm not sure.  I would have liked a little more drama or suspense instead of figuring out what was likely happen 50 pages ahead of time.<br /><br />Anyway, I think this book still has its charms and is entertaining.  As I said, I think this book would make a great little movie!
B00005JPS8|5.0|A movie like Iron Man only comes out once every few years in my opinion. A movie that blows away the competition and leaves the viewer wanting more. After waiting for months on news of its DVD release I pre-ordered it from Amazon and couldn't be happier. Robert Downey Jr is definitely at his best, Jeff Bridges performance is equal as well.  The DVD comes with loads of special features (at least on the two disc edition) and is a prize to behold.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|...but so is the SONG quality.  Sound quality can be awful but I can still tell what I like, no matter how bad the recording.  I can still tell that Hetfield's vocals are strained almost to the breaking point. And the lyrics wouldn't come off any better with better engineering.  Death Magnetic is basically not much more than St. Awful with some guitar solos added.  The sound quality punished my eardrums but the song quality punished my spirit.  I should not have to work hard to appreciate music.  I have liked nearly everything Metallica released before Load without trying at all.  And, heck, even Load and Reload had whole, coherent songs, even if only a few of them were actually any good.  St. Awful and this, it's just pure drudgery.  I will never listen to Death Magnetic again.  Please, take it away.
B001C4AFP8|5.0|Munich, then Syriana, and now Body of Lies.  All smart, smart, smart spy thrillers, and all current.  David Ignatius is a columnist for the Washington Post on international affairs. On the side, he is one of the best writers of spy fiction writing currently: he is, on a par with Robert Littell and Charles McCarry and, at most, a half step behind John Le Carre. Lies unfolds in the modern Middle East, Iraq and then Jordan, with sidesteps to Turkey and Dubai. (In the first scene in Dubai, one of our favorite buildings in Dubai was in the background, the Hotel Dusit.) Di Caprio plays a young CIA field agent. Crowe is his aging fat-around-the-middle handler and superior back in Washington, a man who cannot stop double-dealing, even with his own agents. Their objective is to entrap the head of an effective and up till then subterranean terrorist agency. If they cut off the head of the movement, they hope, the body will die. The movie plays out in a cascade of episodes, many of them grisly and all effective. Shot alternately in closeup (handheld cameras) and long shot (the view from overhead spy planes), they show the viewer how difficult it is to operate in an alien terrain where the enemies don't play by the rules. (The terrorists don't use cell phones or email so there's nothing to track.) In desperation, Di Caprio sets up a sting operation: he creates a false backtrail that insinuates that there is a second jihadist group out there drawing attention away from the master terrorist that Di Caprio and Crowe seek to capture. Di Caprio's sting leads to the death of an innocent and to Di Caprio's capture and torture - it's rough stuff, all of it, but it has the smell of truth to it. The movie is effectively filmed and efficiently plotted; the acting is always adequate and often much more than that. Russell Crowe is excellent (what a good actor he is!), Di Caprio is adequate to good, and Mark Strong as Hami, the head of Jordanian counter-intelligence, is absolutely superb. Body is really good.dy is really good.

B001DTPZNY|2.0|For enthusiasts, the bit rate of this DVD stays around or below 5 Mbit/s most of the time. Compression artifacts such as mosquito noise and block noise can be seen often. For an anamorphic 2.31:1 movie transferred in 2008, that's below standards, considering the running time is only 122 mins and there aren't many extras. (I do not intend to review the movie here).    They must be doing this to sell blu-ray discs, what a shame.
0375842209|5.0|but by the time I wiped away the tears at the end of it I knew I needed to give it five. This book was released as an adult book, rather than young adult in Australia. I picked it up, having never heard of it or anything about it. It was obvious from the first few pages who the narrator was, so I'm not sure why there seems to be a lot of reviewers who say they were confused about it. This book was very easy to read and did have an interesting storyline, coupled with loveable characters. All of the charactes have some flaw in their personality. That is what makes them real and that is what makes you relate to them. This is going to be one of those books that I continue to re-read for years to come.
B00005JLT5|4.0|The Pianist is one of those movies which holds your attention every minute. I was nearly afraid to see what was to happen next  all through the film !  I ordered an extra copy of the film to lend to my family and friends so that they could experience some of the horrors which had taken place when Hitler began his goal to take over the world.  A plus in the film was the excellent piano playing which for me was tear jerking.  I don't suggest The Pianist for the younger folk without adult supervision, but for those who have heard anything about the events during the holocaust in Europe, this movie will help to realize just what occurred during  during that period !!
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Ray's music is unbelievable and deep.  It truly gets under your skin and moves you.  He is one of the best singer songwriters out there now.  I love how slow and moving each track is, he just draws you in note by note, and his voice one of a kind.  I loved his last CD \\"Troubel\\" but this is deeper and slower, I already like it better.  Go out and listen to the whole CD without interuption and you know what I mean.  One of the best CD's of the year!

B001DTPZNY|2.0|It's pretty amazing that the same director who cranked out stellar blockbusters now consistently produces garbage.  I'm only in my twenties, and hardly nostalgic for the good old 80's, but his most recent movies have just disappointed and this was no exception.  They are typically entertaining at first but after about an hour I find myself looking at my watch and by the end I'm just waiting for the tiring storm of computer special effects to die down.  It was bad enough that Shia Laboeuf was casted for this but the second I saw the 'surprise' appearance of Karen Allen ... well, I nearly walked out.
0618918248|5.0|I realise, that \\"The God Delusion\\" by the (in?)famous Richard Dawkins has managed to stir the already not so calm waters of theistic discussion around the globe (or at least in the Western hemisphere), so I will tread carefully in my review.    I, myself an atheist and humanist to the bone, may be part of the choir that Dawkins apparantly is preaching to, but I still think his book is quite decent and informative. Looking at the reviews posted here and elsewhere, I doubt if Dawkins has managed to 'convert' many people to atheism with this volume, which was his intension when writing it. It has cast fuel on the fire though.     \\"The God Delusion\\" covers quite a lot of ground and applies a concistent scientific angle to the subject treated. I have always looked at the (non-)existence of God as more of a philosophical question (along the lines of Bertrand Russel etc)and not as much of a scientific one, which made this book very interesting. It certainly gave me something new to ponder. Especially the sections on ethics were of great interest to me personally. It is written with wit and a clear passion for his cause. He makes no excuses for any sort of pseudo-believing and stays right on track throughout. There may be only few new arguments or angles to find here and I think Dawkins comes dangerously close to oversimplifying things with his meme-theory (with which I was not acquainted before reading this volume, but will certainly study more in-depth now), and some of his arguments seem to work only (or at least best) in an ideal world ie like a physics experiment. There are also a few (and only a few) instances where the arguments would do with a balancing counterview or third option, but these instances are, as mentioned, very few.    All in all I honestly think, that \\"The God Delusion\\" is a good addition to the discussion of there being a supreme being or not. I also think that it is a shame, that so many people blankly refuse to read or consider the material in thisvolume. Sadly religion seems to be a thing which can only be seen in black or white.    4,5 Stars. Highly recommendable.

0810995212|2.0|Samir - I just read your review from yesterday. I acknowledge that this additional compilation showcasing Leyendecker's abilities and genius is long overdue.  Michael Schau's book of almost 35 years ago was limited in many areas.  The printing technology had not approached today's standards and abilities and there was very little information available on J. C. Leyendecker.  The internet and digital processes changed all of that.  The printing in this new book is much better than anything available before, but the reproduction of images falls very short of today's abilities.  Maybe there were budget limitations that restricted the proofing and fine-tuning.  Nice to see the larger reproductions of Leyendecker's original paintings, which brings me to one of the major problems!  On page 98-99, a reader is exposed to a 2-page reproduction of a painting - supposedly done for the Arrow Comp. This should be one of the motherlode pictures - especially since JCL was so instrumental in creating Arrow's popularity.  Many people associate Leyendecker with creating the \\"great Gatsby look\\" and developing the image of the ideal man.  Unfortunately, a viewer is smacked with a COUNTERFEIT - a Leyendecker forgery.  This is not the painting that Leyendecker created for Arrow Collars!  In fact, it is only a 2nd-rate knock-off.  Many readers might not recognize that fact but the original Arrow Collar advertisements do not lie. 100% FAKE!    Do the authors not know the difference?  How were the pictures chosen for this book?  Maybe the Cutlers only wrote the biographical part of this book.  Attention purchasers!  There is so much innuendo and fiction in the reading, it is hard for a person to de-code what is real and what is totally fabricated.  Only 12 footnotes for a biographical work of this scope?  The authors have contrived details where there weren't any.  They have concocted stories from the inaccurate details.  If you want to buy the book, do it because you love the work of J. C.Leyendecker.  The quality of the pictures is better than anything published yet - but the rambling paragraphs are sometimes a joke - especially the paragraph about Charles Beach tending to Leyendecker when he collapsed from a heart attack.  Do the authors expect any reader to accept the details of that event as fact?  C'mon!  Please Mr. & Mrs Cutler, don't insult your readers - the people that eagerly paid almost $50-dollars for a book that reads as one big April-Fool's joke.    I feel like I should be given a rebate - or refund.  Authors should stick to what they know as fact - don't make up details when they aren't available.  Omissions are understandable - but this book shouldn't be regarded as fiction.    Tom Schacks
B001FBSMW6|1.0|I had been a huge Keane fan till the moment I put this CD into my car stereo. This album is unbelievably disappointing. Why does this album have to be so experimental, just like Coldplay's recent album? I didn't like Viva la vida very much, but this one is far worse than that. Typical Keane sound is blended into some lame 80's pop music tone, basically ruining catchy melody lines. \\"Playing along\\" is pretty much the only song I like. Tom Chaplin should really be singing \\"Pretend That You're Alone\\" like this : \\"Forget about this album, forget about Keane.\\"     I don't even want to talk about Tom's singing style on this album. It's a waste of his beautiful voice.     Tim has been adding more and more electronic sound since their most successful album, \\"Hopes and Fears.\\" I really wish Keane's next album will focus more on acoustic piano sound.
B001E75QH0|3.0|Don't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with this boxed set.<br /><br />The issue is that there will be a new, more exhaustive and comprehensive box coming in the next six months. It's coming. Don't be fooled!<br /><br />If you must have the new movie now, then just buy the one disc. Wait for the new collection later.<br /><br />That being said - the transfers and quality of the DVD's within are good. The special features are fine. It's complete now with all 4 films, which is nice. But I'm all for having one copy of every movie that I love, and not duplicate my collection by buying something which is bound to be obsolete shortly.

1596434252|3.0|This book is really cool.  I looked through it and found it interesting.  However, most adults can find an alphabet pop up book only entertaining for a short time.<br />I had some little kids come to visit me.  The oldest was 4 and she didn't get past about D before deciding there must be something more fun to examine.  I really wanted to like this and keep it around.  I just couldn't find a use for it.<br />It still gets three stars for being really cool.  Maybe if I had a pediatricians office or something.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|With Keane's \\"Under the Iron Sea\\", you could tell that dark things were afoot.. The band almost broke up.. Rehab was needed... Things didn't look good, even though the music was brilliant..     This time around with \\"Symmetry\\", the band changes course and has created a real mix of grooviness.. I'm not sure where the 80's comparisons are coming from however.. It's POP music, so almost by definition, it's going to sound poppy, just like 80's pop sounded poppy...     I haven't digested the entire CD yet, but at first (and second) listen, I'm really, really pleased with what I'm hearing.. While I LOVED the dark overtones of \\"Iron Sea\\", this new found lease on happiness is a shot in my arm at a needed time.     If there's any criticism I could offer is that sometimes it seems they do try too hard to reverse the darkness.. Sometimes it seems a bit forced, but maybe it's the weirdly tuned synths that catch my ears the wrong way..     I LOVE that this band isn't content to sit on it's well earned, but well worn laurels.. I love the experimentation while keeping the essence of Keane intact.. Thanks boys! Let's hope you'll hit New Mexico sometime soon..     ON EDIT - I finally got around to reading the liner notes and was shocked to see that guitars have finally been added to the mix, albeit minimally.. I guess that just goes to show they felt they had taken the pure piano,bass,drum formula as far as it could go..     and I will admit now, that I can hear some of the 80's influence on a couple of tracks, but it is by no means pervasive throughout the entire CD...

B001DTPZNY|2.0|\\"Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" attempts to resurrect the Indiana Jones trilogy that we thought ended 19 years ago by moving it from the World War II era to the Cold War. About 20 years have passed since Professor Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones, Jr. discovered the Ark of the Covenant in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". He's still teaching, digging, and being caught up in international intrigues. A young man named Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) shows him a coded letter written by his godfather Harold Oxley (John Hurt), an old school friend of Indy's. Harold claims to have found a Crystal Skull that legend says will give its mysterious powers to whomever returns it to the mythic city of Akator. Harold and Mutt's mother have been kidnapped, so Indy and Mutt are off to Peru to find them. But a Soviet Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), who has an intense interest in objects with paranormal properties, seeks the Skull as well.<br /><br />While previous Indiana Jones films were inspired by the adventure serials of the 1930s, George Lucas conceived this one as a take on the sci-fi exploitation films of the 1950s, the decade in which it takes place. Spending a fortune to cross one low-budget genre with another is probably not the cleverest idea. But low-budget genre films succeed because they take themselves seriously. [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Raiders of the Lost Ark]] (1981) did that and improved upon the films it emulated, as did Lucas' [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars]] (1977). [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]] (1984) was entertaining. The series went off the rails with [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]] (1989). Almost a parody of the genre, it was dull as dishwater. \\"Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" continues the descent into self-conscious silliness. There is no suspense, no real emotion of any kind, action scenes aren't remotely credible, Indy survives a nuclear blast in a refrigerator...I could go on. And there is so much conspicuous CGI that I felt like I was watching a cartoon.<br /><br />It's obvious that the filmmakers had a lot of fun making \\"Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\". It shouldn't be so obvious that the folks on screen are having fun -even when their lives and limbs are supposedly imperiled -while the audience sits bored out of its gourd. The level of self-indulgence from Spielberg & Co. rivals that of Soderbergh & Co. in the last two installments of the \\"Ocean's\\" series. There seems to be a conceit that if they're having fun, the audience will have fun watching them have fun. And, in this case, watching them play around with CGI. No writing or credibility necessary. How obnoxious. And Shia LaBeouf is dreadfully miscast.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): There are 2 featurettes on the single disc edition. \\"The Return of a Legend\\" (18 min) interviews director Stephen Spielberg, co-writer George Lucas, producer Frank Marshall, writer David Koepp, and the cast about how they came to make another Indiana Jones movie and how the film was conceived. \\"Pre-Production\\" (11 min) interviews Pre-Visualization Supervisor Daniel D.

B00192IOBA|5.0|I'm glad I caught Jason Mraz this morning on VH-1 Jump Start as I was not familiar with him before. He clearly had his own style that made me think of the raw talent of a young Billy Joel or Paul Simon. I expect to see much more of him as I think he has a distinct talent. His song \\"I'm Yours\\" has a great melody and beat and should be enjoyed by people of all ages and walks of life. Yeah your shaking that foot to the beat. It makes you want to get up and dance even if your old and watching the sunset. Of course that is figuratively speaking. I won't be old until I hit the first hundred! Great album but at the very least download \\"I'm Yours\\" for your MP3.<br /><br />CA Luster
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I will not give a play by play because it seems like everyone does. It is just plain good, yes there are some silly parts, some predictable parts and some not needed parts . . . but the rest is wonderful.<br /><br />I enjoyed every minute and plan to watch it often at home :)
B000001FHV|5.0|After you hear Meat Puppets II and Up on the Sun, do yourself a favor and check out \\" Too High to Die \\". Naysayers have a HUGE amount of negative claims about this fine album. Like that it was a grunge copycat album ( SO not true ), and that it was a huge deviation from their original sound. If by original sound you mean the Meat Puppets self titled debut yes, but pretty much everything they've done since then has been nothing like that. This album is gorgeous. In Up on the Sun, the Kirkwood twins were really starting to learn the art of singing together in harmony and on Too High To Die they've mastered it. Their singing is some of the best of any of their albums. It is true that one or two of the songs on here have some simplistic guitar playing ( like violet eyes ) but everything else on this album is a slightly more evolved version of their material on Up on the sun, Monsters, Mirage, and even takes after some of their songs on Meat Puppets II like Oh Me, were here, or Climbing.  Majestic songs like Never to be found, Severed goddess hand, Flaming Heart, Roof with a hole, and Backwater make this possibly the best road trip album of all time. And peppy songs like Shine, Violet Eyes, and we don't exist just plain rock and they are good inbetween songs. In all seriousness, if you love the Meat Puppets, just buy this album. It's one of their best. It's got a very Grateful Dead meets Dinosaur Jr type feel to it and it's just excellent. This is 90's Classic Rock

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I admit that one of the main reasons I watched this action film twice at a premium-priced cinema was to admire the gorgeous, chiseled facial features and toned chest muscles of the lead actor, Christian Bale. (Even my next door neighbor, a woman in her late 60s, admitted a similar motivation in taking her grandchildren to The Dark Knight, calling Bale \\"beautiful to look at.\\") That admiration aside, what a tour de force!  The Dark Knight sets a new standard for action films in general and adaptations of comic books in particular. My ex-boyfriend (with whom I am thankfully still on very good terms) introduced me to the world of DC comics and took me to Batman Begins, filling me in on the synopses of the Batman legend, culled from years spent poring over the comic books created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger and then revisited by Frank Miller.<br /><br />This movie is a wonderful second installment of the new Batman movies.  The ensemble cast was top-notch, and the untimely death of Heath Ledger makes his rendition of the Joker especially memorable.  It was impossible not to mourn for Ledger while watching this very distinct characterization of the Joker.  This wasn't Tim Burton's comical Joker whom only Jack Nicholson could portray.  This was a tragic, dark villain who desperately needed psychiatric services (but not from Dr. Crain/The Scarecrow!).  You get that there's a backstory of abuse that shaped this character's personality, though the Joker told serveral different versions of the origin of his \\"smiling\\" scars, so we're never sure about what really happened.<br /><br />Warning: Spoilers<br />Batman wanted to hand over his role of Gotham's protector to the district attorney, Harvey Dent, a man who seemed unmarred by the city's corruption.  Though Bruce believes in Harvey Dent's integrity, the two vie for the love of Rachel.  Rachel had promised Bruce that once he puts the caped crusader behind him, she would be interested in a romantic relationship.  Rachel's condition for a relationship becomes a huge motivation for Bruce to appoint a new \\"knight\\" to carry the torch of Batman. However, those conditions become compromised when Rachel accepts Harvey's marriage proposal.  Unbeknownst to Bruce, Rachel's feelings have shifted, and she writes him an (undelivered) letter to express her changed sentiments.<br /><br />At a pivotal moment, Harvey Dent publicly claims, \\"I am the Batman,\\" thus continuing to obscure Bruce Wayne's secret identity.  Later, the Joker arranges for both Rachel and Harvey to be taken hostage, with Batman choosing which person to personally protect.  Of course, Batman follows his heart and tries to rescue Rachel, but the subterfuge of the Joker switches locations, and Rachel is lost.  For a man who boasts that he doesn't make plans, the Joker seems to have his chaos agenda well in hand, being at the right place at the right time to bring about the greatest amount of destruction.  Harvey Dent is not the same after Rachel's death, and the Joker's cynicism seems to be realized in Harvey's moral decline. The Joker gloats to Batman that even the best of men can be brought down under the right circumstances.  (To be honest, I think that if you alter someone's brain chemistry--that is, neurotransmitters are out of whack and the limbic system hijacks the frontal lobe, the area of the brain responsible for higher reasoning and judgment, you can bring out the worst in that person and distort what s/he is really like.  But I don't share the Joker's savage misanthropy and cynicism.)  Batman is devastated by Harvey's retaliatory killing spree, and thinks that he must sacrifice his own reputation to keep people's faith in the good in man.<br /><br />Here's where I have a bone to pick with the storyline in terms of logic.  James Gordon knows the truth about the killing spree, and this \\"good cop\\" doesn't think that those deaths can be covered up.  Umm, yes, it's called attribute those deaths to the Joker himself and his henchmen.  There was so much confusion and chaos at that time, that I think Batman's sacrifice is both unnecessary and nonsensical. I don't think it'd be much of a stretch for the citizens of Gotham to believe that the Joker was behind those deaths. I see the heroism in being willing to take the blame for things you didn't and wouldn't do while being faulted for characteristics that you don't have, but...  If Bruce Wayne himself, and not through the safe distance of his alter ego, was accused of things he didn't and wouldn't do, I don't think he'd be able to bear it (as taking on this blame runs much deeper than the \\"irresponsible party boy\\" image that he promotes as a ruse to keep his Batman identity hidden). There are few things more painful than a false accusation, i.e., being blamed for things you didn't and wouldn't do. Furthermore, Batman was the larger-than-life protector of Gotham, a fusion of technology and the supernatural.  It would be just as devastating if not more devastating for the citizens of Gotham to realize that their caped hero was the villain--that would really shake up their confidence in the good in man and lend credence to the Joker's cynicism.  They love this ethical \\"outlawer\\" more than the district attorney.  I think that keeping Harvey's reputation in tact shouldn't be at the expense of Batman.  If Harvey Dent, the \\"White Knight\\" with his reputation untainted, is dead and gone, and Batman has become a senseless murderer, how is that of comfort to the citizens of Gotham?  How is this new state of affairs going to help Gotham feel safe and protected, while encouraging people to believe in the best in themselves and others?<br /><br />Don't ask me, I didn't write the script. Maybe the next installment will make sense of Batman's sacrifice. But I did appreciate the intelligence, Oscar-caliber acting, and action of this blockbuster. And of course, the physique of Bruce Wayne (my friend and I said in almost perfect synchronicity, \\"Oh my God\\" the first time Bale took off his shirt!).n and chaos at that time, that I think Batman's sacrifice is both unnecessary and nonsensical.

The Austin Concert is really something to see with a wild and elaborate set design and the Stones full of energy and in top form. The DVD transfer is exceptional and looks almost HD. Nice to hear Sway live too!<br /><br />The second concert from Brazil is also a fantastic show, especially the aerial shots are amazing and the endless sea of people(all 1.5 million of them!) is really something to see. I do prefer the performance a little more on the Austin show though.<br /><br />The 4 disc set has the two concerts(I believe edited to keep the set from being redundant) and a collage of several songs from concerts from around the world. There is also a ton of extra material. This is one set you shouldn't pass up!

0307388840|3.0|Overall, I liked the book but do consider it over-hyped.  I enjoyed the first part and didn't have a problem with the same \\"scenes\\" described from different people's perspective that some people seemed to have.  Actually, I thought that worked very well.  I thought the characters were very well drawn out and you could understand (may not agree but understand) their motivations.      If you're expecting a twist or deep secret, don't.  There isn't one.  Most people will figure out what is going on and who did what right from the start.       For me, the book falls apart in the second section.  It is still well written and very descriptive, perhaps overly so as some have pointed out.  But I did think I got a feel for London at the beginning of WWII.      Spoiler Alert.    I don't necessarily like happy endings but the ending is unsatisfying.  The man who actually molested a child ends up marrying her and evidently lives happily ever after.  You don't really get much sense of where Briony has been other than that she is losing her memory.  BTW, I thought this was a nice touch.  Evidently she is being tortured by what she did and, short of death, this might provide her some relief.  And the hero and heroine die during the war.  The book ends where it started with Briony's play.  Didn't see the point of that.  Interestingly, the movie took this scene out completely and replaced it with Cee and Robbie frolicking on the beach near the cottage she had arranged fro them to go to after Robbie returned.  I guess the movie producers thought that the ending was too much of a downer and put in that fantasy scene.
B001AXME2S|5.0|I'm not a Shinedown fan. Before this album, I was only familiar with their song, 'I Dare You.'  I was searching Amazon.com for some kind of rock music to put on my Oakley Thumps and listen to while running. After reading the positive reviews, I decided to check this out.  I'm 38 and this is one of the best rock albums I've heard. At first, I liked the fast-paced rock songs, but wasn't too enthused about the slower ones.  After listening to the lyrics over and over, I now love every song on the album.    If you listen to no other song on the album, download 'Sound of Madness.'  That song will rip your skull open, take your brain out, pound it on the pavement, then put it back.  When I first bought the album I couldn't stop playing it.  I still can't.    If you like rock (FYI - Pearl Jam Ten is my favorite album ever), I think you'll like this.

B00192IOBA|5.0|While \\"I'm Yours\\" is the song that made me buy this CD, \\"We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things\\" is a wonderful collection of songs that are fully deserving of singles status. Highly modern writing for the \\"Y\\" generation, Jason Mraz doesn't give in to the old love song seriotypes. Every song is deeply moving and repeatable (my favourite being the highly moving, deeply written \\"Details in the Fabric\\") and well worth the cost.

B00124JEJ6|5.0|Enough has been written about this album over the years to fill a telephone book.  Yeah, it's not the greatest sound, but the remastering from Rhino Records does improve it.  Sure the performances are more raw than their studio counterparts, but the excitement is still present, perhaps even more so.  When the Terry Kath era Chicago was on, they were ON and wow, are they ON all over this album.  Terry's guitar solos dominate the package, but everyone gets a taste throughout this massive set. Who knew Robert Lamm was an excellent jazz pianist?  You find that and many other surprises waiting for you in this magnificent monument to a once-amazing band,  Oh yeah, there's an additional disc of unreleased performances as an added bonus and believe me, they are just as good, if not better than what was on the original Carnegie Hall album.<br /><br />This is why Chicago is being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Kath era!  Do NOT hesitate to pick this one up!
0525478183|5.0|Paper Towns is one of those books that leaves a person with a slightly uncomfortable feeling of bigger-than-normal ideas and understandings that hover in the brain after reading the final page; those ideas and understandings linger for hours, settling bit by bit into very important parts of a person's mind until the person realizes that the feeling can only mean one thing... \\"That was one of the best books I've ever read\\"    One of my pursuits in life is to experience that feeling as often as possible. It's why I read and why I watch films... to find a work that affects my feelings to the point that it affects who I am as a person. Paper Towns is one of those precious few works that has generated that feeling in me.    The ideas are not new, but they're so beautifully and realistically written that they're impossible to think of as overdone. The writing is hilarious and poetic and crude and beautiful all at once.    I will be recommending this book to every young adult I know. 50 years from now I fully expect that it will fill high school classrooms the way Catcher in the Rye does now, and that the crudeness and comedy will lure unsuspecting teenagers into the world of great literature.
1416594884|4.0|John le Carre is such an enduring author.  He's now in his seventies and has authored over 20 novels.  le Carre, as most know, actually worked for MI6 (British intelligence) in the `60s.  He based most of his early novels on the experiences he gathered during his tenure with British intelligence.  And those novels, set in the period of the cold war, I feel are his best.  I am particularly fond of his character, George Smiley, the aging spy that was often overlooked and underestimated, to his opponents peril.  George Smiley was pervasive in le Carre's early books and his masterpiece, \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\".      But these are different times, le Carre has moved on and, alas, George Smiley is no longer with us.  The intelligence battlegrounds have shifted from eastern Europe and Russia of the cold war to a more global perspective and so have le Carre's books.  In this book,  \\"A Most Wanted Man\\", le Carre confronts the global war against terrorism.    The plot centers around Issa Karpov, a Muslim with possible links to known terrorists.  All the western intelligence services are interested in Karpov, and all for different reasons.   Karpov has taken refuge in Hamburg and Thomas Brue, an emotionally drained English merchant banker there, is determined to help him -- but not for very altruistic reasons. From there, it gets complicated.      It is this complication in le Carre's novels that make them so wonderful; nothing is simple and seldom are things as they appear.  Le Carre is a master of storytelling, weaving intricate stories where a tiny bit of information disclosed early on has a profound effect later as the plot progresses.  But have no fear, le Carre's skillful prose allows the reader to follow the story without much difficulty.    Le Carre is not a flashy author, nor are his characters.  Few bodies are left to clutter the landscape and there are no gadgets, just human beings trying to survive and out think or manipulate their opponents.  With le Carre's characters, it's a battle of wits, not of brawn nor technology.  This is a darker novel than le Carre's earlier works, not Gothic in despair, but with an undercurrent of pessimism.  It is as if le Carre is mourning the simplicity of an earlier time, the cold war, when lines were more clearly drawn.      If you have enjoyed other le Carre novels, you'll enjoy this as well.  If you are new to le Carre, I encourage you to take the plunge into a human conflict bereft of obvious heros.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|Its not a one star movie but it is LAME. I cannot believe how these creative giants, Spielberg and Lucas would ever put there seal on this let alone Create it. It is campy, almost a spoof on the whole series, with everyone just walking through the parts. The ridiculousness of the plot, the villians, the character interactions all combine to create the conclulsion this movie was made only for money. My question is why. The monster mogals have far more than they can ever spend so why tarnish their reputations. It did promote Spielbergs belief on Aliens, but he could have picked a far more intelligent vehicle. Oh well, let me just close by saying this was not even worth renting, a waste of TIME a very precious commodity indeed. JB

B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|Great Romantic Comedy for everyone. This is about a player living in Hawaii who has one night stands with the hot women vacationing there. He soon realizes that he wants something more and decides to give up that lifestyle. While eating breakfast he sees Drew Barrymore and its love at first sight. For him. He goes to her table and talks with her and they hit it off right away. They talk throughout breakfast when she realizes she is late for a meeting. They make a date to meet at the same place the next morning. The next morning he shows up and sees her already sitting at the table. He approaches her and sits down. He starts talking and she kinda freaks out saying I don't know you, I've never met you before and runs out of the restaurant. The lady who owns the restaurant explains the situation. She has short term memory loss. She will never remember him. She lives the same day over and over and has been for over a year. He refuses to give up so every day he thinks of different ways to break the ice and talk to her. He tries to get her to love him each and every day. Sometimes it goes well and sometimes it doesn't. He refuses to believe that she isn't starting to remember him when everyone else knows that isn't true and tries to get him to stop wasting his time.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The West Wing is my favorite all time TV drama, and now owning this complete box set is nothing short of fantastic.  From the pilot to the final episode, I made sure to watch the original TV show, and then watched the repeats in syndication.  I am just starting to review TWW by way of this DVD Collection and enjoying each scene. If only we could have a POTUS like this one portrayed by Martin Sheen, not to mention TV dramas with such impressive writing!  I've got my bowl of popcorn at the ready whenever I pop in a disc! I recommend this set to anyone - Democrat, Republican and Independent - before or after the November election.

B0002S947K|2.0|Mellow, artificial singer - average songwriter. Pained, uninspired, oh-so-serious music with no smiles. Music is supposed to be fun - this isnt. Reverential, heavy with meaning, but so boring and tedious ya wanna scream.    The exception is \\"All The Wild Horses\\" A work of inspired genius. The rest are all immediately forgettable.

1577314808|5.0|This is an excellent book which should unseat all our false modes of behaviour, reference and logic.  We facilitate the finance houses in collaboating with them in cheating us out of our present.  This book should rid us of all the fears we shore up about our lives.  We should be able to undo the hold of the past & the tyranny of the future.  What perfect timing for this book.  For these thoughts & insights just as the western world especially is going through a very necessary correction process.  We placed too much emphasis on the wrong things for too long & we completely allowed all of our commodies to be over-valued.
B00005JM0B|5.0|This 2-disc DVD set is good. The motion picture is sharp and has surround sound. There's action, alot of special effects, and a little humor.  The special features tell the details of how the movie was made which has some humor in it and is very interesting.  Swarzeneggar said that he lifted weights for 3 months in preparation for this film so he'd look just as fit as he did in the other 2 Terminator movies. The actors tell what they had to do to prepare for their parts. It is told how the special effects were done.  This 2-disc DVD set might be worth buying.
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|It is just more than just enjoyable to watch TO GUN in HD, the quality is perfect!!!
B000G0O5N2|5.0|I have seen this movie numerous times, in cinema, on TV and now on Blu-ray. Because there are so many scenes that involve fighting at night and dawn, I knew it will be a good test to the Blu-ray DVD system I've just set up.  It did not disappoint me.  Sound effects and clarity are just great.  Really enjoy the movie with such a reasonable price.  The only downside is that the story is a bit depressive...but unfortunately that is something in real life that cannot be changed
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Lena Headey makes the series and Summer Glau adds a nice twist to the old terminator formula.  Well worth the price of this set definitely.
B000RZGIQ8|3.0|Top Gun was, and still is the benchmark for home theater viewing. I just recently updated my system with all high end components and new larger plasma screen tv.  Of course, the first thing I did was purchase Top Gun on Blue Ray. I guess since it was made so long ago, the video is somewhat limited as to how much better it could actually be. The audio is fantastic as ever.  Over all, there were a couple of spots where things seemed a bit clearer and made you feel more like you were actually part of it but over all, the upgrade from the original is marginal at best. Top Gun is still awesome, but the Blue Ray upgrade is just so so.
B0018SWA56|5.0|Emily Giffin is completely creative in her writing of this book, along with the other books in this series. After reading \\"Something Borrowed\\" and loving it, I was thrilled to start this second book. I was discouraged at the start because the book begins as essentially the same story as the previous book, just told from a different point of view. However, this was such a unique twist that it really gave the story an edge. After hearing the other side of the story told in the first book, the plot thickens and takes many unexpected turns. In \\"Something Borrowed\\" I really felt for the narrator and was appalled at the horrible things Darcy did. But in this second book, with Darcy as the narrator, you see the other side and begin to feel for Darcy. This book is a perfect example of how hearing both side of a story can make a world of a difference.    Giffin has a unique way of introducing new characters. The relationships between the characters and the way their personalities are described make you feel as if you are reading about some of your closest friends. The characters face real struggles and often find themselves in the strangest of situations. The best thing about them is that they are so relatable. Throughout all of Giffin's books, the characters evovle, disappear and come back into play in numerous and exciting ways. This always keeps things interesting and makes you want to continue reading.    Giffin's carefree writing style makes this book an easy read. The details and quirky characters pull you in and make you want more. This book, along with the others in the series make for great summer, beach reads. I would completely recommend reading her other books as well. If you love these characters then read on to see what happens. My one piece of advice is that with these books I think it is best to always expect the unexpected.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|Not bad, not great, a few good moments, some tedious ones, could have been better had a few more things been explained or a couple plot holes been tidied up. Overall not a film to spend too much time thinking about as opposed to just passively watching sans deep analysis, a thing which tends to erode the suspended disbelief needed to make I Am Legend work. Will Smith earned his paycheck here more convincingly as a soldier than as a scientist, but on the other hand the mutants he battled were one of the neater CGI foes to come along in a monk's age. I Am Legend hasn't lingered in my mind the way a truly good movie will but I recall being pleased enough when I first saw its story of one man and his loyal dog surviving in a disquietingly vacant post-epidemic Manhattan. So, your call here. If you like Will Smith movies, grim futures, recumbent humanity and cannibalistic mutants-cum-monsters, you'll probably enjoy I Am Legend. If you're one of those \\"I Am Analytical\\" sorts, well, maybe a more cerebral cinematic outing is your poison. Either way, go have some fun. Jeez, everybody seems so serious anymore!

B00192KCQ0|1.0|First of all Metallica really outdid themselves on Death Magnetic in more ways than one. The songs are a visit to the bands past with heavy guitar riffs and solos which had been lacking over recent years. The retail version of Death Magnetic is recorded too loud, and compressed beyond belief (and by me saying too loud, I am not referring to the volume which I listen to my music)! I love to CRANK the volume up and I simply can't do it with this cd without it sounding horrible. It sounds as if I blew my speakers with all the distorted high end mess. Sonically it takes away, and covers up the dynamics of the songs they worked so long and hard on over the past 3 years. Something interesting was discovered within a few days of this cd's release though. Some of the cd's were special versions that you paid more money for and you could get the songs for your Guitar Hero game. The funny thing was the SONGS SOUNDED BETTER ON THE GUITAR HERO 3 GAME! WHY! If you want to see for yourself how bad the sound actually is, check on youtube for Metallica and GH3 (guitar hero 3) versions. You can compare the different versions, and hold off until they re-release this thing, or make a remix remaster! It is too bad, because the music on this cd is pretty damn good!
B000Q9IZ5C|1.0|I hated this movie.  What had been a show about Mal and his crew became a movie, River the Reaver Slayer.  At the big fight scene, I wish everyone had died and just ended the stupid movie since to me Firefly was dead.  Yes there were a few good moments and some great lines but that was at the beginning of the movie.  Jayne (Adam Baldwin) was terrific as usual. I saw the movie at an advanced screening and refused to see it when it hit theaters and would never ever waste my money on it like I wasted my time seeing it.
B000H305U0|4.0|I think most people when they hear Justin they automatically think of NSYNC. That makes many people reserved if not uninterested in an album from Timberlake.<br /><br />However, that said I think that this album is able to be catchy without that tiring pop quality effect. As other reviewers have stated even if the songs are not an instant hit with you, the songs do grow on you after a while.<br /><br />There's not too many albums out there that you can listen from beginning to end without having to skip a majority of songs. The nice mixture of slow and up beat songs make for an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />I think a lot of people would be surprised to learn that Justin has grown musically.<br /><br />I'd tell anyone to give it a chance.
B0015AARJI|5.0|A very good controller, especially when you play MGS4, you can feel all emotions that the game generate.
B000002UB6|5.0|Easily the most disregarded album amongst the Beatles' body of work, Let it Be contains some of the bands best tracks, even if they were basically solo efforts.  Although it was recorded prior to Abbey Road, Let it Be sat shelved for about a year before it finally saw the light of day.  The story goes that Paul and John were belligerent with each other during the making of this album but that didn't seem to effect the quality of music that they were able to contribute together.  \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"Let it Be\\" stand up as two of the best tracks the group ever recorded, and \\"Two of Us\\" is one of the albums wonderful hidden gems.  Phil Spector's production has been criticized many times over because of his use of strings and his (many feel) innapropriate (for the Beatles) wall of sound.  However, most of the original music was unchanged.  It was clear by the time Let it Be hit stores, the Beatles were quite irritated by the restraints that the band was placing on them as individual musicians.  All of this being said, in no way do I consider Let it Be to be second-rate in any way when compared to other Beatles releases.  In fact, I consider it to be one of the greatest albums of the 1970s, which is no small feat, considering what a revolution in musical styles was soon approaching.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|The Best!!! Metallica is Metallica!!! Awesome album!! I have no words to describe how good it is!!!
B0002VKZL6|5.0|From an audiophile's or music lover's perspective, this one is a must have. I don't particularly care for country music, which this record does have the air of.. But the song writing and studio production are top-notch, as is the history of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits. On a personal note, I did spend the extra $$$ on the double vinyl set, which I was greatly disappointed with. The CD has much better charm, harmonic structure, and dynamics than the LP version, which is usually not the case with compact disk audio. I believe this is because the double LP is half-speed mastered. This process requires special equalization to keep the record compliant with RIAA standards. Too bad... So, don't bother with the LP. Buy the CD. The song lineup is very dynamic and has some interesting story lines. Like most good folk/country records, it's life set to music.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|This was a really good series, if you loved Babylon 5, and are not totally single visioned on Star Trek or Star Wars, this is a great series to get involved in.
B001AX9DT0|3.0|I have been a fan of Ray for a long time.  I was one of the first people to buy his first album and have a bunch of demos and live recordings.  I have seen him perform live asix times, and he is by far my favorite artist right now.<br /><br />This album is too highly produced.  Too many horns, too many strings, too much of everything.  Ray is best stripped down and raw.  Go see him live and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />His earlier music is more raw and passionate.  I don't know if Ethan Johns pushed him in this direction, or if Ray prefers this style, but I don't like it.<br /><br />\\"Henry Nearly Killed Me (It's A Shame)\\" is the best track by far.
0451197968|5.0|This was the first Bachman book I've read by Mr. King. I was just expecting it to be another SK book that followed most of his guidelines, and I was wrong by a long shot. This book was a lot more gritty and cruel than a lot of his other books. King doesn't beat around the bush when he writes as Bachman, he gets straight to the point. It was fast paced with a lot there to keep you turning the pages. The only complaint I have is that in the introduction of being Richard Bachman, King gives away the ending to the book for some stupid reason. Other than that, it was a great read. Highly recommended, especially because this was the only SK book I ever read that made me crack up on the last page (In a good way).
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have only done the Level 3 workout on this DVD (several times) and found it challenging but doable.  I just wish it was longer than 25 minutes!
B000ZIXGFS|4.0|Like their debut, also reviewed by me, I still argue that the band has room to grow. This second LP shows their maturity. The male and female vocals blend and twist around each other appealingly and sinously. The bass-and-drums combo can provide solid support that ranges from Zep-stomp to gentle balladry. While I predict their best music, luckily, will still be to come, this album as with their first one, grows on you.<br /><br />It's taken me a while to get the feel of it. Working with early 70s influences, adding most of all on \\"B[...]s,\\" the bonus disc's opening track, more of a Paisley Underground Opal- Rain Parade- Dream Syndicate mood crossed with a bit of Jesus & Mary Chain, the bridging of 1980s college radio's neo-psych with 70s classic rock makes for a clever mix. What I continue to find this Vancouver band's strongest element: the voices, and their layered production.<br /><br />On top of flute and harmonium, keyboards and processed effects, you can hear how the folkier, more wistful aura of West Coast late-60s sounds carries into the heavier delivery of more raunch and thunder. Yet, the band keeps the pace off-beat, and shifts the songs and their order on the album to stave off sameness. It's an intelligent record, not that commercial, yet not that obscure, and it deserves a wider audience.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Finally, some oldschool metal from the guys who help bring it out of the garages in the first place.  The only notable difference being that Hetfield actually learned how to sing while making crappy albums for a decade.  Plus, Trujillo sounds more like Cliff Burton than Newstead ever did; and Hammett seems to have regrown his cojones.

Working with early 70s influences, not only on the epic \\"Bright Lights,\\" but on the other tracks (and if you can find the limited edition bonus disc, there's more evidence on its first track) too you can hear the bridging of 1980s college radio's neo-psych with 70s classic rock. It makes for a clever mix. I'd like to hear the band, as with Oneida, expand into their own take on Krautrock and more space rock, as with Farflung.

B000Y9PILI|1.0|I was disappointed in this release. They changed everything around. The original feel is gone which is what really is important to keep during a restoration of any kind. Let's just talk about (Track 10) \\"CHICAGO\\".<br />They start off adding acoustic guitar to the first verse bullying out the Afuche Cabasa, tambourine and the organ. Let's add the lyrics \\"It's dying\\" again to make it sound like a mistake. Maybe it was edited out on the original who knows it did not work.<br />The song/album was perfect why F with it. \\"Songs for Beginners\\" is a terrific album I just wish that reissue studio remixers were taught a course in \\"Respect for Works of Art\\" during there training. Sorry Graham I hope it was not you that asked for these changes.<br /><br />GET THE ATLANTIC CD RELEASE (7204-2) and you will feel the songs again. The Atlantic CD has good sound quality and with some EQ tweaks on your system experience \\"Songs for Beginners\\" the best way so far.
031606792X|4.0|I wasn't a big fan of Twilight, but my daughter went on and on about it, so eventually she begged me to read it. No, I didn't fall in love with Edward. Frankly, I thought he was a bit \\"stalkerish\\" and played mind games with Bella (It's too dangerous for you to be around me, etc.). However, I read the other two in the trilogy and saw some redeeming qualities to Edward, although I'll never be a swooning Twilight mom.    What I found more interesting, as an author myself, was that I could see a growth in Stephenie. Her writing got better and while I still think she's overly in love with vampires and therefore makes them nearly flawless, at least the Cullens, when she does action, she is good.    This book blew me away with the fact that stuff that I thought she just threw into the first books were actually thought out and planned. It was easy for me to believe she wrote Twilight for fun, never expecting it would take off and then had to write more. No, apparently, she had it planned and it worked.    [...]    I do agree with one reviewer who said Bella's love didn't require any sacrifice. She got to keep Charlie, Jacob, Edward [...]    Life isn't that perfect, but you know, what? This isn't life. It's fantasy, so I'm willing to overlook this, even if it bugs me a little.    The last few scenes kept me reading, even when my husband wanted me to turn the light off so he could sleep!    I wish Steph had done more with the Volturi wives. It was mentioned over and over that \\"even the wives are coming!\\" and this was a BIG DEAL, and nothing was done with that. This is a big flaw in the book, in my opinion.    Over all, I think this was the best of the four, and I do wish she'd play a little more in this universe. I'd love to see what she'd do with some of the other vampires (the Amazons fascinate me) and what will happen with Renesmee in the future!
B000077VPU|2.0|When I purchased the product, I was expecting a full length concert but to my disappointment, lots of missing parts of it was not included in the DVD. Such as the performances of Def Leppard, Mertallica, Extreme, Guns n' Roses & other artists whom I know participated in the concert. I was not informed that the DVD I was purchasing during the time contains and limited to only selected concert performances.
0307269752|5.0|Very good book.  No dull parts.  Keeps you reading throughout.  Good character development.  I particularly liked Lisbeth.  She's very cool.  Great story.  I couldn't guess the ending.  I didn't know much about Sweden, so some of the names were hard for me.  Wasn't a big problem because the book was so good otherwise.  One of the best books I've read this year.  I understand it is the first of a trilogy, so I hope the other two come out pretty soon.  I definitely will read them too.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|This was the very first Dario Argento movie I've seen when I rented it a few years back! Needless to say it still blows me away.  This was indeed Dario at his best and truly focused.(Albeit thankfully not the last time,mind you) I mean what can I say you get a gripping story with a seemingly harmless(at first) Ballet/Boarding School,that ends up run by wicked satanic sorcerer(ess) types including a creepy spellbinding old crone named&#34;Elena Marcus!&#34; In general as nasty as the character Miss Tanner proved to be! That was a worthy performance! The soundtrack by Goblin was much like the movie in that it was creepy and atmospheric! Naturally I love the way that Dario uses stunning colorful lights with his reds,darkish blues and occasional yellows! Granted this movie didn't possess any groundbreaking/breakthrough special effects like Star Wars did in the same year this movie came out. But it does possess a look that can't be compared with anyone elses,it's quite atmospheric,stylistic, claustrophobic in most scenes, not at all predictable, full of suspense and horror/terror and best of all I get really excited at the end when the main character Suzy Bannion not only finds out that all the staff members of the ballet academy are against her and are satanic sorceressses but the race against time insued when Suzy meets the infamous Elena Marcus aka The Black Queen,aka The Directress aka Mater Suspiriorum. Anyhoo I also love the way that after valiantly defeating the &#34;old crone&#34; everything starts to explode and fall apart as the academy collaspes forcing Suzy to naturally get the hell out of there! The murder scenes possess a certain uniqueness to them as well. My most favorite ones would definitely be: The scene where the lovely Sarah is trying to block the door from whomever is after her and as she crawls out of the window inside the room she lands in this wirey materials(of which I like to refer to as &#34;The Slinkys of Death) that leave her perfectly immobile enough for the killer to victimize her, and the earlier scene where the escaped girl who tries to tell Suzy how to stop sorceresses first gets stabbed brutally then hanged to the point of crashing through the stain glass up above only to have its parts fall on her roommate was pretty unique! Other than that even though it was a brief cameo I was thrilled to see a younger Udo Kier(Johnny Mnemonic,Blade). Beyond that there's not much more I can say to truly do this movie justice 'cause it needs to be seen to be believed and indeed appreciated! All I will say is this movie is gorey and violent at times and features an unsettling yet thankfully brief scene of maggots falling from the ceiling. But for those who don't want to always follow the same conventions of an American or Canadian horror movie or just want an awesome and gripping murder mystery &#34;Well Look No Further! And remember despite it all &#34; You Can't Really Kill Elena Marcus! LOL!ile enough for the killer to victimize her, and the earlier scene where the escaped girl who tries to tell Suzy how to stop sorceresses first gets stabbed brutally then hanged to the point of crashing through the stain glass up above only to have its parts fall on her roommate was pretty unique!

B001BKG9SK|5.0|This is a great addition to anyones Pink Floyd/Gilmour collection. This performanace I felt Breaks from the Pink Floyd type that everyone expects to see but that does not detract from the performance. If there is one down side to the performance is there is no female back ground. David has always enhanced His and Floyds music with some of the most beautiful female voices and in this one he fails to do so. Richard Wright does a fabulous performance on Comfortably Numb. This is a must for your collection.  John, Parker Colorado

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Batman Begins is a great reboot for the Batman franchise.  After the failure of Batman and Robin, Chris Nolan explores the Batman character in a real-world setting.    This movie still feels like a classic comic book origin, but it's also different from all the others at the same time.  This film does a great job of not just leading into the Dark Knight, but being a stand-alone film too.

B000J3OTSM|4.0|The dancing is awesome ,the customs and characters are well   done and adecuated.  The story is forgetable and it gets in the way of the amazing dancing moves sometimes  Some of the music could have been better but still a great movie to own.  Great moves.Great actors.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Sleeping Beauty, the classic tale, looks better than ever in this blu-ray version. As a bonus I was quite surprised to find a DVD version also included in this package. You really cannot go wrong with this title on blu-ray especially since they are including the DVD version on a seperate disc. It's simply a must-have title.
B0012QCZ54|4.0|Good acting,great music and excellent dancing.  Amazing feats to be able to make some of the moves.  The story is kind of predictable and lacking imagination leaving us wanting to know more about some of the characters.  The great acting abilities of Channing Tatum were sadly wasted because of the flimsy story so poorly written and simplistic.  Customs are very effective and well done as well as the choreography.  Buy it for the great dancing because West Side Story it isn´t.  I still enjoyed it a lot.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I told myself I wasn't going to get this but when I saw it in the store I couldn't help myself and had to get it. Yes, it was a bit pricey, but I plan to see if I can't recoop a couple bucks by selling my DVD versions of the three films. Also included in this is another disc with the Animatrix on it, which I have seen in the past, but do not own, which should look pretty great on blu-ray and 35 hours of bonus footage which I haven't looked at yet but if it has anything to do with the creation of the special effect it should be pretty good as far as extras go.
0385751532|4.0|Its not Harry Potter, its comes close to showing a personal side like Jason Steed adn its not as much fun as Alex Rider, but its worth a read. Poorly written or unedited, but uts raw and a good book for young and old.  We or I have been spoilt, I read the Harry Potter books, I read the Alex Rider books and I have just finished Jason Steed, so anything else as alot to live up to. It may disturb some younger readers, but it also informs them of what life was like during the holocaust and through a childs eyes. Its well worth the 4 hours it took to read.
B001BPJJ82|4.0|I picked this up because the cover attracted me, quite honsetly and I found myself captivated by the story and GORGEOUS landscapes and imagery depicted in this film. The movie is a little wierd and the story does jump around a lot but that was part of the appeal to me. I did not find it hard to follow the jumps it made but some might. I reccommend this if you enjoy fantasy/storytales, or if you just want to look at tasty visuals on your blu-ray HDTV setup while being entertained by a story like you've never seen before.

B00005KK1A|3.0|They say 2nd albums usually fall short, and Burnin' is no exception to that. Yes, it has merit, songs like Get Up-Stand Up, I Shot the Sheriff, and Burnin' and Lootin' definitely stand out as Wailer classics and the album sure has that warm original Wailer's sound (good mastering), but besides these songs the rest of the repertory is so so. At the end, the album as a whole did not surpass their debut album Catch A Fire nor did it surpass many of Bob's records after it.    The forte of the first album was the variety of emotional melodies and its accentuated instrumentality (as far as root-reggae for 1973). In this one, the recurrence to rhythmic formulas starts to become present, the sound was more simplistic. In reality, Bob Marley and the Wailers never again did an album with such caliber as Catch A Fire. But for me successive albums like Exodus, Kaya, and surely Babylon By Bus are definitely before this one.
1933784032|5.0|[[VIDEOID:27915971]]Fans of Star Wars, particularly model collectors will love this book. This book is however not a book featuring collectibles. This is a compilation of hundreds of photos models of ships and sets that were used throughout the Star Wars movies.<br /><br />There are four main chapters: 1. Starships, 2. Vehicles, 3. Creatures, droids and sculpts, 4. Environment.<br /><br />The photos included are extremely high quality and many are close ups for details. The level of detail and workmanship is amazing when you're looking at it close up. I can also touch them.<br /><br />Fans will find almost everything, from the Imperial Star Destroyer, Padme Amidala's Apartment, Holographic Chess Game, just to name a few.<br /><br />If you've been to Star Wars exhibitions, you'll know that photography isn't allowed. Well, this book is the next best thing to the exhibition. Wait a minute -- so that's why photography isn't allowed.<br /><br />This is a well constructed hard covered book with great binding and high quality semi gloss paper.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

B00006YXOX|3.0|...I love Jochum and I know many rate this set highly but I find it generally okay and typically straighforward.<br /><br />Of course there are many very interesting moments and occasional special insights, but overall I find that it is not as inspired as his later EMI Staatskapelle Dresden set...which is uncontrollably passionate, dramatic, and spiritually prophetic.<br /><br />If anything, it makes an excellent starter set...but you'll want to invest in his EMI without question...now re-issued on the Brilliant Classics label!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|A solid record for Metallica.  Definitley a throwback to the older material of \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"And Justice for All.\\"  The songs are long, but relatively cohesive with plenty of old school riffing to satisfy fans.    Sonically, however, this record is terrible.  The sound extermely over compressed.  There has been some attention paid to this in te press, and the practical reality for me is that a lot of nuance is lost along with the sound dynamics.  In addition, I tend to get listening fatigue after a longer period of listening.  It's a shame.    Sadly this is just another chapter in the uneven recording history of Metallica.  (Go ahead and relisten to \\"And Justice for All\\" and relaize again how much you miss the bass.  \\"St. Anger\\" does not even deserve a mention...) I rated this album 3 stars out of 5, or maybe a 6.5 or 7 out of ten.  If it was maastered properly it would probably be an 8 for me.
B0000DD79B|5.0|These days, I have way too many CD's on my \\"to buy\\" list and not enough money to go around.

That's exactly what you'll find in \\"The Essential Simon & Garfunkel.\\"  Not only does it have all their greatest hits, but the collection spans two discs, so you're sure to get enough of their music to get your fill.
0452270073|1.0|Sorry, but I can't see what this superficial fictional treatment added to the already rich mix of Sassoon's own (internally inconsistent, or just honestly perspectivist?) memoirs and Max Egremont's probing, nuanced telling in his biography of Sassoon. The sharpness and humanity of Egremont's insights make this novel seem banal by comparison.

B001641ZFS|5.0|I am a big fan of this violinst . I purchased almost all of his recordings from Amazon. I also purchased his earlier recording of exact composition. This new recrding is exatly I would like to hear Mozart....with personality of a Baroque player. The old recording with another conductor was not very good...dead and boring. In contrast, this recording is colorful, alive and happy. In addition, the recording technology probably is better in the new one (subject of this review)    The sound is clear and the style is conversational. My husband does like it saying that the violinst is not playing the Ramanitc style that Mozart intended, but I like Mozart Barouque style better.
B001CD6FKS|3.0|I haven't watched all that many episodes of the popular Japanese animated series \\"Speed Racer\\", upon which the famed writer/director team known as the Wachowski brothers based their newest movie. So, when this live-action version of the series debuted in theaters earlier in 2008, I wasn't all that excited to see it. To me it looked cheesy, childish, and generally uninteresting; although I always thought the visual effects looked impressive, as well they should coming from the creators of \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy. With that being said, \\"Speed Racer\\" has recently arrived on DVD and Blu-ray, and I figured I'd eventually get around to watching it, mostly to see the visual effects. Suffice it to say, I did finally rent the movie, and even though I went in with very low expectations after reading all the negative reviews it received, I have to say \\"Speed Racer\\" actually wasn't the horrible disaster of a movie that I was expecting to see.    \\"Speed Racer\\" follows an up-and-coming race car driver named Speed (Emile Hirsch), who along with the support of Mom and Pops Racer (Susan Sarandon and John Goodman), is taking the professional racing circuit by storm in his lightning quick Mach 5. However, just as Speed is beginning to make a name for himself in racing, the corruption of this world quickly tries to topple this wholesome family, and without the additional aid of his girlfriend Trixie (Christina Ricci) and the ninja-like prowess of Racer X (Matthew Fox), Speed and the entire Racer family may lose more than just the sport they love.    I know someone could make the argument that when a person goes into a movie with low expectations it wouldn't take much for the movie to actually seem impressive to that viewer. And this is true, and I wondered if that was the case here, because I didn't want my opinion affected by my previous bias towards the film. So, after I thought about it for a little bit, I feel I can honestly say that I actually found \\"Speed Racer\\" to be moderately enjoyable, regardless of what my initial thoughts had been. It's not the perfect movie, not by any means, but it does provide some very entertaining and visually impressive racing sequences that have not been seen before in movies; and it was kind of nice to have a movie that was essentially safe for the entire family to watch, which is something of a rarity these days.    The screenplay written by Larry and Andy Wachowski, who also directed the movie, is for the most part very straightforward and simplistic, which is absolutely perfect for the kind of movie this is. The characters are clearly defined as to who is good and who is bad, making it easy for children to know who to root for; and the morality on display is quite obvious, but without becoming too heavy-handed as to take away from the overall story. Basically, this movie's story is geared specifically towards kids, or those that are hardcore fans of the animated series, so all other moviegoers should just sit back, relax, and turn their brains off because for the most part you won't really need it on.    However, approximately 75% of the way through the movie, the Wachowski's attempt to throw in some plot twists and betrayals, causing the story to become a bit more complicated than it initially had been. The problem with complicating this movie's story is that for most adult members of the audience who were not fans of the series, and therefore, have been able to just enjoy the movie for the piece of fluff that it is; we now have to re-engage our brains to tag along for the plot twists. When this occurs, at least in my case, it also allowed me time to begin analyzing what I had been watching, and before too long I started to notice little problems I had with various aspects of the movie. The problems I had were nothing too big to cause the movie to flop in my eyes, but merely annoyances that I had noticed when they occurred but had dismissed because the movie was still kind of fun and very fast-moving so I didn't have a whole lot of time to dwell upon them. But, when the Wachowski's introduced some plot twists, and attempted to throw in some drama for good measure, the movie kind of slowed down, which felt really odd being that the movie was a mere 30 minutes from conclusion; thus allowing me a moment to reflect. In my opinion, \\"Speed Racer\\" would have been a much better movie experience had the Wachowski's simply ignored their penchant for over-complicating things, so that this movie could have remained the simple kids' movie it started out as. Instead, it wound up being just an average movie that will most likely be forgotten over time by all who've seen it, when it could have been a classic for many kids to enjoy for years to come.    The cast of \\"Speed Racer\\" is a decent ensemble line-up with rising star Emile Hirsch (\\"The Girl Next Door\\") in the lead as Speed. Emile does a good job of making this two-dimensional cartoon character feel just a little bit more real to the audience. His performance is nothing stellar, but neither is anyone else's in this movie. I find it strange that for all the over-complicating the Wachowski's tried to do with this movie, they could have at least thrown in a little bit of character development for the actors and actresses to dig into. Is that too much to ask? I guess so. Alongside Emile we have veteran actors John Goodman (\\"Death Sentence\\") and Susan Sarandon (\\"The Client\\") as Speed's parents. Both give good performances, although I thought Susan was maybe phoning it in a little bit in places. Rounding out the cast we have Christina Ricci (\\"Sleepy Hollow\\") and Matthew Fox (\\"We Are Marshall\\"). Christina portrays Speed's girlfriend Trixie, a role that could probably be called her most sweet and innocent to date. Typically, Christina plays much more complicated or troubled characters, but she handled the uncomplicated and uncompromising Trixie surprisingly well, even to the point of being cute in a few instances. Matthew Fox as the mysterious Racer X was probably given the least to do out of the entire cast, but I imagine he signed on to this movie for the same reason as all the other members of the cast, a chance to work with the creators of \\"The Matrix\\". I mean, seriously who's going to pass up an opportunity like that? Even though Matthew wasn't given much more to do than just fight as Racer X, it was clear in the little screen time that he did have that he was obviously having a good time.    From a visual effects standpoint, \\"Speed Racer\\" is one of the most mind-blowing experiences you can have at the movies. Almost every single special effect is amazing, as the Wachowski's create their hyper-reality or whatever you would call the world of this movie. As awesome as most of the special effects were, there were a few moments I found to be weak spots, and I don't know if this was intentional or not. One particular moment dealt with a chase sequence involving a semi truck that seemed unfinished and looked far too fake, even for this kind of movie. The other complaint I had regarding the visual effects, and I know this one was intentional, was when the characters would be viewed from the side for a kind of side-scrolling action sequence; which I presume was meant to resemble the classic anime of the animated series. To me these few moments were utterly pointless and felt out of place in a movie with essentially top-notch visual effects. I'm sure some of the fans of the series loved these moments, but they weren't for me and I wish they would have been left out of the film.    Overall, \\"Speed Racer\\" is a fairly entertaining movie, it's not the best thing you'll ever watch, nor does it strive to be. Even so, it will provide you with a two hour escape from the real world, and some good old fashioned family fun that is at least worth seeing once, but probably not much more than that.    \\"Speed Racer\\" is rated PG for violence and brief language.

I found the content to inspire me to create a unique and brilliant Presentation, not just a Presentation. This book is also concise, well constructed to easily navigate through the parts of particular interest, and it touches on \\"flashes of genious\\"-- certain examples of great work.  The inclusion of a woman's successful Presentation (the brain doctor) because of a conscious decision to use very few Slides points to this book as a Visionary book. It is not a 'how-to' book but a \\"think about this\\" type of book. It was also very beautifully laid out. The attention to every design detail was remarkable and it has become a book I recommend to everyone trying to understand the communicative concepts behind any type of Presentation-- from a business one to one more along the lines of theatre or spectacle-- because those are the Presentation of Ideas too-- albeit emotional ones. I call this an Art Book on presentations.[[ASIN:B0015KLHFG FAUST]]
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This collection is a must-have for any fan of the ubber popular show, The Gilmore Girls.  It is a great re-packaging job, a spacesaver if you will, with a \\"book\\" for each season with full length pictures of cast, some of which were not shown if each season was bought individually and a complete Gilmoreisms booklet.  The carrying case itself has a magnetic feature that keeps the opening closed without effort.  I appreciate how they place each disc within a \\"book\\" or season in an indented slot rather than just a sleeve opening as this detail cuts down on scratches.  Also, each disc has a number decal so you don't have to wonder or squint if searching for where you had last left off on the viewing.  This item is well worth the money if your seperate seasons are starting to malfunction due to constant viewing or if you are looking for that perfect gift for the Gilmore Girls fan in your life.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather is a fantastic movie for anyone who likes a good action/drama/Mob movie. This movie always ends up in the top 10 of an all time list.  The 2nd and 3rd installment are good too, with the 3rd the weakest of the 3.  This Blu-Ray version is fantastic video and audio quality.  Now some may feal the first film is \\"grainy\\" and this is actualy by design.  Coppola wanted this grity, grainy feal to the movie so dont' think the blu-ray is defective.  It is still, by far, the sharpest and cleanest version you will ever see.  This is not like the TV version Coppola cut before, it is the original theatrical version with full cut.  If you have not seen this before, it is a must own.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the grain, I own the SD-DVD version and this one is much cleaner in many scenes.  However, some scenes are in fact very similar.  This probably has to do with the quality of the original film used to convert.  That said, I seriously doubt that there will EVER be a cleaner version of this movie then the Blu-Ray<br /><br />The audio is also fantastic.<br /><br />Again, this is a must own for any movie buff.  Enjoy!
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I have listened to Keane's new album \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" several times and I have to say I'm really impressed. I am a huge fan of their first album \\"Hopes and Fears\\", and, with the exception of the title track, the new album is an entirely different beast. In this case, different is really good. The music is well-crafted and the lyrics are some of Tim's best. The opening track \\"Spiralling\\" is musically upbeat but the lyrics cast a shadow over the sunny music. Much of the album is lyrically dark belying the uptempo music, but there are moments where hope shines through. I really like the tracks \\"Perfect Symmetry\\"(which would have been perfectly at home on the \\"Hopes and Fears\\" album) and \\"Black Burning Heart\\" ,but the entire album is worthy of repeated listens.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|The Sex and the City movie is heart-warming and an enjoyable watch, however, it is no where near as good as the series. The women have magically all turned into billionaires, the cheesy scenes have taken over the comic realness that the series provided and the movie is a little too predictable. That being said, I still love the four women, even if the movies a bit of a let down.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I have to admit that as eager as I was to see another installment of Indiana Jones, the word \\"aliens\\" made me ambivalent. Indy, after all, is an archaeologist. His area of expertise is the past, not the futuristic. He looks for relics, not flying saucers! But in the end, I loved this movie and couldn't wait for the DVD. I do hope there will be another installment in Indy's adventures!<br /><br />I fail to understand the hoopla regarding Harrison Ford's age. He's still the best action hero Hollywood has to offer. Frankly, he looks pretty darn good to me--I'd be happy to have him rescue me any day. In fact, if he'll promise to show up, I'll go tie myself to the railroad tracks right now!<br /><br />I was also glad to see Karen Allen return as Marion Ravenwood. Of all of Indy's leading ladies, Marion was the only one who really seemed a match for him. Willie in \\"Temple of Doom\\" was too much of a wuss and Ilsa in \\"Last Crusade\\" was a Nazi. That relationship would never have worked out.<br /><br />The dialogue between Ford and Allen is wonderful. Blanchette was a little over-the-top as the Russian villain. Hurt was a terrific looney.<br /><br />Indy, Marion and Mutt sure ain't the typical '50s \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" sort of family...but they're a whole lot more interesting!
B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  I couldn't stop thinking about the end of this film for days, it deeply toched me.  The acting, story, setting and plot were flawlessly done.  You do have to watch it a second time to really pick up on everything...so much happens in the dialogue, unless you are really paying attention the first time through, you miss some of the key moments.    Anyone comparing this film to \\"the illusionist\\" is really missing the boat.  Other the fact the two movies have magicians in them, that's about it.  The illusionist is a bit of a joke compared to this film.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Because \\"I Am Legend\\" departs from the zombie formula of its predecessors is the reason it surpasses the others. Invasion, Body Snatchers, Omega Man, and the like thrill with fear. Legend takes the story to a personal level, one man's hopeless battle to survive and give hope for the world. Will gives a moving performance that stays with you. It's on the basis of memorable story and images that Legend is far more resonant than most movies I've ever seen. I love the Bob Marley tie in, having hope when life is at its bleakest. A standout movie that thrills and dares to depth.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Not thier best but certainly a stepp back towards their former Master of Puppets, style. It also has the flavor of 2008 and not a total revisitation of old trends.
0375703764|3.0|too much style, too little substance. the story of the house lured me in and propelled me through to the conclusion but most of the book was filler. the excessive footnotes were distracting and annoying and added little or nothing at all to the story. as i was having to turn the book upside down and sideways and very nearly bending over backwards to read some pages, i pictured danielewski grinning with delight at the headache and neck strain he'd caused me on account of his being so gosh darn clever! all of this over-complication and assault of useless words made me grow more and more detached from the plot and the characters until i just wanted the damn book to end. my irritation level elevated to the point that i was even annoyed by the pages with almost NO WORDS. \\"waste of trees\\" comes to mind. i appreciate the effort that it took to do something different but not the effort that it required to drudge through most of it. i would recommend reading \\"tom's story\\" and \\"the three attic whalestoe institute letters\\" and then picking up a new book.

0061148512|5.0|Admitting that you love this book is a bit like doing same about a train wreck, in this case the tragedy being Sylvia Plath's startling real-life spiral towards suicide. Well, then...guilty as charged. I enjoyed this book from its beginning \\"It was a queer, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs...\\" through to the bitter end. Early on, she declares, (p 2) \\"I was supposed to be having the time of my life.\\" Esther Greenwood and eleven other young ladies (p 3) \\"had all won a fashion magazine contest, by writing essays and stories and poems and fashion blurbs, and as prizes they gave us jobs in New York for a month, expenses paid, and piles and piles of free bonuses, like ballet tickets and passes to fashion shows...\\" Unfortunately, instead of elation and excitement at such an opportunity, of it, she writes (p 3) \\"I felt very still and very empty, the way the eye of a tornado must feel, moving dully along in the middle of the surrounding hullabaloo.\\"<br /><br />The Bell Jar follows her experiences as an intern in NYC during the early 1950s, college life (dating, avoiding her TB afflicted boyfriend, trying to lose her virginity), and mental decline, including time spent in a psych ward for electroshock therapy. This semi-autobiographical novel, filled with telling statements about her mental state; (p 71) \\"I was only truly happy until I was nine years old,\\" (p 15) \\"I felt like a hole in the ground,\\" (p 57) \\"I felt dull and flat and full of shattered visions,\\" (p 81) \\"I began to think maybe it was true that when you were married and had children it was like being brainwashed, and afterwards you went about numb as a slave in some private, totalitarian state,\\" (p 109) \\"A summer calm laid its soothing hand over everything, like death,\\" and (p 151) \\"If you were going to kill yourself, how would you do it?\\" is a terrific, telling trip down lunacy lane. Also good: Girl Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken Kesey, and A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar.by Sylvia Nasar.
0525478183|5.0|In Orlando they have been next door neighbors for a decade and even saw a corpse together when they were nine years old.  However, as they get ready to graduate from high school, Quentin Jacobsen still loves his childhood best friend, Margo Roth Spiegelman, but she moved on to spend time with the cool dudes and he settled for other girls.  She became the centerfold for the bad girl and him the nerdy smart guy.<br /><br />One night she suddenly appears at his bedroom window like she used to do when they were preadolescents.  He sneaks out so he does not have to explain to his therapist parents what he is doing and they spend the night on her capers.<br /><br />The next day Q learns Margo vanished from his life again, but this time she is not even in the neighborhood.  Fearing for her going so far as considering she committed suicide, he needs to know if she is okay.  With his best friend Radar as his sidekick they follow the clues starting with Margo's copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass.<br /><br />This is a deep teenage relationship drama with several incredible twists to the connection between the lead couple.  Q and Radar's inquiry is fun to follow as the hero begins to understand the murkiness of love which ironically means not to understand.  Along with their sidekick Ben of bleeding masturbation infamy, they make an awesome geek trio while Margo is the fascinating polar opposite as the glamorous bad girl.  Fans will enjoy this fine teen mystery as any moment this reviewer expected Alvy Singer to crash across the fourth wall from Annie Hall bringing Marshall McLuhan with him to resolve the amusing psychobabble.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B00168HARG|4.0|At the Amazon price, this is a great value.  I enjoyed watching the entire first year series without interruption and picked up on some things I had missed.  Not much in the way of extras, but that was okay with me.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I really enjoyned Masterpeiece Theatre's Northanger Abbey.  I loved the way they captured Catherine's dramtic imagination, and they really caught the horribleness of John Thorpe and his sister Isabella.  The actor who played John Thorpe was not good looking either.  So there is no way you could possible like this person. He played his part well.  At first I wasn't sure if I liked the actor who played Henry Tilney, but he was such a good actor that his looks grew on you and you really ended up liking him.<br /><br />Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and felt it stayed true to Jane Austin's version of the story \\"Northanger Abby\\"

B001CZJKS0|1.0|OK, I LOVE Halloween, it remains to this day as one of my favorite movies to date. I have both the 1978 and 2007 versions. I have the latest DVD of the 1978 version, and I am happy enough with that one as it is. But this set it $70 for something you already own as well as not H2 but 4 and 5. C'mon, Mr. Carpenter. I already own a DVD of your classic horror masterpiece, I DON'T NEED ANOTHER ONE. You're becoming just as bad as George Lucas and the Star Wars movies. Simply put, this doesn't bring ANYTHING new to the table. It's just another case of Anchor Bay going through the motions because it's time to make more $$$ again. Quite frankly, if you already own the movie, you don't need to buy this.

B00005JPO1|5.0|I was only 4 years old when the last Indiana Jones movie came out, and since then I have loved watching every minute of the first three.  Watching this, knowing critics did not like it, I was still so excited.      The movie has some parts that do seem outdated with some of the technologies available they were still doing basic filming, but then again, that's what made IJ great so many years ago.  The story reunites Marion Ravenwood with long lost lover, Indy Jones.  What a great pair.  Shia LaBeouf actually does a great job, obviously being the next in line for the indy movies.      All in all, pretty solid story.  Russians trying to control the world...with mind power...from aliens...  I can see why some people panned this movie so hard, but watching it is good ole fun.  For past Indiana Jones fans, this is just another chapter.
9562911640|5.0|This is one of the most powerful books ever written for those seeking to increase or find... both mental and spiritual power. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest books ever written for those in search of self development and spiritual growth. This is not a novel... it is a course for self development and spiritual power. I will be forever grateful to Chalres Haanel for the knowledge he has givem to me and mankind in this blessed work. Buy it (while you can), if you are not ready for it now, keep it, until you are in the right spiritual frame of mind.. to understand it.
B0000019PA|5.0|Greatest Album of All TIME.  this album is simply the best album I've ever listened to.  I have listened to it once a week for a few years now and don't plan on stopping.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Rick Rubin's production is atrocious!  I guess the entire music market is going to MP3 downloads where all the levels being the same is the best for digital compression.  However, the album sounds horrible - the sounds clips the speakers constantly.  Definitely needs a serious remix from the original master tapes/recordings.
B001IL4ZVA|5.0|I'm woefully behind in watching the great Universal monster flicks (something I am going to rectify pronto), but even still, I really love this episode! The black and white film stock, the Bernard Hermann/Franz Waxman-esque soundtrack, the opening credits which look like something straight out of a 1930s monster movie, the old-style iris-outs and wipe dissolves (even a shot that's a clear mimic of the camera 360-ing around Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak's kiss in \\"Vertigo\\"), the atmospheric lighting and playfully cheezy sets -- splendid! The only thing missing is an angry mob with torches, but it would be hard to fit something like that into the tightly-woven narrative. It's more than a deliberately corny episode, the writing is still top-drawer and the character development is still at its peak. We even get to hear the monster's angle on what it feels like to be the monster, and why it sought to take control of things in such a gruesome way.<br /><br />Oh, and the shot of Jensen Ackles in lederhosen: too cute for words!

B001ILFUDM|5.0|For years, the only available edition of Disney's classic \\"Pinocchio\\" has been a bare-bones movie-only version with no extras at all. Practically every other animated film in the Disney vault has been released in special 2-disc editions. Now, this has been fixed with this Platinum Edition on Blu-ray/DVD. Released in 1940, \\"Pinocchio\\" was the 2nd animated feature, following the release of \\"Snow White.\\" It also introduced the Oscar winning song, \\"When You Wish Upon a Star,\\" which is one of the most memorable Disney songs ever.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, it involves a wooden puppet, Pinocchio, created by lonely Gepetto the woodcarver. The Blue Fairy grants his wish of making the puppet alive, however, he can only become a real boy if he proves himself \\"brave, truthful, and unselfish.\\" Assigned the character Jiminy Cricket as his conscience, Pinocchio begins his adventures to become a real boy. Without giving away too much of the plot, one of my favorite sequences is the one involving Pleasure Island. It would not be too difficult today to draw parallels to what happens to people when they get attracted to dangerous short-term pleasures that mask a life of imprisonment. Although the movie dips into some dark territory, obviously Disney brings it back to happier ground, showing the power of true love (albeit not a romantic one this time). Cliff Edwards brings Jiminy Crickett to life with his expressive vocal talents, and few can equal his singing of the classic \\"Wish Upon A Star\\" song in his trademark falsetto. Little known trivia: the voice of the Blue Fairy is actress Evelyn Venable, who played Shirley Temple's mother in \\"The Little Colonel\\" (1935).<br /><br />The video on this will blow you away; the level of detail is just incredible...and the picture is clean as a whistle. Color are vibrant and practically leap off the screen; this has caused some issues with so-called purists who claim that the restoration is TOO vibrant and not what was originally intended. This could be, but personally, watching this on Blu-ray AND DVD was amazing. No complaints here. The audio is crisp and clear...hard to imagine that this movie is 69 years old. Wow!!!<br /><br />Here are the INCREDIBLE bonus features:<br /><br />DISC ONE<br /><br />* Pinocchio's Matter of Facts: Fun facts about Pinocchio and other related subjects as you watch the movie<br /><br />* Audio Commentary: Leonard Maltin, Eric Goldberg and J. B. Kaufman<br /><br />* Disney Song Selection: Sing along with favorite songs as the lyrics appear onscreen<br /><br />DISC TWO<br /><br />BACKSTAGE DISNEY--<br /><br />* \\"No Strings Attached: The Making of Pinocchio.\\" (55:88) Fantastic in-depth feature that covers almost every detail. Casting is covered (including interviews with Dickie Jones, the voice of Pinocchio), and shows just how much the voices added as well as the live-action reference actors. Special credit goes to Cliff Edwards, the extremely memorable voice of Jiminy Cricket. This feature details how \\"Pinocchio\\" was the first feature after \\"Snow White.\\" The animators had great confidence after \\"Snow\\" and were looking to expand their horizons even more with \\"Pinocchio.\\" Technically, this movie shows the animators at the top of their game; watching the multi-plane camera shots is breathtaking.<br /><br />* 2 Deleted Scenes & Alternate Ending (10:23) with intro (:57): All of these are shown in storyboard form. \\"The Story of the Grandfather Tree\\" (3:17)-Geppetto tells Pinocchio about the Great Pine Tree from which he (Pinocchio) is descended. \\"In The Belly Of The Whale\\" (4:14)-The most elaborate of Pinocchio's deleted scenes that remains in the Disney Archives, these recently discovered storyboards reveal a different version of Geppetto inside Monstro. Alternate Ending (1:53): A recently uncovered set of small storyboard panels reveal plans for a different version of Pinocchio becoming a real boy.<br /><br />* The Sweat Box (6:24): The Sweatbox was a small projection room at the Disney studio where Walt critiqued story reels, rough animation, and dailies of films in progress with his anxious artists.  This piece traces the history of the Sweatbox and brings to life this important part of Walt Disney's artistic process. Using reenactments for the action and the actual conversations (a stenographer copied these down and they still exist), you can feel a part of the creation process as Walt critiques the pencil tests. Although harsh at times, animators today say that Walt was usually spot-on in his critiques. Very little of the footage in \\"Pinocchio\\" is seen as originally intended; with the sweatbox, each sequence was worked and re-worked to perfection.<br /><br />* Live Action Reference Footage (9:58). This is absolutely fascinating. Not only do you get to see some of the reference footage, you see and hear (through a current narration) how the animators actually used this footage. Apparently, Walt was not happy with the original actor for the live-footage of Jiminy Cricket, as a 2nd one was brought in. And for those who scoff at the live-action as a means to simply trace...not so...animators tell how doing a straight tracing job ends up looking stiff. Much care was put into each drawing to make them appear alive and fluid.<br /><br />* Pinocchio Art Galleries<br /><br />* Deleted Song: \\"Honest John\\" is a 1947 promotional recording of a song not used in the film.<br /><br />* Gepettos: Then & Now: This featurette chronicles toymaking, with a number of fascinating interviews. Cyril Hobbins is a toymaker in England who carves traditional toys from wood still. Lenka Pavlickova is from Prague, and she shows her realistic wood-carved marionettes. As she tells here, puppets help overcome cultural and language barriers. Naturally, as they cover the modern-day toys, there is a plug for the Ultimate Wall-E toy, described by Chris Heatherly, VP Technology & Innovation for Disney \\"Toy-morrow.\\" This Wall-E figure has been created to be as life-like as possible and reacts to the human voice. Extremely impressive! Not so impressive is the Japanese robot, I-Sobot, described by Kimitaka Watanabe, GM of Future Toys. There is nothing loveable about this figure.<br /><br />ACTIVITIES & GAMES: These are well-done in the animation department, but unless you have a ton of time on your hands...<br /><br />* Pinocchio Puzzles: Hosted by Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's Puzzles is a multi-tiered puzzle game that contains six unique wooden puzzles for the viewer to assemble by clicking on the right puzzle piece.

0439023483|5.0|One of the Best books I've read since the Twilight saga, I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the sequel Catching Fire in 9/09.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|My whole family loved this film and I think they did a great job bringing it out of the cartoon world.
B00005JPO1|5.0|I and my daughter really enjoyed this movie.  We've been waiting a long time, and playing the Lego Indiana Jones while we waited, which didn't spoil the flick a bit.  I am shocked that Harrison Ford can still do the stunts, and well!  My daughter hasn't seen the original three, but I think she's a fan now :)  It was really satisfying to see the ending [which I won't spoil for those of you who haven't seen this movie yet].  Now, if they'll just get together and make another Star Wars, we can cheer again!!  I'm hoping for more after this one.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, Indiana Jones is an archaeologist who teaches at a university that finances his searches for antiquities. The search usually means danger with a lot of funny lines during the action.  Harrison Ford, who plays Indy, also played Han Solo in the six Star Wars flicks.  Both the Indiana Jones series and the Star Wars series are meant to bring back the shoot-em-up action with defined heroes and villains popular in the 1940's.  I find the genre refreshing, and feel good about sharing it with my grown daughter.  I recommend that PG-13's only be shared with the 13 and older crowd.  There was one scene I couldn't watch, but I had plenty of cues to turn away [dramatic music, violence that gradually progressed].<br /><br />We would be happier if special effects weren't QUITE so realistic, but that's us [and we feel that way about EVERY movie we watch].  This movie is a wild, fun ride from start to finish and I enjoy the humor very much.  By the way, I thought it was fun to include a science fiction tie in, which Steven Spielberg didn't want in it anyway!
B000B8QG22|5.0|Great movie!
B000UNYJV8|4.0|A very earnest look at the skinhead culture of 1980's England, This is England is a well acted and for the most part well written film.  A young boy living with his recently widowed Mom is befriended by a group of fairly benign older kids who are marginally into the skinhead scene. There is an actual warmth about the way they take the younger kid in and get him the clothes and the haircut that helps him fit in. They seem like a likable enough and relatively harmless bunch guilty of nothing more than some vandalism.<br />The film takes a decidedly ugly turn when a former neighborhood leader returns from prison and the group splits into 2. From that point on the inevitable descent from racist posturing to actual violence is quick and brutally depicted.<br />A very well done film on many levels and the actors, none of whom I had seen before , are uniformly believable and realistic.

6302470021|5.0|This is in many ways not a very good movie. You have probably heard about how the movie was an absurd thing to begin with (five directors?) and how it blew up in production, and was pretty much thrown together.    Nonetheless, it's one of my favorite movies ever. I rarely watch a movie more than once, and I'm drawn to watch this from time to time. It's absurd, silly, and serious all at the same time. The first time you see it, your reaction is going to be more \\"Huh?\\" than \\"Wow!\\" but it sticks with you. A week later you'll laugh at something you remember. A month later, you'll remember something and grin. The next time you see a \\"serious\\" Bond movie, you'll think of some twist in it that was done much better in Casino Royale. After you've safely forgotten it, you'll be reminded of it and -have- to see it again.    It's both truly mediocre and one of the best movies ever made. I have no idea why it's so compelling, but it is.

B00006G8K0|4.0|In the 1950s, the classic horror monsters of old had been abandoned in favor of the more trendy atomic monsters. Most of these new monsters were giant bugs or lizards, which naturally have no personalities or psychological motivations for the destruction they caused. Many of the actors who were featured in the classic horror films had passed away, Boris Karloff being the great exception. And no one had seen the likes of vampires, werewolves, or zombies for some time. British audiences, who had no taste for large mutant vermin wreaking havoc on major cities, craved the gothic horror films that had once been so prolific in the 1920s, `30s, and `40s. But then came a sign f hope when a small English studio, Hammer Studios, released their first horror film, [[ASIN:B00006G8JZ The Curse of Frankenstein]], in 1957. A year later they would surpass that film with their take on the Dracula mythos.  It's ironic, but many of the best Dracula films are those that stray from the original Bram Stoker novel. Take for example [[ASIN:B000GPIPSS the classic 1931 Tod Browning film]], which starred Béla Lugosi as Dracula. That particular film was based more on the Hamilton/Deane stage play than on Stoker's novel, and yet it's probably the most iconic and most beloved Dracula film ever made. So it may be said that a film about the infamous vampire count doesn't necessarily need to be faithful to the novel in order to be considered a great film. With that in mind, I passionately recommend the Hammer Studios' 1958 film, Horror of Dracula.    Intrepid vampire hunters Jonathan Harker and Dr. Van Helsing set out to destroy the most deadly of vampires, Count Dracula. While Jonathan goes ahead to Dracula's castle under the false pretense of serving as Dracula's librarian, he is bitten by a seductive vampire and then imprisoned by the fearsome Count himself. When van Helsing arrives, he releases Jonathan from the cruel fate of the vampire, by driving a stake through his heart. But Count Draculahas disappeared, so van Helsing returns to England. There he goes to the home of the Holmwoods, where Jonathan's fiancée, Lucy, has been suffering from a bizarre sickness that resembles anemia. Lucy, it turns out, has been bitten by a vampire and soon she dies from blood loss. But later there are sightings of Lucy walking through the streets and attacking little children. Obviously she has become a vampire herself. Van Helsing hunts Lucy down and he realizes that Dracula has come to London. With the help of Lucy's elder brother, Arthur Holmwood, Van Helsing dispatches Lucy, once again with a stake through the heart. While Van Helsing and Arthur search for Dracula, Arthur's wife, Mina becomes Dracula's next victim. With the hopes that Dracula will come after Mina again, Van Helsing and Arthur use her to lure him out of hiding. Dracula, always at least one step ahead of his opponents, strikes again. After discovering Dracula's hiding place, Van Helsing and Arthur chase Dracula back to Transylvania where they must confront Dracula in order to save Mina from damnation.    Like all of Hammer's horror films, Horror of Dracula was made on a tight budget. The film featured all of the hallmarks of the Hammer films including melodramatic acting, suspenseful music, a thrilling story, campy humor, and generous helpings of voluptuous damsels in distress and dastardly villains. Directed by auteur horror filmmaker Terence Fisher, Horror of Dracula is the first in a series of [[ASIN:B000U1ZV7G great Dracula films released by Hammer Studios]].  The cast includes the inimitable Peter Cushing as Dr. Van Helsing and the venerated Christopher Lee as the snarling Count Dracula. Other cast members include Michael Gough as Arthur Holmwood, Melissa Stribling as Mina, and Carol Marsh as Lucy.  Though the story barely resembles Stoker's and the characters have been switched around and shuffled to the point that they lose their original identities, the film remains a classic among horror fans. Some might complain about the changes in the plot, historical inaccuracies, continuity errors, or the flat dialogue, but Horror of Dracula has its strengths as well. First of all, you can't deny that whenever Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee appear in the same film that the result is magic. Secondly, Terence Fisher revolutionized the horror genre with his wining combination of bloody violence and lustful antics. Most importantly, the film is just fun to watch whether you're a diehard film fanatic (like myself) or just a casual moviegoer.  In conclusion, Horror of Dracula is truly a classic.    With this year marking the 50th anniversary of the film, you would expect Warner Bros. to re-release Horror of Dracula in some special commemorative edition, but they have announced no plans to. For this reason and this reason alone, I give this DVD 4 stars. It deserves an elaborate 2-disc set!

0385340567|5.0|Um . . . I don't usually argue with everyday reviewers but have to say that I sincerely believe that anyone who says he or she doesn't like this book is totally wacked. It's a fantastic read. Not much more to say than that. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys highly atmospheric intrigue.

B001B71NOI|5.0|This is a great album by Trent Reznor, it sounds great. However, I buyed this 3 monts ago and my order lost. The Coustomer Service from amazon.com was excellent, they send me this one in a new order, replacing the lost one. Excellent record, excellent service.
B000CC4GEW|5.0|If you like the strategy behind battles of that period this movie is for you. I think it has the best battle scenes of any movie to date!! for war buffs this is a must!!!
0763619612|3.0|This book was just \\"okay\\". The illustrations are clever, but the ending is disappointing. Maybe some will be charmed with the simplicity, but it was just not for me.<br />I did think it had possibilities for a classroom teacher for an art project. It was a good book to look through a few times, but not necessarily to own.
0525950079|5.0|I am totally satisfied with everything I've ever ordered from Amazon. Ken Follett is an excellent writer that will have you into his books so quickly, you never want to put it down. I order the hard copies so I can reread them again. Always perfect shape and you don't have to wait forever to get whatever you're looking for with Amazon.   Keep it up guys.....you're the best,  Thank you for all the choices you give us avid readers,

B0019HQIFE|4.0|Though I only like a few of John Mayer's songs, this is a very well-done concert video with top-notch audio and video on Blu-Ray. I was surprised the song \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" didn't make the cut!
B00070DK1E|2.0|This CD ranks near the bottom of JT's material, but I'd like to use this forum to comment on the heavymetal grammy.<br />  It's true that  JT are  much more than a metal band, with their instrumental intricacy, taste and originality, but in the field of ROCKING OUT , any of the several incarnations of tull could wipe the floor with metalica pantera ,slayer or any of that crowd.<br />  Lars Ulrich vs Barlowe?<br />  Oh my God.I hit Lars level in my first year of playing drums.<br />  Hetfield vs Barre? heh heh heh!
B000NA28I4|2.0|I loved the book, but the movie was a HUGE letdown,it was like the movie makers said \\"The book was great so we are going to make something completely different\\",they didn't stick to the book at all here are a few examples,Saphira made her transformation into an adult dragon in a few minutes,they could have made the movie better by making it longer so they wouldn't have to cram so much into such a short amount of time,like the 4 minute \\"great\\" final battle.They left out some characters,Jeod,Angela,and Jormundur.The only part of this movie that I liked was the terrific acting by Jeremy Irons as Brom,he was even better in this movie than he was in Lion King.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|My 4 year old son loves this movie, and he watches this almost everyday from the moment I received it. It's blu-ray feature makes it really enjoyable to watch.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|That series is my wife's favorite of all times. She falls asleep watching it every night.
0743455967|5.0|This work is phenomenal.  I was only interested in the craft of writing and had never read Stephen King before.  Though the work is supposed to be a manual for better writing, it reads like a thrilling novel.  What a surprise.    I never imagined discussions of drafts, agents, editing, grammar, etc. could be woven together with King's biography to produce an astounding, readable text on writing.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|what else can I say. They're back! hell yeah...  Rough songs combined with easier songs, I love this album.     If you're a metal fan, just buy it.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's both appropriate and entertaining to all ages. It's a story about stickin' it to the man and making your own path in life. I really don't know how to say watch this movie other than, well, watch this movie.  Go Speed Racer.  Go Speed Racer.  Go Speed Racer gooo!
B00005JPO1|1.0|Just fifteen minutes into this film I realized how bad it was-Ford  acting stiffly when his stunt double or CGI twin isn't running around like a cartoon character; ugly, visually obnoxious looking color photography in dim lighting; bad acting straight from a Ed Woods film.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Slow, whinney and cheesy. Everything CLIP! that someone who has heard anything from NuMetallica in the last 15 years would expect. Just so I could write a fair review, I actually forced myself to listen to the whole thing. Gawd it's CLIP! bad. Just because they changed their logo don't think that they changed their CLIP! greedy, NuMetal, pop rocker, ways.<br /><br />  I assume the next step for CLIP! McTallica would be to get cockroack emo hair cuts and CLIP! start talking about slitting their wrists for attention. Anybody with a CLIP! brain knows that all of the remaining $elloutica fans would still buy it just like they bought Invisible Kid & Ja Rule... even if it is completely CLIP! defective!<br /><br />  If you want some good Lolz go download it on Pirate bay. You can get the entire CLIP! box set, demos, guitar hero version, etc. for free. Be sure to make copies to give out as hanukkah gifts to your CLIP! little sister and all her re re friends too. If you do though, please don't tell Larz. I wouldn't want him to jump out of a window or CLIP! his wrists or anything (That video WAS good, well the end anyway). Only a total CLIP! fool would pay anything for a defective product that should be recalled.<br /><br />  One last thing. Just because this band has insulted you, sold you out, pawned off defective products on you & over charged you, they still LOVE you. Larz told me to CLIP! tell you that he loves you and he's sorry. He also told me to tell you to get down to Wal-Mart and buy up every copy of Death CLIP! Magnetic before it gets recalled or he will call the police on you and have your ISP cut off.
B00005JPAO|5.0|The Queen is one of the most provocative films of the Royal Family that I've seen in years. It tells the story from the side of the Royal Family during a time of crisis and change in the UK. It was insightful to the problems that the Queen had during this time. The decisions that she had to make were not only stressful but went against the grain of the tradition that she held so dear and also against the era that she grew up in. It also showed that the people as well as Tony Blair knew that the country needed a change. Tony Blair was pivotal in keeping the Queen's image intact. Helen Mirren did an excellent job in portraying Queen Elizabeth II in this remarkable movie. She definitely brought her to life in this film and gave viewers a chance to see that the Queen is genuinely human.
B000002UB3|5.0|After doing their last gig on the roof of Abbey Road studios following their \\"Let It Be\\" sessions, the group gave it one more go before breaking up for good.  One of the reasons for the slight failure of \\"Let It Be\\" is that the Beatles weren't really functioning as the Beatles anymore.  The album was enjoyable but also very sloppy.  It was basically just a collection of solo pieces by each of the members.  Abbey Road, on the other hand, was a cohesive masterpiece that was just as good, if not better, than Sgt Pepper.  Everything here is in good order compared to the messy \\"Let It Be\\".  The songs, while they may seem like solo pieces, feature the band working together as a whole to accomplish its task of producing a great album and reestablishing their credibility as the best band of the 60s.  It showed that, even while under pressure, the band could do amazing things.    Abbey Road succeeds on many levels.  As an album, it almost has a conceptual feel to it.  The pending breakup of the band and its related events are felt in many of the songs.  \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" for example provides a glimmer of hope that the worst was over for the group.  \\"The End\\", stays true to its title by suggesting that this was truly the band's final show.  Despite being conceptual, the album's music is varied enough to satisfy the listener regardless of how many times they have heard it.  John Lennon turns out his usual rockers with the tracks, \\"Come Together\\" and, \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" while Paul McCartney sticks to his whimsical light pop with, \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", and, \\"Carry That Weight\\".  George Harrison contributes two of his best known songs with the gorgeous, \\"Something\\", and the afterformentioned, \\"Here Comes The Sun\\".  Even Ringo gets a shot at songwriting with the playful, \\"Octopuss's Garden\\".  In some cases, you can just see how the songs work together to raise the album high above the norm.  \\"Mean Mr Mustard\\" is the perfect companion to \\"Polythene Pam\\" despite one being a Lennon rocker and the other being a McCartney novelty.    The group may have been ready to implode but you would never know it just from this album alone.  This record showed the group at their strongest in both their playing and their songwriting.  As we all know, after the recording of this album, the group memebers all left for solo careers.  They all created great work by themselves but nothing as amazing as Abbey Road.  Proof that even though all the fighting and arguing, the group really was better off together.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I just finished watching all three back to back, and man: beautiful. I don't know how else to explain it. I didn't see the HD-DVD version, but having been an avid fan of the Matrix and upgrading from the SD-DVD Ultimate Collection, there are many noticeable differences.<br /><br />The main one, is that 80% of the graphic effects appear to have been cleaned up to 2008 standards. Granted, the motion capture in the Neo/Smith fights in #2 and #3 is still very 2003, so don't expect it to compare to [[ASIN:B000UR9T7I Spider-Man 3 [Blu-ray]]]. But, with the improved resolution and bit rate of bluray, there are many dramatic improvements to the look of the sentinels, the makeup effects for Neo's mouth coming together, the car chases and explosions, the human-skin textures of the cgi characters is improved, even some of the green screen composites look better. I am very pleased with my pre-order and would gladly recommend upgrading to anyone!<br /><br />[Though this did not detract from my enjoyment of the film, I will say I found the copyright notice, that appears in thirty-eight different languages at the end of the film to be insulting. I understand piracy is a big problem for studios, but to force us who paid $75.00 to sit through this crap insults my intelligence when people who pirate movies are going to pirate movies no matter how many times you list the notice. Like a Kenyan movie pirate is suddenly not going to copy this movie, simply because he read the notice in Swahili. Get real!! (No offence to anyone who speaks Swahili.)]
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Simply put, this is the best movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the Historical facts  about the attack.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have NEVER written a review on Amazon before, but since I purchased this DVD I have not touched any of my umpteen other ones. I work out in the mornings, and if I have a hard time waking up I can talk myself out of it. But now knowing that I can get a great workout done in 25 minutes, I have no excuse, I can get in a few more minutes of sleep, and I feel great afterwards. I work out one day a week with a trainer, and she gets me pretty sweaty in 1/2 hour. Now with the 30 Day Shred, I feel like I'm working out just as effectively as I am with the trainer, and boy do I get sweaty! I would love to have the trainer every day but I can't afford that, so this is as close as it gets.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|Apparently some people think Slipknot went way wrong with this, but I just don't see it. This definitely is Slipknot, perhaps at its best. They decided to go with more of a death metal rhythm, but they also used a softer voice more often than before. Overall, I think it works out to the same level of their other albums - Great.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Mr. Clapton does a wonderful job on Mr. Johnson's songs.  A top notch band as always, this time with Billy Preston on organ.  Just a really great album.
B001EL6EHC|4.0|I have been eagerly waiting for such a edition to be released for Casablanca. The printed materials and goodies coming along with this edition looks like awesome.But I think the packing is a big let down. I loved the packing of previous ultimate collector's editions from Warner brothers like The Wizard of Oz, Dirty Harry Collection, The Searchers, Rio Bravo, How the west was won, Matrix etc.My only concern about this edition is the 'top load' pack which I hate to have. Why don't they stick to their earlier design which is more comfortable to use and store?
0670018651|2.0|I was disappointed in this book and didn't find it useful. It doesn't have entries for KL, Jess (or any Jessica McClintock), or Giorgio - some of my favorites from the past. Scent is a very personal issue for me. First time I ever returned something to Amazon.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I just purchased this video and have used it several time so far, and I really like it.  I had been using another video for while before this, and was barely sore after.  With this video, I feel very challenged, and feel like I am getting a great workout for my whole body.  What I like best about the video is the three different workout levels- I am on one right now, but know that I will continue to challenge my body with this one video for quite a while.  Another good feature is that Jillian is very good at explaining what to do, why and how you are to move your body for each move.  It makes me focus on HOW I am doing each exercise, which makes them safer and more effective.   A great workout!
B000O178BY|4.0|...I'm going to say this right now...this is the last review of a NIN album (aka Subject B) that I'm going to do for a while...I've listened almost constantly to Trent's work for a week and I'm in need of a change...    ...so...Trent sobered up and made \\"With Teeth\\" by far their worst album so far...so what Trent have to lose with this? Apparently the instrumentals of this album were made on his laptop during touring and promoting With Teeth...could he possibly keep up the good work with extensive touring and instrumental sample compositioning? Well...they all definitely have an obvious structure if that's what you think...    ...Trent has also decided to be less introspective in this album and focus solely on insulting the US government...as a Brit I can honestly say he probably made some points but I wasn't paying attention...let's gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!    Hyperpower 8/10: Starts with a nice little drum track (lots of cymbal) and a synthed bass line...this is an instrumental introductory track and I have normally enjoyed the soundscapes Trent can create on his instrumental tracks...this one is nothing special but makes such a nice change to With Teeth I really don't care...at least the intro didn't rip off Kid A this time round...ends with crazy screaming and random static like riots in the streets leading to...    The Beginning of the End 7/10: Well well well...well well well WELL!!!! Takes the pop sensibilities of the previous album and adds much more synth to it...I don't think it's anything special at all...in fact when I realised how much I disliked this song I disliked it quite a bit...it's an ok track but just doesn't show me any magic...    Survivalism 8/10: Besides the fact that they took the first note from the main riff of \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and repeated it over and over again...it's a very nice trance like song...Trent's vocals are ok and they snap into staccato in the chorus with synthed sound and guitar wavering all overthe place...I can understand why this was picked as a single...it's a good hard hitting song with lots of complex melodic samples layered over it...the laptop work becomes very present on this song...besides the wavering guitar...the concept of Survivalism was also an interesting concept...possibly based around in this concept world that everyone is now fending for themselves...    The Good Soldier 8/10: Starting with a calm synthed drum line Trent starts singing in an awkwardly nicey way with the bass every now and then dominating the sound with its low power...I'm glad the bass has been brought back up in the mix for this album...he then adds some MIDI piano for that dark sinister feel...it's a good way to make a chorus instead of his sudden \\"I'M GOING TO BE LOUDER FOR THE CHORUS!!\\" Which I don't mind but sometimes Trent overdoes it...there is then a very interesting melodic synthed guitar track that adds a nice new dimension to the track before it finally ends...    Vessel 8/10: Taking more advantage of the stuff that can be done with his laptop he adds a lot of layers of loud noises with subtle drones (though they are very hard hear) and of course Trent then just nicely whispers/typically yells over it...the chorus is ok as the key changes between the voice and the awkward increase of pitch (usually used when we want to ask questions) is interesting...but I can't help thinking the tone is slightly...irritating...overall Trent's done some good sampling...but he needs to learn how to do good choruses again because his formula is running dry...    Me, I'm Not 9/10: Some very dark synthy sounds that transfer into Trent's vocals...there isn't much to analyze...but I shall admit it's a very strong song...filled with dark mechanical emotion that seems to muffle out all other thoughts...reminds me of some of future sound of london [[ASIN:B000003RY8 Dead Cities]] music...not entirely...but the way the atmosphere makes me feel...does seem to bring me back to that...but avery good dark and mechanical track...I think someone has a laptop to thank...    Capital G 9/10: It wouldn't matter whether I liked this song or not...I only have to listen to it once and Trent's voice going \\"I pushed the button derm dee derm dee derm DUH!!\\" Is in my head for the rest of the day...the lyrical content is probably pretty strong in contrast to the other songs...but what stands out for me is the trippy laptop noises after the choruses (to which the chorus is somewhat predictable) and of course Trent's infectious vocals that won't get out of my head...    My Violent Heart 8/10: Again starting with some synthetic drums...Trent talking incredibly quietly this time and the bass also thumping very lightly in the background...Trent then starts singing...still oh so quietly as everything builds up to the chorus...a very trippy sample filled and interesting rhythm...this then contrasts with the very quiet verse...after that it sticks with section B until the end...they need a change...I won't be so generous in my marking with the next track...    The Warning 7/10: A drum beat is covered with some computer altered guitar...followed by Trent singing...it's not awful or anything but he kind of killed the buzz by entering...for me anyway...some evil synths are added reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000BWHE6K Pretty Hate Machine]]...the guitar then re-enters and does its...thing...but yeah...the track just seems to plod along quite calmly...if it weren't for all the samples and altered instruments though this track would be pretty boring...    God Given 7/10: Starting with the usual random drum sampling...and the usual whispery vocals...by this point I'm craving something slightly different from Trent's crazy mind...maybe something that's actually calm and soothing in contrast...just something to make the eerie atmosphere slightly more sinister...because by this point I can pretty much predict Trent's formula...    Meet your master 8/10: Very nice random plinky notes start off Trent's awkward from falsetto to regular voice descend in pitch...it adds a nice awkward melody and harmony to it...the chorus is ok...but yet again...it's a little predictably with the quiet/loud formula...but I like the plinky notes and the singing in the verse so much...it gets 8...    The Greater Good 10/10: A drum track with awkward calm screeches in the background that have an awkward choral feel to them...the bass then enters very quickly grounding the track to the floor as some interesting xylophone effects are used to create a cold and mechanical ostinato...piano is then added for that nice dark organic feel within a cold machine...I've always enjoyed Trent's instrumental tracks...and in contrast to the other tracks I've heard before it...this just makes this track stand out even more...if you were interesting in [[ASIN:B0006FFRW0 The Downward Spiral]] and the instrumental tracks especially then you should enjoy this track...    The Great Destroyer 9/10: I like this song...the melodic structure is different to the others which makes a change and the guitar chords give it this real emotive feel...however...as the track progresses Trent tries to return the track to his basic rules by adding lots and lots of samples in his favourite key signatures...and of course then a very loud Bass which is forever whammed downwards with lots of crazy plinky notes invades the entire track...but I liked it so I don't mind...    Another version of the truth 9/10: Starting with some quiet sounds...the piano is added to this calm static noise...the track retains its subtlety for a while which makes me think this is perhaps going to be a calm instrumental track...and Trent does well with calm instrumental tracks (note that [[ASIN:B000929AJQ With Teeth]] had no instrumental tracks)...the piano very kindly treads around the cold atmosphere already generated...something about hearing piano on such an industrious album...it always feels really soothing...    In this twilight 9/10: Continues the dark atmosphere from the previous atmosphere very well turning it into a cold screechy and bass dominated sound...Trent's vocals add a real human aspect to the track however and it's very nice to hear...the way his voice echoes makes it sound like he's the only person left on the world...    Zero Sum 9/10: And so it ends with a calm eerie sound...drums machines coming in and out of noise with the piano calmly playing...Trent whispers \\"Do you remember the time?\\"...after a minute the bass within the track morphs the song into a more darker and staccato sound...Trent's singing becomes more noticeable...but it then returns to the dark desolate sound of section A...Section A and B are repeated until the end...a great way to end this album...with a dark and introspective look on our lives...the world in Trent's concept land is dead...    ...this album definitely gets better near the end with the sound being more lifeless and desolate like Trent's older work...the earlier tracks are more linked to pop structures with Trent's newer stuff but this album is definitely worth a listen if you like any of NIN's previous stuff...you'll either like it or hate it though...    ...from all the albums I've reviewed in ranking order this is how good I thought the albums were:    1. [[ASIN:B0006FFRW0 The Downward Spiral]]    2. [[ASIN:B000BWHE6K Pretty Hate Machine]]    3. [[ASIN:B000O178BY Year Zero]]    4. [[ASIN:B000929AJQ With Teeth]]    ...now that I am done with NIN for now I have been asked now for this experiment to review Marilyn Manson...seeing as Trent was an associate of Marilyn will I find anything of interest?
B0018CWEYY|5.0|So many things were revealed this season! Each episode was very strong with great references to books and movies. One of my favorite references was to the following video:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The Constant was one of the best episodes yet!<br /><br />Can't wait for season 5!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I, like most other people, bought the album release, only to be disgusted with the quality of the recording.  I mean, it is tragic that an album this good is ruined by a godawful-abortus of a production job.  If you enjoy unintentional distortion like blown laptop speakers turned up to the max, then by all means get the official album release -- you'll be in heaven.    With regard to the content of the album, if you enjoy any form of Metallica (new or old), this album will make you happy -- it is a great rock-metal album, period.    However, find the GH3 version in whatever way you can (I will leave the method/conduit up to you), because the sound quality is superb, and what this album SHOULD have sounded like to begin with.
B000002WE9|5.0|This performance given by Elvis Presley in the last years of his life; and the last concert to be held in Memphis, Tennessee, Elvis' home town, was undoubtedly one of the most inspirational and energetic of his career. Elvis honestly demonstrated his usual soulfull, and typical heartfelt sentiment in his performance; really shadowing the quality exhuded in his earlier days as the ultimate entertainer; and thereby, reinstating why he is and always will be the king of rock and roll.
B001DPC52C|5.0|'Black Symphony' is the most amazing thing Within Temptation has ever done. The new arrangements of the songs are stunning, the over all visual and technical aspects are amazing. When I watched the DVD for the first time, I was just in awe of everything and was blown away by the whole concert. It is defiantly something that every Within Temptation fan needs to have.
B000000W5L|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. Whenever I listen to this album I cannot help but think of Keith's rented villa in the south of France with the strange comings and goings and open doors and music being created as they passed the time in pleasant weather and decadence wondering what future lay before them after departing England and the oppresive liberal tax regime. If you have never read \\"Up And Down With The Rolling Stones\\" by Tony Sanchez, then you should. I think it probably does paint a rather accurate picture of what the atmosphere behind this album was, the atmosphere that shaped what this album became. It is essential reading, I believe, especially if you want to fully understand where this album's genesis came from. The strong reaction of the Stones camp and some of their key boosters against this book leads me to believe that the book hit a nerve and is probably closer to the mark than any other account of that time.<br /><br />Now to the album. Really it should be judged as a whole, that is where it stands the strongest. Some people love to cherry pick and nit-pick this album to death and dog it. That is their perogative, but it does miss the beautiful tapestry that is the journey that this album represents. If you don't get it, then you just don't get it. I understand that this album is not as accessible as many would like. I know they like \\"Brown Sugar\\", wish there was another \\"Gimme Shelter\\" on here somewhere - feel like there is not enough of that Rock 'N' Rolling Stones sound. Sorry, can't help you, you're right. But there is \\"Tumbling Dice\\", \\"Casino Boogie\\", \\"Torn And Frayed\\", \\"Sweet Black Angel\\", \\"Loving Cup\\", \\"Turd On The Run\\", \\"Let It Loose\\" and \\"Shine A Light\\". These rythms will stick in your head and haunt you after just a couple of listens. In fact, with each hearing of the album you sink deeper under its spell. And then soon you find yourself fully convinced that this is their best work ever. I am not one of those, because I am biased in favor of the Rock 'N' Rolling Stones, but I will say this about the album. It stands alone among all Stones albums. You can compare and contrast other Stones albums, but it is very difficult to do that with this album. It was almost as if they were channeling spirits while they recorded thses tracks. Channeling the spirit of the Mississippi River of the early 20th Century. And though these influences had always been there and would be there even after Exile, they would never quite be as \\"Under the Influence\\" as they were for this album. A psychic journey to the Crossroads and back again.
B000EGEVZK|5.0|As a man you is in his early 50's living in NJ with about a 45min ride to CBGBS I lived my early life going to the punk clubs weekly seeing them all from the Ramones to Blondie and my fav's Johnny Thunder's Heartbreakers. This is by far the best live collections of any of the bands of that era, It brought such a smile to my face and had my feet tapping throughout. This is real punk from when punk was a word people made up as that is what they thought of the music and the simplicity of it, as they just did not get it yet. We were far from punks, just kids who were sick of the boring music of the time and wanted music that came from the begining of rock- 3 minutes of high energy music that made you dance(anyone remember the pogo?) no more no less. This DVD is the real deal, not the phony placebo garbage that started when the so called new wave era started when the record executives saw that they could make some cash and tried to have bands sound punk and look punk(punk was an additude not a look). So if some of you kids want to see and hear this additude pick this up and you'll know what the true so called punks of that era were doing- just having fun and to put it mildly that was the keyword of that era FUN. Pick it up and you'll be bopping and smiling throughout, as you'll in an instant that this music is the truely real punk that bands today still are trying to imitate but sadly a Ramones song says it all \\"You Don't Come Close\\". As you cannot fake a true additude, this dvd is the documented truth of that, and damn is it fun.
B000000W5P|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. This was for me the first album of theirs to come out after becoming fully aware of who the band were and buying it at its point of release. Prior to this I was buying history lessons. I bought the original cover. Still got it. I have no use for \\"Miss You\\", but everything else on this album is solid, whether it be \\"When The Whip Comes Down\\", \\"Respectable\\", \\"Far Away Eyes\\", \\"Just My Imagination\\", or \\"Shattered\\" and \\"Beast of Burden\\". Often compared to Between the Buttons because of its raw, straight ahead rock sound and approach - a comparison I endorse with caveats - I like to compare it to A Bigger Bang, or rather vice versa. Of course, I did not have that comparison at my disposal until recently, but I think the aficionados understand what I mean. The history and tumult surrounding this album is interesting history. Read about it from others. The album is so good in fact that I rate it as high as Beggars Banquet, while understanding that Beggars is a more important album, but only slightly. For me not quite as good or creative as Tattoo You, but these are fine hairs I am splitting. Suffice it to say that after the five album run that started with Beggars and finished with Goats Head Soup, this album and Tattoo You obviously follow next in the Stones Best In Class Albums. Why don't you have it?
B00005JPO1|4.0|The first two thirds of this movie were pretty fantastic and very gripping. It delivered the goods for everyone waiting to check back in with the rough-and-tumble Dr. Henry Jones, (junior ... ahem). But having grown up with Indiana Jones, I've already gotten past the Lucas Factor of being let down long ago. I hung my head in shame after I scurried home from the theatre after seeing '[[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 The Temple of Doom]]' back in 1984. I wish I had missed that film altogether, even to this day. Needless to say there is a section of this film which I find down-right embarrassing and the Cthulu call for George Lucas.<br /><br />Crystal Skull takes a nose dive during the 'Jungle Chase' scene which seems to be action filler so Cate Blanchett and Shia LeBeouf can rack up some screen-time minutes or perhaps fill a quota or a  contractual agreement with the producers. Whatever it was, it was not just the slowest part of the movie but also the most unnecessary and the biggest reminder, or throw back to The Temple of Doom, thus far. Going over cliffs was well covered in parts two and three, but now we have to revisit it again just so we can add to the run time.<br /><br />I do realize that it was just framework to the very interesting fight-action sequence with the ants which was cool and had a nostalgic feel to it. I think that kind of action is what people tuned in for, but what came before it in the ten minutes previous and the next ten minutes after, should have been left in the editing hard-drives.<br /><br />The 'Jungle Chase' scene though, more directly is classic Lucas faire. He's probably covered this same ground in almost every film he's ever done. A lot of people have complained loudly about just this sort of thing spoiling the Star Wars franchise. So why bother to do it again? The scene of a young fighter precariously hanging on to some shaky edifice, fighting for his life with legs splayed akimbo, desperately trying to fend off his enemy and move the story forward with some type of sword fight. Sigh ... please.<br /><br />How many times did we see this stuff in Episode I, II and II? Too many. It only seemed that Lucas began to learn his lessons by the third film, which was already too late as he had alienated his core audience and even most adults. His interest in his Lego Land contracts and peddling to toddlers always looked to interfere with his real filmmaking, unlike Spielberg who never pandered or bowed full-bend to the marketing aspect of these productions never forgetting that the reason for the film was not the toys.<br /><br />So why Spielberg would let this kind of element creep in and slow down such a good movie is beyond me. Maybe he just can't tell the guy, his good friend, George -- that what he's 'seeing' isn't that great after all. We saw this same element in Jedi, which killed the movie and now he pulls it out once more. At least you can see that Spielberg learned a few things over the years with some of his other movies, by using the absurd to insert his heroes into history like in [[ASIN:B00003CXA2 Forrest Gump]] in the 'Doom Town' sequence.<br /><br />In all honestly, this film is a perfect candidate for fanedit dot com. A place where film editors, some professional, some work-man, anonymously re-edit films removing certain scenes or offending elements, tightening them up and making them better movies in most cases. A good example of work done through fan edit was [[ASIN:B0007V6ITE Blade III]] (retitled 'Kill The King'). All instance of Hannibal King, aka Ryan Reynolds is completely removed. Having seen the movie, I can tell you without doubt it's leagues better than the studio release.<br /><br />I thought I had seen everything in film, but watching Dr. Jones step into the refrigidaire and close the door on himself in order to avoid a nuclear blast was pretty riveting to say the least and very inventive. It's exactly this kind of chess-playing in the writing that most people are hoping to see. The scene where Indy crests over the berm and is face to face with the mushroom cloud is a great piece of film-making. For the last two years I've been seeing artificial CG renderings of atomic and nuclear bomb blasts showing up on blogs and littering youtube, now I know why and where they came from. Some people were put-off by this and cried foul, but every element in this franchise is over the top. Trying to ground it in Christopher Nolan workman-style realism is foolish. Are you paying attention?<br /><br />Upping the ante at this point in the film was pretty genius as well as wiley, making room for excellent long-range planning. Immediately after the radioactive scrub down, we learn that Dr. Jones, is ... gasp ... an Army General ... and then a member of OSS ... gasp! ... and later a double-agent within the CIA. The back story that was built up lends this whole franchise to now be reinvented and the older adventures of the [[ASIN:B000VDDDVE Young Indiana Jones]] to be forgotten and revisited, probably picked up as Dr. Jones runs through a secret trap door from Hitler's Bunker with a smoking gun, not played by Shia LeBeuf, but possibly some as of yet unknown. The writers scored a big plus here and I'm sure Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were very happy when they read that portion of the script.<br /><br />The ending of the film where the mantle doesn't pass, yet, is probably the question both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have been batting around themselves. Who will take over my life's work, when my hair is too gray, too thin, my time too short and my interest in the job too waning? You have to wonder who exactly has been groomed to carry on all those unfinished projects, the war adventures of Indiana Jones being apart of that probably massive pile.<br /><br />The Fifth and likely conclusion to this franchise in this era is already being discussed, planned and will probably be announced sometime in March of 2009. Harrison Ford is close to 70 now so time is of the essence in every aspect. The directors are older, too as are the producers. The question of handing his whip & pistol over is a tricky one. Edging out the hero from a franchise has proven fatal before. Yes, back to Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer we go.<br /><br />There was a time in Hollywood when studios no longer wanted to bankroll and produce comic book action movies because a long string of failures that had almost bankrupted several studios in the mid-nineties. A few actually folded. Then along came Wesley Snipes and [[ASIN:0780624890 Blade]]. It's no secret that Blade reinvigorated the genre and thus the current generation, singularly, owes him a debt of gratitude greater than his IRS burden or the value of Ed McMahon's home. Blade made a lot of money and gave both the confidence and greenlight to other movies that in turn did well and made money.<br /><br />But one day, David Goyer disagreed with Wesley Snipes like a bad episode of House MD and broadcast it unfairly from the rooftops, thus Alienating our favorite Vampire Killer. Wesley didn't think Vampire Hunters teaming up with him was a good idea or that the Vampire Hunters should be teenagers. It sounded good, because after all Vampire films started off with stuff like [[ASIN:B0000AUHOK Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter]], again -- it sounded good. But, Wesley openly disagreed with the direction of the franchise and was ignored. It didn't go well, neither did the movie. But I mentioned this already, didn't I? In this scenario, with Harrison Ford, there is no disagreement, but the problem is the same. The studio needs to extricate its hero and find a way to continue without being a clich&eacute;. All I can say is: Good luck, folks.<br /><br />Overall, this story covers a lot of ground, and perhaps in retrospect, maybe too much. Maybe the flaw of this film was giving the audience too much to chew on. I was happy to see Cate Blanchett in something other than a period costume drama of either Elizabethor a depression era redressing of Katherine Hepburn. I felt the film time that she was given was adequate (minus the 'Jungle Chase') and  her character was more than fleshed out for the escapist action drama that we were all sinking into. Sometimes not overstating a character gives the character more power. Look at Julianne More as [[ASIN:B001AEF6D6 Maude Lebowski]] who has little screen time compared to Walter or The Dude, but she has one of the most memorable modern film roles in recent history. Who doesn't remember the line: 'Do you like coitus, Jefferey?'<br /><br />You don't need to beat a viewer over the head in order to make a point. I think we all got the evil persona that she was after the Area 51 scene. Doctor-Professor was a nice touch. Look for it soon in the next Pixar flick. Blanchett's period costume though left much to be desired as she looked more like Lara's work-camp daughter from [[ASIN:B00003CX9M Doctor Zhivago]] than she ever did as a female version of Dr. Evil in her gray and unappealing jumpsuit. Trying to work us on a seductive Madame Blavatsky angle was good and quite interesting and probably factual to period maniacs of the time, but they overplayed her hand and dashed the project into the rocks that they thought were heading for, all in the drama.<br /><br />Also, as much as I like Ray Winstone, ([[ASIN:B00005UV33 Sexy Beast]] is a masterpiece), I felt that his addition was overwrought and unnecessary. Somehow his whole presence seemed very last-minute, maybe his role had something to do with the script leak. Maybe. Maybe not.<br /><br />The ending is quite good. The whole story arc of Roswell, Area 51, General Jones comes together nicely and is probably one of the few times in blockbuster cinema where the subject matter is dealt with in an interesting manner and not treated as an off-handed joke. Knight's 'Signs' was an interesting mix of fundamental religion versus new-age lore and was treated well there. It was handled with equal skill here.<br /><br />Maybe, with a few more viewings and a couple of sit-downs with the commentary track (ahem ... next DVD version of course, as this one doesn't have one), my thoughts will develop and change, but until then, I think I've gilded the Lilly to the point of wilting.<br /><br />.... ....s.

B00005GA0W|1.0|This is *not* a hybrid CD, just a plain SACD, which you can get 80% cheaper elsewhere.
B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|I haven't read all (or many) of the reviews for this yet but in the ones that I have read I haven't heard a thing about 3D. WATCH THE MOVIE ON A GOOD SIZED SCREEN TV WITH 3D GLASSES ON!!!!!!!!!! You know the red and blue lensed ones? When you watch it like that you wil be amazed! The most realistic psychodelic video ever! Please trust me and order some 3D glasses, this movie, and ask whomever you know that has a big screen if you can borrow a few minutes of it's time. It is SOOOO awesome what they have made!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Great series, extremely realistic. If you are fascinated or enjoy the ins and outs of US politics you will love this series.

B001CD6FKS|4.0|The film truly is visually wondrous to behold in high definition.  It's flat-out one of the most spectacular films to look at from the medium's history and the editing infrastructure is highly sophisticated for a film primarily aimed at younger audiences.  This will probably go down as the Blade Runner of kids' movies and by grace of time it will hopefully one day have a renaissance.  Everybody whom I've screened it to have kicked themselves thereafter for passing up on the chance to see it theatrically when it was unjustly shunned by the masses.  I think the animus against the film was more about some people still having a bone to pick with the Wachowskis over the Matrix sequels, the second of which I felt was grossly undeserving of such censure by the way.
0307383415|5.0|This is NOT the usual self-serving \\"autobiography\\" of a politician that was ghost-written by his speechwriter and rushed into print just before the primaries.  In this lyrical, beautifully written memoir, a young man struggles to come to terms with his heritage as a child of biracial parents.  It is unusually honest, even noting in an afterword where his memory clashes with that of his sister: did he meet her in an airport or a bus station?  There is a painful rawness as he speaks of Kansas, which shaped his grandparents, of Hawaii, where his parents met and parted, of Indonesia where his mother remarried, of returning to Hawaii to live with his grandparents and go to school.  He touches upon the wounds of youthful rebellion, of pulling back from the brink.<br /><br />He says little of his mother but one can get a sense of the strength and compassion of her character by the fact that she raised her son to admire and see greatness in the character of the man who had abandoned her--who had in fact other wives.  He visited only once, when the author was ten. Later, as an adult, the author travels to Kenya, his father's country and meets his sister and his African relatives.  He learns that his father was not the man he thought and that although his father had potential, it was never realized.<br /><br />The author returns to America to wrestle with the issue of his brown skin and how some people in America react to that.  There is self-discovery on all levels of this reflective book. To write like this a man must grapple with the demons of his own soul and emerge victorious. It's the kind of journey and coming of age that equips a hero to slay monsters, I think.<br /><br />This book is not about politics.  If you are interested in Obama's political philosophy, turn to The Audacity of Hope.
B00005JPO1|3.0|COMMENTARY TRACK and DELETED SCENES.<br /><br />After shelling out over twenty bucks for a two-disc special edition DVD, I expect a commentary track and deleted scenes. Or at the very minimum one of the two. But this DVD offers neither.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to delve into the debate over whether this is a good \\"Indiana Jones\\" film. To be honest, I enjoyed it on its own merit, but it does not compare to the original trilogy.<br /><br />With that said, the DVD release is a major disappointment to this long-time Indy fan. I will say that the making-of feature is impressive; most of Lucas' making-of features usually are, so it didn't come as a surprise. But it still left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The three-star rating is for the DVD itself, not the film - if you're here, you've probably already decided how you feel about the film. My advice to casual fans is to stick with the standard one-disc release. Hardcore fans might find the making-of bonus features worth it.
0140544518|5.0|When I read this book, I loved it. When I read it to Kindergarden-First grade children they loved it as well. One could do many activites and have many discussions about this book. Highly recommend, not only for teachers.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|This was simply a fun filled car racing kind of movie.  The critics were most likely looking for a MATRIX home run.  No way to make a family movie MATRIX-fied.  I really enjoyed this movie, my 11 year old daughter enjoyed the movie too.  A couple of cuss words that for a PG family movie that weren't really necessary.  That kind of bothered me a little bit.  Rent it.  Buy it.  At least check it out.  Worth the viewing.
0525478183|5.0|I read the book in four hours when I got it today because I just could not put it down. I alternately laughed aloud and got teary-eyed. I cared so much for Margo...I both loved her, wanted to be her, and hated her as well. The book was so full of drama, comedy, and suspense; it is the second best book I've read this year, (running a close second only to The Book Thief by Marcus Zusak). I am going to encourage my high school students to read this as one of their independent reading choices this school year.
B00005JPO1|4.0|A movie that anyone who saw the first three was waiting for. The movie was packed with action and had good acting. The only problem was the ending, I enjoyed every part of the movie exept for the last few minutes. Overall, it follows the same path as the other Indiana Jones' films and is true to the theme of them all. Very good and one I would recommend.
B000000YNZ|5.0|With Evan's 2nd trio, this album iniated the second stage of the late pianist's evolution into a balladeer of the piano.  Starting \\"Re: A Person I Knew\\" an anagram for Orrin Keepnews as well as an elegy for the late bassist Scott LaFaro, Evans' playing grew in intensity with this classic album.  It was also the \\"Best of the Month\\" in the Hi/Fi Stereo Review by Nat Hentoff or was it Joe Goldberg?  Regardless this version of this original by Evans remains the definitive one and reason enough to get this album but there are other treasures to behold the ear from \\"the Chopin of jazz/contemporary piano\\".  Rarely heard gems like \\"In Love in Vain\\" are coupled with the fresh re-workings of \\"It Might as Well Be Spring\\" and \\"Polka Dots & Moonbeams\\" plus a classic Evans original, \\"Very Early\\".  If you're are in a contemplative or introspective mood, you'll be rewarded by listening to this album.  Recommended for all romantics and poets!!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|[[ASIN:B000YABIQ6 Mad Men - Season One]] has completely changed the way I view TV.  I generally watch things at random and don't watch a lot of shows consistently.  This is a show worth changing that for.  It's hard to describe what makes this show such a rare event in TV.  Somebody had the vision to put a show on TV that has something to say and is as raw, honest and true to the period it is based on.  I, for one, am grateful for that.<br /><br />The show centers on the NY advertising world of the 1960s. Why \\"Mad Men?\\"  The old row of famous agencies on Madison Avenue, of course.  The men are sexist, rude, slicked up, and well dressed. The women are submissive yet cunning, half accepting sexism and half ignoring it.<br /><br />There's not a lot of political correctness here.  That is bound to offend some.  While my first reaction was to wonder as to the motives behind that, the truth is that after watching the show for a few episodes it becomes clear that the bigotry of the period is key to understanding the characters.  Plenty that the characters say would get them fired today. For their era, sexist banter in the office was considered par for the course.<br /><br />There's also plenty of smoking, drinking and sexual situations.  If you are very conservative this might not be for you.  Yet even conservative people would have to warm up somewhat to the effectiveness of the portrayal. This show makes you believe you are witnessing things as they were. Not having been there, we can't know for sure.  Regardless, this sure is convincing.<br /><br />There are some nice special features and extras sprinkled sparingly throughout the disks.  Of course you have your usual commentary tracks on the episodes, which are actually worth listing to in my opinion.  Not every show can say that.<br /><br />The behind-the-scenes documentary section is also standard fare, but well done. It covers the basic elements of how the show is put together, from characters, sets, makeup, wardrobes, and art design. You also get some small extras that are nice like a segment on scoring the music for the show, which is great, and audio clips of some of the period songs that are used.<br /><br />Because of the way the disks are set up, many of these specific extras are on the individual disks.  So you have to search for them. Also, there are only a few episodes per disk (about 3).  I guess those extras and commentary tracks took up a lot of disk space.  Still, these are minor details.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />This is a great show and well worth watching again and again.  I hope you will check this out if you haven't already.<br /><br />Enjoy!small extras that are nice like a segment on scoring the music for the show, which is great, and audio clips of some of the period songs that are used.

B001FBSMW6|5.0|This time Keane has treated us to a lavish, slightly retro flavored CD that simply bursts with epic, catchy, melodic  pop anthems. \\"Perfect Symmetry' represents Keanes most creative and imaginative effort to date.  Some standouts include \\"Lovers are Losing\\" \\"you haven't told me anything\\" \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" \\"Pretend that Alone\\" and \\"Black Burning Heart\\".  I would encourage those that did not immediately resonate with \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" to give it a few more listens, as sometimes Keane songs need to develop and grow on you.  \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" is simply Keane's best effort to date.
B001D25N2Y|5.0|Lady GaGa is being hailed as the new Madonna, her music is infectious, memorable, and rich. Her voice is easily the strongest, and most addicting we've heard in many years, rivaling that of Christina Aguilera. Lady GaGa mixes modern dance with a retro 1950's theme, even going back as far as the roaring 20's with songs like \\"Vanity\\". She's the first pop star that is a well trained vocalist, and musician. Definitely give this album a shot, if you really love music.

B001FBSMW6|1.0|I was REALLY looking forward to this CD because I love Keane's other two albums (especially the first one) and was of theirs. However, I am extremely disappointed by this album. Keane's music has lost its emotionally soothing tones (the ones that always made me feel like crying because they really touched something in my heart). Now Tom's tones just sound rigid and angry. :0( Likewise, the instrumental tones are rough sounding, rather than peaceful. The only song I like on the album is The Lovers are Losing. Other than that, I'm just really, really disappointed.
0553385461|3.0|While this book is shorter and more entertaining than its not-as-brief predecessor, I found it still unable to make the very esoteric subjects of space-time curvature, quantum mechanics and the behavior of sub-atomic particles understandable to me (MS Computer Science).

B001GAOY5U|2.0|One of the things I will always say about Brendan Fraser is, he's a great actor who is a part of some terrible movies. What is it about the guy that has him reading a script and saying \\"yeah I wanna star in that movie\\"? Does he have some form of learning difficulty, or does he do it on purpose to test how far he can push his fans before they say \\"OK that's enough\\"? One thing's for sure, \\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\\" is one of his worst films to date. Not only is it a terrible story featuring some terrible supporting actors, but a film that needs to take advantage of the best CGI technology in the world, seems to fall short on its budget... or their CGI guy hates the director, one or the other. The prospect of what lies in the centre of our Earth is an intriguing one, and has only really been touched upon in a good way by the movie \\"The Core\\", however, this just falls short of grabbing my interest. I'm aware this is based on the Jules Verne novel and in some ways could be considered a 21st century sequel, however, it pales in comparison to the fantasy of the original.<br /><br />The story focuses around scientist Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) and his quest to find his lost brother. On the way his nephew, Sean played by Josh Hutcherson (that annoying kid from Zathura), and his Mountain guide Hannah played by Anita Briem... I've never heard of her either stumble across the Centre of the Earth. That's right, I said stumble, because apparently you just stumble across a portal to the centre of our planet. I know it's a fantasy film, but come on, you can't seriously expect my kids to buy the fact that a scientist, his nephew and a mountain guid stumble across the centre of our planet. What about the mountain guide? She's a guide, for the mountains. Has she not seen this pathway before? Maybe she has and she just forgot it was there, let's be honest, it's an easy thing to forget about in the hectic day of a mountain guide.

B00104W8T6|1.0|there are times you wish the samples of the music were less than 10 seconds. this is one of them. there is so much creativity here that im not even going to capitalize anything. how much more will hollywood try to shove down our throats. we are already puking. line this up with all the jlo-jho spears trash and incinerate. hey -- let some more rich kids get together to make a movie and a soundtrack and give it some awards and expect everyone to like it and then tell everyone your successful. nevermind -- they are doing this to us  over and over and over. this is like home movies and music of some studio dads children -- we don't need this garbage. bottom line if you want to throw up buy this.

B00005JLK1|4.0|Ghost Ship is a fast-paced horror/haunting type movie.  I thought everything about the movie was great except that it moved a little too fast at times, and it was over before I was ready for the end.  I wish it had been a little longer and that a little more time had been taken to build tension during some of the scarier passages.  That said, the acting was great; the visuals were incredibly convincing, even after watching the \\"making of\\" feature I had a hard time spotting where special effects had been pasted together to make the final image I was watching - seamless.  Writing wise, they sort of rushed past some of the explanations as to what the various ghosts were trying to get the living people to do. Still, I love haunting movies and especially ones that occur at sea.  This one captured that creepy, desperate, isolated-at-sea vibe and never let it slip.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|Too little, too late.<br /><br />It seems to me that nobody really wanted to make this movie when they had a chance to, before H. Ford and S. Connery Esquires got too old, and when money making movies had become like painting by numbers.<br /><br />Now that the number of good films has seriously deteriorated over the last two or three years the tendency to rely on old warhorses to pull one out of the bag has become too strong to resist.<br /><br />To be fair Cate Blanchett pulls off an outstanding performance and even though this is a P13 movie, she certainly raises the blood pressure as a genius scientist dominatrix and makes everyone else pale into insignificance. What a waste of John Hurt's talent though. Times must be hard indeed.<br /><br />The plot is more like Indiana Jones meets the X-files as far as it goes.<br /><br />Frankly, if you do not think about it too much, it can be fun, but it is a bit difficult to avoid the painfully poor effects in the puerile car chase through the jungle, being very reminiscent of those films where superimposition was the order of the day.<br /><br />Finally, the great thing about this last installment is the impetus to pull the others off the shelf and watch them all over again to see when Indiana Jones was the last action hero.
015603283X|5.0|An amazing, intelligently written, mystery and occult puzzle novel written by a favorite Spanish author. Books, writers, collectors and dealers in old and rare books are introduced into this story about a certain book dealer who makes his living researching and finding and buying and selling books for a selected clientele. Lucas Corso is hired to authenticate part of an original manuscript, part of \\"The Three Musketeers\\", written by Alexander Dumas ;Dumas was known to collaborate with others when he wrote his novels, hence the need for verification. As he goes about this task, he is engaged by a very wealthy collector, Varo Borja, to research a demonic book called \\"The Book of The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows\\" supposedly authored by Lucifer himself. The book is supposed to enable the owner, if he can figure out the puzzles, to meet the Devil and become all powerful. There are only three such volumes in existence and Corso is charged to examine each one in order to assure Borja that the one he has is genuine; he suspects it might be a forgery. (Perhaps, Borja tried to meet the Devil and the ritual did not work) Corso finds himself involved in a complicated plot where he meets people that seem, to him, to resemble the main characters of the \\"Three Musketeers\\", a sensuous woman the wife of the previous owner of the manuscript that he identifies as Milady De Winter and a man who is closely identified with the woman he thinks of as Rocheforte.  At the same time ,as he begins to compare the  second of the Book of the Nine Gates, he discovers that while the binding, the paper and the print are identical, there are slight differences in the nine prints. He also discovers that some of the prints were originated by the publisher and others were originated by another person \\"LCF\\" (Lucifer?). Corso is followed and threatened by the person he thinks of as Rocheforte but each time he is in danger, he is rescued by a strange young girl who follows him. As the story progresses, death and destruction of their libraries come to the two other owners of the Book of Nine Gates; the books are destroyed but the prints were removed prior to burning the books.  Corso finds himself in the middle of a twisting plot that involves devil worship, occult practices and a secret organization relating to Alexander Dumas.   This was a fascinating novel; the plot was complex and the climax was interesting and throughout the book there were lively discussions between Corso and book dealers and book collectors where literally hundreds of novels and author's works were discussed or quoted from and great care was taken in the story to show the sources that Corso and others used as they researched both the manuscript and the occult book.  This novel was adapted into a film by Roman Polanski. Johnny Depp played Corso in this dark and exciting movie called \\"The Ninth Gate\\". Get the DVD.

B001C3KCSY|5.0|Okay, so I'll admit I'm new to the Kings of Leon fan-dom.  In fact, I'd never even heard of them until their recent appearance on Saturday Night Live.  But, I was so impressed with their performances that I purchased their latest release \\"Only By The Night.\\"  And I was blown away!!!    This disc is perfection, from start to finish -- not a bad song to be found.  I've listened to clips of some of their earlier stuff, and I like their latest release sooo much better.  Now, for you Kings of Leon purists, you'll say that I'm a johnny-come-lately who doesn't really understand the origins of this band and the sound they were putting out.  You'll say they've lost their edge and gone commercial.  But I say that for pure listenability, \\"Only by The Night\\" scores a 10.      For those of you, like me, who had never heard of this band, give this disc a spin -- you won't be sorry.  And for the others of you who've been with Kings of Leon from the beginning, I encourage you to give it another listen.  You just might find that it grows on you.  :)
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Why sit down to see a mindless, massively historically altered, action film like 300 when one can see something that is not only for the large part historical accurate but moving as well. That is exactly what Amazing Grace is. Amazing Grace is a moving, inspirational, true story of what one man and a righteous cause can accomplish. Add on to the story itself some terrific acting and excellent production values and you get one of the best films of 2007.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd gives an outstanding (for which he should have been Oscar worthy) performance as William Wilberforce. He is intense in the scenes where he is passionate and he is just as believable in the scenes where he is disgruntled. Not to mention him and Romola Garai share chemistry as a romantic couple and that he also is highly believable as the best friend of the Prime Minister. This is Grufford's best work to date and I hope to see more work of this caliber in the future.<br /><br />The supporting cast is top-notch as well. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Prime Minister Pitt and, as I wrote above, he shares a lot of chemistry with Gruffudd. The same is true of Romola Garai who plays the wife of Wilberforce. She is convincing as a figure whose passionate views could make Wilberforce fall in love and continue a struggle he has lost faith in. Albert Finney makes a few dabbles into the film as the man behind the song, John Newton. He is excellent as the guilt ridden slave ship captain turned preacher. Michael Gambon is also excellent as one of Wilberforce's biggest supporters in Parliament. Roundign out this amazing cast is the villains: Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and the ever excellent Toby Jones.<br /><br />The film's script is near perfect. The story is a true one which proves that fact is, as always, better then fiction. The story never delves too deeply into sentimentally but keeps the story's emotional power in firm check. The scenes of debate are tense and even at times frustrating. The only fault of the writing is the lack of a point of view from the slaves themselves. We are given only a few brief glimpses into their world and the basis of the film is given to us only in those glimpses and some of the dialog. Yet the writing supplements the acting and by the end of the film the viewer(at least the audience I saw this film with in theatres when it came out)cheering and applauding the final vote in Parliament.<br /><br />The production values of the film are high and impressive. The film manages to take you in and bring back to a distant and gone time and place. The world as it was then comes alive in a way that few other films manage to do. This is evident throughout the sets and costumes. Also there is the score by David Arnold who creates a score that captures all the emotional power of the story and is the composers best work to date.<br /><br />It is a shame that other, lesser films hovershadowed this film in both box office dollars and in the minds of audiences while it was in theatres. This a film that leaves you believing that with the right cause and a passionate person to back it and nurture it, anything is possible. It is a story that should not, and hopefully never will, be forgotten.a point of view from the slaves themselves.

B001E1DJD4|5.0|Rachael Yamagata practically bleeds talent, spilling it out in her voice - sometimes dark and moody, sometimes brash and bright - and over the keys of her piano or the strings of her guitar, pumping passion into the air on the notes of her songs, pouring into your heart all the feelings and ideas you can handle and then some.<br /><br />Her new double-CD, 'Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart' looks at the complexities of love and relationships from two perspectives.<br /><br />The nine songs on the first disc are largely the quieter ones, glowing with warmth bur rarely burning bright. Any yet, though these songs are on the softer side, they always carry a quality of strength and power. Lyrically they are the more challenging songs, such as in 'Over and Over,' which sings about a \\"happy ending\\" in which winds scream and fog breaks every door and rivers rise -- a happy ending that ends in destruction, but cleansing.<br /><br />The five songs on the second disc are louder, musically more powerful and more straightforward, simpler in their presentation. Yet for all their bright chords and strident instruments, they unveil an inner vulnerability.  There is a toughness here that covers up deeper feelings, a passion that protects but also lays bare the soul.  \\"Faster\\" comes out like a declaration of independence, and \\"Sidedish Friend\\" makes a powerful yet intimate statement about relationships on the side.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, 'Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart' shows us Rachael Yamagata refining her style and her technique, with these songs coming out more polished and produced than those on 'EP' or 'Happenstance'. However, underneath all that is still that raw heart that Rachael has always had, passion pulsing, overflowing, flooding out in her music and on the tones of her sultry, smoky voice.<br /><br />Where music works best, where it really counts, is the place where it calls out to the heart, where it resonates and quickens the blood. On that score, Rachael Yamagata never misses a beat.
B001I0Z43Y|3.0|The moment I held the CR-5400 in my fingers, I noticed it's not as \\"solid\\" as a regular memory stick duo pro without any microsd cards inserted and it's somewhat flexible. But it doesn't worry me too much since I will probably never take out the two 8gb microsdhc cards that I have inserted.  When I inserted two 8gb Kingston microsdhc cards and tried to format it with my PSP, I received an error. I was, however, able to format the format the CR-5400 with the two microsd cards inserted with my camera, as it was a sony product. Afterward I was able to use it on my psp.  Another thing I had trouble understanding was switching the microsd cards. Since after I formatted the CR-5400 with the microsd cards, I took the microsd in slot 2 out and wanted to see if I was able to use just 8gbs that was inserted in slot 1. It didn't work, instead my psp asked me to format the CR-5400. So does that mean we have to in a way \\"assign\\" microsd card pairs?? That is something I always wondered when I read the directions on how to use the CR-5400.  I am still very satisfied with the CR-5400 despite some of it's flaws. There is no difference in the read and write speed between using the CR-5400 and an actual memory stick duo pro, and in some instances the CR-5400 is faster in performance. And this using the CR-5400 and microsd cards is the way to go as to opposed to actually using actual and expensive memory stick duo pros! A real money saver!
0385340990|5.0|It's very easy for a book of this kind to cross the narrow line that separates warm & fuzzy from saccharine & irritating, but the authors manage to keep to the right side consistently -- while delivering a story that feels fresh to the reader from start to finish. The latter, in particular, is a triumphant accomplishment, given the amount of exceptionally well-trodden ground they are revisiting: World War II, the occupation, resistance, the lives of ordinary people. (There are at least two excellent miniseries devoted to life in the Channel Islands, to my knowledge, most recently Island at War.) There are no immense dramatic surprises or revelations, but also no cliches. (sorry, the accent aigu thing on my computer isn't working...:-)) It is a gentle book, revolving around the importance of friendship, particularly in the midst of life's worst experiences.<br /><br />All of the characters are real and vivid, with human flaws. But the sole evil-minded character -- an old crone on the island -- never really makes much of an appearance. So the focus lies instead on the myriad ways that people can rely on each other to help with everything from the mundane to the most major challenges that live deals out.<br /><br />I bought this with some wariness -- I'm always a bit cautious when a book gets very heavily hyped. Too sweet, too \\"coy\\" or precious -- these were just some of my fears. In particular because epistolary novels are very tricky beasts -- it's hard to make characters feel real when the author's only technique for disclosing events and personality is through letters of some kind. In this regard, the authors triumph yet again; instead of conducting a kind of \\"data dump\\" on the reader in the form of letters that have no purpose but to fill us in on character or \\"back story\\", each letter feels right, authentic.<br /><br />The highest praise I can give this novel is that it feels real -- as if these individuals lived, and I could somehow encounter them if I could go back in time. (Helene Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road, which gave me the same sensation, was made up of real letters by real people, in contrast.)<br /><br />A caveat for anyone looking for great literature: this isn't it. It isn't even 21st century Jane Austen. But it's a delightful novel, written with a delicate touch, revolving around compelling characters. It's one I expect to re-read frequently, and I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for another product from the authors.Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road, which gave me the same sensation, was made up of real letters by real people, in contrast.)

0375826726|5.0|Christopher Paolini writes lists. These lists are things that Eragon has done, and things Eragon needs to do. The first two novels felt like I was reading these lists, and although the lists were interesting to read, especially how Paolini's mind makes connections, they were definitely lists. While reading through Brisingr, I was looking for lists. I was dumbfounded as near the end of the book, I hadn't found any remnants of a list. I continued reading, and by the end of the book, there were no lists. Then I sat back and thought about it. There were lists! Throughout the entire book. However, this time, I couldn't see the lists. Paolini started out young, and while his skill at the art of creatively pulling together information, albeit not very original information, is dazzling, his writing hasn't always been very mature. Brisingr changes this. Brisingr's stories of honor, obligation, love, betrayal, and personal introspection have evolved beyond those of its predecessors, and Brisingr is amazing because of it.<br />Brisingr brings together (almost) all of the questions brought forth in the first two novels, and throughout the course of the book, answers them faithfully. Some of the answers are surprising, yet deep down, a careful reader knows that the answers were always there. Then, in a fashion true to the mythology of Alagaesia, presents new questions out of the old, and moves characters in new ways, all to set up the final march to Uru'baen, where Eragon and the Varden will face off against Galbatorix in an epic battle worthy of any of the Inheritance Cycle's influences.
B0015KO52S|3.0|Jack White is kind of an up-and-down fellow: he can put together some absolutely brilliant songs that really put you in the mood to rock, no matter how off-kilter it is, or he can end up in a rut.  As an example of this, I would posit that his most brilliant work (Meg of course is a creative non-factor) would be Elephant, Icky Thump, De Stijl, and Broken Boy Soldiers; all great albums that range from the super-catchy (Elephant) to the rather dissonant (Icky Thump), or the classically influenced, yet fresh (Broken Boy Soldiers). Sometimes, though, it just doesn't work; the White Stripes self-titled debut album, Get Behind Me Satan, and this album.  After the home-run of BBS, I was eagerly awaiting Consolers and picked it up on the enthusiastic recommendations of many friends. However, it just doesn't hit the same nerves as BBS; instead of the slow, rambling charm of BBS' best songs, it keeps rhythms we're much more accustomed to in classic rock, and the lyrics change from their unfocused, simple subject matter to more conventional themes, which are clearly Jack's weak spot. Where BBS could make a beautiful song about nothing more than hands, or the phase of the moon, Consolers tries to capture relationship blues almost exclusively. One can see why he's stuck to nonsensical, free-association lyrics for so long: when he tries to tell a story it crumbles.  As for the instrumental sound of this album, it is more structured than we are accustomed to from either the Raconteurs or White Stripes, with less of the solos and riffing that we all love to hear from Jack. The addition of horns are well-done, and fit with the bluesy composition. Unfortunately, all the songs blend together with both their theme and musical sound, and you'll be hard pressed to distinguish one from the other after you're done listening.  Overall, this album is unremarkable and weak in comparison to the majority of Mr. White's impressive aural resume. It lacks the catchiness, incredible solos, and silly charm of other album's songwriting. If you'd like to hear an album by Jack White that will appear more familiar and bluesy than his other work, buy this one, otherwise stick to the rest.

0679722610|5.0|One of the major pioneering works of the hardboiled detective genre, Red Harvest is also a nightmarish vision of a world thoroughly corrupted by capitalism in an era of crisis. Hammett has received plenty of attention for his brilliantly drawn characters, razor-sharp dialogue, and judicious use of humor, revulsion and violence in moving his plots along. The key character in Red Harvest, however, is not the unnamed \\"Continental Op\\" who narrates the tale but meglomaniacal Elihu Willsson, the mining magnate who transforms Personville into \\"Poisonville\\" through his insistance on retaining absolute power over his company town by unleashing murderous gangsters to crush the local labor movement when they go on strike after World War I. By the time the Op arrives on the scene the city has become a criminal cesspool engaged in every form of vice, and claiming Willsson's reform-minded son as its latest victim.<br /><br />No serious assessment of Red Harvest can fail to take into account the way in which it parallels the contemporary rise of fascism. Using violence to preserve the privileges of capitalist elites at the expense of any pretense of democracy or liberty, fascism's paramilitary brownshirts and the sharp-dressed gangsters in Red Harvest are brothers in arms. In his effort to \\"clean up\\" Personville, Hammett's Continental Op finds the only means of doing so is by exploiting the distrust, greed, and corruption of its gangsters and local government officials, a process that draws him into the same moral pit and from which he recoils by seeking to escape. While we continue to grapple with the corruptions of late capitalism, Hammett's work is as relevant in the 21st century as it was in 1929.

I would recommend this product to anyone who likes the movie, and to anyone who saw the Dark Knight who hasn't seen this movie yet, this is definitely the definitive version!

A letter comes to her from a man on Guernsey Island, inquiring about a book which has her name written inside the front cover.  Juliet's interest is piqued, and she begins correspondence with many of Guernsey's inhabitants, learning about the German occupation during the war.<br /><br />I thought the authors did a wonderful job in developing the tones of voice for the different characters, since this story is told through letters.  Everyone seemed very real and very endearing.  The war stories were very touching, some hilarious, others tragic.  I would love a sequel, and when I get a break from my studies, I would definitely love to learn more about the German Occupation of the Channel Islands.

B000008M1P|5.0|I always liked hard rock (more hard rock than true metal).  I always liked female vocalists.  I always have been supportive of female musicians and athletes.  So it shouldn't surprise anyone that I like Vixen.  But I like Vixen better than the Go Gos, and they are close to edging out the Bangles (my second favorite secular band) and Rachel Rachel (which could be called a Christian Vixen, except they aren't as good at rockin' as Vixen is).<br /><br />I actually learned about Vixen through MySpace.  While I was not surprised there was some turn over, I was when I discovered only one of the original band members was still there (Jan K.)  But that did not diminish how much I enjoyed the project.<br /><br />My favorite tracks (and yes, I liked them all) were \\"Edge Of A Broken Heart\\", \\"I Want You To Rock Me\\", \\"American Dream\\", \\"One Night Alone\\", \\"Love Made Me\\", \\"Waiting\\", and \\"Cruisin'\\".  7 out of 11 songs on my favorite tracks list?

B001AQO41E|5.0|I've been a fan of this film for over 20 years. My parents had the VHS and before that it was taped from TV. I own the 25th Anniversary edition, which I had not yet watched. I know Blu-Rays often are criticized for the lack of extras, but I must specifically comment here on the PQ and AQ.<br /><br />I absolutely love this film, for its storyline, characters and visual accomplishments achieved for its time period. I did not expect a quality transfer such as this one, when I popped the disc in. I purchased this at Target yesterday which had it at a price comparable to Amazon's, after tax, and with a temporary price reduction.<br /><br />I use a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma, Onkyo 605 receiver, Panasonic BD30K Blu player and Paradigm Speakers, on this particular set up.<br /><br />The picture is amazing! There are some areas where there is a bit of noise in the sky shots over \\"Cuesta Verde\\", the housing development. However, other than that, for a film that is 26 years old, the picture and sound are stunning. The colors really pop in this edition, and the sound during the paranormal phenomena is spectacular. Blacks and detail are very rich and the sound is thunderous when it should be, but even throughout the film, as it needs to be.<br /><br />The Digi-Book packaging is a neat little perk, as it adds some history, production notes and intewresting little tidbits. Although these can be found on the net, as well, for the same price and even cheaper than some other Blu-Rays, the packaging adds an extra incremental value.<br /><br />If you love this movie, the transfer is absolutely worth picking this up! If you just like it, give it a rent. I have 100's of HD DVD's and Blu-Rays, and this is one of the best transfers I've seen, of those films I have viewed. PQ: 4/5 AQ: 4/5. I am taking 1 point off, for the few instances of grain (sky, and one scene where there was a black line going up and down the picture in the film, not my tv), and the fact that the sound was not quite as powerful, as it could have been. Highly recommend!mmend!

0316172324|3.0|Malcolm blends storytelling and journalism into very interesting reading. Somehow the reading is not entirely satisfying, because there's really no point. Most readers take from the book that we can make decisions within a couple seconds and that can be more accurate than taking weeks or months to study the situation. Often it boils down to experience. At the same time, the book talks about how wrong our initial impressions can be, because of bias, stereotypes, and pressure.    So the lesson is that your initial impressions made within the first second or two can be dead on right...except when you're dead on wrong. Fun stories, though.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I first heard the song \\"Wish I had an Angel\\" in the movie \\"Alone in the Dark\\" with Christian Slater, and I bought this CD, this was my first cd of their's, and I fell in love with it, their sound is extremely remarkable.  I was kind of shocked when I heard thru the grapevine that Tarja was fired, because she has a different, and unique sound all her own, and the music just worked with her voice.  Annette is awesome, but Tarja is her own, and she own's it.  In this cd \\"Ghost Love Score\\", and the rest of the music on this cd has a unique Native American sound to it, and you can really appreciate it.  This is one of their greatest accomplishments.  Next to \\"Century Child\\" in which Tarja put's her own gothic spin to \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", well done...

B000URDEB0|5.0|I first heard Nightwish in the movie \\"Alone in the Dark\\" with \\"Christian Slater\\", and I've been in love with Nightwish ever since.  I bought the cd \\"ONCE\\" as my first album because of the song \\"Wish I had an Angel\\", then I bought \\"Dark Passion Play\\", and I just fell in love with the music.  They have that \\"GOTHIC, CHAMBER, and CELTIC\\" sound which I love, and the song \\"Meadows of Heaven\\" is amazing.  That song makes my spirit fly, I just take off.<br /><br />If you never been a fan of Nightwish, believe me, after hearing their cd's I am a #1 fan.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|Although the characters are real and the story based on true events, the author takes a good deal of liberty with the plot - this is a \\"what might have happened\\" vision of history and as such cannot be taken too seriously.    That said, it is an interesting depiction of 16th century England at the court of King Henry VIII, when position and power meant everything, it was very much a man's world and women were reduced to mere pawns to serve their advancement (either as wives or mistresses) and assure their descendance. All in all, I found the film entertaining, more so than the television serie, where the actors were less charismatic and somewhat unconvincing, especially Anne.     However, my favorite film on the subject remains \\"Anne of the thousand days\\", which is closer to the real story and far more believable as a whole, and Genevieve Bujold and Richard Burton deliver dynamite performances.
B001CTA1T8|5.0|Bring your kids, you parents, your grandparents even that movie snob who sees only indie flicks. This movie is a sheer delight from the first frame to the last.  Walt Disney merely confirms that it has the magic touch in creating a delightful movie that should appeal to every age level.<br /><br />You've not only got adorable talking dogs, but you've got lavish locations, great music, and a story line that keeps you constantly guessing and hoping for the fate of the main star: Chloe, the white, trembling, starry-eyed chihuahua. Some have questioned the logic of the plot--which traces the adventures of Chloe after she becomes lost in Mexico. This movie should be appreciated for what it is: a fluffy fantasy about the secret lives of dogs.<br /><br />Disney Studios have given this movie a plush, A plus production, with delightful performances from everyone--and that includes animals and humans.<br /><br />This is a movie that's attracting people back to see it every weekend--much like the phenomenal success of MAMA MIA.<br /><br />Bravo to Chloe, the chihuahua--and the rest of this delightful cast.dogs,
0618918248|3.0|I thought \\"The God Delusion\\" was informative and well-reasoned. I especially thought the information on the origin of scriptures was an eye-opener. Many religious people take everything in the bible and other holy books as fact, and that is a big part of what they base their faith on. However, Dawkins cites works by other scholars disputing the truthfulness of the scriptures. As this is not Dawkins' subject, I would be interested in reading more works by historians of the bible.    On the negative side, I thought the book was too long and tedious in sections, such as when talking about memes.     I also do not think Dawkins successfully made the case for religion causing evil, when, by his own admission, one of the worst mass murderers of the 20th century, Stalin, was an atheist. He states that religion provides people with a label to put on others to make them an out-group and justify commiting evil acts against them. But I think if it wasn't religion, people would just find another label. Even in the case of Al Qaida and the Taliban, I think if they were not religious, they would just base their destructive acts on something else--politics, tribal loyalties, etc.    And I thought the section on The Sanctity of Human Life--about abortion, the death penalty, and euthanasia--had nothing to do with the existence of God. It just provided a platform for Dawkins to expound on his personal viewpoints regarding these subjects. Also, in this section, he let his emotions take over rather than providing much in the way of good rational arguments either for abortion or against the death penalty (which are his views).     But overall, an interesting thought-provoking book.
B0017T0EA4|2.0|This is a re-packaging gimmick beyond belief. At the price being asked, you would think Carol would throw in some new material. Shame, shame Carol!
B000B6CODO|5.0|In a nutshell, the movie is about a predated, enchanted board game (as proven through the prologue where the previous players frantically dispatch of it almost a hundred years before our stories actually starts) placed into the hands of Alan Perish, a thirteen year old growing up in New England in 1969.  At first, to Alan and his friend Sarah, it seems ordinary, but with a roll of the dice, things change to the very worst.  The game play itself, including bats, monkeys, lions and other deadly elements actually become real, animated... and lethal.  Twenty-six years later, another pair of children get their hands on it, reactivating its dormant magic.  Alan and Sarah return, and the four of them vow to put an end to all the irreparable harm this game has caused for the, the town and their very lives.      I remember when I was the second grade, (almost twelve years ago) when my mother was having her book club at our house and my father took my sister and I out to the movies.  Honestly, I had no idea what Jumanji was (I saw like, a thirty second advertisement for the merchandised board game and maybe five seconds worth of the actual film) and had no idea what I was getting into.      Everyone in this section is dead right when they say this movie is dark on a massive scale.  Sorry, but a happy family film doesn't contain the concepts of murder, mayhem and intensified chaos.   Honestly, when I was at my local Metropolitan Theater when it first came out, I almost couldn't take it.  I wanted to either hide underneath my foldout seat or even resort to the classic juvenile excuse told during the rising action or climax of a film of this nature, also known as, \\"I have to go to the bathroom!\\"  Regardless of that, though, I just couldn't stop watching.  Maybe it was the mystery of how in the world the characters were going to get out of this catastrophic situation.  It could have been the special effects were revolutionary.  After all, in the mid-nineties, creating one hundredcomputer-generated special effects was almost on heard of (Independence Day was mostly stop-motion animation and Jurassic Park basically relied on actual animatronics, both with very few CGI involved) and looked so real.  But... the fact remained that this film was to be my obsession for about one quarter of my elementary schooled life.     This week (in the middle of my third year of college) I found my old VHS tape of this particular film while in pursuit of another (my major is film studies and production) and decided, meh... what the heck.  A little nostalgia never hurt, right?     Instead of just watching it for pure enjoyment, I could now analyze it in a more critical and more understanding way.  I thought it wasn't going to do much for me, but (dated family film, not much chance of finding any true thematic qualities) but nevertheless, that didn't appear to be the case.  Unlike the other popular live-action family films within ten years of this film coming out (the Indian in the Cupboard, Homeward Bound, Honey I Shrunk the Kids), this one seemed to have deeper meaning in how events shape the lives of our youth.     When Alan returns home, he see's the beautiful town he had once called his home (a more obvious example would be the statute of his family patron, once a shining beacon in the middle of a beautiful and lush green park, now pretty much a rusted graffiti tagged eyesore, centered on top of what has become something akin to scorched earth) now residing as a dying city reeking bankruptcy and homeless civilians.   This clearly demonstrates what happens when one avoids responsibility, and how it affects not only you, but also the people directly involved with your life.   And the fact that the game continues to cause additional mayhem and destruction demonstrates how continuously fleeing responsibility can only get worse and worse.     And for those who noticed--no... it's not coincidence that the protagonist's father, is the same actor as the homicidalhunter Van Pelt (who appears to be nothing short of an evil entity seemingly taken from Richard Connell's short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\"--wow... the irony!).  The hunter is actually a living, breathing metaphor of how difficult it can be to face and overcome the harshest facts of life--aka, dealing with the strained relationship of Alan and his father.  This sort of plays on the same technique the original play of Peter Pan demonstrated when Captain Hook was the same actor as Wendy, John and Michael's father.     And if in the event you're juggling between Jumanji and that \\"other\\" movie about an enchanted board game, \\"trust me\\"--leave Zathura on the shelf or in the bargain bin, where it belongs.  For unlike its predecessor, Zathura (which I only watched because it debuted on my prepaid additional cable sometime back) has the flash, the action and special effects that made Jumanji what it was--but unlike the original, its main purpose seems to be to only entertain and has absolutely no thematic qualities to speak of.  Furthermore, any morale that you see in it is pretty much shoved down your throat and leaves no room for any real progress in mental contemplation.   Now, let's leave this nonsense behind and continue.     While there are some tiny flaws with the acting and screenplay--there really isn't much to dock this rating in the slightest.  My only warning is, if you are going to watch with your family, make sure your child, grandchild, little brother/sister, whatever is \\"at least\\" in the upper elementary, as many scenes might prove to be too intense.        So let me close by saying \\"for those who wish to seek to find a way to leave your world behind\\" give this movie a go and remember what made family film so powerful just a decade before.

0767827791|3.0|Picnic is the story of a drifter (William Holden), an ex-football hero who has never had trouble with women. He feels doomed to repeat his father's life, a life of alcoholism and jail. When he stumbles upon an old college friend, things seem to be looking up, that is until he meets his friend's girlfriend (Kim Novak). The sexual tension is outrageous between them and they don't do a good job at covering it up. Naturally, this spells problems for the drifter and the girl who desires to be something more than just a pretty face.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie just doesn't hit the spot. The acting is melodramatic across the board, a fault of the director, I suspect. The women suddenly throw themselves onto beds for a good long cry or they exaggeratedly turn away from the men they love. It is all too hokey and unrealistic to do the film any justice. Fortunately, the personalities of the actors make this movie worth seeing anyway. Aside from Holden and Novak, Susan Strasberg and Rosalind Russell make memorable appearances in supporting roles. Strasberg is youthful and charming and Russell is overbearing and desperate (appropriately to the character).
B00000JPYQ|5.0|One of the great mysteries in the annals of heavy rock is why UFO never became a big band on par with Aerosmith, Ted Nugent and KISS. At their peak in the late seventies, this band had it all...stage chops, anthemic songs, great chemistry and a dazzling (and unpredictable) lead guitarist. When Michael Schenker left the band after their magnum opus, the live `Strangers in the Night', UFO never regained the momentum that might have made them superstars. Though the band would continue to make high quality hard rock into the early `80's--the magic was lost! As it stands, \\"Strangers' is still considered one of the all-time greats and the primary reason why UFO is still highly regarded by current hard rock musicians and some diehard fans. The band's best material was captured at the height of their performance powers and for many, `Strangers' remains UFO's greatest hits (much like sister album `Live and Dangerous' from Thin Lizzy). \\"Lights Out\\", \\"Out in the Street\\", \\"Too Hot to Handle\\", \\"Shoot Shoot\\" and of course Michael's guitar hero barnstormer \\"Rock Bottom\\". For a notorious rowdy (and drunk/drugged) collection of blokes, UFO was all business and must have made the headliners on the `Obsession' American tour piss their pants! UFO could do it all, speed metal (\\"Let it Roll\\"), country (\\"I'm a Loser\\") and epic Zeppelinesque balladry (\\"Love to Love\\") it is a damn shame such talent wasn't rewarded with megastar status. Being a UFO fan is like being a member of an exclusive club....and `Strangers' was our gold card.
0385504209|4.0|As a mystery, well, there are better. In the competition for plot twists, historical fiction, art, or cryptography, there's better out there than the Da Vinci Code. But it is a page-turner, and with that excitement succeeds in dramatically raising curiosity about two major questions: (1) what is belief and how does it affect history? and (2) is the image of women in religion timeless, or was it consciously manufactured at certain key periods in history?<br /><br />One need not be religious in order to care about the first question. And one need not be a radical feminist to consider the second. After all, some basic facts of male-female relations are still with us no matter how modern we get: men rule the world, and declare the wars. Only women bear children, including the boys who will be men. And women are not some obscure minority, but 50% of the human experience.<br /><br />So if a thriller sprinkled with (partially accurate) historical references is what it takes to get people to examine their beliefs, research history, and apply the results to improving life for the men, women, and children around them, that will be a respectable achievement for this work of popular literature.

0321344758|5.0|I can think of very few sites that couldn't be improved by applying the principles in this book. It does what \\"Web Sites That Suck\\" attempts to do, but instead of giving examples of horrible web sites that are most likely beyond fixing, it uses examples of pretty decent sites that just need a little help. I assume the vast majority of sites fall into the latter category, which is why this book is so useful.    The chapter on do-it-yourself usability testing is a real gem -- worth the price of the whole book and then some.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This cd in an absolute classic. It may not have as many hit singles as previous three Coldplay albums, but it works as an album better than those albums(parachutes is close though). The title track, strawberry swing, and death and all of his friends are three of the best songs Coldplay has ever written.    I recommend Coldplay to anyone that can appreciate beautiful melodies in the mode of The Beatles because to me nobody out there writes melodies as good as Coldplay. Chris has a real gift. The music is beautiful as well. Their lyrics, on the other hand, are their real weakness, but they're still serviceable. Ultimately, there is a reason why this band is one of the most successful bands of the 21st century: they write great songs that many types of people can enjoy. Buy it.
0596527055|5.0|At this point I can't say much that the other reviewers haven't already. Berkun makes a case study out of innovators and their innovations, exposing the real history behind the developments. There is no such thing as \\"Eureka!\\"...breakthroughs occur only after many long hours of development have been racked up (even in such \\"accidental\\" discoveries like the microwave oven), from you and all of your predecessors, all the way back to when we first crawled out of the ocean.<br /><br />So much surrounding innovation is beyond the control of the innovator. Berkun takes 10 myths and picks them apart, piece by piece....this is an absolute must read for people in technical fields as well as basement inventors. It should set you straight before you go off and (foolishly) try to change the world with a (insert fancy new widget here). I found the book to be humorous and refreshing. I wish I would have come across this book before I started my graduate education, it would have changed my temperament to be more realistic when it comes to cutting-edge research at an earlier time (I got there anyway, but now I am old and cynical).<br /><br />And for the record, this is not a cookbook for innovation. There is no such thing...and reading this book should explain to you why. Also, I second the comment about the colophon being worth the price of the book.

0060920084|4.0|This is the third Bryson book that I've read in three months; Bill's persona has become my friend.  In fact, I felt like I was in the back seat during his travels around America.  I'm so old that I have been to most of the places where \\"we\\" traveled.  Bryson's wit makes small town USA interesting, and sometimes sad for the \\"good old days\\" when our communities resembled our collective character. There is some disdain for big box chain stores and restaurants that dot every landscape and meld our communities into boring familiarity regardless of where we go.  \\"We\\" had similar feelings about most of the places.  I enjoyed the ride.  \\"We\\" laughed a lot.

I haven't had the chance to sit down and watch any of the episodes at all but I will because i want to know what all the fuss is about.  Anyways, men...Get this for your wife/girlfriend and she'll love you enough to not bother you when you watch sports center or play video games. I highly recommend this product.

1402720602|4.0|This is one of three books I bought to help me build my first guitar, the other two (Guitar making, Cumpiano and Natelson, and Step by Step Guitar making, Wills) are very competent and worth buying also, but lack the same clarity of explanation and high quality colour photos describing the step-by step process. I am halfway through the guitar making process now, but my experience thus far of this excellent book leaves me in no doubt I will successfully complete the project.  Any gripes? Yes! In 1999, NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft crashed into Mars because the manufacturers had unknowingly confused Imperial and metric units during construction. To quote from Bogdanovich's book; \\"Now glue the Indian rosewood veneer (2 mm thick and approximately 3 inches x 7 1/2 inches)...\\". Throughout the book, measurements in inches expressed as both fractions and decimals (0.775 inches) are freely mixed with mm metric measurements. For heaven's sake, Mr. Bogdanovich, and your publishers, Sterling, get this fixed in the second edition, either sticking with imperial, or preferably, metric, avoiding fractional measurements!  ....but the book is still very, very worth buying, and I don't think first time guitar makers will be disappointed!
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore's Watchmen is probably one of the greatest graphic novels I have ever read. Much like 300 or Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, Watchmen is able to provide emotional catharsis to the reader, something naysayers would say that the graphic novel is unable to do, and elevates the graphic novel into a true art form.<br /><br />I suggest Watchmen for people who liked 1984 and similar works, since it also deals with the issue of what someone is able to do with unlimited, unchecked power. I also suggest it for parents who liked watching The Incredibles with their children.
0060752610|5.0|When international award winners (Nobel laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners) are asked how they came to such remarkable achievements they usually make references to standing on the shoulders of giants. In essence, they pay tribute to the trailblazing giants who mentored their progress.  Consequently, if you're trying to gain a clearer understanding of their genius simply read the works they read.<br /><br />For instance, for a better understanding of politicians and what we commonly refer to as their unscrupulous behavior, read The Prince, by Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli.  For a better understanding of classic capitalism and the foundational attitude of the wealthy, study An Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations, by Adam Smith.  To gain a comprehensive understanding of Adam Smith the man, you have to read The Wealth of Nations in conjunction with his other famous work, The Theory of Moral Sentiment.  For a clearer understanding of man's quest for validation here on earth read Viktor Frankl's, Man's Search for Meaning.<br /><br />All of these people and their works are accepted as the pinnacle of greatness in their fields.  If you were to add to that list, The Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham, you may very well have found a blue print for the successful manipulation of life. According to Warren Buffet, \\"The Intelligent Investor is by far the best book on investing ever written.\\"<br />If the world were to recruit one of its greatest investors to instruct the rest of us in balanced, diversified portfolio management, we'd start with Ben Graham.  For those interested in exploring wealth creation and personal portfolio management, there is absolutely no better financial or philosophical starting point.<br /><br />Even if you don't plan on managing your own portfolio, wouldn't it be nice to know what questions to ask?

No doubt the first Elizabeth film took its share of liberties with historical fact, but at least it was a serious examination of how a powerful and resourceful woman came to power, maintained her position, and the price she paid for it.  This sequel is a combination of soap opera and Errol Flynn-type swashbuckler, peopled by one-dimensional characters.
0316067601|5.0|Add me to the 500 or so people who thought this is a five-star book.  From page one, you zoom through a compelling true story of how our Navy Seals wage war, despite the disgusting lack of support they receive from their own politicians and the media abck home.  Luttrell takes you through SEAL training and utterly convinces you that these are truly supermen.  Thank God they're on our side.  And one of the most important parts of their success is their warrior brotherhood.  Make no mistake:  Navy SEALS are overachievers who never quit and who undergo the most rugged training in the world.  Sure, this book has a lot of braggadocio, ego, wise cracks and anti-liberal cant in it, but these men are mostly from small-town America and they salute a sense of values that their snidely sophisticated critics -- you know, the ones these guys protect --couldn't understand in a million years.  This is a must read!
B001DXS4E2|5.0|I've watched both the spotless B&W version with commentary and the dazzling color version of the Universal 3-disc (including CD) edition of \\"Holiday Inn\\" and I am very impressed.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the film for a while, the very high points are the song \\"White Christmas\\" and its reprise and two of Fred Astaire's more unforgettable numbers: a solo dance with firecrackers and a falling down drunk number that has to be seen to be believed. But to be fair, all the numbers are memorable, from the classic \\"You're Easy to Dance With\\" to the 18th Century-influenced \\"I Can't Tell a Lie\\" and the blackface hommage to Abraham Lincoln, \\"Abraham\\", one of Irving Berlin's best \\"unknown\\" songs. The two underrated female counterparts (Marjorie Reynolds and Virginia Dale) are also quite nimble and copacetic.<br /><br />This edition has kept all the extras of the 2006 Special Edition: \\"A couple of Song and Dance Men\\", a 50 min double biography of Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire that has a lot of exciting footage from many of their movies not yet on DVD, hosted by record producer Ken Barnes and Ava Astaire; \\"All Singing - All Dancing\\", a 7 min demonstration of how the dance numbers were filmed and put together (dancing to a pre-recorded soundtrack + live recording of the tapping sound with hidden microphones); a very thorough multiple commentary with input from vintage Crosby and Astaire interviews; and a well-preserved theatrical trailer.<br /><br />It also includes a 12-band CD collection of the film's songs with Crosby and Astaire (from Geffen Records) presented in a cute miniature cardboard 78-RPM sleeve - a genuine collector's item, and a 7 min making-of docu of the color version with Barry Sandrew.<br /><br />The Legend Films color version, in my opinion, reaches yet another summit in verisimilitude, the skin tones having been somehow improved upon and the indoor/outdoor sets and costumes being handled with the same level of maniacal authenticity as in \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". It actually looks better than a lot of color films of the era and really strives for that saturated Technicolor look, but in a somehow more \\"relaxed\\" presentation, as B&W films obviously didn't have to try as hard to dazzle the eye in every department and every second. Still, I had to gawk and stare at a scene where Astaire is hurriedly packing a tangled bunch of vari-colored neckties, wondering at the complexity of the colorization process involved in such a puny but mind-bogling detail. The whole film - with the nicely contrasting exception of a patriotic B&W documentary montage of the USA's entry into WWII shown at the Inn - is bathed in the warm glow of intimate indoor lighting alternating with more gaudy flood-lit and heart-stopping dance numbers. You have absolutely no idea what \\"oomph\\" means until you've seen Virginia Dale's sequined night-blue dress shimmy and shake in the \\"You're Easy To Dance With\\" number. I found it really hard to come back to the B&W version after that, except for the commentary and the other extras on Disc 1. Yes, I am that shallow.<br /><br />Both versions are pretty much at the maximum bitrate throughout. The whole experience can only be described as sheer, unadulterated joy and an unparalleled time-travel piece.than a lot of color films of the era and really strives for that saturated Technicolor look, but in a somehow more \\"relaxed\\" presentation, as B&W films obviously didn't have to try as hard to dazzle the eye in every department and every second.

I literally lost hours of sleep reading this book and enjoyed every minute.  Never once did I think that the author was stretching or reaching or manipulating the story.  The story throughout was how I would want it to go and I was happy because of that.  My only regret is that Bella's story is over and how much I enjoyed seeing her as the strong hero figure instead of the \\"pawn\\".

B001DUJNGS|2.0|'Seven Lives Many Faces' is undoubtedly the weakest album of Enigma's otherwise brilliant career.  Apart from a few decent songs (e.g. the title track), the album sounds uninspired and downright boring.  As a matter of fact, the album is too derivative of older releases; there's very, very little that's original here.  Furthermore, Cretu doesn't truly develop the few good ideas he has!  \\"De Ja Vu\\", for instance, sounds like a very promising track, but it dies away after a mere three minutes or so.  Save your money -- at least until Cretu gets it right again.

0618918248|5.0|I have read Dawkins' other books about genes and evolution, The Selfish Gene and The Third Chimpanzee. I never knew he was such an avid Atheist. His other books so greatly expanded my understanding of evolution and how the world works but I wasn't sure how much I could learn about Atheism, since I'm such a non-believer already.    Dawkins raised and trounced every theist argument I've ever heard. Great for Atheists who want some debating fodder.    This book focuses more on Christianity and other monotheistic religions than on philosophical theism/atheism arguments. I left with my semi-deist beliefs still intact because they were not addressed in this book. But how can one book address the millions and millions of possible gods/belief systems? This one just goes after the most prevalent and dangerous of the current belief systems.    Dangerous? This book explains why, and pretty convincingly. If you are an atheist sitting on the sidelines, this book may make you want to get up in the mix and volunteer your time. Get this book! You won't regret it.
B0008ENICU|5.0|You don't have to be female to get a kick out of this comedy, but if you are, you'll recognize many of the archetypes portrayed in this over-the-top send-up of romances of the '30's. Virtually every female actress who WAS anybody in Hollywood at the time was in this thing, and it's fun to watch for your favorites.<br />The plot is stereotypical (on purpose!) but the wisecracks are crisp and delivered with that unmatched speed that keeps the viewer thinking.<br />Nary a boring moment in the whole film!<br />The joke is: while there are no males at all in this film, the whole thing is about the MEN in their lives!<br />It's great fun, and well worth adding to your film library.<br />(PS. Don't miss the incredible, jaw-dropping fashion show. I was on the floor!)
B000W91RUG|5.0|Let me preface by saying that Creationists should not be confused by the title of this show.<br /><br />On one of the corporate controlled network channels, tucked away quietly at 8pm on Monday evenings, is a new piece of brilliance called \\"The Big Bang Theory.\\" Now most of us have stopped looking to the networks for intelligent entertainment that is based on quality writing. The only reason I saw this was because I was visiting my mother on her farm in the middle of no where where neither cable nor DSL has snaked up the mountains and across the fields. I watched Sheldon and Leonard for the first time through the snowy reception of days of yore and perhaps it is my age-perhaps it is that I work in theatre and music- that I caught onto the inside joke of our central characters first names: Sheldon Leonard was one of the pioneers of television situation comedies. The Sheldon and Leonard in our show are two men in their twenties whose combined I.Q.'s are 360. They're \\"Star Trek\\" loving, Halo playing PhD research physicists at Cal Tech. They share an apartment on the third floor of a building with a perpetually broken elevator. The two hundred pound transvestite across the hall has moved out and is replaced by a beautiful, sweet young woman from Nebraska who is a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory. Her name is Penny and she is tolerant and wise and, mostly, normal. This makes us bond with her instantly. Sheldon is incapable of dealing with anything that isn't logic based and Leonard is starting to explore the world outside of his lab and his lap-top. In a rare moment of understanding, Sheldon says, \\"We're not through with her, are we?\\" to which Leonard says, \\"Our children will be both smart AND beautiful.\\"<br /><br />The supporting characters are outstandingly developed: Howard, a Jewish, Casanova wanna-be works as an engineer at Cal-Tech where some of his work orbits Saturn's moons and help to keep the Hubble Telescope on point. He's the black sheep of their group. Is this because he still lives with his mother (a faceless voice screaming a la Constanza from the other room)? Is it because he hits on women with sickeningly nauseating form? Because he is and engineer and not a physicist? No. It's because he only has a Masters Degree and did not begin graduate school until after he was eighteen. The fourth of their group is an Indian genius named Raj who is incapable of speaking with women to the point where he often must go hungry in restaurants. The four of them have their lives scripted out together and all is in balance until the Pilot brings Penny into their lives and Leonard-expertly played by Johnny Galecki-begins to learn about love.<br /><br />The direction, acting and photography is all brilliant but it is the writing that makes this a television show worthy of FX, Showtime or HBO. (And, perhaps, history) The fact that it's CBS should be ignored until you've seen it. And then, as time goes by, perhaps we can begin to expect more from CBS than we've seen throughout the dark years of unscripted television (Or as Jordan McDeere called it, \\"Illiterate Programming\\", thanks Mr. Sorkin) and now, perhaps after a decade of watching nearly naked men and women eating insects, entrails and pig feces, or watching human devastation as mass entertainment (thanks, Ani) we can creep from behind our DVD towers and carefully unplug our iPods to once more risk our ever-fragile need for intelligent and classy entertainment in order to watch \\"The Big Bang Theory\\". I recommend-as I always do-the price of the DVD over waiting until 8pm on Monday evenings,as television commercials are simply a whole different essay unto themselves.<br /><br />This is outstanding television and everyone who has anything to do with producing it should be very proud. I thank you for being part of this Renaissance. I thank my Mom for pointing it out to me.

0765316897|5.0|This is a series for the ages.    Not since The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan in 1993 have I read any book with such ferocious speed fueled by immense intrigue and excitement; the plot, magic system, and the pure art of making the puzzles click into place in your mind as you turn page by page at 3AM... I can absolutely now say that A Memory of Light is in good hands.      After four nights of little sleep, I finally put this down with tears of ultimate contentment and a hint of sadness.  If I can, I would force Sanderson to write 12 books of Mistborn.  The story is that good.  If only he had a flare for Jordan's world description and character building, I can imagine at least 6 books that fleshes out lovely Vin, Elend, Ham, Breeze, and co to great complexity, thus making the ending so much more enjoyable.  Regardless, as each puzzle clicked into place, aided by the excellent narrative of one of the my favorite characters to start each chapter, and as the world stormed furiously towards its end, I felt that I came to love the characters and what they represent.      I fully disagree with another review:  I love prolonged, detailed endings that leaves little doubt in your mind.  Hero of Ages fulfills this happily, for the most part, but not enough!  All good things come to an end.  Hero's ending was shocking, yet at the same time exceedingly fulfilling as it ties up all loose ends, major and minor plots, and explains most questions up to this point.      As with finishing any other great work, I now sit here, content yet feeling empty because the series is complete.  To use a line from the book...     How have I ever lived without Mistborn?    *Edit 10/22/08*  Brandon Sanderson IS writing more of Mistborn!!!  His blog at [...] and also his posts on his favorite forum confirms this--at least one more trilogy of Mistborn, set possibly within 200 years from the end of Hero of Ages!  Also, he mentioned that a trilogy set in the distant future is also possible.      For those of you that haven't heard the word, Sanderson is currently in the midst of a US book tour, so visit his website and go support this amazingly talented, young author at your local bookstore; I know I will.  Some of you might wonder about 2 metals...check his blog.  =)    Finally, I feel that RJ can rest comfortably with AMOL in such good hands.  Now I want to see more world building, Brandon!

This book is great for toddlers learning how to speak and for younger school age children because of the fun, busy, bountiful world that Mr. Scarry has created.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|This movie is as good as it gets in modern moviemaking.  Daniel Day-Lewis, our greatest living actor, adds his greatest character portrayal yet to a seemingly unlimited range of characters past. He plays Daniel Plainview an oil wildcatter during the age of the post-Reconstruction \\"Robber Barons.\\"    Not all of the Robber Barons were financial wizards like Jay Gould or conniving accounting monopolists like John D. Rockefeller, unethically stealing the profits of the hard working entrepreneurs who made the great oil and mineral discoveries of the time.  Daniel represents the driven, rugged individualist who resisted and defeated Rockefeller and the railroads' attempts to reap the fortune of his almost literally back-breaking efforts.    But in his quest, struggle and ultimate financial success Plainview pays a heavy price. The brutal, ruthless life he leads to attain his ambition for wealth leaves him resembling more a denizen of nature  than a resident of the human race. Whether he lost his soul in his childhood, in his quest, or never had one in the first place, is for the viewer to decide.    The scene with his \\"brother\\", Henry, is truly chilling when Daniel first reveals his brutal, misanthropic nature. Only Daniel Day-Lewis could deliver such blood curdling dialogue in that scene; slowly, in a philosophical manner explaining to Henry his hateful feelings toward all others with a fatalistic smile on his face.  He is a man comfortable in a skin in which many others would not be.  Kevin J. O'Connor's portrayal of Henry is outstanding as a desperate soul who never betrays Daniel, and is as loyal as a brother, but dies at Daniel's hand.    Daniel, as is shown throughout the movie, has a very perverse view of family and loyalty.  The development of his relationship with his adoptive son, H.W., is the clearest view into Daniel's character and ultimately renders the final verdict on Daniel's lifelong quest for wealth. Daniel's hardened and embittered nature is never shown more pointedly, and brutally, than in his final scene with H.W. (\\"a [...]in a basket!\\"). It is the savagely destructive psychological counterpart to the physical destruction Daniel wreaks in the final scene with Eli Sunday, the \\"false prophet\\".      Paul Dano as Eli Sunday, the greedy charismatic preacher, has received many accolades for his performance.  It is good, though not as good as O'Connor's \\"Henry\\" or the young H.W. (Dillon Freasier).     The main problem is not so much Dano's performance as his character's physical appearance.  Day-Lewis ages slowly but markedly through the thirty-five year period of the movie.  Dano, however, looks exactly the same age in the final confrontation in the bowling alley as he does when he first encounters Daniel at Eli's family dinner table.      There is also a scene later in the movie, some time after the scene at the family dinner table, in which Daniel beats and humiliates Eli in front of others.  It is almost a cinematic non-sequitur since the tension and rivalry between the two has not built to the point to justify the scene.    Regardless, those two items of criticism are slight in the context of a truly great movie.  The cinematography and the musical score lend greatly to its dark atmospherics. It is encouraging to see that it was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson whose previous undistinguished work includes the voyeuristically juvenile \\"Boogie Nights\\" and the embarrassing attempt at romantic comedy, \\"Punch Drunk Love\\".    It does shows that an artist can grow beyond the exploitative and immature sides of Hollywood cinema as he matures.  It undoubtedly helped Thomas to have Daniel Day-Lewis as the star, rather than an Adam Sandler.  This is Day-Lewis's movie and he is the best.    I have used the word \\"brutal\\" on a number of occasions in this review.  The era of the Robber Barons was just that.  This movie effectively conveys the history you may read about the era and the unforgiving state of nature thatproduced men like Daniel Plainview.      As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the Plainview character is \\"loosely\\" based on a character named Vern Roscoe in the novel \\"Oil,\\" written by Upton Sinclair. Sinclair's fictional character, in turn, was \\"loosely\\" based on a real person, named Edward L. Doheny.  He is profiled in Wikipedia if you would like more information about him.    All such \\"loose\\" associations are irrelevant in a great movie. Anderson and Daniel Day-Lewis have produced a cinematic masterpiece. It will be considered a classic in due time because of the timelessness of its theme and the greatness of its performances.     I'm finished.
0525478183|5.0|It had been months and months and months since i had sat down and read a book all the way through in a matter of hours.  I always brushed it off to having, work, school, homework, blah blah blah but Paper Towns finally changed all that.  John Green writes amazing characters who you can achingly  relate to on one level and then on the other level want to scream and shake them! It's perfect.    this book is more than just an amazing story thats funny and heartbreaking and adventurous and smart(to hell with grammar i love this book) but it makes you stop and think about your own life and your own relationships with the people around you.  Makes you take a moment to think about how you see yourself, your friends and family, and how you put yourself out into the world and if thats who you really are.    Its a really amazing book, a re-reader for sure.    Don't guess twice, just purchase \\"Paper Towns.\\"

B000002MTR|4.0|Listening to this album for the first time in literally 13 years, I am shocked at how much I enjoy it.  I remember liking this early on in High School, but as with a lot of things I enjoyed back then, I imagined it not holding up over the years.  Plus, since then, I've stopped enjoying Blood Sugar Sex Magik, their most famous and (at least on Rate Your Music) most highly rated album.    This album has little of the funk that ended up boring me with Blood Sugar Sex Magik, just enough to keep the sound interesting.  Instead, it has a lot of the fuzzy guitars that were prevalent in mid-90's Alternative music.  The songs are quirky, the sound changes from track to track, and the album is almost heavy at times.  It has an enjoyable experimental feel to it.    I was intending to listen to this album as a trip down memory lane, but I think I'm going to put it on a semi-regular rotation.

0143113100|4.0|I bought [[ASIN:0143113100 The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science (James H. Silberman Books)]] after seeing Dr Norman Doige interviewed on TV. The idea that the human brain is capable of change and adaptation well into old age fascinated me and I wanted to learn a bit more about this.    There's no question that Norman Doige is a good and thorough writer who makes sure his claims are backed up by good research. On the down side I felt he laboured too much on his point about neuroplasticity as if the reader constantly needed reminding.    The anecdotes he describes at the beginning of chapters are wonderful and inspiring but the sometimes long and complicated descriptions of research had me flipping quickly through the pages to get to the next chapter.    If I were able to make a request it would be that Dr Doige include a chapter that neatly summarizes some of the practical things we can do to exercise our brains into old age.    Having said all this, The Brain That Changes Itself is an excellent blend of self help and good research that is easily read and absorbed.

B000EWBKK8|1.0|I enjoyed the film and would rate it 4/5 stars.  However, this review is of the product itself - the film's Blu-ray disc edition.  I have a Sony receiver, and watched the (Sony!) Blu-ray disc on my Sony PS3.    The picture is great, but the sound mix is AWFUL.  50% of the time people are whispering their dialogue and you have to crank up the volume.  The other 50% of the time, the soundtrack/explosions/other sound effects are so loud you have to really dial back the sound.  It's as if the sound engineer had two buttons on his mixer - \\"quiet\\" and \\"loud\\" - with no dynamic range in between.      Watching this movie was like watching a television show that only included used car ads.... \\"whisper whisper BUY A NEW CAR NOW AT JOE'S CAR PALACE whisper whisper whisper.\\"    Completely inexcusable.  DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|The Jungle Book is one of those Disney classics that I never ever get tired of watching! It was the first ever Disney cartoon that my parents got me when I was a child. The characters in this masterpiece are wonderful and each and every one of them has a unique style and personality. Kudos to Rudyard Kipling for writing this beautiful story that will live on in our hearts for many years to come!
B000W9DTG6|5.0|Ocean11 and 12 did not have wide screen viewing. Ocean13 did. I DID NOT WANT A WIDE SCREEN DVD. I have a regular TV. How do I return this DVD for one that is not wide screen? Maybe you could just send me another one that is for regular TV and I can give this one away. Thank You.

B000000132|5.0|Ever since the \\"punk revolution\\" turned critics away from what they heard as the pomposity of the progressive rock of the 1970s, Renaissance have been generally ignored by the music press and others and when discussed seen as a symbol of the worst aspects of the 1970s. Even in a book I read that attempted to reconsider progressive rock Renaissance were derided as romantics who idealised a long-gone age on grounds of their lyrics - some of which were seen as supportive of the ancient feudal culture of Europe.<br /><br />It really surprised me - born in 1977 three years after \\"Turn of the Cards\\" came out - to find how well-known Renaissance were in their own time at least on the East Coast of the United States, where they were a major drawcard on college campuses.<br /><br />Listening to \\"Turn of the Cards\\" today, it actually sounds more visionary than dated (as progressive rock is supposed to). Opener \\"Running Hard\\" has a piano line that purists no doubt consider too close to classical music, but the drumbeat is so simple that accusations of excessive virtuosity are groundless. The lyrics express a quiet desperation for a lost innocence, a common theme at the time, but hardly are as backward-looking as critics have suggested and indeed express the most genuine sadness.<br /><br />\\"I Think of You\\" is, contrastingly, quite pure pop, but is so romantic and poetic it clearly stands out from the crowd, and Haslam's voice is rivalled in its eroticism only by Essra Mohawk on \\"Primordial Lovers\\". The third track, \\"Things I Don't Understand\\" is the most \\"progressive\\" song here with its multiple parts and Haslam trying a less melodic vocal style. At times it is not easy to follow, but like everything Renaissance did it has a beauty that compares to the best of the \\"pastoral\\" singer/songwriters and in the middle Haslam anticipates [[ASIN:B000002MQ8 Lisa Gerrard's chanting]] by fifteen years.<br /><br />The second side - as indeed on [[ASIN:B000006X8V Ashes Are Burning]] - is markedly darker than the first. \\" Black Flame\\" is the nearest thing to conventional \\"rock\\" here but the unsettling chants and the quiet-to-loud dynamics - though not with the emotion of 1990s post-rock or indeed [[ASIN:B000000HTL Van der Graaf Generator]] - are enough to make a listener want to listen again and again despite the sense of despair. This sense is compounded by lyrics that in the most utterly poetic manner known express the futility of fighting in Vietnam. \\"Cold Is Being\\", in which poet/lyricist Betty Thatcher adapts [[ASIN:B000K8KO3A Tomaso Albioni]], is a stark and deep meditation on ecological catastrophe that manages to be more effective than anything on the topic.<br /><br />\\"Turn of the Cards\\" closes with its centrepiece, the Solzhenitsyn tribute \\"Mother Russia\\", where Haslam's beautiful voice perfectly matches the serious, sober music about Stalinist repression. John Tout's piano and the orchestration on \\"Mother Russia\\" are so like Tori Amos' [[ASIN:B000002JIW Winter]] (itself a masterpiece) that one images Tori must have listened when young. The quiet interlude expresses with simple folk accompaniment the void that Stalinist repression produced like no other piece.<br /><br />No doubt the \\"punk\\" and rap revolutions have made music like \\"Turn of the Cards\\" with its romanticism, poetry and classical borrowings completely uncool. Yet, beneath this veneer is music of a soft simplicity that is as dark and brooding as anything in more fashionable genres and which many later female artists - no doubt without ever hearing it - tried to emulate. \\"Turn of the Cards\\" is beyond all else a record that requires people to discount purism and prejudice to reveal a genuine classic.rkedly darker than the first. \\" Black Flame\\" is the nearest thing to conventional \\"rock\\" here but the unsettling chants and the quiet-to-loud dynamics - though not with the emotion of 1990s post-rock or indeed [[ASIN:B000000HTL Van der Graaf Generator]] - are enough to make a listener want to listen again and again despite the sense of despair.

B0017MO10U|4.0|If you like sg-1 and the adventures dealing with time travel, this movie is quite enjoyable.  Yes, some of the old sequences are there (Teal'c as first prime but wants to be free), but, new twists with Vala and Ba'al.  The story still leaves open the idea that other Goaul'd may be around, but the last major god has been vanquished.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is something that will really get you moving and hurting! It's great. I am usually a stationary person and I do not like to go to a gym because I feel self-concious. I got this video hoping I would be able to get a good work out at home. I was right! I really like how the DVD is set up with three intensity levels to continually push you to the next level. It gave me a sense of accomlishment every time I completed a 20 minute work out and the next day, I was reminded of the progress I was making because of the aches and pains in my muscles. Lovely. I recommend this for anyone that wants an amazing work out at home without having to spend extra money on accessories. All you need to complete the work outs in this video is a couple of hand weights!
B001E75QGG|5.0|I missed this at the theaters so I wasn't expecting much after reading a lot of negative reviews.  I liked it.  It was mindless fun that made me forget about all the crap that's going on in the world for a couple of hours.  Nice blu-ray picture too.

B00064VR0W|5.0|I was absolutely thrilled. I have never owned a Rod Stewart album, but have loved listening to his unique voice. This compilation of different type songs (rock, melodies, ballads, etc.) at the live concert is fabulous. He is certainly entertaining and a world class legend. If you like this guy, you will love his live performance. He is candid, witty, and sings with a lot of soul, as expected.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I would say that this is more a 4 1/2 star cd, but its closer to 5 then 4. I loved Keane's first cd, but still have not purchased their second cd. When I listened to second one it just was not very good to me. Thier latest CD is extremley impressive and for $2.99 to download its worth every penny.
0765348276|5.0|\\"I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife's grave. Then I joined the army.\\"    With these intriguing lines, John Scalzi's spectacular journal of life in the Colonial Defense Force sweeps the reader helter-skelter into a reality-twisting journey that has few peers in the realm of alternative-future adventure stories.    It's never mentioned just how far in the future this story is set, but space is heavily colonized by then, and competition for suitable worlds between humans and the multitude of other intelligent species has created a need for large numbers of expendable soldiers. Things on earth are pretty much the same as now, however, and John Perry could be any of us, making the transformation he experiences feel almost like it could happen to you.    John becomes a soldier, young, strong, and a natural leader. He is recognized and promoted. During a pitched battle, he's rescued by a woman. A woman who looks exactly like his dead wife. Exactly. Her name is Jane Sagan and she's a member of the Special Forces, also known as the Ghost Brigade, a mysterious group of amazingly superior fighters said to have been cloned from dead persons.     Any more of a reveal would ruin the setup, so I'll curtail the story thread here. Let me just say, \\"Old Man's War\\" has many, many plot threads. It's as rich and original as anything I've read, and definitely not to be missed.     Art Tirrell is the author of \\"[[ASIN:1601640048 The Secret Ever Keeps]]  \\"simply put, the best underwater scenes I've ever read.\\" reviewer Meg W.
B00006JMQG|5.0|The print is outstanding, the Jazz score is amazing and the toning of the print is excellent.  This is also a 35mm print from Germany.  Everything is done right with this film.  I'm glad Kino took the time.  I've never seen Dr. Caligari look so good and sound so good.  Kino did an exemplary job.  If you haven't seen the film, you've got to, it's too good to not see at least once in your lifetime.  It should really be many times.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Everybody has a different Disney favorite but Pinoccio is surely mine. This is the stuff of childhood dreams (and nightmares also). Personally I think this is the one animated movie with the biggest heart of all. My only complaint: having to wait over 10 years of the DVD revolution before finally getting a decent edition, anyway, that will only make this release more of an event.
B000001ELF|5.0|Ace's 1978 solo album is a high! I've loved it since I first heard it back in 1981 and it has grown stronger since. I had a go at it yesterday just to find it as convincing as ever! God, the thrills of Ozone, Snow Blind, I'm In Need Of Love, Rip It Out, Fractured Mirror do it for me. He never overdoes it and his guitars are from some place else. ACE RULES! Plus his band - when there's one since he nearly played it all by himself apart from the drums - couldn't sound better. This is a lost gem of seventies' rock. If you haven't heard it or got it, you are definitely missing out. Just can't wait to listen to his new solo album since he's been saying he looked back on this album for inspiration. Long live THE ACE!!! And please let's forget about that other guy wearing his make-up. Nobody but Ace is worthy of it.
B00140PK6O|3.0|I bought this series because one of my favorite british actors Judy Dench was in the series. We all loved the \\" As Time goes By\\" so thought I would give this one a try. I would recommend this for those who enjoy movies of that time era.  I found it slow and not holding my interest, The reason being I'am not as interested in most films in the 18th century. Of course Gone with the Wind will always be a winner!
B0002KQNL8|2.0|On rare occasions sequels can be either fun, just as good as the original, or on even rarer instances, better than their predecessor. Unfortunately, this movie is neither of the three. I will admit I wasn't going into Return of the Living Dead 2 expecting the great fun I had with the first one, but was hoping for a decent zombie flick. Too bad I didn't get what I hoped for. Well, for starters, let's tackle the story. It seems to take place not too long after the first one but that's about it. What sets this apart mostly story wise from the first, is that there are no punks in the movie, but instead, it plays out almost like a typical kids flick from the eighties, such as \\"The Goonies\\", \\"E.T.\\", or \\"The Monster Squad\\"; which is weird because the movie is rated R. The acting isn't too bad, but the dialogue sucks. I understand most of it was supposed to be campy, which is fine by me, but instead it is too much and comes out poorly. Also, the characters are somewhat flat and aren't really likeable, unlike the first movie. In fact, the main kid in this movie annoyed the heck out of me. And some of the actors just seemed somewhat bored. Next there is the comedy, or lack thereof. While the first one was pretty funny, the jokes and gags in this one are bad and fall short of being remotely. After this we have the zombies, which are actually one of the few highlights of the film. For the most part they look great, except for the ridiculous hair pieces that most of them where. Also, there isn't a lot of gore in this compared to the first, which might disappoint some. One of my biggest complaints though is the soundtrack. I loved the first movie's soundtrack, which was cool and sometimes even catchy, because it actually added to the movie, but this one's just sucks. A lot of synthesizers are used and the occasional rock song played never matches to the punk tunes of the first. At least the poster art is good, though somewhat deceiving. If you've seen the first and want to see this, then just rent it.is, then just rent it.
0143038419|4.0|Eat, pray, love was one of my favorite books I read this summer.  It is a must- have beach read!  I suggest this book to anyone who wants to feel motivated to put themselves first and conquer their dreams!  The story begins with a woman who has everything she wants, or so people think.  It is about living up to society's expectations.  She has the perfect job, husband, home and is thinking about children.  However, something is missing.  Her marriage is unfulfilling and unlike her husband, she does not want children.  She does the unthinkable.  She leaves everything she created and worked for.  She left her job.  She left her husband.  She left her home.  It was the beginning of a nasty divorce, but she needed to do to grow as a person and be happy.  She had to start over, clear her mind, and live a free-spirited life that she had been missing all those years.  Basically, she needed to fill the void that had been lingering.    Along her journey, she meets a variety of people who impact her in one way or another.  She first goes to Rome to fulfill her need for the hearty Italian food.  She meets a man who teaches her Italian.  She then travels to India to submerse herself in spiritual healing.  Lastly, she travels to Bali where she attempts to fulfill her life with \\"balancing.\\"    This book is humorous, powerful, and a necessity for those soul searchers out there!  It will make you want to travel the world and live a life you have been missing!  Not to mention, Amazon delivered it promptly and in great shape.  I will continue to order from Amazon due to the efficiency and reliability of the product and service.
B00003CWPL|5.0|The idea that all of you \\"single star\\" raters, if thats what you can be called, are saying that this film has no artistic value or redeeming qualities is flatout ridiculous. You're all missing the point. Wether you saw the film earlier today, or twenty years  ago (as I've noted most of you have) you all seem to have something to say about it. What you don't realize is That that is the point, wether art makes you happy or upsets you, it's done it's job. The task real film artists set for themselves is AFFECTING people, good or bad, it doesn't matter. As long as the film makes you think or feel something then the film-maker has succeeded. It would be more upsetting if you saw it and had felt nothing and said nothing. Personally, I think that the fact that the film has made so many of you uncomfortable rather than leave you with the feeling of complacency that most modern films do would give Mr. Lynch an extreme sense of satisfaction. The effect of art is not the point, as long as it just HAS one, it remains art. I recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys stepping out of their element for ninety minutes or so, don't be afraid ! you're only in your living room ! for the rest of you, click the back button on your browser, I'm pretty sure I saw beautician and the beast on sale, that should leave you smiling and stupid.
B000063UR2|5.0|Never saw this when it came out years ago, bought the VHS originally to check out another Ridley Scott vehicle. For me, it does project a true fantasy \\"escape\\" world. Some incredible sets were made and dressed to create a version of a perfect natural world. Also some dark and forboding sets representing a hell of sorts. The story is sort of an Adam and Eve thing, with the parts played by the young cute people. I was eager to finally see the director's cut, with Jerry Goldsmith soundtrack. Sorry, but it didn't click with me. For some reason it took the experience away from a fantasy escape to a story more based in reality. Maybe the reason I have enjoyed this film over the years (the original) is that it reawakens the small eyes big in wonder boy inside of me. Cruise is young and unformed at this stage. Mia Sara makes a sweet princess, but when she gets dressed up in her \\"evil\\" black outfit, all I can say is YOWSA!. I say check it out.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|Perhaps this doesn't rank among my absolute favorites or what I consider \\"the greats\\" of sci-fi/fantasy, but it's up there as a movie I own and will watch several times. It's a fun fantasy - imagine being able to \\"jump\\" anywhere as the main character can from one place to the other in an instant! The main character, an immature, abused and damaged kid finds he can do this. Imagine all of the challenges that may occur and you've got this movie.<br /><br />It kept my attention and I was entertained. The character development and back stories could have been a bit more developed, but it was effective enough for me to care about what happens to Hayden Christensen's troubled character, and to enjoy the fantasy element. There was also enough action with some good special effects to keep my attention.<br /><br />Cutting to the chase, if you're a sci-fi or fantasy fan, you're going to want to see this. If you're a fan of Hayden Christensen or Samuel Jackson you'll absolutely want to see this.
B000S5ASM2|5.0|I've been enthralled with the works of Antonin Dvorak since I first heard his Slavonic Dances. Symphony No. 9 Represents his most famous work, inspired by American folk melodies. Most will find Op. 96 to be eerily familiar and think of it as being American in origin, but it's not. This work represents a series of sweeping, majestic melodies that range from serious as in Op. 95 to whimsical, as with Scherzo Capriccioso. This CD is a must for classical music lovers.
B0000648WZ|3.0|Now this might lose some weight with my review, but I feel I should first state that I have not read Heinlen's legendary novel yet.  Based on some other research I've done, it seems the movie does not accurately represent the novel.  I realize that often time's movies can butcher a great novel, just look at Battlefield Earth.  Absolutely terrible rendition and the movie wasn't that interesting overall.  On the other hand I enjoyed Starship Troopers in its own right.  While maybe not an exact replication of the novel, I think it did alright for a stand alone movie.<br /><br />I'm usually a sucker for Science Fiction films; I'll watch them even if they're terrible.  To me, Starship Troopers wasn't a terrible film; in fact I rather enjoyed it.  I can get into an action sci-fi movie centered on killing a bunch of alien bugs!  Whatever social satire Heinlen was initially attempting with his novel is virtually lost here, so all we have left to watch is a military action movie in a futuristic setting.  Alright, I'll buy into it; however, some parallels to other greater films can't help but be made.  I'm naturally talking about the movie Aliens, which I feel this movie was trying to really borrow a lot from.  We have everything you'd expect from that influence, hordes of alien creatures and the human infantry armed to the teeth shooting them.  Honestly, if you like that kind of a film concept you'll find this movie entertaining.  Granted it's not as high quality as Aliens, even though Starship Troopers came out years later, but most people will still have fun with it if you're not expecting the book.<br /><br />This story sort of centers around an infantry trooper named Rico and it tries to have more of a dramatic feel by delving into the background of how he joined the Mobile Infantry.  In some senses it tries to make some parts a bit sappy with his friends and this can come off a bit silly, but it's not too bad, I've definitely seen much worse in my day.  I think the world we're brought into is pretty interesting.  The government system is pretty interesting in the sense that you can't vote unless you're a citizen of the federation.  In order to become a citizen you have to spend time in service to the military.  It's kind of interesting, some countries have mandatory service for their citizens even today, but this is on a very extreme scale.  From there we get to see Rico go through boot camp all the way up to his first battle and all the other fighting he's sent through.  The first part of the film can feel a bit slow at times, but once he's on the battlefield things pick up pretty quickly!  Once the fighting actually started I was pretty locked in.  You shouldn't expect the greatest acting of all, after all this wasn't a huge scale production in terms of budget, but it's good for what it is.<br /><br />One of the main points in Starship Troopers is the bugs!  If you like creatures or monsters in any way then you'll find merit in this movie.  The bugs look really cool in my opinion and are particularly vicious!  One part that was neat about them was they moved with a bit of a purpose and the variant species of insects was really neat to see also.  They clearly move with a telepathic kind of ability between each other and this is obviously pulled right from the script of Aliens.<br /><br />Overall if you're up for a decent action packed science fiction film this is a pretty good watch.  Don't expect to get the highest quality script or acting here though, just expect lots of dead bugs and torn apart humans.  I thought it was just good enough to keep me entertained, but I wouldn't ever put this in my list of all time greatest films.  Enjoy it for what it is and you'll have some fun with it.  If you go in expecting high quality and something akin to the book, you'll likely be quite disappointed.into is pretty interesting.

B00005JPUN|1.0|The scariest moment in this film<br />is when our zero utters the statement<br />\\"I am a post-modern feminist\\".<br /><br />It was at that point that my finger went to<br />the stop button on the DVD remote.<br />I held out for a while,<br />hoping that there would be a reason for me<br />to continue to watch the film to its conclusion,<br />but finding none, I pulled the trigger.<br /><br />Don't tell me how it ends.<br />I don't care.<br /><br />The plot is a good one.<br />Space aliens, in this case,<br />microbial invaders, possessing human bodies<br />with their will and intelligence.<br />It has been done on film more than once<br />and well.<br /><br />The only reason for this film to exist<br />is as propaganda for space alien viruses<br />to convince them that it is alright to possess<br />human beings because they are just space trash<br />stuck to the planet earth due to gravity.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the image of<br />normal family life being a result<br />of possession by alien invaders.<br /><br />Flush this one down the toilet<br />and check out either version of<br />\\"Invasion Of The Body Snatchers\\".

I appreciate the simplicity of this book as well, which makes for a very elegant and useful collection of jazz standards.  I would not settle for one of the newer collections of jazz standards such as \\"the New Real Book,\\" which is clearly named to trick musicians who are looking for this book.

B001E75QGG|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I was sort of in shock. I didn't quite know what to make of it since it was the first Indy movie in 19 years, and it feels the most different from the other Indy films.<br /><br />However, the more I watch this movie (I saw it twice in the theater and three times on blu-ray), the more it grows on me and feels like an Indiana Jones film. It was just difficult at first, being that I grew up on the other ones and this one came out 19 years after \\"Last Crusade.\\" It takes place in a different era, with different enemies, and is inspired by a different genre of films. So automatically it'll feel off. Indy is no longer in the 1930s republic serial/nazi war era. He's in the 1950s UFO craze/cold war era.<br /><br />Sure, the \\"nuke the fridge\\" scene was a little too much, even for an Indy movie (all the movies have outrageous stunts in them, especially \\"Temple of Doom\\"), but I can overlook that because the rest of the movie, despite some poor editing choices and minor faulty logic in some areas, really succeeds in the entertainment realm, and really feels like an Indiana Jones film. And really, that's what it's all about, right? These are movies you are supposed to feel more and think less. That's the way they've always been. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />For those of you who hate this film, just give this movie time to grow on you with multiple viewings. Quit over-analyzing and just have fun. Just try to imagine you're 10 years old again and remember what it's like to watch a movie like this at that age. I'm not implying you have to be 10 years old to enjoy this movie, but I do think Indy films are meant to bring out the 10 year-old in all of us.<br /><br />\\"Temple of Doom\\" had the same sort of reception when it first came out. Think about it. \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" the best of the series and highly regarded as a perfect movie by most came out, and then three years later came \\"Temple.\\" That movie is nowhere near the quality of \\"Raiders.\\" People were legitimately ticked off at \\"Temple of Doom.\\" It was so different in tone, was way over the top and the story was just so-so compared to \\"Raiders.\\" Now, since \\"Temple of Doom\\" has had two decades to grow on people, it is more readily accepted now. Even if people still don't think it's as good as Raiders, people love that movie now. That, and many have grown up with it now. \\"Crystal Skull\\" is the same thing. Nowhere near the quality of \\"Raiders\\" or even \\"Last Crusade,\\" but it may be as good, if not better than \\"Temple.\\" It just needs time to grow with us. Right now, it's new and disconnected from the others.<br /><br />Oh, and the Blu-ray two-disc set is definitely worth buying (if you have a Blu-ray player and HDTV, of course). The picture is in true HD quality and makes the movie look breathtaking. The sound is awesome and all the special features are very insightful and fun.

They did a decent job with all the documentaries.    In the end, I love this movie and I love it on Blu-ray. Buy it today if you're an Indy fan!
1416562591|5.0|The Booker Prize winning White Tiger is a 270 page anti-India screed. It's lovely. It reminds me very much of an extended Thomas Bernhard rant, though there is way more action here than in a Bernhard book. Indian politics, corruption, caste system, and the heinousness of village life all get vigorously rubbed in your face. I read the whole book in a single afternoon. Just wouldn't stop and put it down to go outside. You gotta check it out.
1572816112|5.0|It's been a long time since a really great deck has come along but it's worth the wait for Patrick Valenza's, \\"Deviant Moon\\" .   By that, I mean one that isn't just gimmicky like so many in the past 10 years But a deck that is so well thought out and  beautifully laid out as well.  It walks skillfully between the most difficult of lines: that of tradition and transition, while still remaining balanced.   Having read Tarot for many years now, It is quite easy as well as delightful to  do readings with this deck. Destined not only to become a collector's item but a treasure to have and to pass down to future generations.  High marks all around and a big note of thanks for all of Mr. Valenza's efforts in putting this together.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|A veteran double crossed by the government during his early military career is used once again in this fast paced action flick.  The unsuspecting soldier is talked into helping 'prevent' the assassination of a president, but things are not what they seem and he's roped into a deep conspiracy. Now he must run for his life while he tries to find a way to reveal the truth. I could slightly guess the formula and where it was leading on this one, but still enjoyed the action packed story.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

So here's my list of problems with the plot:    How a cure for cancer became an airborne virus is not explained.    Why is Neville immune? He must know because he is making the anti-virus.    The zombie/vampire creatures are made out to be exceptionally stupid, but for stupid creatures they show some great signs of intelligence towards the end. Like:  laying a trap for Neville, which he falls for and ends up hanging from a rope.  climbing a lamppost in order to flatten his car.    Samatha's death - why did he not inject Sam with the cure that he knew worked on a rat, and ultimately worked on humans?    The woman and her son - they just appear out of nowhere with little explanation of how they survived the chaos. They bring a message to the movie that I have not seen revealed .. which is 'Human's screwed up and nearly wiped out their species, but god is finding a way to help the human race survive. She is a messenger from god, how else could she have found a human colony in Vermont?    Finally, the colony walls - what's the stop the creatures from scaling them?    Les.

B001HDYK6Y|4.0|Did you enjoy many 80's alt bands? If so, you may appreciate the blend of those sounds with Keane's own. If not, you may find yourself disappointed.     It's useless to say, \\"Why doesn't Keane sound like they did on Hopes and Fears?\\" because bands are damned if they do and damned if they don't -- if they sound the same, they get criticized for not \\"progressing\\" in their work, and if they sound different, they get criticized for not sounding the same.    Personally, I prefer that Keane take some risks, as they clearly have done over the last two albums. Love it or hate it, at least they are showing that they aren't a one-note band.     My advice? Try listening to this album several times before you pass judgement... you may be surprised to find yourself humming some tunes you initially thought were awful or boring.
B000002KDG|4.0|Coming off of the harrowing power of their lamenting \\"Tonight's The Night\\", Neil Young and Crazy Horse later proved their tenacity with this clever concept album. It's interesting how the spirit of rock and roll can be captured by merely turning up the distortion for each consecutive track, until the first song is practically remade with a scratchy, loud, and almost total revision. The tracks in the middle, unfortunately, seem like filler for this concept and not much else. But the message of \\"Rock and Roll Will Never Die\\" is made clearer with each turn of the effects dial, and the result is almost scary.
1416594884|3.0|I think I desperately started counting the pages of this book by the time I had reached page 60-something. There were, however, some 267 more to conquer.<br /><br />The storyline sounded so intriguing at first: A young Muslim with a secretive past surfaces in Hamburg, Germany, and soon finds himself in the crosshairs of various secret service organizations. Add to that his idealistic female German lawyer, and a private banker whose bank for decades had stashed away the blood money the young Muslim Issa has come to lay claim on - this sounded like a good thriller and something I was looking forward to reading.<br /><br />But somehow this story never got off the ground for me. I am a bit unsure as to why. It might have been that nothing really happened in terms of action - which to me is an essential ingredient of any thriller. And by action I don't necessarily mean gun battles, violence, etc. Just twists and turns to move the story along. The book's ending was the one exception. But since the entire book was pretty much void of anything but talking and thinking, this fast-paced ending almost felt disconnected from the rest of the story, as if it had nothing to do with all of the previous 325 pages.<br /><br />Another factor was that the way the protagonists used direct speech sounded way too ceremonial to me to be believable. Time and again it kept me removed from the story to a point where I simply didn't care about any of them. It might be that this is because Le Carre is British but it just never convinced me or ignited my interest.<br /><br />And lastly, the story itself remained sketchy throughout, with too little detail and background information to be interesting or credible.<br /><br />I almost feel that Le Carre wanted to write literature, a book that had something profound to say about the choices we make, the moral implications that come with it, etc. But it was too little of this, and at the same time also too little of the other - the thriller genre.<br /><br />All in all, this book left me feeling quite dissatisfied. 2.5 stars if that choice were available.g quite dissatisfied. 2.5 stars if that choice were available.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I'm no KOL expert, but I enjoy all kinds of music. Leaning to the rock side of sound. Have sampled other KOL on Amazon but this CD knocks my socks off. KOL is 1 band that has relit my musical flame. The voice, the sound, the blend of tracks. Haven't listened to an album (old school) CD over and over since Springsteens \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\". Do yourself a favor and pick this 1 up !!!
B000J10EQU|3.0|This only just merits 3 stars. It really is far too long, and loses a star for that. It loses another star for the frequent and painfully obvious use of CGI and if I was being unkind it would lose more for its over sentimental and sugary styling. How much music with heavenily choirs and strings are we expected to take?<br /><br />I wasn't especially impressed by Brandon Routh, who was clearly copying the Christopher Reeve formula but he was wooden by comparison. The best by far was Kevin Spacey, but he wasn't given a lot to do. The films I've seen that have been directed by Bryan Singer have in general been very good, for me this is his first failure.<br /><br />By all means buy it, if you can get it very cheap, but its not worth spending much on!
0345495004|5.0|Great book! You just have to read it. The ending is so unexpected that it shocks you. I guess my biggest surpise (besides the ending) was the time that it took place.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This may well have been the most beautifully written book that I've read in years.  The story is compelling and the narrative is absolutely exquisite.

B001E95ZNI|4.0|Ed Harris' \\"Appaloosa\\" is based on a Western by Robert P. Parker, who is best known for his Spenser detective novels. You could argue that Westerns, nearly all of which have outlaws as important characters, have always had an aspect of flim noir. But \\"Appaloosa\\" makes the connection plainer than usual, especially in its ending.<br /><br />Itinerant lawmen Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) arrive in the town of Appaloosa, N.M., hired by the city fathers to end the reign of terror instigated by the suavely murderous rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons). Cole and Hitch, so tough they make boot leather look like marshmallow cream, manage to capture Bragg, but they get sidetracked by the arrival in town of winsome widow Allison French (Renee Zellweger). Cole and Allie are soon an item, but Allie--shall we say--doesn't want to make that exclusive. As Hitch says to Cole, \\"She wants to ride with the head stallion.\\" \\"There's only one of those,\\" Cole replies. \\"Yeah--at a time,\\" Hitch says.<br /><br />Harris tells the story a bit too leisurely at times, but he keeps our interest with some neat plot twists, opulent photography by Dean Semler, and an ending that is a fascinating variation on the principle of \\"Greater Love Hath No Man.\\" The performances of Harris and Mortensen can reasonably be described as perfect, and Zellweger does a reasonable job of creating sympathy for a Wild West variation on the femme fatale. Irons, unfortunately, never projects quite the right kind of menace as Bragg--he exudes malevolence, but never seems quite tough enough to be a match for Cole and Hitch. Among the supporting performers, I particularly liked Timothy Spall as the lily-livered mayor of Appaloosa; Ariadna Gil as a level-headed hooker who is Hitch's confidante; and Gabriel Marantz as a stalwart young cowboy who testifies against Bragg.

B001EN71CW|5.0|i predorered this set after hearing that it was going to be released. really loved the show and hated the fact that the dvds were only stereo. but a $90 msrp seemed a little steep, luckly amazon nocked $30 off to make the price around 60 wich is more reasonable. really liked how fox tries to justify the high price tag dangling  the 5.1 DTS-HD master carrot, and the 1080 mpeg-2. but they could have remastered the special features to something a little higher than 480i if they took out the(not to be offencife or anything) other languages(honestly i dont see why german got dts treatment when spanish and french only got dolby). basically theres the same special features as the dvd but there are some hd extras:  * Audio commentary by executive producer Joss Whedon and actors Nathan Fillion, Alan Tudyk and Ron Glass (\\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\")  * Featurette: \\"'Firefly' Reunion: Lunch with Joss, Nathan, Alan and Ron  but to be honest i hope fox really worked on this and not gave the same menus as on the dvd. would be nice if they included serenity in ths set as well(would make most people think the price is a bargan) but i think universal has the rights to it. also i hope they actually took the time to properly master the hd audio and not just reencode it like other shows have done in the past ending up with the same quality sound just louder/at a higher bitrate.

B001DHXT2A|4.0|I appear to be one of about six people who actually liked Ang Lee's movie Hulk. This puts in me in good company with Roger Ebert, but that's about it. And that's too bad, cause it was a good movie, it just wasn't what people wanted in a film about the Hulk. Having watched The Incredible Hulk, I know now what people wanted. What they wanted, simply, was \\"HULK SMASH!\\" Boy, do you ever get that in this movie, which reboots the Hulk franchise.    Edward Norton turns in a memorable performance as Bruce Banner, tortured scientist who must remain calm as possible under any circumstances (he can't even have sex anymore cause it excites his body too much). He's being hunted down by General Ross, and has a love affair with Ross' daughter, Betty. He's trying to find a cure, living a solitary life, dodging the authorities, etc, etc. Really, it doesn't matter. The plot is entirely tacked-on and doesn't do much but serve as links between scenes where the Hulk gets to pop up.    That the movie succeeds despite this is saying something. As I said, it isn't much more than scenes of pointless plot followed by lotsa action, but that action is damn impressive! It's amazing how much the effects have improved just since the first Hulk movie came out. Some people compared the original Hulk's look to Shrek, or animated lime Jell-o. He, and the Abomination, both look very impressive and reasonably convincing.    But I have to say, much as I liked this movie, it wasn't nearly as deep or, frankly, good, as Iron Man. That point really gets driven home as you're constantly reminded of that better movie, as the military types use weapons from Stark Industries and Tony Stark himself puts in an appearance at the end of the movie. SHIELD gets their name dropped a lot, too. That does at least lend a sense of continuity with the previous film, as do references to the super soldier serum that turned Steve Rogers into Captain America.    You also get a bit of a feeling of deja vu if, like me, you watched the old Hulk TV series back in the day. Not only doe Lou Ferigno do a cameo appearance in person, but he also voices the Hulk. Bill Bixby even turns up in a brief little cameo. Best of all, they use what Family Guy described as \\"The sad walking-away music\\" on the soundtrak. Very cool.    Do I recommend this movie? Yes, but I strongly recommend seeing it on the big screen, since I think on TV it won't look nearly as impressive. Plus since there's apparently plans for movies with Thor, Captain America and Nick Fury, culminating in a film about the Avengers, it's worth seeing this movie so you'll have a better idea how it will link together with those.    Even just as a stand-alone film, it is pretty damn entertaining and lots of fun. Great mindless escapism. The movie succeeds at what it sets out to do, and in this case, that's good enough for me!
B0002TKFRM|4.0|I love this record.  I've always loved \\"Pictures\\" but never owned a copy.  When I found it was available on SACD, I had to get it since it's the best consumer distribution format I've ever heard.  The recording was great in its day and still holds well over many more \\"technologically advanced\\" recordings.  Really, the most of the best classical recordings are done with 2 or 3 microphones and a stereo or 3-track tape recorder.  My one peve with this album is that they used some pretty heavy digital noise reduction which saps some of the life out of the string section.  The horns are still clean and clear though and the percussion is as it should be.  The recording really didn't need much (if any) noise reduction really as it was so clean in the first place but for some reason the engineers felt obligated to push down the noise even further.  In light of that, I can see why people try to get the original LPs whenever possible.  But it's still a great performance with lots of realism (like musician's breath or turning pages) reminding you there's people making this music.  Many new recordings are artificially forced to be so steryl and clean they sound fake.  This sounds like an orchestra in my room.  A worthy buy for any SACD enthusiast.
B000077VPU|2.0|I was so excited to finally be finding this on DVD, but like so many others, I am extremely disappointed in that not only were all of the opening acts and footage of Freddie's performances cut out, also Elizabeth Taylor's appearance was cut out!  She was one of the main people behind putting this concert together not only for the sake of raising money for AIDS Research, but also in honor of \\"Queen\\" and Freddie.  Cutting this out was in extremely poor taste!  I am so glad I still have my video and that it still works well, but this DVD needs to be re-released with all of the proper footage that is suppose to be on this recording!
B00007K02F|1.0|I'm a huge Jane Eyre fan (both written and film/TV) so I was very excited to see this version. William Hurt is a terrific actor and I've enjoyed his other work, so I looked forward to his portrayal of Rochester.     I enjoyed the adaptation until halfway into the movie. Then everything went horribly wrong - Jane leaves right after the failed wedding to go to Gateshead? The Rivers family (minus one sister, I forget if it's Diana or Mary) live at Gateshead? She met St. John when her Aunt Reed died? Why take huge liberties with the storyline that are completely untrue to the story? I'm not a Jane Eyre purist, but the William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg version was just as awful as the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version.     Bottom line:     1) If you've never read Jane Eyre, I would NOT recommend seeing this version before you read the book. Actually I wouldn't recommend this version on any level.     2) If you've never seen a film/TV adaptation of Jane Eyre, I'd recommend starting with the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version first and move on to the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version afterward. The TD/ZC version is 6 hours and does a fantastic job of keeping the integrity of the novel in tact. The TS/RW is 4 hours, takes a few liberties with the novel, but the two leads' performances are absolutely electric and this version is very well done. Enjoy!
1593080255|3.0|Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a thought-provoking novel that vacillates between ambling, seemingly directionless conversation and a riveting narrative thread that eventually bubbles up to the surface with the intensity of a volcanic eruption. The Picture of Dorian Gray, though not much more than a century old, has already been deemed a \\"classic\\" by literature-lovers, and after reading the book, I can understand its status. Wilde's command of the English language is almost unparalleled in recent literature.<br /><br />Warning - Spoilers Follow<br /><br />Here's the gist of the book. Dorian Gray is a young man whose physical appearance is handsome and innocent. An aspiring artist paints a beautiful portrait of Dorian. Dorian wishes that he always look like his youthful appearance in the portrait. The wish comes true. Dorian remains the same - youthful and charming, but the portrait begins to transform itself into the image of his soul.<br /><br />When Dorian embraces a life of hedonism, he uses his good looks and charm to obtain whatever he desires in life. His insensitivity drives a friend to suicide. The evil desires of his heart eventually cause him to murder a friend in cold blood. Over a period of twenty years, Dorian becomes a monster on the inside (reflected by the portrait of his soul) even as he remains youthful and innocent on the outside.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde's homosexuality is no secret, and the reader can easily discern certain homosexual overtones in the book (especially at the beginning). Perhaps Wilde's subtle innuendoes of homosexuality have made his works so appealing to lovers of literature who tend to sympathize and approve of homosexual behavior.<br /><br />Upon reading Dorian Gray, however, I could not help but notice how the lifestyle of hedonism is so implicitly condemned by the narrative's outcome. If Dorian's hedonism includes sexual relationships with men as well as with women (and Wilde does hint at this), then homosexuality comes under the same umbrella as the rest of Dorian's sinful passions. One can hardly characterize The Picture of Dorian Gray as a pro-homosexual book.<br /><br />Readers of this blog will find the picture of depravity in Dorian Gray to be intriguing. Throughout the story, Dorian, even in his hedonism, acts in a manner that forces the reader to desire justice and redemption. The book's end emphasizes the need for punishment and retribution - pointing at death as the wages of sin.<br /><br />What does the life of unbridled hedonism look like? What does it do to the soul? What happens to the human being who seeks to fulfill his every passion and desire? How does sin affect us physically? Do we age because we sin? These and more are the questions that Oscar Wilde raises in The Picture of Dorian Gray.st of Dorian's sinful passions.

B000784WMW|5.0|I re-watched this version of Jane Eyre and fell in love with it all over again.    I agree with what the majority of reviews written have said over and over - Dalton IS Rochester - brooding, powerful, and emotionally-charged.

Curl up on the couch on your day off with this version and you'll have 6 delicious hours of Jane Eyre goodness to enjoy.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson are my favorite Rochester/Jane pairing ever. The chemistry between she and Rochester was amazing. While some liberties were taken with the story and dialogue, I can't say enough good about this version.     Some reviews complain that Toby Stephens wasn't an \\"ugly\\" enough Rochester, but I think he was absolutely perfect for the part. Stephens brought a level of sex appeal to Rochester that Timothy Dalton couldn't equal.     Ruth Wilson is my favorite Jane casting so far - she brought warmth, quiet intelligence, and humor to the role.     The ending was too Hollywood and sappy, but otherwise, this version is well worth your time.
B0002XNSY0|3.0|This comedy is about the dangers of our nuclear age. Doctor Strangelove is a spoof about the insanity produced by those who concentrate in seeking power, for power corrupts and absolute power has a tendency to corrupt absolutely.    General Jack D. Ripper, played by Sterling Hayden, is after purity of bodily fluids and wants to rid the world of Communism, therefore he orders a squadron of bombers to penetrate Russian soil and eliminate key places to destroy this enemy of the free world.    The President of the United States, played by Peter Sellers, who by the way, plays several roles during this film, from the war room, gets involved in negotiations for peace, and the give and take is simply... hilarious. Simply love when he says: \\"you can't fight in the war room, that behavior is unacceptable in the war room.\\" Peter Sellers is also the British soldier who attempts to prevent the bombing of Russia, and the bomb-maker, the... Strange-love Doctor.    We realize that the movie must have been seen as a daring move during its release, but today, we have gone beyond the fear of making the bomb, to the realization that at anytime... we are in danger of taking weapons to the point of self-destruction.    An interesting film.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Musing on Coldplay<br /><br />There are those who will never like this band. For instance, from Drowned in Sound, \\"They try hard, Coldplay, but it just isn't enough; their fourth album might just be their best yet, but it's still a long way from being the epochal classic that Chris Martin is desperate to create.\\"  Metacritic ([...]) assigns a \\"score\\" of 60 to this review. From Tiny Mix Tapes we have the following: \\"Don't get me wrong, this is the groups strongest offering\\". The assigned score? A 50! I have strong reservations about reviewers who obviously dislike a band and who will never like the band but who feel that their opinion is of value. I see these individuals as doing nothing more than preaching to the converted. It is rather like someone who despises soccer writing an assessment of Euro 2008 for a disinterested audience. If I want an opinion on an artist's latest offering, perhaps because I am considering a purchase, I want an open-minded opinion by someone who is at least prepared to be receptive to the work of the artist.<br /><br />Those who dislike the band are prone to lamenting the lack of any real substance. The reviewer of A Rush... in The Austin Chronicle began his review with these words: \\"Musically, Coldplay are comfort food: easily digestible, not at all spicy (but not necessarily bland), probably a little fattening. The macaroni and cheese of rock bands\\". And he liked the cd! Admittedly, Coldplay's lyrics do not carry the weight of, say, early Bob Dylan of Billy Bragg. Then again, who suggested that the band was attempting to create anything more than dreamy and atmospheric songs of love and heartbreak? One of the music critic's favourite tricks is to suggest that an artist has failed in his efforts to create something that was never intended by the artist in the first place! A more honest approach would be for the critic to lay his cards on the table at the beginning of the review. We, the readers, would then be in a position to critique the critic properly!<br /><br />Another common criticism from detractors is that Coldplay is \\"bland\\". With respect I would suggest that this negative observation, too, is mis-guided. There is certainly an hypnotic quality to the much of the music. It is moody and contemplative. It is not music for all occasions. It is undeniably not suitable for a pool party on a steamy August afternoon or a raucous keg party on a Saturday night. It is, however, ideal for a quiet and rainy afternoon or a romantic evening, a bottle of wine and a roaring fireplace.<br /><br />Each of Coldplay's previous releases benefitted from repeated spins. Viva La Vida is no different. In wine terms it is more akin to Bordeaux than it is to California Cab. It is subtle rather than obvious. At first glance there would appear to no song or songs that leap out as singles or heavy rotation material. However, after a few listens over the weeks since its release several cuts emerged to me as standouts.<br /><br />Is Coldplay's music \\"Pretty, lovely, fine, fair, comely, pleasant, agreeable, acceptable, adequate, satisfactory, nice, benign, harmless, innocuous, innocent, largely unobjectionable, safe, forgettable\\" as suggested in Pitchfork's review of the debut cd or is it \\"tastefully crafted, tuneful, and affecting\\" as described in Y Music's review of the follow up?

My biggest qualm with this series not ending in 3 books, is that this book was verbose with very little action.<br /><br />Eragon's 4 actions:<br />1) Killed the Razac- this took about 60 pages<br />2) Visit Tronjiheim to hurry the dwarves in picking their king<br />3) Went to Ellesmera (for a 2 day conversation)<br />4) Flew to Feinster for a battle<br /><br />Actions 3 and 4 occurred in the last 150 pages, and because Eragon agreed to support Orik, he spent most of action 2 wandering around the tunnels, gettng attacked once, and moaning about missing Saphira.  The rest of the text usually involved a lot of transit...Eragon running (whoohoo), Eragon and Saphira flying against strong headwinds, and flying in good weather.  Perhaps Paolini thinks this transit time is important and interesting due to the long travel sequences in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, but first, that was a series about a journey...therefore travel is necessary, this series is about war more than anything else, and second, Tolkien was a much much more gifted writer than Paolini.<br /><br />Also, Paolini stated in is excuse for not finishing the series in 3 books, that this gave him an opportunity to explore the characters.  However, Eragon's incessant moaning over the ethics of killing and the difference in his morals from those of elves, isn't what I would call an interesting expose into the minds of Eragon and the other characters. In fact, it only leads the reader to realize that Eragon is indeed a whiny child, given far too much authority because a dragon hatched to him...but that more than anything, the author expects us to believe Eragon to be an upstanding ethical person who we should all exalt as the best person to lead because he fears it.<br /><br />I have always found Paolini's writing pretentious, but it seems to have only gotten worse with his success.  The only reason for the success of his series is the more than fortunate timing of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films and \\"Harry Potter\\" series generating a boom in interest in fantasy...however this series cannot compare to either of those.  Tolkien and \\"Harry Potter\\" fans will find The Inheritance Cycle superficial, unimaginitive, poorly written, and lacking in action.<br /><br />The similarities, such as 3 young unknowing people thrown into the wars of previous generations, are not enough to make the Inheritance Cycle a satisfying read...which is only more frustrating because it doesn't end when it is supposed to- and unlike the other LOTR and HP series'- you very much want this one to end.worse with his success.

0525478183|5.0|Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer<br />on 09/20/2008<br /><br />Margo Roth Spiegelman is a name you say in one breath. Just ask Quentin. Q has watched her grow up, the literal girl next door. When she shows up at his window late one night, he's swept through the next few hours on an adventure such as he's never experienced. Still in the thrall of overnight hijinks, he goes to school to learn that Margo has disappeared.<br /><br />With his friends Ben and Radar, Q desperately works to solve the mystery that is Margo Roth Spiegelman. Her cryptic trail of clues has Q crisscrossing central Florida. His friends say she'll show up at graduation, but he's not so sure. He doesn't care about prom or graduation. He just wants to find Margo before it's too late.<br /><br />Author John Green knows how to see into the souls of teens on the cusp of adulthood. There is a lot of Young Adult fiction that sees teens just as kids who need to be entertained. Green sees beyond the surface and creates situations that delve into readers hearts--whether they are eighteen years old or thirty or fifty.<br /><br />Green waxes philosophical fairly often, but it works. There is enough \\"normal\\" teen behavior to balance the spurts of deep thinking. Besides the intellect behind the book, Green does a great job of setting each scene. Readers will find each of their senses engaged, pulling them into Q's life.<br /><br />Lest readers think I'm all aglow about PAPER TOWNS, it is worth noting that there is a lot of swearing and frequent references to sex and teen drinking. This novel could be used as one of those \\"teaching moments\\" professionals like to talk about. Quite frankly, a lot of the behavior in this book is common, so it would be a good chance to talk about it and let kids and parents air out how they feel about these issues, as well as the overall plot of the book.<br /><br />This is one that will make people see others around them with fresh eyes. I highly recommend this novel for older teens and up.<br /><br />4.5 Books
B0017ASV1C|3.0|The situation in that film is too classical to be original. It is humdrum and it is not the trick of making us believe one of the two cops is the culprit whereas we discover at the end it is the other that is going to renew in anyway the genre and the interest of the film. Two aging actors reduced to their life-long tricks made easy by new technology. And it is not an allusion to the dirty cop of Clint Eastwood that is going to renew in any way the discourse and provide it with legitimacy. And finally it is not the cheating of the police institution that is going to present the final death of the \\"justice-maker\\" at the end and the bullets of his own team-mate as the fatal success of the dead officer to stop the crimes of the criminal he was, hence making the myth of that criminal true though it will have no body, no identity, no nothing that is changing the plot from mud to gold. We should have expected that flop with the title because there is absolutely no righteous kill because \\"Thou shalt not kill\\". It reveals nothing about cops, the police, law and order or anything else. It is just some kind of paycheck to two aging actors.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
0802130208|4.0|Ignatius J. Reilly is quite an interesting character. At times, I wanted him to succeed so badly that when he finally mucks things up, I wanted to ring his neck. It's just this kind of love-hate connection to the character that made this book so funny and such a quick page-turner. The author also gets New Orleans just right, from the locations to the accents of the various characters. The dialogue is never boring, trite or hokey, it flows well and even makes the odd and dissonant Ignatius read as a flesh and blood person and not a fictional hodge-podge of opinions. A great pleasure, highly recommended...
0307455874|5.0|Barack Obama is an amazing writer.  While many might expect this book about politics to be dull, it is actually extremely interesting and entertaining.  The ideas that Obama presents shows his excellent grasp of the issues that America is currently dealing with, and proves that he is prepared to take on the role of President.  A must read for all Americans.
B00005JPS8|5.0|This was a must have after watching this at the theatre. Iron Man had all the qualities that made it an excellent movie great acting, effects, directing etc. Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Sparks from his look to his attitude and when Iron Man shows up wow. If any Marvel movie should be bought its this.
B000J103WK|5.0|The DVD helped bring back some wonderful sounds that I grew up with. I would highly recommend it to all those who love their music and presence of stage.....and to anyone else who appreciates great music.
B001DDBCUU|3.0|This one goes on the new list I am compling where I get through about an hour of a movie where I am watcihng it simply to wait for something to happen and then I fall asleep and wake up and the MOVIE IS STILL ON...and then i fall back asleep and wake up and its STILL on and nothing happened YET. I was only a mild SATC fan when it was on TV and maybe that is why I found this to be a horrible movie. In my opinion, they should have left well enough alone at the end of the series.
0575081406|5.0|One of the best books I've read in.. a long time.     \\"The Name of the Wind\\" has instantly shot up to near the top of my list. I could name its peers on one hand, and have fingers left over.
0307269752|4.0|I thought this book was great for 2 reasons: the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Harriet and the description of Sweden. This was the first time I read anything about Sweden and I liked reading about the country. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because I wasn't a huge fan of the Wennerstrom story line. The financial corruption and libel case just didn't hold my interest as much as the Vanger storyline. However, it's still a great book and I read it in only 2 days. It kept me intrigued.
B000001DQI|5.0|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - 1973  (*****)  17 tracks  (76:23)<br /><br />Many people consider this Elton John's masterpiece album. It is very good, and has many excellent and classic songs on it. Sonically, it sounds great, and as the number of reviews indicates, this is Elton John's most popular album. It easily has more than double the average number of reviews of his other 70's era albums. Back in the day this was a double vinyl album of 17 tracks, and there are only two weak songs on the whole thing. But, because of that, it end's up #2 on my classic era 1970's Elton John list, just behind the excellent Tumbleweed Connection (which has no weak songs).<br /><br />Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is one of the most classic rock albums of the 1970's, and is an album everyone needs to own because it is packed with great music. This was one of the first Elton John albums I was exposed to after previously only owning his greatest hits album. Boy, was I ever impressed the first time I heard the opening track Funeral for a Friend / Love Lies Bleeding, with it's slow atmospheric beginning to it's hard rockin' and fast paced mid-section. This song is just awesome and really sets the bar high for the rest of the album to try and match. There are so many great songs on this that hardly if ever got any radio airplay. From \\"I've Seen that Movie Too\\" to \\"All the Young Girls Love Alice\\". It doesn't matter if you are an Elton John fan or not, every fan of classic rock and quality music from the `70's needs to have this one. It's an absolute 5 star album.<br /><br />**** Highly Recommended ****
0140067477|5.0|This elegant and well-written volume by Benjamin Hoff, along with its sequel âaeThe Te of Pigletâ, is perhaps one of the finest pieces of writing about Taoism in the West.  Having just read and enjoyed the original Pooh stories by A.A. Milne, I became intrigued by this book and obtained it.  As soon as I opened it I could not find a good point to lay it down.  I kept reading and reading until I finished it in a single day.  The book was so pleasurable, so well-written, and so intriguing.  I kept thinking and imagining all the different concepts of Taoism that this book introduces me to.  âaeWu Weiâ or effortless action; living in harmony with nature; Nowhere and Nothing; the importance of the present; the extreme alienation we in the West create for ourselves by being constantly busy.  These are all important issues that relate to my life personally, and I feel I have gained something from reading this book, in addition to spending an enjoyable time reading it.<br /><br />Those who didnâ(tm)t like this book for some reason are missing the point.  The âaeTao of Poohâ was never meant to be the definite treatise on Taoism, or the dispassionate comparison of East and West.  As a matter of fact, this book is classified under âaeHumorâ.  In fact, it is this humor of pooh which lends itself so aptly to introducing Taoism.  Since reading this book, I became interested in reading the other book by John Tyerman Williams called âaePooh & the Philosophersâ.  What a disaster that turned out to be!  See, the defining character of Pooh is that he never really takes himself seriously, which is perfectly in line with the attitude of major Taoist philosophers.  Yet Western philosophy thinks of itself as a serious subject, an attitude that is quite un-Pooh-ish, so I donâ(tm)t know what on earth Williams was thinking in using Pooh to illustrate Western philosophy.  Anyways, donâ(tm)t buy Williamâ(tm)s book, buy this!  If you like Pooh and feel intrigued with Eastern Philosophy, you will find a pleasurable reading  in this masterpiece that was the first to recognize this beautiful match.ou will find a pleasurable reading  in this masterpiece that was the first to recognize this beautiful match.
076535618X|3.0|Not too bad to read on a plane - which is where I read it - but definitely not as good a read as the two Scalzi books  that preceded it.  Too much talking, not enough action, and a less compelling story line.
B000VDBD6Q|5.0|I read the Adventures and the Memoirs when I was a kid and enjoyed them thoroughly.  Here are the complete collection.  I don't give it full marks because sometimes the opening pattern gets repetitive and uninteresting.  In two short stories Doyle used the exact same opening (The Cardboard Box and The Resident Patient).  Also at some point in the latter half of the book the stories become almost predictable from the beginning.  The novels are much more interesting and exciting.  I think the Hound of the Baskervilles is the best, followed closely by the Sign of Four and then a Study in Scarlet.
B00003CXGG|2.0|I purchased this movie only because I'm an admirer of Jet Li's ability to incorporate his martial arts skills into any genre of movie. There were some comical points in the movie but overall the plot was weak.
