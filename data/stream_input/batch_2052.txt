B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best upgrade ever!! the graphics are way better in 3D,  there are different obsticles, more upgrades, this is just the best :)
B0043ZDFEQ|3.0|some good songs on this album as well. I purchased this after purchasing his newer album, and found a few songs I had liked previously and didn't know were his. So I bought this one as well.
B000FC1MOQ|3.0|I thought it was a good book but seemed very exaggerated. The ending was heart breaking and happy at the same time.
B007NYPWS6|5.0|zany but sad.  Jody Foster takes the cake.  Two couples descend from polite superficial agreeableness to total lunacy over the course of a few hours in their Brooklyn home.  Unbelievably funny.
0307592731|5.0|I LOVED this book, and had the delightful and unusual experience of traveling California/Oregon while reading, so was able to identify several entries onto the trail itself. Entered Ashland just after finishing the book, and raved about it to a friend who happened to be at a Grateful Dead concert in Ashland the very weekend Cheryl arrived. Other than odd coincidences, the book struck me as an honest and humble account of a woman accomplishing a remarkable feat. Thank you for your courage, Cheryl. Walk on!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was good. only took 2 days to complete but still a really fun game. Definatly a game I would recommend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone if you like reading or not! It's a great story! I will definitely read this over and over!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|okay I love this game it's perfect for little kids and entertains my sister and she loves it it is her favorite game
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Didn't like the prison scene or the mutilation by the psychopaths but the meat of the story was excellent. Child is a good writer who weaves an intriguing tale. I hope in future books he leaves the gross stuff behind and focuses more on the plot versus the gory details. I recommend this author but warn you that some stuff is hard to get through.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is finally out for the kindle fire so excited yeah cant wait to play it today yeah yeah yeah!
B0051BVQFG|4.0|It would be easy to pick apart the technical faults of the movie (hundreds of rounds to kill an alien until they find it's soft spot and then one shot kills?  Too much chatter while moving...), but why bother?  The movie is very enjoyable and the action believable.<br /><br />I thought most of the characters were fairly well developed.  Definitely worth watching.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|because I get to many of one Colorado and none of one Colorado I can only give this game 4 stars. but I do enjoy the game and am happy I downloaded it
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. I liked the options for skill and I liked the extra content after playing the game.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love the new stuff in the game... and now one gets to play as the seriously misunderstood zombie creature
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I have high speed internet, about 48mgs, and the app takes forever to load. I also do not care for the home page screen...too little functions, and the functions that are present, are hard to understand.<br /><br />With that said, I can get my work done using this app.
B0028KF4M4|4.0|I love this series and the characters so much!  The story-line of some seasons are better than others, but the chemistry of the cast just continues to get better every season.  I will really miss this when the series ends!
B000MRA6AK|5.0|I loved the original album with only eight selections, so any additional are just icing on the cake!  If you never heard the original LP then this CD is a steal.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a fun comedy!  The timing and delivery were very good, particularly the Fat Amy character, and it had a good straight-faced sarcastic vibe in places like some of the better mockumentaries.  I recommend this one!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Love the book - published over 30 books now! It is a great book to create my ebooks to download.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its the real deal! I feel like an actual jockey! Best game in a long time! Deffinitely recommend this game for all ages looking for a good time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is the best app in the world I love horses and the fact that I can have one is the best although it's on my kindle it's still AWESOME
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it, very challenging and my husband and I compete with each other.  I was home sick and I played this game 2 days on the couch.  The graphics are awesome and well worth the download.  I now can compete with my granddaughter who is 5.  Lol
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Best movie about singing and dancing mixed in with college problems an romance. Hope you enjoy this movie like I did.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This is a strange story.  I probably would never have read it if it wasn't for a book club meeting.  I did end up enjoying it after I got into it, however.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|Wonderful movie for parents and younger kids.  The movie inspired us to get the Nurse Matilda book as well. Enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Even better than the first book! Emotional and sensual; I could not put it down. I really loved reading it!
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|The acting and action are good, but the writing of this story is horrendous. The author clearly didn't research time travel very well, and the telekinesis bit came out of nowhere. I don't need everything spelled out for me, but some explanation would be nice. Sorry, but it takes more than action and good acting to keep me interested in a movie. Glad I rented this one instead of blowing money at the theater.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I felt the entire book never accomplished anything.  It was (supposedly) just one funny statement after another.  She sounds like she's manic depressive on a high.  It never goes anywhere.  You  keep waiting for it to get to a point and it never happens.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The best exotic marigold hotel.  India setting is glorious.  ULove Maggie Smith Judy drench and all the cast. Brits know how to make a movie
B004LWZWBU|5.0|The Big Year was charming!  It is not just for bird watchers.  The movie makes you really admire these characters because they have something they are so passionate about.  The story is very well-written, with many small moments coming together to create cohesive, satisfying story arcs for the three leads.  The characters are fully developed, both from a writing and acting standpoint.  The scenery is just beautiful--you will feel like you have traveled all over with these characters.  The movie is full of big-name actors, and I wonder if they signed on so they could travel to these great locations.  The birds are fun, but not the important part of the story.  They are just the vehicle for a great story about three guys with a dream.  I am so glad this movie got made and that I stumbled across it.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|I don't know how to get it working with my TV. I set them an email giving them my make and model # of the TV and never heard back from them???
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Fairly good movie. Glad I didn't go and see it in theater. Some parts were slow and other parts didn't make sense.
B0032Y8XH8|2.0|I bought this cd when it had just come out, and it's only sat in my cd rack since then. I personally did not enjoy it. All the songs sounded the same, no variety. I gave it to my cousin who for some reason wanted it, ha. At least someone liked it.
B001KNUQ64|1.0|Sorry I have to say that this does not sound like best version of this beautiful album, even it is marketed as a &#34;audiophile/gold/superhyper&#34; recording. Somehow it sounds a bit &#34;muddy&#34; to me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better graphics bigger monkey or whatever it is. more entertaining and challenging.  prefer this over the brave. version. a great game
B000006FNX|5.0|This movie is outstanding to my husband ,he has watch it since it arrived, in great condition color and sound great for the price  Thank you
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a hair stylist and a mom,so this helps in my everyday life<br />Day in and out! Full of ideas and helpful tips
6305127646|5.0|Well, this is a great movie and my husband is really enjoying it, Thank you so much A great price for a new movie
1594484805|4.0|Very well written book. I enjoyed the writing style. The content was very relevant.<br />The thing that kept this book from 5 stars was that the second half of the book was more of a workbook of &#34;things to try&#34;. While somewhat beneficial, it was a full half of the book!
B007R3AZNK|3.0|I liked the CD but I guess I REALLY enjoy actually watching Joe Bonamassa perform.  His performance is so passionate it transforms him.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|MLP! What else could make this game any better?<br /> I do wish you didn't have to spend money but the ga.e itself is still fantastic!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My family and I love this movie. Great for kids and adults alike. Great storyline. A movie worth investing in
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Vonnegut rarely disappoints me. I have this book in paper back, but he is great for reading while traveling so I wanted out on my Kindle. I can dissolve my physical body and melt into his stories, rendering me oblivious to distractions.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Good book. I enjoyed reading it. I like it. Great book. I recommend this to people who like classics. GREAT
B004TI5N38|5.0|I had read this before, but when I received the Kindle as a gift this was the book I decided to reread first. It was a great choice as I enjoyed it even more this time.  As usual I was gripped to the end.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's an awesome game. I spend lots of time playing the game, but not the best.<br />My brother and I love the game.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|i have this in Mac and i'm glad it has a Kindle version. makes log-ins fast. if you want to add new sites with password access, you'll have to enter it through your computer and it will update automatically in the Kindle version.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really like this book. And I am patiently waiting for the last book of the series! I just want them to get and stay together making it work!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is perfect if you love to solve problems. I have spent hours on this game and I have only had it tot two days. You should really give it a try it is well worth your time. bonus, its free!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awasome love it. too cool too be played! everyone should like it. so better than the old one. love it.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Of course it would be. An easy and delightful read I plan on reading it many more times in my life! You won't regret reading it or easily put it down!
030758836X|3.0|I bought the book because it was on the best seller's list.The internal dialog, stream of consciousness writing, slowed the pace. The book relied heavily on internal dialog which at times was tedious.  The main characters were shallow with no redeeming qualities. However, I kept on reading, after all; it was on the best seller's list, and I was curious as to what happen to the wife. Through most of the book, my response was  luke warm until information was revealed about Amy that changed everything. This increased the tension temporarily, followed later by another scene that increases the  tension even more.<br />The ending, however, left a bad taste in my mouth. It wasn't satisfying, perhaps, too pat.
1475143389|5.0|Less is more. Who would have thought that more time resting muscle groups and more sleep would be key ingredients to really getting big. Who would have thought that by following the routine in this book, five days a week at only 30 to 60 minutes each day would give results that haven't been seen in the past 28 years!<br />I bought the Arnold Encyclopedia back in 1985 and read it front to back. It's a great big book with lots of pictures and lot's of information about body building. I actually still have it. It's a great reference but 3 sets of 10 is mostly what was taught back in those days and earlier. For years I always enjoyed doing all those sets and leaving the workout all pumped up like a balloon. It's a cool feeling but it never lasts. I always seem to deflate down to just a little big and not very solid. Already having a mild base of muscle mass I started doing Mikes routine in this Bigger Leaner Stronger book and I am only three weeks into it. I made up gym charts for every day. I have really dug into managing my daily calories and I write down everything I do. Starting out in fairly good shape and weight I am noticing major results really quick. My overall physique is morphing to much more masculine. My strength is starting to push thru the roof. My energy levels are also greatly improving such that I feel like lifting my kids up over my head, doing Kung Fu moves, dancing in parking lots and jumping over fences instead of using the gate. No drugs just finely tuned health.<br />This book, while about body building, is more a look into what you really have to do to get your engine running at top efficiency. Being a mechanic I easily see how fine tuning your body as a system results in top performance. Adjust your excellent calorie mix just a little rich (a few extra calories) in winter to build strength and size. Adjust your excellent calorie mix just a little lean (a few fewer calories) in spring to burn the little extra fat so that those hard muscles, especially your six-pack, show proud. Then for all summer you maintain that perfect mix of calories and exercise to live, love and enjoy life.<br />The book may seem a little scientific at times but it is easy to understand and it is the stuff you really need to know. Leaves out the unnecessary and provides just what you need.<br />I have clung to this book for weeks now as I find it to be truly the best advice for what it is intended.<br />The book is a half an inch thick but carries the weight of a builders bible.<br /><br />So in summary:<br />1. Tune your diet like the fuel mixture in an Indy car.(if I can do it, anyone can do it)<br />2. Eat how and when your supposed to. There is a meal schedule.<br />3. Lift HEAVY, lift HARD and then REST, SLEEP, REST.<br />4. Bask in all your studlyness. Everyone is going to notice!<br /><br />I also bought the Shredded Chef and Thinner Leaner Stronger for my wife. We are really enjoying these books.<br /><br />I'm actually turning on the alpha male for my wife so this book came at a perfect time. She deserves it! This book is about building the Ultimate Male Body so why not flaunt it. Get your self some clothes that actually fit and show off your new physique. Walk tall with a little more swagger. Wear boots if you can. Open the door for her knowing that you can probably kick anyone's a$$ with your big muscles. Show the other fat dumpy husbands what they're wives are wishing they had. Make other women say \\"OMG, where can I get a guy like that!\\"<br />The way I see it, by the time my wife's birthday rolls around all I will need is a little black and white bow tie and she will be the happiest girl on earth ;)<br />And finally help a friend who deserves better. Share this book with a buddie and offer some gym time. It's all good for the soul.
B004WR125O|4.0|This wireless adapter works well. But if you are streaming large content (like uncompressed audio) you may experience pauses in the playback as I did. I have now wired a Cat 5e either net cable for this system as a result.
B00271HAK8|5.0|As great as I remember! Good for family (10 yo and 12 yo) also. Not much in way of sex, drugs, violence, language.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|avast Mobile Security seems to be working wonderfully. It is also in use on our computers. I think this says it all.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the first temple run this game is better. If you like temple run you can not but like this game .
B0063IH60K|5.0|Definitely worth the price, seeing as it is free. I love that you can pick different dealing types and it's not timed! Recommended to anyone who  enjoys solitaire as much as me! :)
B003PBB4ME|5.0|My son wanted something for his new camera so he could take pics while snowboarding and skateboarding.  It works great and he loves it.
B007XNAOS0|2.0|Ive been a fan of Baroness since the Blue record,I am a musician as well and I understand that bands either keep it safe and dont venture too far from their niche sound or they over reach and experiment too much and what you get is a lot of different ideas that dont gell well together... This double disc recording is such in my opinion...The first track \\"Take these bones away,\\"is a classic, but after that it starts to go downhill fast.I wont go into all the tracks but this disc is so non co-hesive, I felt like this was all thrown together,I love this band and all the great music the have created so far up untill this recording. There are a few other tracks on the 2nd disc that are worth checking out,but all in all I felt this recording does not stand up to the amazing complexity & creativeness of their previous releases.I hope they come back strong on the next recording!!Please!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Great book as always by this author, keeps one in suspense until the end, would recommend this book for anyone!
1936891026|5.0|Imagine your favorite Determinator from fiction. This is the character who just won't stop slogging ahead--the tough-as-nails warrior who grits his teeth and walks into the firestorm knowing full well the price he will pay for his courage. Wouldn't you want the grit to get the job done, no matter what?<br /><br />So often, our work gets bogged down or derailed by silly, insignificant stuff. If we truly mastered ourselves, we could get our work done and have time for the things we love. To do that, we must cultivate an attitude of cool professionalism; we must identify the obstacles in our path and eliminate them.<br /><br />This book teaches you to become unstoppable.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The plot turns and twists in this Grisham book along with the fine character development makes it a Grisham classic.
B008AX18Y6|4.0|What stands out most about this book is the naked honesty of the writing. This alone and most importantly, makes it a winner. Those offering flaws in Rushdie's character and actions as criticisms of the book, are foolish to not realize that if flaws are to be found, it is because they are laid out before the reader. If he was unfaithful and allured, we know it because he acknowledges as much. It it not a nuance captured by your scathing insight in a book offering cover-ups. Of course, what makes the book immensely absorbing is the thrilling and real tale not just surrounding the author but spanning countries, peoples and ideologies, replete with delightful anecdotes and fascinating events.<br /><br />If Rushdie doesn't interest you, this book may also not (surprise?)<br /><br />To me, this memoir read like a novel that grew most interesting towards the end where the writing was somewhat paced, more passionate and eloquent. The writing overall is unpretentious and flows. For those of you annoyed by the arcane nature of his fiction (that occasionally includes me), this is also a reprieve.<br /><br />If you don't know already- this book details his years under the fatwa and all the politicking that took place. Besides, Rushdie shares the very personal and intimate details of his life and gives you enough to enable you to psychoanalyse his actions- the protracted endurance of a bad marriage, the ending of a relatively pleasant one- but like I said before, he never offers excuses but lays out circumstances and frequently self-incriminates. Whether you find him at fault or consider his actions only human under the situation is entirely upto you. He does not tell you what to think. Rushdie opens himself up to scrutiny with candour. Your criticism of his moves is not criticism of the book- the book wins all the more for its ability to offer that capacity to its readers.<br /><br />For those who find him self-absorbed, well, this is an autobiography. If you find the armed Jaguars and the high-level diplomacy pretentious, the story couldn't be told without these. He IS a celebrity so expect celebrityhood and high and mighty company. Several big names are thrown about (I did not know a lot of the literati so lost out on what could be interesting anecdotes), but don't expect him to go on a tangent about your favourite people. This is HIS memoir. Don't expect Christopher Hitchens or Martin Amis or whoever you like. They find respectful mention and as much acknowledgement as is necessary to tell his tale.<br /><br />If you are fond of Rushdie, I highly recommend this. If you are a religious bigot, I recommend it even more highly. Chances are, you will see reason.<br /><br />There's a whole world of people that owes Rushdie an apology.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I'm a big John Grisham fan and have read almost everything he has written. This is an all right book but not Grisham's best work.
B00022LRXA|4.0|This is the only CD by Brian Eno that I want in my collection, and I do like it.  In general, his other work is not to my taste.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|My case had many problems!! The screen does not fit correctly and i am not able to push the button on the side to turn my volume on or off! And also the top right corner next to the camera is broken off!

B001NLKT60|5.0|Can't stop reading once you start, I am almost halfway through it in one week. Gets more interesting every chapter and you never know what to expect!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's fun to play while you're waiting, say at a Doctors office. The  graphics have always been great. I find it fun and challenging.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This book was difficult to get into.  After, it was extremely graphic in violence and survival techniques.  I found it painful to read and if it hadn't been a book club necessity I would have quit many times.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This whole series is a must read! And this installment was a perfect ending. Lisbeth Salander is one of the best heroines ever!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched the first 2 seasons in a marathon 2 days.  This must be one of the best series ever made.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|As a child who grew up listening to the Phantom and Les Mis since I was old enough to remember, and I think this production is phenomenal.  Mackintosh and Karimloo have put together one of the best productions to date, and the post show ending is a great treat as well.
0143034901|5.0|It is such a mixed blessing to find books that are of this caliber and about which I'm this passionate. I finish books like The Shadow of the wind (and Pillars of the Earth and The Hummingbird's Daughter...and the handful of others in my lifetime) with such mixed feelings. I want to get to the end; I don't want it ever to finish. By the time I reach the halfway point I'm already worrying about what I can possibly read next that can compare with the book I'm finishing.<br /><br />As a writer I am in awe of the skill of Carlos Ruiz Zafon -- who has written a complicated book with an even more complicated plot -- with a story line that telescopes and expands as it writhes and circles through a variety of points of view -- and even as each different narrator brings us his slice of the story and shows how yet more of the characters we've passed in the street are connected to those we already know and love (or hate) the story line remains not just clear -- it's pure, slick, sleek and rich.<br /><br />Amazing book...great story, greater skill.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Not only is this a fantastic Christmas album, but I listen to this at all times of the year just to hear Mr. Buble's voice.

B005OOL1IC|4.0|great movie, not as funny as the first one,but still funny.i had to get it to go with my blu ray collection
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you liked the first temple run you will love this one! The graphics are amazing and the sound effects are better and there is more to it! Zip lines, mine carts, and wheels with spikes!<br /><br />Every once in a while... it does close out on its own which is upsetting....  And there isn't as many characters to get in this version compared to the first one, but I think the graphics make up for that. I am so addicted to this game!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a horse lovers dream game !!!!!!! So much fun it is like taking care of a real horse get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the BEST GAME EVA FUN FUN FUN IF YOU ARE A HORSE LOVER THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU

B009VB97EY|2.0|Unable to get into the story--very poorly developed.  Not enjoyable to watch--except for the guys!  Sorry I wasted my time and money.
0307960471|4.0|I have a soft-spot for detective/mystery stories set in Scandanavia.  I've worked my way through Sjowall and Wahloo's Inspector Beck series, Mankell's Inspector Wallander series and Stieg Larsson's Dragon Tatto trilogy.  So I am at a loss to explain why I hadn't pick up a Jo Nesbo book before this.  That said, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Set, mostly, in Oslo, the jaded, time-worn Inspector Harry Hole returns from a self-imposed exile in Asia to come to the aid of the son of the love of his life, Oleg, who has been accused of a drug-related murder.  Saying much more would likely lead to too many spoilers so I'll just say that the plot is intruiqing and contains enough surprises along the way to keep even the most sophisicated mystery devotee guessing.  The characters are well-drawn out, are quite human, and have all the complications and character flaws that most of us have.  Still, they carry on.<br /><br />In reflecting on the book, which is the third in a series centering on Inspector Hole, I wish I had started at the beginning and worked my way through.  Nesbo does a good job of filling in the back-story without it looking like an 'in-case-you-missed-it chapter' so reading the earlier volumes was not essential.  However, seeing the character develop over time in a series is something I find enjoyable, so I'd suggest that anyone interested in the series do start at the beginning.<br /><br />In any event The Phantom is well worth reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game is really better than the first temple run!!!! I really just love it so much!! Lol
B0064MGU98|5.0|Such a great show, good story line, something different from everything else out there.  I wish it was easier to get the older seasons though.
0307341550|4.0|This novel is the sort of book that wreaks havoc on even the strongest of mental states, and is, consequently, nearly impossible to put down. The raw, often unsettling emotions and deep, troubling issues that are explored in this book, combine with a thrilling mystery that you just HAVE to solve (especially once you start considering the \\"what ifs\\") to create a deliciously upsetting, painfully good novel. Props to the author for her fantastic writing!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I bought this book for my Kindle and it has made my 45-minute commute go a lot faster! Another quirky page-turner from Mr. Larsson. His characters (especially Lisbeth) are fleshed out even further in this book, and full of surprises. I will admit that the math discussions went right over my head--so I don't know if there was any connection between those and the structure of the plot, but it at least showed yet another facet of Lisbeth's personality. I haven't finished the book, but my one criticism so far is the unlikely setup the author used that put Blomkvist exactly where he needed to be at a critical juncture. On balance, however, this book is a real thriller and I will definitely be purchasing the third book as well.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Did not like the drag in the story...same scene kept repeating...characters takes way toooo long to come to the point
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Saw this on my birthday the year it released.  Continues the story set in motion by the first Sherlock Holmes film in this series.  Eagerly awaited it's release on blu-ray & it looks amazing.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A book that was quick to read. Also very easy to follow and fall in love with each character. :)
0525478817|5.0|I finally--FINALLY-- read it! Regular visitors know how much I don't like contemporary, but this isn't just contemporary. This is so completely different from anything else I've ever experienced. When I finished reading, all I could think was \\"Why did I read this?\\" It's the most painful experience I've endured in a very long time.<br />I don't think I can really review this properly. The characters weren't just characters, they were real people. They had such real emotions that I can't describe them in a single paragraph! Hazel was just...wow. Augustus was just...double wow. Just trust me. If I go into any more detail I might just burst into tears.<br />The famous quote everyone's seen at least once sums up my thoughts about the book perfectly:<br /><br />\\"I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once\\"<br /><br />It was exactly like that for me. I started out just sticking my feet in the water, giving it a little taste. It was good, but not great. Then the next thing I knew I had fallen in, overwhelmed by how incredible it was. Once I reached a certain point (those who have read it know exactly where), I was a wreck. I just started sobbing. Thanks to other bloggy friends I was prepared physically with a giant box of tissues, but nothing could prepare me for the emotional trauma that was suffered that afternoon.<br /><br />Moderate Language and Sexual Content: (Multiple d*** s*** a** f***, kissing, descriptions of making out, Augustus and Hazel do sleep together, but it's not explicit at all, crude and suggestive humor throughout)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a great game and its a little harder than the first temple run but still really fun. But the thing is the first one is more fun in my opinion and sometimes the screen glitches and it is really annoying
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've been playing this on my Ipod its so much more fun with the bigger screen!! Now waiting for the game app Hay Day to come to kindle fire!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a beautiful book and is worth every penny. It's certainly one of the best books I've ever read.
1878424114|5.0|Super speedy! Great price<br />Couldn't ask for anything better - wish I would have known there was a sticker on the front but its no big deal! Would use this seller again!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I laughed and enjoyed the writing style it was like she was sitting there talking t o you.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a laugh.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game. It works wonderful on the Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Even if you have never played before, you will find it hard to quit once you start.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great adventure game. And when you get bored you know what you can do play temple run
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Oops!  This is the DVD that was damaged not UP.  Great Customer service on returning and getting a replacement.  The Up DVD was a Christmas gift for someone.  Both shipped fast.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I can't believe I have now finished a second reading of A Feast for Crows. This time around I read the books according to the prescribed method found on [...] I prefer this method over reading the books straight through. A Feast of Crows is a disappointing book if read straight through. It has very little of our favorite characters. Since both of the last two books start immediately after the third, the continuity seems to get lost.<br /><br />In this second read, I had the advantage of watching the television series so as to  know the characters better. I don't think I had that going into the books the first time. I caught a lot more innuendo that I missed before. The bottom line of this read is that George R.R. Martin presented a world that was basically misogynistic, but full of good and bad people of both sexes. Each character was human with light and dark thoughts. Even the bad guys/gals had light thoughts and vice versa; that humans try but even while trying, fail. George did seem to project the idea of what women go through and glorified those women in his books who managed to pull up to their male equals and the dangers for those women that are power-hungry and not just wishing for equality. (Sorry for the awkward sentence there. My mind is a bit fuzzy right now.)<br /><br />Once, again, I must sing my praises for narrator, Roy Dotrice. Yes, I would prefer that he not use leprechaun voices for women and/or Tyrion. Still it is handy to separate the characters. I listened to him on the Audible version as I read an ebook version. BUT--The Kindle version is now only $4.99. That is a 50% discount!!! It still isn't text-to-speech enabled, nor is it lendable. For those of us with cash-flow problems, the books and cds are now at the libraries.<br /><br />Below is the review of my first reading.<br /><br />***<br /><br />NO TEXT-TO-SPEECH. NOT LOANABLE. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! AND ONLY A MACHISMO WAY OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD. POWER, POLITICS. WOMEN ARE AT THE LEVEL OF SHEEP OR COWS. And as I am reading this I remember being forced to read such as this in school and teachers telling me it is wonderful and a classic. Male teachers, no doubt.<br /><br />I read to escape real life. If it wasn't that I want to have an honest conversation with my adult children about this series, I would not be dragging myself through this. It is dark and bloody. This world is even worse than the world we live in now. It may help women who read this to see and remember how far we have come and yet how far we haven't. As long as books like this praise rape and plunder and this is considered the usual behavior of males in our society, we will never have a society of peace.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I do respect that the author has managed to keep tabs on all his characters. The writing is good. The plot is well strung. There are some phrases that I find irritating now as after this many books WE KNOW. But maybe it is how the author keeps the characteristics unique?<br /><br />Anyway, I am on to book five. I think I see the light at the end of this tunnel. I have so many other books I want to read!P OR COWS. And as I am reading this I remember being forced to read such as this in school and teachers telling me it is wonderful and a classic.

B004UFEJVW|5.0|Gave 5 stars because of great customer service.  First DVD was damaged.  The return was simple and quick and another DVD arrived same day I sent the damaged one back.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Jones and Streep deliver exceptional performances. It resulted in some deep discussions with my wife and me. But, it isn't a &#34;feel good&#34; film; it gets a little depressing at times.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|very awesome game there's a mining tunnel Witch u ride in a cart the rope you slide down. that's why I think its AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We are totally hooked on this English soap opera.  We just discovered it a few months ago and have been &#34;catching up&#34; as quickly as possible.  Love it, love it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great app. I recommend this app to everyone. I love it. It is so great anyone should get this app.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|Bought for a member of the family and he has played with it non-stop since Christmas.  He never bores of playing with this.
B00338QENI|4.0|I read this book as the first for a book club and it proved to be a very enjoyable read. I don't normally pick up a non-fiction book like this very often but in this case I'm glad I did. I honestly did not know much if anything about Henrietta Lacks besides a vague recollection of her name from a science class when we had talked about HeLa cells but that had long since been forgotten until I came across this book. The story its self is quite amazing considering everything that the author had to go through to get this story and the fact that she got the family to even see her seeing how they have been treated throughout the years by the scientific community.<br /><br />The book does a great job of keeping a balance between the scientific and human side of the story. I personally liked more of the scientific research and findings that are a result of the cells and just the magnitude of their impact in our countries medical history. I am also astonished at the fact that the family was keep completely in the dark about everything for so long.<br /><br />I did find the story a little odd in the fact that the author wrote about herself in the story but I guess it fits in that she became very involved with the family and was a big help in getting them some answers. I would recommend this story. It is not a light read and some parts can become very technical but it is a very interesting read and about a subject that is very important in how our ethical medical research is conducted today.
0486295559|1.0|I studied this book in a first year Romantic & Victorian course which I did not enjoy. I found Persuasion difficult to get into and did not enjoy it. I studied an 18th Century Fiction course and enjoyed Mansfield Park and other very interesting novels. I did enjoy this course.<br /><br />I'm returning to Austen because I recently purchased Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, and I feel it would be a crime not to read the original first.<br /><br />If I enjoy Pride and Prejudice I might just return to reading Persuasion again, just to see if I find it a much better read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing I've read it so many times can't get over how amazing it is. This book really connected me and my nerdy friends I owe most of my relationships to books like this.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I always think it is difficult to go by someone's review of music, since I feel that a person either likes a song, or they don't no matter what anyone says.  But, LUMINEERS IS A MUST BUY!  They are just a fun, feel-good band.  Love them!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best I have read. It held me captive the entire way. The characters were complicated but very believable..
B000SGRONM|5.0|As usual...very funny with his own unique way of looking at the world!  David Sedaris never disappoints with his stories.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Still reading. Can't wait to see the movie in 3D.! Going this week. I know it wont be as good as the book but more exciting
B000SEJHRA|5.0|David Sedaris absolutely cracks me up!  His stories of his family and growing up in Raleigh are particularly fun for me to read since I grew up in Raleigh (and now live near his brother).  He is a master spinner of tales!
B00005JKZ3|5.0|This is one of the few series where the sequel was (in my humble opinion) just as entertaining as the first.  Love Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once you get started its hard to put down.<br />I really enjoyed this novel and can't wait to read the next two books in the series.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I bought this as gift for my niece and she loved it.  I haven't personally seen it, but her opinion on the subject of animated films is far more informed than mine.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome I<br /> never got tired of it and I can't wait until the next one come out<br /><br />. Just wow
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I believe there are quite a few bugs that need to be fixed, I get gems and try to use them and oeridivakky when I click save me it throws me out the game and she. I okay again the gem is gone.Also there's some lagging in swiping and sliding, once those are fixed this Hamnet will be GREAT
B009O2XY12|3.0|A good game but some levels are not easy enough or clear to know how to complete.  The game does keep you entertained
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|This wasn't so much scary as it had an unexpected twist.  I enjoyed it.  If you like suspenseful thrillers, I think you will like this movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game rox! but it is a lot harder than the first one bcs you cannot see where you are going until it is already happening.  besides that this game  is definitely a must have!
1439170916|2.0|The writing style is adequate, if not very exciting. It often reads like a history lesson, but it's not organized in a very intuitive manner, and frankly becomes very boring at times. The author insists the story of cancer is full of these colorful characters, but aside from a small few they are not written with much color. If you're wanting a medical view of the history of cancer, there must be better places to get that. If you want an entertaining pop-science view, this isn't that either. It falls uncomfortably in between the two and left me unsatisfied at the end, hoping for a book that wouldn't brush off the details of treatment when it gets too complicated for the non-expert, or else would tackle the stories of those involved with less dryness.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I was expecting something funnier since I heard such rave reviews, but I feel like it fell short. If you're a family guy fan, you might enjoy it more.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Excellent read. I was introduced to this book a few months ago but didn't purchase it until recently. I absolutely love and agree with this book 100%. It works
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|There is not enough words to describe how much I love this movie. It has every older action actor I love. Every. Bruce Willis is the main characted! COME ON! There is nothing better!<br /><br />I bought myself this for Christmas and immediately watched it a half dozen times until my boyfriend refused to let me watch it anymore. Something about not watching the same thing over and over and over again for days in a row. Whatever. He's wrong and I'm secretly watching it over and over when he's not home.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|3 stars. I could not dream of a better fantasy to easy my dull days. Copper haired men are my new thing.
B001KZG99A|5.0|ROBERY DOWNEY JR. Marry me.<br /><br />this movie. I watch it nightly. I will continue to do this and only swap it for Iron Man 2.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|it was a good season i would highly recomend if you enjoyed bones its like that but with a slight twist
1419701533|3.0|My baby likes this series. Not a literary work of art, but as long as she is reading at an 11 grade level starting 2nd grade on her own; I'm proud to spend the money on these books. Somewhat timeless in scope and humor.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome book I couldn't put it down only took me two nights. Anyone want to read an A+ book u need to read this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just got this app it is great I love it its great for people who love horses like me
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Let's agree to disagree.<br />Boris the animal very scary.<br /><br />Boris The Animal:  What's your plan?<br /><br />Young Boris The Animal: Prevent the Ark Net from being deployed.<br />Kill anyone who tries.<br /><br />Boris The Animal:  Good plan, didn't work.<br />LOL
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I've been a fan of New Who since Christopher Eccleston, and I'm really starting to warm up to Matt Smith in this season.  I will say, however, that, for me, the mid-season finale was WAY better than the season finale.  Good season, over all, though!
B003KJF2WE|4.0|It's the HULK!!!<br />What More do you need to say!!!<br />He is a Super Hero!!!<br />HULK SMASH!!!<br /><br />3 More words
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I'm writing this review because the app asked me to do so.  It is very good for the color noises (blue, white, violet, brown, pink).  There isn't a sound on here that I don't fancy.
0783225482|5.0|This movie is a classic, and I literally watch it at least once a week. It's so witty and Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep really play off one another.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I've purchased several battery backups.  They were all about the same size.  All claimed three phone charges per phone.  This one does it!  I just bought two more after I've used my first for a couple of months.
0691126658|5.0|This is a comprehensive bird book with beautiful and clear illustrations.  Descriptions are good, and the ranges accompany the text.  The book weighs nearly 2.5 pounds, so if weight is a consideration for luggage restrictions, a buyer needs to know this.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|This is a very moving story of survival and love.  It gives a lot of insight into the struggles within Afghanistan and the treatment endured by women.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This was a real help in getting my book set up for kindle. The process was pretty painless. It will be so much easier next time and the next!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love love love love iitt !!!!!!! x x x x x x x d x d x d d x dbenej fjf
0399160450|5.0|And now another great adventure book is added to the long list of great books by Tom Clancy. They are both fun to read and a place to learn a thing or two.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you wanting more! Can't wait to read the next one! Suzanne Collins is a brilliant and inspired author. Keep um coming
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Thank you. It sounds great and we revisited the feelings we had watching the movie. I should become a classic.
B00AP5Z2F8|3.0|This is a no frills instruction manual on how to get usable video files.  This is basic only and is primarily targeted at the unskilled.  Do not purchase this if you are looking for a reference work or non-standard applications.  It is probably worth the money.  I am totally new to video so this was a good start for me.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The case is easy to use and protects my Kindle fire. I would have liked a few more color options rather than pink and black.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We bought this for $39.99 before Christmas 2012. This purchase can't be beat at that price point. On the other hand, I have seen this offered on Amazon for as high as $69.99 and I wouldn't buy it at that price, if only for the inclusion of the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. All fans should be paid to watch the trainwreck that is KotCS. It should be noted that these movies are amazing in blu-ray. Buying the traditional format DVDs and going through upconversion doesn't do these movies justice. The digital re-formatting has brought new life to each of these movies. I noticed many nuances in the first three movies that I didn't originally remember seeing in the theater. Harrison Ford and Sean Connery turn in amazing performances throughout the series. Shipping was fast (two days) with prime and the set came well protected.
1616550414|5.0|Originally a tie-in with Skyward Sword, This 276 page book of extraordinary artwork covers the history of Hyrule. It's an absolute must-have for any fan, if for nothing else than the timeline. But the original sketches and illustrations that have never been shown before now and in-depth details and backstory of all the characters make the pricetag totally worth it. There's even 32 added pages of Skyward Sword manga by Akira Himekawa included. Absolutely gorgeous cover to cover. You will be pleased.<br /><br />Happy 25th birthday to the Legend of Zelda! This book was worth the wait.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft pe and now that the new 0.6.0 update is coming out in a few days it is going to be awesome because they are adding signs, armour, and lots of new stuff if I could give it 10 stars I would give it 20
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute game. Great way to show kids  animal care and help them understand the responsibility involving horses. I find it very relaxing to play.
B004C3DLJS|3.0|Kids get antsy and move to something else when movies become more about the words and less about the animation.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book captured my attention so much that I could not put it down. Very reciting and enjoyable. Very philosophical. Thank you
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was skeptical but I put it in my computers browser and the software was very easy to find and was absolutely free to download onto my computer.I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the home screen from my computer displayed on my kindle fire HD. I tried to set up a home network between my desktop and laptop for months only to find that there was not a way around the incompatibility issues of Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. The firewalls are very different but to gain remote access into both systems I just needed an application like Slashtop 2... Now I have access to all of  my information on both pc' s though my Kindle Fire. It was a bonus that I didn't need to purchase a Bluetooth keyboard for my kindle to use at the house. now I just use the one connected to my computer in the living room. It is connected to my laptops usb port and I can just type away. My son broke the LCD screen on my laptop so I had to use an HDMI cord to connect it to my 50\\" Big Screen Tv. The 5$ I paid for Slashtop has saved me the cost of replacing my laptops screen for a while. Now my Kindle is a thousand more times worth the money I spent. It's a remote control to use both of my my computer and my laptop and everything I want to watch on my Kindle can be streamed to the Big Screen. I have quite the setup:) Thank you Splashtop.... Awesome app!!!!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Not a high school student anymore, not in many many years, but so able to relate to this story. My father has been gone for a while and my mother has lung cancer along with other issues, but I think this story has taught me how to handle everything my family is going to go through. Great read.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Quality construction for its purpose, very functional and appealing to the eye. Of all the colors available I prefer/chose black.
0741470314|5.0|This book is a must have for both Michael Jackson fan and all the people who want to get a view about the greatest superstar in our time.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|A real page turner! I was so into it I couldn't put it down! My teacher had to tell me to put it away during class! You HAVE to read this book!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched it in theaters...loved it.<br />Found out everyone from work loved it to.<br />Now we all sing the soundtrack in the kitchen.
B0086700CM|1.0|stupid bastards make it so easy for your kids to spend $ on worthless crap, this app just takes advantage of you. These people suck
B008SLAXGO|5.0|You must have this book if youre a big fan of Lady Gaga.. It has Big Pictures never seen by Lady Gaga On and Off Stage..

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loveless this game.. its the most real life horse game iv ever planned.........its a really fun and caring horse game I really like it
B008HK3XOU|3.0|The color is a lot brighter than in the picture; it's literally red.<br /><br />The feel is very nice as well, and it's pretty sturdy. You can't rotate the case, and there's no magnets to lock it close, but it's a nice case. I probably won't get it again though.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great app and I enjoy all the different games. It's fun to play on your down time.  I'm glad I downloaded the app.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|some pieces are  really hard to find but I like it. The story is good. It's keeps me interested  and busy for more than a few hours.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This series was so good! Read every single book! Guess i gotta start the next one! I HIGHLY recommend, unless if you haven't read the ones before
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of my new top 5 favorite books, I fell it in love with the story and the authors sense of humor and view of the world.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is soo cute! I love how you can interact with the horse and train it,this is also a great ah to teach responsibility of taking care of animals,so five stars for me.
0060839872|5.0|I could barely notice that it was used. the book itself is a hard read but it explores good themes
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Yes, I was one of the people who voted a zillion times to help Scotty McCreery win American Idol.  He has such a wonderful voice and is so good at connecting with an audience in person and in conveying emotion through his voice.<br /><br />Happy with this album and really enjoy listening to it.  Scotty is young and he has some artistic growing to do, but he's got the goods,the great voice and the good heart.  Give him a listen, you'll be glad you did.
1400052173|5.0|the book was in good condition but the story was amazing! i love it! i was only going to use it for school but now its part of my library
B005ZUR724|4.0|This is a fantastic game for those who love fantasy online multiplayer gaming. The controls a easy to grasp and well implemented fir touch devices. The artwork is impressive and the gameplay is smooth. Quests are small so that you can actually do casual questing. Definitely a must play game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Unbelievable, really an amazing book that I can't wait to return so I can rent the last to this fantastic trilogy.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|So far so good on this diet.  Book is an easy read, easy to understand.  And while it may not work for some, it is working for me!  WTG
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A fun read.  Somewhat predictable but still it held my interest.  A neat twist at the end that did surprise you.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|After the Series Firefly ended, they made the movie Serenity to wrap up the loose ends for all of the fans.  I think they did a good job.  I really enjoyed the film.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|Great Product. Exactly as i expected.I've been looking for a good, simple knife sharpener to get the job done and this has exceeded my expectations.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I tried to re-size in various ways to get the pics to show up to no avail. The info is great! The Kindle format however, is lost on this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing best book I have ever read I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good thriller
B005V4FJC4|4.0|This is now my new favorite christmas album.  I love Zooey's voice and the she sings the old classics.  I highly recommend it become apart of everyone's christmas collection
B009O2XY12|5.0|Love it!<br /><br />Would 100% recommend this product -- Spend too much time playing. It is great for old and young
B005CMSDLE|4.0|This is a very &#34;Euro-style&#34; movie with its emphasis on quirky characters mixed in with a traditional action story of revenge. Saoirse Ronan, Eric Bana, and Cate Blanchett, and Tom Hollander are all stand-outs in their roles but the actors who played the quirky but unfortunate that befriends Hanna are excellent.<br /><br />It is clear what their fate is in the movie but apparently the studio told the director to avoid highlighting their fate. A much better and much more interesting conclusion would have been to have had the their daughter save them by after having learned from Hanna in much the same way that Hanna learned from her. Hence my 4 stars instead of 5 for this movie.<br /><br />Still, a good movie with an amazing soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book as much as I loved the first and second books of the hunger games.  I could not put this book down and never wanted it to end.  I cannot wait to read more of the authors books.  Suzanne Collins is a captivating writer.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Living in the city I have always need some background noise to help me sleep. I don't have a tv in my bedroom because of the light and this app is perfect for helping me get some decent sleep. Variety of sounds and a timer are very handy.<br />The only reason this app does not get 5 stars is because it FORCED me to write this review. Don't let that take away from how good this app is.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|&#34;Les Miserables&#34; is written so well I can't put it down. I plan to read &#34;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&#34; after I finish &#34;Les Miserables&#34;.  This is real literature.  I'm so glad I have finally discovered Victor Hugo.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|As someone who is not really into too many SCI-FI flicks, I found this movie to be incredibly good. The storyline was not that bad either. I absolutely enjoyed the special effects that this film had to offer.
B001EBYM8U|5.0|i can't say much more than this movie is awesome.  the whole movie takes place within one day, so in effect, whenever i watch it, i need to watch the entire day unfold until its end before i can do something else.  washington and hawke were meant for these roles and i wouldn't change a single thing about this movie.  top five.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very good gameplay. It doesn't make you pay to level up. You are able to get to the<br />next level easily. My game loaded quickly on my Kindle Fire.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Real good no brainer reading and relaxation. JR gets into lots of trouble but always comes up on top of things.
B000WAEK0E|3.0|Van Morrison's arc is so extensive and his phases don't please all the people all the time - this really is an artist where you should just burn your own compilation.  But caveat Van's got some great albums so after you purchase a core group of albums - then download some mp3s - you'll have fun arranging them.  I'm actually on my second compilation.  For instance Moondance has a stellar side one but side two is weaker (albums remember we had to flip them - well no one flipped Moondance that's how good side one was so that album is perfect for ripping mp3's off of)<br /><br />Here's my suggested albums to own followed by my latest 80 minute mp3 collection:<br />Tupelo Honey - Hard Nose the Highway - It's Too Late to Stop Now (Live) -  Veedon Fleece - Common One - Hymns to the Silence - Down The Road - At The Movies.  Some people are more into the early years (gloria) but I'm more into the mystic/secular vs the overtly religious (thats just me) I wouldn't argue taste - Van's like a 100 flavored ice cream store - so pick your favorite albums and burn the rest - some people are ga, ga over Avalon Sunset - I say rock on with your bad self but not for me.<br /><br />Here's my suggestion compilation and order (keep in my mind this is my second burn - trust me I have Moondance covered)<br />Across the Bridge Where Angels Dwell<br />Precious time<br />I've Been Working<br />Blue Monday<br />The Healing Game<br />I'll Be Your Lover Too<br />Sweet thing<br />Crazy Face<br />Someone like You<br />The Way Young Lovers Do<br />Saint Dominics Preview<br />Stranded<br />Close enough For Jazz<br />In the Garden<br />Inarticulate Speech of the Heart (part 1)<br />Celtic Swing<br />Scandinavia<br /><br />The albums these cuts came from are Astral Weeks - Beautiful Vision - Born to Sing - His Band and Street Choir- Inarticulate Speech of the Heart - Still on Top.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|McCartney is like Van Morrison and Springsteen his output and arc is massive - that's a good thing - lots to choose from - that's a bad thing no one disc is going to be epic - like the first few - its a hit and miss proposition - not every song is going to be a masterpiece and certainly its the rare album thats going to be mind blowing one song after the next.  Be that as it may Paul has some beautiful work out there its just up to us to assemble it into our own collections burn mp3s - watch the cost be stingy and you can distill it all down to a few albums you must have (Ram - Wingspan) and a compilation or two.<br /><br />Here's my compilation mp3 ideas and sequence - fits on an 80 minute cd<br />Accentuate the Positive<br />Little Woman Love<br />Sunshine Sometime<br />Riding into Jaipur<br />Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five<br />The Song We Were Singing<br />Baby's Request<br />My Very Good Friend the Mailman<br />Souvenir<br />Dance Tonight<br />Used to be Bad<br />Cut Me Some Slack<br />Big Barn Bed<br />We Can work it Out<br />Blue Moon of Kentucky<br />Honey Hush<br />Letting Go<br />Reception<br />Spin it On<br />That Would be Something<br />Hey Diddle<br />You Gave me the Answer<br /><br />The albums the selections came from are: Band on the Run - Driving Rain- Flaming Pie - Kisses on the Bottom - McCartney - Memory Almost Full - Ram Deluxe - Red Rose Speedway - Run Devil Run and Unplugged.

B0055PMJMW|2.0|Each story seemed abrupt and underdeveloped. Not what I am used to with the Harry Bosch novels. They seemed like &#34;bad starts&#34; that were turned into short stories.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like this game because it was cooler and better than the first one. This to me is the fourth best game I played, because there is way more better games than this one but this one is definitely going on my tablet.
B003QSMC18|4.0|I'm not a big fan of musicals, but the music in this one was really good. Even my 6 y/o son was tapping along to the songs while watching the movie. Typical, predictable disney movie ending, but very enjoyable.

B000002AH7|5.0|You can't do better than Davis' Sketches of Spain. It's a perfect bridge to jazz for the Romantic Classical Guitar fan, and vice versa, giving a cool jazz fan an insight into the works of Rodrigo, et al.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy read, romantic and relatable. I would definitely recommend it. The characters were well written and it gave a new dimension to Vegas marriages.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I think it was a good game. The graphics were really good. Cool weapons and effects, the campaign was really good. Multiplayer was really fun also, being able to rank up like call of duty. The game was not lagging in any way, with no crashes or freezes. But the controls were kind of difficult on my big Kindle fire, but it was okay. Recommended to anybody who plays call of duty or battlefield.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|An enjoyable game for horse lovers of all ages. It would be even better with more variety in selection for those of us NOT willing to spend real cash,  but otherwise I have no complaints!

B00B2V66VS|3.0|i bought this for kindle fire, but it keeps on shutting itself down every couple times i play itand i have to redownload it, losing all my stats. other than that it's fine
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is way better than temple run original version.  it gets kind of addictive but its awesome.  I would deffently suggest u get it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book has easily become one of my favorites.  Although the plot centers around an international virtual reality video game, it can certainly be enjoyed and appreciated by non &#34;gamers&#34; alike.  I found myself thoroughly engaged in this story throughout the entirety of the read.<br /><br />Certainly worth your time!

0393343405|4.0|THE SWERVE, How The World Became Modern (2012) by Stephen Greenblatt [won the Harvard professor a Pulitzer] puts the Greek Epicurus back in the spotlight.<br /><br />A historical textbook of sorts, yet moreover an adventure: ferreting humanist thought that led the western world to swerve away from the tyranny of credulous, fear-based religious dictates--plus a pious sponsor's derivative and highly profitable extortions--and toward human advancement (such as freedom of thought, speech, pursuits of happiness, and scientific inquiry) that at long last began precarious political and cultural ascendancies--perilous and fragile ones, it turns out.<br /><br />How and why did an obscure Florentine book-hunter with exquisite handwriting track down a nearly 1,500-year old, 7,400-line poem--a meditation on the fear of death--neglected inside a German monastery in the early 15th century, then serve it up (however inadvertently) as a civilizing deviation from in-power practices--a swerve so unnerving to the Roman Catholic hierarchy that its gripping, systemic orchestrations of angst and superstition eventually lost their force, wobbling into irrelevancy? How did this unrhymed hexameter undermine anti-science, anti-humanist stances--ones stifling human progress for centuries--and lead us to enlightenment? How indeed, Lucretius? Err, how indeed, Greenblatt? Such questions are at the heart of criticism leveled at this book: An answer to How is largely unspecified; the headliner: `how the world became modern' is largely unaddressed, yet the thornier sideswipe is that Lucretius' role is way overstated. Wow, we critics do expect a lot inside 263 pages. The counterpoint to interject is this: Greenblatt opens doors to underappreciated periods in antiquity and Renaissance Europe, and gives us a darn good peek, suggesting how these Ages influence ours. Thus he enriches as well as intrigues us.<br /><br />A poem, you say, off a dusty monastic library shelf, led to consuming change? Really? Its author proffering 1) `evolution' over vast stretches of time...2) nope, no reason to hold humans above all other animals...3) we ought consider conquering fears without foisting man-made ones on fellow men and women...4) our sun is but one star in an infinite universe, around which Planet Earth revolves. 2000+ years ago, he wrote this!? Talk about the unexpected. Talk about a swerve.<br /><br />Uh, hold the celebration. We're barely 300 years out of harm's way. Or are we? Consider the 20th century's wholesale slaughters. In the 18th, French Philosopher Denis Diderot (1713-1784) spent months in a dungeon for speaking his truth, and warned us that no matter how far a society might progress in support of freedom--of thought, assembly, or open discourse--there remained a likelihood that it would regress whenever dogmatism and corruption took root. Indeed. Human history is rife with backsliding. Within the past 500 years--but a spit in time's ocean--curiosity was said by the Church to be a mortal sin (!) Oh yes, the apostles of moderation and reason had to be muzzled.<br /><br />With documented detail about a) writings before the Common Era (BCE); b) prominent Renaissance figures; c) Papal curia goings-on--referencing Vatican jokes n humor, Greenblatt's work is work. So what may possess you, oh casual bookworm, to take on such cerebral effort? Would you be interested if pre-Christian philosophers hypothesized `atoms'? Or if a respected 21st century monolith had used intimidation and torture routinely to drive brave souls--deeply curious about the true nature of our planet--underground? Curious, are you, about its mindful, intelligent victims, the less fortunate--the ones put to the fiery stake--and why we the living, the educated--in relatively free 21st century societies--owe these heretics abiding gratitude? Now then, where was this Lie Factory, Poggio?<br /><br />Greenblatt tags `heroes' and `villains,' just not with such terms. Here, in my view, is a shortlist of his heroes: Epicurus (341-270 BCE); Titus Lucretius Carus (99-55 BCE);  Ovid (43 BCE-18 c.e.);  Quintilian (35-100 c.e.); Petrarch (1304-1374); John Wycliff (1320-1384); Coluccio Salutati (1331-1406); Jan Hus (1369-1415); Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459); Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519); Machiavelli (1469-1527); Copernicus (1473-1543); Montaigne (1533-1592); Giordano Bruno (1548-1600); Thomas Harriot (1560-1621); Galileo (1564-1642); David Hume (1711-1776); Denis Diderot (1713-1784); Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826);<br /><br />This literature suggests life-enhancing, heterodox notions: 1) being freed from harmful illusions is not the same as disillusionment; 2) persisting in learning the way things are will awaken your deepest wonder; 3) unappeasable desire is an obstacle to happiness--each of these ideas, and many more, is in On The Nature of Things, composed by Roman-born Lucretius more than twenty centuries ago, a Latin-language work proposed by Church authorities to be added to their Index of Prohibited Books in 1549. After all, the afterlife and its gruesome punishments for humanists of all stripes is what the club's leaders have so counted on, and for which many earnestly pray, even today.<br /><br /> p.s.

B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Absolutely superb,  Never having cable or having been exposed to this before I bought my Kindle fire,  I'm really happy with this, have bought series on DVD's  since I like it so much.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! The new twists and turns make it even more interesting than the first game, and even more addictive.
B001HN697M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it,  Have picked up all the Underworld series for modest prices on Amazon and  they all fit together really well.  Like the Selene  Character really well....

B009POCG5Y|3.0|Clint Eastwood resurrects his grouchy character from \\"Gran Torino,\\" this time as an aging scout for the Atlanta Braves.  As his contract is up for renewal, he faces the usual effects of getting older, but his deteriorating vision could jeopardize his career.<br /><br />In a by-the-numbers story, Gus (Eastwood) has a successful daughter (Amy Adams) who is on the cusp of making partner in a high profile law firm.  Gus and Mickey's (Adams) relationship is strained to say the least.  Mickey's mom died when she was about 6 so dad was responsible for her care.  Rather than spend time with her, he pawned her off on relatives most of the time.  We keep waiting for the real reason which eventually comes with a thud.<br /><br />Gus is sent to North Carolina to scout a highly prized slugger in high school.  When Mickey learns of her dad's eyesight problem, she meets him.  He's not happy of course, grumbling all the while.  Why?  It is here Justin Timberlake is introduced as a former prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Gus who blew out his arm.  He's now a scout for the Red Sox as well as a potential love interest for Mickey and some comic relief.  This movie signals where it's going more often than a third base coach.<br /><br />It also adds the traditional Hollywood treatment of secondary characters.  The high school star is a real dick; cocky, arrogant and just unlikeable.  So we are set up for movie revenge.  Likewise, Gus has to deal with an assertive executive (Matthew Lillard) who wants Gus out of the organization.  He's also portrayed as a real jerk, just so we can smile when he gets his due.<br /><br />This movie is certainly the other side of 2011's \\"Moneyball\\" where technology and statistics are the winning formula.  \\"Trouble with the Curve's\\" plot line relies on Gus's ability to calculate a player's potential by the sound of the bat.  I'll take \\"Moneyball\\" both as a movie and a strategy to find good players.<br /><br />Well, there is certainly no trouble with the Blu ray transfer.  Delivered in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the picture is clear and crisp.  Every Eastwood wrinkle is there.  The colors are excellent as are the black levels.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option is likewise excellent.  Nothing in particular stands out, but the crowd ambiance and the dialog are clear.  No issues with the package.red in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the picture is clear and crisp.  Every Eastwood wrinkle is there.  The colors are excellent as are the black levels.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|sometimes shuts down but over all a good game. I like horses so this entertains me. if you are not into horses you may find this game dumb and pointless.
0761169253|4.0|It's an easy read but contains valuable information anyone can use. When I was in school many years ago it was drilled into me not to copy anything. We had to submit only original material. I took this to heart and have tried not to copy anything. Now I know I can take another's idea and change it to make it my own.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Entertaining, Exciting....can't stop watching it!  This thriller keeps you guessing all the time.  Will probably finish watching season 1 this weekend.
B0006B2A42|5.0|I would highly recommend this picture. This is a very entertaining movie and typical of<br />the books writtedn by Alistair McKlene.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|It's COol Hand Luke and the picture is the best ever.  Anything else needed be said. Also a few decent extras.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I think it's good but,when you exit the game any time without touching exit it won't save all the money you gain.Other than that it's pretty fun to pass time but,would get free just I case you don't like the game.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Enjoyable fantasy. Many episodes were quite disgusting. Some descriptions were hard to visualize as riding the waves and flying fish not to mention a floating island. But, all in all a hard to believe survival story.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It was a beautiful story, written with great sensivity. It made me cry and after I finished reading it, I only wanted to go back and read it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was wonderful i could not put it down. It was a great love story, but there was some hard parts in it about sexualy abuse.  i would recomend this to anyone
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lots of fun. Great graphics, fun mini games. My only complaint is if you want to purchase some of the optional content its kind of pricey
B007RE0SCW|5.0|This was a great find for me, will order more from this line for my girl's b-day.<br /><br />We especially  love the movable arms and legs.
091581112X|5.0|Can't wait to jump into this one. Love what I read so far and I know I'll love the rest. Can't wait to do all the meditations and finish the book. I'm hoping by the end of this book, and combined with other teachings form other books, I'll be able to do a lot of miraculous, spiritual and supernatural things.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What  a wonderful story. Couldn't put it down. It's a must read story of love and suspense.!!  Loved it so much.!!! Can't wait for the movie
B00AMBH70S|2.0|This movie is a 45 minute motorcycle chase. It has nothing to do with the prior &#34;Bourne&#34; movies. It was a waste of time
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|I &#34;purchased&#34; the product (free) intending to get the paid version if I liked it. It does'nt show up anywhere on my kindle. I thought I did something wrong so I tried again The device said I already have it. Wasted a lot of time trying to find it. Never did - gave up!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is played much more easily than some other games. In this game it is much better than some other games on this particular game.
B00899F0G8|5.0|i love this show hipe it keeps going, i love the actors in it and hope spencer and toby will always stay together lol
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Reviews are better than the actual movie.  That being said, it was entertaining and we would recommend it.<br /><br />Efeects were solid and acting was OK.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best running game I ever played I think it's better than subway surfers because this time it has more things that make the game even harder I can't stop playing it
1451627297|2.0|I really don't know what to say:  this was a great premise for a book; the \\"what if you could go back in time and save Kennedy, kill Hitler, stop Pearl Harbor, or whatever\\"  scenario.  In King's version, Jake Epping, a 35-year English teacher has the opportunity to go back in time and attempt to avert the Kennedy assignation.  Epping is introduced to the concept of time-traveling and the prospect of saving Kennedy by Al, the proprietor of a local diner.  Apparently there is a \\"rabbit-hole\\" in the pantry of the diner that deposits anyone climbing through to September 9, 1985 (always the same date).  Al asks Epping, a man whom he only knows as a customer, to \\"carry on his mission\\" since Al is now dying.  After thinking about this for precisely one day, Epping goes back in time and lives there for five years while he concocts a plan to stop Lee Harvey Oswald.  The story starts out well enough and then it just falls apart; it is a rambling, clich&eacute; ridden mess where the past is romanticized/sanitized and the protagonist develops amazing (read: unbelievable) skills (spying, shooting, planning) .  Great concept, lousy execution; this book would have benefited from a heavy editing hand, 300 less pages, and two less story lines.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best part about this game is that you can do what ever you want. IT'S FIVE STARS FOR A REASON
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like this game, it just took me a while to get used to the tiles. Especially all of the flower ones. It works well on my kindle fire. I just wish that games to download didn't pop up after each round.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great action book about a truelyh fearless man who represents a cross section of a great unit of the military he fought evil with. This is not fiction. Just a real picture of what courage looks like.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Great value - gets the job done for the most reasonable price I could find.  Does exactly what you need it to do, and looks great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just like real life! I love the game. Love it, love it, love it! I wish more games were like this. It is awesome
B00935KWWO|5.0|I've been trying to find a great Twitter app to use on my Kindle Fire, and so far, this is my favorite.  (I've tried TweetCaster, UberSocial, and a few others).  What cinches this app as my favorite is the easy integration of multiple accounts, something I've found to be awkward or impossible with the other apps I've tried.  You swipe to change Column view: Timeline, Mentions, Direct Messages.  Two taps changes which account you're viewing.<br />One thing I dislike is that the &#34;default&#34; Timeline view is an amalgamation of all my accounts.  I keep them separate for a reason.  So each time I log in, view a link, or send a tweet, I'm returned to that amalgamated timeline.  It's simple to select just one, I just wish I could choose which would be my default view.  I've searched the Options for a way around this, and perhaps there's one there that I just haven't seen.<br />The ads are small and unobtrusive at the bottom of the screen.<br />All in all, a great app.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I hated being left hanging at the end. I desperately wanted closure for everyone. It felt like a cop out like the author got tired of writing the story.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|There was no conflict to make this book interesting. Basically the author stretches the story  so everything can be perfect for the main character. It's a boring book with no imagination and should never ever be compared to Harry potter. I think a 4th grader wrote it.
1577314808|5.0|This is one of the books I love to return to for re-reads. I always notice new things - and wind up gaining new insights.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I've heard so many great things about this book and I'm glad I finally got to read it. There were a few times where I just wanted to reach in and shake Abby and ask her what the hell she is thinking (well - this could also go for Travis)! I can't wait to read Walking Disaster. Loved this book!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Adds more detail to the movie, which I highly suggest one see before reading the book.  Quotes are worth copying and keeping.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was awesome! Once you get into it, you don't want to put it down. Loved it and can't for more from Colleen Hoover!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book hit home for me on many levels.  The fact that Dr. Alexander is a Neurosurgeon who is quite familiar with the brain, yet, freely admits there's so much that science does not know is in alignment with my beliefs.  God was a part of this book.  When I went to order it, on the advice of a friend, I did see a rebuttal book titled something like, &#34;A Christian's response to Proof of Heaven.&#34;  While I admit I haven't looked at that book, this book is not a Dan Brown, Jesus was married type of book.  Proof of Heaven lends credence to the belief that God loves us unconditionally, and organized religion can be a way to be closer to God.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who believes in unconditional love.  There is only One source of this love, and this book helps solidify that belief statement, in my opinion.
1607066017|4.0|I went it thinking that this story would be some kind of Sci Fi, and was surprised to find that it splits Fantasy and Sci-Fi right down the middle (ultimately leaning toward Fantasy).  I would characterize it as  a Fantasy in a Sci-Fi setting that is well written, with some beautiful art on the pages.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I think the game is really good it is addictive it keeps me up all night but get the 49&cent; one the other one you have to update.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|It probably won't make your best list of all time fantasy books, but the Blade Itself is very entertaining. Select characters are well rounded, and the story is fun and not overly predictable. The writing is good enough that you won't put the book down, and the whole thing is a relatively quick read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game for the horse lover I really enjoy playing this game it is pretty close to life like and has the interaction that you would have if you have a horse except of course it is a game will recommend this game to all my friends
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Mmm. I absolutely enjoyed this novel- and its twist endings. I was surprised when i was completely wrong on what choices i thought the charavters would make. Beautifull written, my sisters keeper is a fresh storyline
B004UNX1LS|1.0|I was excited when I saw there was a VEVO app but the video quality is extremely poor.  I'm not sure if these videos just look that way anyway or if it's just because of my Kindle Fire HD...
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Amazing game. Everything was included when we opened the package... the 4/5 stars is only because some of the pieces are a little flimsy, but that doesn't affect anything, just not a perfect score.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a wonderful book! It really hooks you into the characters and circumstances! I would recommend this to anyone!
B004DM0UII|4.0|Got during free app of the day. Love the comedy and talk channels while working. Recommending to others. Need to reach 20!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun and super realistic.  any horse lover will enjoy this game.  even the sound effects are just like the real thing
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is so good my is so good it is so epic this is my favorite<br />Fretemple run  I also like that it is free I love temple run 2.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Loved the game until I got to lever 55 and got stuck.  Haven't touch it since.  too cheap to pay for hints.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|Storyline was great and graphics awesome. Really enjoyed playing this HO game on my Kindle Fire HD. Puzzles were on the easy side but it didn't detract from game play. I would recommend this game. Downloaded and played without complications. Looking forward to the next one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is really fun because you get to learn how to take care of a horse and buy different  horses
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Played this game on my Kindle Fire HD without complications. Thoroughly enjoyed playing and really liked the storyline. Hope more games are made like this. I would definitely recommend this game.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie was so much fun to see. The cast is fabulous, the script fun with a nice story and the music is perfect! I hope the rumors of a sequel are accurate, I certainly am wanting more!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is a steal and performs like advertised. If you want style and protection at a good price along with functionality this is the case to choose.
1616550414|5.0|This book is massive and full of awesome concept art, explanations and developer insight. A must for any Zelda fan.
B009Y4E414|5.0|I don't often write reviews but this CD deserves nothing but the highest ratings. Eva Cassidy had an amazing gift that has -- without question -- stood the test of time. Beautiful, timeless and second-to-none are words that quickly come to mind when I listen to the songs on this album. My only regret is we are left with far too few recordings of her gift.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I REALLY love this game and I did get to play it at first,but now I'm giving it three stars because whenever I tap the icon, it goes to the loading screen for awhile and then it just goes back to the home screen. I just want to play my game! :(
B008J34466|4.0|I listen to the same helf dozen or so songs over and over, I can do without the cursing in the others.  But I like Pink, so I had to have it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great movies at an unbelievable price. I already had the first 2 on bluray  but at 35 and change, I couldn't pass up the set. Plus, all three on UltraViolet is a plus. Great deal.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you should get it because it has more then one game on it .that is yaw I got it so you should get it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy to read. Good compelling characters and story line.  A good escape.  I can't wait to finish the series of novels.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I have moved all my music to Amazon Cloud Player, as Google Music was limiting and iTunes Match was a joke for me.  Really l ike the service.  But Amazon has invested so much, seems like they would invest in a more robust app for their music.  But it is a simple easy to use app.  Play back is good, but not excellent, has so much potential.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very interesting and addictive cube game!  I usually play it until the battery dies!  Its kind of like playing a speed matching game compacted into a cube.
1400064287|3.0|This book didn't keep my attention at all. I tried on several occasions to pick this book up, but couldn't continue.
B008AYA7WE|2.0|I think this game is a bit boring and it is very slow compared to a different tetris type app I just recently installed which I like better.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie is fantastic fantasy fiction.  This book is the first book in the First Law Trilogy.  The book flows easily and you are left wanting more at the end of the book.  The first thing I did when I finished reading it was download book two.<br />The main characters are all very unique and the book itself is an intriguing character study.  The primary characters are Sand dan Glokta, a crippled Inquisitor; Jezal dan Luthar, an arrogant and self-centered young soldier; Logan Ninefingers, an infamous barbarian from the North who once fought for King Bethod but has been summoned South; Ferro Maljinn, a former slave who knows how to handle a blade herself; and Byaz, who is a wizard with plans that he keeps to himself.  This book is fun reading from start to finish and I can't wait to see where this trilogy takes me.
B006WQLH7G|1.0|I was mostly looking for real time security for web surfing and I am not sure if this app does that.  It really doesn't matter in my case if it does or not because in order to use ALL of the features of this app your device MUST BE ROOTED.<br /><br />I cant use the GPS tracking option on this app because it claims that the feature to allow the GPS tracking option was removed from newer Android devices.  It wants me to download Avast anti theft rooted so that I can use the GPS tracking feature but apparently I can use the other features so it seemed.<br /><br />A recent UPDATE for the app caused the apps FIREWALL to STOP RUNNING, so now I cant use the firewall option anymore.  The app is now saying that the FIREWALL will ONLY work on ROOTED devices.  The only thing this app seems to do NOW without the desire to be ROOTED is scan apps immediately after download.<br /><br />If I cant use this app because my device is NOT ROOTED why is the Amazon app store saying this app is compatible with my device when it is clearly NOT?!<br /><br />I am now looking for a different security app for my NON ROOTED tablet.
0307463745|4.0|This was a quick read with a lot of depth. I enjoyed the straight forward, candid perspective. Sent one to my boss, anonymously.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|Its looks okay if you are online but I wanted an offline app.  The app claimed you have to connect to the internet before you use it the first time so I did, and later when I went to use it offline it claimed nothing was downloaded and it needed and internet connection.<br /><br />I have since read in other reviews that this app wants too many permission/personal information in order for you to use it online.<br /><br />I found one I like better that is both on and offline but is more focused on being an offline bible.
0061122416|5.0|I seriously like to read this book once a year as a motivational tool. For me, it serves as a subtle kick in the ass to persevere in life.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|If you're going to remake a movie you should make it better than the original. Think I'm over 15 minute long action scenes.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|With Steve Carell in it, I thought it was going to be a comedy. However, it turned out to be serious about a 31 year marriage in a rut. I believe their problems are common to many marriages and long term relationships. This isn't exactly a chick flick, and definitely not a first date movie. However, I did enjoy it and would recommend it.
1616614609|5.0|This Is a really amazing 2 player card game. With elements of deck building and bluffing, it is a very unique and interesting experience. While it does rely on random draw(it is a card game), it never feels too heavily based on luck and there always seems to be something you could have done differently when you lose, making the game very addictive. Playing as the runner/corp, as well as the various factions for each is also a completely different and very fun experience so it stays fresh even after many plays.<br /><br />The core set comes with a great variety of cards and deck building is very fun and easy. While the game does take a bit of time to get a hang of the rules and vocabulary, it is not terribly complicated and ends up being very worthwhile and rewarding. Looking forward to picking up some data packs in the future.
B002L5CNRA|5.0|This is the best movie. I have watched this movie over and over. I love the whole gangester thing. If this is something you like its a must see.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I loved it. Great acting and a witty script really make this film worth a watch. Too bad it wasn't nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, but I suppose it may not have been worthy of that award anyway. Great film nonetheless, I recommend this to anyone who enjoys quality, clever movies.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The first season was all about high schoolers doing high school things.  It was about innocence and doing good.  This was the season that caught everyone's interest.
B00122S4KS|4.0|I had actually bought Paramore's other two albums, &#34;Brand New Eyes&#34; and &#34;Riot!&#34; before I purchased this one. Obviously I liked what I had heard with their other two albums, so I thought I would give this one a shot. Honestly I prefer &#34;Riot!&#34; and &#34;Brand New Eyes&#34; to this one, but that doesn't mean this isn't a great album. It has a punk sound that you can get pretty pumped about and catchy tunes like &#34;Emergency&#34; and &#34;Pressure&#34; that will keep you coming back. You can tell Paramore was really trying to find their sound with this album and clearly they did otherwise they wouldn't have been propelled to super-stardom. If you're a fan of punk music or just a big Paramore fan (like I am), then this one is definitely worth a buy.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Movies like this are always special!

0783226888|5.0|The story line fit the plot well. The rifle technology followed a previous movie &#34;The Shooter&#34; aka &#34;Point of Impact.&#34;
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is an awesome game... when it will actually run. It runs a lot smother was far as graphics go on my kindle fire than the 1st game but everytime I get a decent score above a few million points it forcecloses on me when I die and doesn't save my progress! I hope they fix the bugs in it soon
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved the whole series!!! If you haven't read them yet....you need to a.s.a.p.!!!!!!! My only flaw/heartbreaker was that Finnick shouldn't have died :( (sorry for any spoilers). Otherwise, amazing books!! I plowed through them!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really good book to read, very detailed. It really shows the feelings of every single characters in them. This sad story has a really good twist that changes somebody's life for the best.
B004S82OAE|3.0|Book is a great start for your ccna certification, however dvd was never sent or mailed. Dvd was offered and included in the purchase. WHY??
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this game is good but after about well a lot of times playing it you probably will get a bit tired of it.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|Very entertaining and somewhat educational.  Good light reading. You will learn about life in Africa and the problems, some humorous, some not,  of the ordinary people.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|In the game temple run you hang from a zip line ride in a car and did most regular temple run 1 things.  This will make you sit for a while and play.  I really enjoy this game and the other temple runs like brave temple run and the regular temple run

1846556007|5.0|I was a bit worried because the title was in German, but the book description said it was translated to English.  I sent an email and recieved a prompt response that it was in English.  The book arrived sooner than expected and was in perfect condition. Thank you
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome new chacters choose your own board and it is in New York every one should get it if you like temple run 2!
B0012NIF56|1.0|Seen now, it's hard to believe anyone liked this version of Superman. Reeve's simpistic take on Clark Kent just grates: it isn't acting, it's mannerisms. And Margot Kidder is simply terrible. The action is not believable, the pace slow, get me out of here!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the temple run people finally get us this game is so much better than the first temple run also better graphics
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I really enjoyed Game of Thrones, but at times it seemed to progress rather slowly. It does a good job of keeping your attention and filling you with suspense. I would highly recommend it.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The movie was good. Kristen Stewart did the best acting I've ever seen her do, she isn't very  good actress. Charlize  Theron and Chris Hemsworth were amazing as the Evil Queen and the Huntsmen and the special effects and costumes were great. I liked the overall story and will tell my friends they should watch it.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I have found that most of the time when I purchase a Blu-ray/DVD without seeing the movie first I get disappointed a lot.  Based on the two prior movies I took the plunge feeling as thought it was a safe bet.  Despite the horrific tragedy which, I know most are aware of, I was able to get absorbed in the movie and not think about it.  We loved this movie as we have the two others before.
B0027MJU00|3.0|story was a little much, but I did like it, Not as good as her last book Gone Girl though
B001DPHDCY|3.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas (from Santa), and it came in great condition. Not a huge fan of the movie after seeing it--it doesn't hold my attention very well. It's okay for $4, though.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|A lot of violence and was a bit blurry in HD mode. Would not suggest it to anyone to view.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|I think the CD is okay. I got it for $1.99, and there are a few songs I enjoy on the album, so it was well worth the money spent.
B000001ESN|5.0|I remember buying this when it first came out, cranking it with the headphones on 3 or 4 times because it was so amazingly good!!  8th grade, first thing I would do when I got home from school was throw this on the turntable and crank it up!  Never heard anything that came close to what they put on this album before.  The musical structuring of each song is just ingeniously creative and unique!  Definately some of Alex's best guitar work up to that point in his career.  Neil's drumming once again just left you in utter amazement at his creativity and mastery of his instrument!  Surely some of Geddy's best bass lines ever and his voice was still in peak shape. The Spirit of Radio was a great lead in for this album, an awesome, hard driving rocker that just barely prepares you for what's about to follow!  Every song is just meant to be listened to at full volume!!  A classic album that must be in any true Rush fans collection!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Interesting view point of the Kennedy assasination.  I really enjoyed how he handled the time travel paradox,and the comparison of the flow of time to strings of an instrument.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is a challenge, yet full of logic. I have had hours of fun! I would suggest this to anyone who like difficult puzzles.
B007R41E8O|2.0|Puzzles are fun, not too challenging. Subject matter is way too dark. Unexpected ending is inappropriate for young minds and eyes.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book is a must read for women of all ages!! Full of valuable lessons, the best book I've read in a while!
B000FA5STS|5.0|Originally read it months ago and just finished reading it the second time.  It was still &#34;can't wait to turn the page&#34; this time.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its the best game I think what happens was they do not like temple run everybody likes temple run 2
B0038P59A0|5.0|I've waited for years to see this movie. I'm not a fan of the movie-theater experience, so I patiently wait for good movies to come out via other formats. After watching this movie, I wondered how quickly must I acquire this DVD? The acting mastery of Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law is undeniable and they only enhance each other's performance. Having seen Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, I wasn't sure how this movie would measure up. Well, it measures 5 stars and I can't wait to watch it again.
B002SJ8FH6|1.0|I tried several times to watch this movie and never get any audio, The video streams OK, but no audio
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Although this was my first Nicholas Sparks read, I was not impressed.  I finished the book, and it was entertaining, but absolutely not a mystery.  Very predictable and uneventful.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I am surprised by the negative reviews. The movie was charming and had a good message. Yes, the characters were broadly drawn; it was an animated story about creatures after all. I suppose some of the detractors saw this as anthropomorphism; I think they're taking it too seriously. And it's some of the best animation I've ever seen.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book.  It was laugh out loud funny.  It was nerve wracking.  It brought a tear to my eye at the end.  Fantastic book.  I would highly recommend.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I was not a fan of this book. The layout (letters) made it really hard to follow the storyline. I was confused almost the whole time that I read it.
1594487154|5.0|I sell insurance for a living (property,casualty and life). I also help train younger agents. I have read many books on sales over the years and taken 4-5 different sales training courses (Dale Carnegie, Sandler, Xerox, to name a few). I found that \\"To Sell Is Human\\" added a new dimension to the understanding of how to engage and move people in this era of \\"infobesity\\" (too much information).<br /> Pink points out that today knowledge about everything is ubiquitous and most buyers have the same edge as the seller regarding product information including price!He suggests using a strategy of becoming a \\"product curator\\" whereby you use your knowledge and experience to customize the flow of information to your clients needs.He further suggests that todays sales person needs to be a problem finder as well as a problem solver.<br />In my business, insurance is often seen as a commodity and many consumers are only price motivated. This book has helped me see that as a curator I become more than a purveyor of insurance, I become their personal risk manager and \\"problem find\\" for them issues that may jeopardize their net worth (taxation, litigation and inflation are a few).<br />I highly recommend this thought provoking and practical book to anyone who wants to enhance your people moving skills!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Its fun long term but if you only play it once it's quite boring but when you get really fast it's kinda boring but when you have nothing better to do its ok
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read all 3 books mainly because everyone else was.  I have mixed emotions, basically not overly impressed.<br />Didn't keep me up at night reading.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|This book was a good start to the series and i did enjoy the characters and the plot. I did however, find parts of it to be boring. I look forward to the next book in the series, hopefully it will have a bit more action and background info.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this series because of all the hype, glad I did but can't say I would recommend it.  A little to out there.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book with twist and turns around every corner loved it John Grisham is a wonderful writer and really hope there is a movie to follow
B0090O07S2|5.0|A must have for every Doors fan!  Even if you already own the old version this is worth buying again.  The sound quality and newly restored video is excellent!
0812982622|5.0|It's hard to disagree with reviewers who call this the best novel of 2012. I finished it a couple of days ago and still can't stop thinking about it - it's that affecting. The main character, Jun Do, is a kind of North Korean everyman (it's no accident that his name sounds like John Doe).  One reviewer here found him disturbingly amoral, but I think that misses the point - he does what he has to do to survive in a horrifying world, and ultimately proves himself a man of deep loyalty and powerful emotions. I was fascinated by the glimpse into North Korean society - so often in the news and yet so poorly understood by most Americans (including me). This book made me think, really for the first time, what it must be like to live in that intensely rigid and repressive world, where even your children may be untrustworthy.
0517548232|5.0|Hazlitt lays out the case for a freely operating marketplace quite nicely.  His arguments are sound and the US could use a good dose and return to true free market economic principles like those of Hazlitt.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I totaly enjoy playing this app! It's adicting. If you love horses or at least caring about animals, you will absolutely have lots of fun playing this app!
B000FGFBEE|5.0|Many critics will disagree with my title above.  However, what movies can they name better than this one?  There are a few movies made that are as great as this one- but, if they are honest- none greater.  No matter how small you keep your DVD collection, this film belongs in it.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|As I sit hear typing, the soundtrack to this week's best bet is playing, loudly, on my PC. When I finished the movie I found I wanted to listen to these songs again. I'm sure that this will wear off eventually as all music choices seem to do after a few days. But while the music may change, the amazement I felt at watching this story unfold will stay with me forever.<br /><br />SEARCHING FOR SUGAR MAN is a documentary but please don't let that prevent you from watching this movie. So many are turned off to the term documentary and those that are lose so much by missing movies like this one. This is a story that will captivate you and uplift you by the end of the film. It's a story that begins sad and ends as story that inspires.<br /><br />In 1970 Sixto Rodriguez released his first album. The producers of the album thought they had a hit. Here was someone from Detroit singing about the problems he saw, inspired by what was going on around him and they had helped make this album. With lyrics that brought Bob Dylan to mind, a voice that at times sounds like Phil Ochs, why wouldn't they expect great success. Unfortunately it never happened. Even when his second LP came out a year or so later, nothing. With those two albums released, Rodriguez disappeared.<br /><br />Of course that was only in America. In other countries Rodriguez had a more interesting career and successful one. On South Africa this was when apartheid was going strong and young people were protesting against their government there. A bootleg of Rodriguez' album made its way to that country and spread like wildfire. In the songs found on the album a generation found a voice that spoke of things they were feeling. The government's response was to ban the playing of certain songs on the air which of course only made them that more popular.<br /><br />That's a great story in itself. One would think it was enough. But that's just the first third of the story. That's how amazing this story is. Years go by and things change both in the US and in South Africa. When a CD reissue of Rodriguez' album was about to be released a record store owner was asked to write the liner notes. A questioned posed there inspired an investigative reporter to try and find out what happened to Rodriguez. Word was out that he had died. Stories ranged from him shooting himself onstage to lighting himself on fire before his audience. As the investigation continued, the writer was shocked to find that Rodriguez was still alive and well and living in Detroit.<br /><br />Enough of a story right? But no! Found alive and well these same two men tried to let Rodriguez know just how influential his music had been to an entire generation. A record that sold so low as to make no notice in the states had sold over 500,000 in South Africa alone. So it was only natural that these same fans got Rodriguez to come to Cape Town to perform for those same fans. And perform he did...6 sold out shows to crowds to thousands of people.<br /><br />The story of Rodriguez was interesting enough to inspire the director of this film. The success of the film was enough to interest the folks at 60 MINUTES who did a piece on his story, the only reason I didn't feel I was giving spoilers here in this review. But the truth is that just hearing the story, just knowing what happened, isn't near as interesting and amazing to learn as it is while watching this movie.<br /><br />As with any musician there will be many who aren't crazy about each and every song but my guess is that when this movie is finished you'll be tapping your toe to several and more than likely be looking for a CD by Rodriguez. At the same time you'll wonder why his career didn't skyrocket here just like those who produced his albums thought.<br /><br />The tale of Rodriguez is one that will touch your heart and have you amazed at this man as he is today. What he does with his newfound success is revealed at the end of the film. The saddest thing that could happen is for people to not discover the music of Rodriguez or the man behind it all. This is a beautiful film that tells the tale well and will hold your interest from start to finish.appen is for people to not discover the music of Rodriguez or the man behind it all. This is a beautiful film that tells the tale well and will hold your interest from start to finish.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|After seeing the trailers I really wanted to go and enjoy this movie. The idea is cute but the script is rather weak. Very predictable situations. The acting is good and Ted is adorable while being rude and obnoxious.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|I was fortunate to have the chance to see Bob Clampett speak years ago. Clampett was one of the men responsible for the classic Warner Brothers cartoons and helped create Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and later Beanie and Cecil. One thing he said always stuck with me. He said that during the censorship days of the Hayes Committee, the animators/writers would always sneak in jokes that would pass that adults would get and that children wouldn't understand. This made those cartoons something that adults as well as children could enjoy then. While not every animator these days follows that advice those behind HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA do and the result is a great movie that entertains children AND adults.<br /><br />One hundred and eighteen years ago Count Dracula built a castle/hotel where monsters would find safe haven from the humans that hunted and tried to destroy them. Each year the monsters all gather to celebrate the birthday of Dracula's daughter Mavis. This year will be different though as Mavis' special gift is one left by her mother who died when she was born, to be opened on this particular birthday. Keep in mind 118 in Dracula years makes her in her late teens.<br /><br />Mavis longs to leave the castle and roam the world to see what is out there. Inspired by a post card she found in her mother's belongings of Hawaii, she wants to see what her mother saw, to experience something behind the walls she's known all her life. Her father, knowing that humans would rather see her dead, wants her to say home though and will do everything in his power to insure she does so. He even goes so far as to allow her to visit a local village, not telling her something she'll only discover later about that village.<br /><br />Mavis returns home and all seems to be going well until a stranger shows up. Jonathan is a backpacking teen on vacation roaming the countryside who accidentally stumbles upon the well hidden castle. He enters and finds everything he sees amazing until Dracula finds him. Trying to prevent him from being destroyed by the monsters (who think that all humans want to destroy them), Dracula puts Jonathan in make up and has him pose as a party planner there to help with Mavis birthday bash. When Mavis gets a glimpse of Jonathan, the first person she's ever seen close to her age, they both get a glazed look in their eyes and suffer a case of love at first sight.<br /><br />But human and vampire have no chance for happiness in the eyes of good old dad, so he tries to keep the two apart. Dracula's parties have long since lost their luster and are boring even to the yearly attendees who include Frankenstein, the Mummy, Wolfman, Invisible Man and more. Jonathan livens this up with his youthful ways much to the chagrin of Dracula. Can the star crossed lovers make a go of it? Or will Dracula make sure that the Jonathan stays safe from the rest of the monsters who actually seem to like him almost better than Dracula?<br /><br />It's a simple plot to begin with and ends up offering plenty of items that will inspire tons of laughter from young and old. The old versus new isn't played out to make one seem better than the other, just different. Dracula is not as bad as one would think watching this movie and his concern for his daughter and her happiness is the center piece to the film. The love between the two is one that should be a good point for families once you get past the whole vampire thing.<br /><br />The visual gags here fill the film from start to finish. It's one of those movies that you'll probably want to watch more than once just to catch the jokes you missed the first time. The writing is well done and offers just as many jokes as the visuals.<br /><br />The animation here is fantastic. It still amazes me to see individual hairs on something like Dracula or Mavis in bat form. The detail is crisp and clear and to think that technology has come this far is astounding. The voice work is done incredibly well with cast members likeAdam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Selena Gomez, Fran Drescher and Steve Buscemi.<br /><br />HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is a movie that the entire family can enjoy together. It offers plenty of laughs and a touching story of father and daughter. It also offers a great launch pad for parents who would like their kids to know what the classic monsters were like. Who knows, maybe it will even inspire some to get their kids to watch those classic Karloff and Lugosi films.Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Selena Gomez, Fran Drescher and Steve Buscemi.<br /><br />HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is a movie that the entire family can enjoy together.

B009XTF8KQ|4.0|For those who aren't familiar with the name Sam Raimi my guess is you are aware of the movies he's made. Lately he's been associated with the first Spider-man trilogy starring Tobey McGuire. But long before that Raimi was a director whose first major film of note was THE EVIL DEAD, still one of the scariest movies ever made. That being said I guess it's no wonder that Raimi got into the producing side of the business. The latest film to find him in that seat is THE POSSESSION and it's one of the scariest movies I've seen in some time.<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan stars as Clyde, a basketball coach recently divorced from his wife Stephanie (Kyra Sedgwick). The couple has two pre-teen children, Hannah (Madison Davenport) is the older of the two and of course the standard troubled pre-teen. Em (Natasha Calls) is the younger of the pair and still has high hopes of her parents reuniting.  With a new man in her life that's highly unlikely.<br /><br />On a weekend when Clyde has the girls staying at his place they stop at a yard sale where Em's eye is attracted to what appears to be an antique box with some writings carved into it. Of course she's allowed to buy this and then takes it home. It seems like a puzzle box with no way of being opened, but eventually Em does get it open. And that's when things begin to happen.<br /><br />Small things at first like a single moth in a room. But that escalates when during the night a bunch of these moths show up in the bathroom while Hannah is there which leads them to Em's room which is filled to the brim with them. A phone call to an exterminator and a trip him ends this visit.<br /><br />As the story moves forward Em begins to show signs of becoming different. Her parents think it's nothing more than her reaction to their recent split. But there's more to it than that. A fight at school is described as more than a simple altercation with Em showing a substantial violent tendency that has he withdrawing from her friends as well.<br /><br />Clyde begins to suspect it has something to do with the box and takes it to school with him to have a colleague look it over. The friend reads the inscription which is in Hebrew and says that the box contains a Dibbuk, an evil demon whose spirit is said to be contained therein. Clyde considers this the possible reason for Em's outbursts and throws it away. When Em finds out, she makes it appear he's hit her and runs to rescue the box from where Clyde threw it away. She also causes Clyde to lose any and all custody of the girls.<br /><br />More strange things occur and Clyde continues to seek a way to save his little girl. With more research he travels to meet with a group of Hassidic Jews and shows them the box. They are the ones who finally give him the information he needs to know about what the box actually is. But will they help him rescue his daughter or is she condemned to whatever evil was contained inside the box?<br /><br />The film could seemingly boil down to being called a Jewish EXORCIST. But it's not quite the same. How the case is handled is much different. Yes, there are some similarities but on the whole the story is handled at a slower pace with quite a bit less of the gore effects. This story is more a battle of good and evil. It also deals more with the question of how far a parent will go to fight for his or her child and just what they are willing to accept.<br /><br />There isn't a bad performance in this film. I've become a big fan of Morgan since his days as the father of Sam and Dean Winchester on SUPERNATURAL. His portrayal of Clyde here shows the concern of a real parent for his child and the hopelessness he feels once he discovers what is causing the problem. Sedgwick does a great job as well although her time onscreen seems somewhat limited. What time she does have is well played. Both Davenport and Calls turn in great performances for actors so young. Calls especially stands out as Em, showing the two characters contained in one body convincingly.<br /><br />It's obvious from the box art for this DVD as well as the commercials that ran when it was in theaters (the ones that showed fingers trying to work their way out of Em's throat when she looked in the mirror) that this is a movie intent on scaring the viewer. I've seen plenty of horror films and this one actually did give me a start now and then. But more than just offering a few jump scares, this movie had you in its grip from start to finish. It didn't feel like it had wasted space or time spans that made you want to reach for the fast forward button. This movie keeps your attention till the end. And if you get scared along the way on this trip, then that's just icing on the cake.n one body convincingly.<br /><br />It's obvious from the box art for this DVD as well as the commercials that ran when it was in theaters (the ones that showed fingers trying to work their way out of Em's throat when she looked in the mirror) that this is a movie intent on scaring the viewer.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game has kook sound effects, and the graphics are awesome! It is harder, and more fun. You should totally get this!!! I'm surprised that a game like this is free! Imangi studios is fantastic!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Great app! Easy to use, full of features, and best of all, it simply works. Ive been using this app for a couple years and have not once run into any problems. Good work, dev.Thank you.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, but there was way too much action.  I feel there was more time spent showing action sequences than on his ability to use his intellect.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just love playing it. I like the autocomplete feature. it 's just addictive!  Once you start you don't want to put it down!!!!!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I was glued to the screen; what a great show! I simply could not stop watching. Great story and great acting.
B00B1OEP32|5.0|I've got to say, I'm a big fan of natural instruments and vocals in music today. Justin delivered what I would expect from an acoustic album and it is quite beautiful. However, I would have liked to see a couple of the songs performed and recorded much softer than the originals. He did well with Boyfriend in that respect, but still could have revamped a couple others. He was overly aggressive with the guitar. Sometimes simplicity is better with an acoustic track. All in all, this is a great album and I would expect to see it in the charts. Keep doing your thing Justin.
B00338QENI|4.0|There's so much to be learned, you've got to read this.  Its well constructed and throughly researched, a part of our medical history that everyone should know about.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is really good but my kindle keeps shutting it down I don't understand why its doing this but it keeps closing on me before it even opens for me to play the game and its really frustrating me ..... anyone else have this problem?
B005DOJ68K|3.0|I can't find where it downloaded - in fact forgot I ordered it and it was charged higher than what I saw advertised on fb
B00992CF6W|1.0|lol jk I actually played this game and its okay I guess if I had to rate this for real i would give it 4 stars xD
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 Is the best ever! Fun free easy my kid loves it get the app get free fun  best games ever<br />TEMPLE RUN2
B001NKI60W|2.0|I just don't like it. Acting was good, but the singing was just too...ugh. Plus, not a big fan of the storyline. Just me...
B007TXS512|5.0|Articulo 100% original, mercancia en buen estado.<br /><br />gracias por el envio todo muy bien.<br /><br />el tiempo estimado se retraso un poco.
B003YTPS7O|3.0|The movie on its own was a delightful movie.  It had some funny humor and a decent story line.  It was lighthearted and easy to watch.  With that being said it was not true to the storyline of the book.  If you have the opportunity I would highly recommend the book as well as another book by Peter Mayle called Vintage Caper.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was glad to find that HBO stayed true to the book. If anything was different, I didn't notice it. :) I LOVED the book and the TV show was AMAZING. Great quality! I am looking forward to watching season 2!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and has probably watched it 50 times.  She loved being able to finally read the book.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|movie was ok though a little slow.  ending predictable, but sweet.  did not enjoy the gay character aspect, could've left the old flamer out, but i guess that's just a sign of the times, every program must have their token gay.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I have liked Bruno Mars since he first came on the scene but I had not purchased his music.  After seeing him on Saturday Night Live recently, introducing his new release, I decided that I was going to treat myself and buy the CD.  I'm happy to report that the music is tight, the band is awesome and Bruno is well--Bruno.  Hurry and download this CD.  It's awesome.  I am a fan for life.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book was very accurately written.  The history is real and the story enticing.  A book that is not easy to put down!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great book! It kept me wondering until the final pages! Just when you think you have it all figured out it changes!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not great, but not bad.  I love John Corey as a character, yet this novel had way too much repetitive social commentary that I found myself skipping through to get to the action.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book had great reviews and seemed very interesting based on the small portion I read provided by Amazon. I am still reading the book, so this review is a bit early, but I'm only finishing it to finish it. THe names of the characters are ridiculous and the story line is so high school. A bit young. This book is more geared to teens/young adult.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. I have read all the books and Im glad they made the movie. There were some parts of the book they didnt put in the movie but thats what to be expected in movies.<br /><br />I was completely satisified that it came so fast. I purschased on day and expected to have it arrive on friday. But I was surprised that it came the next day after I purchased it. I couldnt wait to watch it.<br /> It was unscratched. Completely packed properly and I gave it 5 stars because I never expected it to come so quickly.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Simple, no time pressures, play when you can. Great time killer when you're on the go. As many or few opponents as you like.
0060763280|2.0|It is just a book which encourage you to dream big. No real stuff! I felt it was not helpful. 2 stars only.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin writes a consistently compelling account of Lincoln and his many challenges. It is informative and drives one to delve further into the history of the Civil War. It is very readable. I only wish there were easier ways to go back into the text and review items for further clarification. I love my Kindle, but this is a drawback.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This CD is a MUST! Taylor Swift is breaking away from her \\"country\\" genre (In my opinion)and I would say this is more pop than country. This is still a VERY nice, catchy, and fun CD to listen to! I listen to it in the car, while studying, and at the gym! It's an all around great CD!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Needed this movie on CD as I no longer have a VHS player. Rizzo is awesome. You cannot go wrong with the Muppets.
B000VIPJKM|4.0|Glad to see at the end of the movie all ended well! Some fantasy moments  All in all I would recommend this movie to friends.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am a big fan of these books this one was very exciting. I couldn't stop reading. As usual this author has me spellbound.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I just wish he released it sooner, because a lot of the songs I was already playing them out, before they hit the radio.  But overall LOVE the album!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I found that the case not only helps me to use my kindle fire more efficientyl it protects it from damage. I take it with me all the time.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Interface is easy to use. Quality of sound is average. Number of available sounds (great, since you can download more within the app). Features are ok. Sounds do not sound good while using the phone's speakers, but if you use external spreakers the quality improves. I have tested several similar apps on both Android and iOS, and this one is my favorite on Android. Now, between both OS's, this one would be the third.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I loved reading the &#34;Dragon  Books &#34; by George Martin.  They take me into a whole new word of fantacy.
0316228532|5.0|A Casual Vacancy is an excellent book.  Well written, great wit, very tragic.  One of the best books I have read in the past 6 months.  Kudos to J.K. Rowling for tackling so many topics with such wonderful insight.  This book starts as a nice story about people, but goes behind closed doors and reveals all.  It moves on to subjects that exist everywhere, but most people don't want to see or talk about.  Many surprises, tragedies, and great writing.  Do yourself a favor and read this fabulous book.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is incredibly awesome=) 5 stars I have referred some people to Dragon Story totally sweet game you should play it
B004UJAOLM|3.0|This was a good story, but very hard to read. I enjoyed it, but would only recommend reading it if you happen to be an avid reader. It is definitely not appropriate for someone who isn't an avid reader.
1582406723|5.0|My son is 12 and doesn't read a lot unless something really catches his attention.  He loved this series so much he read the first three books within 4 days.  They have a comic book quality, but plenty of dialog to go with the pictures.  His last series was The Hunger Games, so he is an above average reader.  Hopefully that helps gauge whether or not these are appropriate for your child.
B006LSZECO|3.0|We read this psychologial thriller for our book club and all our members liked it.  It is a fast read and holds your attention.  It is very disturbing subject matter.  In our book club discussion,  the group leader asked the question:  Do you really think there are people in this world like the two main characters??  The majority of the group did not hesitate to answer yes.  That is disturbing.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book is a collection of short articles on various topics concerning living a minimalist lifestyle, including dealing with unwanted heirlooms, what's in a minimalist kitchen, and how to declutter - each full of practical tips.  I love that each article is short, allowing me to read one or two at a time when I have a few minutes to spare.  I will caution that she is an extreme minimalist and some of her advice may seem extreme, but I still find her advice extremely helpful!  This book is definitely worth the money if you are looking to simplify your stuff and your life.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|Love this stylish n light weight plus all black. I will get a different color in near future. Nice watch
B0087JTAKW|4.0|&#34;The Time Keeper&#34; is one of those books that you don't want to put down as you become so<br />interested in how it will end for its leading characters.  Original thought is part of this author's success.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My sister got this game before I did and I wasn't sure if I should get it. So I played it on her kindle and fell in love with the game it's good for people who want a horse
B006LRUVUA|5.0|TeamViewer for Remote Control - the best app to view and control your desktop when you are not at home or at the office !
B00AYB20KI|3.0|We were looking for a scary movie to watch during the week when nothing else was really on TV. While we weren't scared by this movie, it was mindless and had some action. We were entertained enough to watch the movie without complaint and never really considered stopping it. I can't give it any more or less than three stars. We watched it, were marginally entertained and didn't regret paying for it.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Simply brilliant; the interviews are great and you learn new things about Bob that you never knew.<br />Plus his music plays the entire time!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel keeps me posted so I can make sensible plans.  I can also watch weather around family and friends in other parts of the country
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very funny and fun<br />It was sad that Greg did not get a date or get together with the other girl so yeah God book can't wait for the next one!!!!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google provides me with quick information.  Google is great for researching anything.  I use it a great deal.  Easily accessible
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|How wonderful to turn on a TV series and have the absolute security that the show chosen will be presented in not only a professional manner, but be truly entertaining in its genre, and will have a great ensemble cast that is well directed.  How enjoyable to KNOW that the historical background and back story is presented in exquisite detail and faithfully brought to the screen in line with the historical back story.  In total, this is truly a sweeping, fascinating, beautifully presented TV series. Can't wait 'till the next episode comes to life on the screen.  Thank you so much for this magnificent series.  Thank you to the producers, director(s), scene designers, costume designers, actors, everyone that has anything to do with bringing such a gold star series to us!!!
0987300911|5.0|good，i think.the serve is good，and the book is good，i believe that the book can help me to improve my english ！
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I feel like I've tried them all! Free and paid, simple and complex, and this version is bar none the greatest. So many options and types of game play and the best part is you're never guessing which tiles are open/available!! Top notch! Can't recommend it enough!
B001O1O71C|4.0|I recomend this book to anyone 10 or older because of the vocabulary and content that requires more of an understanding.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Saw this movie a couple of years ago and decided to make a purchase to add to my collection.  Great cinematography.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|The end was great with all of the scientific evidence and historical events and I find it great that I am now ready for a zombie war!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|okay, so I earn over 3,000 money in this game. not much I know, but when I play some more... I have 1,000. I did NOT buy anything. so where is the money going?!?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love the trilogy!  I read it almost obsessively. I honestly wish that Katniss wasn't so naive, I have to remind myself that she's only 16.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I recommend The Homeland series to anyone who has a deep interest in the world events that have unfolded over the last 15 years or so.<br />Where is season 2--we are anxiously waiting for this to be available on videos on Demand!
B0053O89WY|5.0|is what I choice I can have from where I'm live and is really some I like to was a gift so thanks was from Cindy Halliger
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I enjoy this cd so much! It adds a special flair and facet to the books...love it love it love it!,
B00746TURW|5.0|Wonderfully written book, totally engaging from beginning to end. Could see myself reading it again, which is unusual for me
034580404X|3.0|It has a really good story line but the sex was just too much which is why I gave it 3 stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever!!! x) i loved it cuase it has objective and it has other thing but i wont spoil it for you.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|downloaded it to kindle fire. got to play it once. loved what I played. tried to start the game the next day and program crashes after imangi studios page. please fix so I can play it again.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is an easy to use app that will utilize GPS feature (if included on your device, including the GPS on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4g), to get the weather where you are.. It provides an radar weather map feature that allows modification to your own preferences.  Multiple time frames from Now to a Ten day forecast.
0060589051|5.0|Excellent learning materials; surpased expectations; great book to be listened while driving.<br /><br />Great choice to learn.<br /><br />Really recommended for learning!
0439813786|5.0|Then bought this for my 8yo.  He really loved it.  I haven't read, but he tells me the movie is pretty true to the book.  He actually tanked me for it, so I've got to give it a thumbs up.
B00A0SJJUO|2.0|poor acting, okay fight scenes, all of the other Rocky's are better<br />does not measure up overall<br />Rocky 2 through 4 are better movies
B00AH8U3UC|5.0|I don't know why I love you so, but I do.  And Karen, you are perfection..I'm obsessed with you.  Please please please tell me that there's more.  I can't bear the way the season ended
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read each of the Jack Ryan novels now and hope there are more are still to come.  Keep them coming, Clancy!
B0026PW67W|5.0|A pretty cool if I do say so.  Bought this for a 9 year old potter fan who couldn't have been more pleased.
0307277887|3.0|It's too similar to the show to really be entertaining.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the show, and don't want to, buy this book. If you have seen the show, skip this book the show is better.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Why so many bad reviews? As a big fan of the first 3, I thought this movie was perfect. The writers did a remarkable job weaving both story lines together and making you actually care about the characters in one movie. Is Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) or is the director Tony Gilroy another Paul Greengrass? is this what you want - do you really need your camera shaking nausea back?<br /><br />If you like a well told story (having seen the other 3) and don't mind a little change and better camera work, this is a 5 star movie!<br /><br />The Treadstone and Black Briar back stories are expanded, the spy thrillers are connected what more do you want, except a sequel and continuing story lines.<br /><br />If you are longing for Matt Damon and Bourne 4, all I can say is that you must see this movie since the next one can only prove Bourne's Dominion.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The story never gets old. Unlike the movie, the singing is extraordinary. This may be the best cast to date.
0061743526|5.0|This book is wonderful no matter how many times you read it.  Fascinating people in a fascinating town, controversy, coming of age, etc. Beautiful storytelling.  Highly recommended!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A great novel, with a twist at the end. Couldnt work it out! Very readable, very human. It speaks of the hopelessness of many young people, even though they may have a &#34;good&#34; home
B007J4T2G8|5.0|it's a great book. Easy to read,and very addicted. I used the kindle app to read it and everything was good. The dictionary helps me a lot since English it's not my first language
B00AH6CCK8|1.0|I've loved Metallica since \\"Master of Puppets\\" was released. It was one of the very first tapes I ever bought and I still have that first cassette.<br /><br />The 'Black' album came out the same year I graduated from high school and since then I've been progressively more and more disappointed with everything Metallica has done.<br /><br />Numerous times in high school, my band geek metalhead friends and I would get high and eventually someone would say, \\"wouldn't it be awesome if...\\" or \\"they're totally classical, man\\" or \\"they should totally play with an orchestra\\"<br /><br />No. They shouldn't.<br /><br />Yes. Of course Metallica's first three albums have classical elements. That's what happens when your base player is classically trained and is arguably the best base player ever. But that doesn't necessarily mean an actual orchestra should play WITH Metallica while Metallica is ALSO playing Metallica.<br /><br />Hearing an orchestral interpretation of Metallica would be one thing but trying to listen to this album was painful. It was like I was listening to two different tracks at once and it just resulted in a headache and regret that I'd spent $15 bucks on something that was so poorly executed.<br /><br />The orchestra distracted from a good live Metallica show and because Metallica is who they are they drown out everything else around them.<br /><br />Don't they have friends who can say, \\"uh, Lars, James, that's a REALLY bad idea. Maybe we should work on this some more.\\" No they're rich, it's their music, and if they want to ruin it, that's their business.<br /><br />A great example of how this COULD have been done is what Apocalyptica did in '96. Their album \\"Plays Metallica by Four Cellos\\" is genuinely awesome. Four dudes. Clearly huge Metallica fans. Stripped down versions on cello with no stupid flowery accompaniment from violins or french horns or anything else stupid. Just awesome. And from Finland no less.<br /><br />In theory, Metallica could have done something similar. Instead they chose to play a gig with an orchestra.<br /><br />Bad. Just bad. And like virtually everything else they've released since '91, not worth my money.e something similar. Instead they chose to play a gig with an orchestra.<br /><br />Bad. Just bad. And like virtually everything else they've released since '91, not worth my money.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great new sequel to temple run it even has mine carts  zip lines and huge guerillas .it's awesome
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm having soooooooooo much fun with this.  buy this if you thought temple run was great but you felt it could've had a lot more.  this is ridiculously fun to play
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it was great at first now it wont even let me get on I will get to the add and then go back to the kindle home screen
B005I6EU7U|5.0|It has met all expectations, and I love how it makes the kindle look like a real book.  Worth it.
1423140605|4.0|I have read all his other books (as far as I know) and this one holds up nicely. It continues on with the story in a fun and interesting way.<br />I don't want to give anything away, so if you are a fan of Riordan's work, and have read his other books, I would recommend this.<br /><br />If you don't know his work, check out the Lightning Thief (the movie does not count) and decide if you are interested in Greek Mythology with a modern twist.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love games like this that make you think and use some strategy.  I have a lot of trouble sleeping and enjoy spending time late at night involved in solving puzzles such as this and playing games on my new Ipad.  I'm  new to the computer world but learning to love it more with each day (night).  Certainly a game worth the price (even if you had to pay for it!).
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This is a gr8 game, however on 2 kindle fires (original) we own, the game will terminate and then one is unable to continue. THE game has to be uninstalled & downloaded again, though this fix only works until the next termination. Software compliance clearly should be better.<br />i presume we are in the minority as most reviews seem highly positive, but  I write this comment for the benefit of other frustrated users.
B0093URN4E|1.0|I was eagerly expecting music, but was greeted with horrific screaming vocals and a teenager's notion of heavy guitar.  The niceties of melody or song development are absent. What a deep pleasure liberating my CD player of this disc turned out to be.
B001NLKT60|3.0|I loved the first two books of this trilogy, but found the third seeking, and failing, to break new ground. Salander takes on the attributes of 007, and too much of the book deals with the doings of the police. I'm glad I read all three, and this one is up to the general standard for detective stories. But books 1 and 2 were way higher than the standard, so &#34;The Girl Who Played With Fire&#34; was somewhat of a letdown, other than rounding out and finishing the story.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is the best movie and packages ever!!!! I love it! great price and great gift idea!  Strongly recommomend  to anyone.
B001E7EONC|3.0|This was a good movie, good dialog, good acting, suspence etc. What it isn't is an action movie, so if that is the main reason you want to watch it you will be disapointed.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Was a little disappointed in the story line and the character played by Josh Brolin. There was a lot of room for a more complex story as this was pretty predictable.
B0010T0OCY|4.0|The acting is good, the plot strange but interesting, all in all well worth watching at least once, and probably multiple times ( I bought the DVD).
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie was all hype. I wasn't too impressed with the acting or the story line. When you get past the credits and you see the clips from the Director, THOSE are what should have been in the first cut. It wasn't until I saw the tail end of those that I said, hmm, had they put that in there to begin with, it would have been an alright movie. You see supernatural guy in the beginning and the end. No story line for him at all. Wasn't a good movie in my opinion.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a page turner. I loved the twist at the end. I didn't want it to end. I also can't wait for the movie to come out!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have spent around the last year sleeping less than 8 hours of sleep each night. SO glad &quot;White Noise&quot; was the app of the day. Rainstorm, pink noise, and white noise are the best! My three year old and I fall asleep almost instantly when we turn any of the three on. I highly recommend this app to people with babies, fiddlers, or anyone who cant sleep.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, THINKING AND ORGANIZATION A MUST. AWSOME!!!! IT IS VERY ADDICTING IN A GOOD, FUN WAY!!! THANKS!!!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|The entire series of three movies is a timeless and classic story about friendship, trust, and love.<br /><br />It will forever be a favorite of families everywhere.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Could not stop reading it!  Lost sleep reading Kate I to the night<br /><br />It was a very gripping and also heartfelt story within a story!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I purchased Book 1 and loved it. This is book 2 which I was very excited to read. I began to understand the characters a little more. Read it quite quickly. I say for sure invest in all 3 books.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This film just won the Producers Guild Award, and there's no mystery as to why--it's one of the most rewarding experiences I've invested in myself in long, long time.  Highly recommended.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Fun entertaining movie with some blood. Sequel possibly???<br /><br />Although could be scary for little kids. New to Amazon video. Will definitely use again..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Recommended by my son-in-law, this game is addicting. If your an emotional player, beware when you start, but the more you play the more accustom you become and the funner it gets. Awesome game.
B009JZVT70|4.0|This show is fantastic. Truly. I can't wait for each new ep. But I must say, though it is still mid season, the show is just not as much ...well, fun, as the first season.<br /> Still, it is amazingly good.  Go Rumple!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Cast and special effects in this reboot of a scifi classic were phenomenal. However, it's basically the same story and same predictable outcome, so the movie wasn't as suspenseful as it could have been. Definitely a rental and not worth buying.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An amazing book that links to absolute perfection with Fall of Giants and keeps your interest to the point that you don't want to put it down until you've finished!!!  Can't wait for the next one!!!
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Definitely a new sound for them, but it works greatly. Just about on par with their other albums and worth listening to! Over time I can see this album growing on me even more, some really great tracks on here. Highly recommended!
030758836X|5.0|Having just finished this wild and crazy ride thru marital angst, deviousness, dark humor, and literary magic of nearly all types, it is impossible not to admire such a roller coaster novel which has just about anything a mystery fan of 2013 America would like! But really it's a lot more than another mystery. This book can be dopey, bizarre, outrageous, delirious, and plain zany. Set in real 21st century USA, it is not only the tale of a marriage gone way off the deep end; but a nation and society drowning in media excess, plundered by an economy nearly in the tank, a police system unbound, and characters walking a tightrope while staring right at the abyss. Scary but dizzy, with some of the weirdness you might find in Rabelais, or even deSade. Written in counterpoint, the first person timelimes of Nick and Amy, I admit even now it's tough to really follow what really happened; this may be the author's intent! Contrast  Twain's Tom Sawyer with DePalma/Hitchcock, you get an idea of this book. The author seems to zing right along the entire crazy ride, and probably had a great time thinking this weird tale through! And I cannot help but think \\"Amazing! What kind of a mind can conjure this yarn up?\\"  Probably has the makings of a sequel; since the end is about the only slight disappoint, and you can't help but wonder...\\"What happens after all this?\\"
B00B2V66VS|5.0|what a great game!!! I didn't think I would enjoy this game; but once I played it for the first time I was hooked.  I play it everyday.  it is a challenge.
0761169253|5.0|I really like this book! I'm not into self-help, but I found this inspirational. I wish I'd had this ten years ago. A lot of is was more basic than you'd need in your thirties, but I'd have loved this in my twenties, and I wish I'd had it then. :-)
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Downton Abbey is full of wonderful characters, good info on the class system of England or Europe in the early days and full of granduer and beauty besides interesting story lines. I can't wait to see all of the 3rd season.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I got the Trilogy a couple weeks ago and its over 1000 pages strong. Its such a great read that I just can't put it down. Watched the movie f the first book too and am pleasantly surprised that the film makers stuck to the book so closely. Hope they do it in the next two movies too.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that is amazing from start to finish, i will be listening to this one for years to come. I'm especially partial to the track &#34;Skinny Love&#34;, everyone should have this album.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Always a new turn just when you think you've figured it out. Can't wait to read the fourth book. A thrilling tale.
B00A0HQ7H8|3.0|I loved her first album, but was less than impressed with her follow up.  The songs seem to lack the emotion and depth of the first album and as my husband so eloquently put it &#34;she sounds like she's singing while drunkenly drowning&#34;
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|This movie is just plain fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously, the plot hangs together and moves along smartly, the characters are engaging (but you already knew that, if you're a Star Trek fan), and the ending is satisfying. What a fun ride! And free, too. I love good things that are free. Far too few of them in this life...
B005LF9OCE|5.0|fantastic series, that showcases not only the actor, but some fabulous writers as well.  I love the inside jokes and how they tie everything together.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|I worked for brokerage firms for a few years right out of college. This movie really captures the look, feel and thinking process of the big brokers. Well acted, with just enough technical detail to explain what's going on but not enough to confuse people. They don't go into how CDOs and credit default swaps based on financial plays - including no-doc, 120% loan-to-value mortgages granted to people who didn't have a prayer of repaying them - helped tank the economy in ways that are still destroying people's lives today. It's low-key, with a minimum of romantic, melodramatic b.s., which I appreciated. I liked this movie so much I broke down and bought the DVD before it became available to be streamed on Amazon Prime for free. This is a movie for people who don't consider thinking an onerous chore and who don't cherish any sentimental illusions about how money's made on Wall Street. I wish that category included a lot more people in this country; maybe then we'd elect fewer mush-brains to public office and have a stronger regulatory system for the financial services industry. We certainly need one.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The story of Alexander's experience after being in a coma was an interesting account on his part.  Did it offer &#34;proof&#34; of Heaven is something the reader will have to ascertain. I thought his story was something we could all read and wonder about in life and my thoughts of the proof of Heaven coincide with my own story and that is what I liked about his book.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book told the real story and I could not put it down. Everyone should get this book and read it. It tells how Osama was really killed when he peeped outside his door and was hit in the left eye and was flopping around on the floor and they put two more rounds in him.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this app is great!!!! does the job well .. only downsid  is the mute button. also th ability to skip an unlimited  amount of problems is a little counter productive. =)
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Zero Dark Thirty unveiled the intricate details behind the greatest manhunt of our generation in a masterly way. The movie follows Maya (Jessica Chastian), a young CIA agent as she devotes her career to gathering intelligence about al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden. She works with her fellow agent, Dan (Jason Clarke), to interview detainees with links to several Saudi terrorists. She witnesses torture, loses friends to suicide bombers, and sacrifices relationships in her devotion to find bin Ladin<br />Jessica Chastian's performance as Maya was strong and authentic. She maintained her femininity while being a no-nonsense bad ass with colorful vocabulary, and a complete disregard for anyone's approval of her. She played off this powerful role with an incredible subtlety that made her performance even more believable. Chastian was nominated for an Academy Award and won the Golden Globe for best actress.<br /><br />Jason Clarke's character, Dan, was extremely dynamic. He was feeding ice cream to a pet monkey in one scene and torturing detainees for information in the next. His character added depth to the movie as he symbolized the grey area in the hunt for bin Laden. He was one of the most likeable characters in the film, and yet also the most terrifying in the interrogation rooms. He gave the movie much-needed comic relief, and also revealed the realistic details of the hunt without euphemizations.<br />One of the most well done things about Zero Dark Thirty was its honest portrayal of events. What could have easily have been a simple patriotic film sodden in American values, was instead realistic and not romanticized. The movie showed the CIA's use of torture. It showed women and children being shot by our Navy on our behalf. These scenes enhanced the credibility of the movie.<br /><br />This nonromantic rendition of events also leads to an anticlimactic ending. It must have been difficult to build climax for an incident that is a part of history, but the lacklusterconclusion still threw me off guard.  It seemed the poignancy to the ending was not emphasized by the shooting, but actually by Maya's emotional reaction. After twelve years of dedicated work to this one case, she boards a plane by herself to return home successful.<br /><br />The movie was long. The scenes were intentional with every action and the dialogue was brief and complex. Because of this, it was a movie that required total immersion and concentration. It was also a movie with slow moving action, which made the minutes chug by slowly as well. While the extensive length added to the wealth and amount of details, it took away from the movie's entertainment value.<br /><br />Instead of leaving the theatre feeling patriotic, I felt drained, depressed, and sympathetic. After her work was over, Maya had no direction. Returning home, she didn't even know where the pilot should take her. The hunt for bin Laden consumed her life and once he was dead, she had nothing to live for.<br />The movie focused on the history and painstaking process to find bin Laden, but what made it impressive was Maya's firsthand account- her passion, her dedication, and her sacrifice.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Say what you want about the guy... he makes good movies.  I saw this in the theater and still shelled out for the DVD. Complicated plot, so you can watch it more than once and still enjoy, picking up things you missed the first time around.  Thumbs up!
B001EC2IXK|5.0|What We Got Here ,,Is Failure to Communicate.<br />Shaken it here Boss<br />Natural Born Would Shaker<br />I can eat 50 eggs in an hour ;)
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I think Guy R. is the most improved player amongst directors these days. This one was sweet. The first one was, too. Actors, sets, wardrobe, action and even the bad guys who are never right... very well done. Good job, Guy. Go for 3!
B004VMUS9G|3.0|The &#34;ringing&#34; tone I can sleep through it if not careful. And even if set to &#34;shake,&#34; I still have to turn it on to dismiss. On the plus side, it's fairly intuitive to set up--just don't use it as your primary alarm until you hear how it works in a real-life scenario.
B00846TTDG|3.0|Dude. You don't shoot a scene where the SEALS unload a boat mounted mini gun on a truck full of scumbags with ak-47s, only to go out of your way to film the baddies disembarking to safety only feet away... hiding in bushes. They'd be dead or half of them would. The boat infiltration with the guy in the suit was interesting. The sniper shots on the camp in the jungle was good, too. A little too chummy with the &#34;navy seal bros&#34; scenes on the beach. Three stars because I'm an American, darn it.
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|I thought it was really funny .<br />The part I loved the most was when they got stuck in the house and he started eating his candy doll.<br />The part I disliked was when they put up the Christmas Elf to scare him.<br />I would recommend this book to ages (8-13).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great story, characters and actors.<br />I can not get enough of Downton Abbey.<br />Loved Seasons 1 and 2, so far Season 3 is no exception
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Awesome book !I couldn't put it down! I want to read everything sparks has written. Can't wait to see the movie !
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Simple graphics. None of the levels are incredibly hard and some are throwaway easy. But overall it holds attention for a couple hours.
1616550414|5.0|This is the holy bible of the Zelda universe. Contained in this tome is concept art from the games, interviews, the official timeline of the games and more information than you could ever hope for. This is amazing as it gives us a whole new look at the franchise, we see from the concept art how the characters evolved and the production art is amazing.  While much of the book is given to talking about games like Skyward Sword and Twilight princess and the recent DS games, I will admit I wanted more discussion of Link's awakening and the Capcom co-produced game boy color games which were among my favorites. The discussion around Ocarina of Time is incredible and in fact all the interviews from those involved in the creation and production of the series are amazing. So much information is given about the games and this really feels worth the long wait. Especially the concept art as it lets us see how the character's looks evolved over time. You can really learn a lot about the characters and universe in this 276 page book.<br /><br />The info given also fills in on some of the backstory of the games, both in Universe and how they came to be. These interviews are excellent and Nintendo really goes all out to give you your money's worth!<br /><br />The timeline is something that has been long awaited by many fans but there is something you might be surprised by with it.<br /><br />As well there is 32 Pages of the skyward sword prequel comic included by the creators of the Zelda Manga and it is awesome. It fills us in on the backstory prior to Skyward Sword and the events mentioned in the game. A really fun comic, it also lets us know there are always more legends of Zelda and Adventures of Link.<br /><br />The book is in a Portrait format which means this is a coffee table book. The binding is awesome and the art looks like a visual feast for the eyes.<br /><br />While there isn't a lot of discussion on the earlier games, what there is is memorable and interesting. And if you are wondering, no the CD-i games are not mentioned thankfully.<br /><br />When this was announced in Japan for the 25th anniversary, fans in North America went nuts waiting for it to come and I can honestly say it was worth the wait. If you are a fan of the series, then you owe it to yourself to get this book. In many ways this is both the holy bible and the Holy Grail for Zelda fans.

B00A3DZ61W|5.0|It's great that the makers still re invent this simple yet clever game. This continues to freshen the brand and make people continue to play it.
1567184855|4.0|loved it. amazed at how much it has enhanced my faith !! I recomend this for all who have an intrest in a broad spiritual life.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Pointless. Good if u don't get bored easily. I would strongly recommend not getting the app. Wast of space for me.
B009APMNB0|4.0|PROS: Ease of use, runs smoothly and installs without errors on Windows.<br />CONS: Lack of brightness control which can be fixed using your DSLR camera as a lux meter and one of the many tutorials available on line.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Doesn't allow you to manually play like one would in real life. It's really frustrating, especially when challenge results are so arbitrary.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I think tr2 is not as good as the original temple run because the steering is harder and the screen  moves too much. But overall it is a decent game
B007EECSFA|4.0|An enjoyable story written in Morton's remembering the past-back to the present style.  World War II stories always fascinate me.
0345803485|3.0|Starts off slowly. A little difficult to believe. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. Too much of biting of her lip, hard thin pressed lips, her subconscious, &#34;holy crap&#34;... You get the picture

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|tHANKS for the product we will use it alot with our business.  thaks asgain and will order more in the future
0316056871|5.0|I found this to be very funny.  I agree it is a lot of snippets rather than something indepth but what a fun read!  She is a creative and talented person clearly.  It was easy to read and a great pick me up at a time that I needed a little laugh.  She was spot on about the mothering perspective.  It made me want to be her friend.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I think this is Stephen King's best novel yet and I highly recommend it. This one would make a great movie!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoy the Jack Reacher novels. If you enjoy mysteries you may like this series. The ultimate free spirit--go where you want,stay as long as you want, and solve the mystery.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Nothing spectacular, vintage John Grisham, which is pretty good. If you have read his other books, this one fits in the middle, not the best, but also not bad

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this app is great. As you move along it gets more challenging. It's a great time passer and I recommend it to anyone.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I thought the story drug at times, almost have to have read the previous book (I haven't) to follow the plot
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it's amazing with the corners and the new this and challenges this game rocks highly.recommend this game for young kids

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This second book to bared to you was amazing!! I completely loved it!! I can't wait for entwined with you to come out!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the perks of being a wallflower a few months ago, I was very impressed with the movie and even more impressed with the book. The way Charlie's letters are written is very relatable. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a \\"coming of age\\"  book without it being to cheesy.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It's not horrible, i'm not hard to please though. It was fine to watch, but really seeing the men was the real highlight and i'm not usually into that sort of thing. The acting wasn't bad either.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|The plot is quite far-fetched, but if you forget about that there is a lot of humor here for both kids and adults.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Good insight into history of period. Sort of a &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;plus working people view. Haven't finished it yet but plan to read the trilogy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was impressed with the story and character development. I read a lot and this one will definitely be remembered.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I ordered this set from Amazon and was very happy with how quickly it came.  The picture quality was much better than expected. I loved this series growing up and (interesting enough) it stands up to the test of time much better than most detective series. I liked the format of the show as it was different from other murder mysteries on TV at that time.  In Columbo you see the murder happen and know who the killer is and how they commited the murder from the start.  The switch from other shows is that you dont know how Columbo is going to solve it till the end when he pulls off some trick to solve it.  Very Agatha Christie like. There is always a little cat and mouse game between Columbo and the killer that keeps the episodes moving quickly. The very best part is the guest stars.  They are always excellent character actors that bring the murderers to life.  Wonderful to watch again! The only let down is that there is no episode list in the set.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game was a lot better than the original and if anyone says otherwise is kidding themselves.
B00A7CF1QY|2.0|The trailers made it look like it would be exciting and a fun move to watch, but it wasn't, the first 3 were much better and I can watch them over and over, this is a one and done !
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game. Though I think it is way easier then the first one. My biggest issue that I have is when I go to use the green gems to resurrect and it freezes and kicks me out. I lose the gem I was trying to use and the score and coins I picked up. Other then that this game is SO FUN. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants some mindless fun.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Excellent read<br /><br />Recommended for all Connelly fans. Fantastic build up through the book. On par or better than his others
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It makes me kinda dizzy and I like the first better. I have the graphics on low and its still weird looking.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This movie had real promise as a prequel to the Alien movie series.  Unfortunately, the script was subpar, and the acting to go along with it (to be expected from a space sci-fi, I guess).  But the worst part about the movie is how much stuff goes unexplained.  Why does the robot guy act the way he does?  What's the relationship between the multiple alien species?  Why would all these people take a 2 1/2 year trip into space without knowing why they were going?  Perhaps many of these questions get answered in the follow up movie that seems to be set up at the end.  But I think a better job of explaining at least some of it could have been done.  I gave it 3 stars simply because it was moderately entertaining, but I'd probably go with 2 1/2 stars if I could.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you love Pride and Prejudice and are a fan of Kate Morton's books I think you will love this series.Set in the 1920s Downton Abbey captures the essence of that time period in England. The lives of the rich intertwine with the lives of the servants in a natural way. The characters will capture your heart and make you fall in love and there are a few that you will despise. This is a great show!
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|When Walter White went from teacher to criminal in earlier seasons, you almost rooted for him to make it. He does not need our encouragement in season 4.
B0065GC0BA|3.0|Unbelievable, deeply emotional, will make you cry, but the sentiment seems shallow. I did feel for the plight of the lovely young man trapped in a life he did not choose, or was not born to. I also felt deep sympathy for his family. However, I did not buy the reliance of the family on a young girl to resolve the difficult choice made, I certainly could not see it happening in my family.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Paul Tough wrote interesting and persuasive stories about children who developed character. He presents good sociological points, but do not confuse it with a parenting book.

B008WCP2PG|4.0|Not the greatest story line here but still a fun movie to watch. Plus, who doesn't want to see Channing Tatum strut his fine self....
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The game makes you CARE about the characters. I am getting upset thinking that it is almost over... and I will have to leave my friends in the Persona universe... It's slightly depressing when a game is SO good you are depressed that it will be ending soon, at 100 hours you know it's almost over, so I can only recommend this game with the highest regard.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Kind Regards,<br /><br />Jonathan Bobal - Piano Teacher
B005LAIH4A|3.0|I thought this would be a good kid movie so I purchased it during the after Thanksgiving deals. The DVD was fine, the movie itself was kind of lame. The only part that stands out is the beginning of the movie with the singing and that's about it...Would rethink before buying this, and glad I didn't purchase on bluray.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an amazing game. I felt a bit iffy when I first saw it. I didn't know if it would be the exact game but with more goals to complete. However I began playing it and so far it is still exciting not just because you run but because you can ride on a train cart! So not only is it free but its fun and it doesn't force you into buying coins or anything else in order to advance like most of the free games do.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Love this movie, I'm not sure that the blu-ray version makes much difference. Still kind of a grainy, early 90's movie. Definitely one of those I have to watch over and over during the Holidays!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved this game! I thought it was so much more detailed than the original Temple Run and that made it really fun to play! I also loved discovering the mine cart part of the game.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its really fun. I enjoy finding the hidden. I thought it would be more like the game Clue, but this is fun as well.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie has a good plot and is fun to sing with and dance to.  Great to have for movie night.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really great book, especially for high school kids.  I loved this book...very inspirational to people who are going through tough situations in their life.....show you that no matter what, things get better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was just a preview of Season 3. But, I'm hooked on the series. Well done, good contrast of social classes, not predictable.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I enjoyed the book but was disappointed by the quickness of the read, especially the 12 dollar price.  I finished it in 8 hours.  I don't think I'd pay $1.50 an hour to read this.  That being said, the author did take the story in many interesting direction which showed a lot of imagination.  I didn't enjoy the 1st person perspective without the qoutes and descriptions of the characters as they interacted.  But I feel this is a common flaw about e-books.  Authors write these stories with having alot of dialog or descriptions of the interaction between the characters.  I found a lot of space was sucked up by the narrator's dialog which was sized about two levels larger than the people being interviewed.  It wasted a lot of space. The book is no better than a 6 buck e-book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story that keeps your attention the entire time!! Action, suspense, and love. Great visuals while reading that make you feel like you are there.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|I have enjoyoed this sequal to the series it was nice to knwo whow the story finally ended and that everyone was happy.  Its a great fantasy novel both for young and old.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book! It is so funny and at my school there are like 70 holds on the dang dang so yo should get out know you will like it! :)
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|The surround sound has has brought even more life to the masterpiece. The comic book helps bring in the thoughts from he times into a new reality. Crank it up!
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling has done it again.  Enjoyed the book! Slow start but worth reading.... I became hooked and just couldn't put it down. Found myself laughing at small town gossip and crying for the sadness of the truth. Look forward to more books by this author.
B004X1WUQ4|5.0|This book influenced a whole generation of economists and policy makers. It is still very relevant.<br /><br />Everyone today has been affected by the policies which have been implemented as a result of the work, and few great economists have not read and studied it. It is a book for professionals an certainly not for the general reader.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps you interested. I'd recommend it. The characters and curiosity pull you in to the story. You want to keep reading to find out what happens.
0385535147|5.0|I have read every John Grisham book and love them all he is my favorite author.  I have a collection of his books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I personally think that Temple Run 2 is WAY better than Temple Run 1. It feels more realistic and more daring moves. Yeah, so, it doesn't have that many characters as the first one but you can earn gems. One more thing than the other Temple Run. It's harder and gives players a challenge. I love the new Temple Run!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Started to listen to Joe since he played in Bloodline and have every compact disc he has ever put out.There has never been a bad one, so you pretty much know how I feel about this one.Believe me it will not disappoint.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Really enjoyed this film. I liked it better than the original. Karl Urban carried a lot of presence into the film, much more so than stallone did. I found him much more intimidating than the original dredd. I was afraid that this remake wouldn't be comparable to the original, but I have to say this one was much more enjoyable. There were a few parts that were predictable, but you get that with most films. Overall this rated a very solid 4.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is fabulous and addictive. My husband was so jealous of the book because I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to start the next.
B004Q7CIFI|2.0|This book was recommended so I bought it without reading the ratings.  I usually read the free or cheap books but I paid more for this book than any I've read.  Wasted my money.  I tried and then decided why should I spend my time reading something I had to force myself to read even if it was a famous author!
B005P39GOI|5.0|A folky-sounding band with some strong lyrics and varied music. I am really looking to see them delve into some heavier rock and other styles of music because these guys (and girl) are bursting with talent.
B008NW67E0|2.0|Bought this because of one song we heard on Saturday Night Live.  Upon hearing the rest of the songs on the album, we've decided the lyrics are pretty trivial and almost every song is the same.--starts slowly, bulds to a loud and fast crescendo.  They have a good sound, but they need better lyrics!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince always keep the story going, plenty of information on how the mission is to go and updates the problems and results of the mission right up to the end.  Makes me keeping for anything new from Vince.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Love it! I have watched it many many many times! I love the phantom!! My fave character! This is a beautiful storyline to continue Christine's and the Phantom's love story. :)
1936608898|4.0|I still can't fairly judge results because I have not started the 30 challenge, but from what I'm reading I think the book is on point  in terms of nutrition.  I have the say the science-y part is a bit of a challenge and if I hadn't had a course of two in A&P it would be completely over my head, but the Hartwig have my attention, and I'm looking forward to starting my challenge soon.  I'm still reading...
B008KEQMDC|5.0|This movie was great in theaters. My sister really wanted this so I couldn't wait to get it for her. She absolutely loves it.
0345803493|5.0|There was no way I could go on without reading this book...am ready to move on to the next book.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is a great album. It has a nice folk rock feel. The only thing that I found a little lacking was the instrumentation. At points the songs could have done with a little more guitar and bass and a little less vocals. Overall it was amazing though.
0345803507|5.0|I bought this book because the first two were awesome...wish it didnt have to end...would love it if she could continue with the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first but the book was better! I can't wait to read the second one and see the next movie
0345803485|5.0|This book is awesome. E L James is an amazing author. I recommended this book to everyone, male and female.
B000FC10WU|4.0|This is a typical Agatha Christie. It had suspense and was interesting reading. The characters were unusual with special traits that intrigued me.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Loved the book, Nelson DeMille is my favorite author. Wish he would write more books, one every two years is hard to wait for. Keep up the great works.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|lots of fun so far. just learning.would like to see more options in horse's available for purchase ..unicorns? really? with more to leearn its a fun game.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Well, that kinda says it all, eh?<br /><br />Lots of fun.  Cleaver puzzles as well as cleaver theme.<br /><br />Try it...It's fun!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I like this app alot, except I am currently under a tornado watch (not warning) and there is no notice that I can find, also the wind speed does not show the gust mph.  I like VERY much that it is live info and the single screen info.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm so glad this book exists. That is really all I have to say about it. Read it for yourself.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Haven't had the much with a phone application since the first one . The new twists a.d turns.will have you wanting to keep playing forever .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is even better than the original. They have added so many new power-ups and have taken out the useless ones.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Its a great coming of age story-had story lines I could relate to!! Being in high school is difficult for everyone in some aspects this book makes u realize ur not the only one that went through rough times.
B0091REZMW|5.0|One of the best hidden objects games I have played. The graphics are great. I really enjoy this app and its free.
B005K15XR4|5.0|High energy instrumentals, excellent exercise music or if you just need something to get you moving.  This is the best of the three TSFH discs available from Amazon but the margin is very close.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is a great game you should try it out it is hard to move up but eventually you'll get past it .... try it out it is worth the time!!! (^&deg;o&deg;^)
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|This music will make you want to grab an axe and charge some orcs!  High energy epic instrumental.  That pretty much sums it up.  Of the three TSFH discs available on Amazon this one is the weakest but that isn't really saying much.  All three discs are extremely good so it's like picking between three bottles of very good bourbon.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Awesome graphics! This game was fun and addicting! Just what I was looking for!<br />I've I started I just couldn't pull myself away.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|My hunger to know the outcome of the story almost as strong as the desire in Peeta to be a part of life with Katniss. I was obsessive, reading all three books in little more  than a week. It has been a very long time since  I have been so engrossed in a book. Oh and thank you for a somewhat predictable ending, I needed it after feeling so drained by the turmoil in these young lives. I can't wait for the movies to come out and I hope that books 2 & 3 are followed as closely as 1 was.
B00846REIS|4.0|ONE of the best reads ever! So much more of a story line than Fifty Shades, I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's a great tool to meet new friends, find old friends and stay in touch with everyone. It's definitely much better than the old 'my space' which got to be way to raunchy for me. i like FB b/c it links with other media like Pinterest.
B008NAFU9A|3.0|The story is decent.  At times I thought it might need to be longer as I think a little more character development is needed.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|what's there not to like, love and want to buy! it's easy to use & you can create your own account and make tweak it too.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I like how just how much battery life is left, where the most power is being used, when charging goes into fast charge mode up to 80% and tells you how long before it is fully charged.<br /><br />Great product. No Ads
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Here is my advice for enjoying this book: skip all the Daenerys chapters in the first half of the book. You won't miss much because nothing much happens except (not really a spoiler) she is indecisive about her reign as queen for chapter after chapter after chapter. Once the Tyrion storyline gets to Mereen, start reading the Daenerys chapters, because they pick up a bit. The sections about Jon Snow and the Wall suffer from some of the same lack of forward movement. If you are a fan of the Arya storyline, as I am, you'll be disappointed; there's not much here, though what is here is good. The best storyline is probably Tyrion's (he never disappoints) and the chapters about the Greyjoy siblings and the fate of Winterfell are a pleasant surprise; I found them boring in past books but they are far more interesting this time around.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|OMG!  I loved it!  Steamy and loving all at the same time!  One of my faves.  The trilogy is a must!
B009MO5960|4.0|I really liked it, as the rest of the series, not much of a story, but the action makes up for it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|sometimes i fear this.  I worry about Big Brother always watching us even in our private home.  But I did connect with family I have not spoken to for years which is fablous
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|I have been a fan of this show since Sci Fi (screw the new spelling!) first aired it. I bought both seasons to date and when the third comes out I will buy it too. Love the characters and stories. I'm a huge fantasy fan and this show fills the bill. I highly recommend this show to all my fellow fantasy buffs.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Seriously, there have been several posts calling this film \\"an underground masterpiece\\" and a \\"cult classic\\". I appreciate those who have been jonesin' for a hot action sci-fi flick - the last 'great' one that I can think of being the first Matrix - but this uber-violent, underwhelming spectacle is just a bloody mess. If the director and production team spent half as much energy on atmosphere, pacing, or acting as they did on glorifying slow-motion blood splatter then those 4 and 5 star ratings might be justified.<br /><br />(Currently I am trying to figure out if this tops the 1990's Stallone stick-bomb)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is my six year olds favorite game.I like the new twist and turns.the graphics are awsome. You get lost in time playing this.great game!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This writer is tasteful in her words and very talented.  Cannot wait to read more of her work! love it
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fantastic game overall. Beautiful graphics, fun variety of puzzles. My young son and I were both entertained for hours. Well worth the money!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I did not want it to end.  I have read all three books!  Love, Love Loved them.  She needs to write more!
B002BI6SMI|2.0|I expected something better than the first part,but is just worse.<br />I feel sorry for the US EMBASSY because this movie make the security<br />look like S........<br />  THAN YOU.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|How can I ever read another book!  This series needs to go on and on and on.  I loved the ending, but wanting more!
B003YJEXL6|5.0|This book will change your perspective on so many issues regarding gender discrepancies, especially those perpetuated by science.  I'm reading it for a philosophy course, but it could apply to almost any course.  I've already recommended it to several people!
B00846REIS|5.0|These books are amazing.  I have read the first two in this series and I cannot wait until May so I can read the third.  Very tastefu!
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Great for  your body it's a bit hard at first but th  more you do it the better you great AWESOME work out even for younger kids like 9 and up :):):):):)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was awesome.  Book one keeps you wanting more and book two and three are the same way.  Cannot wait to see what she comes up with next.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a good app but I couldn't get it in my church. It requires WiFi. It kinda stinks. But when I am home it is a great app. It.has devotionals, highlights and all it takes is to create a new profile on the Bible
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better than the first and amazeball graphics<br />I love it<br />love it<br />LOVE IT<br />hope theres a three<br />because this is absolutely amazeballs

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is da bomb. I loveee it. It is better than the first one. Of course that was their goal, but they pasted their goal. Likee i said I LOVEE IT. It has a great view on my Kindle Fire.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Quick, fast, gives a nice display. Just like being on a computer. Easy to navigate and find whatever I'm looking for.
B004HAG40O|5.0|The King is Dead is the album of the year in my book, the tortured lyrics and melodious instrumentals make my life complete.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|All I can say is look out below and enjoy the ride. The graphics are great and the fun will last for hours.
B003PM5Y4M|5.0|The movie is really fun and funny. Even having seen this movie already I still had a great time watching it again! It was especially fun watching my friend's face as the story unfolded and the crazy quirks of the characters were revealed.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I already bought this game but when I try to install it it keeps getting errors I am going to file a complaint because this is ridiculous.
B008M9PHWM|5.0|I love this album. Bob is the man! If you havent gotten this album yet, do it now! Highly recommend.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|this is the most famous Michael Jackson record.  If you are a dancer, it will bring you to life!  Get up off the couches all you potato people and dance to this record!  You'll live longer and feel great.
B004LW8C0I|1.0|Couldn't watch the much anticipated movie as it came in English packaging but dubbed in another language.  Bitterly disappointed by being &#34;had.&#34;
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I really like this album with the exception of the title track (well it's not the title, but it's the gorilla song).  That one is just too negative and nasty. But the rest has those wonderful rhythms, top notch production, and great energy of this young artist.  Recommend with the one caveat.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|1st time user & I love it...first night I spent a solid hour fooling around w/ the effects & looking at tutorials. I got this app just to crop & do basic edits to photos, this is so much more!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It's a great game .my favorite season is Halloween a lot of difficult Levels in that season . Also liked the valentines season with the falling hearts
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I was completely surprised by this book, I didn't expect it to be this good at all.  I had never heard of Anthony Ryan, who is he anyway?  I'll tell you who he is, a fantastic author that's going to be writing the classic stories on which I'll be fondly thinking when I'm on my death bed.<br />Read this book now.  Read his short stories too.  The sequel to this book is coming out soon, read this one before it does.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is so addictive and so much fun. So many new things, a lot more fun than the first one. It's free too!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game keeps you moving! It takes a lot of attention and very active game. Very cool graphics and the scenery is cool. It keeps you interested in the game.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Very happy with this case.  The case is thin enough and the screen protector has prevented many scratches.  I would buy it again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is SOOOOO FUN!!! I'm SO very happy that it is free!!! But like i said, it is very, very, VERY... ADDICTING!!!! :) Great wat to pass time too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|highly recommend this app! Has lots of plans to choose from, for devotional reading to verse memorization . . .
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I think Renner is very good in this, and that it fits very well into the franchise. I'd recommend it
B008C40218|4.0|I've owned this album since it was released 4+ months ago, and it has grown on me quite a bit. I've become a huge Calexico fan the past 5 or so years, and in general this album won't disappoint those that are happy with where Calexico is at.<br /><br />For those that wish Calexico would go somewhere different, they show hints at it.  I think it begins with recording this album in New Orleans and titling it after the studio they used.  There are subtle hints at that move, but probably not enough to call this album a departure for the band.  In general, Calexico is still Calexico here.  It is a solid album, and it starts off beautifully.  The first 3 tracks are fantastic tracks reminiscent of the finest on any of the previous Calexico albums.  They continue with their Southwestern sound, but it is the slight variations like Sinner in the Sea that end up as highlights on this album.<br /><br />I point out that song because it is where the use of organs as an instrument (the most obvious New Orleans influence) shows up, and it adds a tension that really makes the song shine.  I also like the somewhat obvious reference to the Doors that comes through in the track at its tensest moment.  It makes the song a 5 star track.  If the rest of the album had showcased such performances and the organ more, it would be a 5 star album.  Instead, after the track (starting at the song Para), you get Calexico moving into its comfort zone, which isn't all bad.  The songs are beautiful in their own right.  The album just unfortunately feels like a tease with the initial 3 tracks, and I wish the momentum and organ influence would have continued.<br /><br />I don't mind the evolution of a band, and Calexico does hint at it.  I see some critics panning the album because of a lack of change, but it isn't that bad.  Taken alone, the album is good.  It's definitely 4 stars.  It isn't an album I'd reference to my friends who want to listen to the band I've been bragging about for the last few years and has become one of my favorites.  I'd still steer them towards Carried to Dust or The Black Light (5 star albums for sure).  Never-the-less, this album is not something I'd discourage anyone from.  4-stars is not bad.ears and has become one of my favorites.  I'd still steer them towards Carried to Dust or The Black Light (5 star albums for sure).  Never-the-less, this album is not something I'd discourage anyone from.  4-stars is not bad.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love  this app.It makes me want to read the bible more.It is easy to use and a great way to find peace in this world.I feel closer to the Lord.
B007SGM084|3.0|The writing is pretty bad and the language she uses is a little off sometimes. It's supposed to be set in Seattle and the main character is supposed to be 21, but some of the things that Ana says are not things a 21 year old American girl would say. The characters start getting annoying after a while, but that just might be me. I would have given it 2 stars but hey I'm almost done with the third book, so EL James must have done something right.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The only thing better than the tv show is the book. I admit the tv show introduced me to this book and I'm so glad it did!!! So many new characters and links are created in this book that the tv show completely misses. The book really draws you in and you can feel the characters pain.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I bought and read all the books in this series. I find with most theologies the first is always the best the second is the filler story and the third is good but in no way comparable to the first. I will have to firmly disagree with my own thinking. I could not put this book down. It is unfathomable what Katniss and Peers had to go through and UNBELIEVEABLE how it ends. By far this is a wonderful book. And I cannot wait for the 2 and 3 movies ;)
B005LAIGSM|3.0|I love the Sparks novels and their movie adaptations, but this one just didn't hit it for me... and that's coming from someone who adores Rachel McAdams.  Still, not a total waste of time if you enjoy this genre.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I know you will love this game. I love this Game I think it s awesome. You will love this game I'm sure of it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love love love Pinterest.  It is my go to for everything that I love !  Patterns, recipes or even cartoons that make me smile.  Please never take my Pintetest away from me  !!!!!
1612680011|4.0|Good and interesting book. Not that I agree with everything it says, and nevertheless it misses a key point: where do you get the money to start with!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The series is well written and acted.  I love Maggie Smith!  The home is beautiful and the scenery wonderful.  The story line tranisitions well and it keeps one wanting to see what is going to happen next.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again, I couldn't put the book down!!! I am on pins and needles to read the third book!!! Thank you E L James :)
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It read like a young teen novel with sex scenes, which is not what I expected. It was a little too mushy and teen-obsessed-with-the-mysterious-guy. Slightly redeemed itself at the end.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed the game, it could've been a little bit longer. But other than that it was a fun game.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I had realized there was something in bread that made me ill...however i didnt think it was &#34;gluten&#34; per se. This book really clarifies the problem and if i adhere to the principal i feel great.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this game is the most boring and useless price of crape amazon ever put on the store. I don't understand how anyone can play this whit without throwing up.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|i love the selection it has all the nearby stations that i listen to without the annoying static and lost signal. i have had  no problems with this app.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you can't get enough of Sylvia Days' Bared in You, follow along in this second book of her trilogy.  A great read guaranteed to keep you turning pages long into the night, while steaming up you glasses. : )
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Have this on my ipod...so much better bigger.  Just like owning one without the smell. :D Great for all ages.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This copy came through safely and speedily and in good condition.  I recommend this to any Jane Austen or classics fan.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|It is not as interesting as it was in Season 2. The story line is not as good. I loved Season 1 and 2. Season 3 not as much.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Proof of Heaven.<br />Especially as it was written by an individual that has the medical training; 180 degree difference than the spiritual woo-woo mindset that many of us share.<br />For those that need the scientific/medical analysis of such a heaven experience, here it is.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|This cover could only be better if it had a place to store a stylus or an ear phone.  The stand works well over my knees, or on the counter top.
B0076NKLRQ|2.0|\\"She's the greatest piece of ass on earth. With tits like that, you make allowances.\\" This crude logic proffered by Marilyn Monroe's (Michele Williams) publicist Arthur Jacobs (Toby Jones) sums up how much talent it takes to forge an acting career in Hollywood provided that you've got the right package of bodily goods to ware. Let's admit it: Marilyn probably didn't get her famous role in Some Like It Hot because of her ability to re-create a character; rather, it was one more fulfillment of the persona Hollywood had created for her: that of a coquette who could get leering men hot in the pants by making kissing gestures at them with her forefinger and doing a little bunny-hop dance number. Shallow? Sure. As the old saying goes, sex sells. Sadly, such shallowness also sums up Simon Curtis's My Week With Marilyn, a film that I'd expected much more from.<br /><br />Despite Williams's captivating and sympathetic performance as Marilyn, the film rambles and lectures, telling us little to nothing we didn't already know. It pretends to focus on a young starstruck university graduate and aspiring film-maker, Colin Clarke (Eddie Redmayne), and the halcyon time he spends with the most celebrated female sex symbol in movie history. Instead, we get a yawnworthy biopic that predictably shines the spotlight on the prima donna. We see Marilyn in all her forms: the consummate cocktease; the frazzled, incoherent druggie; the neurotic, insecure, catatonic mess; the unexpectedly intelligent woman who reads Joyce and Dostoevsky in her free time. In other words, we find out little more than we could have looked up in an encyclopedia or seen on a television retrospective. A good biopic should have more insight than that.<br /><br />Yet I think the film is indeed clumsily trying to do more than that. Depicting Marilyn's performance in an English movie, The Prince and the Showgirl, as she stars alongside the movie's director Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), it makes a heavy-handed contrast between the British and American schools of acting. Olivier, portrayed as an unrelenting taskmaster by Branagh, castigates Marilyn for her constant tardiness, breakings-down during rehearsals, and inability to understand her character. He discovers that Marilyn can only method-act in a role she's typecast for; she falls apart when she has to step into an unfamiliar character's shoes. She's a big star but not professionally trained and probably not natively gifted enough to compete with even the lowliest British character actor.<br /><br />Ironically, though, in My Week With Marilyn the British fall prey to the same hero worship of celebrities. The film's ponderous message boils down to little more than a simplistic observation of humanity's infatuation with stardom. Colin becomes so besotted with Marilyn that he breaks up his down-to earth relationship with Lucy (Emma Watson), the wardrobe assistant he's dating, in the laughably quixotic hope that Marilyn might forget her status as a famous personality and have a fling with a nobody. A co-actor, crone Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench), builds up Marilyn's self-esteem, telling her that she can be a great actress despite her erratic behavior and incompetence. Even Olivier, despite growling that \\"trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like trying to teach Urdu to a badger,\\" is completely transfixed by her screen presence, even in her most fumbling and embarrassing moments.<br /><br />I, too, find her irresistible, but I'd chalk that up to my weakness as a typical lustful, cleavage-loving male. Vicariously living through a star is not my idea of a fulfilling life. Truth be told, Marilyn didn't want to be Marilyn either. \\"I just wanted to be loved like a regular girl,\\" she tells Colin in one of the film's more poignant moments. Unfortunately, the film never really delves deeper into Marilyn's emotional conflict or her apparent resentment at being manipulated by the movie establishment. We never get more than a superficialglimpse into what made Marilyn the person tick.<br /><br />If I have neglected to give poor Colin his due, it's because the film practically forgets about his troubles after his opening voiceover, in which he informs us that his family considers him a failure and doesn't approve of what they perceive as his frivolous career choice. It could have made for some interesting storytelling to explore his struggles alongside Marilyn's by showing us what they learn about themselves during their time together. It could have made their relationship seem plausible despite the very different worlds they come from. They've both pushed themselves into a career in the movies to try to conquer their nagging self-doubt.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Does the job! I thought I had lost my original that came with my Kindle when I first ordered it. Then found it the same day as my new USB cable arrived, so glad to have two of them now.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Awesome and more awesome.  Good music and production. seems like the good ones have there lives cut short to often.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very entertaining. The book was difficult to put down and I will definitely read other books by this author. Recommend
B007I0RA26|5.0|I have been wanting to read this book for quite some time...couldn't put it down when I started.  Thank you!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I originally was introduced to the music of Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr at Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, TN.  I immediately realized how incredibly talented singers and writers they were.  When I learned later that year that they would be forming a group with the legendary Kenny Loggins, I was stoked.  I caught their first gig at Tin Pan South, and have been eagerly anticipating the release of their debut album.  Needless to say, I am not disappointed.  There is no dominant voice other than Blue Sky Riders.  They play off of each other with such great harmonies it is easy to just listen to the album over and over again for hours.<br /><br />Of particular note to me are the titular track \\"I'm a Rider (Finally Home) which perfectly shows the blend of their three voices, \\"Little Victories\\" which showcases the amazing voice of Georgia Middleman, the tender \\"Another Spring\\" speaking of rebirth, and my personal favorite, \\"A Thousand Wild Horses\\" which I am amazed was never bought and recorded by another artist before Gary was finally able to record this with Blue Sky Riders.  All I can say is, it was the perfect timing for its production, with this group and these amazing artists.<br /><br />If anyone out there is looking for an album that will be a favorite in your collection for years to come, you have found that album in \\"Finally Home.\\"<br /><br />Here's hoping for continued success and outstanding albums from Georgia, Gary, and Kenny.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I really enjoy playing the My Little Pony game both myself and with my daughter, but to accomplish many of the missions you have to wait around a lot for bits or gems (which you can purchase but are expensive and personally I don't see why you would have to do so in order to play the game).  Also, it will not allow me to connect via facebook or gameloft to search for friends.  Fun if you want something leisurely to do while on the tablet, but can be discouraging because you end up having to pay for things on a &#34;free&#34; game.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie was pretty good, there wasn't much of a plot, but the characters were funny and the movie was a good rental.  I would recommend it to a friend.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I love this series and wanted to share it with friends and family.  I purchased it and the 2nd season together and so got a great price.  This arrived quickly and in perfect condition, I couldn't ask for more, thanks Amazon ;?D
1616550414|5.0|I received this book yesterday and was very impressed. I'd say the book exceeded my expectations. The cover looks and feels very nice, and the book is much larger and heavier than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. The pages are very nice as well. There was nothing about the aesthetics I was disappointed about.<br /><br />The book is full of Zelda concept art and illustrations. These are all wonderful and look beautiful in the book. Along with that, there is an official timeline, information about every game released, and information about the series in general. There's even a manga included. The book is very detailed and of very high quality. You're definitely getting your money's worth with all of the content included in the book.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough to a Zelda fan. The book actually exceeded my expectations, and I was very, very pleased as a huge Zelda fan. Get this book, you won't be disappointed.
B004VOBIE8|3.0|A little disappointed. Not much different than the one that came with my phone. Thought I could do more with it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It has been a long time since I have watched anything that I have enjoyed this much !  I was hooked with the first episode and each one has been wonderful.  The characters, costumes and scenery are perfect.  I look forward to each episode.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|The story shows that even in the evil of Hitler's wars there was human compassion and wars are often forced upon<br />good people who would never do the things forced upon them by evil rulers. A warning to all people that one man<br />voted in power can cause untold misery.

B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Her previous movies were better. This one seemed like an after thought and of course they leave it open for another movie to end all movies.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I've loved this series from the very beginning with the Lightning Thief (I'm an old person...so take my review with a grain of salt)<br /><br />This was a good book, some great new characters/gods/monsters are introduced. Fun story. We were on vacation and I got to spend a couple of days getting caught up with Percy and the gang.<br /><br />What struck me was the various points of view. There seemed to be more in this book than the others. From Percy's, Annabelle, Frank, Hazel on and on. While Mr. Riordan utilizes this style in all of his books. There was something cumbersome in it's use this time.<br /><br />The other thing was that this book left me feeling the same that I did after reading Half Blood Prince.  Stuck.<br /><br />This is just the  middle of a bigger story. So standing alone, this wouldn't be that good of a book. If you didn't understand the characters, back story or story arc. This book wouldn't be of any interest to anyone. (Trust me..I get it...and frankly from a business perspective it's brilliant. We have to keep buying books or we will lose out of the story.) This just wasn't the BEST.<br /><br />But that said. You have to read it. This is part of the story. Don't get left out. There is important back story to characters here.<br /><br />I'm not a professional reviewer of books. Just a reader. Of Mr. Riordan and his work, easily I'm a fan.  I will keep reading his work...of course...we are in the middle of a story here...so I'm looking forward to the next book in the series.  Hurry.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I really liked the time keeper, because it held in its simplicity many overlooked life lessons. Some of the ideas and characters conveyed in this book moved me and opened up my eyes to some of the things we take for granted.<br /><br />It is a short and quick read... I am sure you will enjoy it!
1594202842|5.0|This book was the topic of several fiery lunch conversations at work. My coworkers, like most readers, were polarized. They either violently hated it or loved it. I was intrigued. So I read it and found myself in the later group. There are many laugh-out-loud parts, I couldn't put the book down!<br /><br />One part that struck a chord with me, was the idea of \\"Generational Decline\\"-- the Chinese proverb \\"prosperity can never last for three generations.\\" I see this cyclical phenomena all the time, this is a good label for it. At the university, immigrants strive to be the BEST because they MUST, to be picked for few opportunities to leave their country for a better life. They achieve wealth in the US. Then their kids, are often also successful, with finer things and higher social circles. However, if their kids are born into luxury are too pampered, many are lazy, dependent. They are not equipped with the character to maintain this standard of living. There is decline, until their progeny gets motivated to find success again. As a parent, I share Chua's goal to develop the character of my children to make sure they have what it takes to succeed in whatever they choose in life.<br /><br />What makes this book great is that Chua is not PC and is willing to be brutally honest about her parenting style, one that is almost blasphemous to American standards -- a brute-force Chinese parenting method. After dealing with kids/adults with no discipline, direction, and spoiled, it is actually refreshing to see someone teach her kids right from wrong, the value of hard work, and make them be upstanding members of the community.<br /><br />I don't agree with all of Chua's parenting methods, but I admire greatly her bigger vision of wanting her kids to have the character to be successful. That is no small task. You're never perfect as a parent, but if your kids are responsible, contributing people, I think you've done your job right. It is so easy to criticize her methods; just asit's easy to let your kids do whatever they like. After seeing so many rich kids with every opportunity only live for material possessions, I admire greatly wealthy parents who instead focus to spend their money on education and teach their kids to be contributing members of society.<br /><br />An inspiring story. I would much rather see more Tiger moms any day.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|This movie belongs in the 50's.<br /><br />C'mon we live in 2013! Who enjoys musicals with a bunch of actors/actresses looking at the mirror and sobbing? Especially ones that dont have ANY normal dialogue throughout the movie without singing it!<br /><br />The world is a place where people need instant gratification, by a story which talks to people through its idea. I walked out of Les Miserables and went to Silver Linings Playbook in the theater next door. Best move ever!<br /><br />Those of you that want to watch a movie about people struggling with their issues will definitely be satisfied in Silver Linings Playbook. Simple story of a guy who is manic on pursuing the wrong thing for himself thinking that it will make him happier, when the solution is in front of his face in a surprisingly non-glamorous guise. Isn't this the story of most of our lives?!<br /><br />That's my opinion.
B000Q66JXA|5.0|I had this movie in my collection of VHS...people are saying what is that.  Anyway, had to purchase the dvd to keep it as a stable in my movie collection.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read the first book and wasn't sure I was going to read anymore, but decided to continue to the end.  I can't figure out why any woman would let a man do that to her and why he wanted to do those abusive things.  As, I read the second book I realized why even though that did not excuse him, but then it started to turn into more of a love story with a lot more respect for her and her feelings.  By the end of the last book, I really enjoyed them and they made more sense to me.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Only really good movies are going on my kindle and this movie qualifies.  Saw it in the theaters and loved it and love it even more on my kindle.

B0065GC0BA|5.0|I was  initially quite shocked when I found out what Lee ,the quadraplegic  young man ,wanted to do on a certain date and the distress and confusion it caused for Louissa, his carer, and his mother.Jo Jo Moyes portrayed the emotions and rights of the individual with real sensitivity.

B006HL9G10|5.0|Love this Meditation timer!  I use it on my phone consistently, and loved it so much, that I purchased it for my Kindle HD.  One of my personal goals was to meditate more, and this app helps me do that.<br /><br />It keeps tally of the time I spend in meditation over a day, week, month, and overall.  It gives me averages.  The timer aspect keeps me from opening one eye to look at the clock, so I can let myself go deeper into meditation and leave that worry behind.<br /><br />The app also has a community feature where I can see who is meditating with me at the same time all over the world.  I can encourage them, and they can encourage me.<br /><br />There are different singing bowl sounds to sound the beginning, intervals, or ending of the meditation, and all can be set to my desired sound and volume.<br /><br />It can time incomplete meditations for open length meditations, and it can time other activities without applying the time to my meditation.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite apps!
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book, I  was just a bit difficult for me to follow at times, but it was  still a great book
B00005JNS0|1.0|This movie is in many ways just a joy to watch, but the ending is so anti-moral that I fear for the parents who don't discuss with their children whether it is right or wrong to throw a race, even if you feel sorry for one of the competitors. Remember the 1919 Chicago White Sox? They threw the World Series. They didn't get approbation-they nearly got jailed, and they were all out of baseball for life. Is this a lesson you want Disney to be teaching your kids? Motivation for committing a crime has no bearing on guilt or innocence, only in determining the degree of punishment. The protagonist got NO punishment for his crime. All those cheering for him were disappointed. The nominal winner, when he found out about it and it would be easy to find out, would not value his title, for he had not truly EARNED it. If you decide to show it to your kids, sit down and discuss with them whether the hero was TRULY a hero, or just another weakling. Better luck with finding something for your kids. I too kept hoping the older car would win, but his win was poisoned for me when his admiring competitor threw the race to him.

B0041KVV8U|5.0|When I first heard the British Beatle LPs, I thought that Capitol Records did a hatchet job on The Beatles' music.  I own The Beatles Collection box set of original British LPs which sounds clean and crisp.  Of course, there were gaps from the singles, B-sides and odds and ends which did not appear on the original British LPs.  So when I found the original Past Masters double LP as the 1980s drew to a close and before LPs disappeared from record stores, I had to get it as it was a Godsend.  It was on the purple Capitol label and sounded just as clean as the original British LPs.  \\"I Feel Fine\\" was a BIG improvement without all that reverb.  So all I needed was Magical Mystery Tour and I found the German LPs with all the tracks in true stereo.  Now with the remastered LPs available, I bought the remastered MMT with all the pages as well as the remastered Past Masters. No Beatle music collection is complete without Past Masters.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very useful. Nice feature is it tells me how much time left for doing different functions, like web surfing, listening to music, tv shows, etc.

B008745B32|4.0|This book is a classic novel of its time.  It is dated in many ways, but this now serves to present a picture of society at the time, when people (perhaps especially in England) were more constricted by the primarily unwritten rules and regulations of their class.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|The movie is kind of dark as would be expected from Tim Burton. I was surpirsed how strange and sad it was though. I don't see this as a kid friendly movie at all.

But Becky is facing bigger problems with Luke's birthday, banks failing and decline of sales at her personal shopping job, Becky is struggling to hold it all together.<br />\\"Mini Shopaholic\\" is the lastest book in the series by Sophie Kinsella and I have to say that I hope it is the last book and I say this as a fan of the series. I can't belive Becky's behavior. It seems that over the course of six book Becky has gotten worse and has not learned anything. Luke must a saint for putting with everything that his wife does. It was a good series in the beginning but its is time for Becky and the gang to go off into the sunset.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked that August never gives up, and he faces challenges really well.  Since he has facial deformities, he gets teased a lot, but he also has really good friends.  I like how different people narrate the story, for instance August, his sister, and two of his friends.  August cares a lot about people and not much about how he looks.  I didn't think that I would like it at first, but now it's one of my favorite books.  (Written by 9 year old reader)
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Outstanding wardrobe, special effects and scenery. I could easily watch it again even with the sound turned off although I recommend watching it with the sound on.

0307744434|5.0|I love this oxymoron--magical realism.  This book falls squarely in that category, and it did not immediately draw me in.  Now that Harry Potter's adventures are finished, I wasn't sure if I was really up for more wizardry.  Celia and Marco are two young magicians who have been bound into a competition against one another, without either knowing who their adversary is.  The venue is a very special circus that seems to be sort of a combination of Cirque du Soleil, Hogwarts, and Alice in Wonderland.  Le Cirque des Reves (Circus of Dreams) runs from dusk to dawn (the time of dreams, of course) and gives both illusionists an opportunity to showcase their extraordinary talents, which far exceed those of mortal man.  The circus also gives the author a chance to showcase her vast imagination for what would make for a truly stunning visitors' experience, if the laws of the universe did not apply.  The storyline occasionally flits forward a few years to Bailey, a young man at a crossroads, uncertain whether he should create his own way by going to Harvard, or bend to paternal pressure to take over the farm.  He becomes entangled with one of the circus performers, who may offer a third option.  The author really cast a spell on me, though, with the love story that develops between Celia and Marco, even as they discover that they are rivals in their inescapable duel.  Their connection is so electric that it leaps off the page, proving once again that love is more magical than any wishing tree, labyrinth, or ice garden.
B005ARYDYC|5.0|this is a great movie the music is the kind you will never forget and its the classic of the small town that isnt allowed to dance or play music and where the kids fight the town in a great battle of the bible and the people who follow it in a world that seems blind this movie is one i cant stop watching
0920668372|5.0|The first time I picked up this book at a book fair, to my embarrassment, I started bawling at the end, all snot and tears -- the book vendor, with an understanding smile, handed me the box of tissues he'd stashed beneath the table.  I read this to all three of my children as they were growing up and each time, I'd cry -- my children came to expect it, and while they teased me about it, were always happy to curl up in my lap, listen to me read it, enjoy the gentle humor of the lines and the illustrations, and then jump up and get me a tissue and a cuddle at the end.  It's been many years since I've read the book -- my eldest is nearly 17 and my youngest is 13 -- and just reading the reviews had me crying all over again.  There's something so perfect about the refrain \\"I love you forever, I like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\" It so beautifully encapsulates the love one has for one's child, how utterly immutable and deep that love is.  I'm not a cryer, but this one does it to me every single time.

B005LAIH2C|3.0|Hollywood seems to be on a fairy tale kick these days and when one studio is on a kick, the others have to follow suit to compete. Last year we had competing Snow White movies and the first movie to follow suit this year is \\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\", an R-rated take on the classic fairy tale. As a reminder, Hansel and Gretel are the two twins who stumble across a house made of candy in the forest and commence to eating before they realize that they are enjoying the spells of an evil witch. That is pretty much how this movie starts out as well, but after that, the fairytale is elaborated upon to say the least.<br /><br />Hansel and Gretel are legendary witch hunters when the movie picks up in the middle of a small town about to burn a supposed-witch at the stake. The town has had a rash of child abductions and in classic witch movie fashion, they are out for blind justice on whatever witch they can get their hands on. Jeremy Renner (Hansel) and Gemma Arterton (Gretel) play the title roles and they bring a strong level of coolness to a movie that is already loaded with coolness.<br /><br />The movie starts off fast and never slows down. The action is fast and furious and the 3D is exceptional. The action scenes are quick and entertaining, although much of the moments are lost with edits that are too quick. Things come hurtling toward your face and to say the least, the 3D works well. Just because a movie is loaded with non-stop coolness and special effects doesn't mean that it is without flaw though.<br /><br />\\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" is 95 minutes of entertainment and excitement. The villain, Muriel, played by Famke Janssen, is exciting and dangerous. You fear her after the first time she single-handedly annihilates a group of witch hunters. Unfortunately though, that is the only real emotion I ever felt in the movie. The movie never slowed down to establish a connection with its title characters and the audience. When their lives are in jeopardy or their friend's lives are in jeopardy, it never once pulled my emotional string. They justify that emotion as well, by not caring either.<br /><br />\\"Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters\\" is a fun trip to the movies, but when it's over, it's over. You won't care about it anymore. It won't live on in conversation with any of your friends. It garners only a shrug of the shoulders and a quick, \\"Ehh.\\" It's too bad too because it is also one of those movies that had the potential to be great. The director obviously knew what he was doing visually, but was too wrapped up in looking cool that he forgot to make people care.or their friend's lives are in jeopardy, it never once pulled my emotional string.

B0090SI4KG|4.0|After a stint as Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger has returned in his first lead role as an actor. With his life full of scandal and his ability to win back an audience in question, Arnold certainly reminds me of why he was such a successful movie star in the first place. He may (I take that back). He will never win an Oscar in his life, although I think Schwarzenegger's future as an actor is well in tact for one simple reason. He is oozing with charisma.<br /><br />I was reminded of this after watching the charisma-challenged Colin Farrell step into his shoes in \\"Total Recall\\" earlier this year. Regardless of what you think of Arnold Schwarzenegger, he shines on screen when it comes to bringing you, the audience, into his films and making you care about him and the others around him. Apparently Hollywood thinks the same because including \\"The Last Stand\\" he has eight movies in the works through 2014.<br /><br />\\"Last Stand\\" takes place in a small, nothing ever happens here, Arizona border town with probably too many police officers; four. Schwarzenegger plays Ray Owens, a former Los Angeles police officer who came to Arizona to get away from the relentless chaos and trials of big city police work. His fellow officers are just the opposite. They are either not prepared for such police work or eager for such police work. So when a ruthless Mexican drug kingpin escapes from FBI custody and begins hurtling their way in a specially outfitted car that is capable of going 200 MPH, they are about to get more trouble then they bargained for.<br /><br />\\"Last Stand\\", along with Schwarzenegger, reminds me of how long it has been since a great action movie has been made. We've had action movies, but very few are worthy of repeat viewing or five-years from now we'll still be watching it. \\"The Last Stand\\" may just be one of those movies. The humor is plentiful and the personality is rich. The story is quality enough and the action never exceeds a level of reality or even comes close to a level of absurdity that we normally see in action movies these days. The movie is well filmed and has a level of coolness that puts it over the top.<br /><br />The only thing I would criticize about \\"The Last Stand\\" would be a fairly uncreative collision of bad guy and good guy in the middle of town. Where most of the movie was creative and had numerous moments that led the audience to believe that the officers of this tiny town were pretty much doomed. The cartel finally just show up in town, line up across the street (I think there were 9) and declare everybody dead. The movie, as creative as it was, could have done better.<br /><br />This one criticism is a pretty small detail in a movie that otherwise was a smashing success of entertainment, action and comedy. \\"The Last Stand\\" is a throwback to when action movies were good. There was a time when action movies didn't rely on absurd stunts that cross into fantasyland or had herky-jerky MTV editing that disguised how poorly the scenes are choreographed or assumed that the audience was only interested in 100-minutes of bullets zipping.

0307277453|5.0|An amazing story of biological evolution all the way from a fish to you! Great storyline and astonishing research and hard work was put behind the discovery of the first &#34;fish with limbs&#34; which further proved the transition of aquatic life to land animals.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Each episode was fresh and left me wanting more. Great characters and the acting is superb.  I liked it so much that I will continue to watch the Series on PBS.
0553801473|1.0|Others have already written excellent (and funny) reviews of this book, noting how pointless and meandering the story and characters have become in Dance with Dragons. I am so annoyed with G.Martin and where he has taken us with DoD that I feel I must add my two cents. As others have said, the first three books were amazing. I could not wait to turn the page to see what happened, nevermind get to the next book in the series. However, at this point, I fear the author has either lost his way, or gone off track from where he originally intended to go with this series in an effort to keep the money flowing. I hate to be so jaded but I really feel like this series was meant to be a trilogy, and would have been one of the best trilogies out there -- but instead it has been dragged out for non-creative reasons that have killed the series. Perhaps it is just that G.Martin loves the characters and story so much that he can't stop dragging it out, or perhaps he has gotten bored with the story and the characters. Whatever the reason, he has lost me. I was getting skeptical at Bk 4, but carried on in the hope that he had possibly just hit a slow spot. Then, DoD confirmed it for me. The series has languished to a point that becomes almost comical (as evidenced by some of the hysterical \\"character\\" commentaries included in other reviews). I hope G. Martin reads the reviews posted here and re-thinks his plan to drag this out further. As for me, I believe I am done with this series out of exhaustion and boredom. I do want to know \\"how it all ends\\" though, so if I ever see that the final 7th or 11th or 15th book has been published, I will probably read it to close the chapter once and for all.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the many books i have read about the war. it was a great read. talks about the problems the men had going to war then coming home. and some of the other political bs that goes on in this country of ours..mainly the ROE bs that men behind a desk tell these guys how they should fight..man behind the desk if you know how to do it why dont you get from behind the desk and grab a gun and do it..Chris thank you for your service....

B0000029AP|5.0|I found this album at Strawberries in April of 2011, and there's not a single weak track on this album. \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" is a good \\"get up and dance\\" tune, and two iconic songs - \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and \\"Walk This Way\\" - made their debut on this album. This is a must have for any Aerosmith fan - seriously, you can't not have this album for your collection. Pure vintage Aerosmith. Need I say more?

B0065UF2ZM|4.0|Another absorbing and tightly written Harry Bosch thriller from this reliable author set in his usual slightly gritty LA setting.  Some interesting overtones about the importance of maintaining reason in the face of a suspected terrorist threat flesh out the standard whodunnnit elements of the story. An enjoyable read for Harry Bosch fans, but if you are new to the character, maybe start on an earlier Connelly Bosch novel so you get to know this great character in the way he has been skilfully developed over time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's been a long time since I've found any show that has me excited as I am now.  This is, by far, one of the best shows ever and Amazon made it so easy for purchase for use with my Kindle Fire.

B0015DROBO|3.0|I found myself drowning in all the foreign names.  I stuck with it because it got very good reviews and seemed quite popular.<br />After getting more familiar with all the people, it was easier to absorb more story.  I enjoyed following the main character in trying to discover more clues in this ages old incident.  The story picks up the pace towards the end and I did find that I enjoyed it.
B004X75RK4|4.0|This movie was super cheesy and predictable, but fun to watch. It is pretty clean, too. Sandra Bullock always does a good job of playing the &#34;tough girl&#34; who turns &#34;soft.&#34;

B008220BLG|5.0|(Possible spoilers)<br />This is a zombie romantic comedy.  Zombie comedies in themselves are still a brand new genre imo, but try a zombie romantic comedy , and that's still a relatively untouched genre. First movie that came to mind before I saw \\"Warm Bodies\\" was \\"My Boyfriend's back\\" from 1993. I loved that movie, and I definitely love this movie.<br /><br />Where to begin? It's extremely funny, but it does it in a way that it is natural and not scripted.<br /><br />The acting choices were great for this: Teresa Palmer,  Nicholas Hoult, Analeigh Tipton, Rob Corddry, and of course John Malkovich.<br /><br />Plot: Well the trailer does give away a lot of the movie.  A zombie named \\"R\\" (Hoult) is one of the few zombies that has been able to transcend his \\"condition\\" and actually is displaying some human interactions that he actually has made a connection with a beautiful girl named Julie (Palmer) whose part of a zombie resistance force.  They make an unexpected connection between themselves that will change their lives. Meanwhile Julie's father w Grigio (Malkovich) whose a top military person  does not share Julie's views that zombies can be capable of anything other than feeding on human flesh. To further complicate things  a group of zombies (?) called \\"Bonies\\" inhibit \\"R\\"'s area and are looking for him.<br /><br />I know this is based on a novel but not reading the novel I judged the movie as a standalone feature (of course comparing it other zombie movies) and of course zombie lore in general.<br /><br />I know the great George Romero is one of the first directors that I know off that explored the ideas of zombies still retaining some human characteristics, and even still having their memories (though fragmented) still in them, so I was interested to see how this movie played that. I liked that the movie explored that fully.<br /><br />Jonathan Levine's direction is good.  All the scenes are setup very well for perfection.<br /><br />\\"R\\"'s progression starts very slowly (from the narration we get him from in the beginning to zombie grunts we come to expect from a dead corpse) then gradually it accelerates to where he actually perform speech very well and do other things. Likewise \\"R\\"'s and Julie's relationship doesn't just fly off, but it grows gradually as well as we see how \\"R\\" is beginning to change because of her.<br /><br />Hoult and Palmer are absolutely perfect for their roles. They were both convincing and worked well off each other.<br /><br />The jokes in this movie are funny as hell. I don't remember any zombie movie where the zombie played music for a girl, or a zombie learns how to drive, or even offered a girl a beer!!!<br /><br />There's action and gore but it's  PG 13, so it's toned down, but that wasn't the real selling point of the movie. The selling point was the comedy and romance, and the movie definitely nailed it out of the park in that regard.<br /><br />The screening audience I saw it with laughed at every setup and every joke literally. There's some social commentary as well, and some nice little twists that kept the audience entertained till the very end.<br /><br />I really recommend it.

It goes into a lot of detail over and over however and I think it could have been explained in more street wise examples as I am not a medical professional.  I am happy I purchased it though as I'm very interested in this subject.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Rodriguez's voice is clear and music is well orchestrated. He's quite an insightful poet and his words reflect timeless events and emotions.
0385536828|5.0|One quote from this novel (about the character who is a writer) perfectly describes how I feel about Ian McEwan himself: \\"From the very first paragraph you are in his hands, you know he knows what he is doing, and you can trust him.\\"<br /><br />I have read all McEwan's novels, and I have never considered any of them less than first-rate. He has written several different kinds of novels, and some I have liked better than others because I enjoy that style, but all are written to perfection and convey exactly what he intended. All the plots seem somewhat predictable in the beginning, but turn out to be anything but what you would have expected. And this is the highest praise that I, personally, can give a writer: When I read McEwan I forget that I am reading a made-up story.<br /><br />This one features a young female protagonist, who is hired in the 1970s by the British secret service (M15) following her graduation from Cambridge. Even though she studied maths in university, she is an avid, non-discriminatory reader of novels, consuming three and four a week. (I felt some kinship, here.) With the Cold War and the struggle for hearts and minds still going on, she is sent as an undercover operative to get to know a young writer who might turn out to be helpful to the government. She falls in love with his writings, and then she falls in love with him. Obviously, she has a conflict of interests.<br /><br />Despite the basic plot description, this is not a typical spy novel by any means. The danger here is not of being physically harmed, but of being revealed to a loved one as duplicitous and to the world at large as being a fool.<br /><br />This is also a consideration of the difference between real life and fiction and of creating a reality through writing. And it is funny in the smooth, understated British way. (Not in the wacky British way; they appear to have two, distinct styles of humor over there.) But, most of all, it is a great story.<br /><br />Sometimes when Iwas reading this, I thought to myself, \\"McEwan missed it there. I'm disappointed in him.\\" I should have trusted him. The ending causes it all to make perfect sense and makes me want to immediately re-read the book to see how he accomplished what he did--a total surprise, yet with all the clues there.

0143039830|3.0|These three short novels first present themselves as typical mysteries, perhaps in the tradition of Raymond Chandler, but it soon becomes apparent that they are not in any way traditional, and that, in fact, the mystery is not what is contained in the plot but what in the world the author is intending to impart to the confounded reader.<br /><br />The novels, essentially, all tell the same story, just with different protagonists and different scenarios: An investigator becomes so immersed in another person's life that he loses himself, becoming the other person in his mind.<br /><br />The first novel, City of Glass, tells the story of an author, a writer of mysteries under a pseudonym, who receives a mis-directed phone call to a detective (named Paul Auster) and then pretends to be that detective. He is hired to shadow a father just released from prison, convicted of imprisoning his son for years without human contact to allow him to develop his own language.<br /><br />The second novel, Ghosts, is more obviously metaphoric, with the detective Mr. Blue being hired by Mr. White to watch Mr. Black, for an undisclosed reason.<br /><br />In the third novel, The Locked Room, a failed fiction writer is drawn into the world of his childhood friend, who has disappeared. Receiving a note from the disappeared man, the protagonist becomes obsessed with finding him.<br /><br />These \\"detective\\" novels all become absurdist novels, with the protagonists performing inexplicable obsessive actions. All involve writing, often in a red notebook. All involve a loss of self. All involve, I think, a quest for meaning in life. But who knows?<br /><br />I will have to admit that this kind of book is not my favorite. I generally like a story that makes sense and has a minimum of pretentious flourishes. Those who appreciate affected postmodern literature will love it, undoubtedly. It is well done on a strictly intellectual level, but is too clever for its own good.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|August is a character that faces many problems. His friends stand up for him, which I wished happened in my school.  This is a wonderful book.
0307476464|4.0|An attractive young woman climbs down an emergency exit stair from a freeway, and finds that the world seems to have changed just a bit from what she remembers. For instance, the night sky has two moons. She is an expert assassin, who eliminates men who have abused women.<br /><br />A enigmatic 17-year-old girl writes a rather amateurish, yet highly original, first-person novella about Little People who emerge from the mouth of a dead goat and create an Air Chrysalis, which finally opens to reveal an exact copy of the narrator. The girl says that the story is true. In her account, the earth has two moons.<br /><br />A young man who is an aspiring novelist is persuaded by an ambitious editor to rewrite the girl's story and let it be published under the girl's name. It becomes a best seller. One day he notices that the sky has two moons.<br /><br />A private detective is hired by a religious cult to investigate matters pertaining to the above characters. He finds a connection that has escaped the cult's notice.<br /><br />This is a page-turner of a cat-and-mouse thriller, a highly romantic (although somewhat implausible) love story, a reconciliation story between parent and child, an examination of religious belief, and a fantasy/alternate world adventure. That's a lot to accomplish in one novel.<br /><br />By allowing himself 900+ pages, Murakami manages to pack all of this in, plus a good bit of filler, to my way of thinking. He includes detailed descriptions of clothing worn (even though the garments are, at best, nondescript), of the preparation of many simple Japanese meals (very healthful foods. I must say), and even of day-to-day grooming details (They were very clean people.). I can only suppose that these mundane matters were included to provide contrast with the many surreal matters. But it becomes a bit ridiculous after a while.<br /><br />This novel was impossible to put down and very easy to read, so that it can be finished as quickly as most books half its length. I found it more readable than other Murakami novels, but also less thought-provoking.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just got this game today and the whole family is loving it!  I do the harder levels and can't hardly put it down, and my 4-yr-old loves the easier levels. Definitely a great game!
B007F7QG0Y|4.0|Yes, this is the Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, so you can easily guess what the autobiography talks about. That's right--sex and drugs and rock and roll.<br /><br />The book reads as if it is the direct transcript of a long, somewhat rambling oral account, rather than as an organized, thought-out, written life history. And as such it is unexpectedly revealing and fascinating, rather like becoming Keith's new mate and sitting around yarning with him. At the end you feel that you really know and understand him, even though you realize that he has undoubtedly shaded the details to picture himself in a favorable light--at least what he considers a favorable light, although society in general might not agree.<br /><br />There's the sex part, although by his own account he was not a Don Juan with a legion of lovers. He had long-term relationships with, and children with, only two women. Apparently, the \\"getting laid\\" aspect of rock and roll fame was not uppermost in his agenda. He actually comes across as rather shy in his self-reported dealings with women.<br /><br />And the drug part, which loomed large in his life. Heroin was his drug of first choice, and he was indulging in it or withdrawing from it for most of his performing life. This aspect of his story comes across as most suspect of being slanted, as he insists that it did not interfere with his music career and downplays its effect on the people around him. In fact, as with many addicts and even former addicts, he seems to be boasting about his drug experiences.<br /><br />But it's the rock and roll aspect that really animates this life history. Keith obviously loves music, all kinds of music, and lives to make music and to explore its possibilities. For a non-musician such as myself, a good bit of the book is over my head because it discusses in detail such things as open tuning and chord progression and such-like, but I can imagine that for a musician this aspect would be especially fascinating.<br /><br />Some interesting information that Keith Richards provides: He seems to be a devoted family man with obvious love for his children and his (now deceased) parents. Of course, how his frequent absences and drug-related problems affected them is overlooked here. His on-again, off-again quarreling with Mick Jagger is explained, although obviously from Keith's viewpoint. He takes a very humorous swipe at Mick with a dismissive description of his male equipment.<br /><br />Autobiographies are obviously very suspect as to truthfulness, but this seems to be more truthful than most and certainly more interesting and amusing than most (And as I write this, I can hear \\"Start Me Up\\" in my head. Who doesn't love the Stones!)

B009CPES4I|5.0|As I am a &#34;baby-boomer&#34; this movie meant a lot more to me than it would for a younger viewer.<br />It is a life affirming movie for those of us who are older which says even though our bodies are now<br />compromised our spirits are just as strong, if not stronger, than in our younger years. Not to put<br />off things we want to do any longer as long as we are still capable physically. We cripple ourselves<br />when we tell ourselves mentally that we are not capable.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful bible app for reading god's word plus posting daily verses to facebook each morning. Wondering could I uses this in church, hey it's not a cell phone, just thinking :-)
B0063GORYU|5.0|OK, kind of like being the old man on Pawn Stars, but it sure is fun when you need a break from reality.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Another wonderful and great app on amazon - Twitter, I use it like it looks great on my Kindle Fire HD. Nothing to think about just get it and it will get you! :D LOL
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Don't know much about Bluetooth speakers but this one is great very loud (you can adjust) and connects to two phones which it does very well.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I enjoyed this film so much that I purchased the book and DVD to give as a gift to a friend. The film tells a complicated story with so many twists and turns that it keeps you interested. The writer illustrates enormous skill in building the many layers of the story. It reveals a new perspective on the victims of the Holocaust and their ongoing problems.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|This is very easy to sync and use. It is easy to use with two phones. Fantastic is the best description I can think of. The 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the voice activated dialing. Even with common names it has trouble recognizing the pronunciation. This is probably not the fault of the device.
0743270754|5.0|Wow!  I'm neither an historian nor a really close Lincoln follower, but I am an avid reader.  I started this book about a year ago, before the movie \\"Lincoln\\" was released, and for some reason read about halfway through it. I then got caught up in other reading and never returned to this book until after I had seen the movie \\"Lincoln\\", when I again took up the book and after reviewing some of my previous reading continued to read this excellent rendition of Abraham Lincoln. I must say that I found that Lincoln was not nearly the man I thought he was, i.e a self educated rail splitter who happened to become President of the United States. Instead I found that Abraham Lincoln was a man of his time, who, although self-educated was one of the shrewdest men and politicians the country has ever seen. He would have been right for the office at any time in out history. Slightly dictorial, manipulative,and an arm twister, he was able to use these \\"talents\\" for the good of our country, a good that exists today. He was compassionate yet at the same time determined to do things his way. I don't believe he thought anything but the manner in which he saw things was to be followed. Although surrounded by magnificent talent, i.e. Seward, Blaine, Chase, Blair and on and on, he managed in each time of  crises to convince these people that his was the right way to travel, and then went on to prove time and again that he was right.  His persistence saved the country and made it what it is today. (I am however puzzled by his tolerance of Gen.McClellan). Although I don't believe emancipation was his original goal, I think he acted out of anger, and as a result our country has been much the better for it. To me Lincoln is our second greatest President, following George Washington who I believe held the Union together at its must vulnerable time. I can only thank Doris Kearns Goodwin for her ten years of effort. My children, and their children will always have this reference.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|I was looking for google maps but came across this one. It is different but very valuable. The nice thing is that you do not have to load in everything that you do not need thereby saving space on RAM , I chose Bahamas, Florida maps, they were loaded and concise. For what there is I am very happy. I chose four stars because no matter how good something is there is always a way to improve the product
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm not a big reader and don't have a lot of spare time to read.  It's been great having a digital copy on my phone that I can read anytime and anywhere.  It also helped having it on my phone because people wouldn't know I was reading such steamy stuff when I was at work, church, family events, etc.  They just thought I was checking my mail or something!  LOL
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It's been too long coming, but worth the wait!  Truly great read that like all the Clancy books will leave you wondering, could this really happen?  If you're a Jack Ryan fan, you'll love it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|if you delete this app it will seek its revenge and u will not be able to get it back choose wisely unlike me who did not know so now u have a fair warning
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I've watched each Resident Evil since the first came out on DVD. Even walking in to the last three with almost no expectations, R.E. couldn't even meet that sad level. The series is quickly heading into the Utter Disappointment level, seemingly trapped in some stale formula, confined by video game roots and a pretend that it needs to stick to the level/boss framework.<br /><br />This is the worst of the series. I might say \\"avoid like the plague,\\" but given the subject matter that could be a flattering pun. This movie sucked. Move along, nothing to see here.
B007TXS512|2.0|Video quality is great on these but if you haven't see the contest, do NOT watch the extras until you watch the entire program. Disk One with the first part of the semi finals has a spoiler in the extras that gives away the final winner.<br /><br />Disk TWO is an unknown because my copy did NOT come with a disk two. I returned it and the replacement ALSO did not have disk two. Terrible quality control on these.<br /><br />Disk three was fine and the contest itself was wonderful. The only reason this copy gets two stars. Otherwise it'd be one star.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|If you didn't enjoy the original Total Recall because you thought the story needed a reboot with weaker dialogue, an uninspired plot, snazzier CG, and hotter women... this is the version for you. Do not be surprised when you find yourself nodding with the truth in my review as it's a pointless relaunch. The only reason for it is if there's a a second and third one behind this one. And I can totally see that occurring if potential investors never let this slide into their bluray player.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What else can I say but wow! This game Is great to play when you feel competitive or just in the playing mood. I strongly recommend this game.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|My wife and I watched Looper based on its box office popularity, the previews, and a mention from a friend. While we found it interesting, the previews definitely did not portray it in a way that was congruent with the story. Go into expecting that you know little about the story and go along for the ride. At the end, if you'd like a bit more insight into the Looper timeline(s), check out the two main Looper timeline infographics. They helped pull the movie together... at least for me.
B0011Z933S|5.0|Few albums like this have all great songs, but this one does. Very well recorded and sung. I highly recommend it to avid fans and ppl new to DC4C.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|Great animation movie with a twist of Hawaiian Style verbage and dialect. Enjoyment for those of us missing the Hawaiian Tropics.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Best series I have seen in awhile. My husband and I can't get enough. Claire Daines is one of the best actresses of her generation.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I bate when they say its free but only for so far. tell me that I will get a sample and then have to pay this much.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|works great to help my kiddo sleep through the night.  lots of options and sound quality is great. download it for yourself.
0765325950|5.0|Everything I wanted and so much more.  Watching your favorite series come to an end is bittersweet.  Knowing that we won't have any more books in the Wheel of Time leaves a horrible feeling deep inside.  But this was an excellent end and it is a testament to it's greatness that it leaves me thirsting for more.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I love MIB. All of them. Josh Brolin does a superb job playing young J and the plot unwinds nicely. I have watched it twice and will purchase the trilogie when it is available.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I read this book in two days. I really enjoyed it.  I love books where men confess their undying love. Interested to see what book two brings.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Nice sic-fi flick. Some problems with the time travel paradox, but nothing that would bother the non-time travel fan. Watch it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Works great on kindle fire! We love temple run and now we love temple run 2 !!! It is more challenges.  Different twists and turns. New monsters and mine cars. Great game even if it wasn't free, would have paid for it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|well first on all you cant skip objections and they all are super hard. And why is it so hard to turn on this game? and the game shuts off sometimes when you click &quot;save me.&quot; there is also no way to change tilt sensitivity and some times you get stuck in that one position for awhile. But I love the game idea and is more thrilling and bright than the orginal. Hopefully Temple run 2 could get a black female and a Asians male :) thanks for reading hope this helped! :D
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I don't write reviews really so me even typing this says something. This is a great cooler. Its heat pipe design is great for only $30.<br /><br />  I am using this in my latest build that is using an AMD A10-5800K Quad core processor with integrated 7660D graphics. Before I really dive I will begin by saying I am an overclocker. Also I am using a 3 fan push, pull, pull configuration (This was hard to achieve but works well):<br /><br />CPU- 4.2 Ghz (3.8 Org.)- 1.472 v<br />APU-Northbridge- 2.0 Ghz (1.5 Org.)- 2.75 v<br />iGPU- 1 Ghz (800 Mhz Org.)- 2.75 Ghz<br />RAM- 1.866 Ghz 10-10-10-27 (1.6 Ghz 10-10-10-27 Org.)- 1.632 v<br /><br />There you go that is what this thing is cooling. Everything that can be overclocked is. So here are the temps:<br /><br />CPU- Idle: 27c...... Full load using Prime95: 53<br />iGPU- Idle: 40c..... Full load: 56<br /><br />GPUs always run hotter than CPUs so those are pretty good temps. My goal is to always stay under 60c because the healthy level for most components is 70c so in my mind this will keep my components in better condition. How you use yours is up to you, so if your limit is higher you can overclock more.<br /><br />I am using Ceramique 2 in this review but I am switching to Arctic Silver 5 which will perform better (So realistically this can be even better with the right paste)<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Great performance<br />2. $30 (I still cant get past the price to performance ratio here)<br />3. Very secure mounting<br />4. Has 4 direct contact copper heat pipes<br />5. Large dissipation area<br />6. Comes with a high quality PWM fan<br />7. Quiet with 1 fan (After two is gets audible)<br />8. Universal bracket<br />9. Made out of high quality materials<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Because this is a universal bracket the instructions are a little vague.<br />2. The base is uneven due to heat pipe design causing ridges between he aluminum and copper. (Solved with EVO)<br />3. Only comes with one fan (For the price, you getwhat you payed for, go buy another if you really need it)<br />4. Audible after 1 fan<br />5. Kinda a pain to install sometimes. (Though its alot easier if your case is like mine and allows access to the back bracket of the CPU for the exact purpose of changing heat sinks)<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this to anyone. This is a wonderful product that is for a low price. The performance is great. What more could you ask for?
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Recently TuneIn launched an app update for paid subscribers: the update continues to fail resulting in a poor rating.  This protracted problem situation seems strange to me because (from personal experience) TuneIn's iOS app is useful and dependable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie!  I could not put this book down!  Nicholas sparks never dissapoints!!! I think the movie will be just as good as the book!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love this game - have had no problems except its hard to put it down once you start playing. love it
B00A757EFW|3.0|I found it a little hard to move the Pac-Man so I was not real successful with the game. I like Pac-Man.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it has awesome graphics and plenty of activities to do while waiting for your horse to gain energy. it is the best horse game that I have played on my kindle.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|She writes and sing songs that just touch my heart. Pure talent without having to strip her clothes off and parade around half naked. Also, to hear real instrument instead of the electronic junk that is produce in the US.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|the reason why i gave it 4 stars is becuase it wouldnt open it would keep going back to the main menu but other then that awesome app
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an awesome game! One of the coolest I ever played! Sure this game crashes, so what! Haters gonna be haters. Give it a try! Have fun!! :)
B005LAII1C|4.0|Got this dvd for my son for Christmas. He's watched it about five times already. I love Mark Walberg, Funny movie!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's a typical solitaire game. The free version is very obnoxious with intrusive ads but they can at least be skipped over. I would have rated higher if the ads were just at top or bottom instead of being so intrusive.
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|I usually only write these when I enjoy a film, I was excited I love thirties gangster films especially the Dillinger era. This film never got off the ground, whoever edited it did a horrible job it did not peice together at all i really wanted to like it, but it really sucked. Everybody is different but this film poorly done the acting was mediocre, the story never got going once you thought it was it went a different direction, for 4.00 watch one of the old B films on Dillinger with Warren Oates pretty cheesy but much better than this terrible film. If I could give it minus 5 I would for dissapointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is like the best game since subway surfers. And I know everybody was getting tired of playing subway surfers. It has ok graphics but they need to upgrade there characters. Anyway this is still the best game of 2013 so Subway Surfers move aside cause you just got replaced.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I myself am not a big horror film buff, but my wife loves them unfortunately just like comedies there are very few good quality ones. I only picked this film because my wife usually picks horrible films, I only picked it because Jeffery Dean Morgan was in it, I think he is very underated actor. The film was very well done the only problem I had was it supposely based on a true story, if you beleive that we do not live on planet earth. If you like supernatural films you will enjoy very good acting and very good story. It is one of the few horror films worth the 4.00.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Great action, edge of your seat stuff.  Would recommend for older viewers only because of sex trade content.  Seems this could very well happen to naive, young lady travelers.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is so much fun a I am so happy that they made a second one!!! But I only got tp play a couple of games because after a few games the app starts to force close and it gets really anoying. Don't buy this app unless you want tp fall in love with a app then get angry about it not being able to open. :(
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I was given a Kindle Fire for Christmas, and I am just getting it set up with apps and books.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|Goodkind is a fraud!!!! I read the first book and hated the first three quarters, then the last quarter caught my interest. I then decided to buy the next book, and was thoroughly dissapointed. The main character Richard is a Jesus like character that can do no wrong. He is the god of every tribe he comes into contact with, he is the main focus of every prophesy ever written, he can do just about everything better than everyone else in the book. The dialogue is also very childish. I really would like the time I spent reading this garbage BACK!!!!!
B00980IA3M|3.0|I haven't bought this set, but I know almost all of the recordings that it contains.  Some of them are recordings that have \\"issues\\", and were not well received when first issued.  The Dutchman is almost unspeakably poorly cast.  Tannhauser is better, and has the benefit of the Paris version, so this is probably the sole reason to own this set.  Solti's Lohengrin is no more than mediocre (they should have used Abbado's or Kubelik's, both of which are better sung and better conducted).  The Jochum Meistersinger is an unmitigated disaster, and the Kleiber Tristan is worth hearing only for Price's Isolde; Kleiber was a great conductor of this work, but this recording defines the term \\"studio-bound\\".  The Solti Parsifal isn't terrible, but there are so many superior versions that it's simply not competitive (at least they didn't use the Thielemann).  As for the Ring, it's hard to recommend a set in which the Brunnhilde (Behrens) and Siegfried (Goldberg) are virtually unlistenable, but there are moments of greatness (particularly Salminen's Hagen).<br /><br />I haven't heard the recordings of Liebesverbot or Die Feen, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and award the set three stars, instead of the two that it deserves.
6305176299|5.0|New Years Eve 1994 my husband proposed to me while watching the movie Speed. So not only is it a great movie it is our movie and so for New Years Eve this year I surprised him with a bottle of wine and this Movie!
B001PPLKI0|5.0|Elvis was humble and loved gospel music. This is a rare look at his passion for what he truly wanted to sing. It's a shame that most of the world never really knew of this side of him but I'm glad we have his recordings in perpetuity!! God blessed Elvis Aaron Presley with his talent ...and he shared it with the world to His glory! Amen.
B004ZQBOXC|1.0|After being deeply offended by the debauchery and gross indecency in group's first album, I gave this album chance because, having read the title, I logically assumed that they were rejecting hedonism and wanton profligacy for a more sensible and moderate lifestyle. But from even a cursory listening it is obvious that these two are not in the least bit contrite for their party rocking ways. For shame. Apology NOT accepted!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very fun book that is very hard to put down.  Easily one of my top favorites of all time.
0345803507|5.0|I would greatly recommend this trilogy, very suspenseful, erotic, not a book you want to put down, keeps your interest from one book to the other.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Fun game but have a bad tendency to crash when it is asked to use a gem to &quot;save me&quot;. It drops back to the home screen but still use up a gem. Kindle fire HD and Galaxy Nexus
B005WUHAX8|3.0|real pain to plug in headphones, and charger.  cant hear speakers well.  hard to text and call and use apps.  almost feels liek there is a slight gap between phone and case.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|This was a great book. I loved it. It was exiting. It cost me at the edge of my seat. I recommend<br /> this Book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|first off, I have read over the years a number of Grisham's novels.  The Rainmaker, the Firm, my personal favorite, a recent read of both the Litigators and the Racketeer.  I did truly enjoy both reads, however, the Racketeer has a number of twists that we think we can predict, and we are totally off.  If I mention any more, I will have to provide a spoiler alert...thus...I will just let you read for yourself.
B006R4H5FG|5.0|Great read on the core principles of presentation. Lots of good, easy-to-apply tips. Gobs of examples. Your audiences will thank you for getting this.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I liked the first Temple Run, so I was excited to see how the sequel would square up. I am pleased to report that this new version is much improved over the first: better graphics, very useful power-ups, and (finally) the ability to choose different adventurers.<br />If you liked the first, you more than likely enjoy this one, as well.
030759565X|5.0|The Smitten Kitchen cookbook is an extraordinary collection of special recipes. This is not a \\"quick and easy dinner for every night of the week\\" cookbook, or an \\"everything you should know about cooking\\" cookbook. These recipes are inventive, beautiful, and absolutely mouthwateringly delicious. The recipes are creative yet approachable, and you can rest assured that they will taste fantastic. Many of the recipes are indulgent (think biscuits made with bacon grease!) and many are staples that you will come back to again and again. Thank you Deb for creating this fantastic collection.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I gave this to my friend for Christmas (since he's obsessed with zombies). He loves it. The rounds can be long or short depending on the how lucky you are at your rolls. It's tons of fun, and you don't have to think too much!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is an incredible story that just blows your mind. It will make you so angry at our system, but so proud of the human spirit and what we can endure and overcome. Jaycee is a remarkable women and I wish the best for her and her family.

B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this book and have seen the movie so many times that I know the book by heart. It is such a romantic story in a world that is far from the one we live in today. What an adventure that ends just the way you hoped. I love, I love, I love you!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Scott is very good at creating a world that Ender can survive in. Very interesting and entertaining take on the military, society, and war.

1594488886|4.0|This book is about two women, Mariam and Laila, who go through many hardships during a 30 year span while living in Afghanistan.  Mariam is a very sweet and kind girl who grows up to be a troubled woman.  Laila is a loving and caring girl who grows up going through horrible tragedies that form her into the woman she grows up to be.  The two women are brought together because of the main conflict.  They both end up marrying this dreadful man named Rasheed.  These two women go from being the worst of enemies to unlikely friends.  At the beginning of the story, Mariam is just a small girl who ends up learning her father is not the person she grew up knowing him to be.  He ends up sending her off on an arranged marriage to Rasheed who is more that twice her age.  This sets up the story.  Later on in the novel, you meet a young girl named Laila.  This is about 15 years after the story began.  As she comes of age, her parents are tragically killed during a bombing and Rasheed and Mariam help her get back on her feet.  By this time, she has no one to turn to and Rasheed offers her the option of being his wife, and she really had no other choice.  As the story progresses, it tells how Mariam and Laila grow to be good friends and how they get through life in Afghanistan during these terrible times.<br /> Overall, I thought the book was wonderful.  It was full of emotion and depth.  I really enjoyed how Hosseini would go back and forth between Mariam's point of view and Laila's point of view.  It really helped me understand the feelings between the two at a deeper level.  I also enjoyed how he spread the book out during a 30 year period.  It really helped the novel move along very smoothly.  It was also very nice that Hosseini included so many Afghan terms.  It helped give us more knowledge about Afghanistan.  I would recommend this book to anyone from their teens and up.  It is such a great book that really opens us up to life in Afghanistan and tells of situations that teens must go through that we usually don't have to worry about.  It opens our eyes into seeing different countries and their traditions and history.
B008476HBM|5.0|Nothing better than a classic Jane Austen book read on a modern technological marvel! Love my Kindle and love being able to download the classics for free!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I read this book based on a review I saw in a magazine. It's just wonderful. The characters are relatable and well developed, the plot moves along briskly and in some unexpected ways, and you get a hard look at some of our painful history. Great for book club, but I'm recommending it to everyone.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent! Next book!  I love romance novels and can't wait to start the next one. Perfect follow up to 50 shades.
0765325950|5.0|First of all, the angst towards the publishers needs to end.  I was more than happy to finalize my WOT shelf with the final hardcover of this incredible series, as my father before me gathered 1-6 and then I finished if off.  Remember people, this is a business and your financial standing should not negatively influence ratings on a work of art.<br />A great ending for something I thought would never end, (or maybe I just didn't want it to), MOL was non-stop action as I pictured it from the beginning.  Defunct of George RR Martin's blatant \\"character-cide\\", yet more realistic than the fairy tale endings so cumbersome in the works of Eddings, Brooks, and Goodkind.<br />Well written, well published and well delivered.  I hope those taking criticism realize that those giving it do not remember pay phones, let alone turning pages made of paper (oh my!).
B0095R64AO|5.0|I loved this movie! Husband just thought it was okay. It was a little long and drawn out but it kept me interested up until the very end! I'd watch it again.

B008A1NSTG|5.0|This movie was good. It would be a good family movie. It was boring in some parts. Some parts predictable, unless you already knew what happened at the end. Overall, a good movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Perfect way to pass the time, unwind &amp; escape for a bit. App is excellent! Till now no flaws, knock on wood.
0316077046|3.0|Baeutiful Darkness picks up the story follwoing the tumultuous ending of the frst book. This thread held a continuous tone of dark melancholy that permeated the action but realistically added to the poignancy and development of the characters' role in the story.  The reason this second book did not fall into a morass of young adult angst is because the story is told through the male's POV. Ethan doesn't spend a lot of time agonizing over what he has lost, with the help of his wonderlly loyal friend Link, Ethan get on with the business of trying to find solutions.  This second book kept me riveted. I bought all four books and enjoying every word, every cadence. Onto Beautiful Chaos.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|i can not imagine christmas without this movie do not know what ole clark will think of next. never a dull moment in the griswalds life
B002VECLVO|5.0|Firth's acting is simply masterly. He has shown here that he will be placed in the league of great actors like Laurence Olivier and Peter O'Toole. Very promising acting in Hoult as well.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Maybe its cause i'm a musician that i appreciate this so much, its just a fantastical true story. I really like (spoiler alert!!)<br /><br />even after he discovers his new fame, he remains really unphased by the entire thing, as if it just happens that way sometimes....just a feel good story.
B000ZM1FXO|1.0|One would expect better detail in the images but is naturally disappointed. So get a DVD instead. This is a waste of money.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This was a great book, full of great imagery and story. Definitely recommend this first book to any fantasy book lover
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are several downloadable version available for study needs. It helps when there is no Internet connection. I don't actually carry a Bible anymore because I have it on my phone and iPad. With access to several versions, I can follow the minister, regardless of the version he uses.  Plus, whenever we have to find several verses in different chapters, I can do so quickly and with ease. I loaded it on my daughter's Kindle also.  She likes the audio, and so do I.  It helps to hear the pronunciation of many of those difficult to pronounce words. Great tool!
B00133KFGW|4.0|This is a good movie.  I feel sympathetic to the musical feelings of the kid, even though I don't play an instrument. I like to tap my fingers and my feet whenever I hear a good song. In the past I have attempted to play the piano and clarinet, but I don't have a strong enough desire to learn or enough patience to continually practice.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This little thing works pretty good for a sharpener in the field. but if your at home i suggest getting something a little biggger than this thing. it is real easy for it to slip and you to about cut yourself with this thing.  but it does sharpen your knife pretty good
0142410373|5.0|I loved this book written by Roald Dahl.  There are a few differences from the movie. The book has a little bit of a religious touch to it. It is mentioned that the students have prayers and read the scriptures. Also it calls Matilda's gift a miracle and says it was the best miracle since Jesus. The scene where Matilda moves a lot of objects around in Trunchbull's house does not happen. By the end of the book she no longer has her telepathic gift. The teacher believes it is because she is finally being challenged in school.<br /><br />One of the Trunchbull's means of punishments is to forcibly make a fat (somewhat rude) boy by the name of Bruce Bogtrotter eat an enormous cake to try to make him sick after finding him guilty of stealing food from the kitchen. In many of Dahl's novels there is a rude character that is extremely fat.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|I have become completely obsessed with this show. I have seen the whole season 3 and I am in such anticipation for season 4 I wish I lived in the U.K. This shows keeps you guessing, has you crying, warms your heart and also makes you feel for the underdog. It grabs you from the first 5 minutes in always if you take the time to watch. Its worth it!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's a decently makde game, but I find that it has less of a challenge than the first temple run.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Who could doubt, with his parents, that he wouldn't come out just as great. He really did a wonderful job in this movie, a great tribute to the original.
B0084BMUFA|3.0|I thought this book was hard to understand sometimes but it was overall written well. I would recommend this book to people who like classics.
006441034X|5.0|If anyone's seen Hayao Miyazaki's films from Studio Ghibli than you'll know why I've bought this book. I couldn't get enough of the movie, having both the book and movie are just perfect.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the book because it is a very good love story and I think that you could have ended it in other ways but other then me wanting to know what will happen and what will Gale say so that is something I would love to know!!
B000002MFE|5.0|I knew I grew up right when I saw that Clapton is a true inspiration. He has some of the best skills in the blues and on the guitar, he really proved his worth with this CD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the idea having different version of the Bible at hand. You don't need a pen or highlighter, it is all there for you.<br />I would recommend the app to everyone.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie truly gives a wonderful story to it's audience, I loved all the actresses in this movie, even the mean ones.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think that this book was very funny because I read lots of these diary of a Wimpy Kid books and this one is my favorite!YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!!(: -_- $_$  +_+  0_0 <-> °·° °<° °>° funny faces!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie, start to finish, doesn't give the viewer a moment to come to grips with the end of such an epic series. I've read the book and had some moments I wanted to see in the movie, but I understand that the two are separate and enjoy each for their own.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love playing games and this one  you can play relax mode, timed mode it's a great game to play
B001AIRUOU|4.0|Truly, this packaging is incredible. I love Tim Burton films and Jack Skelington's character is one of my favorites. Couldn't be more thrilled with what I got.
B0012UOWBA|3.0|I have not received it yet. But I will let you know when I receive it. It looks like a very good movie.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Don't want to let the epic series go? Neither do I, but the fact that the seventh book was separated into two movies helps me come to terms with the end. Great movie.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Having seen the play on several stages, I find the movie less than the stage productions. For people who track actors the movie may be good but for the actual presentation of Hugo's work in song, I would stick to the stage..
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my best friend and her family.  We watched it with them and we all laughed through the whole movie.  I think it has a great message.  I would recommend this movie to any family.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Song selection is not what I would choose but anything by Andrea Bocelli is wonderful. He was on GMA and did not perform the best songs from the CD. Delete the Elvis hype.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|I think this is one of the best Disney movies ever!  Our whole family enjoys these movies and I know Toy Story will always be a classic.
0345803507|4.0|I was so emotional during this book. I smiled, I cried, and was excited. This one took you on fifty shades of rollercoaster. The book starts with their honeymoon and ends....well you'll just have to read for yourself to see how it ends.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This is a classic movie that our whole family loves and enjoys!  I would recommend it to anyone!  Dick Van Dyke is a very talented man!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Wow! Rush is one of the few \\"older\\" bands that still manages to put out solid music every few years or so. I've been listening to Clockwork Angels since it came out in June of last year. Every song is very good to great, featuring some of their best melodies to date. Geddy's bass playing is at an all time high, while Lifeson creates some memorable riffs and Peart fills in all the rest like the legend he is. One of the most complete albums I have heard by any band. Leave it to Rush to put out one of their best albums 40 years into a career. Anyone giving this less than 4 stars needs some serious help.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|This is a classic that I think every family should have.  I love this movie and it always makes me cry.  It is a great story and I think it is good for kids as it shows the importance of us all being unique and how just because people are different they shouldn't be treated poorly.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've put off doing a review of this book series because I don't think I can summarize how great it is. I'm sure other reviewers have done a better job so I guess I'm adding my review to the mix to keep the overall numbers up.<br /><br />It really is the best dystopian novel I've read in a long, long time. Or novels, plural, I should say. Lots of series ebb and flow, from great to ok and back again. This one stays consistently awesome. Different points of view are given but it doesn't bounce around. Each chapter reminds me of a cliffhanger of good tv. Leaving you dying to find out what happens next.<br /><br />I'm very excited to start reading the next set (Part 6 and 7) and any other Hugh Howey novels.
B001JRB16U|5.0|This is another one of my favorite Disney movies.  You can't go wrong with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke, what a pair.  This is a magical movie with a great message about the importance of family.  The music and choreography are wonderful.  I love so many songs in this movie.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I like the song because of the lyrics. Trilogy has a lot of songs so you get your money's worth even if you don't like every song.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|We love Disney movies and Toy Story 1 & 2 are both awesome movies.  This is a classic that will always be loved by children of all ages.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game ever but theres some bugs to it like upgrades and the leaderboards not opening up but that doesnt really matter its a very good game to play to pass time
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This is a 80's cult classic and teens today can still relate to it.  Watching it brings me back to my teenage years.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a great story that was done with animation that is at the top. This movie is great for kids and adults.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|I have always loved this movie, it is one of my very favorite Disney movies.  It is even better in blu-ray!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved this book! Crazy twist at the end.  I couldn't put down I rad the entire thing in a few days. Wish it would hve been a little longer!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought this movie for a friend and her family and even though we didn't get to watch it personally, her and her four children loved it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is enjoyable and full of surprises. just started playing and am still learning,but will definitely stay with it.
B00322PKBW|3.0|It sounds really loud everytime the second hand changes. It doesn't have the day of the month we are in.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is great.Its such a good game I would deffintly reccomand to someone who liked the first temple run. Good job Imangi Studios keep it up
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|My girl wanted to watch this so we rented it. I didn't think I was gonna like it but ended up liking it, a lot. So much so I bought it. Watched it like 5 times. Not gonna get into the movie cuz everyone has their own taste & some might hate it & some might love it. I loved it. I don't like to recommend movies cuz a movie I might like the next person might hate so you have to see & judge for yourself. But I'm a picky person & it takes a lot to make me like something, & this movie did the job, now it's part of my Blu-Ray collection.
B009AMANBA|5.0|We plunged into Lincoln, four of us, each with a different relationship to Spielberg, Sally Field, and Daniel Day Lewis, and so when we filed out again to John Williams credits music, there were at least 16 and probably 256 mixtures of feeling all told.  We climbed into the car, parked several; blocks away from the busy downtown San Francisco movie palace we were at, and avidly discussed the movie until night fell and the stars broke through the low lying clouds on a warm January night.  The main topic of conversation, how lucky for Abe Lincoln to have Adam Driver to turn to on those cold Washington nights when the war was keeping him up, not to mention the madness of Mary Todd.<br /><br />Adam Driver, who plays \\"Adam\\" on HBO's Girls, plays \\"Samuel Beckwith\\" the lead White House telegraph operator, in Spielberg's LINCOLN.  We wondered first of all why screenwriter Tony Kushner hadn't just called his character \\"Adam\\" too, as his other writers do.  Poor Adam must have had a disconnect when he realized he was going to have to answer to somebody else's name.  Thus when Lincoln brushes his hair fondly, mumbles, \\"Good night, Sam,\\" you can see it in Adam's eyes, he doesn't really know why Lincoln is calling him \\"Sam,\\" it's not registering, his beautiful eyes fill up with puzzlement, just like on Girls, when Hanna won't answer his calls.  One of our party denied it was Adam at all, citing the blond highlights in Sam's hair that glisten in the thousands of gas lamps and sexy candles that brighten up Lincoln's private telegraph office, complete with bed.  \\"Adam isn't blonde,\\" our friend argued.  \\"Well, in the 19th century he was.  Samuel was blond,\\" I countered, believing at the time that \\"Samuel Beckwith\\" was a real-life 19th century communicator, perhaps the inventor of the telegram?  Not knowing then, what I know now, that Kushner and Spielberg had made up the appealing character of Sam, to use him as a sort of yes man slash devoted friend, like Sam in The Lord of the Rings, willing to do anything to get his master out of a jam, like Frodo.  \\"Substitute Lincoln for Frodo,\\" I continued, \\"Sam for Sam, and the war against slavery for the war against Mordor or whatever it was called, and it's working for me.\\"<br /><br />My wife happened to be in the ladies room during Adam's big scene, and we kept waiting for him to come in at the end, but alas no.  His simple act however of<br /><br />(spoiler alert--)<br /><br />Telling someone in Virginia to stash the peace delegation in a shack somewhere--<br /><br />(Spoilers concluded)<br /><br />Changed the whole course of the war--no, not the war, but he caused the 13th amendment to be signed and slavery abolished forever more.  It was the kind of miracle that Adam Driver fans expect of their idol.  That bravery that competence with machinery, and otherwise the dumb look of a man who can't keep it in his pants for very long, and maybe that's why, we speculated (except for the one of us who denied that it was Adam at all) maybe that's why Daniel Day Lewis kept him within arm's reach, to warm his pallet and to bring back the simple joys of boyhood.s, willing to do anything to get his master out of a jam, like Frodo.  \\"Substitute Lincoln for Frodo,\\" I continued, \\"Sam for Sam, and the war against slavery for the war against Mordor or whatever it was called, and it's working for me.\\"<br /><br />My wife happened to be in the ladies room during Adam's big scene, and we kept waiting for him to come in at the end, but alas no.

B009VB9VKY|3.0|I had heard that \\"Magic Mike\\" did not have much of a storyline, so I went into watching it with pretty low expectations. I was shocked that it did at least have some type of plot to follow and was not just two hours of make dancers. It was not a terrible movie, though I do not think it deserves 5 stars.
1936891026|5.0|This is a great book for all those who are working towards something big and extraordinary in their lives. Uncover the habits that translates into resistance to realizing your dreams.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I have read almost all of Nicolas Sparks books. I read this book and watched the movie, they were both very good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it has so many new obstacles than the first one. I reccomend you get this game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed the book alot and are looking forward to the movie.I have read almost all of Nicolas Sparks books
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever cause sooooooooooo much then the first one s cause of the big giant monkey or what ever it is
1401223176|5.0|This is where great artwork meets great story telling. This book is a must own for any fan of the Batman.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Any Game of Thrones fan will love owning a season or two, as it takes so very long for the series to restart and this serves as a way to keep all those unusual names/characters straight!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an awesome. game!!!! Highly addictive. I can't get enough of this game. I have the whole family addicted too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so much fun I play it every day I can I would recommend this game to people of all ages
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I'd give this movie ZERO stars if I could.... Is it Vulgar...yes, is it \\"Madcap\\"...yes...is it Funny?????? NOOOOOOO I got this Blu-ray for free and frankly, I much rather have the 2 hours (or whatever it was) back in my life.<br />The first movie had some funny stuff in it, nothing to go wild about, but this one makes the first movie look like an all time Comedy classic by comparison.  Save your money and your time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the high energy and constant action. Will definitely read the others. This should make a good movie and or movie.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I just barely started using white noise to help my son and I with our sleeping issues. I bought an actual machine for myself, but just before its arrival, I decided I should let my 9-year-old use it. I had been setting it up in my son's room and taking it out to put in my room after he fell asleep. Then by accident I came across this app while looking for something different. This works perfectly for me!  I love it and now I don't need to switch the machine over to my room. I use rainfall the most anyid I haven't noticed any problems with it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game I can play it all day. it is so awesome its better than the first temple run. I can play it for about 5- to 10 minutes
B0091REZMW|5.0|I had this game downloaded on my phone and loved it. I got a Kindle Fire hd for Christmas and downloaded it on here as well and still love it. A good download. . :)
0062206281|3.0|If you are reading these reviews and haven't read the book, I suggest you to read no more. Almost all reviews here have spoilers. People don't know how to write about a book without either telling the whole story, going over what they liked or disliked or giving away the end. They just don't realize that people read these reviews without reading the book.<br /><br />I liked \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" a lot. I think that Barcelona deserved that book. At that time, I thought it was a book that stood by its own, that it was not part of any trilogy. Then we had \\"The Angel's Game\\", which I found a masterpiece. After reading that book I remember when I told myself that Carlos Ruiz Zafon is one one of the best writers of our time. There was some association with \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", but I still could not imagine that it was part of a trilogy.<br /><br />Only with the arrival of \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" is that I realized that I was immersed in a trilogy, something that I avoid the best I can.<br /><br />\\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" could not be as different from Zafon's two previous novels. Instead of the elaborated and embellished prose, we have short sentences in a fast-paced page-turner manipulative thriller remindful of American bestsellers from Dan Brown or Khaled Hosseini. At the beginning it was a kind of letdown, but at the end I was willing to give him the benefit of doubt.<br /><br />I prefer to believe that nothing was deliberate or accidental. Zafon is all about style. I wonder if his master plan is to write a literary symphony that when put in a context could represent the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Is this his motivation?<br /><br />By itself, \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" doesn't mean anything. The previous two books need to be read prior to this one (and probably need to be reread after). 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 stars don't make this book justice. Since we have to give stars to the book, I give 3. A little bit above the average.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Susan Cain's writing is so easy to process and understand, that I found myself thinking that this would be an excellent tool for employers and human resource professionals, to help them understand more about the value that introverts can bring to decision-making teams; and for parents, teachers and others who interact with children to also help them understand the best ways in which to support, guide, and increase the self-esteem of introverted children.  On a different level, I found myself nodding in response to what I was reading, recognizing myself easily, while also feeling both validated and ready to claim the title of introvert. What I had always seen as weaknesses, I now consider strengths. As an introvert, I'm just another 1/3 or 1/2 of the human race, and I have lots to contribute. I no longer feel the need to apologize when I need time away from people to recharge, to think, to process, etc.  I highly recommend this book.
B003ZIXO0C|1.0|I was so disappointed with this DVD. Only played it once, and now it will just gather dust, and probably never see the light of day again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not only hot and heavy but more of a love story than anything.if you are into romance you'll love this series.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This is one of the best Disney/Pixar movies I have ever seen. Has a great moral statement behind it and is very entertaining as well. You will be laughing and crying, and learn something all at the same time. GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so awesome! its better than tje first temple run and it has alot of cool and helpfull  upgrades this game is soo AWESOOME but its a little challanging but thats wat makes it fun
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you enjoy the tv program, do yourself a favor and pick up a few seasons on dvd. You will LAUGH your way thru episode after episode and NO COMMERCIALS! Plus, this is great relaxing viewing if you happen to be home sick with the flu. Just pop in Big Bang and relax! LOVE IT!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really great app. Whenever I go somewhere, this is perfect to pass time! It's not as great as the computer edition, but still meets many standards.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Not only do I watch re-runs on tv, I also like to host my own Big Bang marathons! Love this show and it is wonderful having all the episodes on dvd. LOVE IT!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not stop reading this book, and I can't wait for the movie! Very sad, but a great ending! Though I wish this series wouldn't end but, if it had to, this is the way to do it!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this tv series enough to watch the same episodes over and over and over. And with the DVD ~ you can watch whatever you WANT ~ when you want it! Great entertainment!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|After your read a good book it is hard to find the words that describe what the book really deserves. The Night Circus is so engaging and it makes you full with satisfaction on every page.  I thought of five words that this book deserves although I think they don't make the book justice: MAJESTIC, ENCHANTING, MAGICAL, GRACEFUL, and INTENSE. This is one of the few book I can say I don't like but LOVE and Erin Morgenstern did a wonderful job writing The Night Circus.
B004PR71JC|3.0|It is an OK disc. I liked most of it but, it's not really my music genre to listen to.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Much better than Temple Run. I love the ziplines and  minecars. I also like the fact that there are hills and turns in it.
0764137433|3.0|I have no complaints about the content of this book.  It's pretty comprehensive and you have to get into pretty obscure vocabulary to find verbs that it doesn't include. Unfortunately I found the binding to be very fragile.  I'm pretty gentile on my books, but even so, within the first week I was losing pages all over the place.  Be aware of that and exercise extreme caution when turning pages.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed the sixpence and the character development. The ending was a surprise. I would recommend. This book to everyone.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It is still too complicated for my 5 year old, but for my use it is a bit more cerebral than angry birds.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I had heard the 10,000 hours theory and it intrigued me enough to want to read the book. It's an easy read and makes you think - especially if you want to succeed at something!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a fantastic book, I couldn't put it down.  I fell in love with the characters.  Very well written and enjoyable to read.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|You need to go back to the drawing board Amazon!<br />Can't believe Google wont allow a proper search app on the Kindle Fire HD.
B0072V394E|2.0|no really a good old western but then again<br />Clint Eastwood ruined it for everybody else<br />check it out I thought naw
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I expected this to be some cheesy series with lots of loud music and corny dialogue. Not so. It's more intentional than that. I loved the flash backs to the time the hero spent ship wrecked. It showed a much more naive and entitled young man learning that he has to work and learn to save himself. Later, he is more composed and finely tuned, both mentally and physically. His mother's new husband is also very elegant and composed. The whole cast fits together well, the dialog is good, and there is at least one surprise in every episode. I hope it gets renewed for a season 2.<br /><br />This is the 3rd series from Canada that I've watched. I'll know to check out any Canadian offerings in the future.
030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn's book, Gone Girl, gets relationship dysfunction, a la Jonathan Franzen.  It gets the recession, the young married couples scene, the writers world of New York City,  the TV shows that feed on personal tragedy, and the helplessness of children controlled by narcissistic parents.  It gets a lot.  And more.  Gone girl is a tapestry that we as readers observe slowly at first, and then more and more quickly.  Flynn does something magical that most writers can't: she gets us feeling up close and personal about two complex, intense, and for the most part, unsympathetic characters.  We're intrigued with them.  We care about them.  Hats off to Gillian Flynn.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Great variety of sounds with pretty pictures to match each one.  It's easy to download and install additional sounds from the White Noise blog.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed the first hand account from a professional who has more to lose than any gains he would recieve by being open and honest
B00005UKE0|4.0|Not for me......<br />Enjoyed All Things Must Pass.  It was really for my husband and he has it on his MP3 player.  J
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So glad we could purchase season 2 from Amazon Prime.  We only started watching it last summer during reruns, and were excited to get the opportunity to catch up with season 2 before watching season 3.  Quality was excellent!
0786956291|5.0|So happy it arrived. The package came well wrapped and content sealed. I got 2 so I could pass one to my friends, he's gonna be psyched!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I would rate this at 5 stars because it's fun entertaing and inter active.This game is short and easy to play even little kids can play it.I love the way you have to dodge the flamethrowers and slide under. huge. tree trunks
B003B02O14|3.0|Okay, but not a better Grisham. You have to be very willing to suspend belief to enjoy this story, because so much happens for the sheer purpose of supporting the author's intent, and for absolutely no other reason. In the end, it was very unsatisfying.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I am absolutely in love with this series. And while to say this book disappointed would be a lie, there us so much more that needs to be written. The plot has kind of stalled, but moved sideways enough and in interesting enough directions to maintain my interest. (Vague semi-spoilers ahead)<br />Bran has 3 chapters, but only one huge development that opens hundreds of doors and closes none. Arya's role in the story still isn't clear. Very little excitement occurs at the wall. Kings landing experiences no change until the epilogue. And danaerys has done almost nothing. Most characters who spend times travelling in the beginning of the book still haven't reached their destination by the end. The book wasn't bad, but is in need of a tempo pick-up. To be honest, this book's ending feels like the beginning of something awesome. It simply can not be told in two more books. Tying bran arya danaerys Sam Jaime tyrion and Jon into one story will take a lot of writing. Each POV character rightfully needs another 15 or more chapters to truly resolve this story. This story is awesome and worth reading, but the pessimist in me wonders if it will ever be finished.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This was a good story, but comes across as a way for the author to make a statement. It isn't made heavy-handedly though, and doesn't detract very much. Not one I will re-read, to wait for the movie, but okay.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I purchased the set when it was on special for my husband's Christmas.  Such a good deal!  Blu-ray brings out so many details you don't notice on regular DVDs.  Would definitely recommend!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was an enjoyable Grisham read. Not on par with The Firm, but entertaining, and fairly plausible. I enjoyed it.
075669812X|5.0|11 year old grandson loved this.  He was able to collect one of the characters that he had been looking for that was included with the book.  It was a good buy and kept him reading for hours!

0865479410|4.0|The problem with many self help books and the people that read them is that many people want a quick fix. I do not consider the Antidote to be a self help book but primarily a primer on alternative methods of thinking if the anxieties about your perceived changes in your life or not happening according to plan. From mental affirmations to The Secret to the Law of Attraction - this book is not in the same league as those. Those books offer lists, quizzes, and ways for you to measure your success (by accomplishing it). The Antidote is the Anti-self help book.<br /><br />Many have stated that this book is all about being negative and doom and gloom. I have to disagree with that short sighted assessment. I find Burkeman's willingness to analyze different methods of realistic thinking to be refreshing. One of the most notable ones are his experiences at the meditation retreat. As a parent I can completely understand how your mind can get clouded with so many competing thoughts.<br /><br />Burkeman goes on to discuss not just Buddhist meditation but also Stoicism, the teachings of Albert Ellis, A visit to an African slum and really getting to the meat of what our standards of \\"happiness\\" are. Happiness is subjective and basically this book reminds you about the basics in life. The extras are just additional noise or resources to get you to what your perceived version of happiness is.<br /><br />Failure is the enemy of happiness and the fear of failure can create irrational fears that we spend much of our time preparing for. As Burkeman points out though is if you can get a realistic grip on understanding the consequences and having the confidence that you are prepared to deal with them then you no longer have a fear of failing what you set out to do.<br /><br />Overall good book and a great intro to anyone interested in learning about cognitive behavior, buddhism and the anti-effect of setting goals.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Really fun and addicting. Way more engaging than the first Temple Run, because of the added obstacles and the cave cart riding ( I don't know what it's called but it's fun). Not to mention it's still free, and nothing beats free.
B00991TCOG|5.0|My son put me onto Lindsey Stirling.  Her music is very uplifting and energetic.  It really gets me moving in my workout!
B008X77K8W|5.0|One on his best cds yet. Well written song's and sang with a trueness in his voice as only Chris can do.
B0090XG9T4|5.0|We enjoy watching parts from movies that we grew up with and also movies t hat our parents grew up  with
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I love all of the Jack Reacher series - I've read 14 so far.  They are a little predictable after the first five or six but still very entertaining and even a little educational.  Keep them coming!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I was really expecting so much from this film.  It didn't hold my attention at all; it was very boring.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I like to play games as I unwind to fall asleep. Many white noise programs do not have the ability to run in the background. This one does.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Diverse pieces allow users to manipulate documents of virtually all shades.  I know of no other app which works as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great book.  Could not put it down.  Love the characters and cannot wait to read the rest of the books.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The wife and I laughed and cried our way through this one.<br />It reminded us of our own chance meeting and marrying in four weeks some 37 years ago... The story is spellbinding.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Hello my name is Kylee and I am in 7th grade. My teacher had us read this story and it touched my heart. Although I don't have a mentally effecting diagnosis I do know what its like to be innocently unknowing. This story will play with your emotions!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|It's not an easy thing to have a show with a bunch of characters and for the audience actually care about all of them.  Lots of times you hope a character dies because of poor acting ability like in Babylon 5 or because the character was poorly written like sometimes on some shows I won't mention.  In any case it is the third season and WW1 in over and the days of old are fading.  The continuing storyline of these great characters in a fading era continues with all the conflicts, troubles and joys you would hope for if you liked Season 1 & 2.  I loved Season 3 and and I hope the show goes a few more seasons and into WW2.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game makes me a bit dizzy. I kind of liked the first one better, just an easier format. I do like the power ups in this version but I'm still getting used to it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|this movie rocked the house.  This was one of the best bond films I have seen.  It was practical but not as far as the borne movies.  Everything made sense and important characters died.  Bonds bad guy was (spiller) another 00 like in goldeneye and captured him but did not torture him in the traditional way.  It was great.  I don't want to spoil anything but if you liked Casio Royal you will like this one.  Also (spoiler) Eve (Moneypenny) is finally sexy enough so that you can believe they have or will have sexual tension.  Great Bond movie.  Loved it!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game is as much fun and  gives you some brain exercise  as well.  Come on, try it you know you want to!!
0439023521|2.0|The story is juvenile, but it caught my interest and moved quickly so I read the whole book. But it is so poorly edited that I actually got out my red pencil and started marking it up with proofing marks. I think it is a pity that young people who read this book (it is aimed at teens) will find such a poor example of writing and editing. I cannot recommend this book.
