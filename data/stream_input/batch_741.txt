B000I5YCCO|5.0|Taylor Swift is just absolutely amazing. If you like country music at all then must own this album. Any girl can relate to every song on this CD. I'm 23 and I love it, my mom is 46 and she loves it, and my 7 year old little sister can belt every song at the top of her lungs. This is by far the best CD I've bought in a long time. Now we just need to get Taylor and Dierks on a tour together!!!!
0740748475|5.0|This was a great opportunity, which I'm very glad to have had the chance to take... The books are beautiful, and the edition very well done. In addition Calvin & Hobbes are a master piece. I'm very happy about this product, now I will have ALL the stories of C&H in a compact way, and they will remain with me along my life...
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Now Bourne want to trace his identity all the way back to end the whole mess, what comes after is a non-stop excitement of \\"cat and mouse\\" game which show how smart Bourne is.  This third series won't lack of the usual element in Bourne movie of course - sneak away when dozens of agents are closely monitoring, smart way to get away, close hand-to-hand combat, big jump, crazy car chase, also going places to find out new clues. I also like Nicky Parsons' character, another brilliant agent.  You won't have time to take a break for breathe.
B000YMBBH0|1.0|The product information indicated that all three discs would play on BOTH regular DVD and HD. In fact, only one of the discs had the movie on both sides. The other two only had HD compatible.    After e-mailing Amazon for a replacement, I was informed the product was not available anymore. They did indicate I could return the product for a full refund.    I am quite annoyed by this purchase and will hesitate before buying anything more from Amazon.
1594489505|5.0|I wasnt sure I would enjoy this book at first...BUT the author draws you in and makes you CARE about the characters. I swear I couldnt put it down. Each page brought another emotion. I am going to order his first book now. I think it \\"humanizes\\" the people of Afghanistan in a way many of us have never thought of. We get lost in just the war and the headlines.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I had the chance to see this show twice, and this video really pay's tribute to the effort of all the dancers, musicians and Celine's itself... It was a great treat to see her live, and it's even a better one to have her playing live home whenever I have the chance to turn my DVD on.       BUY IT!
B00000DGRX|5.0|...then this CD is a MUST HAVE!Roger Glover's mixes are awesome...its like  listening to \\"MACHINE HEAD\\" through the Master Bassist own ears...a different take on one of the most prolific rock albums ever recorded & produced.I also appreciate that \\"WHEN A BLIND MAN CRIES\\" is also included on  this 2 disc set.Originally recorded in Switzerland with the original tracks,it was disincluded @ the last minute.I had the distinct pleasure of  seeing DEEP PURPLE in 1973 with their now infamous \\"WALL OF MARSHALLS\\" that  still leaves goosebumps all these years later & earned \\"PURPLE\\" a place in  the Guiness book of records as the world's loudest rock band.Young musicians take heed!...buy this CD,CRANK IT UP & learn what ROCK is   truly all about...JMF
B00065MDSG|5.0|From hypnotic to disturbing, sweet melodies to discordance, has it all. My college son says Easy Money stands the test of time sounding oddly new.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I gave this cd to my dad for his birthday and he loves it!  :)
B000WTNCQS|4.0|Very good, actually more in it then I thought. It is U2 at there Classical Best and Probably defined them as the most International versatile group ever......................  MD -Preston
0345440900|5.0|As a first time mother this book offered great direction on starting and keeping your baby on a schedule.  My husband and I love it and so does our son!  Its also an easy read :-)
1582701709|5.0|I am writing this review for the book, but I have only seen the DVD. I am new: I cannot claim success or failure by following the information presented.    However, I would like to address the negative reviews.     Yes, the information presented is not new and has been around for years. I am especially familiar with Napolean Hill's book \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" Of course there is \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\" I think the authors of these books, and perhaps the book form of \\"The Secret\\" muddle their message with too many examples and too much information.     The DVD form is a bit overproduced---it sounds like an informercial. Of course I realized that there wasn't anything to \\"buy\\" at the end (I had rented the DVD). So the only thing to \\"buy\\" was the information presented.    To all of those who wrote negative reviews, I would challenge you by saying that the book/DVD worked perfectly. You didn't really believe that it would work for you and it didn't. You dismissed the concepts with terms like \\"New Age nonesense\\", \\"psychobabble\\", etc.     For everyone who achieved positive results, I say \\"mais, oui!\\"--but yes.    No doubt there are some who have had mixed results. Keep trying.    As I said in the beginning, I cannot claim success or failure. I do have a simple solid vision in mind. I have a house to sell, and it has been on the market for 4 months. I clearly visualize the \\"Sold\\" sign on the realtor's sign. I am confident that it will sell within the next two months.
B000E0VKXW|5.0|Love the music.  My only complaint is with the packaging.  The CD was not sealed which the vendor says is because it was from another country.  I was giving one as a gift and I was uncomfortable giving an unsealed CD. Also, I ordered 2 CD's and one of the cases was damaged.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Bought this movie from amazon 2 years ago & have watched it all the way through 5 times. I keep re-watching certain scenes, like where Bullseye kills the guy in the Pub with a paperclip. Colin's menacing look is hilarious. It's such a cartoon, over the top crazy. Affleck & Garner are great together. Michael Clarke Duncan is strong. Whenever life is walking all over me, I just watch any scene with Bullseye & laugh my a** off, get back in the groove. I have no idea why this movie didn't sell more tickets. It is a super great presentation of the comic!
B00006D295|1.0|This movie is Horrible!!!   Boring!!!  Ridiculous!!!!   Dont waste your time. And to all the LOVERS of this piece of garbage, Dont be a hater just let me have my opinion.  OH and I don't want to hear from anybody that likes it. Just those that really hate it.. HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!
B0000714B5|1.0|I had read Siddhartha at least 20 times. It is one of the most inspiring books of our times. I was really looking forward to this move. It is the worst movie with absolutely no emotions. Incase you love this book please never watch the movie you will regret it.
B000BCE918|4.0|my son just loves these movies!! and since I get to watch them over and over, I think they are really great too!
1400032717|5.0|There's points in life when you realize that you truly don't understand the way different people think, or why they act certain ways. Maybe you're writing a story about a character who lives in a different time, place, or has a medical condition that simply prevents you from relating to them. You realize, 'Wow! It's important to understand the what others are, how they think, and solve problems!' For me, reading 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time' really emphasized that.    'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time' is a story that profiles an autistic boy named Christopher Boone who tries hard to understand and cope with the world around him. Christopher's father discovers that Christopher had been trying to figure out who killed their neighbor's dog, Wellington, and even worse, writing a book about it. His father takes the book and forbids Christopher to mystery solve any more. When Christopher attempts to get the book back, he comes across secrets about himself, his father and his mother, who has supposedly dead. He rebels against his father and embarks on a journey that would change his life forever.    'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time' expresses that it's important to take time to really understand the way different people are and how they think. Christopher is damaged when his father doesn't comprehend the feelings that Christopher is having. 'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time' is a great book for someone who likes interesting twists and turns, but at the same time explores themes of the world around us, such as religion and death. Mark Haddon writes the book in Christopher's point of view, and seeing as Christopher is a thirteen year old boy with autism, you're in for a wild ride the eyes of a fascinating kid, not to mention a few math problems and diagrams along the way.
0143038419|5.0|I am a yoga teacher and a police officer who has had her share of good and bad relationships. While reading this, so many things related to either a friend or myself...or both.  The humor throughout made it so pleasant to read.  I could not put it down.  I can't wait for the 2nd one and the movie to be released.
1600240526|5.0|We again enjoyed the adventures of Oliver Stone.  We hope this is not the last story since Oliver disappeared at the end.  We look forward to the next installment
0439882826|5.0|This is the most awesome pop up. it has scenes from all six episodes with working lightsabers on the last page featuring Obi-Wan and Anakin. My kids like to get the pages close so they can have a saber fight. The graphics are extremely cool. We love Star Wars stuff and this was very well done! A fun book!
B000VECAEO|5.0|Don't want to think we're gonna have to do without them... They are still so good! The bonuses on these DVDs are irresistible as well!...
075640407X|3.0|I've seen a lot of fuss over this book, but I have to say I didn't find it to match up to the hype. As a temporary diversion, the book served its purpose, but I won't be waiting eagerly for the sequels.<br /><br />The quality of the writing is good, but not enough to offset the tendency of the plot to meander. The most egregious instance of this was the encounter with the dragon that accounts for a significant latter portion of the book-- this has nothing to do with anything! Beyond that, there is nothing significantly different about this book to distinguish it from any other fantasy about a mage warrior springing from rough beginnings.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|If you grew up in the 70s with Springstein's early work, you will really like this CD.  Very nostalgic to listen to and easy to play as background to whatever you are doing without begin the least bit distracting.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|This is a great product. Our kids (girl 7 and boy 9) have played with them at a local discovery museum, and spent a lot of time doing crazy constructions. Teenagers and toddlers were playing too, all of them so focused on their creations (no time and energy wasted looking for the right piece - this is such a great concept: all the pieces are the same)! We got the 200 pieces set, and that seems to be just enough for now...  They also last and don't go out of style : my niece is playing with the set that belonged to her mom!
0446577391|4.0|I enjoy reading political/espionage thrillers for a couple reasons:  (1) I don't know enough about the real life equivalents to catch any mistakes or impossibilities; and (2) I'm cynical enough to believe the CIA might eliminate people who could make life uncomfortable for those in power.  This book has all that plus a homicidal casino owner and his thugs out for revenge.<br /><br />Reading this book is the literary equivalent of watching a blockbuster action movie or watching a show like \\"24.\\"  You start reading the first page and before you know it -- bam! -- you're off and running, reading as fast as you can to see what happens next.  Nobody expects it to be great literature or that you'll want to savor each turn of the phrase.  It's just great fun and entertainment.<br /><br />Oliver Stone and the other members of his little club are back along with Alex Ford & Annabelle Conroy.  I enjoyed The Camel Club and The Collectors but someone who has not read them will still be able to follow and enjoy this book.<br /><br />A few of the plot twists made me sad (and wonder if this is the end of the Camel Club books) but overall it was a fun way to escape a dreary winter weekend.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|This collection was worth the wait. I hadn't seen Rocky VI yet and I only owned 1 & 2 on VHS from years ago. The packaging is simple,but sweet. There is no mystery behind Rocky...you know exactly what your getting. People are upset as if they expected more. All the DVD's are in DTS 5.1 and look and sound great. Rocky 6 was suprisingly good. In order of best to worst Rocky movies: 1,2,4,3,6,5.    To be honest, who actually watches all that extra commentary and interview stuff anyway? I just want the movies!     A great package at a great price.
1582701709|5.0|[[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]]  I was very impressed with the speed, the condition of which I recieved this order! I recieved it in less than a week and the books were in impecable condition and the shipping was free! I will order from Amazon again!
B0001HAISQ|5.0|My daughter loves this movie and has been asking for it for a while, checking local stores I was surprised to see it priced higher than in Amazon.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|If you like the Eagles you will LOVE this concert and interview footage. On a 5.1 surround system it's just like being there. Remember how good they were 25-30 years ago? I swear they are even better NOW. As close to perfect as a group can get. Buy this DVD set and treasure it.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is probably my all time favorite Disney animated film so far.  I love to cook and so that is probably why I love it so much.  The movie is very clever too.  I recommend it to everyone!
032147404X|5.0|The book was well written and easy to understand. I finished it in just a couple sittings. Reading it was well worth my time. Infact I already preordered his Volume 2 book.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Having purchased Planet Earth for my adult son for Christmas, I had thought that I probably wouldn't get to see it, but a few days after the holidays, he brought the cd's to my house to share. The photography is amazing, as is the color and the content!  My wish to the world is to make seeing the world  in a different way a requirement.  Schools could use the videos to promote ecology and awareness of the world around us.  Strangely, our dog plopped himself on the sofa and didn't take his eyes off the screen for an hour! I'm looking forward to seeing the next session soon.
0894803123|5.0|This book was bought as a Christmas gift, but I liked it so much that I kept one copy. The entire book is illustrated and fun to browse through. The perfect gift for anyone who loves ice cream, but especially a teenager or young adult who would enjoy reading it as well as using it.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is an excellent product if you are a LOST fan.     This will allow you to get \\"caught up\\" in one or two weekends.     We had friends over for \\"Lost Weekends\\" actually.     The bonus features leave something to be desired, but there are some surprising facts that I didn't know on them.     I highly recommend this product and would buy it again.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Friendship through music. This is going to be one of those films I know I'll watch again and again. Or at least I'll listen to it . . . the music is so good, it's haunting. Chalk full of emotion, the lyrics and both the male and female voices have a transcending quality that stops you in your tracks and insists you listen.<br /><br />The characters (guy and girl) are understated, modest, and very real. There doesn't seem to be any acting going on, but it's a little like a documentary. He, the guy, is a guitarist, a singer-songwriter, singing for his supper in the off-hours of his job as a vacuum cleaner repairman. She, the girl, is Czech, a pianist, likes his music and happens to have a \\"Hoover\\" in need of repair. He sings on the streets, she sells flowers on the streets. Their ultimate meeting is not remarkable, but their unlikely coupling as a musical duo is. When they first sing together, there's immediate harmony. With the girl as muse, they find their way down a musical path and as I watched, I felt that no matter what was going to happen, everything about the film felt successful. It had a hand-made quality to it that felt believable.<br /><br />Shot mainly on the recognizable streets of Dublin, it's all very Irish and utterly charming. Highly recommend.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
0439882826|5.0|My sons are big SW's fans; they each received this book and love it. It was the envy of many fans from their work places. THANKS!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This CD is a wonderful break from her mass commercialism.  I still feel she has one of the most powerful voices that have come from the American Idol competition. She was definitely the type of person that competition was designed for.  Since winning, we have seen her really bloom under the tutelage of those around her.  While she is not receiving much commercial critical success with this album, i believe it truly shows where she's coming from and that she has something to say.  She's a strong woman with strong views and us other strong women want to hear what she has to say.  This album reminds me of rock the way it was made back in the late 70s and early 80s.
0375847227|5.0|So sorry for the delay in my review.  My purchase was a Christmas gift for my grandson.  He was ecstatic when he opened it up and started reading it right away.  Thank you for such fast & friendly service and for helping me make one 10 y/o boy very happy!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Upon viewing the opening of the series, you are fully immersed into the wonderful nature within this great planet of ours. From the songful sounds to the vibrant colors of the many areas on this planet, this series gives a different perspective of what is out there to enjoy. I would suggest this to anyone who would enjoy the many spendors of life and nature within this planet of ours.     As for the choice of HD or standard editions - I suggest buying the HD edition as there is a major difference in sound and picture. HD makes you feel as if you're watching this on the big screen and that you are surrounded by nature itself.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B0009FU0ZQ Stone Cold]] I can;t actually speak for the product itself because it was a gift but the service and ease of ordering was exceptional. Go Amazon!!
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Great CD - not your typical Christmas album but enough tradition to satisfy most.  Her unique arraingements are beautiful and captivating.  \\"River\\" and \\"Wintersong\\" make me want to listen to this CD all year long.
B000FVE3A2|5.0|INVICTA DIVERS WATCH.  THE PERFECT DIVE WATCH, I'VE RECIVED A LOT OF PRAISE FOR THIS WATCH AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you don't know what you're missing. If you don't own it buy it now!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Absolute a fantastic recording of a great concert of the best band ever. Great sound en fantastic stage effects. You won't be bored for a second watching this recording. An absolute \\"must have\\" for any serious Pink Floyd fan.
B000HKCRW2|5.0|this was my 2007 staple.  the best dance album of 2007.  front to back all great songs.
0316166685|4.0|This novel was one of the most tragic and joyous literary triumphs that I have yet to experience. I found it amazing that the cruelty that is apparent in the text does not alter the beauty that the main character finds in the world. Despite her death wiping her from existence, she deals with her afterlife with care and becomes captivated with those that are still living. I did find problems with the text when it comes to her murderer eluding the police and continuing to to extinguish other young lives. But I found respect for the greater justice that takes place with her killer's death. This book is a quick read that both frustrates and amazes the readers. It is guaranteed to make the viewer smile just much as it makes them cry.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great group of stories that will hold your attention the whole way through the epic.It makes a great gift too.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|These movies have been in my collection since video days.  Always a good story to watch in sequence.  This set made that easier!  I needed the third movie on DVD, and this was reasonable enough to buy the entire set. Watched it straight through within a few days when I got it, and enjoyed it immensely, even the 4th movie which is the Next Karate Kid.  Didn't realize that it was a young Hilary Swank playing the young girls part.  She did a great job, and Pat Morita is always wonderful!  Go Ralph Machio, I love the story line how he is trying so hard to do what is right, and life in general just isn't giving him a break!  But good wins out in the end!
0740748475|5.0|I bought this collection when it was 1/2 off for one day only. I had always wanted it, but always decided the retail rate was too much. This is a great collection of some of the greatest comic strips ever made.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This  makes a great gift for someone, whether they have seen the series or not. It comes in HD as well, which I highly recommend if you have an HD player. I gave this to my mother for Christmas and when some of us watched it, we laughed, carried on, and enjoyed ourselves so much that my dad emerged from his back room to see what we were watching. He loves it too. I was furious, however, to find out that this version is not narrated by Sigourney Weaver, whom I loved in the Discovery Channel version that they show in the States. If you want that version, go to Discovery Channel to buy it, Amazon doesn't seem to offer it. But the narrator for this BBC version is wonderful as well.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Having first seen a small documentary on the making of the soundtrack I knew in advance that George Martin was personally involved in this first-ever remixing of Beatle's classics. Otherwise, I might never have even listened: there's been a disturbing tendency to re-contextualize the Beatles music.     This is a loving & respectful remix. There are deeply touching moments & flashes of the brilliance & fresh outlook one expects of George Martin. I will listen to it often.     For those who love the Beatles, especially those of us who grew up with them, this remix will offer delight.
0143038419|5.0|Can't say anything that hasn't been said. If you are a woman, or if you love a woman, read this book.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Haven't had time to watch it this season, but it one of our favorites to make it a good Christmas.
B000WZB944|5.0|I totally love this new remastered CD.U2 stand the test of time and are truely legends.Well worth the money and thanks to Amazon,shipment was fast as usual. Great product and great service,a rare combo these days.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|I bought the CD for Love Song, because it has become a favorite in my family, but I also enjoyed a lot of her other songs. But I suppose it would be more to the likings of poets and others who enjoy soft music, great piano playing, and meaningful lyrics. It's great music, fun to sing along to, if your that kind of person.
0439882826|4.0|I bought this book for my son for christmas. He is a \\"jedi in training\\" and loves it.  My only concern is how fragile the pop up's are, but I knew that going into the purchase.  It is an incredible book with so much detail. My sons favorite page is the lighted up light sabers of course! I also bought the Naria pop up book too. Both books are great just fragile. Perfect for any Star Wars fan.
B000CNESU8|5.0|This movie totally rocks, I suggest it to any movie lover.  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it!!!!
B0007QJ1MU|5.0|Amazing CD. Not quite as good as Songs for the Deaf, but all of QOTSA starts at amazing and just gets better from there. A complete album, no tracks are fillers, all amazing. To newer QOTSA fans more into metal, I would suggest Songs for the Deaf, Anyone who has heard QOTSA before, and likes songs more in the style of Mosquito Song and maybe God is in the Radio I would suggest this. Also, one bonus is that this \\"edited\\" version is actually ammended. Songs are clean versions, not beeped out like in SFTD. Would highly recommend any QOTSa to any fan of rock (all genres).
0894803123|5.0|The recipes in here are true to the Ben & Jerry's products you find on the frozen section of your grocery store! I easily achieved amazing results with the recipes they provided. (Try the Peanut Butter Fudge Ribbon variation- you will not believe it!). This book is very pratical and written with great humour.    I strongly recommend this book to the novice with a sense of adventure as well as for the more experienced Ice Cream epicurian.    Sincerely.  Blanche, Montreal QC
B000YMBBH0|1.0|Make sure you have a true HD DVD player, otherwise the machine cannot play these DVD's.  I thought my DVD was HD, but it was not.  I mistakenly thought that it would still play the DVD, just not in HD mode.  Wrong.  Machine cannot read disc unless it is HD.  Had to send them back.
0439882826|5.0|My son received this for christmas. He loves it. The pop ups in it are very cool. My husband even loved it. The light sabers in the back was my sons favorite part.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Arrived on time, free shipping and significantly lower price that what the stores were charging around the holidays.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Interesting that I should title this effort, Don't miss out on TV at it's best, since I hardly ever watch an over the air TV program.  I do watch a lot of programs purchased off the shelf and this one is a winner.  The most inconvenient part of LOST is the wait for the next year to be released.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Arrived on time with free shipping.  It was a gift for my father-in-law who loves the Eagles.  He absolutely loved it.  We couldn't buy this particular DVD anywhere local.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This movie is great on Blu-ray.  I absolutely love this movie.  It is hilarious and gets funnier each time I watch it.  Everyone laughs when watching it.
0439882826|5.0|After seeing the authors of these wonderful pop-up books on Martha Stewart, I sent this to my son (and another different one to my daughter-in-law.)  The authors said that only a half million of these books had been made.  I don't know if that's strickly true but I sent it to my son because he collects Star Wars collectibles.  He is very picky but he told me he loved every page.  Yes I know, I am his mother.  I have only paged through it at a local store, the price here was so much better.  I love gifting books.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is really fun and easy to learn.  It is a nice change from video games!  Our 15 year old plays it with her 78 year old grandmother!!
B000VNMMPM|4.0|With Angel-A, Luc Besson, the French director who has created films as diverse as The Professional and The Fifth Element, has made an engagingly quirky film about love and redemption.  Though put together from the elements of several movie clich&eacute;s, this is a surprisingly original portrayal of an unlikely relationship between a down-and-out street character named Andre and a mysterious beauty named Angela. This strikingly shot black and white film also shows us a grittier Paris than is usually shown in movies.<br /><br />Besson has the knack for putting together diverse moods and atmospheres; Angel-A manages to be a hard-edged tale of life on the streets, a romantic comedy and a fantasy all at once. Much of the dialog between Andre and Angela is comical, but with serious undertones, as, early in the film, when the two are both planning to commit suicide by jumping from a bridge. Considering the title, I don't think it's giving away too much to say that Angela may be a real angel. Now Hollywood has done countless movies about humans meeting angels, but Angel-A packs some unusually insightful and intense emotions and ideas about love and the meaning of life into this often insipid genre. The French tendency to instill existentialist themes into movies works well here, helped by making Angel-A a character with a real personality and deep feelings and not a typically bland and silly movie angel. This is a small but very interesting and enjoyable film, helped by great performances by Jamel Debbouze (Andre) and Rie Rasmussen (Angela).
B000VBP382|5.0|I love this special collector's edition of Pride and Prejudice. It is beautifully presented. My favourite part is the book included showing behind the scenes. It is a must have for all lovers of Pride and Prejudice. I already own four copies of this beautiful adaptation but wanted to have this very special collectors edition to add to my collection of all things Jane Austen.
038572179X|5.0|I have tried to read McEwan's books in the past and not been successful.  My feelings about \\"The Atonement\\" are completely different.  This book leads one along from segment to segment through a story which starts in 1935 and ends years later in 1999.  It is about the misunderstandings and lies which lead to individuals leading completely different lives than they might have lived.  Many people have lived through a \\"what if\\" process when things go slightly wrong with their life, wondering how their life might have been different if they had done this or that instead.  Perhaps this recognition is what makes this story so good.  I find myself cribbing minutes here and there to read yet another line or paragraph.  I highly recommend this book and, because of it have gone ahead and purchased McEwan's book \\"Amsterdam\\" as my next read.
0143038419|5.0|Loved the book, and I am not an avid reader, but I felt like I was on the journey with the author.
0143038419|4.0|Yes, Elizabeth Gilbert is a privileged and self-obsessed woman, but \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is a pretty entertaining read, like a book-length version of Oprah Magazine. I enjoyed her very personal and specific takes on Italy and Bali, and her personal drama will resonate with a very lucky few--those who suffer from too much money, too many choices and the exhaustion of jumping from one fabulous man to another (in New York?). Just skip the entire \\"Pray\\" section--it's pretty insufferable and hopelessly starry-eyed about the entire religio-industrial complex of yogic ashrams in India. There's also suspiciously wise Texan who sounds like a canned hybrid of Morgan Freeman and Yoda. Since Gilbert spends the entire Pray section in one place, you'd better really love her as a character to take on that 100 pages, and I didn't. But in all, it's a fun, easy read for a snowy/rainy afternoon.  And to all you housewife haters out there: Just because you ended up saddled with a boring hubby, no-neck monsters and a mortgage doesn't mean everybody else has to flush their lives down the toilet. Leave Gilbert alone!

B00000IQW3|3.0|The acting is passable, the effects are old school, and you know that the hero is going to win the day and get the girl. All this and I still like the whole thing. Great to watch with kids. Robert Preston steals all the scenes that hes in, what a bargain for your entertainment dollar.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|Part one of this production is a pleasure. It is a faithful and sparkling adaptation.  Unfortunately, you will regret having watched the first part after viewing part two. It is a disappointment.  The pace is off.  The changes they make to Bronte's story do nothing to add to the drama or to move the story forward.  They simply flatten the original.  To be sure, the changes appear small.  However, suspense and dramatic tension are created through small, significant , sharply focused moments.  Part two loses these in favor of bland romantic notions.  One by one, my household of boys joined me in watching part one.  They loved it.  They were hooked on Jane Eyre.  Part two left us all wondering what happened.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater with a friend and we loved it so I bought the DVD to give to my mom who doesn't go to theaters.  This is a \\"sweet\\" movie.  It's romatic and sad with a happy ending but it is well acted and the scenery takes your breath away.  It is a beautiful movie to watch and a good story too.

B000MR9D5E|4.0|In this film, one can see snap shots of a number of rare and near extinct animals.  BBC has utilized this opportunity to emphasize how human activities has endangered all sort of living organisms on earth.  This message is loud and clear.  It is a fabolous film to show during family gathering or to be used as educational tool for kids.<br /><br />Different chapters are organized by habitates: deserts, rainforest, tundra, poles, caves...etc.  This organization allows the DVD to merge the knowledge of animals together with knowledge of geograhy into one relatively coherent film.  It might be a bit hard for kids to follow and to absorb 100% of material though.<br /><br />I appreciate and the seperate part of documentation that details the challenges the crew faced.  The script in this part is a bit too hard sell for my taste, hence one less star.<br /><br />Haven't view the discovery channel or national geography films that are similar, so no comment about which one is better.  However, with this one alone, I highly recommend this, especially if you have a high definition TV.

I've been bringing these incredible treats into work for my co-workers each week and they always receive raves from non vegans who also ask for the recipe. The raspberry oat bars, chocolate chip cookies, carrot cake, chocolate cake, just to name a few of the items I've sampled are amazing. Bravo Colleen for creating such a fantastic vegan cookbook!

B000VSBX34|5.0|1965, It was the Beatles and James Bond, both competing for the pop culture dollar. Just as in 1956 you had Elvis and Davey Crockett, squaring off for the entertainment dollar. In '65 Goldfinger and 007 were all the rage and The Beatles who were invincible up until then were facing off against The upstart Rolling Stones, The California cool Beach Boys and Motown wonders The Supremes. So how did the Liverpool Lads counter?...Brilliantly of course.     First you take a half-baked sort of spy-like, espionge story-line. You incorporate some silly slap stick routines and you round it out with an outstanding selection of orginal songs...and....Walla!!!!! What have you got?...Why a pop cultue phenomenon that has outlasted the Hoola Hoop, The Nehru Suit, The Love In and I dare say even Davey Crockett himself.    But if it were only that easy.... Then again, it all seems so easy in the capable hands of the The Fab Four. Afterall, true talent will always prevail. And so we have HELP. I don't think you need any further analysis to conclude that HELP truly was and always will be a pop culture milestone. Surfice to say... \\"When I was young I never needed anyone\\"...Anyone that is except The Beatles. Forty plus years later, that still hasn't changed, Yes I can live in a world without James Bond, Davey Crockett, The Rolling Stones and the like. But even at fifty seven years old I couldn't bear to live in a world without The Beatles...\\"Help! I Need Someone...No Not Just Anyone\\"....\\"Help\\"...I Need The BEATLES!!!!

B000Y7U98C|4.0|Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later) re-unites with his 28 Days Later team of writer Alex Garland, producer Andrew MacDonald, and star Cillian Murphy, for this visually stunning, criminally underrated sci-fi opus.  Murphy is among a crew of scientists and astronauts (which also includes Chris \\"Human Torch\\" Evans, Rose Byrne of FX's Damages, Michelle Yeoh, and Cliff Curtis) on a mission to re-ignite the dying sun as Earth is gripped in a solar winter.  Along the way there, a variety of hazards are presented, which ultimately ends in a surprise and horrific discovery.  For two-thirds of Sunshine's running time, the film is an intelligent and gripping blend of science fact, fiction, and probability, but by the time the film reaches its final act, it degenerates into a slasher film.  This in itself isn't so bad, but the potential for something really special was huge here.  Regardless, Sunshine remains a more than worthwhile science fiction yarn that manages to go against the typical conventions of the genre for a majority of its running time, and it is another fine film to come from director Danny Boyle.
0143038419|1.0|It was the worst book that I read in 2007. I am very happy that I borrowed it from the public library. Ms. Gilbert came across as an immature woman who could never fully comprehend the overall ramifications of her personal actions. I quit reading this book after page 50.

B000W07EKW|5.0|The general trend is that by the 3rd installment everyone has lost interest, from the actors to the audience (just go and watch Pirates OTC 3). Not so with the Bourne series. I think the difference is that they kept it to the point. These are action films and only action films. Very little of any thing else crept in. Romance was kept to the first one, instead of a new conquest for each. No comic relief. Just good old fashioned none stop action. In fact if you have a heart problem the fight scene with the reporter, in Ultimatum, might do you in. ;-)    It was also nice that the was very little cursing and nothing explicit in the sexual arena, just implied in the first movie only and the violence was not unnecessarily graphic. I could watch it with my teens comfortably.    The set was also put together nicely, the bank deposit DVD case and passport were nice touches.    Enjoy
0783225547|5.0|This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies. The music and effects are great, they keep you right on the edge of your seat. If you haven't seen this movie, at least rent it.
0790744295|5.0|This is the best of all presentation of selected Stephen King's short stories. After viewing it at least 12 times, I still love it.  Some of the lines have become family phrases, such as \\"Meteor s___!\\" and \\"What would you do without me, Henry?\\"  The outstanding actors are outstanding.  Creepshow is a great addition to your King library.

B000002B30|5.0|Anytime a major artist releases a CD labeled \\"Greatest Hits,\\" all bets are off!  There will always be disagreements over what is (or should be) on the CD.  Surely no difference here, as one can see from the variety of reviews already posted.<br /><br />However, my own sense is that this is not a bad collection of Springsteen's hits.  It opens with a song that helped propel him to greater fame and renown than previously--\\"Born to Run.\\"  One of the best rock songs around (and one nice aspect of this CD is that the lyrics show up, so that people can see the actual words of the songs).  Other top notch songs appear on this CD:  \\"Thunder Road,\\" \\"Badlands,\\" \\"Hungry Heart,\\" \\"Dancing in the Dark,\\" \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" and so on.<br /><br />The collection captures the range of Springsteen's work, from the hard rockers to more introspective songs, from the sound of the E Street Band joining him to sparer instrumentation.<br /><br />Questions?  Sure.  Nothing earlier than \\"Born to Run\\"?  There were some very nice pieces before that iconic tune.  Also, I could see other songs as candidates for inclusion--\\"10th Avenue Freezeout,\\" \\"Jungleland,\\" and so on.  Nonetheless, this works well as a Greatest Hits compilation for Bruce Springsteen.  Fans may have all his CDs, but it's sometimes nice to have a compilation available of some of the best works available. And if you don't have a lot of Springsteen's works, then this is \\"must hear music.\\"
0345479092|5.0|This is the most comprehensive book I have seen on taking care of your new baby.  There are tables with information like how to tell if your baby is tired, what to do when he/she is overtired, and other practical things.  The book has great information on avoiding trouble spots, like the baby being dependant on being carried or driven around in the car to sleep.  I used this book myself and bought it for several friends who are having their first or who had a hard time with their first and are on their second.

B000VSBX34|5.0|It's about time!  This classic took forever to come out on DVD but now that it's here it is better than ever.  The sound and color have been restored and the DVD is great!  My daughter did not believe me when I told her this film is 42 years old.  She thought it was a recent picture!  The boys are classic clowns having a fantastic spell. \\"Just so natural. And still the same as they was before they was.\\"  Great tunes that bring back memories of a peaceful, fun-loving time.      The box includes a 2nd disc with the story behind the restoration process as well as memories from the cast and crew, movie trailers, etc.  Very interesting.    Overall, Help! is a great fun film and it could, \\"dare we say it?--rule the world!\\"  A must for any Beatle fan.    \\"To the Temple!\\"
B000YPUF9W|4.0|Zombie Crows.. thats too cool. and (milla) is not just packing guns this time but full on Psionics! which I thought was done well and the acting this time was a step up in my opinion. I really enjoyed the whole zombie crow sequence. can you tell? anyway doctor Isaacs has gone quite mad with power (no loony hive computer yay) and after a nasty lot of experiments, he does the unthinkable after having been bitten by a \\"super zombie\\" and injects himself with Alice's (Milla) Blood and the T-Cell virus. you can guess what transpires from here.<br />this film was well done and I am not a big fan of the games but have a few friends whom are and they agree with me that this is by far the best resident evil installment to date.<br />Oded fehr is also worthy of note. he is a very good actor from the series charmed (played the demon Zankou) also worthy of note from the tv series Heroes Ali Larter as Claire Redfield and a good choice for a tough woman role. although the acting is not without flaw as with the story, but, it is an entertaining film, and that's what it's about isn't it?<br />I'd have awarded 3 3/4 stars but I prefer rounding up in this case so 4 stars for RE!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|If you haven't heard the CD or seen the movie, I highly recomend both. Eddie Vedder did an awesome job with the sound track!
B000OCY7JE|4.0|A Danish orphanage worker outside Mumbai, India, is summoned home to receive a large donation from a wealthy industrialist in this intensely acted 2006 drama that seamlessly melds Douglas Sirk's hyperbolic melodramas with Ingmar Bergman's more austere sensibilities. Directed with panache by Susanne Bier, the result is really an involving soap opera given greater texture and surprising plot turns by Anders Thomas Jensen' dexterous screenplay. 2006 was obviously a fertile year for world cinema as this emotionally vibrant film competed against Guillermo del Toro's Gothic fairy tale [[ASIN:B000O76ZQC Pan's Labyrinth]] and the winner, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Cold War thriller [[ASIN:B000OVLBGC The Lives of Others]], for the 2006 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.<br /><br />The story's protagonist is Jacob Peterson, a taciturn man dedicated to the orphanage he runs in India, so much so that coming back to Denmark holds little interest for him other than securing the funding he needs from a multinational corporation headquartered in Copenhagen. The seemingly avuncular CEO Jørgen Hansson just wants to shake Jacob's hand for his humanitarian work. When Jacob arrives, however, it becomes clear that Jørgen hasn't quite made up his mind about the gift much to Jacob's consternation. It seems like a good omen when Jørgen invites Jacob to his daughter Anna's lavish wedding at his palatial home, but then Jacob meets Jørgen's comely wife Helene, who turns out to have known Jacob years before. The story peels off one revelation after another, sometimes with subtlety and other times with the forceful contrivance of a sledgehammer. Each of the major story developments hinges on a secret that a principal character is forced to reveal, most often with devastating consequences.<br /><br />Looking a bit like Viggo Mortenson's recessive brother, Mads Mikkelsen (almost unrecognizable as the nasty banker Le Chiffre in [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale]]) portrays Jacob with haunting power, though sometimes the character is presented too elliptically for Mikkelsen to flesh out effectively. For instance, we don't get a deep sense of his inner struggle over saving thousands of children in India since he lets his pride stand in the way when it becomes convenient to the plot. Rolf Lassgard manages to capture the bluster and increasing desperation of a man used to having his way but unable to cope with the inevitable. When his character's motivations are slowly revealed, his performance starts to unravel into excess, especially in a no-holds-barred breakdown scene toward the end. As the wife with the complicated past, Sidse Babett Knudsen is genuinely affecting, as is Stine Fischer Christensen as the waif-like daughter caught in the middle.<br /><br />Bier's idiosyncratic filmmaking style can be seen in the unexpected jump cuts and the heavy use of close-ups on the actors' eyes during the most tense and cathartic moments. The 2007 DVD is sparse on extras. Neither a commentary track nor a making-of featurette are included, but there is a reasonably insightful twenty-minute interview with Bier conducted by Danish film critic Morten Piil. Also included are the theatrical trailer and eight deleted scenes which Bier explains to Piil were cut because they either detracted from the main storyline or made a redundant plot point with little additional benefit. Looking at them after seeing the film, I would agree with her assessment. It's a very well crafted piece of work and certainly provides enough dramatic fireworks and moments of true insight to make this worthwhile viewing despite the occasional plot contrivance.ough sometimes the character is presented too elliptically for Mikkelsen to flesh out effectively.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|I thought this movie was a great family movie.  The director really showed the audience that moving around in someone else's world can really be a joy.  And this movie while it had it's hard times... it ultimately gives the audience a feeling of hope and joy in the simplest of things in life... whether someone takes pleasure in weeding the garden or drawing pictures for children or strolling through the park... life has many pleasures that aren't complicated.      Ewan's mustache is missing from the cover... but in the ENTIRE movie he has one.   Odd?  Maybe they did that to let people recognize him better on the cover???

0684135051|2.0|I ordered this with very high hopes because of all the praise E. Zimmerman gets for her books. I was expecially interested in her because I've read so much about how crystal clear her explanations are and that this book in particular contains so many pearls of wisdom re: circular knitting. I have been trying without success to learn to knit with DPNs and hoped I'd find the key here. All I found was frustration. After an initial surge of hope when I found the section entitled \\"Circular Needles\\", and reading through an unnecessary mini-treatise on why some people dislike using them, came the words \\"Younger people love circular knitting....but suffer under a great paucity of directions for the technique. This gap I am valiantly trying to fill\\". I read on, certain the she meant to fill that gap. She did not. There was another page or so of miscellaneous tips and info about the needles themselves but not a word there or elsewhere about circular knitting. And not a word about technique for knitting on DPNs. Illustrations are sparse, photos all in B&W, so if you are a visual learner, this is not for you. I was also eager to find the pattern for the much touted baby jacket, but found nothing like what I've read about. But maybe that's the Modular Tomten Jacket? I'm going to give it a try. My biggest gripe in general about this book is that she goes into excruciating detail about the most useless stuff and skips over details that are important to beginners. And this is supposed to be a book for beginners, right? That said, the section on gauge is very good, and I like that she explains the rudiments of knitting design so that you understand how to either customize patterns you have, or design your own if you're ambitious enough. And one thing that she does describe under the heading of ski sweater, is a method whereby you cut the body of a sweater to make an armhole to fit a sleeve into. I'm not sure what the advantage is, and she doesn't say, but I haven't seen that technique described elsewhere, so that was interesting. It may be some time before I'm brave enough to try that, however. All in all, I would not say I didn't get my money's worth. After all, I got it on sale. A little less chit chat and more info would make this more satisfying. For instance, she does not tell the reader how to follow a chart. She just gives one and tells you to \\"refer to the chart\\". Ditto for Fair Isle knitting. Maybe when I have a little more experience under my belt, this will seem more useful. In the meantime, I'll continue my search for a true beginner book.

0740748475|4.0|While the Calvin and Hobbes collection is great, unfortunately the 'binding' utilized for this collection is mediocre to poor.  Pages appear to be glued to the spine of the cardboard book covers - the leather graining looks nice, but don't let the pictures fool you.    I got these from Amazon dirt cheap and did not expect them to be truly leather-bound and library quality.  If you love Calvin and Hobbes, and keep in mind that these are not hundreds and hundreds of dollars in price, you'll enjoy them very much.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I'm intrigued by the number of Amazon reviews of this album that claim it is unlistenable noise, made up predominantly of synthetic sounds... I can only imagine these people bought the CD, skipped straight to track 3 (\\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\"), then pressed stop and started writing their review.    Because aside from that track, Amnesiac is an album full of highly melodic pieces. Yes there are some electronic elements present but they are sparingly used. Maybe some of these people were longing for the guitars that dominated The Bends and OK Computer? Mind you guitars are all over tracks like \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"I Might Be Wrong\\". And believe it or not folks, pianos, strings and horns are real instruments too!    A lot has been made of the fact that Amnesiac is leftovers from Kid A. I've got to say that when I first heard the album I was unaware of this fact, and quite frankly it's irrelevant - all I heard was a great set of music.    After the simple but effective opener (curiously titled \\"Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box\\") comes the slow off-kilter piano of \\"Pyramid Song\\", almost worth the price of admission alone. The aforementioned \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" are straight-forward guitar-based songs that even the rockiest Radiohead fans can enjoy. And despite the electronics, \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" is probably one of the most beautiful songs the band has ever done. If the blips and blops really bother you I recommend checking out the live version, played on acoustic piano.    As others have mentioned, it probably isn't that necessary to have another version of \\"Morning Bell\\", though it is quite beautiful, and a very different version to that on Kid A. Similarly, \\"Hunting Bears\\" (which is a solo guitar reprise of \\"I Might Be Wrong\\") is not exactly essential, though it explores some interesting sounds and it's nice to hear that melody in a different context.    So when all's said and done, I'm still (or perhaps even a little more) puzzled by all thenegative reviews. Yes I'll admit that \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" is pretty odd and I might skip it on occasion. But apart from that we have 10 great tracks, which are highly listenable and flow remarkably well. 5 stars.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|I saw the original many times \\"back in the day\\" and they did a great job cleaning up the images and the quality of the sound (5.1). It was great to re-vist this rock classic.

The director's cut added two new scenes I've never scene before, and it was wonderful not to watch the movie and be able to quote all the lines as they are said.<br /><br />The extended scenes include<br /><br />-- More dialog between Kirk and McCoy at Kirk's home.<br />-- Kirk's bantering with Peter Preston in the engineering room.<br />-- McCoy's dialog with Kirk after Preston dies.<br />-- The human ego comment by Spock.<br /><br />I'm sure there was some more, but these are what stand out.  The first and the third items were great, and I can't figure out why they were cut out.  I had seen the 2nd and 4th items before when the show aired on TV.  However, I think the timing was different with the human ego line on the TV version.  Here it happens before Kirk calls Khan out for a rematch.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a nice DVD collection.  Unlike some reviewers, I found the color and presentation to be excellent.  Not as amazing as the first movies director's cut, but then again...this one wasn't in such need to fixing to begin with.
B0001RVQM8|3.0|My wife and I heard Jonathan Biss recently perform with The Cleveland Orchestra.  We thought his performance was outstanding.  Thus my desire to purchase this CD.  I am disappointed, however, with the CD.  Good, but not extraordinary.  Too much pedal, runs not precise in some cases.  I would think he and his agent would not want to muddy his image by distributing performances that are not as good as he can be.
B00005LOLD|5.0|Being involved in an American/Japanese relationship myself, I am a bit of a sucker for this kind of flick.  It is always nice to see something of your own life on the screen, to see things that you can empathize with and maybe show to other people so that they can understand the difficulties, prejudice and deep cultural divides that one must overcome when dealing with international romance.  My partner and I both agree that \\"Sayonara\\" is one of the best, in that it respects both sides of relationship, without presenting one culture as \\"normal\\" and one as \\"bizarre\\", which is what most typically happens.  The racism and hatred of the mixed couples is shown by both the Japanese and the Americans, and there are heroes and villains on both sides as well.<br /><br />As many have noted, the primary romance between Marlon Brando and Miiko Taka is not the most touching.  That is your typical Hollywood fare, with the coolest guy hooking up with the prettiest girl, and living pretty much happily every after.  No, the true love story, the most realistic and moving, is the simple and pure affection between Joe Kelly (Red Buttons) and his wife Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki).  They are not the most beautiful or elegant couple, but the strength of their commitment to each other far exceeds the cultural and legal forces attempting to drive them apart.  Without giving away too much of the story, it is no wonder why these two won Oscars for their performances instead of the more famous lead actors.<br /><br />Along with that, \\"Sayonara\\" gives an accurate and educational tour of Japanese culture, including the main theatrical styles of kabuki, noh, bunraku and Takurazuka, and practices such as the tea ceremony.  The only bit that was a bit off the mark was the typical home life of the couples, which was probably true of the era but hardly reflects a modern Japanese woman.  However, my partner did get a big kick out of the scene where Katsumi washed Joe Kelly's back in the bathtub, as this is a traditional way for wives to show affections for their husband, and something she enjoys doing with me, so perhaps things haven't changed that much.y for wives to show affections for their husband, and something she enjoys doing with me, so perhaps things haven't changed that much.
B000XCZGV8|4.0|As one of the better dramas to emerge out of the studios this past year, and one of the most compelling \\"fact-based\\" films since The Insider, this 2 disc \\"Director's Cut\\" is a little underwhelming.    Considering that this dvd set is obviously targeted to someone appreciated the film in the first place or a Fincher completist (it would appear that the Zodiac theorists revile this film as much as assassination theorist detested Stone's JFK), the set lacks the eye for detail and completeness when compared to other Fincher approved SEs.    The Director's Cut  What was added has been widely publicised already, so I won't go into details. Overall, the changes are very subtle and wouldn't alter anybody's impression of the film. I marginally prefer it to the Theatrical cut (saw it 3 times in the cinema) and the \\" fade to black\\" audio montage suggests the passage of time better than just a caption. I am glad that Fincher got his preferred cut out to the public.    Extras  The quality of the commentaries were mixed, Fincher is informative and entertaining as usual, 2nd commentary is amusing but both parties (actors and production team plus James Ellroy) seem to run out of steam as it nears the film's end. Ellroy's presence is interesting. Compared to the commentaries on the Seven or Fight Club SEs where all sides of the production were heard from and one couldn't help but feel that some corners were cut.     How about a commentary from Savides, the DP or Burt the Production Designer? Or one by the REAL actors like Ruffalo, Edwards, Koteas, Hall or Getz? What about one by Graysmith, Toschi, Armstrong and others? Or a film scholar?     No such luck.    The Supplements    The \\"Film\\" featurettes  Whilst well produced (Shot similar to Errol Morris' Fog of War), beside the \\"fly on the wall\\" shots and audio excerpts (taken from the UK dvd release of the theatrical, which contains a more compact, epk style making of) there is no participation by Fincher, Savides, David Shire or anyof the actors.     The \\"Facts\\" featurettes  Again, all the core parties, with the exception Ken Narlow, Bryan Hartnell, Mike Mageau and a minute or so of Graysmith were MIA.    One could argue that what Fincher, the actors and the characters/ people have to say was already represented in the film and that the supplements are just that, letting the first responders and civilians have their moment but considering the amount of research the production team were reported to have made, one also couldn't help but feel that their absence made the experience somewhat incomplete.    What's also missing?    Deleted scenes  Tantalising glimpses of a few were seen in the \\"Film\\" featurette.     Maybe it's this set's 6 month delay (from the plain vanilla issue) or the fact that I got it immediately after viewing the Blade Runner 5 disc set (which has got to be the most complete and satisfying SE, ever*) made it a bigger let-down for me than it should.    As it stands, this 2-disc DC edition is a more than competent studio release but a lackluster and surprisingly incomplete Fincher dvd (where \\"lesser works\\" like Alien 3 and Panic Room have superior/more comprehensive supplements). In Fincher's filmography only the The Game SE has \\"less\\" to offer.    *The BR dvd set had the ability to turn me - a detached admirer - into a passionate \\"fan\\" of Blade Runner.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|[[ASIN:B000VWYJ86 The Bourne Ultimatum (Widescreen Edition)]]All three movies in the series were excellent, but I believe this one was the best of the three.  A fine way to end a great series of movies.
B000XA5K48|5.0|It might be tough for me to explain why I so loved this film, but I'll give it a go anyway.<br /><br />After recently watching and reviewing [[ASIN:B000Y7WGOW The Kingdom]], I explained that I wasn't one of those movie critics who enjoyed action over plot (with a few exceptions, of course). And this is why I fell head-over-heels for SHOOT `EM UP. It is precisely an action over plot film. But wait! Let me explain! It's that and quite a bit more.<br /><br />What Shoot `em up does is take that style of action and put it into absolutely ludicrous proportions. And in doing so it makes great fun of itself and all those action films that've come before. From the gun-loving and reluctant dark hero, to the hooker with a heart of gold, Shoot `em up takes these themes to far out extremes and makes for some of the funniest scenes you'll ever see.<br /><br />Let me give you an example: In one scene Mr. Smith (Clive Owen, [[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men]]), our dark hero, escapes with a newborn baby  from some bad guys and runs into a very filthy bathroom. He promptly jumps into a stall and up onto the toilet so that anyone entering won't be able to see his feet below the stall door. But, while juggling the baby and his most beloved handgun, he drops the pistol into the toilet. Thinking quickly, he puts the baby down on the disgusting floor, fishes his gun from the toilet bowl, heads over to the baby changing station on the wall, and begins lovingly cleaning his weapon while the baby gurgles happily from the heavily soiled floor.<br /><br />If you don't like this kind of humor then, please, stay away from this movie.<br /><br />This is quite a departure from previous Clive Owen films that I've seen. Being more of the \\"serious\\" actor, it was nice to see him in something so ridiculously funny and out of (what I thought to be) character for him.<br /><br />The other surprise was the estimable Paul Giamatti ([[ASIN:B000JLTR8Q Lady in the Water]]) as a hitman out to kill the mother of the baby that Owen's character initially saves. Not only does Hertz (Giamatti) want the woman dead, but also her child. But when an unsuspecting tough guy named Mr. Smith (Owens) inadvertently gets involved in his \\"business\\", Giamatti's character gets much more than he bargained for. This was quite a change of pace for Giamatti who tends to play quieter characters. Here in Shoot `em up he's a loud sociopath with a penchant for killing. He's also hysterically funny as he tries to kill the baby and now Mr. Smith all while juggling a demanding wife who continually calls him on the phone at the most inopportune times (\\"Honey. I'm busy right now. I'll have to call you back.\\")<br /><br />Donna Quintano (Monica Bellucci) plays the hooker with a heart of gold role after Mr. Smith (Owens) comes to her for assistance with the baby. Donna recently lost her own child and Mr. Smith knows that having a new baby around will help her ...as well as himself. But her morales aren't very well grounded. When they run out of money to buy bullets, Donna tries to help by utilizing her prostitute skills near a dumpster ...much to the chagrin of Mr. Smith.<br /><br />Plot-wise, it doesn't make much sense. There's a series of scenes devoted to why Giamatti's character is trying to kill the baby (politics, advanced medicine, presidential candidates, etc.) but it doesn't make much difference. It is the outlandish antics of Mr. Smith and his over-the-top James Bond-ish shooting abilities that make this film what it is. And you'll howl with laughter as the bullets fly, the targets get hit with impossible accuracy, the prostitute and the tough guy fall for each other, all while this newborn takes a wild ride.saves.

B000J10ERO|2.0|I purchased this as a gift for my Superman-crazed younger brother, but I couldn't get past about 45 minutes into it. I found it slow, unexciting, and didn't feel the acting was very strong. Definitely nowhere near the level Christpher Reeve played Superman/Clark Kent, though I'm not sure anyone could top him.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|For a concert this is very well done.  For anyone that is a Celine fan, this is a must have.

V was both glamorous and shocking.  Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving were excellent in their roles.  The bond that grew between them seemed so real.  This movie put a whole new twist on Guy Fawkes' Day for me.  I definitely want to get my hands on the graphic novel by David Lloyd.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|It is a really good movie. Now i have all 3 movies and they fit together like a glove with more room is move around like if the producers of the movie deciede to do another movie which i would like to see happen.   And of course Matt Damon is one fine actor.  He is very believable as Jason Bourne.    I do have one thing wrong with the movie.  The in your face camera during some of the chase scenes.  The camera was too jerky and out of focus but i guess the producers like them so that is why they were in the movie. I myself could do without the in your face camera shots during chases   But overall a fine movie and if they make more i will be right there waiting for them

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity does a good job of answering some of the mysteries of the Firefly season, except why such an exceptional series was cancelled in the first place!  Rev. Book's political power and history remain a mystery, but are not relevant to Serenity's story, although his views on the morality of the actions which created the Reavers and Malcolm's subsequent actions would have been interesting.  The Love-bot introduces a good concept, reminiscent of the Borg concept when it was first introduced into Star Trek.  If you love Firefly, you must see this finale.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|\\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is the most original and endearing movie that I have ever watched.  My younger sister urged me to watch it for months before I finally gave in and lost a couple of hours of precious sleep time to see it.    There's one scene on a bus that displays what is likely the most genuine and sincere and charming apology ever.    There's another scene that fans of this movie will agree is the best cookie scene ever in a motion picture.    And not to be left out, if you have ever felt it in you to learn how to play the guitar so that you can one day sing a song for someone you adore, you cannot miss this movie.    Enjoy.

The film was extremely clean and clear, the effects were phenominal, and the sound track is amazing! I recommend this to anyone who is a Superman fan! My only grip with the film was during the explosion of the sun of Krypton; you actually see the room in which the fake sun exploded. At normal play speed you see the black curtain behind the sun as well as the shadow from the roof and walls. I guess you really can see everything in High Definition!    Over all excellent movie in high Def.

1594489505|5.0|Excellent.  Could not put it down.  When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it.  I had to put it down at times because the life these woman had to endure was too horrific.  It also makes you realize that there are real people that have to endure hardships because of war. What we see on the news never compares to what is really happening to the innocents, the women and children.  I think this should be required reading in HS & College English classes. I loved how the lives were interwoven of the characters.  He shows all sides of the characters.  Loved the book.  As good or better than THE KITE RUNNER.  Can't wait for his next book.

A elite SWAT team led by Peter (Ken Foree) with his crew Roger, Fran and Stephen seek shelter at a mall somewhere in Pennslyvania to find refugee from the walking dead.They also end up having to fight for their lives from the zombies that are also inside the mall, So they decide to get whatever they can from inside the stores of the mall to stay alive especially food and weapons, Little do they know that an army of bikers are coming to pay them a little unfriendly visit, Not only do they have zombies to deal with but now they have to battle the biker gang for control of the mall.<br /><br />The all time greatest zombie movie next to \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" ( 1968)! George A. Romero has wrote and direct a stunning sequel to his classic zombie movie and has been considered to be even better then it's precessor by some fans. The movie combines gruesome violence, gore and social satire with some average acting by the cast, this motion picture was originally given an \\"X\\" by MPAA but fortunately it was released unrated into theaters and was the first time in years that a movie was released without a rating but with a warning that said \\"No one under 17 will be admitted\\". The movie was a minor success in theaters and drive-ins with flavorable reviews especially by Roger Ebert whom admired this movie and called it \\"An American Horror Classic\\", the movie has became one of the most often imitated but never equaled horror movies of all time! no words could describe how great this movie is, you have see it for youself,  if you haven't seen it go to your video store to and pick up the original classic \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", the remake was good but can't surpass the original.<br /><br />The ultimate 4-Disc edition contains the U.S. theatrical cut, the director's cut, the Argento-produced Euro cut, and a documentary with audio commentaries by the cast and crew, publicity materials, Poster-and-still galleries, interviews, Easter Eggs, and biographies. The soundtrack by Goblin is a funky and fun rock music score mainly in the Euro and Director's cuts and a more somber one in the U.S. cut, this is a a must have soundtrack and perfect for halloween parties.Euro cut, and a documentary with audio commentaries by the cast and crew, publicity materials, Poster-and-still galleries, interviews, Easter Eggs, and biographies.

0385522401|5.0|I just finished this novella and cannot stop thinking about it.  Ian McEwan is a master at filling few words with great emotion; I admire that about him.  The young couple, Edward and Florence, are full of life, chomping at the bit, ready for their futures to begin.  They have each lived their lives as though the journey was not as important as the destination, never realizing that the journey each has been on is what led them to each other, to their marriage, to the hotel on their wedding night.  Each character is revealed in flashback, and much is told about their differing backgrounds and likes, dislikes.  They truly seem to love one another, yet Florence is hiding a terrible secret; her horror at the thought of sexual contact is making her wedding night a nightmare for her.  The disaster that ensues results from these two young people being unable to communicate their deepest emotions to one another.  The sorrow and poignancy of the moment on the beach when they make their break will last them the rest of their lives.  I really liked this book because McEwan makes these young people believable to the reader, in a short time.  The nuances of the language reveal a great deal of depth of meaning and emotion.  Every word fits, every gesture, description, thought has meaning to the whole.  The pain of remembering what is forever lost is strong, but it seems that neither Florence nor Edward really learned the lesson they should have:  that life's journey is indeed that, a journey.  And if dreams reside only in the future, they will never come true.  The naivete of the young couple is brilliantly revealed and the long look back takes courage to face, for both the couple and the reader.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Reading the other reviews, I agree and so do the others I know that got caught up with this beautiful story and its characters.  But where are the other seasons?  Can anyone,maybe even Amazon, put pressure on someone to release the other seasons to DVD???
1400049628|5.0|This book is so much fun.  I never get tired of picking it up and reading through it.  Reads like a survival manual for your most paranoid fantasies/nightmares.  It will amuse your friends whether they're into horror or not, and it makes a great (though small) coffee table book.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you are looking for something different Planet Earth is the way to go. The entire series is made with a grace in it self; Planet Earth is a combination of National Geographic and Nature, with the difference that Planet Earth mix space Earth images with ground one for a more specific angle The video quality is supreme, with no artifacts or any type of noise I would not be surprise if this video series become a Blu ray reference or a standard too evaluate Blu ray TV sets in terms of image.<br />N.R.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I read really good rave reviews about the movie and I rented this DVD with a lot of expectations. I thought the movie was a pretty good movie with a good soundtrack. The acting was decent considering that their acting experience. I expected the movie to be spectacular but it was not in that league. Nevertheless, a good DVD rental.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|I'm a big fan of both the movie and the CD soundtrack that is sold separately.<br /><br />The four disc version of Blade Runner is the cheapest way to get all the versions of the movie.  Like many other reviewers I actually prefer the version with the voice over as well.  I makes Deckard just a tad more believable as a guy who is just a little fed up with the status quo.  The narration really communicates Deckard's attitude.  The \\"Final Cut\\" version has a much terser finish and gives up the happy ending of the original release.  Both are pretty good but gives the viewer two completely different feelings at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Blade Runner was the first movie Ridely Scott released after the super successful Alien in 1979.  In fact, fans of Alien will recognize some of the same sound effects in Blade Runner.  Anyway, I think one of the reasons Scott compromised with the studios on the final cut for the 1982 release was that he wanted another hit.  Instead, Blade Runner really was a bit of a flop at the box office.  Whether \\"the Final Cut\\" would have been more successful from a financial perspective in 1982 is purely speculation.  Of course, we see it now for the profoundly insightful movie that it really is.<br /><br />This four disc version of Blade Runner has it all.  I
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Very dramatic in depth documentary, a must see. One man who gave it his all for the good of his country. I didnt know who Robert S. McNamara really was until I saw this great film. After watching this film you will appreciate and understand this talented great man that served in the US government.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Fast transaction, great DVD, previous buyer. Will do business with  you in the future.
B000PFU7OO|3.0|I bought this CD after reading rave reviews about the soundtrack. It has two great songs \\"Falling slowly\\" and \\"If your minds made up\\". But nothing extra ordinary with the rest of the other songs and the album lacks variety. I personally feel that I would have been better off just downloading those two songs.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I gave this CD to my daughter as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  She enjoys it and listens to it frequently.  Highly rated and recommended for young listeners of popular music. [[ASIN:B000WMEAKC Dreaming Out Loud]]

Hot Chocolate appeals to the child in us all...and makes us long for a cold day in which to sip and dance.
0307346617|5.0|For diehard zombie fans, this is a must read. In most zombie books or flicks the Z's just appear, they give a 10 page as to why they appeared and what they are doing about them. This book covers the what,why and how they dealt with them. I can't wait for the movie to come out and hope they do not butcher it like some other novel to the big screen projects...
B000TFINY6|5.0|This was my first viewing of a TV season in High-Def and I have to say the finished product is phenomenal and fans will not be disappointed.     LOST suffered through it's second season and started off slow with the third, but by the end the writers totally redeemed themselves and gave fans a finale they had dreamed of. Critics who say LOST never answers the many questions the show poses were silenced as Season 3 gave answers to some of the biggest questions fans had:    - Who is this guy pretending to be \\"Henry Gale?\\"  - What do the Others want with Jack, Kate and Sawyer?  - Who are The Others?  - What were the \\"lists\\" the Others had and how did they know so much about the castaways?  - What happened to the hatch and those that were inside it?  - Why can't anyone find the island?  - Why are there polar bears on a tropical island?  - How did Locke become paralyzed and why can he walk now?  - Why did the Others really kidnap Claire in Season 1?     These questions and more are answered definitively.    Season 1 focused on the castaways, Season 2 on the hatch and the mysteries of the island, Season 3 focuses on The Others, finally given the viewers insight into their lives on the island and the motives behind their mysterious actions. Of course the writers don't give away everything, and there are plenty of unanswered questions to keep people's interests peaked, but overall Season 3 is tragic, innovative, entertaining, and very satisfying.       As for the Blu-Ray version itself, you couldn't ask for a better show to have in Hi-Def. The picture quality is outstanding. The discs feature a new option called \\"SeasonPlay\\" which will play the season straight through with asking you to press play ever again. This smart new feature remembers where you left off in the season, and if you insert the wrong disc it will remind you where the next chronological episode is. Upon finishing a disc, a screen will pop up asking you to insert the next disc, and will automatically begin playing the next episode once you switch discs. This is an awesome feature for anyone who likes to watch several episodes back to back and removes some of the more tedious parts of doing so.      The bonus features on disc six offer fans exactly what they've been asking for: answers. In a sit down interview segment called Access Granted, show producers give definitive answers and explinations for things about the show. Is a certain character really dead? What was the purpose of the hatch in season 2? What did the button really do? etc.   There are also some deleted scenes, outtakes and cast interviews that fans will definitely enjoy.
B000O176Q6|5.0|Wow! That was my initial reaction when I first saw this film on full hd.     Movie looked great with good action sequences, believable storyline, villains and good sound, visuals.     Overall, I was very impressed with the quality and documentaries were very nice touch. I was glued to the TV for 5 hours straight.

B000VI6T6K|5.0|It's pure magic to hear Jimi Hendrix at Monterey fourty years ago. His music hasn't lost one bit of actuality. Maybe some of todays music historians should reconsider Hendrix' place in music history. Listen to 'The wind cries Mary' and imagine it as a new release. You shouldn't be suprised if it hit the charges.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend, she loved it!  It was a lot cheaper on amazon than at best buy.
B00023B1A8|3.0|I consider myself a fan though I own only two CDs. I've long wanted one of their DVDs, and almost bought this a week ago. As luck would have it, I managed to borrow it from a friend - but was hugely disappointed. I found it very boring. I actually couldn't watch it. I expected more energy, more harmonies, more instrumental. I guess I have to revise my opinion - I'm a fan of their first two CDs. I still have nothing but favourable sentiment for these guys, but won't be rushing into buying any of their DVDs.
B000TLMWMY|4.0|My husband and I both really enjoyed the DVD's. Interesting details and interviews with guest. We love the old country music its a classic!!!

B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is a 2 dvd set.  One is black and white and the other is colorized.  Both are great.  I love the colorized version but it's nice to own the b/w for the purists in this world who want to watch at my house.  The price was excellent.  It's a great addition to my holiday movies.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|This was a hit the snuck in under the radar.  Its an adult romantic comedy.  If you enjoyed watching the Princess Bride you will love this movie!  Its got a few surprises in it that you would never epect.  The acting was marvelous.  You really do need to see this movie.

B000W07EKW|5.0|I bought the Bourne Trilogy as a Christmas gift for my 37 year old son who had only seen the first movie but was looking forward to seeing the other two. He was delighted to receive it and watched 2 and 3 over the holidays. Everyone probably knows how good these movies are so I won't belabor that. I found them exciting, intriguing and satisfying on many levels. What was a pleasant surprise was the packaging they came in. Not only does the box hold all three with a magnetic flap but there is a very authentic looking Bourne passport inside. Fun!
0201485672|4.0|This book is just a real easy read, with lots of good information. You can pretty much flip to any page in the book, read, and learn something. You don't have to read chapter by chapter - it's just real easy to jump into.    Lots of tips seem self-evident, but I doubt they would be to rookie programmers. It's definitely a book new programmers should get their hands on early.
B000W07EKW|5.0|I bought this set for my husband for our anniversary. I had rented it and he enjoyed it so much that I had to get the set for him. It came in a great package with extras on the Dvd's that he loves watching. I had never watched all the movies only the Bourne Ultimatum from beginning to end so it was great to be able to sit and watch the entire series from the beginning and not keep asking questions. This is a great set and a great gift for a spy movie fan.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|Not bad.  Tons of action.  Pretty much non stop action. I'm gonna have to go with the first one of course being the best.  It was good to watch this one, besides all the good chase senes, but it was good to see how it ended, or was it the beginning.  It was a good watch.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I was reading some of the reviews for \\"Miss Potter\\" just now, and was very dissapointed in what those who gave in 1 star wrote.  This film may not appeal to everyone, but I think it is one of the best I've seen.  In our culture, language, violence, and sensuality fill the movies that families and kids watch--it upsets me greatly.  This film has a beautiful romance story, as well as wonderful imaginative qualities, with nothing innapropriate.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and am very glad that we purchased it.
B000VBJEFK|2.0|Bought the wrong one!  Blue ray?  who knew.  It's opened, can I return it?
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This HDDVD is an incredible piece of work.  My wife and I could not stop watching it.  The images and the slow motion editing in some scenes where incredible.  There was this scene, although gory, where a whale comes out of the water grabbing on to a seal and spinning in the air in slow motion. Many of the images were highlighted with the fact that it was on HD.  I would highly recommend it to non-National Geographic buffs as well.  The narration and music are also highlights to this treasure of a documentary.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|This item came to me much faster than expected , well packaged in a box and in perfect new condition when I opened it. The DVD set is more than I expected to the extent that I have not been able to see 100% of it but so far its been absolutely great!!!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This final installment of the Jason Bourne trilogy of action-spy tales is crowding the original as the best, if not most satisfying of the three. The spell-binding tension in the action-fight-car chase scenes is breathtaking. I had to hit the pause button to catch my breath and look over at my fellow viewers to confirm the quality of the staging and editing of this triller. While the third installment in a movie trilogy rarely matches the orginal installment, this one does. I do not have to encourage anyone who has watched the first two in this trilogy to catch this one, as they are already probably writing their positive reveiw. Not to miss.
1595141715|5.0|This is the first time I've ever done a review for Amazon. I had to hunt this book down and post a review, because this was one of the most riveting books I have ever read. I literally could NOT put it down; I like to tell my friends that they could have set me on fire and I wouldn't have bothered to put myself out (it would have taken care of itself, right?).     I'm not sure I can get much more specific without bringing out some spoilers. You've already read the summary, and suffice it for me to say that the rest of the book lives up to the premise.     Thank you, mister Asher. I'm a librarian in a fairly small community, and I look forward to bringing this book and any future ones to the attention of...well, anyone who stands still long enough, to be honest.
B0009ML238|5.0|A little over a year after I initially bought this album, everything finally \\"clicked\\" and I gained an appreciation for Circus Maximus that was not there before. As a result, they have quickly jumped into my personal top favorite list of progressive rock/metal bands. Impressive, considering that they only have two albums under their belt.<br /><br />Circus Maximus blends intense vocals, crushing riffs, and Dream Theater inspired virtuosity throughout their music. Everything, from the song writing right down to the production, is outstanding.<br /><br />What stood out to me is the amount of variety that has been packed onto this disc. Each and every song has a different feel and level of intensity. This fact, coupled with the progressive nature of the band, makes for an extremely meaty experience that offers something new with each listen.<br /><br />The album begins with the crushingly-heavy \\"Sin\\". This is the perfect opening to the album, catching the listener with heavy riffs and change-ups throughout the song, while skillfully introducing Michael Eriksen's higher-octave vocal style. The intensity continues on a slightly different level with \\"Alive\\", where Michael Eriksen really shines with his performance along with the musical arrangement trade-offs this track gives us. The album continues with \\"Glory of the Empire\\", a ten-minute epic that features all the progressive elements that make up Circus Maximus, and seems to tell an epic tale that grips the listener by the throat and refuses to let go until well after it's over. This truly is a wonderful song.<br /><br />This is just a taste of the incredible flavor and variety found here. The album continues with the instrumental, technical barrage that is \\"Biosfear\\", which allow the amazing musicianship of each member of the band to really shine through. A break from the aggression happens with \\"Silence from Angels Above\\", a ballad that overlays Erikson's vocals atop soft acoustic guitars and keyboard arrangements. The action picks right back up where it left off with \\"Why Am I Here?\\", in which we see a return to the double bass-driven thunder riffs of the first track. Next up is \\"The Prophecy\\", one of the more truly progressive songs on the disc.<br /><br />Finally we come to the magnum opus, a near-twenty minute progressive masterpiece. Much like \\"Glory of the Empire\\" every element of the band's virtuosity can be found here. Circus Maximus has a wonderful ability to switch from beautiful acoustics and piano arrangements to smashing yet intelligent guitar riffs and scorching solos.<br /><br />There is not a bad track on this album. Pick this up immediately and introduce yourself to an amazing new entry in the world of progressive rock/metal. Also check out Circus Maximus' most recent album, \\"Isolate\\". Both are highly recommended!where it left off with \\"Why Am I Here?\\", in which we see a return to the double bass-driven thunder riffs of the first track.

1554072840|5.0|Years ago, I remember reading this book to the kids when I was babysitting. They loved it!   Today, I'm a mom. I was thrilled to see that this classic still has it's magic. My daughter loves it!
B000W1V5VU|3.0|This is hoping they quit at lucky 13. This entry in the Ocean's heist franchise is entertaining and mildly engaging. Ocean's Eleven being the opener of the series was, of course, the best. You would've thought that Twelve would have been the last, not being all that good. But if you like these actors and this sort of movie, you should like Thirteen. Although, farther fetched, in plot than I liked, if you are willing to go along with it, watching Al Pacino do his stuff is worth it.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I watched Tokyo Godfathers, but loved it by the end. I've seen Millennium Actress and Perfect Blue, neither of which sincerely moved me, although the animation was beautiful.  I loved this film because it was set in the everyday, making it much more accessible for the viewer. I cared for the somewhat irreverent characters and was touched by the small miracles the movie centered around. It had a great blend of drama and humor, and in the end it inspires hope, which I don't normally associate with Satoshi Kon's anime. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised!

B000YPUF9W|5.0|This ain't \\"Oasis of the Zombies\\".  This is the third installment of Resident Evil, and it's a literal blast!<br /><br />The series took a big risk by taking inspiration from the Mad Max movies, and I must say it was a brilliant idea.  The post-apocalyptic take really provided a very different edge to the movie, and the featured extras go into the philosophy of why they chose a desertscape for the third.<br /><br />People get bit and eaten, and I found it much gorier than the first or second.  The first, which I thoroughly enjoyed, fell short in the gore department.  This one, though not on the scale of the standard Romero feasts, brought the blood.<br /><br />The movie provided a good union of the slow shamblers to the doctored runners.  The souped-up zombies in the desert casino scene were scary, and the action was quite intense.<br /><br />The story revolves around Umbrella's continued meddling in the global epidemic and its involvement in the Alice project.  And watch out!  Tyrant is on the loose.<br /><br />This third is yet another tribute to its source material, a fun new high-tech twist to zombie combat (Alice is a killing machine), and an homage to the revitalized tradition of zombie horror.

0596527055|4.0|A good solid book - this isn't an inspirational book on innovation or a how-to book on innovation, it's more a 'from the trenches' book that educates using the misconceptions people usually have about innovation.     The thing I really liked about the book was the cross-references to sources / interesting articles, I wish the books web site had an easy list of these.     The thing I didn't care much in the book was Berkun's style of writing - he's got great data to share, but I found the style of writing to be flippant, presumptuous about the readers lack of knowledge about innovation myths & straining to be funny at times! I'd rather that he'd kept it more simple.    The chapters - \\"Good ideas are hard to find\\", \\"Your boss knows more about innovation than you\\" and \\"Problems and solutions\\" were terrific & was worth the price of this book.    Overall, 4 stars - I read this book, & want to read it again slowly, especially checking out the references.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This motion picture, directed by Martin Campbell (Goldeneye) created a dichotomy in my family and in my movie-going community: one side was utterly disappointed, even disgusted, and the other side surprisingly impressed. For once, I sided with the critics--many who extoled this latest of Bond films for its refreshing candor, dark edge and gritty realism. I say, for once, because, more often than not, I have taken the opposite side of the majority of critics (see my other reviews here and elsewhere), finding gems where others have found only rock. This time I have good company; except for my own family and friends, that is. It would seem that, although Casino Royale was highly regarded by the critics of the franchise, its long-standing viewing public was not equally impressed. Yes, this was a different Bond movie, which the Mandelbrot fractal designed title opening and title song hinted at: did you listen to the words of the title song?<br /><br />Of those in the negative camp there appear to be two major reasons for rejecting this lastest version of Bond. One is the Bond character himself (played with edgy grit by tautly coiled Daniel Craig) and how the other characters were portrayed (especially Bond Girl,Vesper Lynd, superbly played by Eva Green but with no revealing cleavage); the second is the lack of Bond clich&eacute;s, such as the techno-gadgetry, non-stop action, womanizing and comic-book humour. Despite showcasing some of the most mouth-watering chase scenes (particularly the opening chase with parkour [free running] originator, Sebasti&eacute;n Foucan, and Craig doing most of the stunts himself), this Bond film was a more thoughtful one. It was also probably one of the most physically demanding Bond films to play by its lead character. David Edelstein of New York Magazine, describes the director's \\"awe for the poetry of human bodies doing things that, evolutionarily speaking, they haven't needed to do since the saber-toothed tiger died off.\\"<br /><br />There are, I think, several reasons for this dichotomy between those of us who loved Casino Royale and those who remained diffident, disappointed or outright disliked it. One of which--and it is I think an important one--is that I have read the entire series, and long before a flashy movie was made using the title (often only using the title!). I grew up with Sean Connery as the quintessential Bond, a roughly handsome man with striking eyes and a cruel mouth.<br />In the book version of Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd, after just meeting Bond, admits to Mathis: \\"He is very good looking...but there is something cold and ruthless in his [mouth]...\\" Ian Fleming's Bond is a somber misogynist who initially wants to bed Vesper as if to punish her for not falling for his charm:<br /><br />Her eyes were wide apart and deep blue and they gazed candidly back at Bond with a touch of ironical disinterest which, to his annoyance, he found he would like to shatter, roughly.<br /><br />I would not describe Campbell's Bond as a misogynist, despite tendencies for being a ruthless sociopath with a slightly sadistic sense of humour. After Casino Royale and his experience with one particular woman, he might have turned into one, though...<br />Daniel Craig and those scintillating radioactive blue eyes brings us back to why we are ultimately fascinated with the character of James Bond. Think for a moment: this man is basically a sociopath, an assassin with a license to kill, dispense violence and torture to protect queen and country--a concept. Well, perhaps not quite a concept. Which brings us to M, Bond's pithy superior in MI-6 in the British Secret Service. Bond is like a child in many ways, emotionally certainly. David Edelstein of New York Magazine describes Craig's Bond as: \\"haunted, not yet housebroken, still figuring out his persona.\\"<br /><br />The movie series--and this film in particular--explores this aspect of Bond through his complex relationship with M (played superbly by Dame Judi Dench). M is like a mother to him. His allegiance to queen and country, so prevalent in many of the Bond movies, appears a natural progression of this intuitive search to belong and connect, particularly in his reltionship with M. He breaks into her private house, not for a moment realizing--or capable of caring-- what this invasion of privacy means to her. M scolds Bond like he is a child and calls him a \\"blunt instrument\\". Says M: \\"Any thug can kill. I want you to take your ego out of the equation.\\" Craig's Bond is the closest to the original character envisaged by Fleming, who describes Bond's features as \\"a taciturn mask, ironical, brutal, and cold.\\" Carrie Rickey of the Philadelphia Inquirer describes Craig as \\"earthy and exotic, holding himself like a smoking gun.\\"<br /><br />Thanks to excellent script writing by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Paul Haggis, it is Vesper Lynd in the movie who recognizes that Bond is an orphan, looking for home--though she doesn't call him on the latter. Bond is a man who doesn't recognize boundaries, who's closed off his emotions from the rest of him.<br /><br />The length to which he protects that inner vulnerable self is evident in his rakish and shallow relationships with women. After Vesper insists on separate rooms at the hotel, Bond says, \\"Don't worry. You're not my type.\\" To which she tartly quips, \\"Smart?\\" And he responds, \\"Single.\\" This is more elaborately described in the book:<br /><br />Bond saw luck as a woman, to be softly wooed or brutally ravaged, never pandered to or pursued...One day, and he accepted the fact, he would be brought to his knees by love or by luck. When that happened he knew that he too would be branded with the deadly question-mark he recognized so often in others, the promise to pay before you have lost; the acceptance of fallibility.<br /><br />It is so apt that Vesper Lynd is the one to shatter his cool and it is she (in the form of luck and love) who literally brings him to his knees by the last pages of the book with her tragic act of suicide.<br /><br />Despite a truly chilling villain in Le Chiffre (played by Mads Mikkelsen) and that frightening souless Mister White (keep an eye on him from the first scene; I think he will resurface in Bond 22), it is not the villains in Casino Royale who place equal footing with Bond; it is the two women in his life. I found atypical \\"Bond Girl\\" Vesper Lynd (his alluring and mysterious foil with dark depth) and M, his forthright boss, equally compelling and complex as Bond. They, better than the villains, help to define Bond and permit the film to rise from the shallows of its predecesors into the interesting arena of real art.<br /><br />This definitive Bond film, begins appropriately wtih a slick black and white prologue of Bond's pre `00' status (prior to achieving two kills). The heady and violent chiaroscuro creates a mood in keeping with the edgy grit of Craig's Bond, \\"whose cruel charisma rivals that of Sean Connery\\" (Ty Burr, Boston Globe). Every scene that follows defines Bond: his ruthless drive in the footchase; his sardonic humor when he's mistaken for a valet and \\"punishes\\" the customer by crashing his expensive car, marking Bond's disdain for the declass&eacute; rich (a trait that is further made apparent during Vesper's penetrating analysis of him in the train).<br /><br />Producer, Barbara Broccoli, successfully subverted the Bond trope to finally portray a \\"Bond Girl\\" as equal to Bond; someone equally complex, mysterious and interesting with her own compelling story, so much so that she draws the insular Bond into it. \\"The idea of a woman who is Bond's equal is unusual in the 007 series,\\" says Jay Stone of the Times Colonist in his article entitled, \\"Bond Girl with Brains\\". Vesper is a compelling character, a real person; not just a mannequin for men to fantacize over. There have been other intelligent and strong-willed Bond Girls (e.g., Jinx in Die Another Day; Polly Goodhead in Moonraker; NatalyaSimonova in Goldeneye), but none as engaging, none as vulnerable, contradictory and multi-layered as Vesper, who harbors a dark secret. It is partly Vesper's dark secret that unknowingly clinches Bond's interest. Vesper demonstrates right from her opening scene where she first meets Bond onboard a Euro fast train that she is not a typical Bond girl. First there is no gushy \\"Oh, she's gaspingly beautiful!\\" music to accompany her on-screen entrance; no highlighting of her physical attributes; no bikini to cue us in that she is the \\"Bond Girl\\".<br />Instead, Vesper sweeps in like a summer storm and sits across from Bond, dressed in what he describes as \\"slightly masculine cut clothing\\" and flashes him with eyes that sparkle of taunting girlish impudence. As she takes her seat, she summarily announces \\"I'm the money,\\" succinctly letting him know that she is in charge and what she thinks of him. Even his attempt at a rakish response, \\"Every penny of it,\\" doesn't phase her and she launches into a sarcastic examination of the plan, further letting him know what she thinks of the whole plan of poker: \\"I suppose you've given some thought to the notion that if you lose, our government will have directly financed terrorism\\". So she'll be keeping her eye on their government's money and not on Bond's \\"perfectly formed\\" backside. To this Bond quips, \\"You noticed.\\" Vesper has a quick come back: \\"Even accountants have imagination.\\" To his suggestion of a plan, \\"Oh, there's a plan,\\" she responds in a mocking tone. \\"I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and hundreds of lives on a game of chance.\\" Then she challenges him on his ability to bluff and read people (which provides the first in several installments of a subplot involving bluffing and \\"tells\\").<br /><br />Their verbal joust, which sizzles with sexual tension, escalates when Bond, priding himself in his ability to read people, demonstrates his skill as a poker player by arrogantly analyzing Vesper's personality and life from cues in their conversation. She turns the tables by doing an even more penetrating character sketch of him, calling him on his hubris and ego, and essentially outbluffing him:<br /><br />\\"By the cut of your suit you went to Oxford or wherever and actually think human beings dress like that. But you wear it with such disdain. My guess is you didn't come from money and your school friends never let you forget it, which means you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity, hence the chip on your shoulder...and since your first thought about me ran to orphan, that's what I'd say you are...\\" Seeing his expression, she gloats, \\"Oh, you are! I like this poker thing. And it makes perfect sense. Since MI6 looks for maladjusted young men who give little thought to sacrificing others in order to protect queen and country. You know, former SAS types, with easy smiles and expensive watches...\\" She glances down at his. \\"Rolex?\\" Then dives in for the killing blow: \\"Now, having just met you, I wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold-hearted bastard...but it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine you think of women as disposable pleasures rather than meaningful pursuits.\\"<br /><br />But more than outbluffing him, Vesper also proves herself to be a complex person on her own \\"hero's journey\\", a tortured character (we find out only later) with heavy matters to consider that involve more than the Bond girl's typical single question: \\"should I sleep with this guy or not?\\" The fullness and depth of her character as a \\"real\\" person is no better found than in the tender shower scene midway, where we are reminded that Vesper is a real person, an accountant unused to violence. Again, we find Bond about to enter their common bathroom to the sounds of a shower; I fully expected to see the typical playful scene between the Bond girl, nude in the shower, and Bond. But when he opens the door, she is revealed sitting under the shower, still fully clothed in her evening gown, shivering in shock. She'd just witnessed (and had even helped) a violent altercation in which Bond had to beat a man to death. For the first time in this series, we have a perfectly plausible reaction. Vesper is strong at first and assists Bond by helping to force the gun out of the assailant's hand, then breaks down after she's done what needs to be done and is alone. Bond surprises us by melting into a caring human being as he quietly and patiently comforts Vesper. And Broccoli tastefully does not let it dissolve into a sexual love scene. This scene is just one of several where the film takes a typical Bond clich&eacute; and brazenly turns it on its side--where we expect one thing and get quite another. An amusing example of this is when Bond playfully informs Vesper, as they are driving to their hotel, of her cover name (\\"Miss Stephanie Broadchest\\") to which she takes great exception.<br /><br />Vesper certainly has Bond sized up. \\"There are dinner jackets and there are dinner jackets,\\" Vesper informs the bemused Bond in an earlier scene. She introduces him to the tailored tuxedo, in which he looks utterly splendid, by the way. The scene where he critically eyes himself in the mirror in his new tux provides us with a snapshot that is all Bond (and all Craig, I should add!): suave, sophisticated and mercurial, yet boyishly inviting, even awkward. Eva Green's \\"Vesper is teasing, angry, and vulnerable in madly unpredictable proportions\\" David Edelstein (New York Magazine) adds. A smart, self-possessed government accountant, Vesper \\"has the sensuality and extraordinary empathy to tenderize [Bond's] presence,\\" said Scragow of the Baltimore Sun. Broccoli improved on Fleming's Vesper by making her a treasury accountant in charge of the money, and therefore of Bond.<br /><br />Keeping true to Fleming's first James Bond book, the film version of Casino Royale is, at its heart, a tragic love story. As Stax (IGN) says: \\"Bond falls in love, he changes; he cares for a woman rather than just lusts after her. They make love, laugh, quarrel but there is a friendship and tenderness between them. That makes the outcome of the story and Bond's infamous last line--`the bitch is dead'--all the more heartbreaking\\". Casino Royale is a story of how a scarred man found his humanity through love, only to loose both to the `game'. The irony of what Bond became, following Vesper's death, lies in her absolute mastery of him. Her power over his heart was elegantly shown as she both physically and metaphorically jumpstarted it. In fact, she saves his life twice. In the end she beats him with the ultimate bluff, beating him squarely at his own game. When she realizes that she will never escape SPECTRE, Vesper successfully hides her tortured decision to save Bond by ironically betraying him. In keeping with the book, Vesper's character is tormented by her genuine love for Bond and her conviction that he would hate her once he learned the truth about her--compelling her to end her life. The reason she succeeds so well in outbluffing him (and the audience) is because in matters of the heart she is tenderly sincere. As Bond himself declared to her, \\"Everyone has a `tell'...except you...that's why I love you.\\" Blinded by their mutual love, he is totally sidewinded by her underhandedness. This explains why Bond later refuses to lower his armor and become vulnerable with any other woman; how can he trust his spy-sense when matters of the heart intersect and blur his cold judgement? He must, Bond concludes, keep them apart, tuck that humanity way inside, never let it get out again.<br /><br />While some of the movie-Bond tropes are there...they are few and well placed and just enough to remind us of how Bond uses off-colour humor to disarm or even to disturb. After a near-fatal interlude during the film's card game, he quips, \\"I'm sorry, that last hand nearly killed me.\\"<br />Another clich&eacute; which this film turned on its side is the classic figure emerging out of the sea--this time not the Bond Girl, but Bond himself. To those who lament the old clich&eacute;s, Ty Burr of the Boston Globe offers this: \\"consider whether, after twenty-one Bond films and countless parodies, your response is simply Pavlovian.\\" Grow up. Bond has.r sketch of him, calling him on his hubris and ego, and essentially outbluffing him:    \\"By the cut of your suit you went to Oxford or wherever and actually think human beings dress like that.

B000002A46|5.0|This is by far the most enjoyed CD I've ever purchased!  Mariah Carey  has an incredible voice.  Each selection has special meaning for me and enjoyment!  I play this CD often -- at work, in my car and home.  It's soothing, comforting and relaxing.  I can't begin to describe how this CD puts me in a special mood!  Throughout the holiday season, I've noticed the radio stations and stores play several selections from this CD.  A real testimony to a great artist!  I plan on expressing these sentiments to Mariah Carey.  This is going to be a seasonless CD I plan on playing often right into the next season.  I never tire of listening to this CD.  Its messages are profound!      THANX, MARIAH FOR SHARING YOUR MELODIOUS VOICE!  I'll be purchasing her other CDs.  Mariah apparently sings from the heart and life experiences!

It's amazing how many details of the show I had forgotten all ready during the layoff between seasons.  Between rewatching the episodes and the extra flashbacks it's got me hyped up that much more for Season 4 to start!

0810993139|5.0|I have a nine year old son who does not like to read.  Diary of A Wimpy Kid is funny and has lots of illistrations. The author, Jeff Kinney knows his audience well, and has a knack of keeping kids into the story. The book talks about Greg Heffley, who is a middle child. Life events don't often go his way, and the situations he finds himself in are hilarious!! Even adults would think this book is funny!!! This book is a light read. I think most kids that read well and are at least in Third Grade could handle.  I could not believe that my son was choosing to read this book over playing his Wii. You can be sure I will be purchasing the follow up books to Diary of a Wimpy Kid!!!!

Over the years, I've had the great pleasure of listening to some of the loveliest music courtesy of Diana Krall, who instantly became one of my favorite jazz artists after listening to one of her most remarkable and well-produced CDs, [[ASIN:B00000J7S8 When I Look in Your Eyes]], the only Diana Krall CD that won the Grammy awards for the \\"Best Jazz Vocal Performance\\" in 1999, and was nominated for \\"Album of the Year.\\" On the cover story of More Magazine, November 2007 issue written by Susan McClelland, she indicated that it was the \\"first time that a jazz singer has received such a nod since Ella Fitzgerald, 25 years earlier.\\" It's a fact, [[ASIN:B00000J7S8 When I Look in Your Eyes]] is truly the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me from all of her albums, and that nomination proved it.<br /><br />Her follow-up CD, [[ASIN:B00005N9CV The Look of Love]], recorded in 2001 is also my top favorite and sold 3.5 million copies. This album, \\"Love Scenes,\\" recorded in 1997 comes close to the aforementioned CDs in terms of beauty and appeal to the listeners. Both albums also received Grammy nominations.<br /><br />Although she doesn't have the embellishment of a full orchestra in this recording, she does justice to every song she artfully interprets with the backing of two of the most trusted names in jazz instrumentations whose chops are always flawless and spectacular - guitarist Russell Malone and bassist Christian McBride.<br /><br />Whether she's singing my all-time favorite gems \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me,\\" \\"You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me\\" and \\"How Deep Is The Ocean\\" or the less popular ones such as \\"I Miss You So,\\" \\"Gentle Rain\\" and \\"My Love Is,\\" she exudes confidence and lends elegance and sweet sophistication to each rendition to attain the album's theme of a warm musical romance.<br /><br />This CD is a winner and a keeper!

075640407X|3.0|I know this book is touted as of interest to Harry Potter fans, but parents should be warned that this is definitely an adult novel.  Within the first 100 pages there are a half-dozen snide remarks about prostitutes, a portion of a pornographic song about prostitutes, and a pornographic joke about prostitutes.  The only female character within those 100 pages is the protagonist's mother who is the sterotypical 1950's mother who is kind, nurturing, and not too bright.  Her favorite pose is cuddled beneath the protecting arm of her macho husband. Apparently, the poor author thinks that there are only two types of women in the world--mothers and prostitutes.    Thank goodness J.K. Rowling is so far above such superficial and infantile concepts of women.

I know that romance is appealing to the audience, but seriously-you can overdo it. Also, it's like at the ending of the season they show you how the show is going to end after getting off the island. Jack is a drunk and Kate is with a different guy, but we don't even know if it's Sawyer. It makes you not even want to watch the next season.

B00125JP1C|3.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely. As I see it, the movie can work on two levels: (1) as a pure action film with very little brains, and/or (2) as a sly send-up of the action genre. For movie buffs, the chance to see Paul Giamatti as the bad guy is worth the price of admission all by itself. Action scenes are so over the top that there is no possibility of confusing the movie with reality, even Hollywood reality. So if you're an action junkie you're in for a treat. If you like seeing references to other films, you'll probably have a great time. If you are not in either of these camps, this film might not be for you.    Gave it three stars because its appeal is not universal.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|This collection of Friends \\"The Complete Series Collection\\" in the red box is Great! I am very happy with the the set.  It came in a great collecoter box along with a book and breakdown of each show.  This is a must have for true Friends fans!
B000VECAEO|5.0|Good stuff to have because it is great entertainment to go along with the other eight seasons.  We will watch them for years to come.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|Personally I believe HD DVD's are absolutely the best way to see a movie at home. This series \\"The Bourne Trilogy\\" is fantastic. Hopefully in the future many new HD DVD's will be available.
B000VECAEO|5.0|i bought it so my husband will have a complete set..Him and our boy are very much attached to it...so im giving the highest rate
B000WQW988|5.0|This is a must have for any music lover.  Even if you don't like Kurt Cobain, its a great watch.
B000P12LWY|1.0|I was very disappointed with the DVD set. I loved the series on Showtime and saw all the \\"making of\\" types of features, so naturally I preordered the set. Not a single episode had audio commentary. The bonus features were  previously aired episodes of Californication, Penn & Teller's BS, and This American Life. The other features (such as a Tudor London tour) had already been available as Showtime filler.
0439882826|5.0|This was a terrific fun gift for Christmas.  Everyone wanted to look at it and it got passed all around.  Well made, amazingly detailed, a delight..
0439813786|5.0|I love this!  It's a combination of written words and beautiful pencil drawing.  The drawings don't illustrate the text as much as they move the plot along - you'll see the boy following someone, from one place to the next, until that is done.  Then back to written text.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  Most graphic novels I've seen are more comic-book like, where the action and words are combined. It also has quite a bit of history, particularly French film history. that is interesting and well done.  (It's not meant to be non-fiction, but you learn about things along the way.)  I read it all at one sitting.  Highly recommended for almost everyone!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I absolutely loved this comedy/love story.  It shows compassion and personal growth and acceptance.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought 7 copies of Planet Earth, The Complete BBC Series for Christmas presents for families. I had seen it on Oprah, and I knew the series from living in the UK on and off for the last 20 years. It is an amazing series, beautifully shot, commentary by a master in this field, David Attenbough, and the music from the BBC orchestra suits the films perfectly. Everyone I gave them too seemed genuninely over the moon to receive as a present. I bought one for myself too and watch it often. The packaging is very classy too with photo's and descriptions of each DVD front and back. If you are looking for a nature show that is above the ordinary, then this is the one for you!!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Fast shipping, brand new Series 3 disc set from New Zealand, so region 4. No problem for us here in Ireland with a region-free DVD player.
B000AP04NI|5.0|We are trying to replace things we lost during Katrina.  We lost the movie and the album.  This helps restore some of the lost items.  It is also a classic movie and we love it.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This movie is a terrific 'episode' to the Firefly series. I only hope that it's not the last one we see. What an absolute shame that would be! The character interplay, the story lines, the ship (Serenity), the visuals, the dialog, the antagonists, the adventures...EVERYTHING in this series/movie makes for an on-going first-rate sci-fi adventure of the highest calibre!!    Joss Whedon, the visionary genius behind Firefly & Serenity, has my everlasting thanks and unending admiration for his exemplary work with this project. Proof of my conviction: If you want any of my Firefly/Serenity DVD's - and I have them ALL - you will have to tear them from my cold dead hands OR show me a signed contract proving COMPLETE financial backing to Joss's next episode(s)!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is my favorite all time movie! I wish I was George Bailey and was able to help as many people. That being said, I own 6 copies of this movie on tape and DVD. This new colorized version is probably the best of the bunch but the colors are still a little off. My husband and I always watch this movie a few times before Christmas and have just started sharing it with our two young sons. They prefer the color version but you know kids, they have no appreciation for old black & white! They are amazed when we tell them about the television stations ending their broadcasting each night, TV antennas, having to change the channel by hand and not paying for TV!   The black and white version is good too. I would recommend this movie to any die hard fans or folks looking for a wonderful movie, wonderfully restored!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I totally related to this movie.  Everyone has seen this, and knows it's great.  I bought this for a friend for Christmas, I know she'll enjoy it.
B00000F14B|5.0|We are still replacing things we lost during Katrina.  This movie is such a delight, we had to replace it.  Over 2 years after the Hurricane and people are still replacing things.  It may be a small thing, but it is just as important to us as any other.
B000000OU0|5.0|I bought this album originally after the 1994 reunion tour when I saw them live in New Orleans.  I wore it out.  Since you can't buy a digital download of this album, I bought it to add to my Ipod.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a wonderful set of DVD's. I would suggest anyone buy this that loves nature channel programs.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The best nature video I have ever seen. My 7 and 2 year olds saw part of this on TV and we had to have it. There are 5 DVDs and it is nicely broken up into sections so you can watch parts of it on different days but you can be so enthrolled with it, you could end up watching it for hours. Never boring, they have watched it again and again and always learn something different.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I bought this for my step-father for Christmas. It was new as promised and the shipping cannot be beat!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I have no idea why this show is not regarded as classic TV or why I had never heard of it until the DVD came out.  This release consists of musical highlights intercut with not-very-enlightening interviews, rather than of full episodes, but the music is fantastic.    I am guessing that, if you are reading this, you are the kind of person who will feel incomplete until you actually hear Johnny Cash and Louis Armstong play together, and you will not be disappointed when you do.  Ray Charles turns in an incredible performance.  Check out everyone from Neil Young to Tammy Wynette too.    Amazingly, you can hear mistakes and out of tune guitars, because the performances were actually recorded live.  Try that on MTV.
0740748475|5.0|These books are great. I bought them as a gift from my husband.  He is an avid Calvin & Hobbes fan and he has wanted them for a long time now.  They are a great collection.
B000VECAEO|5.0|[[ASIN:B000VECAEO Seinfeld - Season 9]]The final season will leave you wishing they would do just one more. The 1 hour and final show is a must have, it is full of the classic characters doing what they did best. The scene where Georges mum offers favours to the judge, because George is realy a good boy always cracks me up. My kids and I will watch it over and over until its worn out.
B0000542D1|5.0|This is a quick review of the VHS - the DVD seems to be taking a trouncing here.      At any event, \\"A Hard Days' Night\\" is a good-time movie, one of the best ever made.   I love every part of it - the songs, the rapid-fire Liverpool banter, and of course the boys themselves before they grew beards - so incredibly young and carefree.    And don't forget Wilfrid Brambell - that very clean little old man.  As we all know, he belongs to Paul.
1596680296|5.0|If you have never knitted socks or are befuddled by pattern instructions, you will truly benefit from this book.  I've read quite a few sock books and patterns and this, although a bit homely and with only a few, basic styles, will really kick-start your sock knitting career with its extremely clear illustrations and written instructions.  This book will teach you most of what you need to know to knit ANY sock pattern.
0740748475|5.0|Product is wonderful and in brand new condition. Arrived within the same week as ordering. It is incredibly heavy, but there's nothing that can be done about that.
0439882826|5.0|very cool book.  Craziest pop up book I've ever seen.  Well worth it.
B000W04S6U|5.0|i paid for 2-5 bus day shipping and two weeks later i finally received it.  i wouldnt order from this person again solely based on that.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|First of all, as a cute chick flick, I suppose this rates right up there.   The story is cute, the main characters are cute, and the premise of running off on holiday to assuage romantic heartbreaks is cute.  With all the cuteness out of the way,  the film is entertaining and has some memorable lines like \\"boob graze\\" and \\" I haven't been busy since 1978.\\"  It has a curl up and watch feel that a lot of chicks will love.  By no means is it meant to be an exercise in intellectual stimulation and it only asks you to fall in love with Iris' cottage and Amanda's mansion and to believe that Grahams really do exist.   It proves that bad boyfriends and girlfriends can't change and that everything is solved by simply moving on.  Kate and Rufus' talents were only taken lightly and Jude Law just had to look pretty and cheerful.  Cameron was, well, Cameron and Jack was just another version of Jack.  But something makes you like the movie despite the drawbacks.   Ladies, enjoy watching and being transported away from your daily grind.  As noted, Rufus Sewell gets the extra star for simply showing up.  Maybe Eli Wallach can share it with him.   Fun and light, but definitely not the best ever romantic comedy.
0765310015|1.0|When I first read Gardens of the Moon, I was overwhelmed at first with the atmosphere and the pacing. After another reread about a year later, however I was not so impressed. With the freshness of reading it again, I remembered the difficulties of reading it, the strangeness of what was going on, the lack of characterization, and why I initially liked it: I had read the gist of some plot spoilers which sounded really cool and spurred me to read further in lieu of what I was going for. I remember now how dull it all seemed and why I was able to get through in the first place was due to several false starts that made things seem somewhat familiar and not so much hard going.    The story involves the Malazan Empire, which has recently suffered from a coup and is now led by a new empress, continuing the worldwide conquest started by the previous emperor. Their latest target is the city of Darujhistan (Erikson has quite a penchant for silly names). But as they march upon it, they must deal with strange mystical forces as well as mercenaries hired by the opposition which just so happen to be in cahoots with the strange mystical forces to some extent. The focus is not on politics but on the soldiers which is a unique but failed attempt on Erikson's part. Something that is particularly absurd is when you're getting attached to the first set of soldier main characters, you're whisked away to Darujhistan and their inhabitants, with no regard for the soldiers.     At first, Erikson does a good job of establishing atmosphere and pacing. You get the feeling that this world is dark and he throws you right into the middle of it with confidence, instead of explaining everything right then and there so you can figure things out for yourself. If things are simple enough, this works.    However this is not a simple work. So many names and locations are tossed around that you won't know who they are or care but these names are vital to understanding the story which is terribly tragic.Sometimes the characters go on and on about Character X or Place Z but the uninitiated reader won't find much to grasp or root for. Events also happen that are strange and confusing and sometimes seem completely disconnected from others but actually are subsequently attached to each other. This is a terrible method of writing and is determined to confuse the average reader.    The magic system and surrounding phenomena is more of just like that: Phenomena. Events happen at random with little to no explanation and magic is flown through all over the place enough to cause doubt as to whether Erikson has any connection to reality aside from playing with his D&D campaigns. For example, a demi-god slays some monster about to kill a human and seals their soul inside another dimension. The human touches the corpse that had its soul sucked and is instantly transported to the dimension. Weird right? Gets much worse. Said human gets out by having a fight with a god with the outcome being the god freeing the human for...well no reason. Take things as they are because you're not getting an explanation.    Many compare Erikson to Homer but this is a grave insult to the Greek bard. The characters are often flat with little to no personality and compensate with this by having ludicrously amazing magic powers. The gods and other immortals also walk the earth in ludicrously high numbers and are more memorable than the mortal characters simply because they look cool or can kick tons of tail. This is strange, as there are times when the gods bow down to the mortals and help them out even though they have no reason to. The result is that the gods don't seem like gods but just people with lots of magic power and you feel underwhelmed. The gods' constantly bowing down to mortals for no reason also works well for when Erikson can't think of a creative way to get his characters out alive and has to resort to a deus ex machina.    Characterizations are also terrible and inconsistent. All the characters talk like embittered, grizzled mercenaries without any appropriate action or back story to care for them. Except for Kruppe, who is as transparent as they come since he is a strange, eccentric fellow, and in a world like this where magic is everywhere and the gods are constantly afoot, it becomes pretty obvious that his eccentricity is just for show. Erikson's narrative voice realizes his limits in characterization and actually has the gall to tell us how cool some characters are. There are also some strange and outrageous decisions done by total strangers to each other as in two strangers doing each other with barely any lively interaction, several hundred pages later one of them croaks and the other is extraordinarily miserable after learning about this, to illustrate a worse subplot. This problem extends itself beyond contrived melodrama to plot problems such as Exhibit A: There are a group of characters portrayed as heartless and relentless crusaders. One of their recruits is a little girl who seems possessed by Satan and rings all types of red flags with the wizards. If this is the case, uh, why not kill her? You are battle-hardened crusaders right? Of course this conclusion is unacceptable for Erikson to take considering the weight of this plot now and what it plays out in later books. Sure Erikson could try a different plot but when the author is apathetic to real human interactions and psychology and only concerned with his creation's complex world building and convoluted plot lines, what do you expect?    The prose is nefariously juvenile. It's obvious Erikson is trying to set dark tone and atmosphere but it reads like bad fan fiction without description of the setting. The first paragraph is solely devoted to the details of a ghoulish weather vane. The ridiculous font used for the chapters and sections dividing the book only reinforce this notion. Characters rarely say things but always growl and grunt as in, \\"Here you go,\\" growled Whiskeyjack, or, \\"She was nice,\\" grunted Paran. Sometimes instead of a name, Erikson substitutes some generic moniker as in, \\"Here you go,\\" growled the grizzled veteran (instead of Whiskeyjack). Wow, Whiskeyjack is a grizzled veteran? I couldn't figure that out at all from the story, Erikson!    Apologists often answer to these criticisms, stating the complexity and intensity of the world building, which is a valid defense in the book's ambition and favor but doesn't address the storytelling problems. Another problem is that the complex world building could have been exchanged with good storytelling and I wouldn't lament the loss of the former in the slightest. The complexity is really random stuff happening without reason for you to care and the scope of this book alone doesn't amount to much anyway. The real complexity, I think in the minds of the apologists, is how the books are saturated with magic and the gods and how nothing is explained at first. You can reason it out on your own but it requires going back several hundred pages and picking out the most minute detail to attention and through these conclusions, you realize how silly the books really are. Not fun.    Many have said that the series gets better several books in after this one since things start to make sense. This is strange since I shouldn't have to read several books for things to make sense or interest me. Speaking of interest, that's largely the main problem. Other authors have managed to make surreal, confusing stories while still making them interesting by appealing to a reader within the first hundred pages. On the other hand, this book starts getting fun (and barely starts getting comprehensible to boot) around the halfway point. Why bother if I have to wait that long?
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Not only was Love Actually a great heartfelt feel good movie, but the soundtrack is also great! It made a great Christmas gift for some family members and they all appreciated it. Songs from Joanie Mitchell, Kelly Clarkson and others, are all great.
0740748475|5.0|I remember these strips as I was going through my high school years and so much of what happened then were made easier by these books. If you need something to shake the \\"serious\\" out of life and remember the creativity and fun of just being a kid, these are the books for you.
B000006TRV|5.0|The last Pink Floyd album with Roger Waters.  A Sweet remastered edition that all Pink Floyd fans should have in their colection. Truly a band that introduced a NEW and ground breaking sound to Rock & Roll and changed the music world with a sound that is timeless.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This was truly a fine dvd purchase. Unfortunately I recieved it nearly 3 weeks AFTER Amazon told me I would which made one of my XMas gifts extremely awkward and lame.   Thanks Amazon!  You're lame.
B000P0J0G0|2.0|For those used to the brilliant writing of either Jeeves & Wooster or House M.D., this series will be a serious disappointment.  Though sometimes genuinely funny, it sadly relies on profanity and sexual humor far too much of the time.
B000003N7K|4.0|I'm not a reviewer I'm a just lover of Jazz, Old and New, and I am trying to turn my Cassettes into CD's, I wish there was a trade-in for the old cassettes so I could afford to get more CD's. This CD is one of the Best!  With two of the Greatest Jazz-Men of all time, If you love SMOOTH JAZZ this is for you....eb48.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|As a lot of professional movie reviewers have said, \\"Bullitt\\" is not an instantly easy film to understand.  The plot is slightly disjointed, but repeated viewings make all the nuances fall into place.  Steve McQueen, however, is at his absolute \\"Cool\\" best!  Whether verbally sparring with co-star Robert Vaughn, or chasing \\"Johnny Ross\\" across the tarmac of the San Francisco airport, McQueen (as Lieutenant Frank Bullitt) is a movie star as they are supposed to be.    I owned a 1968 Dodge Charger when the film first opened.  I firmly believe the car chase in \\"Bullitt\\" is the finest ever filmed, and a wide-screen format is a must for anyone wanting to experience what movie-goers did when the film was released.  This car chase allows \\"Bullitt\\" to essentially have two climaxes, and both will keep you glued to your seat.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This album contains some of the best music I've ever heard(not only in metal music, but in general). This is a very truly talented band, and all their other albums are amazing too.<br />I truly recommend to give them a listen, you will not be dissappointed.<br />Five stars to this one.
0765357151|4.0|It's been made into many movies - here in its original form, and a great concept that is revealed at the end.
B000NY133G|1.0|i admit that i could not get past the foreword because it contains language idolizing this &#34;secret&#34; but i gathered from the other reviews that there are some useful ideas in the text
B000002LK1|5.0|I ordered this album for my husband for Christmas, knowing we liked Enjoy the Silence.  Its not very often there is a group that I enjoy listening to every track on their album, but this band is one of the exceptions.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|It was very hard to find the movies at local retailers so I was so excited to find the whole set for only $20.  And it was delivered within 3 days of ordering it, just in time for Christmas!
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game, truly, takes minutes to learn, but I don't know that a lifetime would lead to mastery.  The beauty of this game is that it's simple enough for our almost-5-year-old to play and enjoy, but has enough complexity that the most analytically minded gamer can easily wrap their mind around.    It is a great game for only 2 or 3 players (though all four colors have to be played every game), but the most enjoyment comes when 4 players are found who get into the details and try to define a strategy.    The four player mode is where this game shines - unless each player places the exact pieces in the exact order EVERY TIME, it is ALWAYS a different game.    If you can find someone insane enough to part with this game used, at a discount, don't hesitate to make the purchase.  We love this enough that we're going to be buying it as gifts for the rest of our family!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Purchasced this for my husband for Christmas.  He watched it and said it was \\"excellent\\".  Thanks, Dottie
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|One of the best musicals I have ever seen, both original and top notch folksy/rock music with classical elements.  Glen and Marketa are refreshing together and my whole family has turned into Swell Season and Frame fans to the point of attending their live concerts which are also awesome.  This is the organic format future musicals should be using.  An incredible first film.  If only there could be a TWICE.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|I bought this album after reading the stellar reviews that were posted here, and I have to say that I wasn't quite as blown away as some other people were, but it definitely is a good hard rock album. It's not really anything different, but it's not completely unoriginal. The best way I can describe this album is Seether, Shinedown, Breaking Benjamin, Nickelback and a little bit of Creed all wrapped into one. The lead singer sounds exactly like what combining those of Seether and Shinedown would sound like. There are harder, more Metallica-like songs along with slower more grungy songs as well.     The absolute best song that I mainly bought the album for is the first one \\"Ties That Bind.\\" I have to say that is one of the most awesome songs of 2007...very heavy, very catchy and very different. If you don't love that song and/or get it stuck in your head there is something wrong with you. The other stand-out tracks are \\"Buried Alive\\", \\"Coming Home\\", \\"Blackbird\\" [very beautiful and powerful song], \\"White Knuckles\\" and the very sad \\"Wayward One.\\" All of the songs have a little bit different sound, but the entire album maintains the general Shinedown/Seether sound. Still a great and solid album and I am by no means accusing them of copying anyone. They still have their own sound and have assembled a few insanely good songs here as well as a few duds, like the horribly corny \\"Brand New Start\\" and the blatant Nickelback ripoff \\"Rise Today.\\" And \\"Watch Over You\\"...forget it...ridiculously annoying and way too much country for my taste. I definitely would have liked the album a lot more if those certain tracks weren't included.    Overall, if you like the Seether sound with a little something different [and sometimes a little harder] thrown in...buy this album. If you like good solid ROCK...buy this album. It's a good album and is one of the better albums of the year, but it definitely isn't as amazing as some people make it out to be [in my opinion]. It would have been MUCH better if they had committed more to their amazing heavy sound that resonates throughout songs like \\"Ties That Bind\\", \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"White Knuckles.\\" More songs like those would have helped make it even better. But it is a good hard rock album nonetheless.
B000BCE918|5.0|If you like the movie this is the way to own it. All three movies in one fine presentation.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is a masterfully written series.  The sub-plots are enticing and hard to predict which is why this is the ultamate serial show.  Although one cannot watch the third season of LOST with having seen the first two seasons this show is a must see.      The flashbacks allow us to understand the characters in a more dynamic way which then transcends to the island.      Season 3 is much better when watched in its entirety from episode 1 through to the end.  My whole family loved to watch this program and we constantly fought over the meaning of the different character pieces and what will happen next. We were sad when the last episode ended as that meant we had nothing to watch the next evening.  We wait with baited breath for season 4.
0143038419|5.0|I've been on the path of self-discovery for a few years. Sometimes, I get stuck. This book has put me back on the good path. It has been very comforting to me. I have read it more than once and lent it to friends.
B000I0QK74|5.0|With Dave Grusin's production, arrangement, and keyboard contributions, this CD really hits the mark. James Taylor is clearly comfortable with collaborative work and continues to make great choices with his musicians. The choice of songs on this CD should please anyone who wants to celebrate the holidays. I find myself wanting to listen to this one all year long!
B0009MAO46|5.0|I bought this for christmas as a present for my three year old, and he absolutley loves it.  I had seen it when it first came out and it is still a feel good movie, it just brings back memories.  Must have for any kids collection.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|No need to review the film.  Yes, it's amazing.      I was very impressed with just how much is in the five disc set.  There is more in there than you could imagine. You get all the previous releases in HD as well!  And, since it's HD, all three of those previous releases fit on one disk.  Pretty cool.       If only Emperor Lucas would come down from his ivory tower and give us the original Star Wars movies in an HD format.    The visual quality of the HD version is unbelievable.  I endured this movie on VHS.  It looked like it was filmed in fog.  It was obviously way ahead of the current technology.  HD does this film proud.    Now it looks as good as it really was all along.    Kudos to Philip Dick for such a compelling story.  Can you believe he wrote that in the late 60's?  What a wonderfully insightful imagination?
B000B8QG0O|5.0|Must have for any kids collection.  Only setback is I have had to watch it over ten times in the past 2 weeks, that's how much my kid liked it, he is only 3.

B000F3AB0Q|5.0|I heard a cut from the album Old New Ballad Blues [[ASIN:B000F3AB0Q Old New Ballads Blues]] on Pandora.  I loved it, so I order the CD.  It is excellent and contains some songs I hadn't heard before.  I recommend this album if you love the blues.
1401308201|5.0|My daughters and I went to see Wicked in November and we had so many questions about the story (I had read the book) and the show.  The kiosks at the show were selling 'The Grimmerie', but I didn't see it.  So, when I did a search on Amazon and came across this book, I ordered it for my daughters for Christmas.    When the book was delivered, I was so impressed with its quality and inital appearence.  The image doesn't do the book justice, but the cover is padded and 'faux distressed' to make is look like it had been discovered well-worn in someone's attic. I had to touch it several times because it looked as if it was very textured, but wasn't.  The pages are antiqued with lots of artwork and detail - much like a fine manuscript.      I flipped through the entire book the first night and LOVED it - so much, I didn't want to give it up!!     The book has a lot of history about the origin and development of the original show, interviews and pictures of original cast members, lyrics from songs, script excerpts, meanings behind some of the props and lots of behind the scenes information (like how the green makeup stays on the Alphaba).    Needless to say, my daughters consumed this book.  They look at it almost every day.  It will be a treasured addition to our library.  (Notice I said 'OUR' and not 'THEIR'- LOL)    If you saw the show, don't hesitate to buy the book!
B000XA5K48|2.0|I was expecting something along the lines of Crank and Smokin' Aces, two other over-the-top action movies that I actually enjoyed, but Shoot 'em Up left me disappointed.  This flick still had all the action that you can squeeze into an action movie and then some but, while taken to excess, it wasn't as engaging or interesting as the two previous movies and the acting was so bad it actually hurts to watch (except for Paul Giammani, who I enjoyed).    Now I understand that Shoot 'em Up is supposed to be a bizarre, over-the-top  movie where action reigns supreme and things like plot, scripting and acting are second seat but the action itself wasn't enough for this movie to stand on.  Nothing about it was new, innovative or engaging, it was just dumb, balls-to-the-walls stupidity and I don't know if that was by design or not.  It is quite possible that I just missed what the movie was trying to be...
B000GH3CVQ|1.0|This is second CD I have purchased of Hansard and Marketa.<br />First was soundtrack of the movie ONCE. I believe it is rated by<br />New Yorker in top hundred best sound tracks of films Just beautiful.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I got this for my 17 year old son for Christmas.  He has loved it.  It has a lot of action.  The character development is very good.
B00005LC1H|5.0|The first order for Fawlty Towers was due to be received on December 19.  It did not arrive.  I contacted Amazon.  A second order was sent and was received on December 24 (in time for Christmas).  I received the first order on January 3 and contacted Danielle at Amazon.  She e-mailed a new address label and the package was mailed back to Amazon on January 4.  Danielle was very helpful.  Thank you.
1400103789|5.0|It is not interesting that one of the most influential things for how a human being lives their life (circumscribed to religion) is usually left to others to handle, and the human being just goes along with it all.  This book puts you in control of your beliefs.  It's written in easy, light, almost conversational tone.  It's comical at times.  Mr. Dawkins has put together many of the conclusions to which I have arrived on my own, but has provided sequences, both historically and logically, needed to explain them to anyone - really just about anyone.  I recommend this book to everyone who wants to find out more about belief and disbelief.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My parents got a 56\\" TV so I got them this series as a gift.  Everyone who walks by the TV ends up sitting down and not blinking until the episode is over.  I like the BBC narrator a little better than the American gal, but be aware that all of the measurements are metric (ie. these grow to over 3 meters long. etc.) Also, as great as the shots are, they don't jump off of the screen like an HD-DVD would, but I think it would help if we hooked up the DVD player with an HDMI cable.  To the people who are offended by the \\"brutality\\" this is a nature documentary, that is how nature is. Deal with it.
0740748475|5.0|One of my greatest regrets was when Calvin & Hobbes were stopped.    No I can enjoy them at my liesure.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I saw before buying this serie and i can say this is the best serie a never see about WW2. All chapter is based on a true history about a one company in this case the Easy Company.    I recommend this movie, the price is low, this case have 6 discs, the disc 6  is a extra feature. All chapters of this is really amazing.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Since I gave this item as a gift I can't give it a fair review, but I can say that my mother was very pleased to receive it and is enjoying it.
0859538877|4.0|My daughter aged 2, loves this book, she sings along and loves turning the pages and looks forward to the party at the end.
B00003CXA2|5.0|what a groovy seller! i was taken care of with no questions asked and received immediate responses! thanks!
B000002UAX|5.0|This came to me in very good shape.  I have been enjoying it alot.  I am proud to own it.
0740748475|5.0|I have always loved Calvin and Hobbes and it is fantastic to now have the complete series all together in such a wonderfully presented collection.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Most of this movie is watching people playing music - so be prepared that you'll keep hitting 3-minute songs.    For me, the movie was entertaining, realistic (non-Hollywood blockbuster), and the music was inventive, heartfelt, and sorrowful.    A movie of this type is normally done as a \\"slice of life\\" without much of a beginning or ending, but this movie has some inciting forces, movement, and subtle closure.    You probably need to be somewhat of a music fan to enjoy this movie, but I ended up watching it twice (which I never do) in order to follow the progression of the songs.
0439882826|5.0|A freind bought one and I found it magnificent. I had to have one. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan or are looking for a unique gift for one, this is it.
B000W07EKW|4.0|THE BOURNE TRILOGY WAS JUST WHAT MY FATHER WANTED FOR CHRISTMAS.... AND WE CAN BORROW THEM.  WE THINK THE MOVIES ARE GREAT INDIVIDUALLY, BUT THIS WAY WE CAN SEE THEM ALL.
0143038419|1.0|I want to express my thanks to the reviewers here who managed to soothe my Gilbert battered soul. This woman conveys about as much spirituality as the weeds in my garden. Somehow I did manage not to contribute one cent to her pocket, got it from the library, and then insisted I see it through to give the presumed knowledgeable reviewers a chance. I have generally viewed them with some skepticism, much preferring reader reviews to the \\"experts.\\" I think I'm vindicated.    By the time this con artist wants us to believe that she finds \\"love\\" between the sheets and commonplace lust and sex, I was ready to pay my own price on the bathroom floor. Now she is apparently writing a book about marriage. Will the public wake up to this cheat posing as a writer only to end up demeaning the written word and our intelligence?    The good that can come of this is that we may just turn into our own reviewers and learn to see through the deception, hype, and hoopla.
B000Y179KO|4.0|Hard to believe they still have the same sound as when they first became a group.  Of course, they are older and some of their voices can't hit all the notes but you will not be disappointed.  It is still easy to pick out each performer when they sing individually.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I bought this dvd for my husband. The quality and content  was far more than I expected.  Well worth the purchase.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|If you love Bruce Willis action movies, you will love this one.  No one does it more \\"over the top\\" than he does!
B000W4HJ44|1.0|I bought this as a gift and when we went to play the DVD it was blank! Worse yet, it would freeze up my DVD player every time I would try to access the menu. I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to return it for a full refund because the package has been opened.    I don't think I'll ever buy a DVD from here again. Lousy product. Waste of money.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for someone else and I think he liked it...I, on the other hand, did not. I just don't think she's very special in  terms of her voice, her style, her phrasing...anything really. She is a beautiful woman and looks great on the cover, but you have to like listening to classic songs getting revamped for no reason.
B000W9DSVW|3.0|Ocean's Eleven a very noisy picture and although better than my DVD copy, it falls far short of what Blu-Ray can offer. Good plot and good acting.  Ocean's Twelve is much better Blu-Ray quality, but the film production is highly stylized and distracting, rather 60's in the way they use different transitions, cuts and grotesque zooms. The plot is much weaker - and far less plausible - than Eleven, and the acting rather wooden at times.  I haven't watched Thirteen yet, but hope it is the movie caliber of Eleven with the Blu-Ray quality of Twelve.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|A great movie based on a great book.  (Book is not for young children, however.)
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Love it.  It was here in no time and had family over to watch it over dinner.
0143038419|5.0|This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone searching for meaning in their life. It is thought provoking and often \\"spoke\\" directly to me and where I was at in life.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I ordered a movie for my son who is almost three. he loves Toy Story, but tends to ruin movies really fast (\\"Let me do it\\") anyway we received it brand new, fast , and half the price of anuyu store.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|As the title says:  this third installment in the Bourne series is as good, or better, than the first two.  Matt Damon is excellent and the story line advances without sacrificing the action sequences we have come to expect.  Great characters, lots of action and a good story!  What more could a movie goer ask for?
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|You'll wish your car had blinds because you'll catch yourself singing along with this cd. Great dance tracks also.If you're embarrassed just buy it and crank it in the privacy of your own home.
0761145613|5.0|My wife and I have four kids, so a calendar for our busy schedule is a necessity.  This is a nice calendar with lots of room to write appointments.  The only negative I can think of is there's only room for 4 kids.  So, people with more than four kids may have to improvise creative ways to get all the information on the calendar.
0143038419|2.0|I was very disappointed in the book especially after seeing the author on The Oprah Show. Most of the audience along with Oprah \\"gushed\\" over the book and I felt I just had to read it and give it to my daughter. I forced myself to read and finish it and wondered the whole time---what is the point???  Too much hipe!!!! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B000LPS4BG|3.0|The movie is excellent, so lets get that out of the way. Im only writing about the HD quality of the Blu-Ray transfer itself. I guess I was not blown away by this transfer.     Visually, the opening scene was not cleaned up and still has some film noise and white speckles. Color transfer appears fine, although not as vibrant as I would have thought. Audio again is just ok and nothing to get too excited about. I have not viewed the extra content, but it appears to be interesting and most of it may not be available on Special Edition DVD's.    When you spend more money than what you would on a regular DVD, you certainly expect the quality to be much higher. I have a 50inch Samsung FPT-5084 capable of 1080p and I use my PS3's Blu-Ray player, so I dont believe my setup is an issue.     After seeing 2001 on Blu-Ray, I know what kind of a mind blowing transfer is capable when the right people are on the task of doing it. Overall, I recommend sticking to the standard DVD version until a better transfer is available.
B000TFINY6|5.0|I pre-ordered this from Amazon before the release, and they shipped it two days after the release date.  It did not arrive until late in the following week.  Why pre-order if they are not going to ship it at least on the release date, if not before?  I paid $68 total, and it was selling at Best Buy for $120.  Great deal, but the shipping was horrible. Waiting arrival, I rented the first 3 discs from Blockbuster splitting the cost with a friend.<br /><br />The blu-ray set is great.  The box is sharp, and the disc case is a cool looking plastic flip-book. It looks great it HD.  The extras are great as well.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVED SERENITY. THIS IS IN MY TOP TEN MOVIES OF WHICH I HAVE EVER SEEN.FYI I AM 52 YEARS OLD, THAT'S ALOT OF MOVIES TO CHOOSE FROM. IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO VIEW ALL WHAT THE COLLECTORS EDITION EXTRAS. THIS MOVIE IS EXECELENT AS A STAND ALONE BUT YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND ALOT MORE ABOUT SERENITY BY VIEWING FIREFLY. YOU MUST CHECK THIS OUT.
B000TGCR3S|5.0|I bought this for a co-worker after renting it from Blockbuster.  If you are an anime lover, you should see this movie.  The visuals are stunning; the story and mythology are very intriguing.  I know Paprika got rave reviews, but this anime is so much better!  You'll fall in love with Black and White!
0321334876|4.0|A good book in an informal language to take a look at the most importance topics to avoid many common errors during the programming in C++. Widely used in the industry.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Always a family favorite with both young & old. Beautifully crafted, it withstands the test of time.
0143038419|2.0|This book has alot of bad language, and is not an easy book to get into and enjoy.
B000056HE9|5.0|Love this movie! It's not Christmas without it. Nostalgia with a moral. Well worth viewing.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Loreena McKennit's CD/DVD set Nights from the Alhambra is one of the most amazing performances I have ever heard.  The sound quality is incredible and having the DVD makes it feel like I am there.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|false dialogue, completely unrealistic story and pathetic character development    whats worse, i actually like all of the actors in this movie, i just can't understand how any director can make this appear so uncohesive    sorry hollywood.. perhaps stick to spiderman 5 or alien vs predator 4. romance is really not your thing on this one..
B000Y179KO|3.0|I must say that I was pretty psyched when I heard the new single, \\"How Long.\\" It really sounded like the boys in the band were having a good time making music again; something similar to when they were singing about that \\"girl in the flatbed Ford\\" in Winslow, Arizona.  When I listened to the whole CD, however, I found that I only liked about two or three other songs.  Believe me, being critical of these guys' music is hard to do; they practically wrote the soundtrack of my youth.  There are beautiful harmonies and echoes of CSNY on \\"No More Walks in the Wood,\\" and \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\" is a wonderful piece of music.  The rest of the album, however, is just too mellow.  I could actualy buy this brand of mellow if the guys were strumming acoustic guitars, but it sounds like they are playing muzak keyboards and getting ready to provide a dentist's office some tunes for denture patients.  I realized that friends of mine and other record reviewers were actually ahead of me in being fed up with the Eagles as the \\"masters of mellow\\" and several of my buddies didn't even want to waste the time to cue this one up.  Perhaps the Eagles need to go back and listen to the \\"Desperado\\" LP or take some day trips to their haunts in the Califonia desert to rekindle the flame that used to burn so bright.
B000SM7QUC|4.0|Okay, so this is no Pink Floyd \\"The Wall\\"! Or even a Queensryche, \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\", but hey, anyone who attempts to produce a concept ablum has to have something upstairs to stick with their vision.    Who would have guessed that Mr. Sixx would!? Perhaps if he hadn't been sticking his arm, he might have crafted better music back in the day with MC.    Seriously folks, the album contains very well written and produced music. Word of warning to the head hangers: this is not a hard rocking sortie, but rather a introspective journey out of addiction, think of it as a hard rocking Bon Jovi. Here's the highlights, some great heart beaters: Van Nuys, Life is Beautiful, Pray for Me, along with some melodic hummers: Tommorrow, Accidents Can Happen,Girl With the Golden Eyes, the ablum is defintely worth having.    For some reason, this addiction album seems to have what every addiction ablum has to have: voice overs, helicopter engines, telephone tones, loud door knocking and the finding the passed out body on the floor scene, but could we rockers have it any other way?!    Still a good listen, enjoy!
B00005JOHC|5.0|This show is the best. All of the characters on the show make it what it is, great. I recommend this to everyone.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|These guys are amazing.  I don't usually enjoy listening to music where I can't understand the words but with these 4 you get the feelings being expressed by the song even if you can't understand the words.  They aren't too bad to look at either.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Excellent movie. Once I watched it in the cinema I ordered to see it at home many times.
0517053616|3.0|Well, the book contents are strictly what the cover tells, there are no kind of studies or comments about Shakespeare's works, you will find only the pure texts of each story.<br />Other negative point of the book is its huge size, what makes the reading feasible probably only inside your house; and the tiny letters, what really handicaps the reading.<br />If you are not going to read every Shakespeare's work don't buy this book, prefer another one.
B000HIVIOW|3.0|This version of  THE SNOWMAN is not narrated by David Bowie. It is still an AWESOME  movie- I was expecting  David Bowie.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Both the movie and the special features are so excellent, so full of creative genius and fun, that we have watched them many times. In fact, my daughter had requested that I rent it so many times that I decided we should own it. The scenery is stunning, the filming is inventive and draws us into the scenes, and the plot retains the best elements of the really excellent book. Cuaron's direction inspires these great actors to be authentic to the beloved characters of the book. Some of the DVD games are a little squirrelly, but that is no surprise, and there are plenty more features to entice us, including a warm interview with the author, JK Rowling, and the director, Alphonso Cuaron(who also directed Y Tu Mama Tambien). Clearly everyone on the set is enamored of Ms. Rowling. Lots of detailed looks at set and scene construction are included...we were truly impressed with the effort and talent that went into this film. Plus it is funny, has a super interesting plot, and the acting/directing is marvelous. Of all of the (5) HP movies out as of this writing, this one is the one I will be happy to watch repeatedly, simply for its cinematic genius.
B00122O34O|5.0|Watched it last night @ 9:30pm and bought the album online this morning.   I read somewhere online that if you were 40 or older you would not like this movie, and I have to say like all Stereotypes of us \\"over 40\\" 1 step in the grave folks :( that is far from the truth!  Now I will admit that I felt I was out of my element cause the average age at the Movie's last night was closer to 19, and what I thought was funny, I sometime was the only one busting up laughing.... And when they played the Carpenter's Tribute of Superstar by Sonic Youth, I must have been the only one there who heard the original.  Kimya Dawson music, wow !  I feel so relaxed and yet energized when I hear it. :) .. and the rest of the music just fits w/ this great movie.      I can't wait till the DVD come's out, cause I'm sure i'll be buying it too.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This doll is darling!! She smells wonderful. My 18mo. daugher loves her. She is soft and cuddly.
0439882826|5.0|I bought this for my grandson, the book is awesome! Very detailed looks like it was made for an adult. He has to be very carefull with it and he is, he treasures it also ten dollars cheaper at Amazon.
0316286850|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who heard about it through another author.  She got it out of the library and kept bringing it back late so I decided she needed her own. She adores old movies and glamour of the old days.  She is just wild about this book.  She learned a lot about make-up and she has mastered quite a few of these styles herself.  It's a wonderful book.
0143038419|5.0|Exactly what the doctor ordered!  Liz Gilbert uses great humor to help me laugh my way to enlightenment.  Excellent.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|This is one great movie. It's one of Richard's and Elizabeth's best. I've never seen better acting in all my life and I've seen A LOT of movies. This is a must have.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Gave this box set to my parents for the holidays and they were so excited to get it.  Who wouldn't be?  The series is amazing.  You see things you've never seen before or will ever get an opportunity to see again.     It's a great gift for those who have everything because they would never have anything else like this!
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 is one of the most successful rock bands of all-time, and prior to 1987, built a strong foundation of deep, prophetic rock that touches the listener's soul. U2 has always been praised with their deep concern with the state of humanity and the planet we live on including efforts towards Amnesty International and the Live Aid and Live 8 concerts. The effort that ensued in the Joshua Tree is one of the most intelligently crafted, deep, meaningful and creative pieces of music ever created. U2 created this album as a tribute to the United States, and the freedom and beautiful land that it provides. The album never relinquishes its beauty, and sends chill through the air when the opening riff of \\"Where the Streets have no Name\\" echoes through the air. A magical achievement in music that few have equalled.
B000W745CU|4.0|JK does it again! She has created a ongoing story that we all hope doesn't end. Full of exciting pictures & words.
B00122O34O|4.0|The movie was awesome as was the soundtrack.  Download it, buy it, burn it from a friend.  It's good stuff.
0440238609|4.0|This fantasy series has something for everyone.  The characters are memorable and entertaining.  Although this series was written for young adults it can be enjoyed by all ages.
B000F8O2OM|3.0|Well this was a good surprise. Good quality DVD's. A might bit expensive for a show off the air, but not a surprise.    maybe one day the price for the full set will be a little more reasonable.
B000UR9T7I|3.0|This is the weakest of the Spiderman flicks. I was expecting more. But this film falls victim to the Hollywood sequal syndrome. That's where they have to make everthying bigger and pack more villains and action scenes in. Then there is the subplot of Mary Jane seeming to fall out of love with Spiderman and wanting to go off on her own. They spent way too much time on that. I found the whole concoction not to my liking. Also the Blu-Ray transfer looked cheap to me. I wouldn't want to show it to anyone unless they really asked to see it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a fantastic series.  It is informative and entertaining.  You are able to visit places on this beautiful Earth that you will otherwise never see!
B000VBJEFK|5.0|This is an absolutely gorgeous transfer from film to DVD in Blu-Ray. In fact, for now this is THE disk to put on to show off your home theater set-up. All of this is thanks to the beautiful rendering of the computer animation by Pixar. The story isn't the best, but the character development is excellent and well matched to the voice talent. The sound track is in TrueHD, and is magnficent. I can't speak too highly for this DVD in Blu-Ray.
0143038419|5.0|eat, pray, love by Elisabeth Gilbert is memorable from the first sentence. Never have read a book that says and describes people and things the way that I do. I felt as though I meshed with her and didn't want the book to end. So delightful! I'm counting the months to when her new book will be out. Thank you, thank you.
B000VNMMQ6|3.0|This is a pretty good film, and the transfer to Blu-Ray works beautifully. The sound is terrific, and it is fast moving. My problem is there are a couple of scenes which totally stretch reality to the breaking point. I like to let my skepticism go as much as anyone, but this film has some real deuseys. The above average Gladiator type would be hard pressed to live through this one. Justin Long held his end of the bargain playing a scared computer geek very well without going completlely over the top. I have to say it was probably second best of the Die Hard films. I can only give it three stars.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Our 12 year old daughter requested this for Christmas, having been introduced to the series many seasons later. She watched all 24 episodes over Christmas break and LOVED them!
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|Every one of the Bourne films is a masterpiece of photography, scripting, diorection, acting, and everything else you would want from a great film series. There's lots of action, but I don't believe the women will get turned off by it, and all the fights are totally believable because they are so well choreographed, and becuse Matt Damon is clearly in middle of them all. He creates a charater that is James Bond en extremis wothout going over the top with all that which wine with fish stuff, and which card goes where in Banco. I thoroughly enjoyed every second, and the supporting cast is first rate. Julia Stiles is enthralling in this one. It getts all five stars in my book as do the other two Bourne films.
0316010669|4.0|How do individuals in critical roles such as firemen, airline pilots and process plant operators make split-second decisions that happen to be correct most of the time?  And what causes them to make the wrong decision from time to time?  This book is filled with examples of what appear to be \\"gut feel\\" decisions that upon detailed examination prove to be the result of calculated situational assessments and analyses, all in a fraction of a second.  Gladwell attributes this phenomenon to the \\"unconscious\\" mind and its ability to process lots of input data rapidly to arrive at the right decision.       This is a must read for every engineer, designer, consultant and manager who is concerned with human performance.  It is a fun/fast read.    We in the processing industries operate on the belief that ALL accidents are preventable.  Given that all accidents - minor and catastrophic - can ultimately be traced back to human error at one point or another - either by neglecting to take action when necessary or taking the wrong action - it is imperative that professionals in the field of HUMAN PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT understand how critical decisions are made in an instant.  Particularly in the filed of process plant operations, where every year we still see accidents take lives and maim individuals, it is crucial that proper systems be put in place to support operators in their critical decision making process.  Two factors lead to making the correct decision during moments of chaos - the competency of the operator and the quality of the data presented to him.      The only criticism of this book (and why it did not get the 5 stars) is that it is very heavy on examples to prove its point and too light on measures to improve chances for better decision-making.
B000WQW988|5.0|For anyone who loved Nirvana and Kurt Cobain this is an awesome choice to have in your home.  Watching the dvd brought back memories of when I watched it live with my family.  If you are a Kurt Cobain fan, this is something that you must have.  I am in awe of it!
B000VBJEEG|2.0|This movie was highly recommended by everyone I knew who had seen it.  While the basic idea is cute and clever, it was beaten into the ground!  The movie was about a half hour too long.
0812550706|5.0|This is definitely my favorite book of all time. It does not have the most sophisticated plot or imagination, but that is the whole point of the book. It is written from children's point of view and explores the ethical dimensions of war, personal and societal. What is ethical for me to do when I am given these difficult conditions and no one can help me? How much can I ethically push a kid, even a genius, to save human kind? Exploration of these issues make Ender's game my favorite read. It really puts some perspective in my life at the ages of 17, 23, 27, and 32. And I expect that I will read it every couple of years for the rest of my life because I enjoy it so much.
B000026OW3|5.0|There may be better (according to your taste) individual recordings of Chopin's works contained in this set, but not that much better, and certainly not at this price. Artists such as Arrau (Etudes, which aren't in this set & his darker Nocturnes), Moravec's Ballades, Michelangeli's Sonata No.2, Kapell's Mazurkas & Pollini's Preludes come to mind. That being said, Rubinstein's interpretations of all of these works are also outstanding, and nobody can touch him on the Waltzes (well, maybe Lipatti). The only minor disappointment of this set is the subpar recording quality of the Preludes, but the playing of them is still very nice and quite listenable. If you don't already own these works, this is definately the place to start (especially at less than $3 a CD), and if you don't know Rubinstein's sophisticated and aristrocratic readings of Chopin, you must see what you're missing. Highly recommended.<br /><br />**At the time I printed this review the price was $27.99**
0316287059|5.0|I purchased 5 different books in this category.  This was by far the most inclusive.  I immediately starting using the techniques and was amazed by the difference.  The book is easy to follow.  I recommend it to everyone who wants to learn how to put their best Face Forward.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My boyfriend loved it as a Christmas gift, and I've actually been enjoying watching the discs with him.  The series was very well done.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Relevance is important.  Music in our time must be listened to in order to sort traditions and gain perspective.  The Swedish band Opeth has achieved a classic work in \\"Ghost Reveries\\" and they've done so outside the mainstream of the metal hierarchy.  In so doing this band has made itself relevant!  All of the \\"serious\\" music of North Americans has deep roots in the European tradition, and this includes the Classical and the Metal genres.  Ghost Reveries is not some empty, head banging gesture- rather, it boasts achingly beautiful melodic lines, with clean and lyrical vocals. Each song features imaginative instrumentation and ideas.  Opeth uses a characteristic \\"voice\\" in some of the weightier sections, and it's more like a character in the music, rather than just some heavy posturing.  All round, atmospheric, nice dual guitars, epic concepts and sweep - a great outing!
0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for a Christmas gift for my husband and dear girlfriend of mine who undoubtedly are the biggest fans of Star Wars that I know.  You should've heard their excitment the night I had them \\"race\\" (each other) to open their gifts. They were so totally blown away (and basically speechless) that I don't know if I even got a \\"Thank you\\". That's okay.  I know I gave a gift this year that was OUT OF THIS WORLD for the both of them.  ~Bev S.
B000B8QG0O|4.0|My 5  year old son loves this movie.  He has a lot of fun pretending to be Buzz Lightyear and going after Zurg.  It's a great \\"good, clean, fun\\" movie.  I highly recommend it.
0740748475|3.0|We purchased this collection for my nine year old son who loves all things Calvin and Hobbes.  He already owns every paperback collection of comics, but this seemed too nice to pass up.    After a few days of non-stop reading the books cover to cover, we saw that the binding of the books was coming loose from the spine.  The glue used to bind the collection seems very weak, and was not able to hold up against the love of a young boy.  A few squirts of shop glue into the spine and it is stronger than ever now, but I feel for the price we paid for the collection it should have been bound better than just a little weak glue.    The quality of the printing is wonderful and having everything dated on each page is very nice.  Just be ready for these books to fall apart on you if you plan to read them often.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Ok, I know Bruce isn't getting any younger, but he will forever be sexy in my mind.  I'm a huge fan of Die Hard and this movie did NOT dissapoint.  I loved all the action and the story behind it.  I was happy to find that the movie was less about his character's life and more about non-stop action and story-plot.  A good watch!
0394806220|5.0|My five year son really enjoyed this book.Our whole family loves any of the Dr. Seuss books and they are always the first ones picked to read.My son has begun to read by himself after receiving the book.
B000031EGV|5.0|I haven't watched this movie in a long while and came across it when I was looking for stocking stuffers.  My Husband, myself, and two kids popped some pop corn and all of us were laughing out loud the whole movie.  I forgot how funny it was.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|After watching the entire film, I liked the overall theme - one man's aimless journey through life after a soul shattering experience.  Scene after scene of roadside travelogue with breaks of awkward interaction with people all makes sense in the last scene of the film.  A heck of a last scene it is too.  Yes, it has a graphic oral sex scene but it's really sad when you realize what haunts Bud (Vincent Gallo).  We discover that Bud's obsession with his old girlfriend carries deep emotional scars.  Apparently, she was an addict and not even being pregnant could curb her habit.  Bud's anger over this leads to an even more troubling event.  We see exactly what haunts Bud as he relives the moment when he's revisited by his old flame.  This version was heavily edited by Gallo from the original 102 minutes film festival version that caused such a sensation.  I gather the film was improved by this cutting and perhaps more editing would have made an even better film.  I get it, Bud did nothing when action was needed and now he prefers to squander the rest of his life without anything happening.  Or, he is so wounded that he cannot move past it and that makes for a very poignant moment.  But this brief flash of brilliance does not make up for the vastly dull and numbing travelogue provided beforehand.  Except for his random make-out sessions with lonely women (which is heartbreaking as he attempts to reconnect), everything else is mundane.  What's up with those drawn out close-ups of the back of Bud's head, or frames of just his ear, or countless other mind numbing moments?  I couldn't get past the one hour plus of slow motion that ends in a dizzying collage of \\"the incident\\".  I would recommend this movie only to true avant-garde film lovers who appreciate one artist's attempt to make an original film.
B000002572|5.0|How good do you have to get to consider an album to be essential? I'm not sure but I know what I like & as good as this album is, for some reason, I don't come back to it. I listen to it & I go: Man, what an album; there's not a bad thing on it! And yet.... it may be a month before I listen to it again.    As far as arena rock goes it doesn't get much better than this. These songs were ready  to go live the minute they were created. Tom  Scholz is a genius, more ways than one, Brad Delp an incredible singer. I imagine the rest of the group doesn't matter that much because all the rest of the original lineup has come & gone.    Boston is a very good album & an incredible debut. So..., why don't I listen to it more often?
0761145613|5.0|The 2006-07 edition kept my busy family on track to it was a no brainer to purchase this year's edition.
B0000025C0|4.0|Just like Boston's eponymous debut, I find myself not playing this album very often. Granted, it's not quite as good as the debut album but it's still very good, nonetheless. When I listen to this album I'm very impressed but I don't return to it very often. Is it possible because it's overly produced... might be. There's no doubt the production is good & extremely polished & therein may lie the problem; it's too polished. When I put this CD in the player it sounds great but, somehow, there seems to be a certain energy (rawness?) that's lacking. Could just be me, doc, I know.
0307387178|5.0|a well written account of what could have been a coming of age tale. it's a great story and jon krakauer is a master author. due to the authors objective style everyone who reads this book will come away with something different.

B000003BDJ|5.0|The Rolling Stones fall into a category similar to the Beatles and Beach Boys in that they have had so many hits and songs that they will never have a good greatest hits album because of the large number of songs they recorded. This includes most of the hits for the 1964-1971 hits of the Stones. If you are a huge Stones fan, you'll need another album in addition to this one to have complete \\"SATISFACTION\\" to have a more complete collection of the Stones hits. Every song on this album is a \\"Hot Rock\\" and the album is worth every penny especially for those who like only the Stones' songs from the 1960s and very early 70s.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I don't think this show needs any more piling on; it's spectacular.  If you haven't seen it, see it.  As for this boxed set, I haven't looked at seasons 5-7, but the other disks are all just repackaged versions of those found in the original single season sets, with all of the same special features, menus, etc.  I've found the case itself to be a little ill-conceived: the tabs for each season get bent if you turn the box over, cardboard disk slots aren't the best way of holding DVDs, It's physically large and heavy, the booklet is large and a little difficult to fish out from the top of the box.  The inclusion of the script from the pilot is a nice, if unsubstantial addition.  Bottom line, it's a cheap way of getting all of the DVDs.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|I owned the originals on regular DVD - excellent movies (all three) - so I upgraded to HD DVD...now even better.
B000ZN8036|3.0|Their were things I liked about the movie, and things I didn't like.  Let's start with what I did like: Good outdoor scenery, great photography, decent acting (not oscar-worthy, but decent).   But I didn't like how the move made him out to be some sort of hero.  What he did wasn't impressive, it takes no skill, and isn't all that interesting of a story:  He hitchhiked across America to Alaska, tried to live off the land but died because he is neither prepared or knowledgeable enough of the outdoors.  Are we supposed to look up to this guy??? I also didn't like how it portrayed him as both confused and hurting, but conversely as also a deep-thinking, philosophical, enlightning person.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|This movie is a MUST HAVE in HD DVD if you have a larger screen.  Some movies are OK on regular DVD...this is one that should be viewed on HD.
0807262013|5.0|TOO COOL!!!
B000G759LW|4.0|I was not surprised at all, except some lyrical songs. Powerful voice, that's for sure.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I watched the movie, Serenity, first.  I was intrigued.  Then, I went back and watched Season 1 of Firefly.  Then I watched it again.  And again.  Then I came back to the movie just as this worthy special edition was released.      Do it backwards, or forwards, or inside out.  It doesn't matter.  If you have an appreciation for good storytelling, you'll be truly hooked on both the television show and the film.  The series is like a huge 'origins' easter egg that supports the film.  The crazy thing is that this statement is also true the other way around.  Nearly every intricate plot point of interest in the series is paid off in the movie in big ways...but you don't have to watch the series to dig the movie.  If you're a writer, try to get your aspiring noodle around THAT one.    Serenity is a stupendous film full of characters with real conflict, real human value.   This film is an amazing balancing act in plot, humor, and daring tragedy.       Pick up this flick.  It's worth it many times over.    New frontiers.  Freedom.  Brotherhood. An orange wool hat.    What more do you want?
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I love this cd. its my favorite cd. definitely worth getting. i am so glad i got it.
B000007MVD|5.0|Excellent addition to my Beatles collection. I would recommend it to anyone, whether a Beatles fan or not. Good variety of music. Shows the versatility of the Beatles and their music.
0440238153|1.0|Wow, what happened?  After a great start with The Golden Compass,and The Subtle Knife, the trilogy collapses With The Amber Spyglass.  I found the book to lack the pacing and feel of the other books in this series.  Any chapter that had Mary Malone and the mulefa in it was extremely boring and uninteresting.  Every time there's a difficult point in the plot, Mr. Pullman has a character from the past magically appear and solve the problem. The final chapter of this trilogy was disjointed and flat.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this series.
0553382179|4.0|This was a funny and book. The ladies were able to relate to me as a mom. There were helpful suggestions. Some of them were outdated due to technology, but the basis concepts were timeless.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Merchandise was in excellent condition. Arrived before expected time. Very good service. Will do return business with this seller.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This was the best season IMHO of \\"Lost\\" and made me wanting more.  The title of my review is a quote from \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" but in this case refers to the long gosh darn time I've had to wait for \\"Lost's\\" return.  Most shows would have lost me due to aggravation half way through this waiting period.  But \\"Lost\\" is so good and the season ending so great that I am still eagerly anticipating January 31st.      The DVD set has some really nice features including commentary that tells you things you really want to know, and featurettes with really nice background pieces on all the crew not just the stars.  The interface on the last DVD is a little aggravating since you can't seem to activate parts of it.  Perhaps there are \\"Easter Eggs\\" there but I'm not smart enough to get into them. Overall the DVD Set was worth every penny to me and got me excited again about season 4.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Bought this one for the grandchildren, my daughter and son-in-law watched it more than the littles ones.
1400063515|3.0|I just finished this book after picking at it over a three-month period.  It's not the easiest book to read.  The author's style is a bit rambling.  I've read many books on numbers, predictions, behavioral finance, etc.  Taleb certainly added to my knowledge.  I'm sure he's a very smart guy, and I felt smarter after reading his book.  And, I'm much more aware of Black Swans and the unpredictability of some events.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Excellent story, the scenes seemed to jump with action more than the first two.  Makes you want to find out more about him and Nicky.  Would also like to find out what made him sign-up for that program.  I have purchased all the books and have begun reading.  I also purchased the Bourne Identity miniseries DVD with Richard Chameberlin & Jacquelyn Smith, these special effects are not in this one :-)  The story follows the book more though.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is a must have CD if you even think you might like Michael Buble.  While the music is still in the same gendre, it offers a new variety of songs for Michael to master.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|My wife got me hooked on Lost but, I really started to enjoy it the third season.  Now that they have kind of eluded to what the Dharma initiative is and I know where that polar bear came from it is starting to be much more fun for me.  If your a fan of some science fiction and really good interwoven stories then buy the third season, it is the best so far.
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|It got here within the designated time. I really enjoyed watching it. I love this movie!
B000RW3YYA|5.0|This box set is a must have for any Atlantis fan. Aside from getting complete episodes, the commentaries are also good to hear and quite informative. Anything a die-hard fan wants to know about the making of the series, or just watching how the actors joked around on the set are so much fun. I have owned the previous seasons of Atlantis but I think the third season's extra features are the most satisfying.
0143038419|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  Gave some interesting information about the countries visited,including the people, food and cultures.  It's easy to identify with her pursuit of spirituality and love. She has a great writing style that's easy to read and which keeps one's interest. I would recommend this book to any woman.
0500512159|5.0|Bought this for my boyfriend (who is a sneakerhead) and he loves it. High quality print, bright pages, covers many of the classic brands and at an excellent price - best price I've seen for this book and I've looked for it elsewhere. Definetly recommended.
B00008977N|5.0|A friend of my husband's recommended this DVD, so I bought it for Christmas. What a wonderful choice! We thoroughly enjoyed it. Peter Gabriel puts on an outstanding show. I purchase the CD along with the DVD and have been listening to it over and over.
0385335997|5.0|I've read all of Diana Gabaldon's books at least three times. They're so rich with detail and so well developed you can get lost in her books. One thing I like is that even though it's listed as romance, it isn't smut, there's a whole story behind it and it isn't just about the characters' romantic relationships.
B00125JP1C|4.0|This movie is not to be taken so seriously.  Lets put it this way the main character is eating a carrot all the way through the movie like Bugs Bunny.  This is more of a cartoon live action performance than anything else.  And if you can keep that in mind its a fun romp of a movie.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Great game for both kids and adults.  My five year old son enjoys playing as do both of us parents.  I would say that it's better suited for 4 players than 2 or 3, but it still is lots of fun for 2 players.
0143038419|5.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\"  Elizabeth took a chance and wrote about her journey on finding herself.  She was able to find a bit of herself in each of the three countries she visited.  First was Italy, and what better way to get over your divorce and breakups than going to Italy? You have the best food, beautiful language, and friends around you constantly.  Second was India, where she really found who she is and found her inner self by praying and doing yoga.  Third was Indonesia, where she found real piece and an unexpected true love.
0439882826|5.0|Bought this for my 7 year old son who is a BIG star wars fan. This is a beautiful book - very impressive.  Even his doctor commented on it when he had brought it to a recent visit.  And of course, you can't beat Amazon's prices.
0151013837|5.0|A riveting tale of a boy's fight for survival when stranded at sea with minimum supplies and a Tiger for company. A well written, emotional story that never lets up.  This hard cover edition is beautifully illustrated and adds to the overall experience.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This is my 16 month old daughter's first doll and we all love it very much.  She has a 5 month old little sister and watches every move mommy makes and was really ready to care for her own baby.  This doll is just the right size for her to do just that.  She feeds her, puts her in the swing, diapers her and burps her.  She is completely fascinated with the eyelashes, too.  I am so glad we picked this soft, sweet smelling baby.
B00004R99F|4.0|This was a great movie!  Better than I remembered it to be.  Good choice!
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|If your a fan of the Bourne series be sure to check this one out.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|If anyone likes the TV series Lost as my wife and I do, then you need to get this DVD.  We missed a few episodes last season due to extenuating circumstances.  Now we were able to view them at our leisure and even re-run certain portions of the program to make sure we didn't miss important clues.  It's so easy to miss what may be a clue to help you understand what is going on.  We have seen things that helped us immensely.  We are now prepared for the coming 4th season of 'Lost'.
1430300612|5.0|Not only is this book an awe-inspiring story of a woman's complete recovery from a devastating stroke, but I learned more brain anatomy and function than I did in nursing school. A must read.
B000QQH4YS|3.0|I actually returned this one because it wasn't the on in the collector's tin, but the movie is still the same so I still gave it 3 stars.
1592402038|5.0|Hilarious book I bought for my stepmother who is a punctuation stickler. I didn't get to read the whole thing before I gave it to her, but I couldn't put it down. She loved it so much, she can't stop raving about it.
B000002GQJ|5.0|I have always liked the Moody Blues, one of the bands that every song is good. This purchase was to replace older albums, tapes and worn out CD's witch were worn out from use.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|One of the most amazing and beautifully told stories any child could wish to see.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|Considering the Resident Evil movie universe, this third entry into the series is probably on par with the first movie, if not better.  I know many people aren't fans of this series, but I do get a kick out of them.  I thought the second one was a bit of a disappointment, but the series came back with Extinction.  Alice is back, along with a couple of characters from Apocalypse.  Humanity is on the brink of extinction now as the virus continues to grow and grow.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is not exactly a unique take, but where else would they go with it?  If you like the Resident Evil movies, definitely check this one out.  If you didn't like the first one, you should probably steer clear.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Love this Muppets movie! Has Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge and Kermit as Bob Crochet.  So classy, well done, and has a great story with in the story. Pretty funny when they mean to be. A little scary when the story calls for it. Integrity to the classic story.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Worth every penny. The high-definition DVD looks great; the closeups of the unusual instruments used are interesting; the dynamism of the musicians surrounding our Muse lifted and inspired me. We danced and sang; replayed it and danced and sang again.
B00003CX9W|4.0|Fantasia has always been a favorite movie of mine and it still is.  The quality of the artwork is not up to today's crisp standards, but it is true to the original.  I was worried when I saw reviews that Disney had cut up the Pastoral piece, but it was okay.  I didn't even notice it.  The part I did notice is that Disney included the extended parts where the narrator speaks. While he does go on and tell you the whole story about the next piece, you can pick up your remote and skip it.<br />Overall very good job.  Overall really pricey too.
0805079831|5.0|Buy it. Read it. Gift it. We all need to start doing something to correct the route our country is on - just showing up & voting on election day isn't enough. Education is the first step, wake up America!!
0307237702|5.0|This book is really wonderful, and it is worth reading regardless of which party you belong to.  Barack Obama's practical, common sense approach to politics is exactly what we need to avoid the partisan bickering and ideological stare-downs that have made our government so ineffective in the past.  I highly recommend this book.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|So much enjoyed owning this movie for this holiday season and sharing it with family and a friend who had never seen it before.
B000W07EKW|5.0|We are Bourne fans and this is a great way to get all 3 movies!  We are very happy with the set.
031286504X|4.0|I read I Am Legend after seeing the movie and was interested in reading the book.  I was unprepared for what I read.<br />The first 160 pages or so were what I expected - an interesting, capturing story which was undoubtedly imaginative and well written.  What people fail to stress and/or mention of this book is that the story about Robert Neville comprises only half of the novel!<br />The other half was filled with horror stories that were frightening and disturbing.  I was unable to sleep at night and had nightmares from the images I conjured from reading them.<br /><br />Does that mean these short stores were well-written? I'm not sure.  I absolutely can't believe that after reading such an amazing first story, I was bombarded with extremely frightening and NOT fun to read stories which led me to believe Matheson had to be a very disturbed man (besides the point, I suppose).  I would just like to prepare readers for what they may read after the first half of the book!<br /><br />I was creeped out and could only finish the book because I hate leaving books half-read.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this production on PBS. As I was poking around on Amazon to see what others thought, I noticed a few negative reviews. These negative reviews, it seems to me, can be grouped generally under one heading: So-and-so in the movie wasn't true to so-and-so in the book.    So this weekend, after seeing the production for the second time, I reread the book (I had read it in high school, but not at the level of attention it deserved). So as I read, I kept in mind the question: Is this movie version true to the book? So here are my observations:    First, Wilson and Stephens do, generally speaking, seem to match the physical descriptions of Jane and Rochester. Rochester, if memory serves, is most often described as broad-chested, with a large forehead, and stern mouth (among other things). It seemed to me that Toby Stephens fit this description within reason. Ruth Wilson also seemed to fit well as Jane. So when I was reading the book, I never had a red flag go up--in other words, at no time reading the book did I feel as though either Toby Stephens or Ruth Wilson made a counterfeit Rochester or Jane.    Some reviewers said that Stephens wasn't brooding enough. However, if you read the book, especially during Jane's first few months at Thornfield, you find Rochester to be moody, yet never missing an opportunity to keep Jane off balance, playing devil's advocate with her, and generally enjoying a good verbal sparring match that includes, yes, a spirit of playfulness. And so in this respect, I thought that Stephens captured this element of Rochester's character with great skill. You could really see that although Rochester's sprits are lifted by Jane's presence, he soon remembers the chains that bind him. So to me, Stephens successfully captured the complexity and depth of Rochester's character.    Other reviewers complained about the dialogue being dumbed down. However, as I read the book, it struck me that in some very important scenes (e.g. when Eliza gives Georgiana a verbal clobbering) the dialogue seems to match the text of the book almost verbatim.    Still others complained of Jane's relationship with God as not being prominent enough in this production. As I read the book, I noticed references to God more toward the end (more after her encounter with St. John). At the end of the book, Jane's thoughts dwell more on the spiritual, but it seemed to me that for most of the book, allusions to Providence and such were present, but not exactly what I would describe as being in the forefront.    So I loved this production. The only improvement I would have asked for is this: that the events from after the failed wedding to Jane's travels to Moor House should have perhaps been rendered in chronological order. That having been said however, I must admit that having the post-wedding scenes between Rochester and Jane as flashbacks made for some quite powerful viewing. Also, this struck me as being true to the book because in the book Jane is constantly thinking of Rochester while at Moor House. In a text format, as author Bronte could say that Jane is thinking of Rochester while other action is taking place, but how do you depict that on screen? So after thinking about it a little, I began to see the wisdom in doing things that way because it kept the movie from straying too far from home while showing Jane's continued devotion to Rochester. A nice way to adapt that part of the story to the visual medium--although I didn't like it at first.    The areas in which I did notice the production deviating from the book was in the locations of things. For instance, in the book, when Jane hears Rochester calling her, she's in the drawing room with St. John, but in the movie she's outside. Also, in the book when she finds out about what happened to Rochester, she's at an inn, but in the movie, Jane is outside in a field adjacent to Thornfield Hall. So there were a few differences there.    Bronte's writing is so rich and loaded with emotion. Consider for a moment the depth of the writing when Bronte describes Jane's inner struggles (e.g. when she is on her way out of Thornfied Hall after the failed wedding). The folks who make movies have to figure out ways to bring this to life in a visual medium. That's a challenge, to say the least. The person writing the screenplay, I suppose, has to deal with that more than anybody. So to me, this production was really well done. They did a wonderful job of bringing this story to life from a literary format (text) to a visual format.    Addendum:    Some folks have complained that Jane would not have kissed Rochester after the failed wedding. So I went back and looked at the book again, and it's true--in the book, Jane resists Rochester's physical affections on moral grounds, noting that he is, after all, married. So in the movie, when Jane is at Moor House and has the flashbacks to the scenes from after the failed wedding (where there is much smooching), I agree that those scenes aren't exactly true to the book.    After watching many clips of the other movie versions of Jane Eyre, I must say that no other version comes close to this one as far as the expressiveness of the actors. The acting in this movie is of the highest caliber. Wilson, for instance, has been nominated for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe, and deservedly so.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I also got this for Christmas, and I was sooo excited to see it when I opened it. I've been watching the show every week, but now I own season one of the Tudors and it's fabulous!!!! For anyone who loves history, buy this!!!! It's definately NOT old stuffy history, it's luxuriously sexy, but all the history is in there.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This fine series is another example of how little television program directors know about what appeals to science fiction fans.  Constant day/time slot switches killed Firefly before it had the chance to develop the kind of following similar series' developed with reliable days and time slots.      I am a fan of science fiction as are many of my friends.  We all enjoyed what we could see when the series was on TV but most were not able to see all of the episodes due to the crazy scheduling.  I imagine most individuals who became fans did so despite the best efforts of the \\"suits\\" to kill the project, ...due to cost I would imagine.    The movie that resulted from the outcry of those few but vocal fans does a good job of bringing the character's stories together and resolving most of the questions, as well as leaving a potential for another movie or additional episodes.  Most of the players have moved on to other venues and have further demonstrated skills at their craft.    I enjoyed the series and really enjoyed the movie that follows: Serenity.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This movie is full of David Lynchisms..dwarfs, dream sequences, kinky sex.  For those not into Lynchisms, it is worth it just for the performance of Naomi Watts... Without revealing the plot, she has a number of personality changes.  She is convincing and powerful in every mode.  Very sexy too.
6305263248|5.0|Robert DeNero plays an American intelligence operative in this very \\"real world\\" screenplay about mercenaries hired to obtain a \\"thing\\" for an un-named client.      This screenplay pretty accurately portrays what people who live that kind of life experience with long periods of tedium punctuated by intense moments of action, ...when training and knowledge take over allowing one to survive or not.    Superior movie overall.
B000SQFC0E|4.0|I remembered liking this movie, but it turns out not so much. But the HD-DVD is great!!!

B00011F5DK|5.0|I bought this for our 4 year old because of the educational value.  But my husband & I love playing it too.  There's a lot of strategy that goes into playing this game so it's very hard for our son to win, and he gets frustrated.  But I think in time he will learn the strategy part so it will be challenging for all of us.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I first should say I own a Nikon D50 with an SB-600 flash. The SB-600 is a bit large and unwieldy, so I was happy to hear about the SB-400. I was heading out on a trip to Europe, so I bought one figuring its small size would work better in a crowded tourist environment than the rather bulky SB-600.<br />  The SB-400 worked well, but recycle time was a problem. Within half a dozen shots, I started to experience 10-second recycle time. I could work around that, but I don't like to. I switched back to the SB-600 and had no further problems.<br />  The SB-400 has two batteries, while the SB-600 has four. I'd guess that's the reason.
B000BGH22W|5.0|This is a great collection of the songs from the fourth Harry Potter movie for anyone who appreciates them while watching the movie.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|Well if you haven't already seen the movie then definitely watch it if you played the Play Station game.  If you already have, this box set has some pretty nifty extras.  The script isn't really too interesting, but the post cards can be nice collectibles.  Looks great on the shelf.
B000QXDE6I|5.0|The remastered Cd is awesome. I've been searching for this one on CD for a long time. I never could find it on CD. It's a must have if you love Steve Vai.
B000AE8FN0|5.0|Absolutely amazing CD.An item to buy.<br />I also recommend Melanie C: Live Hits DVD
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I originally watched the first two disc on a 14-inch tube tv--no HD, no flat screen, no surround sound--and even on the most basic technology, this series is amazing.  I know some people prefer the Sigourny Weaver (sic) version over David Attenborough's because ... I'm not sure why? I've never felt like I was watching a stodgy science class documentary; the footage is so crisp, so amazing, so unreal that you can't be bored. Seriously.  Amazon was great on shipping two copies of these before Christmas Eve and I  haven't had any problems with the discs.   I really can't tell you how amazing this series is. Just buy it.
0393327655|4.0|I bought this at the airport on a whim and read it before I returned home. Most of the book is an intelligent argument about the dangers of faith, how it can lead people to do unspeakable things. For example, if you have total faith that if you blow yourself up killing infidels you and your entire family will go to heaven, then to do so would be completely rational. Obviously, Islam isn't the only religion subject to this critique. The end of the book gets a little mystical for me though. While the author is still grounded (sort of) in science, he just goes on and on about a few twinkle ding dong ideas that end up as a boring digression.
1400063515|5.0|This is one of those books where saying \\"it's about how highly improbably events shape the world\\" isn't going to do justice to the how much detail it goes into. His basic premise though, is that those black swans, events that are unpredictable and large in scale (think, the internet of the savings and loan collapse in the 80s) are what drive all the change in the world. I'm not really sure how to go into more without writing 8 pages, but it's full of ideas you likely haven't ever deeply considered and for that reason highly recommended. Taleb strikes me as someone who's probably pretty annoying to hang out with though and times it seems like he looks down his nose at everyone.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Lots of chases, lots of excitment. I recommend all 3 movies of the series.
0618680004|4.0|This book was a two-face. Some of the chapters were well constructed, interesting, and persuasive. One such chapter was the one about Einstein's religion and how when some scientists use the word `god' they mean something entirely different from the personal god of the bible.  Another good portion discussed the changing moral zeitgeist (Basically, Lincoln's views on race seem backwards in the context of our society) and how, wherever else we get morality from, we don't get it from the bible. His `ultimate 747' argument is also well conceived and presented but it's not immune to the usual fundamentalist retort: you can't impose your scientific epistemology on god. He also has some weak points. Specifically he almost pokes fun of the religious for bringing up examples of `bad' atheists (like Stalin), as if that had any effect on what's actually true, but then does it for an insufferably long time himself. This book is definitely recommended, I'd just skip the section where he reads hate mail he's received from Christians.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This is a great DVD filled with wonderful bonuses! It's also sold at a great price! You have access behind the scenes and it just makes me wonder why I never attened the concert myself! This is a must-have for any Celine fan! Celine is a true artist and her personality shines throughout the DVD. She is just an icon that everyone should look up to. She is wonderful, and they made a superb dvd. The songs are wonderful, she sings her best hits! This gets a triple A plus from me!
B000VBJEFK|4.0|Once you get over the fact that rats have taken over the kitchen, this is a highly enjoyable and splendidly written movie. It might be going to far to compare this movie to a good meal, but the analogy works: lots of familiar ingredients, a few unexpected suprises, and overall the viewer is left completely satisfied. Just the right amount of sweetness in the dessert. Odds are good that you will like this movie.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I order this DVD for my child because I knew that I enjoyed watching when I was a kid myself. Its a good family film
B000VR824S|5.0|I am amazed at the number of reviews here that do not mention how poorly directed this DVD is. Far too many edits and close ups of the back of the drummers head during a guitar solo. What was the director thinking? People are going to want to see the GUITARISTS AT A GUITAR CONCERT! When the singer sings, show the singer. When the drummer adds a fill, show the drummer. When the guitarist plays a SOLO show the GUITARIST! NOT THE BASS PLAYER TALKING TO A STAGE HAND, NOT THE DRUMMER TAKING A DRINK OF WATER, AND NOT SOMEONE YAWNING IN THE AUDIENCE!  The sound is fine, but not particularly noteworthy. The mixing is OK except for a couple of spots. There were very few technical problems (although, in response to many of the reviewers who lamented the omission of Beck's \\"A Day in the Life\\", it was probably left on the cutting room floor because of a couple of serious audio malfunctions with the recording equipment).  SO HERES THE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THIS DVD: ITS FINE TO LISTEN TO, BUT VERY ANNOYING TO WATCH.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I was insanely crazy about \\"90210.\\" This was my all-time favorite show as a tween. Because \\"90210\\" really was the very first American TV show that actually spoke to kids and had real issues that everyone could relate to. During the first season we got to meet the entire gang...      Most of the eps either revolved around Brandon (Jason Priestely,) or someone else in the Walsh House. Didn't it almost seem like Brandon had a new girl every other week? Cindy (Carol Potter) and Jim Walsh (James Eckhouse) were such cool parents. I often wished that my parents were as understanding as they were, especially Mrs. Walsh. (I suppose that's what TV writers do best; make the parents look perfect?) As a kid, my favorite character was always Brenda Walsh (played by none other than the original Britney Spears ~ Shannen Doherty.) Brenda was always so forthright and honest about her feelings. Some fans have even said that Brenda was \\"mean.\\" I tend to disagree. I think she was just a girl who knew exactly what she wanted and wasn't afraid to say it. But as an adult, watching this set, I have an entirely new fondness for Brandon. He was such a kind-hearted young man, and always so willing to go out of his way for others and help any way he could. Brandon was a total mensch. And wasn't he so cute, too? I loved when he smiled because he had the most adorable dimples.      Throughout the very beginning of season 1, Kelly Taylor (Jenny Garth) and Donna Martin (Tori Spelling, of course) were portrayed as brain-dead snobs. Donna, especially, came off as such a superficial air-head. But after you scratched the surface a little and got to know them you saw a couple of very sweet girls who were really no different from any other American teenagers.      I always enjoyed Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) and Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering.) Dylan was the quiet loner who was often the voice of reason. He's a lot like [[ASIN:B000H7JCGE Jake Hanson ]]. Like Donna and Kelly, at first Steve came off as very superficial and incredibly spoiled. But once I got to know him I saw a very sensitive young man. I love the ep during season 1, when Steve's Corvette was stolen by those 2 girls and he starts crying and Brandon tries to make him feel better.       Rounding out the cast were the 3 egg-heads, Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris,) David Silver (Brian Green, FKA Brian Austin Green) and the rarely-seen Scott Scanlon (Douglas Emerson.) Out of these 3, Andrea was the only one who was welcomed into the gang during season 1. I was never crazy about her though because she always seemed so needy and a touch on the greedy side. Andrea had somewhat of a chip on her shoulder because she was poor and the rest of the kids weren't. Over the years, David did get cool, but in season 1 he was just a lowly freshman that no one else wanted to hang around with. Except for his bff, Scott.     Here's all the eps from season one:      Class of Beverly Hills   The Walsh's get used to life in Beverly Hills. In syndication, this ep airs in 2 parts. Note: the original title of the series was \\"Class Beverly Hills.\\"      The Green Room   Brandon meets a new girl at the beach. Note: this is the first ep with Dylan.      Every Dream Has Its Price (Tag)   Brenda doesn't feel like one of the girls while shopping with them.      The First Time   Sheryl, Brandon's girlfriend comes for a visit and stays overnight with him. See what I mean about having cool parents?      One on One   Brandon and Andrea think there is a conspiracy among school officials when they see a student who doesn't appear to be a resident of Beverly Hills.      Higher Education   Brandon's American History teacher grades the class by an unreasonable curve.      Perfect Mom   Brenda really likes Kelly's mom, Jackie (Ann Gillespie.) But she thinks differently of her when it's revealed that Jackie's just a negligent addict.      The 17-Year Itch   Mr. and Mrs. Walsh celebrate their 17th wedding anniversary.      The Gentle Art of Listening   Brenda and Andrea volunteer at a teen crisis hotline. The girls both try to help a student when it is revealed that she is getting r-a-p-e-d by some of the football team.      Isn't It Romantic?   Brenda catches Dylan taking a shower in her bathroom. Did I say how cool Jim and Cindy are?      B.Y.O.B.   Brandon and Brenda have a party when their parents are away and poor Brandon gets arrested for drunk driving.      One Man and a Baby   Brandon befriends Melissa, a senior with a baby boy who has dreams of going to college.      Slumber Party   This is one of my very favorite eps! The girls have a slumber party. Kelly brings along this total b itch, Amanda (Michele Abrams.) I love it when Bren says to her, \\"you've been acting like a total b itch since you got here.\\" David and Scott swing by the Walsh home to spy on the girls. Steve and Brandon have a hot evening with a couple of chicks; that is, until Steve's Vette is stolen.      East Side Story   Jim and Cindy allow their maid's friend, Carla to use their address so she can attend West Beverly. But there is more to the story than meets the eye. And Brandon (the little detective that he always was, in season 1,) sets out to find out the truth about Carla.      A Fling in Palm Springs   Everyone except for Brandon and Andrea goes to Palm Springs. Dylan and Brenda get in a big fight.      Fame Is Where You Find It   Brandon gets a part on a popular TV show. He even starts dating the star of the show, Lydia Leeds (Marcy Kaplan.)      Stand (Up) and Deliver   This is another favorite of mine. Brandon decides to run for class president with Andrea as his campaign advisor. Things get out of hand when Kelly Taylor takes over. Meanwhile, Bren housesits for an older friend and learns that being on her own may not be all it's cracked up to be.      It's Only a Test   The gang takes their S.A.T.'s. Brenda finds a lump in her chest.      April Is the Cruelest Month   Brandon interviews Roger (Matthew Perry,) an all-star student, for the school paper and learns some troubling details about him.      Spring Training   This is another favorite of mine because it shows how sweet Bran was. He coaches a Beverly Hills peewee baseball team and learns how competitive and stuck-up some of the parents can be.      Spring Dance   The gang all go to \\"The Spring Fling\\" and Kelly becomes \\"Spring Princess.\\" Meanwhile, Bren and Dylan slip off to a hotel room.      Home Again   The Walsh's may have to go back to MN because Jim is faced with a transfer. Andrea decides to sleep with Brandon as a going away gift. Everything seems to be back to normal when Jim decides not to move back. But at their party at The Pit, Bren reveals to Dylan that she missed her period!      \\"90210\\" was on for 10 years, and like many fans, I stopped watching way before that. Unfortunately, after Shannen Doherty left the series it was nowhere near as entertaining. (It's almost like what happened to [[ASIN:B0000DFZ5O Three's Company ]]after Suzanne Somers was fired.) Because it just wasn't the same without Brenda. Should they have kept Shannen? Many of the cast members have stated that she was incredibly difficult to work with. Shannen was also famous for starting viscous cat-fights with the other girls on the show. She absolutely despised Gabrielle Carteris with a passion and would verbally berate her any chance she got. I think it was Ian Ziering who went on Arsenio (right around the time she was fired) and had a few choice words to say about her. The show still went on for 6 seasons without Shannen (I think I stopped watching by end of season 6/beginning of season 7) but it was never the same. And, none of the seasons were as captivating or groundbreaking as season 1 always was!      Why is Shannen Doherty such a compelling and provocative superstar...?      More than fifteen years before Paris, Britney and trampy Lohan burst onto the Hollywood scene, Shannen was already a household name. Shannen became one of the hardest working women in Tinseltown because of her strong work ethic and sheer determination to excel at everything she stamped her good name on.      Today, Shannen has arguably become one of the most famed American actresses. But, in the late '70's and early '80s she was just an unknown child actor. Shannen got her big break on [[ASIN:B0002WZS9Y Father Murphy]], playing Drusilla Shannon on Merlin Olsen's hit family-friendly series. A year later, Shannen again garnered critical-acclaim on another wholesome program; as Jenny Wilder in the modern-classic that is [[ASIN:B000AA4KQ0 Little House on the Prairie ]]. In fact, Michael Landon was so impressed with Shannen's acting and professional demeanor that he invited her to appear in the [[ASIN:B000GIXCFQ Little House TV movies ]]even after the series was canceled!     In 1985 Shannen stared in the cult-classic, [[ASIN:B00004Y6BY Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]. This was one of Shannen's first roles as a teen which also garnered her coast-to-coast exposure as a film actress. A couple of years later, Shannen was cast opposite two of the biggest teen stars (Christian Slater and Winona Ryder) of the '80s in one of the biggest teen movies of the '80s. Of course I'm talking about none other than [[ASIN:B000059PPG Heathers ]]!      In \\"Heathers\\" Shannen played Heather Duke, a stuck-up girl that was only interested in being as snobbish as possible. The same year that \\"Heathers\\" came out, Shannen also shot the pilot for a new TV series, originally titled [[ASIN:B0002235LC Class Beverly Hills ]]     A year later, Shannen's series was picked up and retooled. This time, the series was called [[ASIN:B000H7JCG4 90210 ]]. Shannen portrayed the star of the show, kind-hearted Brenda Walsh. Brenda was actually a lot like Shannen. She was sweet, beautiful and very intelligent. And, most of all, she (both Shannen and Brenda!) didn't take garbage from anyone!     Throughout four Seasons we all watched Shannen on \\"90210\\" as she grew up into a young woman. As anyone who was a child of the '90s knows, \\"90210\\" was a huge worldwide sensation. And this was all thanks to Shannen! After the first season of \\"90210\\" Shannen became a bona fide star!     Shannen also more than helped put the fledging Fox Network on the map. Prior to \\"90210,\\" this network was simply known as an obscure TV station that more than 60% of the country did not receive! Once Shannen made \\"90210\\" a hit, Fox executives rolled out a \\"90210\\" spin-off in the summer of '92; [[ASIN:B000H7JCGE Melrose Place ]]! And less than two years later, \\"90210\\" which begat \\"Melrose,\\" begat \\"Models!\\" Although, Shannen refused to appear in any eps on either of those shows.      In 1993 Shannen shocked everyone when she eloped at the last minute with Ashley Hamilton. Everyone was shocked, but mostly, the Material Girl was seething, when she complained to MTV about being pushed off the cover of People Magazine so that they can make room for Shannen Doherty! A week later, newlywed Shannen went on Saturday Night Live, which received some of the highest ratings, ever!     Unbeknownst to Shannen, in the Winter of '94 nude photos of Shannen for an Aids awareness-campaign were published in a men's magazine, without her approval. When a reporter asked Shannen what Mr. Spelling would say about this, Shannen simply said, \\"ask me if I care!\\"      Shannen also stared in the blockbuster thriller, aptly titled \\"Blindfold.\\" In this feature film, Shannen played sexy Madeleine Dalton in one of her most diverse and talked-about movie roles ever! This film also helped cement Shannen's role as a true actress with completely unique talent. Because the role she was cast in was the total opposite of Brenda Walsh!     In early '94 there was another controversy when E! News broke the story! Shannen was leaving \\"90210!\\" She specifically asked her producers to let her out of her contract. Shannen gave cryptic hints as to why she was leaving the series that she helped build.      Industry-insiders intimated that Shannen wanted out of the series for a two-fold reason. First, she couldn't relate to any of the other performers because most of them were all much older than her; by now, most of them were all in their twenties or thirties! And, Shannen also wanted to leave the series because, unlike the rest of the cast, she was an actual actress!      Never one to be typecast, Shannen portrayed the famed novalist, Margaret Mitchell, airing a few months after her lest ep of 90210 aired, in the Fall of '94. The movie, \\"A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story\\" became an instant hit! It was also around this time that Shannen yet again made headlines when she proclaimed that she was just a \\"misunderstood, sweet, Southern Baptist girl!\\"     The following year, Shannen stared in the major motion picture, \\"Mallrats,\\" opposite Ben Affleck. Shannen played Rene Mosier in this cult-classic comedy. And, Ben Affleck's character's name was a homage to Shannen!      Over the next few years, from '95 to '98, Shannen appeared in a variety of movies, such as: \\"Gone in the Night,\\" \\"Friends 'Til the End,\\" \\"Ticket\\" and \\"Nowhere.\\" These films all afforded Shannen some of the best reviews of her entire career! It was also around this time that Shannen caught the attention of a very unlikely individual.     Mr. Aaron Spelling invited Shannen to consider the role of Prue Halliwell in the then-untitled series. Of course by now, we all know this was the hugely successful drama, \\"Charmed.\\" The producers of this show lucked out when Shannen chose to sign on!     Unlike \\"90210,\\" \\"Charmed\\" was science fiction, which was a totally new genre for Shannen. But Shannen totally fell in love with her new role and in fact stayed with the series for three years! Shannen even purchased a portion of the show! In 2001 Shannen experienced deja vu when the MSM reported that she was quiting another hit Spelling-series. This time Shannen kept mum as to why she was leaving, only saying that it was time to leave!      The producers of \\"90210\\" tried their hardest to get Shannen to come back for the series finale, but Shannen was much too busy to even consider such a fruitless project. She did consider letting the producers use images of herself from prior clips in their retrospective show, but then decided against it when no one could come to terms. (FYI: That's why Shannen doesn't appear as Brenda Walsh in any of the clips that are shown in the \\"90210\\" retrospective, this ep aired prior to the series finale!)     After leaving \\"Charmed,\\" Shannen hosted the much-anticipated hidden camera series, \\"Scare Tactics.\\" It also goes without saying that Shannen also appeared in a variety of other first-rate movies, such as: \\"View of Terror,\\" \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay.\\"      In 2006 Shannen got her own series on the Oxygen Network, \\"Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty.\\" In this reality program, Shannen joined forces with people in relationship peril who wanted to have a little fun! In the summer of '06, Shannen appeared on Babs' \\"View\\" as a guest co-host. During the second segment (while interviewing Kristin Davis,) Elizabeth said to everyone, \\"this is such a surreal moment for someone my age, I'm sitting next to Brenda and Brooke!\\" EH, I can imagine just what you mean!!!     What's next for Shannen? She will be staring in the upcoming movie, \\"Defuct.\\" Look for this movie in March of this year! And, Shannen just wrapped \\"Kiss Me Deadly;\\" a suspense-drama that will be out later this year!      Hate her...? ...Love her? Or, do you just love to hate her? Whatever you feel about Shannen, you can't deny that for nearly thirty years she has been a pop-culture phenomenon! And, unlike today's panjandrums Shannen never went kooky and has true talent!

B000002UAX|4.0|Maybe not their best, most cohesive album, but it might be their most influencial. They flirt with many styles of music during their career, but this album showcases nearly every style of music that ever made an impression on them, more so than any of their other releases.     Not many bands ever have had the balls, clout, and talent to pull an album off like this, and back in the day, The Beatles had all three. The Beatles had so much credibility they could put out a double album of very divergent and experimental songs, and still keep their fanbase - people who didn't care for this album just accepted that the lads went exploring.     For some reason, I like the production. Yes, its a mess, but I like that the songs sound as if they were done in one or two takes - on a good system, some of these songs have such a 'you are there' quality, which is a welcomed break to their sometimes overly busy sound. This is also interesting since most of the songs were done track at a time, so few of them were performed with all four members in the studio, playing at the same time. Yet, some songs have such an organic sound to them.     No, I would'nt use this album to showcase The Beatles to someone who wasn't familiar with their albums per'se, but I think everyone who hasn't sit down with this album and given it a few spins, should.

B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Incredible collection of songs by a master singer and songwriter. Signature blues tinged vocals and she delves deeper into social consciousness and the ultimate responsibility that each os us has to one another and to our world.         Being a vocalist, I enjoy how Annie spotlights the singer in every track....her background vocals are sometimes more interesting than the lead! She is considered by many to be the world's best white soul singer. More importantly, she is an incredible human being.....this shines through her work. She also is an incredible live performer.....never out of tune or out of step. Most of your singers today can onlyt make albums, they can't really sing------sing she always does and gives it her all!      I love tracks 1---5 the best! I also love falling asleep to Fingernail Moon!    The only song that I was not totally enthralled with was SING... I do admire what the anthem was used for however. Though she has 26 other star studded singers on the track....we only really hear one sing solo....Madonna and she is backed up by Annie herself.      I never have to worry about not getting my moneys worth from a Lennox project.....I have them all.

0375842381|5.0|The \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Philip Pullman is absolutely enthralling. I read all three books, during my week-long Christmas break from work. I highly recomment these books to anyone interested in other similar books such as the Harry Potter series, The Chronicles of Narnia, etc. They are like chocolate cake for the imagination!
0446619078|4.0|I've only read a few Harry Bosch novels by Michael Connelly, I've enjoyed them all even though the ones I have read have been scattered and not read in the correct order. In, The Last Coyote, Harry's temper lands him in trouble with his boss and temporarily out of a job.  With all his free time, he begins investigating the murder of his mother some thirty years ago.<br /><br />Harry Bosch smokes and drinks too much and has a temper to beat the band, but he is still such a likable and honerable guy who believes in doing the right thing, even if that means he has to lie, cheat and steel.  I like that.<br /><br />The Last Coyote will definitely not be the last Harry Bosch novel that I add to my reading list.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I think it is very difficult to find someone that has seen this movie that has not enjoyed it immensely. I know when it came it out it was sort of a sleeper. Not too many people knew about it, but those that did knew it was a fine film. I really do recommend this to anyone that wants to have a fun time watching a movie.
B00125JP1C|2.0|I have to start by being fair in that this movie claims to be a shoot-em-up, and in that category it succeeds. However, in every other category it fails miserably. Don't get me wrong, it has it all...the disenchanted former special ops guy, the damsel in distress, the evil but smart bad-guy, the government/corporation conspiracy, etc.  Unfortunately, everything is poorly executed and quite frankly, the writers simply did not try that hard to make a believable plot, or characters you could care about. What's worse is that the movie's core concept is to be a sinfully over-done shoot-em-up, but it fails in that respect as well.  The gun-battles are a been-there, done-that (10 years ago) affair. Finally, the acting is only sub-par.  Clive own does a respectable job with a terrible script and character, while Monica Bellucci is in such a role that no acting could save (and her acting was on par with a B movie actor anyway.)  The only notable performance comes from the films villain, who only barely succeeds in garnering extra notice.<br /><br />As a fan of the above described type of movie, I was quite disappointed overall.  I expected an unabashed shooter, but got some complete mess.  I would recommend you spend your money on something else.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|When I first saw the shows on Discovery earlier last year, I was enthralled with how good they were. I ended up missing some and this created the perfect opportunity to watch the ones I missed. This mini series is one of the best. The amount of time and energy the BBC put into this show is mind boggling. Some of the best parts of the show is the 10 minute behind the scenes after each show. I know discovery trimmed that down to like 1 minute, but here you have 10 full minutes. They take one particular shot that was hard to shoot and tell you all the hard work that went into getting that shot. This series is a must for any nature fan.
0684865130|5.0|If you were a MASH fan you will clearly see this novel as wellspring.  The humor is Marxian ( Groucho not Karl ) and you will see that there is nothing new. I am 150 or so pages in and among the chestnuts tackled so far are military tours of duty, farm subsidies, unscrupulous doctors, mindless bureaucracy and Texans.    A particular sentence made me burst out laughing which is uncommon for me when reading, especially bearing in mind that I was 17 hours into a 20 hour journey from the UK back to the US.    This is a great piece of writing and while I can understand its not appealing to everybody, Heller is a great artist and thinker.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|Tom Hanks is wonderful in this animated movie about a boy who no longer believes in Santa Claus.

The graphics are outstanding, the characters are very imaginative and Tom Hanks does a stellar job potraying a variety of characters. This is an instant classic! Wonderful family movie.
B000VBP38C|5.0|Beautiful movie, great way to show off your HD-DVD system. And Keira is not too shabby either. ;-)
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I received the movie in a timely manner (it was a Christmas gift for my brother).  No problems.  Received exactly as offered.
B0007Y08IS|2.0|This movie is so puerile, so goofy and cheap that I urge you to just move along. There's nothing to see here, folks.    This movie stinks of a neutralizing political calculus designed to offend everyone by equally glib measure. Team America is a special force designed to take down terrorists wherever they are by mindlessly firing guns and rockets anywhere around them. The joke: Team American destroys the village to save the village. Savor the sweet creamy humor of that, because the joke lasts for the entire length of the film. There are a few other jokes, though. Puppets are horribly imprecise actors, especially when directed by people who loath puppetry. Also: Actors are puppets, to be lured to Pyong Yang under ridiculous auspices and employed to fight Team America without any reason. Ha Ha. Arabic is a gibberish language that sounds mostly like \\"hakalaka laka haka.\\"    It's not that the whole film is a waste. There are some funny musical numbers, namely \\"America, F*ck Yeah\\" -- a direct hit, especially when they play a down-tempo version of it in the second act when it looks like TA is done for. Also, Kim Jong Il's \\"I'm So Lonely\\" is pretty good.    My point is this: Team America could have been a very good one-minute Super Bowl commercial. Stretched out to full-length and full-price, it's just horrible. If you don't feel cheated at the end of this film, you may be a card-carrying moron.
B00005JPLW|5.0|This was simply a great movie.  I saw it on the big screen and was totally blown away.  When I saw it on DVD, I was equally moved.  The images, the emotion, the story, the artistic feel.  WOW!  Who cares that it is not 100% historically accurate, it made me want to study, and learn about the true story of the 300.  The special feature disc is great with all the behind the scenes footage, and the special interviews.<br /><br />You have to get this for your DVD library!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|i know what i was buying had seem it on dish and like it it is one of the movies you wanted too see again . men may not like it this is a girl movie . i also bougth them as gift for my teen grand daugther.

037571457X|5.0|So let me tell you about this amazing book called Persepolis. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss your ignorance of the Iranian Islamic revolution on a personal level goodbye.     Number one. I found it relatable, being born in the same year as the author. I was alive in America when jean jackets, Nikes, and Michael Jackson buttons were very cool to have, not to mention Iron Maiden posters. And what makes the story so personal is how very much like me she is, yet she grew up on the other side of the world and lived through the middle of a terrifying revolution.     The story is terrifying. Her and her family waiting for the Iraqi scud missiles to drop knowing there was no sense waiting in the basement because they would die if a scud hit their home.    It was funny. Early in the story the author's convinced she is a prophet and has numerous discussions with God. Then later when her uncle is killed God tries to talk to her again and she wants nothing to do with Him and tells him to go away.    The emotions of the characters are so endearing, young girls wearing their veils with varying degrees of confusion, emotions of fear at every turn. The media of cartoon narration combined with her minimalistic style is perfect for communicating the absurdities and tradegies of her experience as told from her young yet very sharp mind. Her form has the ability to communicate the horror and absurdity of public beating, torture and severing limbs from the vantage point of a 9-14 year old girl. The form communicates the humorous nature of her emotions as she becomes smitten with her uncle because unlike her father the uncle had been imprisoned. And, it communicates the intelligence of this kid in how she recognizes that a trip wasn't a trip but jail and that her mother was lying to her when she said her uncle's wife sent for him because she knew the wife didn't love him.    And in the story she communicates so much of the tragedy, such as children used in war, the loss of a million people because the revolution need the war with Iraq to continue to stay in power. Tragedies range from her leaving her parents at 14 to the bombing of her neighbors and friend after she had become close to them.    It's wonderful that she could tell this story. I can imagine it's been very therapeutic for her. I couldn't imagine carrying all these things around with her amongst people who don't seem to have experience nearly this level of tragedy. It puts my life into perspective. My problems really don't seem so bad.
B00009P1O0|5.0|After the success of HARVEST, Neil went through a murky period where he released some albums leaving fans begging for another HARVEST. Personally, I really like ON THE BEACH and had to wait a long time for it to be released on Disc.  It contains some of my favorite Neil Young lines. In his recent 2007 tour he performed \\"Ambulance Blues\\" from this CD and I was about one of five people screaming. Some of the songs off this CD appeared on DECADE.
0446577391|5.0|This book grabbed me in the first page and chapter. It kept me through the whole book.  If I'm not interested in the first couple of chapters I will ditch the book, never to touch it again. Or I doze off while reading. Not on this one. I've been raving about Stone Cold til I have friends taking numbers for the next to read it.  Characters are so believable, I now fear for my country or rather those working for it.  Really made me think. My first read of this author.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This CD was advertised as \\"The CD that should have beeen released between AFTER THE GOLDRUSH and HARVEST.\\" It contains new songs that would appear on HARVEST in different form then they would eventually appear.  It is just Neil solo and he is actually very interactive with the audience. This is Neil at ONE of his peaks.  Buy it- and make sure you get the DVD version.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Forget the movie Serenity, this one-and-some-season series is really good, catching on the characters instead of flashy tricks (they use tricks anyway). This is a completely unknown one in Europe, and I was surprised how good it is... or how good it could have been, if they did not cancel. It is a real shame.    I strongly believe the series is much better than the \\"sequel\\" movie, which kind of neglected the characters for the sake of actions.
B000XA5K48|3.0|2007's \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is something different in an action movie.  Every scence of carefully orchestrated violence is over-the-top overdone, on purpose, and the audience is in on the joke.  In scene after scene, a top-notch cast (Clive Owen, Paul Giamatti, and Monica Bulluci) execute, with a straight face, the most improbable gun fights, martial arts sequences, improvisation of weapons from ordinary objects (carrots, anyone) and impossible escapes from dire situations.<br /><br />The plot is fairly straightforward.  A man named Smith (Owen) involves himself in the defense of a pregnant woman pursued by a gang of thugs.  The woman dies, but Smith saves the child.  Smith now finds himself the object of a relentless manhunt by the manical but hilariously hen-pecked hitman Hertz (Giamatti) and his men.  Smith enlists the aid of a lactating prostitute (Bulluci) while going after the conspiracy that has targeted the child.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone.  Those expecting a straight-up action flick are liable to be confused and disappointed.  Those viewers able to grasp the premise (a live action version of the coyotte and the road-runner cartoon, with wonderful hardboiled dialogue) can relax and enjoy a unique presentation; this movie is recommended to that audience.
B000BT97AO|5.0|A movie that takes you on a journey, stopping at humor, fear, riddles, and many elements along the way to an overall destination of a heartwarming epiphany of an ending.  The Imagery throughout is stunningly creative.  The humor is clever and witty.  There are many movies of certain genres that you might label as the greatest movie ever, but if you want a movie that touches every genre and is put together flawlessly this is the movie for you.  My personal favorite movie.
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|all the existentialist clichés about context, juxtaposition, ambiguity, one man adrift in the world defining his reality by what he sees through the lens. If most  found a body in the park they would call the police and/or see if his wallet was still on him. But our anti-hero decides he needs to take a picture to prove to himself it is really there, only by the time he finally gets back to the park it is gone, so reality remains an open question, lost in a pantomime game of tennis, and we are left to ponder if the ball really exist or not.     This movie was considered shocking & ground breaking 40 years ago and for a movie buff that reason alone makes it worth seeing, but don't come to it expecting more than a walk-thru of 60's culture and pop psychology.
B000P0I4O4|2.0|I see John Cusack and Morgan Freeman's face on the cover of a DVD box, I buy it.  Not that these guys have never made a bad movie, but they've certainly never made a movie worse.  The same is true here, although the movie was already pretty bad to begin with.<br /><br />Gym teacher Ray Keene (Cusack at his most vacant) has a pubescent son who is grappling with several dull plot contrivances (the Dead Mom and Infrequent Pot Smoking).  In an attempt to bond with him before he goes too far down the wrong path, Ray takes his boy hiking.  Turns out they BOTH end up down the wrong path, in the middle of which is escaped-assassin, Frank (Freeman, who gives new meaning to the phrase \\"phoning it in\\").  Frank is pursued by his team of assisstants (assassisstants?), who want badly to be paid, but not far behind are also a group of snobbish U.S. Marshalls who have their own agendas.  It's Ray's job to avoid these two deadly (?) forces and bring Frank to justice.<br /><br />No, wait.  Ray's job is a gym coach, making the next several hours of his life a pretty amazing feat, as he scales bluffs, outwits and outmanuevers a whole cadre of military-trained mercenaries and political heavies that appear to have no skills beyond complaining about coffee and smirking smugly at the incompetent local lawmen.  And, to be fair, the local lawmen are remarkably incompetent.<br /><br />Who wrote this thing?  Furthermore, how did they get [[ASIN:B000087F7D Driving Miss Daisy]]'s Bruce Beresford to direct?  That must be, at least, how they got Freeman to lend his Oscar-winning weight to the title.  And that would explain Cusack (because who WOULDN'T want to star next to the incomparable Freeman?).  But none of it explains the script's tired dialogue (\\"You said mom would be okay!\\" Ray's son, Chris, keens.  \\"But she wasn't okay!  She wasn't okay!\\").  None of it explains the crumpled story-line or the ludicrously two-dimensional characters (Alice Krige's skullish Gwen Miles is so flat she seems concaved).  And the plot holes!  Let's just say that they eventually become an acquired taste.  By the time you get to the scene I call the \\"Helicopter Crash Conversation,\\" you'll be shaking your head AND laughing.<br /><br />The really funny thing, though, is that it's obvious SOMEONE put a lot of work into the film.  Certain scenes (the hit-and-run at the start, the accident that leads to Frank's initial capture) are smartly done.  And in the hands of an abler scribe (it was penned by the late Stephen Katz, who did mostly teleplays for [[ASIN:B00005JN80 The A-Team]] and [[ASIN:B000EGGBEO Hardcastle and McCormick]]) it might have pulled together into something you could take a passing interest in.  Instead, there's this silly, incomprehensible glob of a film, notable only for being the first time I've ever seen Morgan Freeman look tired without also thinking he was doing a great job of acting like it.les!

B000R5N1MC|3.0|this \\"ultimate collector's edition\\" is a bit overpriced. you are better off getting the regular 5-disc set. the little knick-knacks in this set are not quite as advertised. they are cheapy-cheap. you are not getting a real autograph from ridley scott, nor a real movie-still frame. it is some mass-produced hologram piece of crap.    the dvd's themselves are great, so just go ahead and save yourself $30 or so and get the regular edition.
0740748475|5.0|This was for my wife and it turned out to be one of her absolute favorite Xmas gifts.

0375847227|5.0|I have researched & read a vast amount of \\"magic lore\\" in the past 35 years or so as a student. Philip Pullman rates up there with other great authors like Madeline L'Engle. He has created a richly woven, engaging story that invites readers to care for and want to know more about the main characters and where they'll end up. Don't give up on the story in the beginning, because it is a complicated plot, but unfurls into an absorbing and fantastic tale. Also, if you're interested in considerations of quantum physics, you won't be disappointed either; the subject is referenced often & probabilities are endless in the story: they get your imagination whirling with \\"what-if?\\" questions. The mythical creatures and beings are amazing and easy to \\"accept\\" (as well as the human ones); as if one understands how they can exist from the recesses of our own life experiences to draw on. Oddly enough, Pullman has been criticized as creating a \\"heretical work,\\" yet the overall message is about our interconnectedness with all that is, and focuses on the ability and urge for all human beings to think for themselves - morally, physically and spiritually - and the importance of love, honor, and the \\"human condition.\\" I loved the innocence and passion of the children, as well as their mistakes. By far this is one of the best books I've ever read.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Great movie.  It was delivered in awsome timeing I recomend this movie to everyone with kids.

1402568851|5.0|I had several friends recommend this book.  I wanted to hear it on audio CD and was very pleased that it  was narrated by Jeff Woodman, one of AudioFile Magazine's \\"Best Voices of the Century\\", whom I had also heard reading \\"Life of PI\\".  The teenaged boy telling the story has Asperger's syndrome (high functioning autism)  and I recommend this book for anyone who not only wants to understand the inner world of someone with  this condition, but who likes a poignant story which respects all of the characters.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Everyone needs to be reminded of the Golden Rule now and then and this movie classic does that in an oh-so-gentle way.  It reminds us that our good deeds will come back to us ten fold - usually when we least expect it.  Should be on the list of \\"must see\\" movies for all of our younger generation!

B000QFCD5O|4.0|The two CDs are as much a chronicle of the careers of these four outstanding musicians as it is on the surprising staying power of Asia's oftentimes much derided body of work.<br /><br />And this is not a group that is simply cruising on the hits from the past; this is a solid performance by individuals who truly understand the strategy of utilizing the stage as a grand avenue to interpret studio concepts.<br /><br />Geoff Downes, Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and John Wetton took progressive rock - with a unique wall-of-sound - and placed it solidly onto the pop charts some 25 years ago. Fantasia arguably is the best live release in 2007.
1402590407|5.0|Alexandra Fuller is such a talented writer.  I have read \\"Dogs\\" twice as it reminds me of my own African childhood.  I have given it to friends who have loved it, so I decided it was time to listen to it on audio CD.  I enjoyed it tremendously.  Lisette Lecat's accents are wonderful and I could picture a young Bobo Fuller even more vividly than when I'd read the book.  I found myself laughing in my car at times and couldn't wait to get back into the car so I could continue listening to Bobo's fascinating childhood story.  In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I am currently listening to Scribbling The Cat on audio CD.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|As a long time fan of Radiohead, I could not resist purchasing their limited edition discbox directly from their site.  With it came an exclusive early download of \\"In Rainbows\\".  Needless to say I have been listening to this album for the past few months.  It hardly seems new anymore.    As great as this album could be, sadly it is not.  I hold certain expectations from Radiohead.  Not because of what people say about them, but because of what they have done in the past.  Some of the better tracks on this album include Reckoner & Bodysnatchers.  I enjoy most of the bass lines as they add depth to the songs.  Selway's drumming is uniformly simple that I can't say great things about it.  In previous albums he presents an artful clarity that subliminally adds complexity (e.g. Pyramid Song, Dollars & Cents, Optimistic, Paranoid Android).    I feel that they used a lot of their energies pursuing individual careers that Radiohead as a whole suffered some by it.  Still it was nice for us long time fans to hear a final version of Nude a.k.a. Big Ideas (don't get any) [I erroneously wrote 'Big Boots' which was a different track. Thanks for pointing that out] after such a long time of hearing working/live versions.    $9.99 is a very good price for this album.  I would buy it now for the few tracks that are amazing.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This box set is so great!  I've been looking for this series on DVD for 5 years and every time I found it the price was crazy.  I'm sssooo glad they finally released the entire season again.  The way the DVDs come in a little book with a bookmark and everything is so cute.   It's also filled with extras and pictures for us to enjoy.  Now I can have Jordan at any time.  This box set rocks! And it's totally worth the price!
0307387151|5.0|Reading this is like experiencing the beauty of contemplating a giant landscape - the style embodies a unity, a symmetry, a homogeneity - a gently throbbing and satisfying rhythm of oneness as one's gaze roams and hovers over page after page.     Every one of life's moments encapsulates a myriad of philosophical, psychological and historical components - all having threaded their way though particular configurations of circumstance to culminate in that moment. McEwan is a master of splitting the atom of these moments - unpacking for our wonder and delight these bundles of reality, in a style that is delicate and precise - a hallmark of his craft.     In a human narrative each of these moments is seen differently from the perspective of the various players. It is another feature of McEwan's craft that he burrows in and explodes each of these, subsequently weaving the understanding gleaned back together into a more refined understanding of the greater picture.     Beyond these exquisite niceties, a novel should naturally also be a good yarn, and McEwan is a wonderful story teller, maintaining a fine balance between fancy and feasibility. As a reader I experience the tension between wanting uplifting, happy outcomes and being prepared for gritty reality checks. Without giving too much away, in this book McEwan gives us both, with the slightest of sleights of hand - and in the last two pages of the book at that! With similar dextrous economy, the portal to this denouement is presented in the cypher of a set of initials and a date at the end of part three (of four).     The book is something of a saga, spanning 64 years and several generations. McEwan gives us a good feel for each of the periods covered. The 80 or so pages treating of the war have been researched in a novel way and the representation of war is a relief from war of the movies - even the better ones. Here we get the true horror and terror. Also a terrific flavour of the societal context in which this war was experienced in Britain. Towards the end he also gives us an insightful portrayal of an elderly mind surveying its life from the closing end of its journey.     The love story at the heart of 'Atonement' echoes Lawrence's portrayal of the oppositions and physicalities at the heart of romantic involvement. Indeed the male of the story likely read the word at the centre of the storm here unleashed in a student reading of Lady Chatterley.     In the end atonement is made - and McEwan and we accept it.     A personal note: For certain reasons I have been unable to muster the mental wherewithal to take up a book and read for nearly 2 years. I finally felt up to giving it a try, and 'Atonement' was the book with which I tried. Not only did the book turn out to be a good one with which to return to reading, but I read it over just 3 days.

B000TLTUL0|4.0|The story of Sweeney Todd is what Charles Dickens might have come up with had he used Jonathan Swift's \\"A Modest Proposal\\" as his source of inspiration.  Of course, in a Dickens version, all those who found themselves on the wrong side of Todd's razor would be venal exploiters of the poor and working classes who clearly deserved the fate that befell them.  In Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of the story, however, people of virtually all social categories and walks of life get tossed indiscriminately into the meat grinder, in as grim a spectacle of democratic equanimity as we`ve encountered in quite some time.  For this is a tale of a man who allows the desire for vengeance to so completely overtake him that he quickly turns from being a righteous avenging angel seeking justice for himself and his loved ones to a maniacal serial murderer who kills for the sheer sake of killing (with a little culinary treat thrown in as a side benefit).<br /><br />Benjamin Barker starts off as a good-natured barber living with his impossibly sweet wife and brand new baby daughter in 19th Century London.  When a corrupt judge who has designs on Barker's wife throws the young man into prison on false charges, Barker transforms into a gloomy and bitter man, determined to exact his revenge on the individual who ruined his life, drove his wife to suicide and has made Barker's now-teenaged daughter an object of his unwanted, lascivious advances.  On his arrival back in London once again a free man, Barker changes his name to Sweeney Todd and resumes business in the barber shop located above Mrs. Lovett's thoroughly unhygienic meat pie emporium where the cockroaches barely outnumber the raisins in the recipe.  Eventually, the two entrepreneurs hit upon a scheme to systematically slice the throats of Todd's customers, then add the bodily remains to Mrs. Lovett's list of secret culinary ingredients.<br /><br />With \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,\\" director Tim Burton has finally found the material he was born to make.  Dark as well as surrealistic, morbid as well as operatic, \\"Sweeney Todd\\" perfectly fits the Tim Burton style and temperament, and, indeed, the filmmaker has taken full advantage of the opportunity afforded by the property, allowing his imagination to run wild in the areas of art direction, set decoration, costume design and makeup.  Yet, while this is a beautifully crafted film from a technical standpoint, Burton never allows the visuals to overshadow the storyline or the characters.<br /><br />\\"Sweeney Todd\\" is clearly not intended for all audiences.  It is certainly a different kind of musical, pitch-dark and violent and with no real choreography to speak of.  And any hopes for a sentimental, happily-ever-after resolution are washed away by the sanguinary nature of the scenario and a closing shot that is literally a tableaux steeped in blood.  Yet, there is one element that makes it all connect with audiences, and that is Johnny Depp's performance.  Depp could not have found a role more perfectly suited to his demeanor and talents than that of Sweeny Todd.  Never before has his brooding intensity and expression of wild-eyed mania been used to more impressive effect than it is here.  He makes a character whom it is often very hard to like into a person the audience can feel for and care about, no small feat in light of the many reprehensible actions he performs on screen.  Depp also does a more-than-adequate job with Sondheim's challenging tunes, especially given the actor's clearly limited range as a singer.<br /><br />Depp gets strong support from Helena Bonham Carter as his pasty-faced, death-hued partner-in-crime, Mrs. Lovett, while Sasha Baron Cohen and Alan Rickman bring subtle shadings to their otherwise hiss-able villains.d the material he was born to make.

1401308201|5.0|I saw \\"Wicked\\" in Chicago and absolutely loved it.  This book is like the \\"ology\\" books for grown-ups.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  It's also a very attractive book.  The pictures on this site do not do it justice.
B00000K3CM|5.0|If you liked Home Alone, then Home Alone 2 is even better so this is for you. This movie is such a classic like the first one. I give to this funny classic TWO THUMBS UP!
B0007OY2MG|1.0|This isn't a review on the product but rather on the process of attempting to change an order less than 24 hours after it was placed but before it was shipped. I attempted to change season 3 for season 4 when I found out that I ordered the wrong season. Because it was ordered with another item that together qualified for free shipping, sending one item back and reordering the correct item triggered shipping charges which they gave me a voucher to cover and then charged me for when crediting my credit card. In the future if I order from Amazon again, if I need to return 1 item of an order, I would just send the whole thing back.
B000RO9PXC|4.0|\\"Live in Boston 1970\\" is the rough-edged \\"warts and all\\" Doors release we've all been waiting for. Jim Morrison feels no pain during these unpredictable Boston Arena concerts - propelled by the brilliant playing of Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek and John Densmore. The results are occasionally sloppy, yet often compelling musically. Jimbo really lets loose with his stream-of-consciousness rapping and engaging blues covers. When considering his inebriated state, it's amazing that Morrison performed two shows in a single night. Historic document, indeed.
B000VR824S|4.0|Amazing performances from a variety of Guitar players, including but not limited to: Sonny Landreth, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Johnny Winter, Vince Gill and Willie Nelson...etc. I was also impressed with Jeff Becks young Bass Player. That girl can play.     This DVD reminded me of all wonderful guitar players that we take for granted. Every one brought a different style to the show. If you enjoy guitar music this is one of the DVDs to add to your collection.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE WHEN IT WAS ON TV.  WANTED A COPY TO SHARE WITH FRIENDS.  WHEN WE SHARED EVERYONE HAD A GOOD LAUGH.  JACK NICHOLSON AND DIANE KEATON WERE MARVELOUS.  WE HAVE ALWAYS LOVED JACK NICHOLSON AND NOW WE LOVE DIANE KEATON.
B000X1Z0BU|3.0|I ordered a number (5 or 6) of items at one time.  I followed your instructions and I was sort of surprised at how they shipped.  Also disappointed in some communications (NOT WITH AMAZON).  With concern for the timely delivery of items I agreed to multiple shipments, it seemed like each item came seperately.  Might have made more sense to put into one box, maybe lower cost?  Also tried to find out how to return an item you don't stock but the shipper chose to ignore requests for info on a return.  At this point do not know if this has been resolved.  My only suggestion would be to be more clear in your instructions and info on different ship dates for multiple itms.  Ultimately I may just have misunderstood what you would do and when.  Overall I'd give Amazon a B+ on this order, maybe even A-!  Thanks for the opportunity.  Fred Wordell
B000VNMMPM|4.0|You may consider this Luc Besson's version of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" set in 21st century Paris. Jamel is not<br />George Bailey and Rie's not Clarence(or Amelie)-they're thrown together into a hard deep noir world of lies and vice. Perhaps \\"La Femme Nikita\\" afoot in a tiny black dress, swimming with loan sharks?<br /><br />While Jimmie Stewart wrestled with fate in Shakespearean terms we see Jamel opened petal by hardened petal by Rie's Angela to a gnostic awareness of his soul and love, as the viewer is too. I came to care for both of them and thoroughly enjoyed the journey and the City of Light. May you enjoy it too.<br /><br />Besson is a master storyteller and his use of black and white is both a blessing and a tribute.
B0002S947K|5.0|Even though there are only 10 tracks on this CD, all of them are worth listening to.  I can listen to this CD over and over...Ray's voice is smooth and his music is mellow.  He music is laid back-like a mix between Jack Johnson and John Mayer.  I want to buy all of his music :)
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is truly an amazing DVD collection. I got this for my husband for Christmas because we recently got a Blu Ray DVD player. I had read that the series was incredible since it is filmed in high def. It lives up to everything I have heard. When you start to watch it you cannot believe the clarity and the scenes are amazing. I highly recommend this series to anyone with high def equipment.
B000089RW0|5.0|This movie was in great condition and played so clean and neatly.  Definitly worth the viewing
B000R8YC18|5.0|It's a great movie! De Niro at his finest.    \\"You talking to me?\\"
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This third edition of the trials and tribulations of Jason Bourne does not dissapoint!  It is fast paced, action-packed, and filled with twists and turns of the plot.  The special effects are pretty neat, too.  It would help your enjoyment if you had seen the previous two, but that is not required.  Bottom line - buy this movie if you would like to watch a good 'ole action movie.

B000784WMW|5.0|Really nice version of a favorite classic, although Timothy Dalton is really too good looking to be an acurate Mr. Rochester. Very enjoyable.
0143038419|1.0|If you can stomach the first 90 or so pages of this book, you'll probably enjoy the rest. I had to read it for book club or I never would have finished. This chick is so self-absorbed and pampered she just doesn't get it. Why so many women love this book is beyond me.     She spends the first 90 pages crying because she's unhappy. So, do something about it -- get a prescription or make some changes.    And, of course, she eventually does. How easy to make a year long journey of self discovery -- especially when you get an advance to pay for the whole thing. It's all about her, her, her. She really doesn't learn much except to indulge herself even more.    I can't help but feel that folks who find her story inspiring are spoiled navel-gazers and need to do some volunteer work for the less fortunate to get over themselves.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|A very good interpretation of one of my favorite classics. Believeable casting and gorgeous scenery. Very well done.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\", the new film from Paul Thomas Anderson (\\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"Magnolia\\" and \\"Punch Drunk Love\\") stars Daniel Day Lewis as oil prospector Daniel Plainview. While I know many people did not like \\"Magnolia\\", \\"Blood\\" is about as different as could be from the director's other works. And it stars Daniel Day Lewis, who, as far as I'm concerned has never turned in a bad performance.<br /><br />Gee, Daniel Day Lewis creates a memorable screen persona, burning up the celluloid with another incendiary performance. At this point in the actor's career, this statement is a clich&eacute;. He has never done anything less than command our attention when on screen. From his breakout performance in \\"My Beautiful Launderette\\" to his co-starring role in \\"The Gangs of New York\\" when he diverted our attention from Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz (Diaz was in \\"Gangs of New York\\"?), Lewis imbues his characters with such a believable force, so much life, it is impossible to tear our eyes away from him. Lewis also takes his time making films, choosing only a project every few years, making his fans wait in anticipation for his next work.<br /><br />Daniel Plainview (Lewis) is digging a hole in California at the end of the 19th Century. He is looking for gold, or oil, we can't be sure, because the first twenty minutes of the film is almost silent. Daniel is prospecting alone, so who would he talk to? We witness the hard work, the travails, the agony, he goes through, as he looks for an elusive fortune. He finds some gold and is able to invest the money in a larger operation. As he and an assistant are buried in muck, trying to drill even deeper, a piece of the apparatus above them breaks off and comes crashing down. Daniel is spared, but his assistant is dead, leaving behind a baby boy. Daniel adopts the boy, and introduces him as HW Plainview, whenever they meet with people. Flash forward ten years; Daniel and HW (Dillon Frasier) are very successful, beating out the big oil companies for some potentially big properties. One night, Paul Sunday (Paul Dano, \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\") arrives and wants money for the location of a well that he is sure will be profitable; the oil is seeping out of the ground. Daniel is reluctant, but he and HW travel to the Sunday ranch and meet Paul's twin brother, Eli, a healer and the head of a local church. Daniel becomes convinced the land is rich with oil and tries to make a deal with Abel Sunday (David Willis), who defers most of the decision to his son; Eli wants money to help expand his church. As the deal goes forward, Daniel bristles at all of Eli's interference. Just as the well is about to come in, an accident happens to HW, putting more and more strain on Daniel. Will he be able to handle all of the various demands on his life as he struggles with trying to get HW the help he needs and he struggles with the larger oil companies trying to squeeze him out of the equation?<br /><br />Director Paul Thomas Anderson has created quite an eclectic body of work. I personally think \\"Magnolia\\" is a great film. But I know many people hate it, for various reasons. There doesn't seem to be any in-between; either you love it or hate it. But \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a very different film; in fact it is very different from anything the director has done before. \\"Blood\\", based on a novel by Upton Sinclair, concentrates on three characters; Daniel is the primary character and the main driving force in the film, but the story is also about HW and Eli, focusing on their interactions with Daniel. There are, of course, other characters in the film, but they are nowhere near as important and take a backseat to anything and everything the other characters are doing. This is quite a switch from \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"Magnolia\\", both of which featured large casts of characters interacting in strange environments. \\"Punch Drunk Love\\", a smaller, intimate film, is similar to \\"There Will Be Blood\\" in that both deal with fewer people, but \\"Blood\\" is a very different film, an epic showing the struggles of one man and his son as they deal with many factors in turn of the century California.<br /><br />If \\"Blood\\" does nothing else, you should come away from it with the realization that Anderson is capable of making different types of films. But when you leave the theater, you will hopefully realize you have just experienced an epic. From the first twenty minutes, which are largely silent, ambient noise and the occasional grunt are all that is heard, this film is all about Daniel Plainview's journey. Because the film is long, t runs about two hours and forty-five minutes, we experience a lot with this character. The film's length is actually a selling point, as it gives us a lot of insight into this character's life. As we watch Lewis portray this determined oil prospector, we see all of the fight he has in him, the drive he has to become a rich, powerful man. During the first few minutes, Plainview suffers an accident and the end result is great testament to what he will endure to become rich and powerful. Over the course of the film, this is illustrated many other times, in different ways, with varying effects, giving the character a terrific, vibrant personality.<br /><br />Lewis, wearing a thick moustache, is never anything less than mesmerizing on screen as Daniel Plainview. A very quiet man, he doesn't speak a lot, but you always know he is in charge. As Daniel stares at you, if his eyes slant, you should beware. When he does speak, to address large groups of people, it is quite evident he is choosing every word very carefully; to make sure he gets the desired effect. Even when he has conversations with his son, or a colleague (Ciaran Hinds), you get the feeling he realizes he is doing the same thing and trying to tone it down a bit, to make him more approachable to the people he loves and works closely with.<br /><br />But does Plainview love or care about anyone or anything but money and power? That is the real question behind this performance. I'm not sure. There are indications throughout that Plainview really cares about his son. But he makes a statement casting doubt on this. Did he say this because his son hurt him and he was trying to get back at him? There is a lot of ambiguity in this part of their relationship and this adds to Plainview's character.<br /><br />Plainview is never shown with a woman. He doesn't have time for them. He is too busy working, trying to find oil wells, trying to convince people they should sign leases with him, trying to assuage their fears, while keeping as much money as possible in his pockets. He puts all of his efforts into the business, and a rivalry he develops with the people from Standard Oil. Everything else goes to his son. As Plainview attains more and more money and power, he naturally becomes obsessed with keeping both. He becomes a little paranoid. And his son's condition doesn't help.<br /><br />The other force in \\"Blood\\" is Paul Dano. He plays twin brothers Eli and Paul Sunday. Despite a brief scene, Paul, the black sheep of the Sunday family disappears. Eli is the son who lives with the family and is a healer, the minister of his own church. When Plainview and his son show up, and make an offer to his dad, Eli's father seems eager to jump at the sale. But he ultimately defers to his son, who wants Daniel to make a donation to his church, to help it expand. As their relationship continues, Eli becomes a thorn in Daniel's side, preventing the prospector from getting everything he wants, immediately when he wants it. This makes him a problem for Daniel, a problem he needs to contend with.<br /><br />The relationship between the two men is antagonistic, yet they never scream or shout at each other. This doesn't rob the film of any fireworks. Before the first well on the Sunday Ranch is about to go into operation, Eli asks Daniel to let him bless it in front of his congregation. Daniel agrees andpretty much the entire town shows up to witness HW start the drill. Before his son does this, Daniel addresses the group and blesses the operation himself, leaving Eli in the audience to stare at the ceremony blankly. Daniel knows what he is doing and usurping the authority of the lone authority figure in the small community only serves to do one thing; make Daniel more powerful. But Eli isn't about to let the issue drop. Later, an unforeseen circumstance allows Eli to get the upper hand, making Daniel all the more paranoid.<br /><br />Dano is good, and manages to create an interesting character opposite the hurricane that is Daniel Day Lewis. Because he is a lesser-know actor, the expectations for him are lower and the fact that he can hold his own against Lewis says something for the up-and-comer. DiCaprio didn't fare as well.<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a very good film. But after spending the bulk of the time with Daniel and HW at a specific time, the film jumps forward a number of years, to 1927, for an epilogue set at Daniel's huge mansion. The epilogue is interesting, and powerful, but because it skips so many years, it seems a bit tacked on. Did Anderson cut something from the story to get to this point? Probably. The epilogue is not quite as seamless with the rest of the film and because this is the last thing we see, we leave with mixed emotions. To spend so much time, with such a forceful personality, we would expect the epilogue to continue delivering the power of the rest of the film. When it doesn't, it is a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />That said, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is still an extremely good, very powerful film, featuring one of the best performances you are ever likely to see on film.formance.

0743243153|5.0|I remember receiving this book as a gift from an aunt of mine a number of years ago and reading it more out of an attempt to show appreciation to her than out of interest. Well, was I pleasantly surprised! Remembering this, I recently decided to read it again. M. Scott Pecks' Road Less Travelled is filled with deep, penetrating and original insights that most people at some level would concur are true. This is a book about spiritual growth, and specifically the author's view of how this can be achieved, and upon completion of it one cannot help but feel that he has succeeded to a large extent in illuminating the path towards such a noble, but difficult, objective. Many readers, after having completed this book, will feel that there is in fact meaning and purpose to life, and that is why this book can be a life-changer. That been said, however, do be prepared for some interesting surprises as you continue through it!        Being about psychotherapy and how this is actually a route to spiritual growth (as Peck states, psychological maturity is synonymous with spiritual growth), one of these surprises was to find Scott-Peck become quite mystical and philosophical in his writing the further you read, but in a way that makes sense and is quite convincing. In addition, many people would think that a book dealing with spiritual growth would be related to Christianity and its concept of God, while in actual fact the book encompasses much more than this. Indeed, it struck me, once I started reading the parts on Growth and Grace that the author has tried to put into modern words and concepts many of the things which the mystics and great seers of the past taught and believed. This was confirmed when in the chapter on the Welcoming of Grace, near the end of the book, we read: \\"One way or another these concepts have been set forth before - by Buddha, by Christ, by Lao-tse, among many others. The originality of this book results from the fact that I have arrived at their same meaning through the particular individual byways of my twentieth-century life.\\" Some readers, especially the more scientific-minded, may be put off by the fact that the book becomes mystical and philosophical the more we progress through it. Such readers should however stay the course as this is an excellent book which anyone can benefit from, especially since it also deals with psychology and how one can improve their life. There is much wisdom in this book. I myself am very interested in science and quite well read on the latest scientific developments yet I did not find the author's statements about things like the unconscious mind being God, or serendipitous experiences, a turn -off. I think one day we are going to find that there is far more to this existence than the mundane \\"blind, pitiless indifference\\" and accidental universe taught and believed by many leading scientists who are adherents to scientific materialism. But that is only my opinion. Most people would concur that there certainly are experiences and events which cannot be explained by science, which itself is far too preoccupied with objective, measurable phenomena than the equally real subjective and un-measurable phenomena.     One of the insights provided in the book is the author's definition of love, which will be very different to what most people think love is. Real love is effort! Romantic feelings do (almost) always fade away! Love is not a feeling! To be truly loving is to make an effort for the benefit of another individual even when one does not feel like it or when it offers no direct reward to oneself. Nobody likes to make an effort because it drains your energy, but when you do so i.e. extend yourself for the benefit of another, then in many ways you are being truly loving. A typical example would be marriage. To make a marriage work when the romantic feelings of grandeur and excitement have passed requires effort, work and courage - i.e. the will to extend oneself for the benefit ofanother's spiritual growth. It was especially humorous to note the author's notion that romantic love, with its feelings of omnipotence and ecstasy (which is what a young baby feels when in its mother's arms - but which in the years ahead will have to grow up and break away and look after itself), is in reality a trap designed by evolution to snare people to mate in order to ensure the propagation of the species because the feelings always pass sooner or later and consequently most couples get married in total bliss unaware of what lies ahead. If most people really knew what marriage was all about and what lay ahead later on and how much work is involved in letting a marriage work, they would tremble at the mere thought of marriage vows and would not get married! At least, in the author's opinion.    So what is the road to spiritual growth that the author lays out for his readers, and the underlying message of this book?  We have lost our spirituality and sense of purpose and meaning in life because we believe in the mechanical nature of the universe, not in miracles. Science tells us that not only are we lost and insignificant amid the enormity of the universe, but that we are also helplessly determined by internal forces not subject to our will - by chemicals within our brain and conflicts in our unconscious that compel us to feel and to behave in certain ways when we are not even aware of what we are doing. Because of this we suffer a sense of personal meaninglessness. But once we perceive the reality of grace, our understanding of ourselves as meaningless and insignificant is shattered. The fact that there exists beyond ourselves and our conscious will grace, being a powerful force that nurtures our growth and evolution, is enough to change our notions of insignificance forever, because once we perceive it, it indicates with certainty that our human spiritual growth is of the utmost importance to something greater than ourselves, namely God, and that God's willis devoted to the growth of the individual human spirit. The reality of grace indicates humanity to be at the centre of the universe. The author further asserts that we are born that we might become, as a conscious individual, a new life form of God, and also that the interface between God and man is at least in part the interface between our unconscious and our conscious minds. Our unconscious is God within us (like the Holy Spirit). Spiritual growth is a process of the conscious mind coming into synchrony with the unconscious. The collective unconscious is God; the conscious is man as individual; and the personal unconscious is the interface between them. Being this interface, it is inevitable that the personal unconscious (subconscious mind) should be a place of some turmoil, the scene of some struggle between God's will and the will of the individual. Mental illness occurs when the conscious will of the individual deviates substantially from the will of God, which is the individual's own unconscious will. Our conscious self concept almost always diverges from the reality of the person we actually are. The unconscious however knows who we really are, and therefore a an essential task in the process of one's spiritual development is the continuous work of bringing one's conscious self-concept into agreement with reality, because our unconscious is wiser than we are. We live our lives in a real world and to live them well it is necessary that we come to understand the reality of the world as best we can. Many aspects of the reality of the world and of our relationship to the world are painful to us. We can understand them only through effort and suffering. People attempt to avoid this effort and suffering and ignore the painful aspects of reality by blocking and throwing certain unpleasant facts out of their awareness. In other words, we attempt to defend our consciousness, our awareness against reality. If in our laziness and fear of suffering (these two things being the impediments to spiritual growth, caused by lack of discipline and by non-love) we defend our awareness, then it will happen that our understanding of the world and our actions will bear little or no relation to reality, and we will eventually become `out of touch with reality' and be deemed mentally ill. But before this extreme occurs, we are given notice by our unconscious of our increasing maladjustment through a variety of means: bad dreams, anxiety, depression and other symptoms. Although our conscious mind has denied reality, our unconscious, which is omniscient, knows the true score and attempts to help us out by stimulating, through symptom formation, our conscious mind to the awareness that something is wrong. In other words, the painful and unwanted symptoms of mental illness are manifestations of grace. They are the products of `a powerful force originating outside of consciousness which nurtures our spiritual growth.' Psychic phenomena are also clearly related to the operation of the unconscious.     The author further asserts that that are two forces at work on humanity: entropy and evolution (analogous to how these two fundamental laws work in physical science). Laziness is the force of entropy within us, pushing us down and holding us all back from spiritual evolution, because the process of spiritual growth is an effortful and difficult one, due to it being conducted against a natural resistance and natural inclination to keep things the way they were and to cling to the old maps and the old way of dong things ie. to take the easy path. But the miracle is that this resistance is overcome and we do grow. This force that pushes us as individuals and as a species to grow against the natural resistance of our own laziness is love - the will to extend oneself for one's or another's spiritual growth. Therefore love is evolution in progress. The origin of love (which is conscious and is the whole force of evolution) and of grace (which is unconscious) the author states, is a God who loves us and who wants us to grow. \\"We are growing toward godhood. God is the goal of evolution. It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination\\" declares the author.      One minor issue I had with the book is that the author could have included some exercises on how we may develop our unconscious minds and thereby how to manifest synchronous events, because, in his own words, \\"A major purpose of the section on grace has been to assist those on the purpose of spiritual growth to learn the capacity of serendipity. And let us redefine serendipity not as a gift itself but as a learned capacity to recognise and utilise the gifts of grace which are given to us from beyond the realm of our conscious will. With this capacity, we will find that our journey of spiritual growth is guided by the invisible hand and unimaginable wisdom of God with infinitely greater accuracy than that of which our unaided unconscious will is capable. So guided, the journey becomes ever faster.\\" There are quality books (ie. not new age mumbo-jumbo) on meditation and development of human abilities that teach one how to do this, and perhaps the author could have included some exercises for his readers. But all in all, this is a very interesting book that seems to summarise the great teachings of the past in the language of our modern-day world and which has the potential bring meaning and purpose into the lives of many who need it.
B000A88EVE|5.0|I'm not certain how I came upon this film years ago. I read that Bowie wanted to make a film of Heinlein's \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" and, unable to do that, was intrigued by this somewhat similar tale by Tevis. Since then it has haunted me, or Bowie's performance has. Roeg had problems with the production, so it ended up not being the film he wanted because of issues with the studio, editing, and $$$, thus gaps and holes that make it choppy. If you want a film with a message or happy ending, this isn't it. This definitely is a cult classic!  Bowie was heavily on drugs while filming, but since (his character) Newton crashed to Earth from a dry planet and is alien in Every Way, it's hard to tell if the drugs affected his performance. Bowie's Newton was initially determined, brilliant, and optimistic as he arrived on his Earth mission, then so haunted and doomed as the \\"animal\\" betrayed by Man. I thought his acting better in \\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\\", but he is extremely adept at roles as the tormented, the sufferer. (He also played \\"The Elephant Man\\" off-Broadway.) Is he successful in these roles, perhaps, because of the juxtaposition of playing such a beautiful man unable to enjoy the gifts God gave him? As we watch Newton's sad, inevitable story, we are a captive audience, we cannot help yet are also unable to tear ourselves away.  And, as a cult audience, we do it over and over.  I especially love the end of this film when Dr. Bryce sees Newton in the outdoor cafe. I watch Newton as such a sad, trapped alien, more beautiful than ever, still determined to get home, with a regal dignity. In the finale, as his head drops, we pity him for what he has become, what we have made of him, but he is still more noble and a better \\"man\\" than Bryce and those who have brought him down.  The final scene and the jazz always leaves me emotionally drained.  Always.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We purchased this for our 19 year old son.  We sat and watched it together and all I can say is Awesome.
B000FJGWBC|4.0|So maybe this movie didn't winning any awards, and it may not go down in history as one of the timeless classics, but my wife and I watched it together and it held our attention.  Not to mention the fact that the beach/ocean and Jessica Alba shots are the reason they invented HD in the first place.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is simply another amazing movie from Pixar. Yet another classical masterpiece that will move you, make you laugh and touch you in so many places, that it should be considered a crime.    Although the story part, from the outside would seem rather thin. It is actually very well played. And the animation is beyond this world, this is simply one of the best movies from the year 2007.    If you haven't seen it. Then do it.  And if you like it, i recommend you buy it, there are dozen of hours in the extras. [[ASIN:B000VBJEEG Ratatouille]]
B00005JO5L|3.0|There's a certain expectation of sensationalism that comes with watching a William Friedkin film - one scene that will have your jaw dropping at the audaciousness of it, and that stays with you long after. Cruising, however, doesn't.  It's a well-crafted work, to be sure, and features great performances from supporting players Karen Allen and Paul Sorvino, but ultimately it leaves one with a sense of dissatisfaction. Friedkin here delves deep into New York's gay underworld of leather bars and kinky sex (he's not representing it as the whole of the lifestyle, just a subculture), occasionally spicing it up with a murder scene.  It's really a showcase for the formidable talents of Al Pacino (before the hysteria of his later work)here as an undercover cop investigating the brutal slayings of men who all seem to share the same lifestyle.  It's not bad Friedkin (like Jade or The Guardian) or brilliant Friedkin (Sorcerer, The French Connection), just very, very, average Friedkin. There's nothing memorable going on here for his fans, but does get a solid performace from Pacino. Not for all tastes.

0740748475|5.0|This is only for the true calvin and hobbes fan, and who isn't!  A beautifully bound three volume book.  The paper is heavy gauge and the text starts from the very begining-in black and white-later changing to color.  I could not believe how heavy this set is-it feels like at least 50 lbs. Very high class set to preserve the memory of one of the most imaginative cartoon charaters ever created. Definetly worth the money.
0143038419|4.0|Thoroughly delightful book which I could relate to. The book covers almost everything from the mondaine to the spiritual - and it all happened in one year, wow!!! My journey took very much longer and to more countries. I gave the book to my daughters and friends and tell everybody about it and now my husband is reading it too.
0439882826|5.0|I bought this for my grandson, who is into the Star Wars thing.  He LOVED it, named all the characters as we opened all the little pop-ups.  The author really knows how to present the story & the light-up light sabers were the best!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I purchased this DVD set for my son for Christmas, kind of \\"spur of the moment.\\" He'd been wanting them for several Christmases and never got them.  I ordered thru Amazon and figured I'd just have to wrap up a \\"note\\" to tell my son they DVDs would be coming later, but no! They arrived at least a week before Christmas (can't remember the exact day). I was very pleased.  Thanks so much.
0307346617|4.0|Max Brooks has outdone himself with the latest Zombie Tales.  These stories he has put together are so great, that they are a good example of how things would turn out as if an Zombie outbreak would to happen.  Its just not the stories themselves but the places, this book do capture the attitudes of people around the world as they tell thier stories of survival.  As a Zombie fan you will love the stories because Max has a way of bringing out the story as if you were there living it.  One of the places he described, I have visited, it was almost as if he had visited it and that is what hooked me.  Hopefully when they do the movie, they will do the book justice and not skimp on the details.  Buy this book and enjoy it.  Should something like this ever happen, I promise you that if you truly comprehend this book, you will survive.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|WOW what a set to own.  The footage was way cool and seeing AC/DC in its early years was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Bon Scott made his singing look so easy and the songs he wrote are fantastic and many.  To see Angus Young in his early years, what a nut case and it exhausted us just watching him play and run around, spin on his back on stage.  He has to be one of the worlds greatest guitar players.  The SAGA of AC/DC was WAY COOL.  This album is Golden and a MUST HAVE for any AC/DC FAN.  Old footage and new was great and it was really neat to see the differences between Bon Scott and Brian Johnson. Man what a set to have forever.  LEGENDS of Rock and this set should be LEGENDS of DVD's.
1400049628|4.0|This is the first Max Brooks Zombie book I read and liked.  Survival Guide indeed.  This book talks about how Zombie outbreak occured, how the goverments conceals it.  It shares stories from around the world from past outbreaks.  Nothing like World War Z.  But this guide does one thing that no other book does.  It prepares you.  This book is fiction but is written as if it is true.  It tells you what weapons to use, what mode of transportation to use, How to travel, how to fight, what to wear.  Even how to work together to stay alive.  What I find interesting about this book is that: One can take away from this book as use its techniques.  You don't have to have a zombie outbreak, this book could have helped the victims of Katrina, future survivors of most disaters.  I recommend you read this book for pure enjoyment, for others who can comprehend that this is a true survival guide, will get even more out of it.
9562911640|5.0|Back in 1912, long before \\"The Secret\\" movie came out, Charles Hannel explained the Law of Attraction.  He shows us that mental power is creative power, and that what we think about is what we attract into our life.  He makes the point that the world within is the cause, and the world without is the effect.<br /><br />In The Master Key, he provides 24 lessons all related to the power of thought.  The lessons cover such topics as:<br />- the proper use of the subconscious mind<br />- the power of nonresistant thought<br />- the real nature of the \\"I\\" is spiritual<br />- how visualization works<br />- the 3 things all mankind desires (health, wealth & love)<br />- what it means to know the \\"Truth\\"<br />- the effortlessness of concentration<br />- and many, many more lessons on the power of thought<br /><br />He also makes the very important point that the only value to any principle is in its application.  So simply reading this book won't have any impact.  You have to apply the principles.  He helps you to do that by providing exercises at the end of each of the 24 lessons in the book.  They start out very general and then each exercise builds on the prior one.  So, for instance, the first exercise just says to sit still for 15 minutes, letting your thoughts roam where they will.  The second exercise has you again sit still, but this time tells you to begin to control your thoughts, and so on through the 24th exercise.  His intent is that you do one exercise per week.  Through the exercises, he brings you from an intellectual understanding of the principles to an actual experience of the principles.<br /><br />This is a very powerful book, which I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a more meaningful life.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This is an excellent program that follows real life situations. It gives a view into the lives of the engineers and astronauts as they prepare to go to the moon.  Great job!!!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Anyone who has ever enjoyed the Alien series must have this set...(If they don't already, of course.)  The Special Features are excellent and highly informative for even the most discerning fan.  The \\"Director's Cuts\\" of each film are also worthwhile, with the exception of Aliens, which is just a rerelease of a previous dir. cut.  Overall, this set was well worth it.  A fitting release for a scifi legacy.

B000QY4ZXI|2.0|I thought His Dark Materials started very strong in the first book of the trilogy and ended here with a whimper. It is ultimately disappointing because Pullman really seems to have an ax to grind and it interferes with his otherwise brilliant storytelling. This became really apparent in The Amber Spyglass and his target was specifically Christianity (not Islam, Judaism or any other faith).    Ironically, what he attacked has little to do with the Christian faith at all. In a nutshell, Pullman focuses on a substance he calls \\"dust\\" which contains the essence of human self-awareness. He also correlates original sin and the human condition to man's first exposure to dust. Metaphorically, dust came into the Garden of Eden and man became self-aware. In his stories the Church is obsessed with destroying dust so that humankind can return to there pre-awareness state of ignorance (ignorance is bliss?). The over-arching conflict in the whole trilogy is the battle of wisdom against ignorance. For those who know anything about Christian theology, it immediately becomes obvious that Pullman is being somewhat disingenuous in his attack. If he really wanted to go after Christianity, he'd deal with substantive Christian precepts, not his philosophical conjecture that the Church yearns for Eden before the serpent. I almost get the feeling Pullman went to parochial school and got his knuckles rapped one too many times by a particularly gloomy nun.    Pullman has created a vibrant \\"metaverse\\" in his trilogy. It's a world where an infinite number of universes exist side-by-side. A \\"subtle knife\\" was constructed that allows the bearer to cut holes in the fabric of these universes and move from one to the other. In the third book, The Amber Spyglass, he introduces us to the lamest of his worlds - his vision of an Eden in distress. The heroine of the trilogy, Lyra, saves the metaverse from falling back into ignorance and despair by re-enacting the role of Eve and the temptation. She simultaneously comes of age, attracts dust, falls in love with a boy who also comes of age, they fall together and love conquers all.    Many people have criticized the trilogy because \\"they kill God in the end\\". Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, this is where Pullman really does Christianity a favor. The worlds of his metaverse are filled with creation's wonder. Lyra is granted, by grace, abilities she wouldn't have otherwise. There is an intelligent and loving essence that pervades everything. In a nut-shell, very God-like. This triumphs in the end. There are two entities that don't survive:  (1)The first angel who evolved from creation who fraudulently claimed he was God. He was ancient and kept captive by his evil lieutenant who was ruling the \\"Church\\" in his name. He is released from his bondage and misery and gratefully disperses into the world and becomes one with the whole.   (2) The evil lieutenant who displays many all-too-human characteristics such as a lust for power, hatred and lechery (the last being his undoing). He is killed by the parents of Lyra who sacrifice their lives in the process.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This has one of the best stories and presentations of all of Miyazakis films if you can stand the environmental catastrophe line that is so common in SciFi these days. Say, if there's such catastrophe coming why is everyone living better than ever? The characters are interesting, the dubbing is well done, the artwork as with all Miyazaki films is better than first rate.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|You will love this dvd/cd.  It is great to hear my music, and see the show.  This is a must have!
B00005JLEU|5.0|It would be difficult to find a better example of anime. The story is nearly complete, the artwork interesting, the dubbing is well done, and the entire presentation is superior. This has to be the anime to which all others are compared.
0439882826|5.0|This is the best pop up book I have seen sence I was in kindergarden! Its fun and I just love that the lightsabers really light up at the end of the book. It also tells a lot of facts from the movies and has very intriguet pop upness....I also like how on one page there are some pop ups in pop ups, and even a smaller pop up in that!! Its really cool, and I recomend this for any starwars fan.
B00003CXBK|5.0|All of Miyazaki's films are good. As a rule the worst are better than the best you get from other producers. This is one of the better films from the master and I recommend it.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This has to be a sleeper movie, it's REALLY nice, low key, not the standard Hollywood blockbuster presentation.  Seems more European in how they filmed it.    Almost peed my pants when Robert Deniro did the Can Can with the dress!    The movie got little advertising when it hit the theaters, but I'm glad I went, loved it enough to get the DVD.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|Loved being able to get the series all in one package.  My son was amazed to get all of them.
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|Good flick, liked the extras at the end too, though they could have added more stuff in there about the behind the scenes filming other than the chases (they focused on chase scenes almost exclusively).    Downside--and I really disliked this--whoever picked the image for the cover of the case did a lousy job, it's washed out, looks like one of those paperback books from the 1960's that's sat in the sun so long all color faded out to neutral blue.  What happened with 'full color' on the covers?  What they put on makes it look old and tired.  Thumbs down on that--hate the cover!    But the movie itself was great.
B00005M91K|5.0|If you don`t believe in my title? - you must see it!<br />Masterpiece of documentary movie. Very beautiful pictures and music.<br />Highest state of recommendation and very special personal reference!<br />Best regards from Poland!<br />Miro

B000I5XOVE|4.0|Overall, a good movie; however the visual clarity was somewhat mixed.    I have a 46\\" Sharp LCD paired with a PS3 via HDMI, other movies look excellent, little to no visual artifacts (Planet Earth, The Christmas Story, Oceans 13, Casino Royale, 5th Element, etc); however it was very clear in the opening scenes that it was pretty much just an upscale, not a native remaster.    Overall, I didn't have it already, so now I do, but some scenes were cleaner than others (ie: the infamous Mel and the girl getting shot at in their trainer; clearly remasterd, very clean)    I give it a 4 star since it looks better than when I saw it in the theatre
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|This is one of Donna Summers \\"Greatest Hits\\" collections that should not be overlooked.Not only is it one of the most complete ever released but the remastering alone is worth every cent.The sound is Amazing!!!,so much so that it sounds as if these songs were originally released today!.The only thing that I did not like is that they took out \\"Dont cry for me Argentina\\" which was included in the Donna Summer Anthology to put \\"Dinner with Gershwin\\" which to me has little or no relevance in this compilation.Now the pros are they included the 7inch version of \\"When Love Cries\\" which is beautiful and much better than the original and the last track \\"Youre so Beautiful\\"which I had not heard of until now which to me is pretty cool and I love the beat!.Having all that said go ahead and buy it!,you wont repent.If youre a huge fan of Donna Summer and like to collect her recordings I would also reccommend a few other wonderful Greatest Hits compilations \\"On the Radio\\"(because the songs are mixed together and the music is nonstop!)and \\"The Donna Summer Anthology\\"(Because it has some beautiful songs that are not included in here).\\"The Journey\\"also deserves honorable mention because its a 2 disc set,number 1 includung her more popular recordings and two cool new songs \\"Thats the Way\\" and \\"I will live for Love\\"and # 2 including 12''versions of some of her hits.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A world-class briefing on a problem sure to haunt, this excellent documentary shows that reality is more compelling than fiction.  Scary!!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a great series, however I just discovered that the 4th disc in my set is a standard DVD disc instead of the Blu-Ray disc!  The set was shrink-wrapped and looked new when I got it, so this could be a manufacturing error.  So make sure you check all of your discs for the Blu-Ray logo!    On the plus side, I did get to see some of the content that the high def. versions are missing because of this slip-up (I can't understand why this extra content was removed from the HD-DVD / Blu-Ray versions)...    Anyway, just wanted to warn people that it's possible that some copies of the set may have the wrong discs.

0740748475|5.0|this was a gift for my boyfriend and he is sooo excited about havig this collection.  He has all the calvin and hobbes books, and even so he thinks its totally worth the money to have the complete set in one case.  He hasnt stopped reading it since I gave it to him two weeks ago.
0143038419|3.0|fascinating writer..I'm half way through the book and intrigued to finish, but not totally sure how I will be affected when I reach the last page.
0740748475|5.0|What a treat to have this set. Having enjoyed \\"Calvin & Hobbes\\" for years, and sad to see the strip end, I didn't hesitate to purchase this complete collection. Reading Watterson's brief autobiography was interesting; it gives a bit of insight on his creativity with the strip, and explains/reiterates his stance on his no-merchandising policy.    The books are heavy, which makes getting them out of the fabric-wrapped cardboard slipcase a minor challenge. The comics are printed on thick paper, making the pages easy to turn. As another reviewer has said, this is really an archival collection and not for constant reading. It's too nicely done to subject it to much wear and tear. I'll probably read the set a couple of times, then leave it on the shelf to enjoy from time to time over the years. My children can enjoy the partial collections I have in paperback, not this particular set!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The Planet Earth DVDs made a great Christmas, or anytime, gift this year.  The series is so beautifully done and is a wonderful education for all ages, especially anyone curious about our world. Fine for young folks of 5+ as well. We especially liked the \\"diaries\\" at the end of each disk that gave insight into the difficulties of filming each section.
B00006L90T|3.0|Carnival of Souls is a haunting story of someone caught between life and the afterlife. Obviously made on a shoestring budget and in black and white, Carnival of Souls uses simple, perhaps cliched, techniques to indicate moments of disorder or dissonance. Nonetheless, they work.    The Alpha Video version is generally good but has one or two glitches in transfer. A more glaring omission -- conspicuously cut out -- is a scene after Mary Henry first plays the organ and factory workers are going to make some comments. Omitted in Alpha version, but retained in Criterion version. No extras in Alpha version. If you can convince your spouse on the expense, get the Criterion version.

B000YPUF9W|4.0|Milla Jovovich returns to her role of Alice in RESIDENT EVIL:  EXTINCTION, and she's brought a lot of kick-butt skills with her.  This is the third outing in the movie franchise.  As players of the game know, Alice was never part of the video games.  She was created wholly for the theater crowd.  However, Alice has been paired up with characters featured in the video games.<br /><br />This time Alice co-stars with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) from the video games as well as Claire Redfield (HEROES' Ali Larter).  Both \\"game\\" characters are given a large share of the screen time.  The villain, Albert Wesker, is also from the games.<br /><br />I pushed the DVD in with no real expectations other than to have a rollicking good time with special effects, martial arts, gunplay, and mindless violence.  You just don't walk into one of these films wanting any kind of serious message.  There are no serious messages in the games, unless you count, \\"Don't get bitten by zombies.\\"<br /><br />I had a great time with the film.  The action started out early and maintained terrific forward momentum.  Some of the characters lived and some of them died, which I expected.  And some of them even died that I truly didn't expect.<br /><br />Jovovich's martial arts sequences are some of the best she's ever done.  Ali Larter was outstanding as the leader of a convoy of survivors she was trying to take to safety.  There's not a lot of character to put on display in a film like this, and everyone connected to the production wisely allowed the violence and special effects take the lead.<br /><br />One of the best - and most chilling parts of the film - was the opening.  I watched breathlessly as Alice awakes and tries to get out of some kind of institution.  She barely escapes death trap after death trap and ends up (surprise!) getting killed.  Then our villain orders her body dumped and we see her corpse get thrown into a trench outside the facility.  The trench is filled with other dead \\"Alices\\" and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand they're clones.<br /><br />The facility is an underground complex.  The visual representation showing that facility is one of the movie's coolest graphics.  I also loved the way the zombies were kept outside of the aboveground facility by a tall fence.  But the image jarred me a lot too because it's too much like comics scribe Robert Kirkman's zombie title THE WALKING DEAD.<br /><br />The action shifts over to the real Alice and she's immediately in danger from survivors who try to kill her.  I was a little troubled by the fact that the killers didn't seem to be properly motivated, but when they set the zombie dogs on Alice to kill her, I promptly pushed that out of my mind and simply enjoyed the action sequences.<br /><br />The zombie crows later in the film were terrifying.  Kind of like Alfred Hitchcock's THE BIRDS on steroids.  The huge cloud of them attacking the convoy was totally amazing visually, as was Alice's attack on them with the mind-controlled fireblast spewed by the flamethrower.<br /><br />RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION got an R rating, but there wasn't a single F-bomb I remember hearing, nor any other egregious language.  The rating seems to be totally derived from the violence and the appearance of the zombies.  Personally, I think a PG-13 rating would have sufficed.  You can freely watch this one with your older kids.  I watched it with my ten year old and he had a good time with it.<br /><br />The Resident Evil video game franchise continues to pump out new entries.  EXTINCTION is rumored to be the last live-action movie, but I hope that's not true.  A motion-capture film called, for the moment, RESIDENT EVIL:  DEGENERATION is already in the works.<br /><br />The two-disc set and Blu-ray edition carries a lot of extras that fans will want to have.  The audio commentary, the making-of featurette, and the sneak peek at RESIDENT EVIL:  DEGENERATION are all worth making time for.to understand they're clones.

0439813786|4.0|My mother gave me this book as a gift for Xmas and it has just been released in Italy. I hope that the success will be huge also here. Italian translation is excellent.<br />I don't want to write too much and to tell what's inside the book. I think that everyone should read it, as every details of the book is worth seeing and it's such a beautiful object to have. The illustrations are amazing, in black and white, and the plot keeps you reading all the time, I finished in three days and I was hooked as I was in The Da Vinci Code and the atmosphere reminded me of the great book Emile and the detectives by Emile Kastner, which was my favourite book when I was a child.<br />I saw a Selzinck's interview before reading the book and I was thinking that the danger was that all the research made by Mr Selznick for Hugo Cabret could make the book too cold, but this luckily doesn't happened. I do really appreciated this invention. It's a very nice book.

0763631205|5.0|[[ASIN:0763631205 A Christmas Carol]]    It was my goal this December to read to my children, ages seven, nine and 14, the Christmas Carol story by Dickens so that they would know the original before seeing the movie.  I also thought this would be an accessible way for them to get oriented to English literature and prepare them for further reading.      The requirements of the Christmas Carol book to be purchased were that a) it be new as opposed to a ragged used copy, b) it be unabridged, c) it have good drawings; and d) if possible it be inexpensive.  I first looked in the library, but their book was checked out, and anyway I was looking to start a family tradition of reading the story every year with our own copy if possible.  The Candlewick Press edition with illustrations by P.J. Lynch appeared to fill the bill; I bought it; and it delivered the goods.  The book is nice and readable-sized, the illustrations good, the type pleasing.  Thirteen bucks.  I was immensely satisfied with the purchase.      As to the fate of the reading, we handled one chapter per evening, there being five chapters; each took an hour or so to read.  I found Dickens to be sometimes heavy going for the younger TV and video-generation kids to get a sense of what is going on.  I did not recollect Dickens to be so when I read some of his works as a younger person, but apparently it's something you have to be exposed to and get to understand.  Anyway I was happy to provide my children with the chance to get started.  It gave me a measure of the gap between the reading preparation of today's youth versus my pre-Cambrian elementary and middle school days.  On Christmas Day I showed them the George C. Scott version of the movie, and they all liked it.  But all knew the basics from the book, which was my goal, even if the mid-1800s prose obscured many of the action points to the younger ones in their Sponge Bob and Hannah Montana mindsets.    So the effort was a success, and this edition of the book did what I had hoped by delivering up an excellent presentation at a very low cost.    Dan of Arlington

I will say this AT FIRST I couldn't stand her I thought she was another blonde hair bimbo but when this album came out I realized she was not only intelligent, but has depth.    I think people misjudge her as being a Diva when in reality she was abused as a child and had a rough life so they mistake security with being cold. It could have been so easy for her to become another Britany BUT she didn't. She is underated.     Every song on this album has it's own little story and it's an album with meaning. In a world with rehab celebs and an heiress becoming little an idol for little girls people underestimate Christina Aguilera. Everyone judges her and look at her now married and having a child the right way. She seems more mature than her peers and has incredible talent. I can't say enough good things about her she is always doing what she feels is right and doesn't care what others think about her. Ok I could go on all day but the bottom line is:    \\"With a voice like that you should be considered a legend in the making.\\"
0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for my 5-year-old son for Christmas.  It contains 6 pop-up filled spreads.  All of the pages contain 1 large pop-up and several smaller pop-ups on the sides.  Some of them even open and then open again to reveal more pop-ups!  On the final page the pop-ups of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker have tiny light sabers that really light up.  My son is thrilled with his book and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I would highly recommend this book for the Star Wars lover in your family.
B000G759LW|5.0|She does what she wants and sings what she wants. She doesn't try to be anything but herself:     \\"I don't stop to please someone elses needs I'm gonna live my life for me....\\" - Aguilera (Here to Stay)    There's no denying her voice everyone knows she's gifted. Does she oversing at times maybe but we all know she can sing Beautiful or in her earlier days I turn to you with purity and grace. I don't understand people; people say she tries to be like Mariah and when she broke out of the bubble gum songs everyone said she's yelling? People will never be happy, but the bottom line is she can sing.    Is the album good YES. I like Stripped better I found it inspiring with a touch of soul but none the less with songs like Iv'e Got Trouble and Makes Me Wanna Pray she will always be here to stay.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|I have not yet seen this movie but based on what I know it should be really good.<br />It was received in good order and I am happy with my purchase!<br />Thank you for making a \\"pre release\\" order available.
0593057007|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher read.  Starting with a unique killing and with a suspense filled ending, you will never be bored.  Great characters and the usual big hearted Reacher settling his debts.
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes is the quintessential book on understanding boys.  Never have I had a comic that I can relate to with imagination and character more than Calvin and Hobbes.  I remember being a young kid and eagerly awaiting the opportunity to steal the comic pages from the paper from Dad to read what my little ADD friend and his tiger were up to.  They provided countless hours of insight and joy to my childhood and being able to revisit them in my older age is a real treat.  This collection is very nice and a very attractive set to add to your book collection.  I look forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to appreciate them.
B000EWBKKI|1.0|This movie has been one of my favorites. I owned it on laser disc in the early 90's.  It looked superb and sharp on my 32\\" TV. Turns out maybe the reason it looked so crisp back then was because 450 lines of resolution was about the limit of what could be seen.<br /><br />When I rented it on Blu-ray and played it, I couldn't believe my eyes.  It appears that it was not filmed on the highest quality film stock.  It looks slightly soft at times and just plain undefined.  Not razor sharp and prestine.  The opening nighttime battle scene is one example. The T-1000's arrival under the bridge is another, and Arnold's arrival next to the big rig trucks is yet another example. Yet the daytime scenes in sunlight some look a bit better.  That includes the scene with the two kids going to the bank's ATM.<br /><br />INTERESTING DVD COMPARISON - I have the same movie on DVD.  I played it in the Blu-ray player which upconverted it.  It looks ALMOST the same as the HD version. This movie is only slightly better in HD at best. I've seen older movies than this one that look  much more detailed.<br /><br />The best part about this disc is the redesigned main menu graphics and the updated 2003 commentary featuring the director. THAT'S IT.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you want to see what Blu-ray can do, this movie is NOT the one to get.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/2011: I newer version of the movie called the \\"Skynet Edition\\" was released on Blu-ray in 2009.  It's much better than the original 2006 Blu-ray and higher quality than a upscaled DVD.  Not razor-edge sharp but very clean and crisp.
B000JLTR8G|4.0|Excellent story... the characters are believable and the movie has a twist that will break your heart. The actors became the characters. They bring you to Japan and they're way of thinking. The HONOR among the Japanese can be a little overwhelming to the American mind. DEEP!!!
0670034711|5.0|I got this for my daughter for Christmas. When she came home she told me she absolutely loves the book. She is more than halfway through it.She said it was so her.
B000TEUSJU|5.0|Oh geez, where to begin?  It is certainly as gaudy as Cleopatra, but much much smuttier. But who are you kidding? If you want Caligula, it's not for the attention to historic detail.  To be honest, I'm still stuck on the firast disc, I haven't yet plumbed the depths of special features and whatnot.  But I can say that this has to be one of the most intriguing pieces I've seen in my short life.  And I am waiting for the 2008 remake- because that will seal the envelope and tuck it in a corner, rather than rip it to shreds...
B000YMBBH0|5.0|Great movies, and even better picture and sound. This HD DVD set is well worth the price. Recommended.
0679411585|5.0|I admit I am a war movie buff. I bought the book after watching the movie version several times.  I knew the book should be more detailed and it is!  Great read.
B0000026NC|5.0|As with any Pink Floyd connoisseur I shied away from the live recroded albums. This one change my mind at least when it comes to Pink Floyd. This is not my first copy of Delicate Sound of Thunder, the first one worn out so there was a need for the replacement.   If you are just getting started into Pink Floyd I would suggest Dark Side of The Moon as the starter album.   For a group which has had no number 1 hits Pink Floyd does have a lot of staying power.
0740748475|5.0|I have been waiting for this to come down in price and when it did i jumped on it.  i am a huge fan and to ahve all the comics in this collection it is great!
0609610570|5.0|Promptly answered all pre-purchase emails.  Prompt delivery after the sale.  No hesitation in using again.
0439882826|5.0|I watched an interview of the artists about the making of this book and I ran to my computer to buy it for my grandson for Christmas.  Amazon by far, had the best price.  My 8 year old grandson is so excited about this book and he wrote me a thank you letter telling me that it even has sound effects!  Thanks Amazon!    Great workmanship, great price, great product.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|An excellent movie, though you MUST read the book to fully appreciate the hours and years of work involved to outlaw slavery in England and the amazing character and influence of the man, William Wilberforce, upon history.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|this movie was as good as the rest of the bourne movies.  if you liked them, you will like this one just as much.
0609610570|5.0|After delivering all the stuff on execution/people management/expectations/planning etc., Bossidy delivered a time-frame for getting things done - 25 hours a week - outside of which you're just doing busy work as a CEO; this was of a great deal of value to me.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|This is the best Jamaican movies ever. I can watch this movie a million times and never get bored. A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
0529064847|5.0|I wanted to get a bible for my daughter that would be interesting and at the same time easy to read and not difficult to understand.I believe The New American Bible is all that plus at a great bargain price.
B000UPDSTA|5.0|As long as this book has been around I was surprised to see there were no reader's reviews.  If you are a UFO buff, and like me are always looking for a smoking gun like the MJ-12 documents, you have to read this book.<br /><br />Unfortunately the book's author, Philip Corso is deceased, but over ten years ago he was interviewed on at least one occasion that I recall by Art Bell on Coast to Coast AM which resulted in me purchasing the book shortly after it was originally published.  I have read the book twice as well as much about the book which as been written in other books, both pro and con, and there are some things related in the book which are obviously not true and easily proven.  On the other hand Corso was an old man when the book was written; the book was coauthored by William J. Birnes, and Corso himself said just prior to his death that he wished he had done a better job editing what Birnes had written.<br /><br />If only 20% of this book is true it's still fantastic.  Corso claims to have been involved, while serving as an officer in the United States Air Force at the Pentagon, in the introduction of alien technology, recovered from the Roswell crash, into American industry which resulted in things like the integrated circuit, fiber optics, night vision, and Kevlar.  Critics point to inaccuracies in the accounts, but there have never been any charges of hoax or lies from the Air Force or industry as a result of claims made in the book, and with Corso literally on his death bed when he wrote this his only book, he had no reason to make all this stuff up.  Most of the people and places discussed in the book are verifiable as other books have pointed out, and I am inclined to believe that parts if not all of the book are based in fact and that the events described did take place.<br /><br />If you are curious about the UFO phenomenon this is a book that you want to believe.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|If you're complaining that some of your equipments are heavy and bulky enough you should buy this its perfect for just any occasion it can fit on your pocket, you cant believe how each AA battery loads will give you more shots its just amazing, i haven't change the battery on this since i bought it and still shooting and flashing even in cold winter season, its kinda rugged too cause my son have drop this so many times and still working...i would recommend this product besides its not heavy on your wallet.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  It fires on all cylinders - great story, great characters, great cenimatography (Okay ..CGI does have an edge). You should not be disapointed.
B000XFCPHI|5.0|I ACTUALLY GREW UP WATCHING THIS MOVIE AND TO THIS DAY STILL OWN IT. THE MOST MEMORABLE SCENES WERE ALWAYS THE ONES WITH THE SONGS. THE TUNES WERE ALWAYS SO CATCHY AND MY LITTLE SISTER AND I WOULD SING THEM ALL THE TIME. IT WASNT TILL RECENTLY DID I FIND THE SOUNDTRACK AND IT TOOK ME RIGHT BACK TO WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH I FOUND A LONG LOST LOVE. I LOVE MUSIC SO LISTENING TO THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF MUSIC REALLY SOOTHES ME AND I SHARE IT WITH OTHERS AND IT SO HAPPENS THEY GET HOOKED AS WELL!
B000IJ79WU|5.0|I am 100% satisfied with this item. Richard Donner's version does indeed  show the missing links cut from the alternate Richard Lester's edition.  It has more indepth knowledge for the average fan continued from the first  movie. We all would like to know how the three villians escaped from the  Phantom Zone. And, now the truth comes out here. Superman (Kal-EL) and his  father (Jor-EL) both discussing their opinions were quite memorable.       Highly recommend !
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I've done many prenatal workout videos and this one is just wonderful.  It's a challenging workout and is not mundane, as some of the pregnancy workout videos can be.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|If you have Both a HD DVD Player and A HD TV this set is a must have to add to your DVD Collection!!!!  Universal Studios did a Bang-up job putting these films in a much higher resolution.........    Must have  10/10
B000W4HJ44|1.0|I was very disappointed in the quality of this film.  I was expecting a humorous recap of the 50' - 60's.  I felt the weight issue was over blown, and other points were extremly exaterated.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Hugo Weaving gives an excellent performance as \\"V\\" and Natalie Portman also stars in this 2006 film about a futuristic London. A portrait of a Brave New World/1984 society in which the government, led by dictator Adam Sutler (masterfully played by John Hurt), attempts to control everything, this film is a warning of what could become of tightening civil liberties and increasing government control here in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture highlights the dramatic cinematic sequence at the end.
1563898586|4.0|I liked Watchmen, so I ordered TLoEG Vol 1 and 2 for my 10 year old son for Christmas.  Thankfully, I started reading it before he did as it is very much an adult themed graphic novel, with a couple of rape scenes in the first half of Vol 1 alone.  I haven't finished the book yet - just wanted to give a head's up to other parents out there before they made the same mistake I did.  With Captain Nemo, et al. it never occurred to me that it would lean in this direction.  Fine for me, just NOT AT ALL APPROPRIATE for preteens.
0786838655|4.0|This book is full of action. I can't wait to read the next two books!!!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|Best purchase ever!  Storage box is very neat and looks like the box on the show.  Its magnetic top holds together fairly well.  The Q & A book inside is also neat, but don't read it until you've watched the entire 5 seasons- it contains spoilers.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Its just what my mom wanted for the holidays!  Great gift!  She loves it.
0385504209|1.0|I dont see anything interesting about this book nor the movie. This book is one reason why I only read fact.  Just way to out of wack
B00006CXSS|5.0|I finally bought this set for my husband this Christmas. It's one of those miniseries that we watch any time it's on the History Channel.  We rarely watch movies more than a few times, but we feel different about the Band of Brothers.  It is the best miniseries of our time. Sincerely, Susana.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|What an excellent collection of music from series 2! I would recommend this to any Dr Who fan or music lover alike!
B000002MZ9|4.0|I was shocked the first time I heard this, and wondered if I could listen to it again. I'd been away from hard rock for many years, and didn't know anything at all about Pearl Jam. But I hung in there, and after the third listening I was hooked. I think the first and last cuts are weak, but everything in between is sensational. Several numbers sound like they could have been done by the Stones. Listen to it on a good system. It's amazing that the guy who did Prairie Wind and Harvest Moon also did this. But then, there is only Neil Young and Bob Dylan. They are the only ones from the 60s who never stopped growing, exploring, and creating.
B000IU3XU6|1.0|I was very disappointed after receiving the CD/DVD set from George Groban / AWAKE for a price of $ 24.99. The DVD is not the DVD I was expecting, it was just a behind the scene of making the Music Video DVD and NOT the MUSIC VIDEO itself! Amazon should have inform this to the buyers with the sale of the CD/DVD on the web.
0143038419|5.0|Read the book in less than a week. Page turner, I couldn't put it down. You feel like you're with her on the year long journey she takes!! I highly recommend this book!!
B000I5YCCO|4.0|I think that the cd is fantanstic. This young girl has some real talent and my daughter absolutely loves her!! It was a great Christmas buy.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|My son asked for this movie for Christmas.  The shipping was extremely fast (did not pay for faster shipping).  It came in perfect shape and it works great.    It is a very good movie and we saw it in the theater when it came out.  It is very well done.
B00005RYL2|5.0|Well this was for my husband, who loves this movie, he says because of the original story.  \\"some guy just made all this up\\"...lol but it's a good quality dvd and a good movie to have.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is an absolute delight. Ok, it helps that I'm a Francophiile and love fine food but even if you hate the French and consider the Cheesecake Factory haute cuisine, you'll like Ratatouille. The dish is quite good as well.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|I got this for my daughter for xmas.  She loves Avril.  I think it's a pretty good album.  She has some new sounds from her last so that's nice.  I didn't realize the parental warning...lol...well it is pretty bad for a five year old.  Unless you want your lil ones talkin like sailors.  lol Other than that great!
B00004RF98|5.0|In my opinion this is the greatest of all MGM musicals and a strong candidate for the best ever from any source.It has great songs ,a stellar cast at peak form ,quite exceptional dance routines and a story that is warm ,nostalgic and witty .This is in addition to direction of the highest quality ,displaying great panache and brio ,from joint directors Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly .The direction perfectly reflects the speed crazy era of its setting -the Roaring Twenties.  Screenwriters Adolph Green and Betty Conden  were asked to devise a musical that would draw upon some of the best tunes (many written by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown)from the MGM output of previous decades .They found that many of these were from movies made in the transitional era between silent cinema and the conversion to sound and decided they would focus their story on that volatile period in Hollywood history when careers rose and fell overnight and new faces replaced established favourites .  It opens in 1927 Hollywood when romantic and dashing lead actor Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly)and blonde bombshell Lina Lamont (Jean hagen)are the major romatic coupling in movies .Lina mistakenly believes their on screen romance is for real.Don and his lesser known partner Cosmo Brown(Donald O'Connor)have paid their dues having risen through vaudeville and stunt work to their present position and are adequately prepared for the arrival of the sound era .Not so Lina whose corncrake voice and Brooklyn accent are wrong for her image and roles ,despite the best endeavours of a voice coach(whose prissy and pompous style are mocked by Cosmo and Don in their brilliant routine to \\"Moses Supposes\\")Enter kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds )an aspiring \\"serious\\"actress with whom Don falls in love and who eventually dubs  Lina's  voice in the movies before things progress to a happy ending in which true love reigns supreme.    This movie has some of the very best choreography ever put on screen and more than anyone Kelly is responsible for the ambience of the movie and its spectacular qualities.I would cite as an example his tour de force rendition of the title song which alone makes this a must see picture .It is a wonderful secular hymn to the joys of being in love ,and joyous though it is it is run close by the energetic O'Connor routine \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\"and the dazzling \\"Broadway Ballet\\"as danced by Cyd Charisse.    It is a clever movie and it also beautifully evokes the excitement,pleasure and sheer hard work of making movies .The script is indeed fact based and many of the incidents featured in it actually happened .One aspect which -for me -has been unjustly overlooked is the wonderful Jean Hagen performance as Lina -a woman who may have vocal issues but is no dumb blonde and knows her way around a contract.This is a little gem of a  comedic performance -touching ,funny and vulnerable.Kelly ,O'Connor and Reynolds are splendid-Reynolds was always at her best when playing people whose energy levels were as substantial as herv own  -as per The Unsinkable Molly Brown and this movie.    Its a joy -an unalloyed joy .Please see this movie even if musicals are not normally your thing
1594489505|2.0|Our book group of nine read this book and our collective feeling was one of disappointment.  A few of the comments included the following:  If it hadn't been about Afghanistan, it wouldn't have been published.    Predictable.  Unnecessary dramatic twists.  Maybe a best seller, but not a best book. The ending was like a soap opera.
0143038419|4.0|Well written!  I could feel the author's pain, frustration,loneliness, and other emotions, in her search for \\"being.\\"
1582701709|4.0|people who've watched this book would feel either \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\".  why there is such a contrast in the rating?  I think what's told in this book is real, it is just missing some scientific supports which we always rely on first, before accepting and believing a new theory to be \\"real\\".  Many people becomes angry or feels like being cheated buying the book after watching the line --  \\"If you want to be rich, just think to be rich and u will be rich\\", Without showing any solid evidence in the book, who is going to believe that?  I suggest people who want to watch this book should first backup themselves with some concept and theories about what consciousness is.  Once you understand what it is first and give practice to what this book told about the secret, I'm sure you will be amazed.  Just as stated in the book,the old group of leaders, politicians and priests are concern about the change of the world, the change of the mind and thoughts of the new generation. Some of them are like what's told in the book, they know the secret, and they realize once more and more people learn about the secret, their whatever power would start to be weakened.  In the coming future, our view to this world is going to change, we will notice that our mind is not living in our body, it is our body living in one big mind.many of us will perceive this \\"consciousness\\" as even science now, is trying to prove the existence of it .   If you search keywords of \\"consciousness\\", \\"Psi\\", \\"Zero point field\\",\\"Quantum entanglement\\" , u will find thousand of related books talking about it, and there will be more to come.
B00008MZ0N|5.0|Gives a bad name and reputation to all real tuners and racers.  So stupid it is comical.
B000VECAEO|5.0|It is so sad that it is over.  I have all the seinfeld episodes and I love them all, this one is no different.  This is a must have if you are a Seinfeld lover and if you haven't watched it, well you don't know what your missing.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|This is one of the best buys I have ever made, 3 BR discs and 2 dvds and a whole host of extras for under 70 bucks.  The transfers of BR are astounding, and the special which is 3 1/2 hours is the finest docum ever made.  The deleted section almost one hour held my breath as clip after clip came by..I never dreamed that these existed.  A great companion to this movie is the new 3disc soundtrack with one disc of all new music for the 25 anniversity...it is just great and I think its only on amazon, check it out...my highest possible recommendation...get it...
1594489505|5.0|When I heard that the author of The Kite Runner had a new book out, I immediately put A Thousand Splendid Suns on my Christmas wish list, anticipating a spellbinding new story. I finished this novel in a day, speechless. As brilliantly as Hosseini created this story of Mariam and Laila, what haunted me days afterwards was the fact that this was a call to awareness. Hosseini writes of a culture that most Americans know little to nothing about, illustrating the horrific decimation of a country through two characters with whom the reader bonds. When I flipped the back cover to read the reviews, it was almost appalling to read what a \\"great story\\" it was, or that it was an excellent story about \\"women and their friendships.\\" To me, it was more than a story. It was a way for Hosseini, in the form of a masterpiece, to call our attention to something that seriously cannot go on ignored anymore.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|one of the best buys and certainly the best CD set of 2007, the third disc with all new material was amazing especially songs one and two and seven...wow. I remember at the time the blade runner soundtrack was far far ahead of its time, thats why it still stand up today, but the new music for the 25th ann takes it to a new level...and 25 years from now it will hold up, sort of techo rap with classical themes going thru..amazing, I just cannot recommend this any higher...a must buy and 3 cds with some of the greatest film music EVER...get it NOW
159562015X|4.0|helps a person focus their energy on what comes natural to them.  very motivating.
0143038419|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is 'searching' for answers in their life in all areas. She does a great job at using her story to impact the reader.
B000UGG3A0|4.0|I've heard the DKM for a long time and haven't purchased a CD until now. \\"Meanest of Times\\" is a rocked-out punk version of Celtic music that honestly is a fun listen--if you like your Celtic loud and proud.     Generally speaking, the Pogues and Great Big Sea are the most rocked-out Celtic music I like.  I bought \\"Meanest of Times\\" for \\"(F)Lannigan's Ball\\" and \\"Johnny, I Hardly Knew You.\\"  Both are my favorites in the collection--and yes, both are a bit more Celtic than punk.
B000003CMB|5.0|I listen mainly to indie rock/pop, but this is probably one of my top 20 favorite albums ever, and probably one of my top 5 favorite live albums ever. The guitar playing is beyond beautiful. The first time I heard this version of \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\", I nearly cried. This album contains some of the most expressive, sincere, and moving guitar playing I have ever heard. This album is definitely more of an \\"experience\\" than most live albums you've heard.
B000P12LWY|3.0|Casting could have been better here, as could some of the acting.  The music is nothing great either, and I don't care much for the fellow playing Henry.  The first season drags out all the business with Anne Boleyn, Catherine of Aragon, and Thomas Wolsey, also.  The costumes and locations are wonderful, and there is some entertainment to be had.  Apparently the history is inaccurate, though I can't really comment on that since I am not that familiar with the era and people involved.     Okay for a cheap rental, but nobody needs to purchase this.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|So glad that they finally brought this out on DVD.  I have to admit that I bought this movie for my husband, he loves the bear necessities of life!  And the kids love it too!  Great movie!!
B000TSIK14|5.0|Not since perhaps their last CD has there been a band who's stayed SO true to their 'sound' without selling out or going commercial.  This project is REAL SCORPIONS - heart-wrenching ballads with clever multi-layered lyrics that can be interpreted any way you wish.  Tight music and harmonies that PROVE again that those with true talent will rock on with a semi-original member band after about 30 years....Mind blowing riffs, art in the form of solos and orchestration.  Boundless energy, creative minds collaborated again to bring it all home at no risk of offending anyone.  Their most loyal fan/friend, ENJOY ALL!
B000SO7OMA|4.0|Loreena is one of those rarest of birds in today's entertainment industry. She can sing (obviously), writes great lyrics and can play several instruments. She has talent. She's like Enya with a brain.    But as I was watching the DVD, it seemed there was a couple things that were unsettling. First off, I thought the electric guitar and some of the \\"rock\\" drumming seemed out of place. A little too over bearing. I mean this is not supposed to be AC-DC.     I also thought a horrible job was done on the mixing. You see people playing and you strain your ear to find their notes but you hear nothing.  There's a song that has a harp intro and then Loreena sings. As soon as the singing starts, the harp basically disappears. It seems pretty apparent to me the mixing was done to actentuate the singing at the expense of the instumentalists. I give the DVD 4 stars based on the poor quality of the sound mix. The mix should have been a little more balanced.    The audience was not much of a factor either. I like to see the audience interaction but European audiences tend to sit there like graveyard statues so there probably wasn't much point.     Outside the scope of the DVD, I think Loreena could add another dimension to her music by adding additional singers. Perhaps for another time?
0345451325|2.0|After playing through the Halo video game trilogy, I found myself wanting more...more of the action, more of the atmosphere, more of the suspense...more of everything that made the game trilogy so great. I then discovered the series of Halo novels and purchased Eric Nylund's prequel to Halo: Combat Evolved. Unfortunately, I found that, on the whole, Nylund's book failed to effectively deliver any of the aforementioned qualities.     The first and largest problem, is that Nylund's version of the protagonist, Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, is completely unlike the character I grew to love in the video game trilogy. Though he was a man of few words on the XBOX and XBOX 360, he was still effectively portrayed by Bungie Studios as a determined, fiery and most of all, noble and sympathetic warrior. Nylund's portrayal reduces him to a brutal, emotionless, computer-like drone who merely follows orders and wants nothing other than to accomplish his mission. Any attempts that Nylund makes to state otherwise are very unconvincing...it's hard to believe the Master Chief is feeling much regret after very deliberately and savagely beating several of his comrades to death in an exercise room. Worse, the Master Chief is laughably invincible in Nylund's novel. Although the reader is expected to and should suspend his or her disbelief for a sci-fi novel such as this one, there are limits. The Master Chief takes on impossible odds while his comrades are portrayed as helpless, pathetic weaklings that are constantly marching toward certain doom. This makes Master Chief's character not only unbelievable but also wholly unlikeable...there is an air of superiority and arrogance that surrounds Nylund's version of the Master Chief that wasn't present in the video game version.    Other characters, including fan favorites such as Captain Keyes and the artificial intelligence Cortana, are also distorted by Nylund's view of the Halo universe. Portrayed as intelligent, battle-seasoned andtough-as-nails in the games, Nylund's version of Captain Keyes suddenly and inexplicably seems unable to make important battle decisions in the presence of the Master Chief, despite being the first commanding officer to destroy multiple covenant ships with just one UNSC vessel. He also seems to have an unhealthy obsession with military protocol, constantly smoothing out his uniform or thinking about military regulations, which becomes irritating to the reader after a short time. Captain Keyes was anything but an irritating character in the video games. Cortana, sharp and witty in the games, is just annoying in this novel, correcting people unnecessarily and just generally being arrogant. (She actually seems somewhat similar to what I imagined 343 Guilty Spark would be like in a novel at times)    All of these problems are compounded by Nylund's amateurish writing style. He uses short, choppy sentences that break up what little flow the novel has to begin with. At best, he paints an interesting picture of futuristic militaria while at worst he makes the reader feel as if he or she is reading a high school student's research paper. Even leaving aside the many errors in military customs and courtesies (Enlisted members do not typically salute other enlisted members, therefore the Master Chief is not entitled to the salutes he frequently gets--neither Second or First Lieutenants exist in the Navy, etc.) Nylund's writing still feels lazy and unprofessional.    I would only recommend this book to those who absolutely can't do without more Halo. This book adds little to the canon of Halo's story and isn't a very good read. It will likely leave even the most rabid of Halo fans feeling slightly disappointed (even though they probably wouldn't admit it).

0316067598|4.0|This is one of the finest and most engaging stories I have ever read regarding the experience of men in warfare.  The author, a highly trained Navy Seal, gives a detailed description of not only his life and training, but of the full length of experience he went through.  He is very candid and thoughtful with his descriptions of everything and interestingly is at the same time a roughneck Navy Seal and a thoughtful, engaging person.     Granted the author does editorialize some which is why I don't give it five stars, but I am willing to cut him some slack as he survived this harrowing ordeal and he did fight for the right to editorialize if he so chooses. His story of the brutality of the Taliban and the kindness of the people in the village who shelter him are moving and consuming. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an accurate and honest view of the war on terror.
0441008615|1.0|I am not a big fan of Gaiman, who too often misuses such talent as he has.  But perhaps I should blame Pratchett for this mess, because Gaiman, whatever his faults, has never before bored me.  The strained attempts at wacky humor fall so flat it is painful.  The authors often say things they do not mean, and then say (in effect) \\"Ha ha, I lied,\\" and this is supposed to pass for Douglas-Adams-style clever word play.  I can find no trace of the hilarity others perceive, and only once (at the mission of the whale research ship) was I even tempted to smile.<br /><br />Preaching in fiction can be tiresome even when the reader agrees, but here, the authors preach a repulsive message of moral nihilism.  According to these authors, being Evil requires special effort -- a particular fanaticism towards serving Satan and a desire to destroy the World (\\"Evil\\" must be rare, in these authors' views).  But being \\"Good\\" is just as bad because - uh ... \\"Good\\" people are also fanatics who want to destroy the World. (Since when???).  What is the solution?  Just be \\"perfectly poised between heaven and hell, half angel, half demon, all human\\".  Hmmm, how exactly does one \\"be human,\\" I wonder?  Just be a selfish self-absorbed twerp, I guess, like the barely-likeable sympathetic characters of this novel, and all the misery and suffering of the world will magically dissolve.  Since all temptations are by nature \\"human\\", it would seem to follow that there are no temptations a human being ought resist, unless, perhaps, he feels a bizarre alien urge to destroy the World.  It must be reassuring to be told one has no other moral obligations.<br /><br />This has been called a parody of apocalypse literature.  Perhaps I missed the stories spoofed, because I never read an apocalpse story where both the \\"good\\" guys and the \\"bad\\" guys are eager to destroy the World.  In the apocalypse stories I have seen or read (including \\"the Omen\\" and including Revelations itself), Evil wants Power (not Oblivion, per se) and the Good want to resist Evil.  This is not so much a parody as a book-long straw man set up to crumble before the authors rejection of any moral ideals.<br /><br />I would have stopped reading from boredom (my fate whenever I attempt Pratchett), except that I was curious to know why this book was dedicated to G.K. Chesterton.  I never really found out.  One possible connection is that Chesterton wrote a far livelier apocalypse farce called THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY.  That novel, however, was emphatic in its rejection of moral nihilism.  Perhaps the dedication to Chesterton is intentional irony.<br /><br />An acquaintance, seeing me with this book, praised it highly.  When I mentioned that I never yet laughed, he said that he never laughed either, but liked the book because he agreed with its philosophy.  He had earlier expressed a firm belief that there is no such thing as Good or Evil.per se) and the Good want to resist Evil.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Saw this animated film on the 'big screen' in the spring of '07 - now watching my purchased DVD @ the moment - I absolutely adore this film (being a physician, rats don't disturb me, BTW - ;-)) - but, I was curious by the 1* reviews (who would rate this production so low, i.e. virtually meaning 'I hated It!') - well, most of those lowest reviews commented on either a DVD playing issue or an attitude about 'hating' rats (pretty lame to me!) - well, this film overall is already 4+* (if not for those poorly imagined 1* ratings, might have approached 5*) - this is worth a watch!
159102594X|5.0|I'm not going to re-summarize the plot... I'll just throw in my 2 cents:  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  So much so, that I've pre-ordered the 2nd book on Amazon, and pre-ordered the 3rd book on Amazon.co.uk (since it comes out there first).  I must admit that I've had trouble convincing myself to read first-time author books, I usually look for established authors that have proven themselves.  There were so many recommendations for this book in several fantasy lists that I figured I'd give it a shot.  Also, since it's been out in the UK for several months, there's a plethora of positive reviews.    A wonderful read.  Thank you.
0452284392|4.0|Excellent read.  I'm a systems engineer by trade and although the book is by no means technical, it really drove the \\"connectedness\\" topic home for me as the author showed how objects naturally connect and grow in both real and abstract terms.  If this sounds interesting- you will enjoy it too.
0375842381|5.0|I received this set for Christmas, and I read it during the first week of the new year. These are a quick read, but completely enjoyable. I'm not a literary critic, and so many other people have written such wonderful reviews, that I'm not going to compete. These are wonderful books, and any reader young or old that enjoys fantasy will enjoy these books. I hope the case will come in handy when I'm loaning these out to other friends that want to read them. It's a good quality set, and I couldn't be happier.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The remastering work is excellent and has produced stunning picture and sound. The detail in some of the scenes is amazing. Glad to watch this groundbreaking movie in all its Blu-Ray glory!   This five-disc set plays perfectly in the UK (PS3).
B00005JKN9|3.0|This movie was far too long.  The graphic violence was just way over the top. Leo DiCaprio was not the guy for the role.     But Daniel Day Lewis's performance was something special.  It was perhaps the greatest performance I have ever seen.  I cannot fathom how bad this movie would have been without Lewis.    If you are studying acting, watch this film. Lewis will surely inspire you. I don't study acting but the Lewis performance made me want to.    I rate this movie a 3 star.  Every star is solely because of Lewis.
B00103584Y|5.0|I cannot wait to get this on Blu-ray.  I originally saw this flick in a little art-house theater (seated on a folding chair) during grad school and was amazed.  I had it on DVD until I mistakenly loaned it out and never got it back.  I've been holding out hope to see in in HD and can't wait until I do.  I'll be counting the days.  My Denon 2808 is going to make it all the much better.
0143034545|3.0|I read David Allen's first book, Getting Things Done, and thought that his productivity system was great, so I quickly bought Ready for Anything (his second book) to find out what other advice he has to share.<br /><br />There are many useful insights in this book that elaborate on his GTD system and tackle different aspects of productivity. However, the points he makes could easily have been said in a far simpler - and a more structured - way. For most chapters, I can make out the main point from the title and a few sentences towards the end. Everything in between is usually very confusing, and I struggle to link it to the main idea or any experience in my life.<br /><br />The lack of structure and the unnecessary confusion shaved off two stars from my rating. Besides that, I believe David Allen's approach is a great way to approach productivity, and this book can help you understand some of the essentials of his system, and the reasoning behind them.
B000SJHNB2|4.0|Do not let the size fool you. This is a very handy piece of equipment and it's so easy to set up and use. Just plug a 1/4 inch stereo cable into your sub out on your mixer and then into the HA400, then plug in up to 4 pairs of headphones and your set to track overdubs. This is perfect for a small home studio on a budget and it's built like a tank. Be forewarned that this a very basic headphone distribution system, you can only adjust volume from the HA400 and it would be wise to purchase a real long 1/4 stereo cable and extensions for the headphones if you want to isolate vocals.

0316018953|2.0|The Overlook by Michael Connelly is not written as well as his other Harry Bosch books. Maybe it's because it was written originally as a newspaper serial. The book is not bad, but doesn't compare to his previous books. I hope Michael Connelly gets back to some excellent writing.
B000VI70WM|4.0|With or without their original guitarist Andy Taylor, Duran Duran is nothing short of producing hits. \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" is a great CD. It rejuvenates the band and puts the funk back into the heart and soul of their music. Simon LeBon's voice is powerful, poetic, and melodic as ever. It's amazing that his voice has not changed at all, despites some 25 years have past since the band produced their first hit single.     I think \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" contains more potential hits then their previous CD \\"Astronaut\\". Beside \\"Nite-runner\\", \\"Falling Down\\", \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\", and \\"The Valley\\", it would be a shame if beautiful songs like \\"She's Too Much\\" and \\"Skin Divers\\" are not aired on the radio across the nation. So contact your local radio stations and put in your request.    I really enjoy listening to this album. It's like going to an old familiar restaurant and try a delicious new dish. Buy it and crank it up if you're not familiar with Duran Duran. And if you're a fan like me, then you know what to do...    One last note, I give this album a 4-star because it's missing the 5th star. Duran Duran should welcome ex-guitarist Warren Cuccurullo who has been playing for Duran Duran since 1986 back into the band to complete the line up. He's their missing star. And F&*% Andy!

This CD wets his fans' appetites for more GARTH!
074325144X|4.0|I remember running sub 51 second 400m in high school, but I could never get under about 5:50 in a 1600m.  My friends who ran 58 second 400s ran 5 minute miles.  Why did I fall off a cliff in longer races?  My running form was pure power running and my distance form sucked - total heel striker. I guarantee that if you are a heel striker, you will benefit from this book.     Sure, the book is a bit foofy.  Oh well.  Also, the \\"junk scientist\\" (ma_brooks) who argues that there is no \\"power\\" generated by gravity misapprehends the physics of the form.  The force of gravity on a body can be reduced to a point force at the center of gravity.  The body is supported by the feet.  If the feet are behind the center of gravity, a torque is created at the feet which causes the body to fall forward -- moving the feet translates this torque to horizontal movement and no need to use calf muscles to push you forward.  You're not getting \\"free energy\\".  The WORK (i.e., power over a time) of the running is done -- not by gravity in pulling you forward -- but by your core, and to some extent, your larger leg muscles.  Force is not power is not work...

B000LPR9ZS|1.0|Plot? what plot? This movie didn't engage me in the least. And it also suffers from that \\"jerky camera syndrome\\" that seems to affect most of the movies today. I suspect this piece of tripe appeals to the anime, piercing and tattoo \\"video gaming is a sport\\" crowd, who still live at home when they're over 18. But if you have an IQ over 80 and work for a living, forget it and save your dough. Just pop in one of the many dawn of the dead movies, at least you'll care what happens to the characters.
B000O599WG|5.0|The movie is Howard Hawks' and John Wayne's follow up to Red River and when taken together must be considered the Best of the genre.    In my opinion this edition is too dark. The original while not of perfect quality is brighter and very enjoyable.

0765357151|3.0|Enjoyable but this is the very old original story without any modern day references. In addition, the primary story is only half of the book, the rest is made up of short stories.  I was disappointed because the hype suggested a rewrite.
1573921394|5.0|You must all please remember that Keynes was first-and-foremost a socialist.  His overall goal in creating his theories was to \\"prove\\" that socialist economic theories could function in the world of the early 20th century.  Read Keynes thru this screen, and you'll understand what he's attempting (unsuccessfully) to do.      I gave this book a 5 star rating for the following reason:  if you can overcome it's dryness and reliance on theories of little substance, you will see that socialism at large is truely bunk.  (having been educated formally in Keynsian theory, disproving it, and all it's socialist correlaries, is a passion of mine)  Please remember as you read this; if socialism and Keynesian economics was a viable theory for governments to function, the governments of the entire old eastern communist block would still be alive and functioning in their pre-1992 forms, and quasi-socialist countries the world over would be growing ever larger than the US economy once they've moved out of their manufacturing based economies and joined us in competing with other service based economies. (They have not been able to effectively compete beyond certain stages of growth)      Keynes' theory doesn't work.  His own writings are more theory and fantasy than reality.
1593082649|3.0|I have to disgree with my fellow reviewer on the delight to be found in Northanger Abbey. I am a great fan of Jane Austen's work and am also somewhat partial to Gothic romances so I expected to really enjoy Austen's satirical take on this genre. While it started off with promise, I soon found myself wishing it would end as there is little action until the latter chapters when Catherine Morland, the heroine, finally goes to Northanger Abbey. I won't deny that there is some pleasure to be had in Austen's wit and humorous take on Gothic romances but the majority of the story drags a bit and the ending feels almost too rushed.     Additionally, while it is clear that Austen created a heroine very different from those in her later work and that she is intentionally naive and easily influenced, she is difficult to like, making it hard to stay engaged with her story. Of course, Austen may have also done this intentionally as a way to hold Catherine up as an example of the failings of youth and the influence of this type of literature on a sheltered mind, but even in that case, it doesn't make the story any easier to enjoy.     It is certainly worth reading to see a different side of Jane Austen as well as to judge the progress of her style and thematic focus but it may not stand up as well against the talent and mastery shown in her other work.
0060578793|5.0|I am a CERT instructor and work for our city's Emergency Preparedness Dept. and I think this book provides a lot of useful information and advice.  Probably 99% of it I will never have a need to use, but the point is learning the skills to know how to take care of myself and family, not necessarily having to use them all.  People shouldn't assume that by reading this book that they are being \\"survivalists\\" or \\"alarmists\\"- this is just good information, well written and compiled, for the average person to expand their self-sufficiency and prepare for the unexpected.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|I won't write 1,000+ words ranting or raving on about this film, but I will put in a few remarks without simply listing out a detailed summary of the film. A little background, I saw the original Elizabeth in 1998 when I was in high school and loved it; it's still one of my favorite movies of all time. I am a history buff in the strictest sense, I have a bachelors and masters in history and am now working on a PhD in British history in the UK, but I still love good movies. The first Elizabeth film admittedly had its flaws, but in the end it generally got across an accurate enough story. When I heard a sequel was being made, I was so excited. And then I saw this crap...  Kapur said that he wanted this movie to be different from the first, as if he was making a totally different film, and boy did he succeed, but probably not in the way he intended. First of all, the characters were cardboard stereotypes and poorly written, directed and even acted. Don't get me wrong, I love Cate Blanchett, she's one of my favorites of all time, but in her defense, you can only do so much with what you are given. This Elizabeth is a one-dimensional, zombie of a spinster who the movie makers try so obviously and painfully to spell out for the audience that she isn't a woman that they want people to identify with, in fact they try in every way they can to set her apart as being as obviously abnormal as they can. For the whole movie she speaks in the same, old, monotone, voice, just like some kind of robot. It's painful to see such a great actress having to stunt all of her talent to force out such a stilted and shoddily developed character. The sloppy, sloppy attempt to show Elizabeth as having a possibly sexual relationship with Bess was just ridiculous and so poorly done that it ended up being insulting to the intelligence of the audience and even more so to the GLBT community by being so terribly written and performed.  Equally as insulting was the depiction of Philip II. Was it really necessary to depict the Spanish Armada as losing their battle because they didn't notice approaching English fire ships because they were so feverishly involved in what was depicted as cultish prayer? Give the Spanish a little more credit than that, and give the English a little more credit at being able to defeat their enemies for reasons beyond their inability to observe approaching enemies...  And one last thing, the one thing that I as an historian was picky about and was looking for going into the theater: showing Mary Queen of Scots as having a thick Scottish brogue? Seriously? Anyone who knows anything more about Mary than the pulp fiction legends and myths of the woman know that she grew up in France. It was an immediate signal to me that this film was going on sham research and would be pandering to an audience who they felt wouldn't notice or perhaps even care that they weren't just taking artistic liberties with histories but were turning it into a poorly written soap opera that wouldn't even be up to the level of quality one would expect on daytime TV.   I only wish I could erase the memories of this movie from my mind and only remember the first Elizabeth film. If you want to see a well-done portrayal of the later years of the life of Elizabeth I which is up to the level of that first film, I would suggest that you instead watch 'Elizabeth I' with Helen Mirren and Jeremy Irons.

B0009A40ES|5.0|I watched this film for the first time on New Years Day! I had tried to watch it years ago and never made it through, as I didn't understand that the film was satirical. Watching it with that in mind made me understand the film for what it was, very funny but also very dark. The director [and I assume the author] keeps us guessing whether what we are seeing is real or in Bateman's head. His thoughts are those of a serial killer, but did he really kill all those people??? Classic!

B000065PUE|5.0|From track one it's clear that 'Doolittle' is no ordinary rock album (how many albums cover topics as diverse as slicing up eyeballs and monkeys going to heaven). Not only is it arguably the Pixies' greatest album, but it was (and still is) wildly influential in the world of alternative and indie rock.    The production for the album is decidedly cleaner than that of past albums, but by no means is their sound watered down. On the contrary, the searing guitars, wailing vocals and sardonic, black humor all clash gloriously with the shinier production, creating a sort of schizophrenic listening experience. In fact tracks like 'Tame' and 'Crackity Jones' are some of the most abrasive tracks the Pixies have ever committed to tape.    At the same time the Pixies manage to successfully explore their poppier side. 'Here Comes Your Man' in particular is an excellent example of the band stretching into more pop-oriented territory, with it's incessantly catchy chorus and clean guitars burrowing deep into the listeners skull and cuddling up for a good long stay. The track seems to be at odds with the rest of the album, but somehow it manages to fit nicely into a collective whole with the rest of the songs. Thus is the brilliance of the Pixies...    It could be argued that this is not the Pixies' best album, but on a more general level this is easily the most diverse, accessible encapsulation of the bands sound. At no other time during their short stint did they sound as willfully poppy and abstract all at the same time. Doolittle is rightfully regarded as one of the defining alt-rock albums of all time.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|We commonly hear about Abraham Lincoln freeing slaves in the United States. However, many years before that, a courageous politician in England fought against the slave trade and then against slavery itself.  A brilliant speaker with courage to match, announced he would conquer slavery despite the British financial interest in that sphere. This became a life-long task.  This film, following the book closely, with its inspiring message for all of mankind is truly a movie to acquire and to keep in your home where it should remain in view of all who enter as a reminder of what great spirit can achieve against daunting odds. Makes a thoughtful gift when you search for such at holiday time.
B000ZN8036|5.0|This is the best and most underappreciated film of 2007.  I suspect that come oscar time it will garner an award or two, possibly Best Director for Sean Penn and Best Supporting Actor for Hal Holbrook.  I'm not holding my breath for Best Picture however as it's ultimately a bit too bleak and the main character too unconventional to be an easy sell to the Oscar crowd.  I absolutely loved everything about Into the Wild, most especially Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless who is amazing in his most impressive and challenging role to date.  It is very true to the book and whether you feel it is the sad chronicle of a misguided  youth or the ecstatic tale of one guys search for ultimate freedom, one couldn't ask for a more perfect adaptation.  One is left  regretful that McCandless only realized his epiphany too late...\\"Happiness is only real when shared.\\"
B000PA9Q6E|5.0|...Rod Serling? Eh, no, not quite.    Anyway. The couple of professional reviews I had read suggested that this was a good but somewhat superflous live album, certainly not a must-have, except for the really serious fan. So, I wasn't expecting great things.  But I was pleasantly surprised, actually. This is a really fine album, with extensive recording information and excellent liner notes by guitarist Bob Margolin, and the vast majority of these songs do not usually show up on the many live albums left behind by the great Muddy Waters.    Muddy Waters shares the slide guitar parts with Johnny Winter, who had produced and played on Muddy's then-brand new comeback LP, \\"Hard Again\\", and they are backed by a terrific band: Bob Margolin, bassist Charles Calmese, drummer Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith, pianist and occational vocalist Joe \\"Pinetop\\" Perkins, and the great James Cotton playing the harp. Cotton, Waters and Winter share lead vocals about equally between themselves, and the highlights are numerous: Johnny Winter performs a great, swinging \\"I Done Got Over It\\", originally by Guitar Slim. James Cotton rips through \\"the world's first rock n' roll song\\", Jackie Brenston's 1951 R&B single \\"Rocket 88\\". And Muddy Waters completely steals the show with one magnificent slide guitar fest, a pulsating rendition of his first hit single, \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\". Waters and Winter both play slide on this the finest cut on the album.    Other highlight include the opening medley, Johnny Winter's \\"Black Cat Bone\\" fused with \\"Dust My Broom\\" (it's basically the same song anyway), a driving, energetic performance of James Cotton's \\"How Long Can A Fool Go Wrong\\", the slow burner \\"Love Her With A Feeling\\", and of course the obligatory closer, \\"Got My Mojo Workin'\\".   But there are really no bad songs here. Great take on \\"Mama Talk To Your Daughter\\". Great \\"Dealin' With The Devil\\". Great stuff, great playing, and more lively, up-tempo numbers than on most live recordings featuring Muddy Waters, something which, to me at least, is a definite plus.     You might argue that Muddy Waters seriously overshadows Winter and Cotton in the vocal department, and why doesn't he sing all the songs? Well, it's true that he is the best and most commanding singer of the three, even here a few weeks before his 64th birthday. But part of the charm of this album is precisely this loose and relaxed feeling...Johnny sings a verse, then Muddy sings one, then James Cotton sings one, etc.   To me, this is a very worthy addition to the catalogue of all three men, one of the most enjoyable live blues records I have listened to for a long time. I can't see anyone with an interest in the music of Muddy Waters, or blues in general, not liking this one.  4 3/4 stars. Yummy!

B00009ATIX|4.0|This film is the second (or third, if you count [[ASIN:B000E1NXAY Event Horizon]]) big screen adaptation of Polish sci-fi author Stanislaw Lem's novel [[ASIN:0156027607 Solaris]].  The [[ASIN:B00006L92F first]] was made by the Russian master filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky, and incorporates Lem's intense speculation regarding a future in which our own hidden drives come to haunt us through our technologies with his own slowly meditative style.  Soderbergh's version highlights different aspects of the novel but remains a lavish and intense and very worthy adaptation.<br /><br />A psychologist travels to a remote space station -- orbiting a unique planet called Solaris -- in order to investigate the strange behavior of its crew and offer recommendations as to the future of the operation.  What he finds is a planet that works on your mind and memories in strange ways.  In the original novel, the core theme explored through this story seemed to be the impossibility of purely rational detachment and objectivity.  We cannot confront the phenomena of the cosmos without also coming to grips with ourselves and our own demons.<br /><br />In Tarkovsky's vision the voyage to outer space turns out to be a kind of metaphor for a certain kind of transcendence that turns out to be both false and impossible.  Genuine transcendence, in Tarkovsky's view, is not about detachment and is not (as traditionally conceived) a freeing of the mind from the confines of the body and from the bondage of our emotional life -- but involves the transformation of body, earth and feeling through art.  Soderbergh's version captures elements of both, but also reworks themes from his own work as early as \\"Sex, Lies and Videotape.\\"<br /><br />When James Cameron announced he was going to remake Tarkovsky's [[ASIN:B00006L92F Solaris]], based on the novel of the same name by Stanislaw Lem, I worried that he was going to turn it from a compelling meditation on our desire for transcendence into a B-horror sci-fi pic with high production values.  That had already been done, I thought, and not all that badly, in [[ASIN:B000E1NXAY Event Horizon]] (an obvious but uncredited loose adaptation where the demons from the characters' pasts generated by the planet -- in this case a black hole -- turn out to be literally that: demons from Hell).  Luckily, Cameron decided to turn the project over to Stephen Soderbergh.  I got interested again -- and Soderbergh delivered with a gorgeously filmed and very intriguing arthouse science fiction near-masterpiece.  His film is not so much a remake of Tarkovsky's film as a reconsideration of the original novel, that is in some ways more faithful to the novel, but that at the same time takes up themes unique to Tarkovsky's vision and reworks them in ways that fit with Soderbergh's own obsessions: less with the possibility of spiritual transcendence and more with the difficulties of intimacy and trust and of the ways memories and guilt haunt the present.<br /><br />George Clooney is perfect as Chris Kelvin, played here as a once-confident and cocky man haunted by loss.  Although the film's box office suffered because the film was marketed as an action picture with a flashy George Clooney as star, and then audiences saw a brooding and contemplative film that was as far as possible from the flash of Ocean's Eleven, this is to my mind one of Clooney's best performances and certainly showed what he was capable of before films like [[ASIN:B000F7CMRM Syriana]] and [[ASIN:B00121QGPY Michael Clayton]].  Though Jeremy Davies seems to be stuck in a certain kind of role, he was perfect for this one as a brilliant but neurotic and extremely paranoid scientist, an intriguing alternative to the role played by Anatoli Solonitsyn in Tarkovsky's version.  What I think is most interesting about the film is the way that Soderbergh takes the basic idea and reworks it in ways that involve reconsiderations of the themes from films like [[ASIN:0767812158 sex, lies, and videotape]] and [[ASIN:B0000BUZKS Schizopolis]]: the ways we create false masks for our lovers to hide our insecurities, that art can work as a kind of false memory, allowing us to reconstruct our past and achieve a false intimacy without risk.  The basic science fiction conceit of Solaris is that the planet is able to replicate memories and especially those one would like to repress because they are unsettling and generate guilt, and bring them back to life, and the varying reactions to these replications suggest different ways of dealing with memories and images and of reconciling ourselves to the failures and guilt in the past.  Soderbergh makes this a story of how one man is able to reconcile himself with his own guilt by collaborating in the creation of and then embracing a lie, a fiction, an artwork.ZKS Schizopolis]]: the ways we create false masks for our lovers to hide our insecurities, that art can work as a kind of false memory, allowing us to reconstruct our past and achieve a false intimacy without risk.

B000QUCNOK|5.0|When I saw Perfume, I figured it to be another B-movie that might occupy some time. What I found in that movie's place was another movie, a more interesting one with an interesting cruel side, and that was really worth a watch. We start with a man hat claims he can identify any smell in the world and that he wants to own them all. To do this he has plans; some of his plans seem not-so-bad at first but then they take on a darker shade. And that's where the fun begins and an interesting story starts playing out.<br /><br />One of the main reasons this movie was so successful was the ability of our lead character to seem so many things at once. Sometimes you cold taste the menace that swirled around and sometimes you could see other pieces of persona swimming around in his tangled expressions. The life he gave tot the role was amazing because of this - I expected few things going in to the movie but I really didn't expect someone to so brazenly steal the spotlight.<br />He was perfect.<br />The support cast was really god as well, and all these efforts combined helped build a rather interesting storyline that I would have missed if it had not been for a suggestion on rentals.<br /><br />If you want a diversion that is out-of-the-ordinary and like the way the plot to the movie goes, then this might be a pick for you. I enjoyed it but, at the same time, I was looking for a B-movie to fill in my watching void and was happy that it was superbly better than \\"B.\\" Still, it comes with a \\"worth watching\\" if you like your story with a little darkside attached to it underpinning.

0385720920|4.0|Choke by Chuck Palahnuik ****<br /><br />A pehonomal story of self finding. Palahnuik's style doesn't work as well in Choke as with say Fight Club, but the story of a sex-addicted medical school drop out who trys to pay for his psychotic mothers stay and a care center by faking as if he is choking on his food in up-scale restuarants around town and having them foot the bill for his meal does make for one interesting story.<br /><br />While it's not his strongest story Palahnuik does solidify the hype in this overly creative tale. While the main protagonist Victor Mancinni takes care of his Alzheimer's stricken mother he tries to desifer a ancient journal of heres trying to find out the meaning of his life and who is father is, and in the end he learns more then he wished for.<br /><br />The one thing that continues to make this book really shine and showcase the true talent and genius of the author is his amazing ability to create and develope fantastic characters. Choke contains some of his best, his sick mother, his best friend who is fired from a 1700's theme park for leaving character while on the job, and a Pam-Anderson esque stripper, make this entertaining no matter where the plot might lack. That is rare.<br /><br />This sick and twisted tale from the mind of one of the worlds greater modern day writers is a must read.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I had mixed feelings going into this movie.  On the one hand I had `The Incredibles' in memory, one of the finest cartoons ever made.  On the other I had `Cars' still in recent memory, one of the most overrated, over hyped pieces of cartoon garbage I had the horror of having to sit through.  Thankfully `Ratatouille' leans towards `The Incredibles', delivering one of the most refreshing and entertaining cartoon experiences in recent memory.  Cartoon's as of late have been on the dull side, none really jumping out and saying \\"I am the next classic, I am the movie your children and your children's children will love forever\\", until now.  Now, this isn't to say that `Ratatouille' is perfect, because in my opinion `The Incredibles' is a better all around film, but `Ratatouille' is the finest film to be released in cartoon form since it's glorious predecessor (I know, I really need to see `Persepolis', and I will eventually).<br /><br />`Ratatouille' revolves around Remy, a young rat who, unlike the rest of his pack, really cherishes food.  Sure, his fellow rats love to eat, but they'll eat anything.  Remy only wants the best food he can attain.  He's picky.  Living in France Remy has become fascinated with the famed chef Auguste Gusteau and is brokenhearted to hear that he has died suddenly upon receiving a scathing review by food critic Anton Ego.  Auguste firmly believed that anyone could cook and even wrote a book to that effect, a book that Remy would sneak out to read.  When an unfortunate event separates Remy from his family he finds himself in Paris with the most desirable of opportunities at his paws.<br /><br />Remy finds the late Gusteau's restaurant, now run by his sous-chef Skinner, a man who is as intolerable as he is feisty.  He is soon propositioned by a young garbage boy, Linguini, who, thanks to Remy, has been mistaken for a chef with talent and been promoted to the important position.  With Remy's talent and Linguini's human looks they pass off as the best chef Paris has ever seen, but a secret that Skinner is privy to leads him to work his hardest to thwart Linguini's progress.<br /><br />`Ratatouille' does a brilliant job of not only delivering state of the art animation (the movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at) but delivering a warm and touching story that gives real heart to these characters.  Remy's love for food, his passion and his determination to be himself despite the disapproval of those closest to him (namely his father) is admirable and teaches us the importance of fighting for what we believe in, for what we know is our destiny.  It also reigns forward with lessons on loyalty and humility, of honesty and compassion.  It teaches children and adults alike that these are admirable and commendable traits we all should strive to achieve.<br /><br />The voice talents enlisted here are superb, Patton Oswald delivering magnificently as Remy and Peter O'Toole truly stealing the show as the feared critic Anton Ego.<br /><br />With it's keen eye to detail, both in imagery and in story, `Ratatouille' proves itself deserving of all the praise that has been heaped upon it's sturdy shoulders and manages to be one of the only cartoons in recent years to be worthy of the Animated Feature Oscar.  Let's just say that if `Ratatouille' loses this year it'll be a crying shame, to know that the mediocre at best `Happy Feet' has an Oscar and this magical adventure does not.  Well, I have a feeling that this little rat will run full force to the podium this year to accept his very well deserved prize.est chef Paris has ever seen, but a secret that Skinner is privy to leads him to work his hardest to thwart Linguini's progress.<br /><br />`Ratatouille' does a brilliant job of not only delivering state of the art animation (the movie is BEAUTIFUL to look at) but delivering a warm and touching story that gives real heart to these characters.

B000Z0OX9O|5.0|I've been listening to disc 2 & 3 quite a bit and they are in a word, outstanding. Running relatively short for CD format (disc 2 @ 44:00 and disc 3 @ 48:18) they are nontheless exquisite examples of Vangelis' best work. These two discs, unlike the original OST on disc 1, are more ambient than melodic. The original release of disc 1 was exciting at the time (1994?), most notably for the gorgeous \\"Bladerunner Blues\\" and \\"Rachel's Song\\", but as a whole the OST was kind of all over the place: some voice-overs; some hard almost techno sounds; the anachronistic \\"One More Kiss, Dear\\". Listened to as one CD disc 2 & 3 feel much more representive of the original score than disc 1. Some themes are repeated as with track 12 of disc 2 which is \\"Tears in the Rain\\" without the Batty voice-over. There is also much exquisite new music on discs 2 & 3. Most notable are \\"Desolation Path\\" on disc 2 and \\"Piano in an Empty Room\\" on disc 3. This 3 disc set is not very economically priced as I'm sure most Bladerunner or Vangelis fans have had the OST CD for over 10 years, but I still recommend this set very highly. And if Bryant calls, \\"Tell him I'm eating.\\"
B00000K2W1|5.0|Joplin's version of Gershwin's \\" Summertime \\" is arguably one of the best song's ever recorded. The rest of the album is very good. She was one of a kind.
B00104W8T6|5.0|The songs in the soundtrack to Juno fit perfectly with the movie. They are soft, folksy, slightly eccentric, and capture the emotional aura of the film's story, characters, and message. I will comment on each of the songs.    * All I Want is You: A delightfully zany song about love; uses analogies (\\"if you were the wood, I'd be the fire\\") to get the point across. It's folksy, using the harmonica and guitar.    *My Rollercoaster: A lyric-less song, with the artist just singing \\"doo-doo-doo.\\" Still, with its whimsical feel, it definitely is in keeping with the spirit of the rest of the album.    * A Well-Respected Man: A nice \\"soft-rock\\" song about a well to-do man. It reminds me of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Richard Corey,\\" but without the tragic ending.    * Dearest: Buddy Holly. Need I say more?    * Up the Sprout: A short guitar piece that is soft, yet has some \\"edgy\\" measures.    * Tire Swing: Kimya Dawson is really a revelation. Her soft-spoken eloquence really shines through. This is another soft-rock song that discusses the writer's experiences with her boyfriend. It includes a canon, which adds spice to the song.    * Piazza, New Catcher: A song about a baseball catcher, who struggles with love and life. This one's fast-moving and has several minor chords.    * Loose Lips: An apt title for the song; Dawson speaks freely. This one's pretty fast-moving, so pay attention.    * Superstar: Definitely the edgiest song on this album, from Sonic Youth, no less. It has a bittersweet feel.    * Sleep: An instrumental song, with humming by Kimya Dawson. Another soft, folksy, sweet song.    * Expectations: A fast, fairly sad song. It's a nice contrast with the rest of the album.    * All the Young Dudes: A great classic rock song, with hints of soul and jazz. Mott the Hopple belts the lyrics out emotionally.    * So Nice So Smart: Kimya Dawson again. Don't let the sunny tune of this song fool you- it's actually quite dark! The chorus is:   \\"you're so nice and you're so smartyou're such a good friend i hafta break your heart  tell you that i love you then i'll tear your world apart  just pretend i didn't tear your world apart\\"    * Sea of Love: A slow, melancholy love song.    * Tree Hugger: Think of this as a folk poem song. To give you an idea:   \\"The flower said, `I wish I was a tree,'  The tree said, `I wish I could be  A different kind of tree,'  The cat wished that it was a bee,  The turtle wished that it could fly  Really high into the sky,  Over rooftops and then dive  Deep into the sea.\\"    *I'm Sticking with You: A self-consciously corny song, but an enjoyable one. It has the \\"oom-pah\\" chords and starts out with piano, though it switches to a regular guitar sound eventually. The song begins with \\"I'm sticking with you, `cause I'm made out of glue.\\" This is definitely not for all tastes- it depends on what your threshold for cheese is.     *Anyone Else But You: A guy and a girl singing to each other about how they couldn't be with \\"anyone else but you.\\" The Moldy Peaches aren't the best singers, but they're good enough to keep the listener interested, and the music and lyrics are sweet and folksy. This is Kimya Dawson's old band.    *Vampire: A kind of strange song; the singer compares himself (the singer's a 12 year-old boy) to a vampire and sees herself as a social outcast.    *Anyone Else But You: Michael Cera and Ellen Page sing the Moldy Peaches song. This is sweet, and I think their performance is better than the original.

I don't think we have ever played it to the end.  I think it might be for a little bit older children.  Mine don't ask to watch it so I figure I'll pull it back out in a couple of years and try again.

I loaded it in the car and I like it better. The more I listen the more I like it. Not as heavy or catchy as youthinasia, rust in piece, etc. Still a pretty standard megadeath album with great riffs solo's and political lyrics. I'm need to research, but I think other then Dave this album has all new members in the band.
0375842381|5.0|I love reading children's novels--I read all the Harry Potter with my grandchildren. But this trilogy stands far and above the rest in its examination of the current human condition in the context of fantasy worlds.    It explores honor, justice, truth, loyalty and principle and the human psyche under circumstances both fantastic and familiar at the same time.    I recommend it highly for everyone. I's not for very young children.
B000X5KSWM|4.0|I was so happy when I got my hands on this CD! I have been following Nightwish's career for some time, and Tarja's voice is what made me listen to them in the first place. Her voice is AMAZING on here! However, the album is not without it's flaws. I felt that the 18-track album was a little missleading because some of the songs are just intros. The album took a little getting used to. But now I love it! When I heard the cover song \\"Poison\\" I almost jumped out of my skin! Although, everyone else I've played it for, thinks it's horrible! (they are BIG Alice Cooper fans!) My favorite songs, are of course, the heviest ones, but I do apperciate what she is trying to do with the slower songs. If you are looking for Nightwish, you won't find much of it here. She has her own unique style and I think that it's wonderful! More 4.5 stars than 4. I just couldn't give it 5 stars because of all the \\"intro\\" tracks and one or two duds.

This movie is terrific for both kids and adults. Our whole family thoroughly enjoyed it and we have viewed it several times.

B000YCLRBA|4.0|I am a big fan of Eugene Onegin and watched this opera several times at various opera houses, including once at Bolshoi (the \\"old\\" Bolshoi of 1980s). Therefore, I have had quite high expectations after seeing parts of this performance on TV a few months ago. Yesterday, after the DVD arrived in the mail, I could barely wait to get home to watch it. Honestly, I was disappointed.  Please do not get me wrong. This production is still very good, just it is not the ultimate Eugene Onegin I hoped it would be. Hvorostovsky is outstanding, he is definitely the best Onegin I ever heard. At the same time, Fleming as Tatiana is not as good as I expected. After watching this DVD, I listened for a while to my old CD set with Galina Vishnevskaya as Tatiana (Bolshoi, recorded in 1950s), and in my opinion Vishnevskaya's singing is highly superior to that of Fleming. Also, maybe a factor was the awful quality of the English translation, which totally emasculates the rich Pushkin poetry.  Sometimes I had the feeling Fleming had no idea what was the real meaning of the words she was singing, and it really spoiled the impression of her acting (wrong gestures, wrong expressions). At times, like in the middle of the first act (Onegin and Tatiana returning from their walk), she seemed not to know what to do and, rather than acting, was looking intently at Hvorostovsky for clues. This was disappointing. Overall, this is a good performance, and Hvorostovski is absolutely brilliant. However, it is not \\"the\\" ultimate Eugene Onegin I hoped it would be.

159102594X|4.0|The Blade Itself is Joe Abercrombie's debut novel, and a solid first effort. Reminiscent of George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, the book is filled with gritty, believable characters, and a foundation of what promises to be a broad, well-developed plot.<br /><br />The plot in this installment is pretty basic: the old empire is crumbling, with \\"barbaric\\" peoples knocking at the door, but most are unaware of a greater, more sinister threat that looms.<br /><br />The story is character-driven. Glotka the Inquisitor, a scarred veteran whose injuries and disfigurements make him look like an old man, is a complex character with a sharp, biting intellect. He is the most intriguing of a varied cast of characters. The dialog is particularly well-crafted, and Abercrombie draws the reader in so deeply that you find yourself chuckling or sometimes laughing aloud at the one-liners and the give-and-take between the characters.<br /><br />The only areas of relative weakness for me were the anachronistic profanities (modern profanity in a fantasy novel tends to jolt me out of the reading experience) and the lack of emphasis on plot. The plotting issue is, of course, a stylistic choice. Fans of Steven Erickson and Scott Lynch will likely enjoy Abercrombie's style, while readers of mainstays like Raymond Feist and David Eddings will find the the plot sorely lacking.<br /><br />The Blade Itself is an entertaining debut by a talented new author. Pick it up if you are looking for a new fantasy author who is not encumbered by the traditions of the genre.

0316067598|2.0|Luttrell and Robinson have a compelling and heroic story to tell but they made a mess of it.  The initial 160 pages detail the brutal screening and training that SEALs must endure.  This would have been more interesting if the authors could have been a bit more introspective about the experience. Rather, they sound like some amped recruitment poster, lit up in neon.  Ex: \\"Because above all, we're patriots.  We will willingly carry the fight to whoever may be the enemies of the United States of America.  We're your front line, unafraid and ready to go in against al Qaeda, jihadists, terrorists, or whoever the hell else threatens this nation.\\" (p 159)    All this is reasonable and expected -- hell, I read a book like this for the can-do and patriotic attitude that our soldiers marshal.  But, midway through this book, it became unclear who, exactly, the authors consider a threat.  As the autobiography progresses, it becomes clear that Luttrell is filled with hate.  He hates a great many things. And, unfortunately, many of his hates are things that define America.      He hates the free media.  He hates liberals.  He hates politicians (except Bush 1 & 2).  He hates intellectuals.  And, if you combine some of these terms -- say, a liberal intellectual in the media -- well, Luttrell sounds dangerously close to considering such a person a lethal threat.  I kid you not.    Did I mention that he also regrets not having knifed three Afgan sheep herdsman?  By his account, he and three of his fellow SEALs were discovered while observing Taliban.  They captured the three goat herders that happened across their position.  Knowing they were potentially compromised, the SEALs debated the merits of murdering the three and throwing their bodies off a cliff.  The final vote for the murder?  3:1 in FAVOR of killing the civilians.  However, fearing the \\"liberal media\\" and, oh, maybe a war crimes trial, the vote had to be unanimous.  So, reluctantly, they let the shepherds go.      Ok, one question.  Why didn't they pack any of those light-weight plastic band handcuffs?  Their mission was, after all, to potentially nab a bad guy, anyhow.  And, failing that, couldn't they still have torn up some cloth and tied the guys up?      Anyhow, they didn't and the shepherds did, indeed, stir up the Taliban troops and caused the US many terrible deaths.  It is an understatement but clearly Luttrell feels awful about what happened.  His rage, though, is directed at his fellow Americans and anyone else that does not agree with his concept of total war.    Unfortunately, in this one short chapter, Luttrell inadvertently did more harm to the reputation of the SEALs and US military than anything else I have ever read.  I bought this book to learn of the soldiers' heroics.  In that he succeeded.  But, along with the good, a very ugly picture emerged.    I recommend avoiding this book.  Unless, that is, you want to be disturbed at what this war is doing to the ethics of the Best of our very Best.

B000QXDEDG|5.0|Normally I don't like super violent movies, but the graphics with this one makes it one of my favorites. The plot is based in true historical events (but there is not accounting for creative license, eh?). If you liked the style of Sin City I highly recommend 300. The soundtrack to this movie is unexpected, but awesome!

B000XCZGV8|5.0|After the technically accomplished but ultimately hollow thriller [[ASIN:B0001AVZCQ Panic Room (3-Disc Special Edition)]], director David Fincher returns to familiar subject matter with Zodiac, a dramatization of the murders perpetuated by the infamous serial killer known as Zodiac that terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. With [[ASIN:B000050FEN Seven (New Line Platinum Series)]], Fincher seems like an obvious choice to direct this film but those of you expecting a rehash of that film will be disappointed. With Zodiac, he faces the daunting challenge of making an exciting thriller that runs two hours and forty minutes long where the killer was never caught. He does this by focusing on the people who investigated the case and how it affected them.<br /><br />This is a film that shows people talking and doing research - hardly, dynamic, cinematic material but Fincher makes it fascinating with strong performances from his talented cast and a solid screenplay to anchor the film. Like Michael Mann's equally obsessive serial killer movie, [[ASIN:B00008V5RP Manhunter (Restored Director's Cut Divimax Edition)]], Fincher spends a lot of his movie showing offices buzzing with activity as the case heats up and we see people hard at work as the police, FBI, the Chronicle and even the CIA all try to decipher the Zodiac's code and solve the case. He also show the minutia of their methods while also reminding us of the limits of technology at the time (no personal computers, no internet, no DNA testing, etc.). These people faced a monumental task of sifting through hundreds of false leads and crank calls from the substantial information that might actually further the case.<br /><br />Zodiac presents a wealth of information and invites you to sift through it like the three protagonists. In fact, there is so much to absorb that repeated viewings will undoubtedly reveal more details that might not have been caught upon an initial viewing. The film's long running time allows you to gradually immerse yourself in the film and the story it tells. However, it never feels too long because Fincher maintains a brisk, efficient pace cramming as much detail and information as he can into every scene. The killer is a fascinating enigma and his encrypted letters, his blatant taunting of the police, and the discrepancies between murders only it makes it more interesting. It is easy to see why people became obsessed with this case. Ultimately, the Zodiac case doesn't just leave a trail of actual bodies but also collateral damage in the form of failed marriages, ended partnerships and substance abuse. And this is just the people who investigated the case. The toll taken on the victims who survived, their families and those of the people who were killed is inconceivable. A whole other movie could be made about them. Fincher has made a smart, engaging thriller that suggests a new direction for the filmmaker, one that places an emphasis on character and story instead of atmosphere and set design.<br /><br />Last year, Paramount released an obligatory bare bones DVD and in the meantime, Fincher and DVD producer extraordinaire, David Prior have assembled an in-depth two-disc special edition that covers all aspects of the production. The director has also added five minutes back into the film that improves on an already great motion picture.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by director David Fincher. He touches upon the \\"oddly personal\\" period details as much of the film takes place during his childhood and around areas he lived. This also informed the period songs he picked for the film. This is the kind of engaging, informative track we've come to expect from Fincher.<br /><br />Even better is the second commentary by actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr., producer Brad Fischer, screenwriter James Vanderbilt, and crime novelist James Ellroy. Fischer and Vanderbilt talk about how closely they stuckto the actual facts of the case and delve into its details. Ellroy, a self-proclaimed fan of the film, does his entertaining Demon Dog of crime fiction persona that fans of his love while also talking about the film's place in crime fiction. Downey and Gyllenhaal provide all kinds of anecdotal information with Downey displaying his trademark dry sense of humour.<br /><br />The second disc is broken up into two sections: extras dealing with the film and ones dealing with the actual Zodiac murders. \\"Zodiac Deciphered\\" is an hour-long documentary on the making of the film. Producer Brad Fischer and screenwriter James Vanderbilt talk about the origins of the project. We see how each of the film's key locations were faithfully recreated, often shooting at the place where one of the murders took place. Period costumes were authentically recreated from police reports and evidence photographs. When actual locations could not be used, the San Francisco Chronicle offices, they were built from scratch on a soundstage. Fincher nailed the newspaper office down to the tiniest details like vintage rotary phones, typewriters, etc. There is plenty of on-the-set footage that shows Footage and co. at work.<br /><br />\\"The Visual Effects of Zodiac\\" takes a look at how CGI was used not only to recreate certain period details of San Francisco but also the blood in the murder scenes. We see before and after comparison shots and it is incredible how seamlessly the effects are integrated into the film.<br /><br />The \\"Previsualization\\" for three scenes compares the computer animated storyboards with the final product in the film.<br /><br />Also included is a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />\\"This is the Zodiac Speaking\\" is a four-part documentary on the actual Zodiac murders, featuring interviews with original investigators and the surviving victims. These featurettes present the facts of each murder along with crime scene photographs and vintage TV news footage, taking us through each one in detail.<br /><br />Finally, there is \\"His Name was Arthur Leigh Allen.\\" Police investigators and people that knew him talk about the prime suspect in the Zodiac murders.

0679736646|4.0|Where PKD falters in prose style (and there are some \\"ouches\\" in this book) he makes up for in strong plot, imagination, pacing, and overall brio.  There is a lovely gratuitous scene in which a women removes her shirt.  No reason.  Hence one is transported, in a cool way, to the Sixties, and the exigencies of publishing at that time.  Call it a meta-appreciation.  But that great plot idea!
0765318741|5.0|I bought this book after seeing the film because a friend told me that the movie was completely different. It is almost like the film was based on a brief two minute description of the book.<br /><br />The book is a real masterpiece of sci fi-horror writing, much darker and deeper than the film, which is a very much a popularised feel good Hollywood knock off in comparison (even if it is a good film). I won't go over the story itself, as other people have already done a very good job of that. It is very short, so it can easily be read in and evening or an afternoon, but it is definitely a worthwhile read.
B000MXPE74|5.0|I'm more into hard rock, metal, etc... but when I first heard Flathead on the iPod commercial, I was hooked and had to wait 2 months for the album to come out. I didn't think it'd be that good, I was thinking Flathead would be the only good song... I was very wrong. So many more amazing songs than Flathead.<br />The Fratellis are most definitely a big breath of fresh air. I've had the album since it came out back in March '07 and I still listen to it when I want something different, but good. I also saw them live last year and they were just as amazing live... (I had to, any band that can make an album this brilliant, will definitely get me at their shows).<br />Brilliant album, I definitely recommend it :c)

If this is your only Crossroads DVD you'll enjoy the music and the interviews, but I suggest you get the first of the series.  This one lacks something I just cant put into words, its still enjoyable but its just missing that certain once~in~a~lifetime magic the first DVD has to offer!  Sorry Eric, I love your music and love your continued support of the Crossroads Centre but I wasn't in awe this time.

B000KWZ7VU|5.0|Beethoven was a revolutionary man living in a revolutionary time. He captured his inner voice, demons and all and the spirit of his time, and in doing so, created a body of music the likes of which no one had ever before imagined. A virtuoso at the keyboard, Beethoven used the piano as his personal musical laboratory, and the piano sonata became, more than any other genre of music, a place where he could experiment with harmony and his developing view of music as a self expressive art. Spanning the length of his compositional career, Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas provide a window into his personal musical development, and they show the concept of the piano as an instrument and the piano sonata as a genre undergoing an extraordinary evolution. The sonatas are not simply compositions for the piano, but are about the developing technology of the piano itself, an evolving instrument that Beethoven pushed to its limits and then beyond, ultimately writing music for an idealized piano that didn't come into existence until about 40 years after he died. Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas include some of his most popular works that took him about 30 years to compose gradually transforming a medium that Mozart and Haydn had already turned into a staple of Classical expression to a vehicle for personal expression that takes us to the time of 19th century Romanticism. These works were very much intended for home entertainment, and Beethoven initially continued that tradition by writing a number of works for his students to play. But as he began to be affected by deafness, playing the piano became his only tangible means of, as it were, 'hearing' music.     There's no denying Beethoven's capacity for communing with the soul through his piano. The adventures in form and musical working out of ideas were all part of this need to say things in music that had never been said before. Beethoven was constantly striving for more, particularly in range and dynamic capability. As an example, he composed the \\"Hammerklavier\\" Sonata about seven years before he had a piano that could cope with its demands of register. He often said, \\"The whole tribe of pianoforte manufacturers have been swarming around me in their anxiety to serve me and all for nothing.\\" Just one more example of the way Beethoven in his sonatas was always ahead of the game.  In this 6 DVD set Daniel Barenboim does an amazing job of playing all of Beethoven's sonatas and what truly baffles and impresses me the most every time I watch this set is that he plays them all by memory. This is a wonderful set and anyone interested in seeing Beethoven's sonatas performed will not be disappointed.  Truly, Beethoven's piano music is his voice, emerging from his mind, through his fingers, to our ears and hearts. And his piano sonatas are, more than any other of his amazing works, his personal testament, expressed in his own voice.

0786891181|4.0|[[ASIN:140130916X PS, I Love You]] I enjoyed this book. It took me on an emotional rollercoaster, and brought me to tears numerous times, so make sure you have your box of tissues handy. It was romantic, poignant and sad. But it also had its fun, lighter parts as well. Basically, the main character, Holly Kennedy, who is not yet 30, has to come to terms with the loss of her young husband and does so with the help from letters written by her husband before he dies. He helps her cope and move on. I found myself absorbed in the anticipation of each letter.     I read it before seeing the movie and I'm glad I did. The book is very different from the movie. So, if you read the book after seeing the movie you will discover that many of the details in the book are changed or left out in the movie. I found myself partly upset that they changed or left out so much and partly smug because I knew what 'really happened' in the book. Nevertheless, I did like the movie. (How could it go wrong with Gerard Butler!!)
1594489505|5.0|This is the story of two women who live in Afghanistan before, during, and after the Taliban regime.  Mariam, the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy man, was scorned by society and forced to live in squalor.  When she was fifteen, she did a rash and foolish thing that changed her life forever.  Soon she was living far away in the city of Kabul, married to a brutish pig of a man, and subjected to daily beatings.<br /><br />Laila grew up in Kabul, daughter of a compassionate father and withdrawn mother.  Her best friend was her neighbor, Tariq; he was her confidant and later, her passion.  When she was fourteen, life as she knew it was over in a moment, and she, too, became a wife, subject to the same injustices as Mariam.<br /><br />Mariam and Laila are women who see life through the fine net grill of their powder blue burqas, who have no control over their lives or bodies, who do the only thing Mariam's mother said women can do - they endure.  While gunfire and bombs rain all around them, they grow up and grow old.  This story is heartbreaking, infuriating, and shocking.  There is so much misery that some readers may be put off, but I had to keep reading to see what would happen to Mariam and Laila next.  I loved Hosseini's first novel, \\"The Kite Runner,\\" and I think \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is even better.  Heartily recommended.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I too am tired of all the negative reviews.  3 stars? HARDLY!!  I personally LOVE this CD and it is my favorite Linkin Park CD by far. I heard \\"Shadow of the Day\\" on the radio and sensed that this was a new direction for Linkin Park, so I was very intrigued and bought the album without knowing anything about it.  I am so glad I did! The songs just keep running through my head and I can't get enough of it.  It is true, the Chester screaming/rap songs are largely missing from this album, so if that is all you want to see out of Linkin Park, then this is not the album for you.  But I enjoy LP on many different levels, and the lyrics and melodies on this one are simply outstanding.     It really bugs me that whenever a band is in a particular genre, people only want to hear more of the same, and as soon as they branch out or do something different, they get panned.  I guess it's somewhat to be expected, since a band's particular sound is what its initial popularity is based on, and if that changes, it may no longer be as popular.  But as human beings we all need to grow and experiment, so I don't see why we are so averse to hearing something different from a group we know and love.     Bottom line, I try to keep an open mind, and I figure it's only a $10 or $13 risk, so if I don't like it, oh well.  I'll sell it at 2nd Hand Tunes if it's really awful.  Which, fortunately, I won't have to do with Minutes to Midnight- this one is definitely a keeper and will go into my regular commute CD rotation.
B000068FXX|5.0|I just got the 1997 AM/Universal  Import version used.  It sounds wonderful!  (label on mine says Audio Master+ series 394634-2 made in Germany)  It is very clear and UN-digital /ungrating /unharsh (no \\"volume wars\\") - and cheaper too!   Musically it's a great album, there is a fond place in my heart for this ...record.  : )
B00001OH7N|5.0|This is a great Bowie classic. The Controversial cover aside, this CD (or LP) was a Classic then and the remixed sound really makes it stellar to the old album. The sound was really muddy, but the remix makes it much more listen-able.<br /><br />I personally think that this CD, Made in 1970, was Bowie's most energetic release for that early 70's period. This album was an introduction of sorts to a 'band' style of Bowie. Where the albums 'Space Oddity' and 'Hunky Dory' could be seen more as Bowie solo albums, this one sounds like a band effort. Almost like they all jammed together and melded ideas. The heaviness of Ronson's guitar and Bowie's vocal style made for a great pairing, but even the drums and bass are jamming here. its loose and fun, like a real 70's jam band, but also has that Bowie mystique. A sign of things to come with Ziggy Stardust, this album is raw but the band is tight.<br /><br />My personal favorites are the title track, the psychedelic 'Black Country Rock', the incredible 'Width of a Circle'(very heavy for its time) , 'Savior Machine' and the grim 'After All'.<br /><br />Its a creepy but heavy CD. Very cool and should have been called the 'David Bowie Band' CD. The remix is essential and i like the fact that they used the old 'banned' artwork again. Bowie was really on a roll between 1969 - 1977 artistically. This should be viewed in the same class of Zeppelin and Cream in terms of quality classic Rock for its time.
B000024RQX|5.0|Just got this in the mail.  I owned this on LP when it first came out 30 years ago.   I was a mere pup!  : )    This brings back many memories and experiences.  Good and sweet times, the uncertainty and hope of youth. ANYWAY...just wanted to say the comment someone else made about the harshness latest remasters (circa 2002 or later) got me to buy this 1997 version.  I'm glad I did!    Supposedly the 2002 release is a victim of \\"volume wars\\" (too hot of a gain which distorts sound - it's a trend of late the record companies do).    I can't verify the sound of the 2002 version.      But, I * can * tell you that this 1997 German Import has * wonderful * sound.  Clear but unforced / unharsh.  It sounds like very good analog. Rare on most CDs really.

0375714839|5.0|The books Persepolis: Story of a Childhood and Persepolis 2: Story of a Return are combined here due to the release of the animated film. It is presented as a graphic novel with illustrations.<br /><br />Satrapi was born in 1969 in Iran, the only child of educated and intelligent parents who raised her to think for herself. She was surrounded by political and philosophical discussions from an early age. During her childhood she saw the take over by Islamic fundamentalists, the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and the Iran-Iraq war. When she was 10 she had to wear the veil to school.<br /><br />At age 14 her parents decided to send her to live in Austria, where they had friends who could care for her, and they enrolled her in a French school. Persepolis 2 is the story of her disconnected life in Austria. Angry at misconceptions about her country, worried about her parents, and longing to fit in, she struggles a great deal.<br /><br />After a betrayal by a boyfriend and an accusation by her landlady, she lives on the streets until she wakes up in hospital. She returns home, and suffers from severe depression at all the changes. Eventually she is able to adapt, meets a young man, enrolls in art college, and marries. Her independent spirit, however, ensures she will be unhappy-and she leaves for college in France after a divorce.<br /><br />These books are praised for their brilliant evocation of turbulent times in a very unusual culture. The art is simple and striking.<br /><br />Armchair Interviews says: This story is riveting.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|A Great family movie!!!  This one had my husband, myself and the kids laughing together.
038572179X|4.0|Atonement is a novel that follows the story of two young lovers-Cecilia Tallis, an educated woman from a wealthy family and Robbie Turner, a son of a servant who was educated through the grace of Cecilia's family. Just as their love is beginning to grow, tragedy, misunderstanding, and ill will tear them apart. Love and determination keep them in contact, even through the ravages of World War II. Guilt, family bonds, and the desire to make amends, drive the characters to find the proper means to correct the errors of the past.    It is a gripping story that takes a little while to get going, but once you are hooked, there is no putting it down. One of the major strengths of the story is you immediately empathize with all of the characters. From the simple trials of childhood, to the ache of lost love and family conflicts, the novel touches on emotions we have all felt.    It is obvious that a great deal of historical research went into this novel, and this added nice touches throughout the story, enhancing the characters and settings. From the cut of nurse's uniforms to the pangs of a soldiers thirst, you felt when they were cold, hungry, tired, or just plain stressed out.    The only issue I have with the novel is that it seemed to be missing large chunks. There were whole sections of time that I would have loved to read about. But from a realists view, adding these parts would have made the book so long as to make it unreadable. The story is complete and easy to follow; it simply leaves you with a desire to know more.    Armchair Interviews says: A very touching and beautiful story that draws you in with immediate connections with the characters and historical details that create a vivid and intricate background.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|Having seen the trailers and knowing something about Danny Boyle, I bought \\"Sunshine.\\" Mistake. The film was arguably THE worst sci fi film I've ever seen. Confused storyline, incomprehensible plot, stock characters (and one who appears from nowhere with no explanation of how he got onboard the Icarus), \\"standard\\" special effects, woefully inadequate (incompetent?) editing. A total waste of time, except for Cillian Murphy's performance, but even that couldn't save this cinematic disaster.     There is no chemistry between actors/characters, and the idea that the film delves into \\"philosophical dilemmas\\" is laughable.     Save your money. Save your brain. This flick is on a par with \\"Battlefield Earth.\\"
B000WPD2AS|5.0|This is a must-have collection specialy for Celine's fans.Great Christmas music and the holiday performance live in this DVD.I like the part where Celine visited Charlemagne and recalled her humble beginnings.The only thing is suggest/wished that the DVD covers from the entire concert and there was no cuts,although the highlights were there.If we watch any of Celine's performance,it should be to the max.Otherwise,DO NOT miss this collection.
0525950079|5.0|A great sequle World Without End takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge, two centuries after the townspeople finished building the exquisite Gothic cathedral that was at the heart of The Pillars of the Earth. Another must have to add to your collection.
0525950079|4.0|Having read The Pillars of The Earth only one week ago for the first time, the memory of the first book might be too fresh for me to render a fair comparison.<br />World Without End was absolutely a page turner with its endless twists and turns in a well detailed historical background. However, its predecessor was superior. Pillars was a more dramatic and breathtaking family saga with generations of its main characters going through their own heart felt losses and triumphs; Prior Phillip was a more nuanced and multi-façade character than the equally smart and capable Caris who was simply more career driven than anything else.  Jack was the more likable genius of the two builders with his utter and uncompromised devotion to Aliena compared to Merthin. The love story between Merthin and Caris overall was just not as romantic and fascinating . Their casual relationship, even though long lasting, didn't make my heart leap as it did for Jack and Aliena. Lastly, the good vs evil theme ran out of steam half way through when I was also getting a little sick with the never-ending ups and downs  (it could be just because that I already had  a big dosage of that from Pillars).<br />Having said that, I would still recommend this book to anyone who likes historical novels with intriguing characters and thrilling plots.

1580493904|4.0|I'll preface my comments by stating that I read this in anticipation of possibly teaching.  Having been a student of Postmodernity and Postcolonialism in Graduate School, I thought I'd grab ahold of Siddhartha and really just run with it.  Hesse's depiction of Siddhartha's journey into his inner peace and truth was fascinating, but leads one to feel that peace is a journey that is merely an apparition of one's beliefs at a given moment.  Having said that though, I don't want to make my review about philosophies and not writing, so I'll stick to Hesse's writing and story.  Overall, I found it fascinating, but in the end, I have gained much more understanding of contemporary issues into eastern philosophy through more Booker Prize winners and their approaches to fundamental questions of life.  Also, Booker Prize winners tend to be authors from the culture they write of.  Please don't get me wrong here, I enjoyed Siddhartha, but might choose something less sophisticated in its philosophies for my own students.
1563890119|5.0|My experience with graphic novels has been regrettably limited, and after hearing rave reviews from friends and reading extensive praise for the series online, I decided to take the plunge.<br /><br />Graphic novels are sadly overlooked and not considered literature by most critics, shrugged off as nerdy pubescent obsessions or erotic adult fetishes. While this can be true (at least in my limited experience), there are a number of wonderfully complex, bitingly intelligent, metaphorical graphic novels...and The Sandman is certainly one of the elite.<br /><br />Boy, am I ever glad I finally read this classic work of art and literature.<br /><br />While I haven't (yet) read any of the following volumes, Preludes and Nocturnes is the one novel that can be read as a standalone as it marks the beginning of the series, and has a conclusive ending (although you would be mad not to want to read the subsequent volumes after devouring this).<br /><br />The novel is divided up into separate stories/chapters that seemingly jump around and are unrelated at first glance, but eventually tie together nicely as the story progresses. The tale is simple, with mythological roots.It is a quest story of a lost hero, stranded from his home, who undertakes a quest to regain his power and his throne. Enslaved by greedy humans who aimed to capture his sister, Death, Dream (or Morpheus) spends years waiting for his inevitable escape, and revenge. Once freed of his prison, Dream is terrifying. More the stuff of nightmares, he is imagined beautifully in bold dark ink and burning red eyes. After exacting revenge on the son of his captor--the man responsible for his imprisonment long dead--Dream begins his search for the three tools he needs to regain his throne: a bag of sand (a reserve of dreamstuff and power), his helm (the symbol of his monarch), and his ruby (the dreamstone which contains a piece of Dream's soul and source of his power).<br /><br />The quest for three objects leads Morpheus down three different paths. Things have fallen apart since Dream has been trapped--people slipping into constant, unwaking slumber, the kingdom falling apart, and strange behavior at every turn (an exchange between brothers Cain and Abel demonstrates this strangeness pretty effectively). Through consulting the Weird Sisters (the mythological three Fates), Dream discovers where to find his lost symbols of power. For the Bag of Sand, he travels to London and enlists the aid of John Constantine. Vanquishing wild dreams and renegade nightmares, Morpheus regains the bag and is strong enough to search for his helm. The helmet is possessed by a Demon in Hell--where Dream travels, and discovers Lucifer Morningstar is now part of a triumvirate that governs the kingdom, along with Beelzebub and Azazel. He must battle the lesser Demon for the return of his helm, which is carried out in stunning fashion, both in the art on the page, and in Mr. Gaiman's flowing prose. For the last symbol of power, Dream looks to the Justice League for information, and faces a demented Doctor Destiny who has been using the ruby for his own twisted purposes.<br /><br />The novel is rich in metaphor and allusion, drawing heavily on Greek myths and folklore (as is Mr. Gaiman's hallmark), which is woven seamlessly into story and art. Dream transitions from an enraged and terrifying thing of power and smoke portrayed through jagged, harsh black lines and deathly pale skin, to a being more tangible and human. By the last chapter of the novel, ironically when he has at long last regained all his power and glory, Dream looks more like a sulking emo kid than an awesome Prince of Shadow. It is this transition, and the ability to make something as abstract as dreams become accessible and personified, that astonishes and awes the reader.<br /><br />My two favorite stories/chapters are \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\" and \\"24 Hours\\". Death, Dream's beautiful big sister, is introduced in \\"The Sound of Her Wings\\". And like all elder siblings, Death chides and scolds Dream for wallowing in self-pity and reminds him to fulfill his responsibilities. Contrary to popular depictions of Death as a morbid, chilling presence, this personification is perky, charming, and sympathetic--and so very cool, as other reviewers have stated. In \\"24 Hours\\", John Dee (aka Dr. Destiny) has regained control of Morpheus' Dreamstone Ruby, and has twisted and corrupted its power to suit his own dark purposes. This chapter is truly horrific, as chaos is unleashed upon the world and in a microcosm through a small diner that Dee has taken hostage. It is deliciously creepy.<br /><br />I loved the DC crossovers in this volume (although from what I can garner from reviews here, this isn't a popular reaction). At the very least, if you are familiar with some older DC comics, Preludes and Nocturnes allows you a frame of reference to familiarize yourself with. For my part, I was delighted to see Constantine, Green Lantern, Scarecrow, the shoutouts to the Justice League of America, and even a setting in Arkham Asylum.<br /><br />Truly, this novel is wonderful, and should be read by all--not just by fans of graphic novels, but by anyone even remotely interested in literature. My only regret is that it took me so long to find and read this work.<br /><br />Review courtesy of TheBookSmugglers.blogspotr wallowing in self-pity and reminds him to fulfill his responsibilities.

0321213351|5.0|A master-piece and a must-read art-work. When I was studying on Martin Fowler's Refactoring to make my code more comprehensive and improve its clarification, I see, Martin Fowler's techiques are generalized techniques, I found Joshua Kerievsky's techiques in Refactoring to Patterns are more specific techiques concern of purely Design Patterns. While Design Patterns itself high-level abstracted, it is easy to find concrete examples in Recfactoring to Patterns and that makes programmer easy to understand Design Patterns. Special thanks to Joshua Kerievsky and to his study group for a this kind of work.

B00005LC1H|5.0|I grew up watching old episodes of Fawlty Towers on PBS with my dad.<br /><br />I got this as a gift a few years ago and have watched them over and over again.  We continually quote lines from this show as we're doing things together even to this day.<br /><br />I decided to replace my dad's VHS tapes this year (2007) for Christmas. He has had them for about 15 years or so, so they are pretty worn out.  He was really happy to get this.  Now we can revive some of our daily quotes to each other as we talk on the phone or when I visit their house.<br /><br />It's too bad that BBC only made 12 episodes.  This could've been as great and well known as Monty Python had it continued for a few more years.<br /><br />The DVDs are great quality.  There are a lot of interviews with the cast and behind the scenes looks at how this show came about.  I actually couldn't find it in stock in any stores in my area (Portland, Oregon)...no one bothers to carry this great show anymore!!!  Not Best Buy, Target, Fred Meyer, Borders, or Suncoast Movie Company.  Thank you Amazon!<br /><br />\\"This Basil's wife.  This Basil.  This smack on head.\\"

The swivel sweeper is great (and I have bought a bunch of cleaning items that don't work and I still wish I had a magic wand that would just sweep all this mess away.)    I am in my late 60's, have 2 cats and with 2 hip and 2 back surgeries, I can't bend over to sweep so this item is great for picking up loose litter, paper scraps from my shredder, etc., etc. I love it!

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Ill give a short one anyways. Amazing is about the only word that could sum this up. Everything about it is incredible. The best part, besides the overall thing, the parts that you will appreciate the most, is the planet earth diaries at the end of each segment. This a is detailed account of how some of the shots were made, and how difficult or rare some of the shots were to make. The cave section with the mile high moutain of bat guano stands out in my mind, and will in yours after you see what they had to go through to get it the way they wanted it to be portrayed.     Thats it, buy it, enjoy it, it is well worth what I consider a cheap cost for something so amazing.
0618680004|1.0|I'm not making this up! I read this book in order to learn from an atheist \\"expert\\".  But I was disappointed to find a lot of circular reasoning and very little scientific or logical argument against religion.<br /><br />Yes, I grew up in church and have seen, first-hand, the damage that can be done by misdirected or outright evil leaders and ignorant followers. HOWEVER, this book does not appear to be objective or logical in it's argument.  In fact, rather than seeking truth, which would have been the better approach, Dawkins is obviously setting out to \\"convert\\".  Of course religion does the same, but he is using the same tactics that are used in the very religions he is criticizing.
140120306X|5.0|Although this publication is nearly two-years late in being released, it is another exceptional piece of work from Southhampton's, Alan Moore.  Filling in details of the many different 'Leagues' that have banded together to aid Great Britain and her allies in times of need, The Black Dossier resides within the vaults of MI5 and is about to be stolen.  Join Ms Murray and Mr Quatermain as they try to stay ahead of their persuers in the 'litarary' Britain of 1958.  This tale is punctuated by historical sections detailing other escapades but written, and published, in a style that befits the setting.    This book does not reach the jaw dropping heights of the first two volumes, but only because of its different take on the subjects.  Kevin O'Neil's artwork is once again perfectly suited for the tale and Mr Moore has does a fine job of weaving the 'seemingly' disjointed sections together (they make more sense than other reviewers are giving them credit).    The book is well bound, and even the 3D insert (complete with glasses) is a little bit less of the gimmick we're used to and adds to the fantastical nature of the ending.    The main complaint this book has been getting is that it's not like the first two volumes - but you should know that from the title!  So if you want more of the same, wait for volume three, but if you want something different, challenging, and ultimately more rewarding, then read The Black Dossier.    Love & Peas, Peej
B0009A40ES|1.0|American Psycho starring Christian Bale is just pure garbage! This film tries so hard to be edgy, provocative, and clever but the director fails to achieve any kind of dark humor. Reese Witherspoon plays against type and even though Bale is a talented actor, I just feel this role doesn't do anything for him. There are some graphic and grotesque images in American Psycho, not for the faint of heart. I just couldn't stand this movie, pretty ordinary.

B0010ZR160|5.0|This is a confident and assured directing-debut for Ben Affleck. He has proven to be a good screenwriter (he co-wrote this one, as well as the Oscar-winning script to GOOD WILL HUNTING), but has been prett spotty as an actor. Sometimes his choices were poor and sometimes his performances too. He is obviously very intelligent and capable...but that doesn't always come through in his performances.     With GONE BABY GONE, filmed in Affleck's beloved and familiar Boston...he has established himself as an outstanding director. There aren't any fancy tricks or special-effects here. Just an understanding of how to set mood and how to give good actors space to operate.     The movie (based on the novel by Dennis Lenhane, who also wrote MYSTIC RIVER) tells the story of two low-rent private eyes (Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan) who are hired by grieving relatives to help the police in their search for a 4 year old missing girl. The belief is that people who won't talk to the police will talk to them. This proves to be an astute assumption, as the two investigators (who are also a loving couple) quickly make headway.     Regulations apparently compel the police to cooperate, so two veteran detectives (Ed Harris and John Ralston) assist the couple in their work...and vice versa. I liked the fact that there was tension between the two groups (which we certainly come to expect when we see similar scenarios in movies) but it fairly rapidly is lightened when it becomes clear that the two private eyes are actually making progress and the two cops are actually willing to act on this information and to take some risks themselves.     I'm going to leave the plot there...suffice it to say that no one is quite who they appear to be. It is an intersting and surprise-packed story on the surface...and that's almost good enough...just watching the case unfold and the twists get revealed. But what earns this film an extra star is the moral and ethical tale just beneath the surface. These characters grapple with moral choices, and the movie shows over and over that our consciences and religious beliefs may be tightly held and admirably adhered to...but they can nonetheless get us into serious trouble. As viewers, we understand fairly clearly what we think everyone OUGHT to do...but we also feel the pain of internal conflict when they don't. Because we understand their internal battles. And we also feel for them when they live with the consequences of their prideful stubborness. Doing the right thing isn't cut and dried in this film at all.     Pretty much everyone in the film does great work. Special mention should go to Casey Affleck, an actor that I've pretty much paid no attention to. Well, he's having a great year (with this film and THE ASSASINATION OF JESSE JAMES...) and he's an interesting performer. Unconventional looking and seemingly a little slow and sleepy-eyed...his character bursts forth with shocking actions and bravery. He uses bluster to get out of sticky situations...but you can also easily tell that he's probably quivering in his boots at the same time.     The film isn't perfect. Michelle Monaghan's character is both underwritten and underplayed. I think this movie stretched her skills just past her breaking point. She isn't awful...but I was distracted by her lack of convincing reactions in many scenes. And a couple of brief flashback scenes go by SO quickly, and they're so important, that I think I may have missed a couple of minor points of plot developments.     Quibbles aside...this is a stirring, adult, thought-provoking, well-acted, well-written and SURPRISE, well-directed thriller. I HIGHLY recommend it.
1582701709|1.0|The \\"secret\\" to why this book has been a smashing success is evidence of the notion that all people seek answers and long for Hope.  This book certainly offers both, but one must question what rational, measurable foundation do the claims of the book rest upon? The author frames an assertion, The Law of Attraction for example, and then selectively draws upon notable individuals from history and so-called experts of today to in fashion or another validate her assertion.  By framing an assertion that \\"like attracts like\\" and carefully taking experiences of noteworthy individuals out of the history books, and interviewing \\"experts\\" with exceedingly dubious self-awarded titles, Ms. Byrne makes the impressive leap from her rather silly hypotheses to laws or truths. Fascinating how her assertions are dubbed \\"Laws\\" versus more sensible alternatives such as \\"principles\\" or \\"theories.\\"      While one could fill pages analyzing the faulty and misguided advice and examples pervasive throughout the entire book, the one fact that all would-be readers should know is that \\"The Secret\\" has no new truths, contains merely recycled ideas and is but an individual's well-packaged, glitzy and smoothly marketed pamphlet of her opinion of the world.  Descartes' timeless statement that is in itself the source of countless subsequent discourses and books, \\"I think therefore I am\\", predates Ms. Byrne's glamorous media-bundle by some 370 years.  Even Descartes' conclusion is itself just a manifestation of man's own opinion and theory of how he fits in this world and what constitutes reality. Ms. Byrne merely incorporates in Eastern religious perspectives and opines that we have the power to shape the Universe by the power of our minds, while skipping the philosophical syllogisms Descartes more keenly built his assertions on in his works.    While I would grant that if you distill out some of the more reasonable statements out of this book, one can collect some general principles that can aid in bettering your circumstances and overcoming adversity, I would suggest approaching the book with a critical mind and actually considering the worldview and \\"Laws\\" that are asserted as truth.  The less discerning reader may draw inspiration that we have some mystical power ready within us that if we just think and feel and imagine enough this power can be released to work wonders.  Surely a \\"feel-good\\" sentiment.  However, under a more critical lens, the reader should uncover the volume as nothing more than a brochure on neo-Eastern mysticism parading interesting statements and surprisingly odd conclusions as \\"The Truth.\\"    Yes, the book gladly supplies answers and manufactures a storehouse of ideas that can be mistaken for Hope, but what are we left with in the afterglow of an enticing DVD production and an artful book cover that decorates our bookshelf?  -- empty and fruitless words that sell ultimate happiness but sow only fading suppositions that wither away in the end.  There is genuine Truth to be known, but Ms. Byrne and her expert panel consisting generally of eccentrics do nothing more than offer burlap clothing when there is cashmere to be worn.

B00104W8T6|4.0|\\"Juno\\" is the little indie movie that could, for this year -- an enchantingly witty story about a teenage girl who gets pregnant, and the smart decisions she has to make for everyone's sakes.<br /><br />It's a smart, sweet, poignantly funny little movie, and that gets echoed in the \\"Juno\\" soundtrack. Like many a soundtrack over the past few years, it's got a great assortment of artists -- everything from classic rockers to Scottish mope-popsters. It's a warm folky little affair that leaves you with a wistful little smile at the end.<br /><br />\\"If I was a flower growing wild and free/all I'd want is you to be my sweet honeybee/And if I was a tree growing tall and green/all I'd want is you to shade me and be my leaves,\\" Barry Louis Polisar warbles over a strummed guitar and spurts of harmonica. For the record, this kind of music usually gives me hives, but the cheerful, fun flavour of it somehow made it palatable.<br /><br />After a \\"doo-doo-doo\\" interlude by Kimya Dawson, the soundtrack bounces into the sprightly Kinks tune \\"A Well Respected Man.\\" From there, the soundtrack slips smoothly into a series of folky pop tunes -- Buddy Holly's mellow \\"Dearest,\\" a Mateo Messina song that is basically one minute of strummed guitar, Cat Power's poignant little folk ballad, Antsy Pants' bouncy little pop tunes (\\"I am a vampire! I am a vampire!\\"), and the Moldy Peaches' countryish \\"Anyone Else But You.\\"<br /><br />Kimya Dawson is the overpowering influence in this soundtrack -- including the \\"doo-doo-doo\\" interlude, she contributes five songs of rambling, quirky pop (\\"I was quiet as a mouse/when I snuck into your house/and smoked roofies with your spouse...\\"). But there are some more rock'n'roll moments -- the ringing fuzz-folk of Sonic Youth, Belle and Sebastian's trumpety guitarpop, and the Velvet Underground's romantic, gentle pianopop tune \\"I'm Sticking With You.\\"<br /><br />And there's a sweet little epilogue to this -- stars Ellen Page and Michael Cera sing a cute little lo-fi duet at the end (\\"You're a part time lover/and a full time friend...\\" \\"Here is the church/and here is the steeple/we sure are cute for two ugly people\\"). It's as adorable as their onscreen relationship.<br /><br />A lot of movies -- both major films and little bitty ones -- have indie-rock soundtracks now, usually mingling old favorites with newer bands and artists. But the \\"Juno\\" soundtrack is a bit different from the average soundtrack -- it relies on the songs meshing together into a tapestry of folkpop, rather than a string of solid, individual songs.<br /><br />Most of the songs mostly rely on acoustic guitar -- they can be sprightly, quirky, flickering, countryish, mellow, lazy, caressing or vaguely Spanishy. But some of these artists mix in trumpets, piano, drums, ringing electric guitar and in one Kimya Dawson song, a whistle. And the Mott the Hoople song \\"All The Young Dudes\\" has a soaring organ/keyboard combo that really stands out among the softer songs.<br /><br />And these songs are good choices for other reasons -- Polisar's voice is rather nasal, but the others tend to be mellow and rich.

It took them over two weeks to notify me that they would NOT be restocking.    I went even further to order this album of off a certain private seller on this site. I ordered it on December the 16th, and was told it was mailed out on December the 18th with an expected delivery date being either December 24 or just after the 25th.    As of writing this the album still has to arrived and I am seeking a refund/replacement.    Now I saw them Play twice while they were on tour in the US. Once in Berkeley back in July of 2007, then again in Las Vegas in October of 2007.    I'm about to just give up and get the 'normal' album. It seems the US market really gets the shaft when it comes to Daft Punk's Media. (go look for Electroma in US, Amazon only had it for sale on the web for barely a week or so)

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I'm now listening to this CD for the third time this morning, and I'm a little angry that it is so good I have to stop working and spit out yet another fanboy review of Continuum (don't worry, it will be short.)    There are already a gazillion \\"This is great\\" reviews so I'll just add that it's more bluesy than his previous offerings, and that this is some of the most emotionaly moving music I think I have ever heard.  \\"Stop this Train\\" and \\"Dreaming with a Broken Heart\\" have both almost brought me to tears twice today.    This young twerp is such an amazing instrumentalist and songwriter that I just want to pinch his head off.  I don't want to scare off the young crowd, but I will strongly endorse this as a representative of the Affilliation of Almost Old Farts (39 y/o).    Bah, back to work.
B000002542|5.0|The only Journey albums I own are the first four--yeah, I know Infinity has Steve Perry's overpowering vocals but it is a very musical album and I have to admit it grabs me-(especially Neil Schon's solo on Winds of March)..........but this album is a tribute to the brilliant musicianship of Journey. The rhythm section is as solid as they come and Neil Schon's solos make the music soar into space (like the album cover)......Kahoutek is a good example of these guys giving it all they got....Aynsley Dunbar can really lay it down.....the vocals on this album are so much less obtrusive than during the Perry phase,,,and Greg Rolie has a good voice to complement this material.......a good balance of vocals to music.........wholeheartedly recommended.
B00110WFZ6|5.0|When the first film in the epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, \\"The Two Towers.\\" Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?<br /><br />Fortunately moviegoers only had to wait a year for the answer, when \\"The Two Towers\\" debuted in December 2002. The second part of Peter Jackson's astounding adaptation lacks the surprise of the first movie, but it continues the strong storytelling, amazing acting, and one of the greatest battles of the silver screen.<br /><br />The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted.<br /><br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth. It's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.<br /><br />This film is much darker than the first movie, although we still get some funny moments from Gollum and the hobbits, but some creepy ones as well. Gollum/Smeagol's argument with himself is absolutely chilling. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard. The scripting is impeccable, mixing the funny moments (\\"Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!\\" Pippin wails when a \\"tree\\" speaks to them) with the dramatic speeches, and ending with a simple, powerful speech by Sam.<br /><br />And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.<br /><br />Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, which is warping our dear hobbit out of his own mind. Sean Astin's performance grows as well, as he does whatever it takes to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths, whatever.<br /><br />But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too, including a love triangle involving Aragorn and the warrior-maid Eowyn, and Legolas and Gimli becoming best buddies (even competing to see who kills the most orcs). McKellen gets to play \\"Gandalf 2.0,\\" a less grumpy and wiser Gandalf, and movie veteran Christopher Lee gets more juicy scenes as the warped wizard Saruman.<br /><br />The journey continues in \\"The Two Towers,\\" crammed with so much action and pathos that it never has time to suffer from \\"middle chapter syndrome.\\" An amazing continuation.cluding the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller stories, like the hobbits befriending treelike ents and battling a wizard.

B000XA5K48|4.0|If your looking for a plot with intense acting and wonderful scenery move on...LOL.  This movie just hit my mood!  It was funny, kick [...] and raw!!  It had corny one liners that I still laughed at.  Clive Owen was tough, Paul Gaimatti's character was a freak and Monica Bellucci was cool and beautiful.      The movie almost had a \\"Sin City\\" feel to it....Dark. I'm buying it.  What a blast! It wasn't anything I thought it was going to be like, and I'm glad I rented it.
B000HWZ5VU|4.0|I gave just 4 stars only because I have in my ears two projects of Page&Plant (\\"No Quarter - Unledded\\", \\"Walking into Clarksdale\\") - almost Led Zeppelin. Despite this it's one of the best material given by Plant to his fans (don't forget \\"Principle of the Moment\\" and latest \\"Rising Sand\\"!). Slow Dancer sounds like old-good-and-its-best Led Zep! CD absolutelly worth to have!
B000PTYPAC|5.0|It's been years since I bought a CD that didn't have at least one song I wasn't crazy about.  I love EVERY song on this CD.  Hayley's voice is amazing and the whole band together is just phenomenal.    Miracle is my favorite song on the CD but as I said above, every song is terrific.    In this age of hip-hop, rap and \\"dance\\" music, this is the epitome of rock, in my opinion.
0375847227|5.0|This is an awesome book that I read. I loved it so much that I purchased a copy for my Mother-in-Law to read. Amazon was wonderful in how fast they were able to get it to me. In perfect time for the Holidays. I would have to give a Thumbs up all round for this order.
B000XUUQQK|3.0|the first was one of the worst movie ive ever seen so i rented this with hope of it being at least a little  entertaining. It was pretty well written and had alot of shock and awe. it was done by the people who have done the saw franchise so all i'll really say is if you liked saw you will enjoy this. It is nothin like the first bogeyman beleive me
B00005QY5Y|5.0|The cd finally arrived, but not befoe after Christmas. Amazon had an old address for me and I couldn't change it. When they finally cancelled the order, due to not being able to deliver it, I had to re-order and then the CD came.  This is the first time there has been any kind of snag in Amazon procedure. I'll keep dealing with them.
0316789798|5.0|I love this book.  I had this book as a child (in the 80's) and I was so excited to see that I could purchase one for my daughter.  My child is in pre-school and has been practicing drawing basic shapes.  Ed Emberley's book teaches children (and adults) how to draw animals by piecing together basic shapes such as squares, circles, triangles, etc.  The directions are easy to follow, and show you step-by-step how to combine different shapes into a final product.  I would recommend this book for any age group, from a child who is just learning to draw to an adult who loves to doodle.
B00006LLNV|5.0|A wonderful CD soundtrack filled with beautiful, festive south of the border selections from the movie Frida.  Now it can be a cinco de mayo celebration at my house any day!
B000P12LWY|4.0|A good cast, an interesting script, wonderful costumes but incredibly inaccurate history.  Such a shame as the accurate story is full of strength and drama of its own without changing it.  For example, the writer apparently used the name of Henry's second sister, Margaret, rather than the correct sister, Mary, as the producers felt it would confuse the average viewer using the same name for both his sister and daughter in the production!  Ah, yes, sorry, I forgot, only the ill educated watch the television nowerdays lolololol.  Hopefully, the production will encourage people to go online and learn a little of the real and wonderfully rich history of this period.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|they will have hours of fun with this movie...I'm sure this will be a classic.
B000FDFVZ6|5.0|This book was in great condition, as promised by the seller.  Arrived on time, no complaints!
0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for my 11 year old nephew for Xmas. I was so excited to give it to him. I had to stop my son from cracking open the book and looking at everything. It was packed with pictures and cool pop-ups. I talked to one of my son's teachers that bought the book for her 34 year old son who is a collector. Young or old, fanatic or not, this is an awesome book!
0143038419|4.0|This was a great Christmas gift I got. It is well written, great detail of scenery - makes you feel like you are traveling with Liz. Wonderful descriptions of her spiritual experiences! Although I thought the ending of each chapter was a bit abrupt (not as detailed as the rest), it still maintained the flow throghout the book. I can't wait to read her next work and see how she's doing today!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This DVD is beautiful, and it is a must have if you love nature.    The footage is clear and colorful and you feel like you are actually there, and this is just from watching the DVD on a regular DVD player. I hope to purchase an HD-DVD Player at some point and will probaby go back and purchase the High Definition set and pass this set on to my niece (well, her parents) so they can enjoy the show over.    My son is fascinated watching this series and I love the fact that he can forgo some cartoons and kid shows once in awhile and be entertained by this footage. Though he may not understand it all yet, the visuals are gripping.  (Make sure of course to watch the sections ahead of time, just to make sure it is okay for your child.  Each one is different and you should be the one to decide if a section could be skipped, there are one or two things I skipped at this time.  But despite that there are hours of engaging material for young and old alike.)
B00005LC1H|5.0|Basil Fawlty is truly a ghastly character.  Sybil and he are meant for each other.  Yet, they are so much fun to watch.  The cast of these classic sitcoms are so much fun--especially Manuel.  The slapstick involving Manuel is \\"roll on the floor\\" funny!  I keep asking myself why they made so few episodes, and it is really difficult to choose a favorite.  They are all hysterically funny.  However, please take note--don't ever stay in a hotel like Fawlty Towers!  Ha!
B000J103PC|4.0|I had seen it before, but wanted to share it with my husband.  He enjoyed it.

B000VAQX0A|5.0|I am basing my review on the new MOFI release.  For more information google mofi then go to their web site    Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab has been the undisputed pioneer and leader in audiophile recordings since the company's inception in 1977.    Based on the image they are showing.  This is the new Permanent Waves Ultradisc II(tm) 24 KT Gold CD    This is RUSH and a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab remaster = an instant collectors item and must have for any serious RUSH fan.    They have also released a Permanent Waves GAIN 2(tm) Ultra Analog 180g LP    The only thing I question is why CDNOW is calling this a box set?    Box Set = multiple disks
1594489505|5.0|A Must Read....Unforgettable. A womans struggle to survive in a world that offers her nothing.
B000000WGL|5.0|I bought this CD back in 1989, and it is Keith's best solo studio album. Who ever knew that Keith vocally could carry a whole album? He's joined by a stellar cast of musicians : WADDY WACHTEL, IVAN NEVILLE, STEVE JORDAN, and guest vocalist SARAH DASH [ formerly of Labelle ] really adds to this album vocally. I especially like ROCK AWHILE which has some great hooks & gritty vocals from Keith & Sarah, as well as the Memphis style horns on the duet [ ! ] between Keith & Sarah Dash, as well as the opening cut BIG ENOUGH, WHIP IT UP, TAKE IT SO HARD. Gritty, growling Keith & company with lots of R&B influences on this CD. He took this band out on the road to do this material live, & I highly recommend the LIVE AT THE HOLLYWOOD PALLADIUM , which has many of these songs live as well as the Stones' CONNECTION , and a torrid version of TIME IS ON MY SIDE sung by Sarah Dash.
0375847227|5.0|I bought this book for me, and the same trilogy for my sister but the set of 3 seperate books. Comparing the two, I probably would have liked the set of 3 books better because the omibus is rather large. The binding is great and all, but I worry carrying it around that I'm going to ruin the cover and bend the pages. If you're reading it at home, then this is a nice one to get. I can't comment on the story itself because I haven't finished reading it, but what I have read, I love it. The story is interesting and when I have to put it down, I'm always trying to figure out the mystery. I highly recommend this trilogy but choose the set that works best for you. If you read on the go, get the individual books in a set. If you read at home, this would be a good one to get.
0786838655|5.0|in the tale of The Lighting Thief,by rick riordan, we find our hero Perseus jackson, or percy, in the city of new york. After an attack from his algebra teacher who for some reason no one seems to remember, Percy starts to realize more and more weird things happening in his life. as if finding out his best friend was half goat one day wasnt bad enough, that very same night percy gets in to a battle with a minotaur killing his mom, and almost himself. after forcing himself to realize whats happening around him, and that he really is the son of poseidon, he is sent on a quest to retrieve Zeus' mysteriously stolen master bolt, and traveling to the underworld for his own intentions to save his mom. fighting monsters and gods along the way this is not an easy task for percy or his friends. in the first of the series of percy jackson and the olympians percy needs to stop an explosion from a bolt that would make a hydrogen bomb look like a fire cracker, and try to stop a war between the gods that would deystroy the world. this is a great tale of action, suspense, and thills. i would highly recomend the lightning thief.
B00008BRB5|5.0|To my ears this is the pinnacle of The Police's recorded output.  I really think every song here is great and the title track \\"Synchronicity II\\" remains my all time favorite Police composition, and some of the best lyrics Sting has ever written.  Everything comes together on this disc as The Police don't stick to a formula but continue to evolve their sound into what would unfortunately become their final album.  More huge, huge hits came from this one including one of their biggest \\"Every Breath You Take\\", a song that many people took for a love song, but really contains a much darker sinister plot.  The Police had become a football stadium band by the time this album came out and could literally play any size venue that they wanted.  They truly went out at the top of their game with their best album and most successful tour.  It is good to have them back on the road again in 2007.
B00007E7K0|5.0|It's just a camera lens cap...so it was what I expected.  I received it quickly witout any issues.
B000000WJ2|3.0|I was disappointed with this 2nd solo album from Keith, especially since his first TALK IS CHAEP and the LIVE AT THE HOLLYWOOD PALLADIUM were such strong sets. Not as many great songs or lyrics. It shows Keith's lazy side, 'cause it could have been better. Same musicians as on the first. Sarah Dash is underutilized on this CD, appearing only on BODY TALK. Too bad ' cause her upfront vocals on TALK IS CHEAP and the LIVE CD's really brought out extra layers of needed soulfulness & excitement that made Keith's voice more listenable. Worth a listen, not really bad at all , but not that great.
0440238609|5.0|I cannot review the actual story because I haven't finished reading it yet but from what I have read, I love it. I bought this set for my sister for her birthday and she loves it. She has completed the first book and continues to read the series. I bought the omnibus for me and comparing the two, I would recommend this set. The omnibus is really too big to carry around. I worry that dragging it around will ruin the cover or bend the pages. I highly recommend this set.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a Science Fiction book written by Lois Lowry. It is set in a future society where you may not control any thing in your community; including your life. This society has no almost no pain and no emotions.    When al the \\"11's\\" turn to \\"12's\\", they get their life assignment. They range from many things. The main character Jonas, 12, is given the job title receiver. Jonas receives memories from a man called The Giver. The Giver stores old memories from past times. He holds memories of pain, anger, and love. He holds these memories in case the Elders of the community need help in making decisions that they don't know how to handle.     As Jonas receives these memories, he feels more and more pain. He sees how much his community has changed into a more diabolic place to live. He sees what all the people in his community have done to change the lives of people and how the world works.     If you love science fiction or love Lois Lowry then you should love this book. The Giver will keep you turning pages until the very end.

1844137864|5.0|Banksy is fabulous! This book showcases his work and gives insight to his views. He's a rebel with a cause. If you are interested in an innovative form of art expression and how it can make an inpact, you would like this book. A thought provoking book.
0743216385|4.0|Bought this book for my grandfather, a Paratrooper...and he really enjoyed this book. I would have given it 5 stars, but I didn't read it myself.
0446310786|5.0|A popular classic is one way to describe the awesome novel To Kill a Mockingbird. Everybody should read this novel because it is so interesting and it really is important. And a bonus- IT'S NOT BORING! Which is good because usually it seems books that are required reading are kind of boring. But not To Kill a Mockingbird.   The novel takes place in a small fictional southern town called Maycomb, Alabama set during the depression. A family lives there that consists of a widowed father, Atticus Finch, an older brother, Jem Finch, and a younger girl named Scout Finch. The father is a lawyer and he takes on a case about an African American man who has supposedly raped a white girl. Not to give away the ending I have to stop my summary there. But the book goes on about a detailed trial of the man. Another subject the story talks about is the Finch's neighbor- Boo Radley. He is a mysterious man who never comes out of his house and has terrible rumors going around about him. Scout and Jem and a friend they make named Dill make it their mission to see Boo.   The only downer to the novel is that the beginning doesn't make much sense. But don't stop because the end brings it all together. I hope you enjoy the novel if you decide to read it! Happy reading!
B000W4KT6E|5.0|I purchased the dvd \\"Hairspray\\" for my daughter for Christmas.  She watched at home and brought it to me for me to watch. This is an excellent show and had good service from Amazon in getting it to me.
0375842381|3.0|After having heard about a movie is coming up about \\"The Golden Compass\\" I'd liked to read the book(s) first. Not having seen the picture yet, I prefer the first part of the trilogy. Pullman wrote a fascinating and enthralling progression so I was quite excited to get to the second part of the story. It started exactly as I mentioned but after the first half the novel got long drawn out. Even so starts the third part \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" where in my opinion the story is overthrown in the respect of too much sense of wonder describing for example the diamond-legged \\"people\\". All'n'all I would recommend this trilogy for readers who like fantasy, thrill and unobvious solutions until the end of the story. Therefore I would recommend \\"His Dark Materials\\" for long winter-eves.
B000N75SNO|1.0|Total Mis-representation of the Product! Product pictured is premium quality with chain and googley eyes - product received was cheapy felt knock off! I ordered 3 of these for Christmas presents. They took forever to ship and when I received them I was sooo bummed at the poor quality and embarrassed to give them as gifts. This vendor was not the only one to mis-represent this same product! Shame on you, Amazon.
B000URDEB0|4.0|Different with the new singer.  Sounds a lot like Within Temptation now.  Tunes are good though and worth the money.  My favorite song on the CD is Last of the Wilds.  It is probably the best Celtic rocker I have ever heard.  The CD gets better every time I listen to it.  I hope they do more music like this one!

B000ZLFALI|4.0|A new Yellow Submarine has arrived on the back of Sargent Pepper's band?<br />Only that the music isn't original makes me stop at 4 stars.<br />The original music was 5 stars. This plot is 4 stars for star crossed lovers. My friend Jon from Liverpool joined the Marines, so he could be a citizen: he lost his ear in Vietnam. I lost friends and lovers in that war,<br />but the music lives on.<br />We have a new generation caught / cut by a new war that is changing<br />our universe...
B00005JMEW|5.0|I enjoyed the movie but it is pretty bloody. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with a weak stomach and definately not for children under 16.
B00005JKC3|5.0|While the title of best comic book adapation may be a toss up between the recent Spiderman 2 and the much older Tim Burton Batman original, this movie ranks in the top 5. Mature in its tone. Grand in its use of special of effects (the transition shots in this movie are awesome). The film is utimately marred by its lax editing. By the time the finale comes around (and it is an amazing one people), most casual viewers might be already exhausted.
B00005R2IS|5.0|A true action movie with Mel Gibson as \\" vigilante \\" after the death of his wife and son by mad bikers : truly a masterpiece !
0441172717|5.0|Dune is... awesome. A comeplete future universe, created and presented to the reader, with all of the little things present - histories, and how those historic events shaped the universe that the story must take place in.    The first book is a must-read for any sci-fi fan, or even someone who is just facinated by cultural anthropology.
B0009F2EPU|4.0|My main reason for reviewing this is to criticize the Amazon sin-opsis given on this page.  The references to Nazism are completely out of place. please, save this for some secret meeting somewhere. Sure, I'm aware of Wagner's \\"jews in Music\\" and whatnot. But Jesus didn't cause the Hundred Years War, did he?  I don't know, maybe he did.  Basically, I think the review is slightly objective but too whiny and cranky little baby stuff...\\"oh, siegfried didn't ask the dragon's permission to kill it\\" boo-hoo....When will it ever end?  And why mix in the 'racial purity' joke about the incest element?  That isn't funny to me, because it is completely out of line with the scenario. The incest has nothing to do with the supposed Nazi blood purity schlogg. Okay, Parsifal definitely has some overtones in that direction.  but the incest is more about proto-alchemical manifestations of the sub-kawnshiss....anyway. I really dig this video, never saw it on DVD...and this official Amazon review was pretty insulting, It's writer is probably a real whining dish rag
0143038419|4.0|I was given this book by a friend, and enjoyed it. It's the whole \\"I got depressed, life wasn't working out, I ran away from my troubles and learned something about life\\" type of story. A feel gooder if you're in that type of situation.
B000WC3864|4.0|anchor bay has released 'evil dead' more times than you can throw a quivering severed demon limb at, so why did i pick up the ultimate edition? a few reasons. number one, the packaging is incredible. it's well-made and the cover is the original poster art complete with fold marks (artificial or not, i don't know or care). two, i do not hold out any hope for a future edition that includes the well-known short 'within the woods' that raimi and crew made prior to 'evil dead' (bruce campbell has said in many interviews they will never release this, and it's very easy to find online for anyone who is curious). three, and probably most important, the 'ladies of the evil dead' disc! at long last, the female leads come forward and share their experience making this landmark film. they have a truckload of new and interesting stories to tell, and i loved watching all the footage of them together after all these years. if there is a future edition that features a commentary track by these ladies, i'll buy it (reference to a commentary is made in one of their interviews, but it's not specified whether or not it was for dvd or if they did it live at a public screening). they're awesome and frankly all we've heard for the last 20something years on this film series is male perspective. anchor bay was smart to seriously acknowledge the female contributors to this classic film as they make up the majority of the lead roles and endured the same pain and makeup torture as everybody else.<br /><br />my only complaint, and the reason this edition gets 4 stars instead of 5, is that i can't give away my previous 'collectors edition' anchor bay dvd of 'evil dead' because they put bruce campbell's commentary on a separate disc from the one with sam raimi and rob tapert. if anything happens to one of these two discs you still have the movie but you'd be missing one very important commentary track.

Clive Owen is one of my favorite actors and Monica Bellucci is just plain hot. But this movie just seemed to miss the mark somehow, some way. The action was completely over the top and ridiculous which it was suppose to be but it really didn't get me going. It was just missing something. And there was plenty of over the top wild stuff that was suppose to be funny but just really wasn't. Owen usually can pull off some funny stuff. I liked his reaction to things that annoyed him but it just wasn't enough. I can't put my finger on it but this movie just was not 'on' and was missing something.
B00005V1B2|5.0|It's a great album, a music which reminds me fantasy, creativeness  and the great skill of bands like king crimson, van der graaf  generator, soft machine, genesis, yes, elp, jethro tull, each one with their own sound and huge music knowledge...
B000Y7U98C|5.0|The keystone to Sunshine is the fact that once you strip away the sci-fi coveralls the film is essentially about a handful of people under very extreme circumstances. The central problem with extended space travel is the fact that after a year shoved into close quarters on a space aged Winnebago everyone is going to hate the guy next to him. I think 2001 had it right where they froze half the crew and made certain the remaining two had zero personality.    Apparently the same psychiatrists who okayed Lisa Nowak also approved the unhinged crew of Icarus II, whose mission is to reignite the dying sun. The ships psychiatrist has an unusual obsession with being \\"enveloped\\" by the sun on the ship's observation deck, the ships botanist, played by Michelle Yeoh, has an unhealthy connection to plants, and the ships diametric young males, Capa (Cillian Murphy) and Mace (Chris Evans) get into a tussle without an apparent provocation. In their defense they've been living shoulder to shoulder for a few years now, and despite the inherent tension, each crew member acknowledges that everything else, especially their lives, is second to delivering the ship's payload to the sun's surface, thus reigniting our dying star and saving the human race.    As expected from a Danny Boyle film, sci-fi is used as a jumping board for some philosophical musings as well as some overwhelming visuals. The guys behind the CGI of Transformers should probably be ashamed of themselves after they see what can be accomplished with a fraction of the budget. Sunshine is absolutely gorgeous and takes full advantage of its location within the orbit of Mercury.    Fans of science fiction will be able to tell which parts have been cobbled together from movies past, but while this at times is a drawback, it's still incredible what Boyle can do within the confines of genre filmmaking. Those who are looking for a tense thriller in the vacuum of space will be satisfied and those who want something more cerebral will be able to rack their brains. Whether you're a fan of Alien or Solaris, Boyle's latest film should please not simply because it knows it's working in the shadow of both but because it fully understands what made those films work and connects the dots between both kinds of science fiction.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  I have been a fan for a long time and this CD is great.  \\"River\\" is a beautiful song.  Love the whole CD.
0195170776|5.0|From the \\"final authority\\" in dictionaries worldwide (Oxford), comes this addition. It has really covered almost every word used in America. However, if you have to get known to the slangs, better to cmplement it with some American slang dictionary.  For everyday purpose, excellent one.
B000R7I3LY|3.0|While I do agree with the part of the Amazon review that says that there is a lot to like in this artist, I have a comment to make:    While Sara knows how to use her voice to good effect and actually does write intelligently (especially compared to the disaster that is the \\"young popular musicians scene\\" of today), I do feel that her piano playing is absolutely horrendous.  I'm not sure if she accompanies herself in an attempt to jump on the \\"if I show people that I can plunk out notes on a piano, they will automatically see me as a credible musician\\" train, or just because she likes to play.  Regardless, I think she should delve into some serious piano study if she intends to keep accompanying herself.  Another option would be for her to write out the piano part, but have a better-trained pianist actually play it.  It just grates on the ears a bit, for some of us....  Otherwise, though, she is a welcome artist to have around.  I'll take Sara Bareilles over the Rihanna/Mylie Cyrus/Ashlee Simpson/Jessica Simpson/Britney Spears musical train wreck any day.
B00004THAY|5.0|As amazing as you think it will be.  Buy this, then buy copies for your family.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I love this movie!  It is so much fun to watch, the songs are very catchy and fun, and it makes me smile every time I think about it.
0375842381|5.0|Wonderful collection!  My son (and myself, I must admit) have thouroughly enjoyed the books.  I am only distraught by the fact that I am half-way through the third book and realized that soon, the story will be over!  I recommend these books as an EXCELLENT teaching tool for children!  Good vs Evil has an interesting (and very pleasant) twist in these books.  Proves my theory that you don't have to be christian to be good - in fact, it's better NOT to be!
B00117P0HE|4.0|Wow, there are some people just complaining about download issues. I haven't had an issue yet. Chances are it's either your computer or it might just need to be reinstalled because my Unbox works great. As for the movie, it's fun to watch once but I think the die hard zombie fans will buy it. I was disappointed ONLY because the series strayed away from the horror part of it all which is what I LOVED about the 1st game. I was hoping the horror would be as present in the movies but it just wasn't there. Good action, parts that make you jump. I say it's worth a watch once.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Pink Floyd always sparks some magic and psychedelia laced elements in their sounds. What I have always considered two masterpiece albums were represented in this DVD. \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"Meddle\\" are two pivotal achievements in Floyds career. So in this DVD, when I heard \\"Fat Old Sun\\" done traditionally with Rick Wright's organ accompaniment, and \\"Echoes\\" treated with the same reverence, I was enthralled. And lets not forget the great Phil Manzanera, (of Roxy Music fame) on guitar, who in my estimation wasn't given enough spotlight. Robert Wyatt needed more time and substantive material as well. David Gilmour's guitar was, of course scorching. It would of been a real treat to see one of his lesser known works, like \\"The Narrow Way\\" from Umma Gumma. Oh well. The light show was awesome. Even the odd inclusion of David Crosby and Grahm Nash worked in its strange way. All in all, one of the best concert DVDs I have ever witnessed.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I saw this film in the theatre twice and loved it. This movie is more for the real science fiction fan than the casual fan- someone who would enjoy 'Solaris' or 'Silent Running' much more than 'Aliens vs Predator' or 'Starship Troopers.' The plot revolves around a small group of astronauts piloting a giant spaceship (Icarus II) that must deliver an immense nuclear bomb to the heart of the sun. Far in the future our son is dying. While in transit with their powerful payload they encounter many problems, including tensions with each other. That the previous mission (Icarus I)vanished mysteriously only adds more tension as the crew contemplates that most likely they are on a one way journey. Their loved ones and all of mankind are counting on them.<br /><br />The special effects are superb. The sets, futuristic yet spartan, are very convincing. The giant ship with it's thousands of polished mirrors to shield it from the sun is a special effects marvel. Director Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire) has crafted a truly enjoyable science fiction tale. This DVD features deleted scenes and an alternate ending. In the theatrical release the ending is the only part that dissapoints as the director goes for an ending more in line with what AVP fans would like. My suggestion check out the alternate ending. The movie is highly crafted and a great addition to your science fiction collection.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Fahrenheit 9/11    Documentaries lie on the continuum between fact and fiction. They attempt to recreate the known facts. You decide how well it is done. The opening says the following Interviews and Commentaries are for entertainment, the views and opinions belong to the individual speakers. The film starts by predicting a victory in Florida for Al Gore, then the networks change their projection and declare a Bush victory. Over what time span? [If Gore won his home state of Tennessee he would have been President.] Why did NO US Senator sign on to that petition? Was the fix in? People protested at the Inauguration. Bush was the vacationing President.    On September 11, 2001 two airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center towers. [Bush looks clueless after receiving the news.] The film asks whether Saudi money went to George W. when his father was President. Were there any other connections? What about the Carlyle Group? The attack on the WTC meant a larger military budget. There are connections between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family. Why did Bush use 9/11 as an excuse to attack Iraq? Can fear be used to scare people and justify government oppression? The FBI knew Al Qaeda had supporters in America who were taking flying lessons. Do Congressmen read the laws before they vote for them?    The film shows the \\"collateral damage\\" on the people of Iraq. Brittany Spears trusts Bush, why don't you? The Bush administration said there was no threat from Iraq in 2001. Was this a mistake? Is the high unemployment in parts of America a way to generate troops for the military? Then we see the invasion of a house in Iraq to find a suspect. \\"What did he do?\\" Why do they hate our troops in Iraq? Why did Bush try to cut wages and benefits for soldiers? Will the bombing of Iraq create business opportunities in rebuilding Iraq? Would Iraq be invaded if there was no oil? Should Congress ask their children to join the Army? These are all good questions.    There is a quotefrom George Orwell about the need for war to keep a ruling group in power. Orwell was a cynic, peace is more likely to keep a regime in power. A loss in war usually leads to regime change, as in 1952 and 1968. What about 2008? This film is sort of slow-paced, but that is the result of using facts and not staged events. It provides reports that you won't see on corporate television. After Reagan was elected he raised the lowest tax bracket from 9% to 15%. Social Security taxes were raised by 50%. This allowed the highest tax rate to be cut by 50%. Most people were taxed more so the wealthiest could be taxed less. Real wages fell as well. These economic policies led to today's recession. Can they be reversed?
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I remember the day I heard \\"The Story\\" sung by BC.  I stopped what I was doing and sat and listened beginning to end.  And thought to myself this song rocks.  What a great love song.  It had ummph!  She reminds me of many other favorite female singers.  k.d. lang, Indigo Girls, Patsy Cline, Sarah McLachlan.  Yet, BC has a unique style to her singing.  I think her voice is haunting and seductive and sweet.  Aside from her  big hits, the entire album holds a lot of other great songs.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This film should have won the best picture Oscar for its year.  Instead, the over-produced, over-done \\"Chicago\\" took the award for little reason.  This is one of the most absorbing films I have seen -- Polanski is at his finest and Adrien Brody is first-rate.  I honestly can think of no other film that held me for its entire length without letting go.  A triumph for everyone involved and a wonderful film for us to watch.  Do not let anyone tell you the ending if you have not seen it yet.  And the Chopin (that soaring, melodious, deeply involving emotional music) is heavenly.
0439882826|5.0|I bought this book for my son-in-law for chirstmas, he's a big star wars fan and he loved it. We were impressed with the book.
B000XA5K48|4.0|This action movie is just what the title promises 'shoot 'em up' plot with no end of blood in sight. I've never seen a carrot used as such a lethal weapon before. Some unique shots in this thriller, though a slightly strange story. A man named 'Smith' comes to the rescue of a pregnant woman he doesn't know, only to be left protecting the infant from the bad guys who have been hired to eliminate the child and anyone else who might have a clue about what their employer was doing. Very intense movie with a bit of humor on the side...<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
1401300529|5.0|Excellent book - fitting as Halberstam's last. Korea truly  was the \\"forgotten war\\", and the first one I came very close to being involved in. Lucked out, some of my peers didn't, some didn't return.  A good friend, a Marine,is still agitated because he was diverted, with his unit, from duty in Korea, to a stateside assignment. His timing would have placed him at \\"Frozen Chosin\\".   Halberstam's genius at interviewing and painting verbal pictures of his  subjects, many of them, is unexcelled.
1401207529|5.0|Text book definition of a perfect Batman comic. The art really complements the feel Frank Miller creates with his writing. Draws you in right from the start and doesnt let you go. It is as much a Jim Gordon story as it is a Bruce Wayne/Batman story but that is in no way a bad thing. Both stories intermix and become an incredible reading experience. The only negative comment is that it is only 4 comics and leaves you wanting more. But it is very well crafted and wanting more is no problem because I plan on reading it over and over again. An amazing read especially for the low Amazon.com price.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|One Republic is probably one of the best new artists out now. 'Apologize' is great but so is the rest of the album. I definitely recommend it. I love it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I had bought this movie more then once when this version came out. However I had to have it.  I was not disapointed...I was so happy to have it in it's color version that the fact that the video has the orginal extra's didn't matter.  I love this movie and anyone else that does should buy this just for the color version. It brings a new addition to your lives.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|Refined edition of an opera+sublime dvd like most from \\"Opus Arte\\" where pictures are taken through HD cameras. True, not anyone can do dvd better.
0312995423|3.0|Obiously, this is not Brown's best, I would rather say it is his worse. I would call this book an easy to read and entertaining story. Some parts of the plot are ending in a weird fashion and the characters seem too fictive. I could not really feel the emotions of the characters, they are too easily \\"written\\". Also, their psychological evolution is unrealistic and predictable.     However, Brown's writing style is there: the story is filled with action and the novel is divided in numerous, short well-written chapters. If you like Brown's other books and you are looking for a action-filled story for a weekend read, this is for you. Go for Deception Point or Da Vinci Code if this is your first DB novel.
B000TDGGVU|4.0|A glance at the compelling thesis presented on the back of this book made me wonder why I'd never heard of it before. Now I know why: Mr. Shwartz questions a prevailing cultural paradigm in a way that just makes you feel very uncomfortable! Ultimately though, if you're willing to take the plunge, you'll gain a greater understanding of how derive more satisfaction and less anxiety from life. However, the approach of simply limiting choice may be a little materialistic. From a Christian perspective, it seems that the outlined negative consequences of abundant choice can be diffused by spending time in prayer. Also, this book gets redundant about halfway through. Overall an awesome investment of time and money given the great importance of the subject matter.
0393324818|5.0|Think you know baseball? Think again. This book follows the 2002 season of the Oakland A's, the team with the second lowest payroll in baseball, but one which managed to win more games than any other team in the late 1990s and early 2000s.     Moneyball is a fascinating study in how baseball's Old Order, its Established Way of Doing Things, clashed with a new, more rational, data-driven method of making decisions. It's full of the colorful personalities and gripping roller coaster you'll find in any great baseball book. But Moneyball takes you deeper. It takes you \\"into the numbers\\" to show how advanced statistics, game theory, and the laws of probability are harnessed by really smart people to make better baseball decisions.     You don't have to be a long-suffering small market fan (like me) to enjoy this book. It's a universal story of how change happens in a change-resistant institution. A great read not only for baseball fans, but for those who are interested in the dynamics of change in many different kinds of organizations.
B000XA5K48|4.0|\\"Shoot Em Up\\" shows the best use of carrots aside from a Rachel Ray cooking show or a Bugs Bunny cartoon. And cartoon this movie is with Clive Owen as Bugs and Paul Giamatti as Elmer Fudd, and features more choreography than a big Broadway musical only instead of tap it features rat-a-tat-tat.  The story concerns a new-born infant it seems that everyone is out to kill but is protected by owen as Smith and a lactating hooker.  In fact Owen delivers the baby at the same time he's in a shootout with about two or three dozen thugs.  The body count only increases and it seems every extra in Hollywood was used to bite the dust and when Smith runs out of bullets he always has a carrot handy to be used as a lethal weapon.    Despite the continual bloodshed the movie is entertaining and certainly never dull and I can't recall in recent history a skydiving shoot-out.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I still have 6 episodes left to watch, but so far this season does not disappoint.  I still love LOST as much as I did in the first season.  These DVDs were definitely worth the money!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy is what movies of this genre should hold as the standard. The makers of Troy, unlke the guys that did 300, understood that you don't need any cheesy slow-mo when showing a massive war. Also, the script is kind of underrated. Brad Pitt's acting may have been a little stiff, but he was given such great lines that no one really could have messed up the part of Achilles. Also, the portrayals of Hector, Odysseus, and Priam were great. Great script, great acting (on the whole), and great special effects make Troy a great movie.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I waited 5 years for the Kenneth Branagh Hamlet to come out on DVD and it was worth it.  I like it especially because you can turn on the close caption and follow along with the language.
1932100660|5.0|This book is great!! Don't read this book if you are not interested in making life changes.  The studies Dr. Campbell was involved in are very impressive. There is much evidence in this book to make a believer out of me that there is a better way to live and eat.  At last there is another way to live besides supporting the pharmaceutical companies and the traditional medicine treatment of today. My husband is on b/p and cholesterol meds and we want to get him off!!!  Now we believe that is a possibility.  There will be sacrifices to be sure, but we will feel better and be healthier longer rather than supporting the medical industry and dying with huge medical bills!!  Good luck to those of you who dare to look and feel better!!!
B00005JPLW|3.0|Very good movie! Highly entertaining. You feel the honor and repect for their country and people...   I think they could show more battle scenes and less about the families.  If you never seen this movie before, you will be entertained! WB
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I enjoyed the original X-Men movie, but it doesn't hold a candle to this sequel. The script for X2 was great, as far as movies of this genre are concerned. It did what the original X-Men comics did quite well; portray prejudice in a unique fashion. Ian Mckellen is absolutely perfect as Magneto; one of my favorite villains ever. The special effects are also quite good, right up there with just about any great SFX movie I've ever seen. This movie was just handled superbly in every facet.
0440238609|5.0|These books are the pinnacle of authorship. Pullman creates an entirely new fantasy world. His characterization and content leave little to criticize. However these books, as Pullman himself has stated, are ultimately about killing God. I would not recommend this text for those sensitive to this issue. It will make you angry. However, if you like Random House Children's Books, \\"support the first amendment and the right to read\\" you will not be disappointed by this amazing trilogy. It is truly a work of art and it makes you think.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|This is an awesome movie!! I love it! I think, it is the best in the Die Hard series! I can't imagine how they \\"arranged\\" (shot) some of those sequences.  Bruce Willis is a 1000% better than 'Moonlighting' series on TV...WB
0307277887|3.0|The first half of this book was really good, but it was all downhill from there. It was as if the writer just kind of gave up on the second half, because all of the originality that the first half had was gone. Also, the ending was kinda predictable. I think the show handled the premise much better than this book did.

B000YCLRBA|4.0|This is a  magnificent performance and an innovative production of Tchaikovsky's beloved Eugene Onegin. It was my favorite \\"Met at the Movies\\" performance last year, and I was very much looking forward to its release on dvd. That said, there was some editing done, and not for the better, which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five. Still, I wouldn't want to be without this one in my collection.
1582701709|5.0|For those reviews that say this book teaches lack of compassion and empathy, I say read it again. It is stated in this book that you won't get anything you want out of life without giving to others. Read it more than once if you did not get that message the first time around. Of course constantly thinking about the things you want out of life instead of dwelling on the things you don't want will make you a happier more positive person. And if you spend all that time thinking about something you will of course figure out a way to get it. The Secret works, if you let it.    I don't understand those that ask for scientific evidence that \\"The Secret\\" works. In the US over 75% of people believe in some kind of God, I have yet to see proof!
0143038419|2.0|i found this book to be way overrated and the author egotistical. would've been nice to read more about the cultures she encountered and less about her. about half way through the book i wanted to tell her to get over herself already.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|Don't know how they're going to top this one or write in a sequel.  Or maybe there is none planned.  But for once, here is a sequel that surpasses its already very good predecessor - this movie was great.  WOuld love to see a fourth be made.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is such a good show! I love all the law and criminal shows like Criminal Minds and Law and Order SVU. This show is great. Obviously it pushes a little more than the typical cable show. We love it and can't wait for Season 2 to come to DVD!
B000JBWWQ0|4.0|If you are a fan of the book you will want to see the movie.  It is pretty low budget, but the message is still there.  Hopefully the movie will get more people to read the book.  If you even found the movie there is a reason for it and you should explore that.  Happy viewing!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of my favorite books and I recently saw the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre production and wanted to share with you how wonderful it was.  The casting was brilliant, the acting exceptional, the set/scenery magnificant!  It followed the book with only a little artistic license taken which was excellent as well.  Don't miss this, you will be delighted with it!
0679809015|5.0|My daughter is 20 months and just loves this book.  She can't stop opening the little flaps on each page.  It keeps her entertained, plus she learns about the animals and sounds they make when I read it to her.
B00009TB5G|4.0|There are quite a few more scenes in the extended edition, but they are just extended parts of other scenes for the most part.  A lot of focus on Eowyn, some on Aragorn, a bit on Frodo and Sam (and Sam's rope), and some on Merry and Pippin with the Ents.
B00008BXJG|5.0|That about nine out of ten of the one-star reviews for this album are all from the same prig registered under different names; he mispells \\"insted\\" in almost every review and constantly plugs Dire Straits, Foreigner and Metallica. Yeah, enough said. Amazon should really create a system to weed out spam reviews like his/hers/its.    Anyway, this album is a classic. If you listen to only a few songs and decide you dislike the entire work, just do us a favor and stick nails into your ears. Rusty ones, at that. If you listen to the entire work and still dislike it, well, your loss. Geddy Lee I'm sure will console you (I've found that the majority of AC/DC-haters are unfortunate Rush addicts.)    This is Bon Scott-era AC/DC at its most humble, in my simple (but correct) opinion. Earlier works were definitely raunchier, focusing moreso on cranking out rough-edged rockers whereas with this album, the focus switches towards a more 'produced' sound, courtesy of Robert John Lange. That's not to say it doesn't rock as hard as their previous releases; this album rocks - hard - and in spades, it just seems, not necessarily 'cleaner,' but more matured?    They're getting older, and it shows. By the time they laid out Powerage, it is apparent that they had determined to produce the best album they possibly could have at the time, not necessarily one that only rocks as loudly as it can just for the sake of rocking loudly. Powerage is an excellent album, and Highway to Hell really shows that they could take an idea that works and build upon it without changing formula, but also without simply repeating more of the same.  This album really seems like one put together for the fans in mind.    AC/DC has definitely discovered their values by this album, and it's a shame that we could not have had Bon Scott around for at least a few albums more before he decided to...Well, you know. But did anybody really expect him to live to old age anyway?    This album was of course followed by Backin Black, an album which I'm convinced will still be listened to for decades to come.    Five star album.
B0000024JA|5.0|Hmmm, I knew my boyfriend was looking for this hard-to-find CD and with great stealth, timing and your site....I found it, got it delivered quick and knocked his socks off when I handed it to him....his face just lit up and w/o any words, I knew I had just entered another dimension w/ him. Hey, what got me working fast to getting this CD is that 'All I Need' song~he played it for me and I was hooked. Method Man...you have once again worked in mysterious and magical ways...ummmph, I look forward to hearing it played in the background and kissing and luving on my own method man;)
B000RW3VD4|5.0|This movie is definitely a classic and a must buy for those who appreciated Boiler Room and like making $$.

If you have a 20, 60 or 80GB PlayStation 3 or a Super Audio CD player (SACD) then do yourself a favour and get the UK version.<br /><br />The difference between the SACD version of the Album and any of the versions presented on this US one is night and day. It's tragic that they have screwed up all the US versions of the DM reissues.<br /><br />Go for the fidelity - your ears will love you for it.

081541028X|5.0|I've read a fair number of books on Apollo, but not very many astronaut biograpies.  I chose this one mostly because of its good reviews on this page!    It's definitely well written, surprisingly humorous, and full of fascinating details on the Gemini 10 and Apollo 11 mission that I had never heard about.  (His short descriptions of the other astronauts are particularly funny.)    His book really answers the question:  What would it really be like to fly critical missions during the space race?  To work with other famous astronauts (not just Neil and Buzz but also John Young)?  He makes his nuanced and deep emotions clear throughout, giving the book an \\"everyman's\\" perspective.    Can't recommend this one enough.
B00006CXSS|2.0|[[ASIN:B00006CXSS Band of Brothers]]    Ordered a new set, not used and when the package was opened disc #6 was missing.  This was a Christmas gift and I was able to get a return authorization but the person to whom the gift was given does not want to go through the headache of a return.  He will keep as is, said the disc #6 does not have to do with the story but  about the bonus features and he will do without.  So very sad to give a gift and have it appear as it they were given something that had been used.  :-(
B000MQC9H4|4.0|This is a great show.  My wife loved it and had to have it.  She has seen it 5 or 6 times.  I great movie for a date or just chill'n at home.  However, the greatness of the movie was overshadowed by Amazon's extremely untimely shipping schedule.  I purchased the DVD on 12/8/07 and did not recieve it until 12/31/08, totally put a damper on a Christmas surprise.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|I thought the movie was boring didnt see very much action other two movies were better than this.
B000J103PC|3.0|So this should be sub-titled \\"A cautionary tale for girls\\". The basic message seems to be \\"don't be ambitious, girls, it'll make you miserable and bitter and nobody will like you or be close to you. Be content with smaller things and don't dream big, it's too scary out there.\\" Either that or \\"Don't change who you are inside for the high life, don't betray your friends, it's morally wrong and makes you into a bad person who doesn't like or recognize herself and it's not worth it\\".<br /><br />One of those messages should be listened to by all those silly girls desperately wearing the aggressively trashy clothing and excessive bling; the other is a crock of bad beans.<br /><br />Aside from that it's a wonderful movie and I enjoyed it immensely.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The Nikon products are the best on the market and this little flash is no exception. I received this flash and was inpressed by the output from such a smaller than usual flash. I would recomend this flash for those on a buddget and wanting to get away from their on camera flashes. Although you can't use this as a slave flash you can us it to trigger flashes that are capable of being slaves. Having said all that I was a little upset at the slow shipping, I did use standard shipping but, I have got things faster than from this Co.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Such an amazing movie. The idea behind it as well as the execution are fantastic. You can't beat the picture's quality and vibrance.
B000XA5K48|4.0|I rented this film with low expectations. A friend of mine said that it was stupid so I saw this with an open mind. \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is a movie with a title that speaks for itself. Sorry, Dee-Nut, I will have to disagree with you with this movie. True, the film is so ridiculously unreal but boy, it sure is a lot of fun to watch! Action and gunplay is all you're in for with this film.<br /><br />A man named Smith (Clive Owen) with a sordid past is in a bus stop one evening. He spies a pregnant woman being pursued by bad guys led by Hertz (Paul Giamatti) and decides to get involved. What results is a fast-paced action packed shoot `em up from start to finish....<br /><br />Such a short description of the plot details, isn't it? Actually, there is a plot, it just gets broken down throughout the proceedings. While I do not want to go through the details, I will just describe it by going through its themes: a Baby for the rescuing, a beautiful hooker (Monica Belucci), an eccentric bad guy, a politician mixed in and an anti-hero with an unknown past. The rest is non-stop hyper-kinetic action. Writer and director Michael Davis knew what he wanted to do when he made this film. A slam-bang, hard-boiled cool stylish action flick that is stripped down much of anything else such as intricate storytelling and character development. This is a very gutsy move on his part. Critical eyes (Hey, I am a nit-picker myself) may argue that the lack of plot is its downfall and while it is, the director sure knew where he was headed. Sometimes, audiences just want action and \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" does deliver!<br /><br />The style of the film is a bit hard to breakdown. Let's see, I did catch hints of the atmosphere of another comic book inspired film \\"Sin City\\" (in color), Hong Kong \\"Bullet Ballet\\" and Japanese \\"Pistol Opera\\", the sly humor and grittiness of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", the outrageous silliness of \\"Planet Terror\\" and the over-the-top attitude of Luc Besson films. I believe the director really wanted to overload our senses with a lot of adrenaline-driven action sequences so the weaknesses of the film will not reach our brains. This film is pure action \\"junk\\" with one goal; to entertain its viewer.<br /><br />With a movie with almost no plot and character depth, it is important that the lead actor fits the role otherwise the movie will be a farce. Thankfully, Clive Owen manages to convincingly pull off his anti-hero role with dynamic charisma that complements the screenplay. It is also fortunate that Owen is supported by the great performance of Paul Giamatti who plays the lead villain; Hertz and mega babe Monicca Belucci sure is very pleasing to the eyes as Donna. aLSO, IT WAS VERY AMUSING that the film-makers opted for carrots instead of the stereotypical cigarettes or toothpicks to signify the hero's \\"coolness\\".<br /><br />\\"SHOOT `EM UP\\" is geared towards the male audience with its unrealistic, ridiculously over the top action sequences, but I am sure the female audience will be swooned with Owen's charismatic appeal. While its main weakness is the unreal comic book approach, it is also its greatest strength. I have to commend the director in knowing exactly what he was \\"aiming\\" for. I've read that Baby Oliver was cast in the role before he was born, a woman carrying twins was selected. If that didn't exhibit commitment to his art, then I'm not sure what else. I admire directors who know which direction they want to go. The film plays almost like a stunt performance but hey, I am not complaining.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Shoot `Em Up\\" is a fun and entertaining experience. Ridiculous, unrealistic and maybe even cartoonish; but one thing it sure isn't is boring. The film is a lot of FUN.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED! For fans of \\"Bullet Ballet\\" and \\"Pistol Opera\\" [3 ½ Stars]<br />I would advise to watch this without any minors present because of the nudity, sexual themes and bad language.<br /><br />VIDEO/AUDIO: 2.40 ratio ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN.

B000002KYK|5.0|The version of \\"Memories Of Green\\" that appears here is far better than the original later released.It's worth it alone in buying the CD.  The overall quality and playing of the music is excellent. I also have the official OST and its also fine in its own way.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|...it's hard to not think of the train wreck she's become while listening to it.  Sorry, Britney.  I wish I could help you out in some way.
B00004RE0E|5.0|Just wanted to say that the SACD version of this album sounds great.  Some SACDs don't sound all that different from the CD version, but this one is a noticeable improvement over its redbook counterpart.  There's no multi-channel, just stereo that sounds exactly like it's supposed to.  The album itself is one of my life-long favorites, but I assume if you're considering the SACD you already know the music so I won't go into detail.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|It's A Wonderful Life is not only the BEST Christmas film, it was James Stewart's favourite.  He also thought it was the one character closest to himself.  He is as much loved in this film as he was in life and his legacy will live on for many, MANY years to come through this film.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000HEWEJO It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition)]]
B000002H2H|4.0|This album was my introduction to speed metal back in the day.  It blew me away then, and I still enjoy it today.  I strongly prefer Master of Puppets, so go for that one first if you don't already have it, then come back to Ride the Lightening to see where that came from, then go back yet again to Kill Em All.  All three of these albums are amazing, and all have something unique to offer.  I think listening to them in reverse order helps you appreciate the earlier albums because you recognize details that will later reach their full potential on Puppets.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|Obviously a \\"must-have\\" for all Gilmore Fans.  The DVD set is great.  The bonus material has become pretty scarce.  There's not much of any substance there.  Don't let that stop you from getting the DVDs.  I rewatched the entire 7 seasons over the summer and fall...and this was a great ending to a great series.
B00005JPTI|3.0|Faithless adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic sci-fi novel still manages to be engaging in its own right, thanks largely to the onscreen appeal of that one-man box-office juggernaut, Will Smith - and his dog. The terrifically tense staging of some sequences compensates, surprisingly, for a largely plotless and hole-ridden narrative and some clunky digital effects. Purists be warned: this is not the book you read, but it's still more speculative fiction than popcorn movie.
B000RJO578|5.0|This movie is brilliant.  The attention to detail in every scene for comedic value is superb.  The editor is the BEST editor Ive ever come across, and I can say this by having watched the deleted scenes.  If you enjoy The Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy, or Shawn of the Dead...this movie has many of the same actors.  The DVD extras are fabulous, you even get to see the flip picture cartoon on the other side of the notebook from the traffic violation scene.
B000I0RR7Q|5.0|Warner Bros. has done an excellent job in bringing this classic to the \\"small screen\\" (I have a 62in DLP) in Hi-Def.  Pristine transfer of a restored black&white film.  The film itself is a classic, as is \\"Carrotblanca\\" the LoonyToons send up with Bugs, Sylvester, Daffy and the rest of the animated crowd.  Best of the extras are the Lauren Bacall narrated tribute and the backstory on how the movie was made. The TV version is an example of how to screw up something good (loved the GE steam iron ad, though).  The audio clips were a bit disappointing.  I assume Warner has or will have this out in Blu-Ray; would be interesting to compare the two.  I imagine a good upscaling DVD player would make the regular DVD look better, but why settle for second rate, and mess with two DVDs instead of one, HD-DVD.  A must have for any serious motion picture collection.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This CD completed my collection of SOAD. They make such an amazing music! Love it!!
0060989157|5.0|I grew up listening to Motley Crue, and any fan of the band is going to love this book.  The various points of view give different sides of some of the more controversial and some of the more amazing stories.  From where they came from to living and breathing (and shooting)rock n' roll to reflecting about their adventures of years gone by, I couldn't put it down.  Only one question still  remains for me....How on earth did these four guys live to tell about it?
B00005OCMR|5.0|This one really makes you wonder how they did some of the effects before CGI took over.  Storyline is cheesy but still enjoyable.  Very nostalgic for us early nerds.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the best price I have seen for this item. I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he can't stop watching it. Great for war movie lovers!
B000E6GBV2|4.0|I bought this album for one song, \\"The Funeral\\", which can be heard on the popular video game \\"Skate\\". I was worried that making the purchace based on that influence alone would be a mistake but was relieved to hear the rest of the album to be just as satisfying. The South Carolina band produced some very Earthy tones on each track and it is a nice cd to enjoy while stretching out on the couch to relax. The only negative comment that I could make would be that a couple songs sound too much alike.Something like that can be overlooked.
0743289684|5.0|Biographies in my experience are sometimes written in a \\"lecturing\\" tone. This book is so engrossing and well written I almost can't believe its a biography. Ayaan life story is the topic of \\"Infidel\\";  namely her ascention from refuge to politician to researcher and activist, all thus far in 30-some years. I learned more on everyday Islamic culture and treatment of women in this book than I have during 3 college electives I've had on Islam.     If Ayaan's safety could be ensured, I'd love to see a screenplay written based on this book. She is truely an icon.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Easy to install, lots of choices for mounting, looks like this is made well with heavy duty construction.  Instructions are a bit weak or maybe its me.  Had a hard time understanding that the raise lower movement is achived by pushing in on the knuckle to release a lock, I thought it was just stiff and so pushed harder until I gave up and luckily discovered this unlock/lock.
0201433079|5.0|I occasionally need to fix broken IPC code and figure out behavior differences  of legacy code between Solaris, Linux, etc., code written years ago by somebody  else in C.    This book, (and Stevens' earlier books before this) has been immensely useful.  The code samples alone are worth their weight in gold :-).  Seriously, this book   has saved me many days of hard work, several times over.    A quick browse of the book is usually enough to find the details (what I would   call 'arcane details', but I guess this is because I'm not an expert C/networking  programmer), figure out the problem AND how to fix the problem.      This book has been a 'project-saver'.  I cannot recommend this text too highly.
B0000646UN|5.0|Anyone knowing their military history might be put off by the movie covers of this newly released version, the (US!) M4 and GIs w/winter cami and the back cover of US troops moving in a rush might make you think you've got the wrong movie BUT it's Winter War, just a much longer version.   I've watched many war movies; some foreign but mostly American.  Many of the films were at best okay with even more simply Hollywood crap.  Winter War though is one of the best I've ever seen.  Any grunt, of any real Army can relate to what is happening in the film.  Military historians can appreciate the effort that went into this film too.  From the basic Swedish Mausers of the Finnish reservists, lack of uniforms, WW1 Chauchat light MGs to the Soviet infantry carrying Mosent Naugants in their peaked Budenney caps and dark greatcoats to the T26 tanks, I17 fighters, and armored cars--serious efforts were made to do justice to a story that Americans should learn.  The extended version adds more to the story, explaining the destinies of several characters who the earlier version left out.  There is also more of the universal bureaucratic mess of any Army, in this case the mess that the call-up was for many Finnish units.  There is also more detail in some of the fighting, much of it adding considerably to the overall movie itself.  The homefront intervals are bittersweet.  The scenes in the Church, the cameras panning across the crowds honoring their dead while praying for victory would not be shot in a Hollywood film, too unabashedly religious and patriotic.  The too fleeting moments together of families before the storm and on leave are well done too, not maudlin but touching.  The fighting scenes are awesome, no other word to describe the human wave attacks and bitter trench fighting.  The taking on of the light Russian armor with Molotov cocktails and tree trunks relate the desperation of the outgunned/numbered Finns.  For the Finns, their fighting abilities and dogged defense is complimented by the Soviet tactical incompetence.  A great movie, perhaps one of the best in gritty realism and storytelling.  I cannot praise it enough.  The Finns are justifiably proud of this period in their military history, it is an inspiring tale for anyone looking at real war.
1594489505|5.0|As a woman, I enjoyed this book even more than Kite Runner. A must read!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Only George Martin, being so intimately connected with the Beatles' creative process, could have compiled such an extraordinary, thoughtful and artistic montage of Beatles' classics.  This is a unique presentation of their material, so please come into the listening experience with \\"open ears.\\"  There are no truly separate tracks here, just an ongoing stream of material linked together in new and unexpected ways, including overlaying songs one on top of the other.  For instance, Ringo sings \\"Octopus's Garden\\" over the string track for \\"Goodnight,\\" a clever and effective way of honoring two of Ringo's famous vocals.  The sound quality is spectacular, and you'll hear nuances that we missed the first time around, due to improved digital techniques.  There is also some alternate material here, for example an amazing acoustic version of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" and even snippets of instrumental and vocal arrangements never heard before.    I believe you'll need to be familiar with the Beatles' catalog in order to really appreciate all the musical relationships that George Martin and his son Giles bring forward here.  If you love the Beatles but this all seems hard to imagine, take the plunge and listen for yourself.  \\"Love\\" is a unique type of remix, a very special project, and a labor of love from perhaps the only person who could do the Beatles justice in this way.
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|Being a grouchy old man, I'd love to have something really bad to say... but I don't :0) While I have read the books, and totally enjoyed them, the movies can't possibly include as much detail. Still, the basic story is there and the level of excitement comes through (especially in surround sound).
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I bought this as a present for my sister, after she raved about seeing an episode of the old TV show on TV. Apparently she watched the show back in the early 70's and was tickled pink to own a copy for her very own!  She raved about this video and told everyone at work! I think it turned out to be the best present I've ever bought her! Believe me she has everything so it was very special :)
B000067FP8|5.0|Gremlins 2 The New Batch is great because it breaks the mold for most sequels in that it doesn't suck and improves on the original. The Gremlins themselves are even scarier thanks to genetic engineering, but are even more hilarious than before. They balanced horror and comedy brilliantly in this movie. Also the cameos were brilliant, from John Astin to Hulk Hogan.<br /><br />An 80's type Donald Trump owns the 'Clamp' building. You got to love his logo, a big 'C' squishing the earth. Anyway through a series of unfortunate events in which Gizmo multiplies from a broken water fountain, the Gremlins overtake the building and every and any mayhem you can imagine ensues.<br /><br />Plus we have the great Chritsopher Lee as a genetic scientist working in the building. When the Gremlins drink his experimetal liquids, we have brain Gremlins, vegetable Gremlins, bat Gremlins, and my favorite, the spider Gremlin.<br /><br />This is a fun movie and not too scary for the kids.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This was a replacement for a lost copy.  Thanks for the always excellent service!
0446401307|4.0|I think Blood Work remains Connely's weakest novel, but this is unarguably the weakest Harry Bosch novel.  Do you blame it on the fact it started out as a magazine serial? Perhaps.  Connelly begins the story promising enough kind of going all Jack Bauer on us, but switches gears.  Bosch doesn't really care if terrorists are going to destroy LA.  He's a detective.  He wants to solve a homicide.  I get it, I guess.  Don't believe it though.  But Connelly has a great knack for keeping his readers involved, and I was never bored.  Don't want to give away too many spoilers or plot points.  Let's just say the ending was telegraphed from a mile away, and I was left unsatisfied.  Still I'm giving it four stars because I would recommend it for a quick read to almost everyone.  I can't say that for books I give 3 stars to.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I was not aware when I purchased this item that we were required to have the capability of playing an HD DVD.  I think you should make customers aware that there are different versions.  I gave it as a gift to my husband, who opened it to watch it only to find out that we don't have the proper equipment.  It was opened and beyond the 30 day period.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This is one of the best British miniseries I have watched. There were complaints about the thick British accents being hard t understand. I did not find this to be the case; all of the speaking parts were quite understandable.   Ian Richardson gives a marvelous performance as the parliamentary whip who longs to be Prime Minister. He acheives this thru multiple underhanded activities. This is a true British satire about the Crown and Parliment and one cannot truly enjoy this production if they don't see it as satire.  I am a fan of British productions as they are much better writen and acted. This is a set I rented and then purchased because you really need to watch it more than once to catch all of the nuances in the performances. Definitately a 5 star performance by all involved.

Its primary audience is the DSLR user, but it is also loaded with tips for the average point 'n shoot user.  It is as good a 1-volume reference as I have found in this price range.  Save your money for more gadgets, and buy this book.  It's a bargain.
B000WQ9UA8|2.0|Very produced studio sound. Not much effort or thought went into this album. Skip it.
0679720200|4.0|I have used this book in a variety of classes ranging from beginning level French culture to teaching college reading prep skills.  I choose it because students are often surprised at the lack of involvement Meursault has in his own life.  This was the point Camus was trying to make, to be sure.  This book is separated into two distinct parts: before and after M. goes to jail for killing some arabs.  The book will spart a debate on racism, gender issues, cultural issues of the pied-noir and lliterary styles like absurdism.  Did I mention that it is not that long?  That is the students' favorite part.      Anyone should try it for something different.  You don't need to be in a lit class to enjoy it.
1596680296|4.0|I love this book for knitting socks, It's very understandable, It has photo's to show exsamples of how to knit the socks, that helps a great deal with the instuctions.  Good Book for all stages of sock knitting.

1577314808|5.0|This book contains elements that I have not seen anywhere else.  I have been studying by listening to it for 5 months now.  It is a definitive guide to how to become enlightened.  Enlightenment is a state of consciousness and attaining this state is well worth it because it gives you peace.  We will certainly slip in and out of enlightenment because it is easy to forget that the physical world and our minds, our emotions, our pain bodies are a huge distraction.  The most valuable teaching I think is that we focus on what is going on inside of ourselves and beneath all the chaos within us is the stillness which is who we really are.  We are all \\"one\\" and self realizing this I believe is the most wonderful thing we can remember!

B000WQ9UA8|3.0|I really enjoyed this cd for the most part; only one problem.  Nothing has really caught on.  I mean, I like the CD..but I don't crave to hear it like other CDs.  This could be due to the fact Britney's personal life makes me sick and tired of ANYTHING Britney.  There are a few good songs.  My favorite would be Hot as Ice; it's catchy.  Piece of me is great... and after hearing Gimme More when I go out.. .I've warmed up to it.  Maybe I just need to hear it a few more times.  If you like Britney, buy it.  Otherwise, skip it.

0525950079|5.0|I'll start by saying that I read 'Pillars of the Earth' years ago and loved it. However the memory is faint, so I can draw no direct comparison between the books and instead will strictly say that on it's own merits this is a wonderful and engaging read. Four friends in 14th century Kingsbridge witness a violent act that sets the courses of their lives. However, as the massive tome proceeds forward,the center of the story is really the love affair between the young idealistic architect Merthin, and the headstrong and brilliant Caris. Earthy, sweet Gwenda, and violent, short tempered Ralph both have their definite roles to play, but for the most part become secondary characters. I think it's a tremendous feat alone to write a book over a thousand pages and for the most part make is so compelling. There is a formula much like 'Pillars' to it, that you know by the end, good will prevail, evil will be destroyed,and love will conquer all.- It's just the absorbing journey is bumpy, and fraught with lying, cheating, murder, and-oh yes, the Plague. It's great fun, and like 'Pillars', easy to lose yourself in for a day or two. Or fifteen.
B000XA5K48|1.0|*Warning* This review has a few spoilers (if you can call them that). This is THE worst movie I have ever seen. It tops Transporter 2 on my list of movies I wish I hadn't wasted 30 min watching. I bought this movie thinking that Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, two of todays best actors, could not possibly do me wrong. They did. They owe me 20 bucks and an apology. They've also lost me as a fan. If they read the script (if there was one) before agreeing to make this movie and still decided to make this movie, then they aren't my type of actors. This movie had no chance. Here are a few reasons why this movie was bad:<br /><br />1. All of the \\"bad guys\\" are stupid. They all fire full clips and hit nothing. While Clive Owen is taking cover, they stand and wait to be shot.<br />2. Clive Owens' character never misses, never. He is Robin Hood with a gun. He doesn't even need a gun to kill people with bullets. If you really want to waste 2 hours of your life to find out what this means, I feel for you.<br />3. Every one liner used in this movie makes you cringe. If overly simple quotes like \\"So much for seatbelts\\" is funny to you, then forget I said anything.<br />4. *Spoiler* The stunts are absolutely ridiculous and impossible for anyone to actually do. For example, a car and a van racing at each other head on at 60+ mph (guestimate), hit each other head on. This propels Clive Owen through his windshield, through the vans windshield, into the back of the van, where he kills everyone when inside. If you would like to know what happens next, see reason 3.<br />5. Mindless. Some people don't like new, fresh, or creative ideas in movies, but I do. And this movie has none of these. This is a B- movie with A list actors.<br /><br />If you couldn't already tell, this movie is horrible. Bad acting, impossible stunts, mind-numbing one-liners, and a horrible plot. Take this as a warning, and rent the movie if you really must see it. I unfortunately bought it then gave it away the next day as a joke on a friend. Wait and see... This will be in the $4.99 bin at your local supermarket soon.it and see... This will be in the $4.99 bin at your local supermarket soon.

015626224X|4.0|'Down And Out' was first published in 1933, an account of the poverty stricken streets of both Paris and London during the era.  It bears little resemblance to today's homeless problems, but is an interesting study in older times where sweeping a sidewalk could make a difference between bread and no bread.<br /><br />A friend of mine told me that if I liked 'The Jungle' by Upton Sinclair that I should read 'Down And Out In Paris And London'.  I found few similarities other than the filthy kitchens that Orwell describes, but I was glad this Orwell book was referred to me.  All I've read by the author before are the standard 'Animal Farm' and '1984' that most people have read. (If you haven't read them, you should, they're great)<br /><br />Orwell's protagonist begins the story in the slums of Paris, occasionally teaching English classes for a bit of money.  (One of the things I had a hard time translating is the foreign currency: a shilling, a franc, a sou, a pence, a crown, a pound, etc.  But the prices are so out of date now in 2008 that it mattered very little)  He's down and out on his luck, and running out of rent money.  When he thinks he's at his lowest his friend Boris brings them a job at Hotel X, where the protagonist works as a plongeur (dishwasher/gopher/whatever).  He works long, hot hours for little money, but can afford his rent.  Boris has another dream though, that they both become employed at a 'yet to be opened' restaurant where Boris is promised a higher position.  By the time our protagonist works at the new restaurant, he begins to believe that all the violations and harassments at Hotel X were superior.  Becoming fed up with the harsh conditions and long hours, the protagonist writes to a friend in London for a position, which his friend promises.<br /><br />Worthy of note are the descriptions of the Hotel's and restaurant's kitchens.  They are filthy beyond imagination, and the working conditions deplorable.  Though the book is older and there are more inspections nowadays than there were back then, you'll still question the next meal that is served before you, even from a fancy restaurant.<br /><br />Our protagonist packs up and leaves Paris. Unfortunately, the position promised to him in London, that of looking after a feeble patron, isn't ready, so he's on the streets without lodging, food, or work to provide for himself.  He spends time in the charity lodgings of London, meeting up with Paddy and Bozo and other characters.  He quickly learns the ways of the street, and extrapolates on the cause and condition of the homeless society he finds himself in.<br /><br />The characters are fascinating.  There's Boris - loud, lame, and strange.  Charlie, who lives off a pittance from his family and will not work (and who loves the ladies - once portrayed in a horrible story he told).  There's Paddy, resigned to his fate.  There's Bozo, a screever (pavement artist), and a star-gazer who has an astonishingly bright outlook on street life.<br /><br />The concept of work vs idleness is explored, along with the concept of how hard the homeless actually \\"work\\" (panhandling, selling matches, selling herbs like lavender, getting up early and waiting in line for jobs, \\"screeving\\", pawning, even stealing) for the privilege of a bug ridden cot and watered down tea.  The book is a study in poverty even though its outdated.  The one thing I didn't like about it was the abrupt ending.  The story could have used a little more conclusion, in my opinion.  Overall, I'm glad I explored this addition to my Orwell collection, and highly recommend it.

B00104W8T6|5.0|I listened to this soundtrack online before I bought it.  I love the music on here.  The music fits the theme of the movie well.  My favorite track is \\"Anyone Else But You\\" performed by the movie's two stars.  It is an excellent song about friendship and love.  The Moldy Peaches version is good too, but I like the version with two young actors better.  \\"All I Want Is You\\" is a easy listening song by Barry Louis Polisar. It has a nice blue grass sound to it.  I like the guitar and harmonica  playing on this track. I also loved \\"All The Young Dudes\\" by Mott the Hoople.  It is a classic song written by David Bowie.  I love Ian Hunter's vocals and the opening cords of this song very much. I have never heard of Kimya Dawson, but I think she has a sweet voice on the track she sings here especially \\"Tire Swing\\" and \\"Tree Hugger\\".  Cat Power's rendition of \\"Sea Of Love\\" is pretty romantic.  I like this track very much. The Kinks  \\"A Well Respected Man\\" is a tribute to all the guys out there who work hard and try to do the right thing.  I'm Sticking With You is a good song about loyalty.  I think the Velvet Underground harmonize well on this track.  \\"Superstar\\" by Sonic Youth is kind of too slow for me.  \\"Vampire\\" is a cute track.  This song has an innocent sound to it.  I love the guitar strumming here.  This is an excellent soundtrack to one of the year's best movies.

B00104W8T6|5.0|Juno is a gentle, sweet, smart and moving comedy. It's a teen flick that works for adults, and an adult flick that works for teens. The soundtrack is the perfect background (and sometimes foreground) to what goes on in the film, but it also stands alone quite nicely. Most of the songs on the album are quiet, indie, folkie, and acoustic, like the Kimya Dawson songs (three of 'em) which are idiosnycractic and wonderful. Kimya Dawson (formerly of the Moldy Peaches who are also represented here) reminds me ALOT of the Be Good Tanyas (which is intended as a compliment), especially on Tire Swing. There are, however, also some great classic oldie songs from the Kinks and Buddy Holly and Mott the Hoople which are not acoustic-y folkie, but more raucous and energetic. Go out and enjoy the movie and I'm betting you will come back for the music.
B00002SSKI|5.0|[[ASIN:B00002SSKI Now and Then]]I was hesitant at first when I came to amazon because I wasn't sure how easy it would be to order things and get them. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to create an account, purchase items and have them delivered. I was very pleased with the movies I bought and I will continue to order from amazon.
