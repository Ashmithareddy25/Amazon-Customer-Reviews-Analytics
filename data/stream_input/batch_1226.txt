B004J4WKTW|3.0|First, I think the book is mis-marketed. Why compare it to Harry Potter when the only similarity is Magic? There is no sense of wonderment like in the Potter books.<br />Very slow paced and monotonous. I was tired of these character after the first hundred pages but kept reading thinking it was going to go somewhere big. It never did.<br />Maybe it would have been better if there weren't so many dry characters that were mysterious but not much else.  I am usually a fast reader but this took me a few weeks to get through.<br />Great beginning with no big pay off.<br />This is going to be a movie? For the Harry Potter/Twilight fans? This book is not for that audience at all. Unless they interject better characterizations and a few action scenes, this movie is going straight to cable.

I know I can't really complain as I got it as the free app, but I'm getting a FC everytime I take a picture.

B004289ZW0|1.0|This device works well when it works.  As others have noted, the method of turning this device on and off is a poor idea.  The swipe of a finger doesn't always work and worse, it turns itself on with a brush in your pocket or bag and you find a dead battery when you need it.  I've also noticed that when you put it on a glare shield in an aircraft or car it stops working if it heats up even a little in the sun.  The lights all stay solid but there is nolonger any data stream and my iPad goes back to \\"no gps\\".  Shut it off and let it cool for a while and it works again for a bit.  Requests for support from the German based company go unanswered for weeks at a time.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't bother with this unit.  Get a XGPS150 or a Bad Elf.
B0050PYNP8|2.0|We have here a movie that seems intent on making the point that those who believe in God and the Bible are completely rendered mental incompetents as the result of paranoia, wild eyed speculation, kook science, delusional fantasy, groupthink, and obsessive belief in a messiah figure.  And the one doing all this mental grunt work is an alien.  A Grey.  Escaped from Roswell.  Held by the government for sixty years.  Who gave them all srts of alien technology.  And he has super powers...  This film is either one of the greatest exercise in ironic self parody ever made or the greatest example of blind stupidity in film history.  The charicatures are so ham fisted that they just don't work.  My advice to Frost and co. is to go home and watch Monty Python for a week solid.  Ya wanna parody the excesses of religion?  THAT'S how it's done.  This movie simply makes me wonder what tortuous fundamentalist nightmares the writer endured as a child to feel the need to make such a blunt and frankly inept attempt at satire.  The only bonus is I saw this on a plane instead of buying it.

B0058WFO06|5.0|This is quite a different album from Insurgentes. Go in with the expectation that you will not get something as loud or relentless as that album. If you are familiar with Steven Wilson's work, you will hear bits and pieces of past things mixed here and there, but the overall effort is a step beyond what has come before.  To me, this wasn't an easy album to like at first. I am not a natural fan of the type of jazz blended in on the album, and everything seemed a bit random and without focus. But once I forced myself to be educated by it over the space of about a week and it eventually \\"clicked\\", I am hearing all kinds of things I never even knew where there on my first listens. It's well worth the effort to invest some time in this if it doesn't strike you as much to get worked up over at first.  Even after you reach that stage, you can discover even more by listening to it on a good sound system, where all kinds of textures and hidden sounds reveal themselves. The snare drum will connect with your ear drums, and the album as a whole preserves a good amount of dynamic range and makes good use of it. You will miss half the album by listening to it on your earbuds.  If I had rated this on first listen, I would have given it a 3/5. One week later, I rate it as one of the best albums I've ever heard (though I am not that familiar with his stated influences for this album), and a step above Insurgentes which was excellent in itself.  One final comment... I can't believe some people are suggesting that he could have left \\"Raider II\\" off the album and put the album on one CD instead of two. \\"Raider II\\" seems to me to be the centerpiece and a culmination of everything that goes on on the album and it's hard to imagine the album without it. Likewise, I don't understand the suggestions that it could be edited down to half the length. It is a 23-minute track that uses the advantage of length to add elements that would overstay their welcome on a shorter track. I agree that notmuch would be lost if maybe the last 2 minutes of the track were left off (the last 2 minutes are a Bass Communion-esque ending after what seems like the real ending), but halving it in length doesn't seem justifiable to me.  Excellent album, overall. I'm pretty sure I won't be hearing anything else as good as this this year. And get both the CD and the Blu-Ray because the CD is a derivative of the full surround mix on the Blu-Ray! The album is so good and the price of each is so affordable that this in no way feels like a rip-off or double-dipping.

You feel he understands Mozart. Like Von Karajan understands Wagner Sir Colin Davis understands Mozart. The sound quality is outstanding. Misha Donat has written excellent music notes. Also included in the book are photographs of the performance. Also included are short biographies of the performers and the conductor. Truly a magnificient performance indeed. Amazing vocal performances. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.

159102594X|4.0|This novel does a lot of things right. It has strong characters, above average prose, dark themes played straight without every being goofy, and a great mythology world building back story. It has some really great moments. Towards the end of the book it really gets interesting with just enough pay off to make it feel complete but with so much left to resolve for the next two installments.<br /><br />This book does have it's problems. It has characters going about with motivations but with no real plot to keep forward momentum chugging along. So even though I was entertained I felt interest weening because there was nothing in the story compelling me forward. Some things happen towards the end that makes me think that this will not be a problem for the rest of the series.<br /><br />Which leads me to say that this was a great book that makes you want to return to this world and visit its characters again. Looking forward to reading the second and third one.

030726999X|4.0|Some trilogies are better than others; but, any author who receives a contract to write any trilogy has written a series of novels which far surpass the average.  So, the remaining question of this novel's final book is: is this a better-than-average trilogy? Yes. And, that is why posthumous publication of a fourth novel will occur.  If alive, he could have met Arthur Clarke's directive -- \\"All good trilogies should end on the fifth novel.\\"<br /><br />This author has a few gifts which make his style more engrossing than most.  First, his journalistic background makes his writing quick, easy, and very precise.  Hemingway may be the most known for this Impressionistic style of writing, and this author is from the same mold.<br /><br />Secondly, he has a knack for story. Many journalists are known to frequent watering holes, imbibe with potent potables, and deliver scandalous reports, sometimes embellished by sot-minded fantasy, but always with the least honorable intentions.  And, anyone who spent years of this ritual would likely to have heard more than a few enticing yarns, from which the playful mind of the author could easily embellish and make into a good read.<br /><br />Thirdly, the author has a flair for the bizarre.  Sexual oddity is the norm in this as well as the previous novels.  Political espionage is more heightened here - to the point the Swedish good old boys are about as diabolical as the first novel's Nazis. Hmmm.  And, each has a propensity for torturing innocent women.<br /><br />Which leads me to the common theme of these books: women. Each book is an attempt to open eyes about the rights of women and how they are cruelly violated - even in western civilization where we are not as civilized as we would wish.  The super hero for women is Lisbeth Salander who is less than 5 feet tall, weighs less than 100 pounds, has no formal secondary education, and is about as abnormal as society would permit.  But, her contrarian ways triumph here as they do for many other fictional heroes - e.g. [[ASIN:B000GQOTBO The Fountainhead]]'s Howard Roarke.<br /><br />So what can the little woman do?  She can box with professional boxers; beat up local hooligans, embezzler from the nation's greatest embezzlers a la Robin Hood; tamper with any agency's computer without trace; and walk the streets at any hour without hesitation. And, she is apparently good in bed in an indiscriminate way - with men and women, with old or young.<br /><br />Since the books have come movies. All three books have been roughly made into Swedish films - probably the only Swedish films any of us have watched in decades. And, this cult-looking girl Salander has created a cult of her own.  And, with cults come marketing fortunes, which in turn catches the attention of Hollywood which is remaking the Swedish film with better looking actors, probably more skin, and no subtitles.  Sounds like a lot more money. And, hopefully Stieg Larson's family receives a just deserved wheel barrel full.IN:B000GQOTBO The Fountainhead]]'s Howard Roarke.   So what can the little woman do?

0316066524|3.0|Some books are long, and therefore too imposing to open.  Other books are long and imposing, but curiosity compels the reader to open the pages, which soon tells the reader the initial reaction was correct.  Others are long and imposing, but curiosity or word of mouth compels the reading, after which the reader is not fully satisfied.  And, then there are the great novels - look big to easily hold - but worth every page of reading.  [[ASIN:0199232768 War and Peace]], [[ASIN:1466247843 Don Quixote]], [[ASIN:1451635621 Gone with the Wind]] are a few.<br /><br />This is not another of the great novels. This is a very good novel - but the story is difficult to sell.  It is not about the greatest issues of life like pitting man in the most difficult of situations - e.g. war delivering young people into adulthood in nanoseconds.<br /><br />This is about the northeast.  Many may not like that.  It is about tennis bums.  Others may not like that.  It has a lot of social commentary about the people around the main characters which remind me of J.D. Salinger.  Acidic prose of bile cleverly displaying great insight of the corroded mind of the perplexing young man.<br /><br />After reading that last sentence, you may ask yourself - do I want to rifle through hundreds of pages of northeastern establishment sarcasm regarding people in the late 20th century?  And, the insider's angle of this novel is Joyce-esque - a glossary of many pages is at the end of the book to explain names, people, labels and more so that the reader can understand what the colloquial or extremely local references mean.<br /><br />And, as someone who trudged through [[ASIN:0679722769 Ulysses]] and other novels by Joyce, I can say that passages of this meet that high level.  But, when it comes to lying down with a nice book to comfort me during a rainy day - endless pages about neurological paranoia trumped by sarcastic wit and other impersonal characteristics are not what I crave to read in my spare time.  So, like Joyce, this is not a novelist whose works  I seek to dive into.  But, I  must say such a novel is one people should attempt to read.  It is that extremely well written.<br /><br />In the end, I was done.  I am no better a person for having read it, and probably all of my friends have not read it, and a majority of my friends have never heard of it.  And, that is not their loss nor is it my gain.

038572179X|5.0|Sometimes we're fortunate enough to read a book so full of life and living we're nearly suffocated by the weight of it. Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement\\" is such a work. In the pages of \\"Atonement\\" we learn more about protagonists Biony and Cecelian Tallis and their thoughts and motives than we know about members of our own families. In that process, of course, we fear for them, their extended families and the demons of an English village from the second till the fourth quarter of the twentieth century.<br /><br />It is remarkable, too, that author McEwan achieves this task against the backdrop of the most terrible war the world had ever known. Placing the protagonist in nurse's training and hospital nursing, McEwan lets us experience both the horrors of war on its victims and its impact on young caregivers. At the same time, the novel flashes back and forth to the young warriors \\"in the field\\" and the non-combatants also stricken by the massive German attacks (remember, this was the first war to include air bombs and fighter plane strafing).<br /><br />No less amazing, in author McEwan's hands, the tale of mass suffering is in fact the \\"back story\\" in a novel that is about an unsolved murder and a wrongly accused heroic figure, the victim of a neurotic teenager's lies.<br /><br />From beginning to end, \\"Atonement\\" is an astounding tale by a major writer. If you missed this book's early release, get it now. It's likely you'll never forget this one.

0385344325|3.0|Thank you Amazon for sending this new book so fast! As a big Lee Child/Reacher fan I read this one immediately. While generally I love the escapist reading of these novels, and that Reacher is a good and noble hero, I'm beginning to get tired of the same old stuff. By way of background, most of the Reacher books take place after he leaves the army and is on the road going to different towns. This book takes place while he's still in the army, and fills the gap of why he left. Okay, I like that so far. And it's yet another book on corruption he finds when he goes to a small town. Most of the series involves that; yet that's the basis of the genre and acceptable for establishing Reacher's hero actions. Okay, I can live with that too.   Yet there are a few trends that show up in this series that are getting annoying. This book was remarkable for those trends, and not in a good way. Namely, has Reacher ever met a woman he doesn't sleep with? You'd think a character that's supposed to be a hero would have SOME restraint. Nope. And of course EVERY woman he meets is just incredibly gorgeous. A point that Lee Child doesn't let you forget because he goes on and on and onnnnnnnnnn about it. Make me gag. Apparently normal-looking women just don't exist in Reacher's universe. And, big surprise, they're all available. (Like THAT would happen.) While this may be enticing to male readers, female readers like me get pretty tired of this same-old trend, which happens in virtually every book in the series. I think the lack of character-depth in any of these women is insulting. But enough said.  I also note that the Reacher character never, ever makes a false move. Ho hum, that gets pretty boring too. Yes, I know he's supposed to be a hero, but it gets a little eye-rolling that this guy is Superman. A false move that he recovers from would at least be more interesting. Or, imagine, if he actually failed at something!   So clearly I won't be recommending this book to anyone. Yet the earlier Lee Child/Reacher books are well worth recommending. The series is fast escapist reading, until you get tired of the same old stuff.

1594744769|5.0|I am amazed by the number of reviews that treat this book like just some kind of gothic/horror/adventure tale. That's like saying \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is about jewelry.<br /><br />  The actual plot doesn't matter very much. There is a young hero, some gothic elements, some creatures, a bit of a quest, various fantasy elements, a heartthrob, and so on. Perfectly fine, and, if that were all, this would be a generic but reasonably successful fantasy/quest kind of novel. But it is much more - a \\"more\\" that makes it peculiar and special.<br /><br />  The author has gathered together about 50 strange vintage photos. The subjects are of the ineffable, vague, transient, queer, freakish - pick your own adjective for whatever it is that makes a certain photo arresting, strange or memorable. The author has then incorporated the photos into the story so that each photo portrays a character, (perhaps major, perhaps minor), or event, (perhaps major, perhaps minor), that is linked to the development of the overall plot.<br /><br />  When my son was a Cub Scout, his Pack used to have an event involving a \\"genius kit\\". Each kid got a shopping bag full of random stuff, (used paper towel rolls, a windshield wiper, two nickels, and so on.). The Scout had to build something using all of the items, and nothing else except those items and perhaps tape and glue. Well, this book is a genius kit constructed from the vintage photos, using just those photos, imagination, and words.<br /><br />  Does it always work? Of course not. But, when it does work, this is a book you can get lost in, happily.
030788743X|5.0|Quintessential Geek Ernest Cline has woven a story that is almost beyond compare. A tail of nerdom, suspense, and love. Set in a mildly dystopian future, there is a hint of what the world could be - good and bad. Like a good cup a coffee, this debut novel is a fast paced read that is smooth on the digestion. The plot is easy to follow but not to obvious that I was not saying to myself \\"I know where this is going\\". There are may places in the book that seem semi-autobiographic. If you are a fan of gaming you will love this book. There is just enough gaming jargon and subculture terminology that non-gamers will not be lost. The 80's nostalgia is pleasant and made me put the book down a couple times and meditate on some of the things I remember of the that time. This tome made me laugh, cry, and reminisce. I believe this is not the last we will see of Cline and this universe he has woven for the masses.
0439023521|5.0|I'd never heard of The Hunger Games series until I spotted an article on a news website a few days ago.  I decided to see if there was a sample available on Amazon.com so I could see for myself what the fuss was about...and after I read the entire sample online over my lunch break, I knew I had to buy the book.  Even though the book is targeted at a \\"young adult\\" audience, the author doesn't try to gloss over the harrowing events that unfold.  It is refreshing to read a story from a first-person point of view--I was totally wrapped up in Katniss' tale without ever feeling the author's presence invading that space.  Katniss' matter-of-fact approach to the harsh realities of her world were the perfect backdrop for the story--fast-paced and action-filled, to be sure, but with a dark core that will make you pause.  I believe Katniss Everdeen would have made a good companion for Roland the Gunslinger...
0385738765|3.0|This second book in the Maze Runner series is not as straight forward as [[ASIN:B004Z4LVZK The Maze Runner (Maze Runner Trilogy, Book 1)]]. The Scorch Trails is is a pretty quick read full suspenseful plot twist. It takes this story into a place that I believe most readers will not expect. There are a few things that personally bug me. The main character, Thomas, is a little too ignorant in some places than I believe this kid would normally be. In the first book he was built up to be a smart, resourceful young adult with some street smarts. He lacks some of that here. Granted the situations he is in are unusual, but come on, he is not stupid. Overall it is a pretty good read, but I am not as excited to read the last book of the trilogy.  I will probably wait until it is cheaper.

1597801585|5.0|So when I first tried to read this book, I did not get what all the hype was about. When it won the Hugo and Nebula I was shocked!! That got me thinking.  There has to be something to this novel if it won both. Grudgingly and grumbling, I pick it back up. I tried to look at in a different light than I was used to in Sci-Fi.  That did the trick. This book is now one of my favorite books of all time.  I could read it again. Set in a world where oil is a thing of the past and genetic modification is the new weapon, The Windup Girl is a tale of struggle for the individuals who have to live it. There does not seem to be a central, overall plot to the book. This is the reason I struggle with it in the first place. I did not know where to go with it.  Like there was suppose to be an outcome.  There is, but not an outcome that I am used to thinking in. This is adds to this tomes appeal. I had to take a zen approach to it and take every part for what it is at that moment. The characters have their own personality that adds depth to many subplots that make up this book. Their is a tiny hint of the authors personal feelings about regarding certain big businesses that run the world, but not too overt to push away \\"non-believers\\" who don't see it the same way. This book is worth every word and it deserves the recognition it has been given. Kudos to Mr.Bacigalupi.

I will never buy media again. Amazon will always have it available for me to view online or to download. I can also watch episodes online using my Droid 2 using the built in web browser from Google.  Spoiler alert! This episode will leave you demanding more Doctor Who. Matt Smith has really grown into this role and he has been a fine successor to the Dr. Who tradition. Please BBC, give us more.  I love this episode because it keeps you guessing. Steven Moffat still has the touch, although I did prefer his earlier work especially the episode entitled \\"Don't Blink\\" which is my favorite Dr Who episode of them all. Still this one is quite good. The whole season and much earlier seasons with David Tenant leads up to this episode, and you get to find out a bit more about Dr Who and his sweetie, Melody Pond aka River Song.   So the Doctor and River do get hitched, but don't expect the traditional wedding bells. The wedding is ironically connected to his death, or is it? The show is great because it keeps you guessing and besides who doesn't love a romance entwined in an exciting story. The story does jump around a bit, but this is nothing new to fans if the Doctor.   But the question still remains: Dr. Who?
B005804NCI|5.0|when i got the shm-cd import of rumours i did'nt think i needed this one, but i compared the super audio and it sounded more balanced. i still like both. but i do love this upgrade and plan on getting more.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|For being a cheaper case I cannot believe how much I love it. It offers protection without taking away from the looks of my phone.  It also came with an excellent screen protector.  I bought a zagg screen protector with my phone because best buy sort of pushed me into it and I regret that so much.  That protector was expensive and awful but this one you can not even tell that it is on my phone.  I love everything about this purchase!  Thank you amazon.
B0042EJD8A|4.0|The movie was very creatively made, and although it is a little slow with all the personal testimonies, it's worth seeing as an introduction to the dangers of fracking.
0375836675|4.0|I am not a student of literature; just like to read good books.  This is a good one.  No way to explain it except as a myth; it could never happen.  I liked the ending, contrary to some of the reviewers.  He helps a lot of people, he gets the girl and the angel/guy walks off into the sunset and I'm left with the message that a person of worthless ordinariness can be transformed into a person of value if you will spend some time helping your fellow creatures. Sermonizing?  So what? It got a little tiresome, but maybe because I read it too fast.  - - Ed W.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I just finished watching all 6 movies and absolutely loved them!    The quality of video in 1-3 was stunning...and since the video was shot in digital, it makes sense.  4-6 was less impressive but still a big improvement over DVD.  The little part in \\"Return\\" where Darth yells \\"NO\\" was fitting and a perfect change...not sure what the hullabaloo was all about.  To all the people that cried over that one little part, GROW UP!    To everyone else, buy the blu-ray.  It is a steal of a deal!
0385534639|3.0|I don't want to be overly critical because this is such an imaginative book, but even though I loved the circus (and all of the descriptions of the tents - amazing!), I was disappointed and confused by the ending.  And in the end I wasn't sure I was that crazy about Marco.  All in all, in spite of some inconsistencies and confusion, I'd definitely recommend reading this book.  Erin Morgenstern has painted such a beautiful world.  I really do hope she writes a sequel so she can \\"iron out\\" some issues and also because there's so much more I'd love to find out about the characters.  She spent so much time describing her fantastical and glorious circus that the characters weren't fleshed out as much as I would have liked them to be.  Of course the main character in this book is the circus, but it can't function without those who perform in it, run it, and love it, so the characters are definitely worthy of attention as well.  Last but not least, this is going to be an amazing movie!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The prequels are worthless and the Original trilogy has been butchered beyond recognition . Even the DVD release of the unaltered trilogy with it's poor quality is better than this blu-ray release .
B0053TMP24|5.0|Just like all other books from Rick Riordan, The On of Neptune is a great book! One problem is that it has way too many typos.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Works great so far on HTC Thunderbolt.  Can grab pics from gallery to alter or take them with this app.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I can't beleive how realistic the sketch mode is.  Best camera filter app yet.  Will get a lot of use out of this.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|At first I thought, great another camera app. But I downloaded it anyway. And I was amazed at the quality of the different types of filters. And yes, you can pull up your old pictures and apply the effects.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|first of all to the people giving bad reviews...its called paper &quot;CAMERA&quot; (so it takes pictures, not apply the filters to pics in the gallery)....anyways this is a cool app and i really like the idea of that other person, where you ccould take videos with the filters on...please make that happen, it would be so much fun
0316098329|5.0|It was cleverly written and heartwarming. The two halves of the book are fairly different, but equally enjoyable. In terms of narration, this is a landmark book and should be required reading for any writing class.
B000002G23|5.0|Overall a classic band, all together in one set at a great price. Music and lyrics that have truly stood the test of time.
1932100385|5.0|The book was created to aim the regular reading person, very easy and clear down to earth, regular vocabulary, plenty of arguments and information on how we can improve our health and why what we are eating now is not a good choice for our body.<br />After reading all the experiments and information, pages after pages I definitely changed my opinion about what we (my family) put in our mouth every day and I am ready for the big change, looking forward to find new vegan delicious recipes.<br />Best Regards to the authors, finally somebody who stands against the big money powers and tried to tell the truth for people who wants to hear!<br />Just my regrets that I found the book 6 years later.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is a well executed photo filter app. I am tempted to import some of the photos taken with my digital camera and edit them with Paper Camera.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOST! is over, but still lives on in the form of this awesome BLURAY set. A MUST OWN for any fan of the show.  Shows lately have been trying to copy but they are falling short. LOST is, was, and always will be the BEST SHOW ON TV ever--and you can't tell me anything different. Some people say it ended poorly, but by the very fact that the ending was being debated tells all that it did its job and ended GREAT!  When I begin to miss those intriguing and crazy island days...I pop in a disc and all is well. I only wish I could watch it like I did for the FIRST TIME all over again!
B005CMGKTG|3.0|I was surprised at how faithful the 2010 live-action SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO movie was to the old anime--right down to the soundtrack. Many of the supporting characters get short-shrift, but that's to be expected when a 26-episode series is adapted into a movie running a bit over two hours long. It's more surprising that a number of minor characters do get their moments to shine.  The effects are more than adequate and seem to be a bit influenced by U.S. science-fiction shows like BABYLON 5 and the remake of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. At the sema time, the Yamato is completely recognizable, like an old friend who I haven't seen in years.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|The 3d version pops out at you in so many areas you really can FEEL the love tonight... Not as great as Beauty and the Beast 3D, but still very good.  Makes you wish we had 3D in many other Disney movies---which I am sure is coming soon a couple at a time of course.  Get this movie today and watch it with your kids, you won't be disappointed!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|OK for all purposes other then just taking normal photos ......this app beats out all others in quality, presentation,  and ease of use! get it while its free!! it is worth paying for!
B003BWQEU4|5.0|This movie is a GREAT MOVIE and in BLU RAY it is even GREATER! YOU MUST see DUMBO on BLU RAY and ensure this movie gets into the hands of all kids in all generations!  DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
B005BDZLYQ|5.0|I ordered this because several of these albums/CD's are out of print and hard to find. To be honest I was not expecting much, due to the high volume of music and low price. I won't go into the details of Hank Mobley, in my mind one of the top horn players of the great Blue Note era. I was familiar with Roll Call and Soul Station two five star recordings (check the Amazon reviews). I was extremly pleased with the music (it is Hank Mobley after all) as well as the packaging. The sound quality was also a pleasant suprise. Within a week of buying this I purchased music from Red Garland and Lou Donaldson on the same label.
B004WE01YA|5.0|WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!! All I can say is that it was like this movie had been made just yesterday specifically for the 3D format.  The Chandelier hanging from the ceiling during the ballroom dance scene will take your breath away.  The entire first song where Belle is making her way through the town sets the pace and continues to deliver all the way through the movie...from a checkerboard hurtling your way to a knife poking a character as you slide with it down the banister...Beauty and the Beast is probably one of the best 3D movies I have seen in this format.  The best part is at the end when Beast is transforming into a human, the lighted floor REALLY LOOKS REAL due to the intense 3D Visual.  A must own for any 3D OWNER!!
0425098478|5.0|I bought this as a required reading for a promotional exam. It did its job and was a pretty good read as well.
0553801473|5.0|I was just dying to read this book. Lord knows I waited long enough. It is AMAZING and just makes you crave for the author to FINISH THE STORY!!!
0140449337|5.0|Marcus Aurelius was Roman emperor from around 161-180 AD. He wrote some of this from the battlefield. Keep that in mind as you read it.<br /><br />Because you have to read it. (it's easy to read at any rate)
B0047X4926|5.0|Correct submission, in due course, packaging perfectly, and very happy with the purchase. Amazon.com a 10 for the second time! Very happy with purchase.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|The sketch up setting is awesome. I have never seen a result this good before...... Got as free app of the day.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Another great album from Gaga!!!! This album definitely has a great sound to it! There are definitely plenty of songs to dance to, and she also delivers powerful messages!
B005J0VPNC|3.0|something fishy is going on. making this free drives up the number of downloads which raises the app in the rankings. this creates a brief buying frenzy when no longer free.   slow claps........
B002QGUFWE|5.0|This album is simply amazing! Every song is catchy and Lady Gaga is one awesome chick! I love a lot of her songs that have never been on the radio!
0385335997|2.0|I enjoyed the book until it got to the ending. It seemed as though she tried to get too much material into it. What was with the voodoo stuff?  What was the purpose of the minister who ended up a serial killer?  Too much for me. I couldn't wait to finish it and not in a good way. I'm hoping the rest of the books will be better.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Just what I needed!!  I ordered this adapter to connect my Canon camcorder to my iMac computer.  The shipping was very fast, packaging was excellent and the adapter worked like a charm.  All I had to do was plug it in to the camcorder and back of my iMac and I was set to upload my movies!  No problems, whatsoever!  Thank you, amazon.com, for solving my problem!!!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is one of the coolest camera app out there love how you can go back and edit the photos you already have awesomeness
055357342X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this edition of the Song of Ice and Fire series.  In fact, I found this one to be better than Clash of Kings, yet not as powerful as Game of Thrones.  The treachery that plays out in this volume is phenomenal.  Cersei really allows her true colors to shine through, and shows how all she really cares about power and control.  The Starks are once again targeted, however I won't share by whom or why.  Tyrion continues to make enemies and continues to scrape by with his life.  I wish there was more feature on his character b/c he is my absolute favorite.  Danearys really become more of a central character in this book.  Before this book I hated her chapters.  They never really went anywhere, but here she takes on a larger role that is really interesting.  Her character develops into one in which there is actual interest in what happens to it (for me anyway), instead of something I must read through to get to the next chapter.  Jaime gets a lot of focus in this book, as does Brieanne of Tarth, both of which are really fun characters to follow.  Finally, Jon does a lot in this installment, and there's a lot of excitement associated with his character.<br /><br />There was one drawback for me, and that was there seemed to be some convenience added to make things work.  For instance, some characters, who started hundreds of leagues apart, where in the same places at the same time.  This makes the story work, but it's always something that I've had a hard time with in literature.  This isn't the first book to do this, nor will it be the last.<br /><br />Now, on to Feast of Crows.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|One of my favorite apps already. Really cool effects! I wish I could rate this app even higher. This is a MUST buy.
B00005O438|5.0|I am a long time fan of thriller movies.  This movie with out all the slasher effects is the scariest movie I have ever seen.
0142419400|1.0|Well, I don't even know what to say about this one because it I rarely talk about books that I didn't enjoy. However, so many people loved Anna and the French Kiss while I had such a strong dislike that I feel like I should explain why it didn't work for me.<br />But be warned, this has spoilers so do not read on if you don't like spoilers of any kind<br />*<br />*<br />*spoiler alert!!<br />*<br />*<br />Basically I didn't like the cheating that the two main characters do and how it was handled. And before someone tries to say \\"but wait, they didn't cheat!\\" read the book again. Because Etienne even admits to cheating on page 363 (in hardcover edition).<br /><br />Etienne: \\"I'm saying I'm in love with you! I've been in love with you this whole bleeding year!\\"<br /><br />Anna: My mind spins. \\"But Ellie-\\"<br /><br />Etienne: \\"I cheated on her every day. In my mind, I thought of you in ways I shouldn't have, again and again. She was nothing compared to you. I've never felt this way about anybody before-\\"<br /><br />And although he only admits to the emotional cheating and denies \\"actual cheating\\" in that same conversation, he does pursue Anna, flirtatiously touch her, and even spent several nights sleeping in same bed with her (though they do not have sexual contact) while still in the relationship with his long-term girlfriend Ellie. This kind of intimacy and emotional cheating just threw me completely! I didn't like that the storyline seemed to try and make all of it okay, or that major distress in life like a family member with cancer made Etienne's indiscretions logical or understandable.<br />I was kind of okay with the character of Anna because she at least tries to do the right thing, but even so it wasn't enough for me to be okay with the story. I hated Etienne for his leading on of girls! He leads on not only Anna, but also his long term girlfriend who he cheats on emotionally and physically (kissing Anna, sleeping in her room, flirty touches in movie theater etc), and also leads on a friend named Meredith with a crush on him!<br />As pointed out in excerpt below by Rashmi(page 315 hardcover) :<br /><br />Anna: \\"I wasn't thinking, it just happened. I've ruined everything.<br />She hates me. Etienne hates me!\\"<br /><br />Josh: \\"St. Clair definitely doesn't hate you,\\" Josh says.<br /><br />Rashmi: \\"Though if I were Mer, I'd hate him.\\" Rashmi scowls. \\"He's been leading her on for way too long.\\"<br /><br />Josh is indignant. \\"He's never once given her the impression that he liked her more than a friend.\\"<br /><br />Rashmi: \\"Yeah but he's never discouraged her!\\"<br /><br />Josh: \\"He's been dating Ellie for a year and a half. You'd think that'd be discouragement enough-oh. Sorry, Anna.\\"<br /><br />Anna: I sob harder.<br /><br />I just could not get past all of these infidelities that happen repeatedly because of Etienne. And in my opinion, cheating is cheating no matter if it's emotional or physical in form. So yeah, I think he's a douche LOL<br />But I do also want to share what I did like about the book: I loved the details of Paris and SOAP, which is the school they attend there. The atmosphere and little details of French life for an American were fun to read about, and I enjoyed Anna's descriptions of how she navigated the new school and then a new and foreign city. And I liked that she was self-aware enough to know that her problems (of having to go to boarding school in Paris and liking an unavailable boy) were not on the same scale as others but also was still able to recognize and feel her feelings of loneliness and deal with them.<br />Overall, while I didn't like the book, I know a lot of others will and I hope that you'll check it out and decide for yourself if you think Etienne is swoon-worthy or not. And I'm actually looking forward to giving Lola and the Boy Next Door a try. I'm curious to see what happens there and if Stephanie is one of those hit and miss authors for me.As pointed out in excerpt below by Rashmi(page 315 hardcover) :  Anna: \\"I wasn't thinking, it just happened.

1594744769|4.0|Wow! What a pleasant surprise this book turned out to be. The old adage don't judge a book by it's cover is definitely pertinent for this book. When I first saw the cover I thought, I don't want to read that book it is probably some creepy, horror story. You do have to admit the cover is a little disturbing, Then I started seeing all to the positive reviews and thought I would give it a whirl. I am so glad I did. The story was so creative and different. I throughly enjoyed it until the always disappointing cliffhanger ending!<br />What I liked:<br />*This book is mysterious from page one. You are not certain where the story is going to take you but you are sucked right in as you begin on an intriguing adventure. The book moves at the perfect pace not too fast or slow but just enough to keep the reader hooked.<br />*All the different facets of the story; such as peculiar orphans each with their own unique talent, shape shifters, monsters, temporal distortions and adventure.<br />*I loved meeting each of the orphans and discovering their special talents. From the invisible boy to the floating girl they were all interesting. Not to mention they each had their own vintage photo.<br />*The time loop was such a different aspect that was integral to the story.<br />*The photos were a pleasing and unconventional aspect to this book. I was surprised when I read the author's note at the end regarding the photos. They are actual vintage photos from various flea markets and other interesting places.<br />*The language and writing in this book are superb. The author has a way with words that is mesmorizing. I was completely enamoured by his descriptions.<br />*The main character Jacob, I adored this sarcastic teenager, he had me laughing out loud at his numerous snarky comments. I was pleased to monitor his growth throughout the book.<br /><br />And the not so much:<br />*The cliffhanger ending of course, I had a sinking feeling as I neared the end of the book that I was in for the disappointment of non-resolution. To make matters worse there was no mention of this being a series so I was not prepared for the ending.<br />*Unfortunately reading this book on a Kindle does not do it justice. The photos and letters are difficult to discern on the Kindle's screen. This is a book that you should read the physical copy. They are too many details that you cannot absorb on the Kindle or any electronic reader.<br />* I was sad that I didn't get to spend more time with the Grandfather character in this book. Especially when you discover all of his secrets and personality dimensions. Perhaps there will be more of him in an upcoming book.<br /><br />Final thoughts this is definitely a must read book in my opinion. I throughly enjoyed the book until the abrupt ending. The writing is absolutely amazing, truly my favorite part of the book. This is an innovative story and I am hoping for the continuation in the near future. It would have been a five star read if not for the cliffhanger ending.<br />Addendum: After finishing the book and my review yesterday I was curious about a sequel so I visited Mr. Riggs website [...] ; he notes that there is a sequel coming but it sounds as if it is going to be awhile!on.

0385342055|4.0|I enjoy Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series. I am enjoying this book so far.  It is interesting to read about her daughter and how she still has her shopping habits.
B0053TMP24|5.0|After months of waiting, Rick Riordan is back with the thrilling second installment to his &#34;Heroes of Olympus&#34; saga. For anyone who has either seen the Percy Jackson movie or read all the books, catcch up with your favorite demigod in Riordan's newest series! I also recommend his Kane Chronicles series as well- based on the Egyptian gods and goddesses with a few references to Percy Jackson. If you have a mythology class *coughcough* you can safely say you know your Graeco-Roman gods & goddesses thanks to Percy Jackson & Riordan! I did!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very well done. At first it seems almost too easy, but quickly becomes a challenge to get the fewest moves. Addictive, good replay value. Love it!
B0035V35P8|1.0|This movie is really really terrible. I saw it before moving to South Korea, before I ever heard of Rain. And it does nothing to make the venerated Korean celebrity look good. Having watched this in a theater in the US, and then watched really good Korean movies in Korea, I must say this film does a major disservice to the blossoming Korean movie industry by being a terrible example of Korean film exports. Waste of time, and money. If they had spent a fraction of the budget they blew on fake blood on hiring actual script writers to create a plot it might be slightly watchable. As it is this is a gory schlock-fest with no redeeming qualities.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I seriously can't stop playing with this app! I've tried numerous other camera apps, but none have had consistently amazing results like Paper Camera. I agree with a previous comment, however - video mode would be epic!!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Looking at the world through this app is trippy!! Turns a regular HD photo into an artsy HD project. I love it! Can't find anything like this anywhere... Can't wait for more styles.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I received this item in a timely manner and in the condition it said it was.  I will order stuff from amazon again.  Thanks Amazon.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I wrote this review for the B-sides CD but it applies here as well.<br /><br />Florence + The Machine have been on my \\"to buy\\" list for some time now, but I have always been a little reluctant to take the plunge. However, today I did, and I'm thoroughly impressed. I'm not sure what I expected, but they are better than I expected. I believe I read a review that compared them to Paramour, that's not even close. F+M have far more musicality. I sense aspects of Lady Gaga, even though I am not a fan of hers, but it's very subtle, probably more in the theatrics than anything. However, I do hear shades of Annie Lennox and certainly aspects of Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders, not only in the vocals, but in the music as well. The nod to Robert Palmer's Addicted to Love is priceless. Needless to say I'm pleasantly surprised and have been wearing out the grooves in the MP3 album since I downloaded it.<br /><br />This part only applies to the B-sides CD:<br /><br />I might also add that this is the first download  I have gotten from Amazon that actually came with the digital booklet. So what's up with that Amazon? I see these digital booklets offered with a multitude of digital downloads and this is the only one that it actually came with the download. I think you've been holding out on us.<br /><br />Tremendous thumbs up to F+M for making this happen. The digital booklet is a great extra, vivid color photographs of Florence and the band as well as lyric annotations to the images and liner notes.  Thanks for thinking of your fans, because you have a new one in me and I'm looking forward to the next release.
B004G8QHKO|5.0|Back in the 90's I listened strictly to rock- alternative, punk, metal, anything as long as it was rock. I fell out of this the past decade or so, as the rock bands just aren't that great anymore. Lately I'd been listening to just about everything except rock.  This band gives me hope.  I say they're a rock band because 1. that's what they call themselves according to their interview; and 2. they actually list Nine Inch Nails as one of their big influences, and I actually can see that in their music--along with some other 80s/90s sounds like Souxie and the Banshees and Smashing Pumpkins. Although not as dark as NIN, they do have more of a traditional \\"band\\" sound than MGMT or some of the others they're being compared to. I may not have cared for all the synth as much 10 years ago, but maybe listening to more electronica and house/dance lately has turned me to it. In any case, if this is the direction of new alternative I like it.  I'm seeing them live in 2 weeks and I really hope they're as good in person; that will win them a fan for life. It's nice to come back to my favorite genre of music.
1400077915|5.0|Rarely am I displeased with a book by Ms. Munroe, and this one was no exception. If you have read other loosely connected short stories of her this one will not disappoint. One of the most insightful (especially regarding the female experience) and prolific writers of this century.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|The usual action scenes, but ridiculous plot holes.  The vast majority of the plot points made no sense whatsoever, I think Michael Bay is trying to make the worst possible movie that still makes millions of dollars.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|App has some cool effects, but you can't &quot;edit&quot; anything already in gallery, new pictures only. If it could do that, I'd give it 5*.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Great free app. Not the most flexible camera for Android, but has some unique filters that can be quickly accessed. Loud shutter click. Recommend as app to complement an Android photo tools collection.
B0057XSCJG|4.0|I liked Beastly a lot more than I thought. It started slow, with a few eye-rolling moments... but by the middle of the movie I was hooked. I think Vanessa Hudgens is an underrated actress, which probably puts me in the minority. I hope she can shed her HSM past and take more adult roles. This is also the best performance I've seen from Alex Pettyfer. His \\"ugly\\" self must have inspired him.
0393340244|2.0|This book while interesting should be viewed with an eye to the scientific evidence, generated for centuries in laboratory animal models and largely ignored by the text.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|Halfway through and I can go on no longer. Nothing has happened and judging from other reviews nothing continues to happen. The breaking point for me was one too many pages of useless whining from some female dwarf that Tyrion meets; yes, another throwaway minor character that GRRM seems strangely fascinated by. Sadly, I don't share his fascination, and no longer care about this series, which has degenerated into a strange combination of travelogue, torture porn, and food criticism.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is amazing.  I love this app.  It certainly gets your creative juices flowing.  Many different ways to see your world. I've started using it right away. There is a way to do Gallery pics.  I just wish it had a feature for displaying some people like the witches they are.  Oh well, maybe next version. ;)
B005J0VPNC|4.0|I really like the effects, but it's pretty sparse on options!  Why can't I save the real photo at the same time?  Adding effects to pre-existing photos is nice, but using the real time viewfinder AND getting a real photo and paper photo with one click would be much nicer.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|I bought this Blu-ray disc after purchasing a 1080p plasma TV and Blu-ray player.  All I can say is that this movie continues to amaze me the more I watch it.  Special effects done over 20 years ago were optics and models, and they appear just as crisp and clean as anything computer generated would appear now.  I can't believe how the images constantly jump off the screen at me, and the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is just as amazing as the visuals.  My only complaint is that the movie starts playing with a default Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack when I pop it in my player, and I have to manually use a pop-up menu to choose the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.  It seems that with lossless soundtracks being the default standard for 99.99% of Blu-ray releases that the TrueHD soundtrack would be the first one to start playing on any machine (as all Blu-ray machines can down-mix that soundtrack to standard Dolby Digital for receivers that don't support TrueHD).

0670022950|5.0|Pinker's book begins with a bang, \\"This book is about the most important thing that has ever happened in human history\\": the shockingly sharp historical decline in violence.  I was struck, in reading this, by how much daring it takes to actually say something optimistic. Pinker's point is something like this: \\"I hate to be a killjoy, but the world is actually not going to hell in a hand basket. These are not the worst of times. When it comes to the likelihood of being a victim of violence in ANY form, we are living in the very best of times.\\" Pinker defends his arguments entertainingly and with a great weight of supporting evidence.<br /><br />This book will permanently change our discourse about violence. It is, in other words, an instant classic.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This does what it says, applies filters to your photos. There is some tweaking you can do as well. It does an ok job doing this too - better than other similar programs I've tried. However, I rarely ever want to mess up my pictures like that. Unless they are already blurry, or I need to protect someones identity, I just wouldn't do this on my phone. Photoshop on my computer does better, obviously. But that may not always be the case as Android gets more powerful and on bigger devices. I grabbed it while on sale for this purpose. Plan to uninstall, but who knows in the future.

It seems that each of the negatives listed in other reviews have been addressed and corrected/updated in a new version of the app. (Notice none of those reviews are recent.)

B003L77G2Y|5.0|We discovered Fringe early this summer when we bought Season 1 on a clearance sale at a local retailer.  Since then, we've acquired Seasons 2 and 3 - and are now affirmatively hooked.  The series has a very dark (albeit far-fetched) premise - with the structure of the Universe having been damaged by a grief-damaged genius who stole his dead son's exact counterpart from another universe (leaving the matching family childless).  But it makes up for that darkness with a profound sense of humor - mostly involving Walter (John Noble's) quirks and periodic lapses into lunacy.  Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson do a great job at being the new Mulder-Scully combo, and they have a great spark as they solve 'fringe' science mysteries of all types and flavors.  With good writing, good acting, and well-conceived stories - Fringe is great fun for anyone who likes sci-fi/horror entertainment.  As long as you're over 11 or 12 - as there is something disturbing shown at the start of each show (usually involving Walter's bemused smirk as he pokes around in the gooo of some fringe event's detritis)!

B001P5HI4A|4.0|You have to be in the mood for this one. (I bought it for my wife). When it was first released, some 20+ years ago, it was called \\"Fiddler on the Tootsie\\" or \\"Funny Girl Meets Tootsie\\" by the critics.  Barbra never really looks male, so you have to go with \\"poetic license\\" to enjoy this film!  Some of the \\"songs\\" are quite repetitious in melody which can by annoying (think \\"Phantom\\") and act as plot exposition. Some of the songs are knockouts.  The photography is great, and Amy Irving steals every scene she appears in. A good DVD transfer (2008 release).  Yentl may be \\"too ethnic\\" for some people and does not have the universal appeal of \\"Funny Girl\\" as it focuses on Jewish religion and rituals and is considered more of a \\"woman's romance film.\\" That is probably why it took so many years to be finally released on DVD video.

B003YLK2RI|5.0|First off, I'm a 47 year old male.  I LIKE these guys, but I'm certainly no ate-up, hardcore maggot.  It's just that, there are days where I have an itch and these guys are the cure to what ails me.  To me, they're hit and miss.  Some of their CDs are great, some aren't so hot.  The same goes with their DVD's.  \\"Behind the nine\\" was, IMHO, a miss.  Great interviews, but I wanted music, not art.  \\"DISASTERPIECES\\" was a hit.  Honestly, I didn't think they could top that.  It had what I wanted.  BUT........this one, (sic)nesses, is top-shelf stuff.  Being an outdoor concert, I didn't expect too much.  I was wrong.  The camerawork is excellent and very clear.  Good angles and pan shots.  But, what REALLY impressed me, was the SOUND. I appreciate a good mix on a concert DVD, but it's usually too much guitar, or too much audience.  This one is spot on.  Not only can you HEAR Joey and his ridiculously fast feet, but you can FEEL them.  If you have any sort of surround system with reasonable subs, you WILL irritate the neighbors.  This one is a 'must have', whether you're a hardcore fan or not.

B0045QE3GM|3.0|I have to agree with the other reviewers who expressed disappointment in the sound quality of Olympia. The mix is dull and lifeless. Unfortunately, my impression so far is that the songs are not much better than that. A couple of the better songs, like Alphaville, might have been worthy of B-sides on an album like Bete Noire or Taxi, so if you're a rabid Ferry fan you should probably own this album. Otherwise, I wouldn't put it at the top of your shopping list, sorry to say.

This album was a big part of the soundtrack of that summer, along with \\"Mothership Connection\\", but that discussion is for another review. \\"Baby, I Love Your Way' was everywhere, you couldn't escape it, not that I wanted to, because I was also in love. \\"Show Me The Way\\" was jammin' and of course, \\"Do You Feel Like We Do\\" was a great stoner song. But the other tracks made me appreciate Frampton as a legit artist. \\"Lines On My Face\\", I still hear that song in my head. \\"Something's Happening\\", I loved Frampton's ringing guitar sound. Just a great, great album for its time. Time of your life, Eh Kid?

B001MYIXAW|5.0|What can be said about this that hasn't already? Let the Right One is a perfect film. It's beautifully shot, has a great story and fantastic performances from its two lead actors Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson. It moves at a somewhat deliberate pace in comparison to your average American horror film, but you will still find yourself engrossed. It's probably one of the best vampire stories I have ever seen, whittling the mythos down to the barest of essentials as well as giving a new twist on the 'rules' (what happens if a vampire enters a dwelling that it was not invited to?). The word 'vampire' is only mentioned once in the entire film. If you're looking for a straight-up horror film you will likely be disappointed, as the film is not particularly scary; the focus is largely on the relationship between the two kids with much of the horrific content happening sporadically. It is however a very haunting and moving experience that you won't soon forget.<br /><br />The only real criticism I can give it is, as an adaptation of the original book by John Ajvide Lindqvist (who writes the screenplay), it drops the ball on some plot points. In particular, there is one jarring shot that will likely confuse some viewers if they don't know its proper context. Granted, many have been able to pick up on what it means, but there's still a chance that you will be left in the dark. That being said, worse case scenario is that you end up reading the book to understand the film better, which you should either way. Lindqvist still delivers a pitch-perfect script on every other level.<br /><br />That being said, I would recommend fans import the UK Blu-ray disc from Amazon.co.uk over the US disc. It's region-free, so it will work on any US player. The biggest plus is that it comes with an exclusive commentary track from Lindqvist and director Tomas Alfredson that the Magnolia disc lacks. In addition, it's guaranteed to have the proper subtitles, whereas there's a chance one might still stumble upon an earlier version of the US disc that has the poorly translated ones. Both versions have the deleted scenes, although they're presented in HD with the UK disc and SD in the US disc. If features don't matter to you, the US disc still delivers the film in a high quality presentation in terms of picture and audio, but fans will gain more from the international release.n earlier version of the US disc that has the poorly translated ones.

B000001EKX|5.0|Recorded at a time when Kiss seemed scary and bigger than life.  This isn't like the post 78 stuff. This is worthy of any true rock fans attention. It has a grunge like street feel to it .  Kiss was a tight cohesive band at this time.  Mean and lean.  Songs such as Parasite, Going Blind, Strange Ways and Watchin You are standouts.  Only issue is production.  I think a previous reviewer nailed it on the head when he said the drums sound  like they were recorded under water.  I do enjoy that it doesn't sound so clean and polished but it would be great if the studio tapes were found, used and remixed. They maybe be able to reduce the amount  of reverb that may have been added to the mix and bring the sound out more making it sound a bit more warm and less tinny. I wonder if Kiss had broken up after Alive if their reputation would have been better and similar to the stooges, Sex Pistols and others who only released a few albums before they burned out. Check this album out if you have any preconceived Ideas about Kiss. This may change your mind.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth shines in this gem of a film. I can see why he won an Oscar for his performance. It's a peek behind the royal curtains just prior to WWII...and a poingnant look at the effects of a speech impedement on a future king. I highly recommend it.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I recently bought a TV that only has optical digital output.  I wasn't prepared to buy yet another home theater system for $400 so I spent $30 for this and an optical cable on Amazon and hooked it up.  I didn't realize that optical cables have some kind of plastic cap that has to be removed so oops, I thought I almost broke it or thought it was junk but once the caps came off, it all worked.  Can't fault the product for what I didn't know.  Works as advertised, comes with a power adapter (mini USB).  I wish it had an auto off or something but for the cheap price I can't complain.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|I would rate this game a 4.5 since there is no .5 scale here, I am willing to give it a 5 for the two gems.  ICO slightly disappointed me for it's visual representation. I have to be honest, this does not look \\"that\\" better than it's original PS2 version. Instead, the old ample feeling now becomes a little empty after the graphics remastering. I have to say I think they could have done a better job adding more details and texture.  On the other hand, SotC managed to excite me once more. The boss fights are awesome up to nowaday standards. I won't spoil it for you, one of the boss fight (hint: flying, sands) is the best I have encountered in my whole gaming career (yeah let's call it a career).   A lot of games in the new gen have been inspired by these two master creation. GoW, UC series, even games like LBP2 have their own reflection of the two games. ICO has brought the brilliant mode of AI computer co-op and deep relation between the player and an AI character. SotC shined with all original large scale magnificent boss fights. They are stunning. And over the top, you have two worlds that will put you in and make you feel.   Must-buy if you are true gamer

B002Q9VPFM|5.0|Everything about this movie is amazing and more. The black freighter is a \\"pirate story\\" (don't want to give too much away) that is animated to life whenever the boy is reading  the comic, and it can feel unnecessary if you saw this on television and wanted to watch it that way. This is the 5 disc set with the full story (Black Freighter is intertwined with the movie) and you cannot choose to opt out. If you really want the fullness of the movie, just bear with the \\"interrupting story\\". You will not be disappointed!

B001AQO3WY|4.0|I have seen numerous war films and TV series and was on the search for a more realistic version of the war. I have to admit that I hated this series in the beginning. I am by no means a prude but some of the things that were said even had me going Whoa! These guys are a**holes! But after that 1st episode, it grabbed my attention and never let go. I have never been in the military, but come from a military family, with my son being the latest recruit. This series showed the true grit, attitude, boredom, tediousness and, yes, bravery of a Marine's deployment. It was very interesting to see the various reactions to the same bad and sometimes horrifying circumstances. Some handled it by keeping it inside, some took it out on others, some became better men because of it. This series showed the dilemmas faced by these guys, the confusion that occurs during battle, the endless waiting that goes on, the frustration of waiting to receive permission to shoot the enemy, and the amazing way that most of them retain their sense of humor through it all. The one thing that really opened my eyes was imagining how these guys felt helping and herding the civilians through the streets and always wondering who or what may be concealing a bomb. Imagine helping these people carry their belongings (luggage, bags, etc.) never knowing if it was going to blow you to bits.  I have the utmost respect for anyone, be it a Marine, soldier, or Airman, that has had to participate in this ugly war. I highly recommend this series to get a feel for what it's really like for our warriors over there.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I've been an Austen fanatic for years, reading all of her books at least twice and watching each movie, with the exception of the adaptations from the 1940s, with rapt attention. Persuasion was the second J.A. book I read and I've always been very fond of it. I also accept that no movie or TV adaptation will truly live up to my expectations. However, this one was particularly disappointing. Anne was portrayed in a meek, miserable manner which really irritated me since she's supposed to be quietly strong and moral. The rest of the Elliot family was so unimpressive I can't actually comment about them (I hardly even remember them). I did like that they quoted the book since Austen's narrative is both insightful and witty. However, over all, the film gave the impression that the screen writers watched the Amanda Root version [[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]] instead of actually reading the book. In fact, they even used the running scene from the '95 version, which I hated by the way. It was very disappointing with few redeemable qualities.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Wow. I wasn't expecting much, maybe just a few affects that would be decent. But let me tell you, I was wrong to expect so little. This app is pretty amazing. I can't wait to take it outside and take a zillion pics. Thanks for such a great artistic camera app.
0545259088|3.0|Okay, I guess it's really not fair of me to give this series such a low review because I am not the target audience.  I am a 34 year old woman but I love the Twilight series so I'll admit that I was hoping for a little more of the same.  So.....to kind of balance that fact out I just gave this book an average review when truthfully I wanted to give it one star.  To me, this is a Twilight wannabe.  I am sure that sentence enrages thousands of tweens and their moms across Amazon.  I just felt like the plot, writing and characters were very basic and watered down.  I was so bored by this series.  So....if you are an escapist adult looking for something fun to read....keep looking!

1423140591|5.0|Percy Jackson has no idea who he is. Where he has come from. What has happened the past sixteen years of his life. All he knows is that an unnamed force keeps drawing him south. Drawing him to a place where Roman demigods -- children of the Roman gods and humans -- train for battle against any foe that might threaten Camp Jupiter. Percy arrives, and soon finds himself thrown in with the outcasts -- a bumbling would-be soldier named Frank, and a mysterious, and somewhat deadly girl named Hazel. And now, the three of them have to embark on a quest to save Camp Jupiter from the evil threatening to erase Rome's mark from history forever. The only problem is: the mission is suicidal. Because all of them -- Percy, Frank, and Hazel -- have been destined to die.<br /><br />Rick Riordan's return to the world of Percy Jackson and the Olympian gods is a very welcome one. Riordan knows exactly what he's doing as he leads Percy through danger after danger. Long gone are the days of random Greek monsters cropping up to fill in the action. Riordan uses every encounter for a reason -- to build up the quite complicated characters, or to deliver some devastating plot twists. With THE SON OF NEPTUNE, book two in the HEROES OF OLYMPUS, Riordan definitely delivers more of his trademark myth and mystery.<br /><br />Once again, Riordan splits up the chapters between his three lead characters -- each chapter from one of their points of view. And unlike with THE LOST HERO, where I found myself slightly annoyed (wanting to get back to my favorite character), in this book, it seemed to work much more seemlessly. All three characters are highly enjoyable, and fun to follow along as they deal with their own demons of the past.<br /><br />Frank Zhang and Hazel Levesque, two new characters to this novel, provide some very interesting character arcs for Riordan to explore. Percy has been through so much character development, that most of his time is spent on action or developing more of the overarcing plot of the series. But Frank and Hazel are very different. And their pasts and ancestry were quite intriguing as Riordan laces their storylines throughout. They both felt like very real characters, dealing with very real emotions, although Piper and Hazel did seem somewhat similar in ways -- both tortured and guilty. Frank's character arc is perhaps the strongest, and as the reader comes to the end of the story, it's hard not to feel some emotion throughout his development.<br /><br />The action is top-notch as usual, with some shining scenes near the beginning of the book regarding Camp Jupiter's war games. Riordan really lets loose giving us some super fun stuff to follow -- and it felt very cinematic as the pages and battle shrapnel flew. It was hard not to read through those chapters without a big smile at just how fun the entire book begins. Things do darken up by the end, and leave it hanging for the next installment, THE MARK OF ATHENA. It was hard not to turn the last page and wish the next book was within easy reach.<br /><br />Humor is something that Riordan also does well, and some of the stuff he comes up with this time had me bursting out laughing. From hippie goddesses to a very interesting take on Amazon.com itself, to some typical Percy-like sarcasm and a couple of cracks against Harry Potter perhaps, he's really done his best to give us a good laugh along the way.<br /><br />In some ways THE SON OF NEPTUNE has a middle-of-the-series syndrome. Parts of it felt like it was gearing us up for the final huge quest and battle. But it was still just as enjoyable as THE LOST HERO. The entire time I kept thinking about the final quest -- and finally bringing these characters together. The Roman life of Camp Jupiter is very interesting and gives a stark contrast to the Greek Camp Half-Blood, and it will be exciting to see the two ways of life clash as they struggle to work together in the next book.<br /><br />THE MARK OF ATHENA can't come quickly enough. The future has been foretold. Gaea -- the goddess of the earth -- waits for her final chance to strike and then rise to rule over everything. The Romans are on edge with Greeks coming their the way. Only time will tell if the demigods can join with their parents and fight against the overwhelming evil facing them. And only then will we know if Rome and the gods themselves will stand or fall.waits for her final chance to strike and then rise to rule over everything.

0307276902|2.0|I am glad that I did some research and found out all the controversy that surrounds this memoir BEFORE I read the book - otherwise I would have been deeply disappointed had I read it and then found out. I got on Oprah.com and watched the interview along with reading reviews. A memoir is a written statement of the author's depiction of what happened. James may very well have felt that this is the way it happened; that being said, I think his fabrication of certain events was made to look more dramatic than what truly transpired. It misleads readers. It should be more of a \\"based on a true story\\" novel rather than considered a memoir. It is not a true depiction of the recovery of an addict. These facts dampered the way I went into it when I started to read it.<br /><br />I am almost 60% of the way through it and, to be honest, I don't see me finishing it but we'll see. I hate doing that because it would be a waste of reading the first half of the book but I don't find myself wanting to sit down and read it. Those are the kind of books I love - the ones that you want to devour.<br /><br />His overuse of \\"and\\" is driving me crazy...<br />\\"I was hungry so I went to the dining hall AND grabbed a tray AND loaded up by plate AND sat down alone AND starting eating AND felt like I was going to get sick AND forced myself to keep eating AND looked around AND everyone was eating AND I wanted to be like them\\". This was a very annoying way of writing and I am just not a fan of his style.<br /><br />Point being, there are plenty of other TRUE and INSPIRING depictions of people who portray their recovery as it actually happened. I'm not a fan and I most likely won't be going any further in my collection with this author...
B004RLPWXS|5.0|What kind of freak of nature enables a pop rock band - consisting of guys in their early 50s - to put out its best album, 30 (THIRTY) years after its debut? Can you imagine the Beatles, the Stones, Led Zep putting out their best album in the late 1990s?<br /><br />Forget the guys' looks and videos - Duran Duran is comprised of extremely talented songsmiths, with a gift for melody, and truly remarkable musicians. Seeing them live last night, it's stunning to consider they could play a whole different set list, consisting of entirely different songs, but just as great and beloved by the world.<br /><br />But back to this album. It is so great because it unabashedly embraces the sound that Duran invented and made famous in the first place. And wonder producer Mark Ronson gets the credit for that. Why on Earth did Duran spend the 1990s trying to invent a new sound? Did they think they would top the original?<br /><br />Ronson promised fans the sequel to Rio, but honestly Ronson and the band outdid themselves and topped that album to create their best to date. Highlights: Girl Panic!, Blame the Machines, Safe, Too Bad You're So Beautiful, Other People's Lives, and Being Followed. Other greats included Leave a Light On, Before the Rain, and Man Who Stole a Leopard. Perhaps the weakest track is the title track, but that's great too, so it's really wall to wall songs, each of which could have been a top 10 hit in the 80s.<br /><br />Thank God for Mark Ronson, thank God for Duran Duran.

An excellent insight into the dichotomy between Asian and Western thinking that still exists today in close incarnations.

B004HWR406|4.0|I went to wikipedia after watching this movie because I was a bit curious as to what Zuckerberg was like before he got to Harvard. I think the addition of the material I found there would have put another layer of understanding for us in this movie.  It is very well written but I think the pre Harvard Zuckerberg needed to be included. This movie begins at Harvard and we never look back in time.<br /><br />What I discovered was that Zuckerberg was a child prodigy.  He was creating things from earliest childhood and since electronics were there in earliest childhood, he latched onto them.  He was blessed in having two educated parents who realized they had a prodigy so he was given all the support and education such a child needed. He was also the head of the fencing club at school and was excellent at fencing. (To put it mildly, this would have fit this movie's storyline perfectly.) He was also excellent at the classics and could recite the ILIAD and the ODYSSEY to anyone upon demand, among other things. Harvard took one look at his record and he was accepted.<br /><br />The movie tends to view him much more one dimensionally.  He is seen almost exclusively as a computer nerd and that he has a computer person's personality.  He is extremely unlikable from the very first frame of the movie.  His mannerisms are as off putting as possible.  This makes a lot of sense when you realize he was a child prodigy.  They have a long history of not adapting to social situations well and are notoriously bad with people.  So Zuckerberg's \\"problem\\" with having a miserable personality does not really stem from his being outstanding at high tech.  He was outstanding at everything.<br /><br />The movie greatly concerns his legal problems with other students at Harvard who claimed they were in on the making of Facebook and that Zuckerberg needed to compensate them for that.  But one thing is apparent from day one: on their own they did not have the ability to create anything complex from start to finish. Inventors do have to be able to go the distance with an idea, not just get an idea.<br /><br />So there is a lot of law in this movie and a lot of legal wrangling.  I could have used a lot less of that despite my being a lawyer.  I was much more interested in Zuckerberg's emerging from being a child prodigy into being the creator of Facebook than I was in anyone else's sort of working with the same idea and wanting to sue Zuckerberg.<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg does a wonderful job as Zuckerberg.

B003L77GH4|5.0|My wife is an avid follower of this series and let me know in a roundabout,big brown eyed way(as women do)she would like this,so logged on bought it,was here 2 days later,very happy wife means I am happy too,save $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ over retail,even at the store that begins with W,this is way less expensive,no queues to wait in and delivered to the door and savings too,how good is that.
B005LZZMRK|5.0|I felt that Wilson's first solo album, \\"Insurgentes,\\" was a bit of a \\"tough listen.\\" Too much noodling, too many Pink Floyd-isms, but the annoying ones, the snarly Roger Waters songs that aren't really songs but Waters snarling into the mic while the band noodles on behind him.  I like this entire album, but for me, there's a core 23 minutes that can only be described as \\"magnificent.\\"  1). Remainder The Black Dog, featuring Steve Hackett (9:27)  Starts off kind of slow, moody, trippy, and by the 3:30 mark, it's a guitar, bass & drum dogfight worthy of the King Crimson \\"Red\\" era. For my tastes, this is the album's high point.  2). No Part Of Me, featuring Trey Gunn & Pat Mastelotto (5:44)  Once again, things start off slow and tentatively (a Wilson trademark?)...and around the 3:30 mark (again !), things get louder and more intense. Then it's another King Crimson shock & awe landscape, leading to a sudden drop-off into a quiet resolution.  3). Deform To Form A Star, featuring Jordan Rudess & Tony Levin (7:51)  This is sort of like \\"Steely Dan meets the David Gilmour melodic Pink Floyd.\\"  Some of the keyboard figures are extremely reminiscent of Katy Lied / Royal Scam-era Dan...some of the guitar, too. Vocals are mildly Gilmour-ish. Some nice Beach Boys-style harmonies around the 6:30 mark.  Wilson is DEFINITELY on the move, DEFINITELY growing. This album is nothing like \\"Insurgentes.\\" Depending on how you felt about that one, it may be a good thing, or a bad thing, or simply just a different album. But it's a killer, make no mistake about it.
1439102813|5.0|My father has Alzheimer's disease. Reading this book written from the perspective of the person with the disease really makes you stop and think about how hard and frustrating it must be for them; particularly in the beginning when they are aware something is wrong.
B005HG4C4C|5.0|OK, we all know the story.  Drummer Mike Portnoy LEFT...then asked to come back...and the band said NO...and prog fans all over the world wondered if they could possibly carry on without him.  They can. They did. I agree with many of the reviews here...while the level of musical skills on any Dream Theater album rarely, if ever, comes into question, the album concept and/or the songs themselves can sometimes add up to a less-than-enjoyable experience. Lots of chops, just not a lot of memorable songs.  Not on THIS one, baby. It's got the chops AND the songs. It's classic Dream Theater, it SMOKES, and the centerpiece...the 12-minute is every bit as good as any epic they delivered during the peak years with Portnoy, and a rocket ride through everything this band does best.  Second favorite is \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" and the irresistible lyrical hook \\"You build me up, you break me down, until I'm falling to pieces...I crash and burn, I never learn, I'm your guilty addiction...\\"  But it's a great ALBUM. Yeah, there are standout tracks. But it will restore your faith in this band's ability to carry on, if you needed it.  Sometimes \\"new blood\\" in a band kills that band. Can you say \\"Van Halen III?\\"  But in Dream Theater's situation, talented and capable new blood Mike Mangini joins John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess, John Myung and James Labrie on the next leg of the band's journey. Best wishes, guys...many more albums, many more tours, we're all waiting.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|This is one of the most unbelievably great albums I have ever heard. The song selection is great, the vocals are superb, and the guitar playing is just awesome. If there one song that totally got to me, it was I'd Rather Go Blind. The combination of Beth Hart's voice and Joe's guitar just floored me. Somewhere Etta James is smiling!

B0058RN85O|5.0|Fantastic show, fantastic price! I love this show so much. Every week, Modern Family is what makes me laugh and feel great all week long. The characters, creativity, and mix of both slapstick and subtle humor is perfect! I hope this show never goes off the air.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Just got it and love it.  My son loves being turned 'into a cartoon.' I also like the ability to add the filters to existing photos.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I love this watch. It's great for running. My only complaint is that the bezel dial is a little bit hard to use and the user manual is not great, so there are a few things that you have to figure out by trial and error, but other than that, it's great. I have used it in a race and on a few runs and it hasn't let me down and has not lost satellite signal once. I also like the fact that it comes with a fabric strap as well as the plastic one. Very handy. It does have a big face, but not too big.  The data transfer is also easy to set up.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|While there aren't a vast amount of filters, what it does provide works and works well.  Unlike other photo effect apps, this app doesn't require your phone be a beast in terms of specs to run it. No lag or hiccups at all on my samsung vibrant.
B004529NLG|5.0|I am not into Dance movies and bought this only to enjoy 3D based on the reviews. It turned out to be the best in my collection and highly recommended if you are into 3D. The guys who made this know what they are doing and their maturity with this new technology is not seen any other live action 3D movie. The 3D titles at the end susms it all up with vibrant colors, best pop out and dept effects. A few times the 3D is so real that you feel as if you are on the dance floor and you duck as the dancers jump towards you. May time they poke their hands at you which is very realistic.
B0052N3ERQ|3.0|I was really hoping this was my holy grail.  I've moved beyond the HP48 in the real world.  Was hoping this would be the 49+ Series.  Certainly looked like the real deal.  Unfortunately, It kept nagging me that it was not the Paid Pro version (for certain it was).  I'll gladly purchase again, if the incorrect \\"Unpaid-App\\" message is taken care of.  Purchased mine from the Android Market, not Amazon.  I'll try the Amazon version now.  OK, Amazon's version did not have the bogus unpaid app warning.  BUT  This app \\"WILL NOT\\" Emulate the 49+.  I'm running this on the AT&T Galaxy S2
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Wow. It has only taken almost 20 years for Anthrax to return.  After trying to cash in on rap metal and comedy punk, they have returned to their thrash roots and made a great album full of thrash riffs, searing solo's and great vocals.  For some reason, John Bush never fit into Antrhax like Joey Bellodona.  This is a strong release, comparable to Metallica's Death Magnetic.  Both bands have gone through rough times and have come back to lay the smack down once again and prove that they are the best thrash metal bands in the world.  I had written both of them off over the years, but with these releases they do not disappoint.  Sometimes going back to your roots is the only way to find yourself.  They have finally gone back to being the band their core audience loved and given up on cashing in on fads and trends.  Great job guys.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|My enjoyment of the show built throughout the season. By the end of it I was hooked on the characters, then problems, and the mysteries.  The DVDs have great additions--interviews with cast and crew.  I hope it will be on for more than two seasons!
B004FN7ZOC|5.0|Amon Amarth have outdone themselves with their latest offering, \\"Surtur Rising\\".  Let me say that every song on this album is incredible.  There is no fluff, no pointless 3 minute intro's filled with chanting or any other gimmick used to put an extra track on an album.  I have been listening to this band since it's inception, and I can say that I am very impressed with their evolution over the years.  The songs have solid riffs, with amazing melodic background guitar, and blazing solo's.  This is melodic death metal done right.  I read one review expressing disappointment with the \\"cookie monster vocals\\".  This can't be further from the truth.  First of all, this is death metal, if you want clear vocals go to best buy and by some Prog metal like Hammerfall instead.  You can trade the so called cookie monster vocals for a guy that sounds like he got his balls run over by a steamroller instead.  The vocals are harsh, but they fit the music perfectly.  They add the brutality to the mix of melody, beauty, and pure shredding.  I like death metal, and love In Flames, Dark Tranquility, Insomnium etc.  I was disappointed with In Flames latest release, but I could not be more happy with Amon Amarth.  If you like this album, I recommend you check out Insomnium, Anterior, older In Flames and a band called Searing Meadow.  For those who like clean vocals, check out Amorphis.  They mix in clean and brutal vocals in a way that is not bombastic or cheesy.  This is definitely the best melodic death metal release of 2011.  From the first second to the last, there is nothing but perfection.
031603441X|2.0|I'm not a reader of memoirs or biographies, and I'm not a big Rolling Stones fan, so if it weren't for my book club, I would never ever have picked this up. And I think you need to be either a memoir or Stones fan in order to make this 550-page slog worth your while. The issue that always comes up for me when it comes to memoirs is: to what extent are you reacting to the book, and to what extent are you reacting to the life that is the subject of the book? To me, the two seem to be inextricably married and hard to separate.<br /><br />So, to the extent it's possible to separate them, I found the parts of the book where Richards focuses on the music fairly engaging and insightful. The book is especially strong in the first third, as he details how his family nurtured his interest in music,and how his love of American blues music brought him into contact with all these other people with a similar interest. His account of meeting Mick Jagger on a train station and ogling his record collection is great. And to a certain extent, his accounts of how songs were crafted is pretty interesting (although, I've been told these don't always align with what others present at the creation have recounted). However, I imagine that even these portions will be much more interesting to my friends who play instruments and are in bands than they are to me.<br /><br />As for the rest of it... well, it just struck me as a fairly typical rock star candid tell-all, replete with all the snide carping and self-mythologizing that comes with the territory. Not to mention, rife with contradictions: drugs never affected me (except when they did), I never pursued women (or rather, \\"bitches\\" as he charmingly calls them in much of the book), or kept tallies of my conquests (except when I proceed to name numbers of them), isn't Mick a jerk for moving in on his bandmate's women (unlike me, who stole Anita Pallenberg from Brian Jones), Mick's side project music in the '90s sucked (unlike my awesome band The X-Pensive Winos -- what do you mean you never heard of us?) and on and on and on in endless self-justifications. And that doesn't start to delve into his largely absentee parenting, including not coming back from tour when his infant son dies from SIDS, and then admitting he has no idea where (or whether) the baby was buried -- while making oblique references of blame toward Pallenberg. Race is a whole separate topic for consideration, as he twice appoints himself an honorary black person in describing his brotherhood with poor, southern black people, and later, Rastafarians. And his whole portrayal of himself as some kind of outlaw fighting against authority is pretty pathetic.<br /><br />So, don't get me wrong, I like the Stones just fine up until about 1970. Their music in the 1970s has some moments, and I can see why others like so much of it, it's just not for me. But what's somewhat ironic is that in the last 30 years, they've been able to build their corporate brand and infrastructure into a hugely profitable machine, while at the same time producing absolutely no noteworthy new music. Richards has been happy to ride that wave of fame and fortune, and more power to him I guess, but that doesn't make his life story worth spending several hours of one's life reading.nos -- what do you mean you never heard of us?) and on and on and on in endless self-justifications.

B005CM9DX6|1.0|I love Opeth, always have.  I can keep this review short by saying I have listened to it over and over waiting for it to grow on me and it has not.  I had high expectations for this album, and I realize this band is a very talented group of individuals who can play virtually any kind of music they want and do it well.  This album is proof that they can play prog jazz well.  Unfortunately I hate prog jazz.  For me, this album did not resonate.  The production is good, the instruments are played flawlessly and the vocals are top notch.  It just appears that this album was made to make an artistic statement instead of building on past accomplishments.  I realize many people like it, but for me, the bus left me at the station.  There is nothing wrong with evolving and experimenting, but when you travel so far out of your element that I cannot recognize you anymore, I must digress and say, to each his own.
B004SB60OC|5.0|Christina Perri is incredibly talented.  She has a strong, beautiful voice.  The cd is impressive.  I enjoy every song on it.  It is a must purchase!
B0050KEVO6|3.0|Downloaded this and it is very entertaining with lot's of facts. That said though it has very limited play as you will run into getting bogged down trying to figure out untried combinations and evetually you will run out of discoveries completely. I had on my Droid Bionic and on my Zoom. I would say screen size is a plus as there is a tendency if you decide to pull all the elements on the screen they will be hard to see on the small screen. Have also noticed one issue in that if you select a single element to add to the screen it drops based on where you pressed on it and sometimes can fall off the screen so you may need to use clear workspace.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|Steve Hackett is amazing.  The man has had a career resurgence in the 2000's that continues with \\"Beyond the Shrouded Horizon\\"  This 2 disc set contains a wide variety-vocal & instrumental pieces, rockers, acoustic numbers, atmospheric numbers...the fact that he is still writing & releasing new material on a regular basis that is high quality and for almost 40 years, while most of his contemporaries only rehash the old...it certainly vindicates his decision to leave Genesis.     His electric guitar soloing is also more aggressive and flashier (in a good sense) than ever and his music continues to explore new horizons.  He is the definition of a progressive rocker!   And the addition of Vocalist/guitarist Amanda Lehmann has brought about a quantum leap in the vocal harmonies the past 2 albums.  And Steve's lead vocals are stronger than they've ever been.   Standouts for me include the fiery opening track \\"Lock Lomond\\" (not the folk standard); the bluesy \\"Catwalk\\", with an impassioned lead vocal & amazing guitar work; the epic \\"Turn This Island Earth\\", the Middle Eastern vibe of the instrumental \\"Two Faces of Cairo\\".  And also a stronger version of an old favorite-\\"Reconditioned Nightmare\\"  Steve Hackett may have started with Genesis but he's turned into a Revelation.
0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson intercuts among multiple storylines to increase suspense and speed up the tempo. However, the book starts slowly as he set up the separate scenarios and characters. I would suggest to potential readers that the first half of the book requires substantial diligence to hack through the introduction of so many characters. This makes the story bitter sweet. The reader needs awhile to get grounded in the world of the story and in mind of the characters. For the patient reader, Larsson does an excellent job of setting up the storyline by giving the reader an anchor for each charter. When the charters are anchored, the story unfolds; previously independent scenarios and charters begin to converge towards a climax. If the reader can endure the early set-up, which is nearly half the book, the story really takes off and is fun to read. In the end, the endurance pays off and the characters are truly endearing. I can see why some reviewers wished the book would not end. However, I can also see where some reviewers found this book difficult to endure. I would recommend reading the book in large chunks. I think this is a book that if it is read in short burst, it is easy to lose track of the myriad of characters and back stories may suddenly becomes fragmented, then it would be easy to set down and not pick up again. However, if you can hang in there, the story really moves. Each of these chapters alternates between story lines. As the story approaches climax, the characters get shorter until all charters are involved in the same story line. Pretty cool.<br /><br />The story really had two protagonists that start off in completely separate story lines and converge into a climax of super-sleuthing. Mikael Blomkvist is a highly adaptive, modern man. Not only polite, but frequently profitable, without any commitments. He is sensitive to the needs of women. Best of all, he is profoundly sexually virile. Every time he turns around he got some girl throwing herself at him. His co-protagonist is the book's namesake. Everything Lisbeth Salander does is an act of defiance, a backlash against the unattainable standard of perfection. She is unkempt, disheveled with atrocious social skills. However, her special skill is computer hacking. Together, they find themselves on a mysterious Nordic island inhabited primarily by members of the dysfunctional Vanger family.<br /><br />The plot moves steadily forward, effectively maintaining suspense through the use of the multiple converging story lines. The characters are somewhat one-dimensional and even slightly clich&eacute;. Lisbeth is the brilliant hacker with Asperger's who can cut through computer algorithms and firewalls as easy as breathing. She is permanently changed from the violence, oppression, and desperation she experiences. On the other hand, Mikael is a modern James Bond, but he uses his pen instead of a gun. Although there were predictable elements, there were plenty of twists and turns to keep things interesting.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|Despite having only released two games (three with The Last Guardian due out in two months) since 1997, the Team ICO group has shown each time that they understand art and gaming.<br /><br />With the release of ICO during the Playstation 2's first year (2001) the team showed what could be done without having to focus solely on graphics. Understanding that they would have a difficult time working with a brand new machine that no one knew how to program well for, they created a game that utilized the shortcomings of the system to create an atmosphere that is still only rarely glimpsed (the original Silent Hill for the Playstation One also used the system limitations to create an effect greater than expected, if you haven't played it, it's on the PSN for $6 and can still can scare the &**^ out of you.)<br /><br />While using little music and low quality/detail textures, ICO is coupled with lovingly crafted sound effects and exquisite character animation highlighted by (what was then uncommon) HDR(High Dynamic Range) lighting along with a complete lack of any obvious tutorials, hints, or even any sort of timer or on screen display. It's just you, a horned boy, the pale girl that can't speak your language, and lots and lots of castle.<br /><br />But enough about how beautifully done the game is, you've surely read 83 other reviews that cover that. The game play....<br /><br />ICO has few controls that are easy to grasp and don't require any thinking about, once again, melding you into the game proper. Puzzles are completely based on logic or manipulating the environment. The whole point of the game, get the girl out of the castle and don't let anything happen to her.<br /><br />Little touches abound to help you:<br />Are you stuck and don't know what to do? Try watching Yorda and see what she's interested in. Is she standing on a box for no reason whatsover? It's probably not because the AI is stupid, try moving the box! Or perhaps she keeps tripping up while you drag her by the hand... Is it because she's looking around while you run? Try slowing down and let her go, see what she does.<br /><br />Example: The game doesn't tell you what a save point is. You come to the first one and Yorda points to it, sits down on it and pats the area next to her. Take a seat and the game asks if you want to save. Simple, elegant, and it didn't take the dismissal of 12 dialog boxes to tell you all about the save points and that you should save every change you get (I'm looking at you Final Fantasy.. ahem)<br /><br />Broken ladders give you a clue that maybe you should head up, of course the ladder is broken, but hey... you know where to go!<br /><br />There are enough save points at strategic locations to make this a game for the casual gamer - solve a puzzle, save and do another tomorrow - while later puzzles keep you scratching your head long enough to ensnare the hardcore RPG/ActionRPG crowd.<br /><br />All this, and that was just the game in 2001. Throw in a disc with the just as fantastic \\"prequel\\", plenty of bonus content, two dynamic XMB themes, widescreen and HD updates; and hey, 3d support that looks pretty dang good (better than Tron:Legacy, but we'll pretend that never happened); and you get a lot of bang for your $40.<br /><br />Buy it. And while you're at it, nab the book [[ASIN:1421540630 ICO: Castle in the Mist (Haikasoru)]] which for the first time has been translated into English. Amazon's got it for under $11 at the time of this review, so hey, get it while you have the free super saver shipping, right? I knew you would ;)ile you run?

0071752854|5.0|I read this book in one day.  Couldn't put it down.  It is engaging, fun to read and practical.  I found it viscerally satisfying and fulfilling.<br /><br />If you've been involved in copywriting, advertising, or selling, you're already familiar with the adage \\"first aim for the heart, then go for the mind\\" or \\"people buy for emotional reasons and then justify their purchase rationally\\". The interesting information bits that Oren shares from neuroscience about how the brain processes incoming information fit like beautiful pieces of a puzzle.<br /><br />Oren begins by pointing out how when we prepare pitches we are creating them in neocortex, whereas the listener is first processing the message through his reptilian or, as the Oren calls it, croc brain.  While neocortex processes complex information and is involved in problem solving, the croc brain deals with the basics of survival. It just wants to know whether what we are facing is good for us, or a threat to us - should we eat it or mate with it.<br /><br />Oren then delves into frames.  A frame is a perspective from which you look at the situation.  As you change the way you look at something, different solutions become possible and when you communicate with others, different frames enable you to engage people in different ways, from different positions. Oren explores power frames, time frames, analysis frames, intrigue frames, and morality frames.  You learn how to play with frames - how to create or bust them, how to deframe and reframe them, and how to collide and stack them.  The more skilled you become with flipping frames, the better you are able to create conditions that are conducive to obtaining your desired outcomes.  Near the end of the book, Oren gives suggestions for practicing frame games so that you can become a frame master.<br /><br />After you've set the stage with frames, Oren shares ideas on controlling different elements of the pitch - how to create and maintain the attention of your listeners, how to elicit just the right balance between desire and tension to hold one's attention; how to change your situational status, and how to construct your pitch - from the point of introducing yourself and the big idea, explaining the budget and the secret sauce, offering the deal, and then stacking frames for hot cognition.  He points out what to do to make it all easier on yourself and to get faster results.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Oren illustrates the points he is making with many instructive and entertaining stories.<br /><br />Oren uses the acronym STRONG to sum up his formula:  setting the frame; telling the story; revealing the intrigue, offering the prize, getting a decision.  As he guides you through each stages, he points out the most likely places where you may stumble or trip yourself, and tells you what to do to recover, so that you can create the perfect pitch.nce between desire and tension to hold one's attention; how to change your situational status, and how to construct your pitch - from the point of introducing yourself and the big idea, explaining the budget and the secret sauce, offering the deal, and then stacking frames for hot cognition.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I´m so excited with this box!!! Matrix rocks jeje waiting for a matrix 4 in the future wao... can you imagine that?
B000000ORE|5.0|Great Guitars & Voice ! A really nice follow up to the 1st. release \\" Mechanical Resonance \\" I love these guys ! Saw them live in 1988 & sounded spectacular !
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Works as advertised - and contrary to other premature posters, you can use the effects on pictures in your gallery. Please play with it and repost - that's only fair to the dev and users. As a teacher I see plenty of uses for this in my class room. Should be great fun outside of it too! Thank you dev and Amazon for the deal of the day!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Lg optimus v. Has fewer filters than some of the other camera apps but these ones end up looking the nicest. Great app for faotd.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This app worked better than I expected. I can't see a use for every filter, but the ones I like are pretty cool. The developer is also quick to respond. Can't wait for this to have a video recording feature!
0385344325|3.0|We never get to dislike the bad guy. We never really meet him. We see what he has done. But little empathy is created. We mourn the victims, but have no connection. Feels like homework. Plug in the formula. Describe all the little details. Run the mind clock. Ho hum. Losing speed and interest.
B000VWODZ0|5.0|The female vocalists on Promises and Walk out in the Rain are awesome!! For me they make the songs beautiful to listen to.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Fun filters that I haven't seen in other apps. Easy to pull in Gallery pictures to tweak them. Not sure I'd pay for it but I got it free as the App of the Day and I like it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun game. good graphics and can be challenging at times. Wouldn't mind if the new level updates came more often, but other than that, it's good.
030788743X|5.0|You don't have to be a gamer to love this book.  It takes place in 2044 and all the stuff we worry about: global warming, corrupt politics and lack of jobs have all come to pass.  The place is a mess!  It's a pretty dismal situation that the country is in, and the virtual world of OASIS is a great place to escape to.  With fancy visors and gloves that make virtual worlds easily accessible and much like reality, many people spend most of their time there.  Real life schools have become dangerous for teachers and students alike, so much of the school system is set up on OASIS so a teacher can teach from home and students can log in to their school rooms while actually being wherever their computer is located.<br /><br />It's not just school, jobs and shopping that are found in the worlds of OASIS, but chatrooms where you, represented by your avatar, make it feel like you're really there and you're able to touch things and look around and operate devices within the \\"room\\".  Did I mention there are also a whole slew of games on OASIS?  The one in this story is a game created by the founder and one of the creators of the OASIS, James Halliday,  who has just died and has stipulated in his will that his vast fortune be given to the first person who can find an \\"Easter egg\\" hidden somewhere in the OASIS.  Wade Watts, our story's main player is on a search with his virtual friends to uncover this Easter Egg and win Halliday's vast fortune.  I don't want to give away any spoilers because Cline has done such an amazing job of putting you right into this virtual reality world of OASIS along with Wade, that you'll have a hard time putting this book down until you've turned the last page.<br /><br />If you love the idea of virtual worlds and new technology and if you remember the culture of the 80's of which James Halliday was a big fan and incorporated all kinds of movies, games, music and trivia into his challenge, I think you'll probably enjoy this book as much as I did.  It's one of my favorite books this year.one of my favorite books this year.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|this app is a very original one. u can turn any photo on ur device into a drawn picture and take them through the app. comic boom is my favorite! droid bionic
0385341008|5.0|My grandma loaned me this book to read and from her description I could only nod, smile politely and take it home with me. I finally picked it up to read when I had finished the other books in my \\"queue\\". Needless to say, the letter format of the book (which she had forewarned me about) still took me aback. No introductions, no back story, it just launched right into the middle of Juliet's correspondence. Truthfully, I almost stopped reading. Indeed I did put the book down for about two weeks (maybe three) and sighed when I picked it back up from boredom. I had nothing else new to read at the time!<br /><br />Upon resuming my reading (about page 23) by the time I got to page 42 I was decidedly hooked. Since then I have enjoyed it immensely and will even go back to re-read it since my poor attitude about it in the beginning caused me to not enjoy those first 22 pages! I have had bad books recommended to me in the past, but this is happily yet another time where I had to eat some crow. I find post-war England of particular interest as well as the quirky villager-types demonstrated in this novel. The Channel Islands were heretofore almost a complete unknown in my previous perusals on the subject.<br /><br />This book doesn't need yet another \\"glowing review\\", but I thought I would add my two cents anyway.
B005CMSDKA|1.0|Disapointed flick that lacks theme and development. The disjointed story never goes anywhere. I do not wish to summarize it because it is not possible. Rent it, do not buy it.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This app does a good job of taking pics that look like sketches. It is on the dark side. Hopefully an update will fix that. The app is super fast and can also preview and save existing pics from the gallery.

0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins's riveting novel The Hunger Games follows the trials of a girl named Katniss Everdeen as she battles for her life in a twisted contest that requires her to kill others to save herself. Set in a fictional nation called Panem, the story revolves around a yearly contest run by \\"The Capitol,\\" the only place in the country where the people do not live in poverty and despair. Every year in order to show the twelve districts its power over their lives, The Capitol holds an event called the \\"Hunger Games\\" which pits two young people from each district in a brutal fight to the death. The contest is televised, serving the purpose of providing amusement for the people of The Capitol and a reminder of their powerlessness to the people of the districts. Katniss is chosen from District 12 and proves herself a formidable opponent in the Hunger Games. The climax comes when she figures out a way to outsmart the Capitol, putting her life in even more serious jeopardy and setting up a perfect situation for the sequel. Collins's writing is crisp and the way she paces the novel keeps you turning the pages until the end. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys action and adventure, as well as strong characters who stand up against injustice!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is cool and clever.  I downloaded it thinking it would be fun for my kid to play with, but now I'm thinking I won't be giving up my phone anytime soon.  Grab it while it's free!  Thanks developer!
B000002MX7|4.0|Good collection of Chaka Khan hits, but be aware that \\"Tell Me Something Good\\" is a live version.  I would have preferred the album version of that song, but, aside from that, this CD contains all the other songs I was looking for.
B004UA8D1O|4.0|The 3d effects were really cool and the movie was good, but not great as you would expect from James Cameron but as it turns out he was the producer not the director. I would say yes this is a buy rating
B000JLPMPS|1.0|Unique.  But a bar stool cowboy story that gets hopeless and stupid as the minutes pass.  The plot is for the type whose lives haven't been what they expected and they take it out on others.  Any fiction will do as an excuse.  The plot is full of justice or so it appears.  A collection of liars making up reasons to be cruel.    A bit of comedy.  Acting ok.  Camera work good.  But the plot is terrible in my opinion.  A design to make money and it worked.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|works great, not sure why people are saying you can not doctor up your photo gallery pi s. I have had no problems with pics I just took or the ones already in my gallery. Works better then I had hoped.
B004VMX5TQ|3.0|I am a little disappointed by this edition, the sound is generally improved compared to the previous edition of the 90, but the impression is that Capitol didn't use the original masters, they simply tried to improve what had already been prepared for the previous edition:   - Let It Rock has been shortened even   - The sound at the end of old time rock n roll has some imperfections, as if the tape used was ruined   Definitely better than the previous edition, but it is still an issue in low budget, we look forward to a final deluxe edition with bonus tracks and expanded booklet
0330460552|5.0|GREAT BOOK - AM GRATEFUL THAT I COULD ORDER IT ON AMAZON.COM.  KEN FOLLETT IS ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITE AUTHORS.  AMAZON GAVE ME A GOOD PRICE AND THAT IS WHY I ORDERED IT FROM AMAZON.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|When I take a picture it closes and opens another totally unrelated app on my phone. So weird! Takes really cool pics though. I have a Motorola Atrix.
B004A8ZWWE|4.0|...in good ways and a few bad. First of all let me say, and my rating should suggest, that I recommend this film. I enjoyed it as a fun popcorn movie. Will I buy it? Probably not; but I would watch it again for sure. This film is pure escapsim but in a much more endearing way than most cgi robot films. This is Rocky meets Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, an odd combination but one that works overall.  Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lilly really make this story work on a much higher level than it should. There is some unrealistic and forced dialogue that is delivered well enough and sincerely enough to keep it from being distracting. The child actor does a decent job and though he isn't always quite natural I can't fault him and he has the personality needed for the role (perhaps his look just reminds me too much of the awful kid who played Anakin Skywalker in Phantom Menace, but this child is far more spirited and likable). The rest of the casting is fun, if not a little stiff, but the film moves along at a pace where you just enjoy the ride and characters serve their purpose.  The real stars of the film are Hugh, Evangeline and the young kid (Dakota Goyo) and they keep you involved. Then there is the Real selling point who might also be considered a star, the robot, Atom. He is well designed and even a likable character despite not having a single line of dialogue. I kept expecting them to go in the direction of the robot having an artificial intelligence but thankfully things are left more light and ambiguous.   Other positives, the CG is great overall, the cinematograhpy is well done and doesn't make you sick or lose track of the fights. The fight arenas are each different and each of the fights, which can feel repititive in a film like this, feels fresh and distinct in enough ways to stand as unique.  The story has some points that don't play as naturally as they could, expository lines and forced scenes, but ultimately all is forgiven in the final showdown when the finalblows are thrown as they are (both literally and metaphorically). If the climax of the film doesn't make you cheer it at least makes you feel good and returns you for a brief moment to a level of nostalgic childhood excitement.  We all know where the film is going, but it is fun getting there. And we've never seen it done with robots before, so why not? Go out see this film and have some fun, its a good film for the preteen/young adolescent crowd or for families (despite some colorful dialogue from both father and son). This films ending really, ahem, packs a punch...
3836503050|5.0|I recommend this book to all fans of Gil Elvgren and his art.  I like it very much  I was looking for this book for some time  Excellent!!!
B005HGZV6U|2.0|First of all, nothing wrong with the film itself - it's quite enjoyable for me.    That said, what were they thinking, putting out such low quality video on a bluray?  I was in SHOCK to find the video not fitting my wide-screen.  With 480p looking video quality, I thought I was looking at a DVD.  Are they gonna say that they used up all the space on audio, because this is clearly a waste of bluray space.  My Mazinkaiser SKL DVD looks much better than this and that came out only few months ago!  And bonus feature makes no sense - no descriptive captions attached and very lacking in terms of feature.  There is no way they can justify their above $30 price tag.  I might formally complain to EMI.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|The effects are great. On my DroidX, after I take a picture the application starts another application called  Medscape. I dont want this application but it seems to be forcing me to sign up. I click the back button and it takes me back to the Paper Camera application. The Paper Camera application is no longer working. The camera view window is black. I have to kill the Paper Camera app with a Task Killer then reload the Paper Camera application to make it work again. However, take a picture you are taken to Medscape again and repeat the whole process again. I will probably delete the application if it continues to try and force me to sign up for this Medscape \\"thing\\". It is too much a hassle to kill the app and restart it each time I take a picture.<br /><br />Edit: I deleted Medscape from my phone because I never used it. If I take a picture, stop the PC then restart it the camera view is black. I can only get operation back after I kill the application with task killer and restart it, but same thing after stopping and restarting the app. :(
B002ZG975Q|3.0|Rich, popular high school student Kyle Kingston (Alex Pettyfer) has it all.  Which means, since he's the star of a teen Hollywood movie, he's about to lose it all and learn some Life Lessons in the process.  When his arrogance attracts the attention of a witchy-looking girl (Mary-Kate Olsen, he finds himself becoming well - beastly.  Well, sort of.  The Kyle in the eponymous book fares much worse - literally turning into a beast.  With fur that grows back within minutes. Movie Kyle just loses his hair and acquires some freaky tattoos.  Horrified at the change in his son, Kyle's mean, shallow dad (Peter Krause) sequesters him in a fancy apartment and hires Neil Patrick Harris as a live-in tutor.  He has only a year in which to find a girl who truly loves him for who he is - which means becoming less self-centered - otherwise the curse is permanent.    Pettyfer, who is also a model, looks the part of a spoiled brat, but he seems half-hearted about acting nasty.  He's much better during the rest of the movie which requires him to look wounded, angry and vulnerable.  I actually found the tattoos kind of sexy.  Since his character still resembles an actual human being, the whole necessity of having him stay away from other people and not be permitted to attend school was missing.  Especially, in the city - who would really give him more than a second glance?  There was absolutely no danger or drama that he might be recognized skulking around with a hoodie.     Fans of the book should know that quite a bit is changed - including character names.  The ending is changed, too - we never find out what happens when Kyle's dad sees his transformed son.  Frankly, I thought keeping it would send a stronger message about what family really is and be a happier ending, but then who watches movies for the message?
B001MIVTVS|5.0|I remember the days when Donavan was called The Evening Star. This album has so many of the songs I loved then and still  Do now.

I really LOVE this album. so if Donavan is your type of song , I think you'll agree.

B0057GYOA4|3.0|The good old loudness war. After getting Thin Lizzy's classic Chinatown Deluxe Edition, I noticed something. It wasn't mixed to maximum loudness. Yipee! Nirvana's Nevermind however was not so fortunate. To your average kid who solely listens to illegally downloaded MP3's on his ipod, this might sound fine, but not to me. It's just too loud. The music has no pop, nothing jumping at you. Very limited dynamic range. You can see for yourself in the customer images I have posted. Think of it as going to the movies and everything is the same volume. The explosions, the gunfights, etc at the same volume of say, a person speaking. Now that just doesn't make sense now does it? There's no oomph, no pop, nothing to make you jump out of your seat, and that's just what this deluxe edition accomplishes. The extras are actually pretty decent, and the packaging is nice apart from Universal cutting corners and replacing the hard outer plastic box with the DELUXE EDITION logo on it with a band that  wraps around the digipack that you have to cut through to get to the goods, or you just get a plain little stick on it that reads DELUXE EDITION. It looks cool and all, but it doesn't cut it. I strongly suggest sticking to your original CD and come across the extras on your own.

B001CDLAT4|5.0|I have seen so many fantastic films, but Baraka is on another level for me.  I have watched it over 100 times and I still love it, because the film changes along with each viewer's personal evolution.  It is not about knowing what happens, it is about knowing how we react to what is happening.  I know that Ron Fricke has just released the sequel to this outstanding film, and I really cannot wait to see it.  Unfortunately, I live in Peru and so I might have to wait for it to come out on DVD.  In the meantime, I'll just continue to enjoy the amazing cinematography and content of Baraka, my favorite film of all time.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|This CD is a MUST have for any Beatles fan! It is clean, crisp, and far more spupperior than most remixes of this Album I have heard. Also, there was a copy of the Beatles \\"LOVE\\"CD with this CD. Not sure if it originally shipped that way, but it was a very pleasent surprise. Having never listened to \\"LOVE\\" I found it to be an ecclectic mix of some of the finest Beatles' songs ever written. Some wierdness on it, but George Martin and his sone were definetly experimenting, as if the days when they originally were mixing Pepper were back. I will be enjoying this for a long time!
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|What an easy, fun read. This is what a romance novel should be like when the subject is dragons and \\"others.\\". Great uber-alpha lead and strong female heroine. Action and romance with interesting ancillary characters. A perfectly good novel in this genre. Four and a half stars.

0071762345|5.0|This is a great book on Social Media.  it is a blend of how it works, how to approach it and what you should know as a user.  It is good for basic and intermediate Social Media gurus.  Dave Kerpen is definitely an industry pundit!

B004ZN9R6G|4.0|Created as the soundtrack for a film \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" holds up remarkably well independent of the film it was created for (and it has held up better than the film).<br /><br />Made up of four instrumentals and six songs the album demonstrates that Pink was ready for their big break through follow up album.<br /><br />There aren't any bonus tracks. It would have been nice to have some outtakes and/or demos since fans are in most cases purchasing this set again.<br /><br />The remaster sounds surprisingly good. I say surprisingly because some of the remasters sound better than others. James Gutherie's remaster captures a bit more bottom end than the 1995 remaster. The packaging redesign is nice but it would have been nice to have a sleeve to store the CD in rather than riskit vbeing scratched up by the cardboard (which isn't quite as sturdy as The Beatles remaster packaging but better than the Apple releases which tended to use very flimsy cardboard by comparison).<br /><br />This is a nice sounding remaster that, in some areas, improves on the original master and the 1995 remasters. OBC holds up remarkably well  in fact it holds up better than the movie) for a \\"soundtrack\\". Recommended.

I just find it so much easier to just push a couple of buttons and see my boys then it is to go through the trouble of putting in all the discs of 1 season.;-) So to some up in one word how I feel about this AMAZING show. \\"ADDICTION\\"!
B005CM9DX6|4.0|I have to start by saying (as many) that I have loved Opeth from the beginning! I love death metal but also love 60s 70s music, and progressive music is one of my favorites! While this is trying to be progressive I can't help but think that Ghost Reveries and Watershed did a much better job with the progressive side of things. I hate saying anything bad about this band I really do! Opeth have been one of the only bands along with Porcupine Tree that I can't wait to get my hands on the next GREAT album, but with Heritage I think in my opinion, they missed the mark somewhat....As I stated I do really love progressive and have no problems with the mellow side of progressive but most progressive...look at ELP, Yes, King Crimson, Gentle Giant etc etc....They are not really mellow bands, they are to me very heavy in their own way and truly amazing. This album seems to have a few ok moments but as soon as something interesting happens the groove has changed and the moment is gone. These strong moments on the album just don't stick around long enough to get into and then were back to the constant meandering slow nonsense throughout this album that seems to bring up no feelings whatsoever....What were they thinking? I hate to say this as well but there are a million progressive bands new and old that are FAR better than this which is a shame because in my eyes nothing ever touched the Opeth realm of musicianship these days! Opeth have always blown me away! I always LOVED to LOVE them but with this album it just seems lackluster and it goes nowhere...Granted I do like moments on here quite a bit but as a whole (and I have listened to it over and over) it just doesn't seem as strong as any of the past albums or any progressive album I know, it just seems mediocre? WHY? I know the band must love it but I'm not sure what they are loving? There are no exciting parts at all????? Just a lot of meandering slowness??? And the slowness would be fine if it was balanced with something else that brings you through different realms, that's what is amazing about progressive music. I for one would LOVE an amazing progressive album from Opeth but I don't think this is the one....Lots of people are saying how great and progressive this is but I don't seem to be able to see it compared to the incredible power in progressive bands. This seems to be missing any moments of power or grandness or epic tracks. I still LOVE the band and always will but I just wish this album was stronger!

B005FLX2WC|5.0|Several people have said that they were big fans of Joe Bonamassa but had never heard of Beth Hart until this CD.  I'm the opposite.  I've been a big fan of Beth Hart for 10 years but had never heard of Joe Bonamassa.  He's obviously a very talented guitar player, but Beth makes this CD.  I just hope that someday she will be discovered by the world and get her due.  For those that just met Beth, buy some of her CDs and meet the best female blues singer I've ever hear (with a few rock/roll songs thrown in).
B005JU5JEI|1.0|SO, I have seen plenty of movies and even the worst ones have some redeeming values...but not this one!  This is above and beyond the WORST movie I have ever seen!  Surprising too, because based on the cast, I was expecting this movie to be a lot better.  The story is terribly written, really trashy and the acting is not much better.  To be honest, I am not a prude(I mean Caddyshack is my fav movie of all time), but to me, this movie was vulgar in a way that was not even funny.    The only actors who made this movie watchable were Jason Segel and Lucy Punch who actually delivered some funny lines.  I was so happy once this movie was over, that I did not have to watch one more second of it.  If you like comedy and good movies, you're gonna be sorely disappointed by this stinker!
B0055V6EZE|3.0|I like Hugh Laurie, and this CD is nice. Not great, but nice. A little sleepy, but I suppose that's what it was meant to be.
0345455681|4.0|This is a fine book for those who like a novel based on historical events.  The author holds true to the history of London while creating a timeline of other world events allowing the reader to gain a broader view of other world areas over a very long period of time.    The book was shipped in a timely manner and is in good condition.  I am very pleased with this purchase.
0743201140|5.0|Great book. Shared a lot of helpful insights. It is a little broad, but in a way that is good. It leaves it up to the reader to apply it to their lives. Not for the person who wants this to be similary to the ASVAB test. It won't tell you which career suits you best. It WILL tell you what your strengths are within its profile (great results!) and then give you wisdom in how to manage and build on them. Then you can apply that self-awareness to whatever job you are in. Great tool.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Got the free version of this game because everyone is raving about it. Can't figure out what the rave is about.  OK, but...
1439297517|5.0|I read this book about 65 years ago and I wanted my granddaughtes to read it. I was so  excited  that you had this book in stock, along with the other two. My granddagthers will love it. The Books  came on time and in  good shape. Thank you, very much.  Bonnie Cadwell

B005J0VPNC|5.0|I remember seeing this app a long time ago but it wasn't free. so when I saw this app was free I instantly got it, and its as awesome as I believed it would be! very stable app and the pictures live up to its promise. one of the best free app of the day!
B003ELOQCA|5.0|I had the pleasure to see this show Live in Los Angeles 2011. This DVD is an incredible example of how great a live concert DVD can be. The huge size and scale are well depicted while we as the audience are drawn into an intimate performance by U2. This is a concert DVD for anyone who enjoys incredible production design, energy, color, movement and great sound. If you are a U2 Fan, you simply can't do without it. The staging is among the most technologically advanced ever devised and it's transformations are beautifully executed. One will never be disappointed by this DVD. I was a mild fan. This DVD put me over the top. I'm a fan now. Well done, boys!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Fun little app. The people who say that you cannot apply the filter to photos in your gallery are wrong. It is quite easy to apply to any picture you have in your phone. Not sure why they are unable to figure it out.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|love uno,  this app has lots of gameplay options,  which is a plus.  however,  like others have said,  i wish the graphics were better.  I got it for $0.99 so if say it's worth $0.99,  but definitely not their regular asking price of $2.99.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This is such a good show.  If you haven't watched it, you really need to.  Even the slightly 'slower' storylines are interesting enough to keep me looking forward to the following week's new episode and keep me thinking about it all week, hoping it will come sooner.  Highly recommend this show, and if you haven't seen it and are starting new, you need to start with season 1 and watch at least the first 3 episodes before you judge.  When I watched Season 1 Episode 1, I was thinking, WHAT are my friends and family recommending but I kept going and I soon thought it was brilliant.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I've had my eye on this app for a week now. and I'm happy to get it for free! if find this app to work best when theres  a considerable amount of background scenery behind people. but thats just me. great app, well worth the ordinal price. Droid X2 here
0385512058|5.0|In Never Eat Alone, Keith Ferrazzi lays out uber helpful networking tips that, if put into practice, will improve both your personal and professional relationships.  The core mindset that Ferrazzi proposes in this book is an \\"other-centered\\" perspective of networking instead of a \\"me-centered\\" perspective of networking. This takes shape in some his core principles like helping other people succeed, not keeping score (example: who owes who a dinner), doing your homework on people that you want to meet, and throwing dinner parties for people.  Yes, he does name drop a lot. Yes, he does talk about his accomplishments a lot. Yes, he did graduate from an Ivy league school and this probably helped him in his career.   But, instead of being jealous of him or critical of his character, learn from the tips Ferrazzi puts forth in this book that are about giving instead of getting, following up with other people so they don't have to worry about following up with you, and building relationships that benefit all parties involved because life is one big web of interdependence.  A lot of Ferrazzi's ideas really are common sense. But the reason he has \\"5,000 people he can call right now and they'd pick up the phone\\" is that he followed through with these common sense tips.  You and I can do the same.  Ignore the naysayers, reading Never Eat Alone is well worth your time IF you put into practice.
0596009208|4.0|Head first Java is great book, no one can say it isn't. But STILL it is not book for total beginners. If you don't have experience i Recommend book: The Art and Science of Java by Eric Roberts (you can buy it here on Amazon). After that book you can easily take this book, Bruce Eckel's book Thinking in Java or something else.<br /><br />If you ask me about book, it is great, funny, you can read it fast, do ALL examples in book, even if u need to rewrite them... to sum up, you can learn a lot of things in this book, but at least some exp. is required!<br /><br />Keep reading ;)

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|There are not many books which are able to captivate me through the entire course of the novel, but this one did just that. I truly enjoyed the mysterious new world she created.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Easy to learn, fun to play, good time waster. The controls are easy, and the challenge comes with trying to do the level with the minimum moves possible.
0307387178|5.0|Like most people, I knew the story before I read it. It's hard not to hear when every media outlet in the world reports on it.  Still, the writing was spectacular. The story was gripping and horribly sad. And I thought about this book and this man for ages after reading the book. That continued thought is the primary sign for me that a book is great.  I'm sure the will be one of the books I re-read, despite doing this less often as I age because I have so many books I want to read for the first time before I die!
159514188X|4.0|I thought it was interesting.  Very quick read.  More appropriate for teens but I enjoyed it none the less.  Very eye opening to the difficulties of teenage years!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I don't do too many reviews, but saw this app was the free app of the day today and thought it may help someone on the fence.    I purchased this app about a month or so ago, and anytime I want to turn a scene into an artsy piece, this is the first and imo best app for the job. I've tried a couple others, and while they weren't bad, this one wins for ease of use with convenient adjustable scales.   I wish I had gotten it for free, but it was definitely worth the couple bucks when I got it. I used it to snap some pics of my gf's dog, and now it's her background for every tech device: ipad, laptop and desktop. lol, it got some Brownie points  :-P   This is a great app!
B005J0VPNC|1.0|This app is apparently not compatible with the HTC Hero. Every time I try to open it, it force closes. Looks like it would have been a cool app though.
B00386EZJU|5.0|This is wonderful instrumental music.  It is exciting, not boring.  Our young kids love to listen to it.  Many of the songs have a Celtic sound to them.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Awesome application, very fast and powerful! This is the best free app for the day ever, great program!!! worth the money even if not free!!!
B005J0VPNC|4.0|would be a five star but I can't use the led flash with the app. either that or I can't find it.  either of which make it loose a star.
B0041T7FS6|4.0|When it was first announced that the Chic team (Nile Rodgers, Bernard Edwards) would be producing the next Diana Ross album, her fans were excited about the possibilities of yet another great dance record from an artist that excelled in that genre with songs like \\"Love Hangover\\" and \\"The Boss\\". After the emotional triumph that was \\"The Boss\\", hopes ran high for an album that showcased her new found vocal power and mastering of the dance floor.   I  had personally liked \\"Chic Cheer\\", \\"Le Freak\\" and \\"I Want Your Love\\". I had purchased \\"Everybody Dance, Dance, Dance\\" but it really took the next album to peak my interest.   Upon initial listenings to \\"Chic diana\\" as I have chosen to call it, I was left cold without any emotional resonance. But then a strange thing happened. The record took on a life of its own, seemingly not dependent on fans to drive its sales. In one week, \\"Upside Down\\" jumped from *49 - *10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Diana fans were left puzzled but relieved. Soon the album, \\"diana\\" would spend an astounding 17 weeks atop the R&B album chart, #2 on the Billboard Top 200 for a long stretch and \\"Upside Down/I'm Coming Out\\" quickly became dance staples across the globe. The album went on to sell over 10 million copies internationally winning Diana a more youthful audience and the biggest hit in the black community possibly since the soundtrack to \\"Lady Sings the Blues\\" almost a decade earlier.  It was until Motown released the \\"diana: Deluxe Edition\\" that featured the much rumored Chic mixes. Legend had it that when Diana first heard the completed album from Nile and Bernard, she could not hear hits on the caliber of the work they did with \\"Le Freak\\" and \\"Good Times\\". Though she wanted a less serious album than the emotion-filled, \\"The Boss\\", she felt it sounded too much like a Chic album and not a Diana Ross album. Diana decided to remix the album  with Russ Terrana. The mixes were so radical that the controversy continued and at one point, Nile and Bernard had wanted to disassociate themselves with its commercial release.  Well with \\"Upside Down\\", \\"I'm Coming Out\\", \\"My Old Piano\\" and \\"Tenderness\\" becoming global hits, Diana appeared to be right in transforming the final mix.   However, upon listening to the Chic mixes on the \\"diana: Deluxe Edition\\", I have come to strongly favor their mix of \\"Upside Down\\" with the elongated ending, the full length brilliant \\"Tenderness\\" and the jagged ride that was to be \\"Have Fun (Again)\\" where she seems to reach for a note, slip on one step and then regain her footing all in one sentence.   So for those who failed to pick up the \\"diana: Deluxe Edition\\", included here are two tracks from the original mixes for you to judge on your own.
1423140591|5.0|This book is really awesome. Cant wait for the third one. I read all the Percy Jackson book, the lost hero, the 2 kane chronicles book and this is by far Rick Riordan worse!
B005974CDU|5.0|Mike Portnoy was the backbone behind Dream Theater since its inception.  When I read last fall that he had left the band I couldn't believe the headline.  It seemed even more unbelievable that the band chose to continue.  MP was always there maintaining the integrity of the band and (as all DT members) giving the fans 100% both musically and of himself.  That said, it is with no disrespect to MP when I say ADToE is the best DT album ever.  The band seems much more balanced.  Jordan Rudess is FINALLY getting his time in the spotlight to showcase the fact that he is one of the best keyboard players of all time.  The other members also live up to the high DT standards that fans have come to expect.  And hats off to Mike Mangini.  The band has lost NOTHING with the new man behind the kit.  MM has proven more than worthy of filling such big shoes, and is worthy of respect from all DT fans.  The one thing that really grabs me about this album is...as great a drummer as MP is, he is an equally bad (in fact, downright annoying) vocalist.  His barks, grunts, and groans disguised as  vocals are not missed.  Leave the singing to one of the best in the business in James LaBrie.  This album has made me think that maybe there was too much MP on prior albums.  It's nice to have a virtuoso drummer that just plays drums.  I only hope this is the first of many albums from this lineup.
0439680093|1.0|I am very disappointed that this is considered a Young adult book.  My children discovered this book in their Elementary library. I have read a few Alex Rider Books because my children were interested in reading them.  As I read the Alex Rider series, I felt the issues were too mature for children.  I felt they were extremely disturbing based on the violent themes and imagery.  I found my 9 year old son reading Raven's Gate and decided I needed to review it before he was allowed to read it. He only made it through 2 chapters before I got a hold of the book. How grateful I am that I decided to start reading this book.  The book starts off glorifying crime and giving into peer pressure related to stealing. It appears to be OK to steal if you want something or need money.   But that was only the beginning.  This book dealt a great deal with witchcraft and Satanic worship.  I often had a very sick feeling when bad things were going to happen. I found it disturbing how it described someone waking up after being tranquilized and how it felt to be unable to move or cry out. Not to mention a pool of blood & horrific circumstances.    The main character, a teenager, is given to a \\"woman\\" who is more like a demon than a woman, full of power so strong she can convince people to kill themselves or scare you so bad you wished you were dead.  This book is about witches and witchcraft, devil worship and demons.  DO NOT ALLOW YOUR CHILDREN TO READ IT.  I strongly suggest this book be removed from children's reading and be categorized under horror and demon worship.  I will Never allow another one of my 5 children to read an Anthony Horowitz book again. I am disgusted and sickened by his writing style and desire to introduce children to such disturbing imagery.
B000002OZY|5.0|I just finished listening to this album and I'm once again reminded of the why it's such an absolute classic offering that changed the whole landscape of music.  Pete Townshends vision of a \\"Deaf, Dumb and Blind\\" kid made music history and catapulted The Who into truly legendary status of mythic porportions.  This is more than the first Rock Opera, it's more than a classic rock and roll album.<br /><br />It's something that had not been conceived let alone accomplished before.  It is truly a concept album in the truest since of the word and one were Pete Townshend seperates himself from his british songwriting contemporaries as the head of the class.  It also was a showcase for the songwriting of his bandmate, \\"The Ox\\", John Entwistle.  His contributions on the album are some of it's most haunting.<br /><br />This album is truly captivating, epic, haunting and powerful in it's presentation. It deals with several topics in depth and truly explores the highs and lows of the human experience and delves into the depravity of mankind like few other records have.  But it accomplishes this in such a subtle way that you almost miss the message that Townshend is attempting to get across.<br /><br />The songwriting is incredible and the musicianship is outstanding, it's hard to believe that these 4 men could generate such raw power.  The Who were never really like any of the other british invasion acts, but this one set them truly apart in a profound way.<br /><br />No other band at that time had come up with anything like this and this truly is the album that pushed the boundaries of what people thought could be done with a record.  The Who sometimes seems to be somewhat in the \\"shadow\\" of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones when one discusses the greatest bands from the UK, not after this masterpiece.  The others were now playing catch up and neither ever produced anything quite like this.<br /><br />The Who are the greatest band from across the pond in my opinion and the previous album, \\"Who Sell Out\\", would start a string of albums that the music world had not yet truly experienced.  The concepts and anthems Pete Townshend with assists from John Entwistle, were able to come up with and the band able to relate and perform were truly astonishing.  This album would allow them to shine in ways few ever have.evious album, \\"Who Sell Out\\", would start a string of albums that the music world had not yet truly experienced.

B004SIP8W0|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie.  This father shows how a father and a family can create a loving, fun atmosphere for children even in the most dire and difficult of times.  The love he shows for his son, and the love he shows for his wife are so inspirational. Yes, it seems unrealistic to us in parts...but it is the story of love and hope and survival. What the people endured in the concentration camps will always seem unrealistic to us. It is beyond our imaginations. But, it happened. It is real.  I never get tired of seeing this movie. It is now out in English and the English version is excellent because it uses their real voices. Be sure to see this movie! Don't listen to the nay sayers and the put down artists. You will miss a magical story! You will laugh, and laugh and laugh...and cry.

1401207529|2.0|This book is consistently the number 1 rated/ranked Batman graphic novel of all time. However, I picked it up in September 2011. When you have been to so many other modern Batman interpretations, this book loses it's shine big time! However, I can see that within the context and period it was originally published (1980s I believe) it is groundbreaking.  The problem is the modern interpretations of Batman and Catwoman are my favourites. The work of Jeff Loeb in Hush, The Long Halloween and Dark Victory; as well as Chris Nolan's The Dark Knight - has elevated Batman to a new profound level of a symbol of justice and dark altruism; with a deeply complex psychology behind Batman and his supporting characters.  This book, in today's context, is weak and a bit dull frankly. It heavily influenced a scene in Batman Begins, and unfortunately, there isn't much else to the book outside this scene (now embodied in film) that is interesting or unique. Catwoman makes an appearance, and is a far departure from the Selena we know of the 2010s - and frankly wasn't an interesting character at all. The artwork is definitely not my cup o' joe either. Going for the realistic feel very far removed from the superhero style.  So my point is that new readers should not hype themselves up. It is a historically important story, that built the foundation for today's excellence; but itself, does not achieve greatness.

B005974C94|2.0|I'm a huge fan of both Marsalis and Clapton but cannot recommend this CD for it's music. While the musicianship itself is excellent, the music is not enjoyable unless you are a fan of hard-core dixieland jazz. I am seriously disappointed in this recording.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|Ok, now I am P***ED!!! First the update for Angry Birds Seasons ruined the game from being playable on my device and NOW this update has done the same for Angry Birds RIO! What the h-e-double hockey stick is going on? Calling Amazon does nothing, while willing to issue a refund (which I appreciated), they claim they are \\"not aware of any issues\\". Do they even read their own comment boards??? This really may be the responsibility of the developers to fix. So, Developers -- FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for two apps that I can now NOT USE. My next course of action is to notify the Better Business Bureau for fraud.
0440246008|5.0|\\"The Hard Way\\" is the tenth installment in Lee Child's mystery/thriller series featuring ex-Army MP Jack Reacher. After leaving the Army, Jack has drifted from place to place, and as the story opens, he's sitting outside a cafe on Sixth Avenue in New York City enjoying an espresso. The espresso is so good that Reacher returns the following night.  As he relaxes and takes in the scene, Reacher is approached by a man who asks him questions about what he observed the night before. He returns with the man to the apartment of his boss, Edward Lane, a former Delta Force colonel, who is now the head of a large mercenary organization made up of men that formerly served in elite military units. Reacher learns that Lane's young wife, Kate, and her young daughter from a previous marriage, Jade, have been kidnapped and the ransom was left in a car parked outside the cafe where Reacher was sitting. Lane wants to know what Reacher saw and if he can identify the person who drove the car away. Lane makes it clear that he doesn't want the police involved because his  first wife was kidnapped a few years before and was killed when her abductors found out that the FBI had been called. Reacher offers to help Lane to get his wife and step-daughter returned back unharmed.  From that point, the pace of the story picks up as there more ransom demands and the kidnappers are always one step ahead of Reacher's attempts to track them down. Eventually, Reacher is led to a remote village in England for a dramatic and exciting ending. Most readers of this series will probably agree that \\"The Hard Way\\" is one of the best. Besides having lots of action, Reacher needs to piece together many clues to figure out who's the mastermind behind what's going on. Child also introduces interesting characters, including the ex-FBI agent who botched the first kidnapping and a mercenary who worked for Lane and was captured and held prisoner for many years in Africa. My only caution is that if you're somewhat squeamish, this book may not be for you. It contains some very brutal and horrific descriptions of torture and young Jade is also threatened with violence that may upset some readers.

1400069181|5.0|WOW!!!  I loved this book.  The way the information was presented made me want to keep reading.  I loved the stories of other businesses that are charity based and how they started and are now thriving.  The need in the world is huge and it may seem impossible to do anything, but this book gives you small doable solutions to help out others.<br /><br />Have you ever thought that you are only one person and cannot do anything to help...well read this book and you will know that there are tons of things you can do every day to help someone somewhere.  I read this book in one setting and I couldn't put it down.  The personal stories and the stories of others brought the book to life.  Why not have a business that is for-profit and for helping those in need.  If we don't have enough then how can we help anyone?<br /><br />This is a book that everyone out there should read and think about.  What can you do?  Anything is something to someone out there in need.  I will be making this book and a pair of TOMS part of my Christmas giving this year.  Get this book and start something that matters...no matter how small someone will be eternally grateful for what you do.  READ THIS BOOK TODAY!  The publisher is giving one book to a child in need for every book purchased.
159562015X|5.0|I read StrengthsFinder 2.0 after hearing about it from my husband, sister, and friends on staff at my church; all worked for places where it had been made a standard test, and everyone I talked to felt it was a valuable resource.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have mentioned, you buy the book (physical or Kindle) and receive a code for an online test. After you take the online test, you're given a list of your top 5 strengths. According to the trainer for a class I took locally, you're not given all 34 in order because the temptation would be to focus on the ones at the bottom -- your weaknesses, not your strengths. The point of the book is to focus on your strengths, thereby increasing your talents in those areas.<br /><br />When I took the test, I found that my job history really didn't match my list of strengths. In fact, it seemed to be a complete mismatch. I took the test after I'd been laid off, so I was considering where my career should go next, and the results definitely swayed my course. I pursued -- and landed -- a job that closely matches my strengths but is way outside a lot of my job history and outside the industry where I'd been working.<br /><br />You may not have such a monumental change from one book, but it's great to know what your strengths are so you can use them appropriately in your business and personal life.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|I enjoyed the first movie.  I didn't think the second was as bad as everyone thought.  Wow, this one was just  atrocious.  I'm not going into specifics as I'm sure the other reviews have but do not spend the $4.99 on downloading this.  Wait for it to come out on HBO or whatever.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I love how I can scroll thru the different fx before snapping the picture. I have Retro Camera, which is a great app, but you can't see how your pic will look with one of the cameras without actually taking one and then looking  at it. This is so much better! One snap and it's right the first time.  I'm an avid scrapbooker and budding photographer, and this app will help me with both.
B004LROMSO|3.0|CAMELOT is produced by the Starz network, and the fact that they don't have deep pockets is evident in nearly every frame of this series.  It's a very ambitious project, but unfortunately, it pales somewhat in comparison to similar \\"medieval\\" themed series such as GAME OF THRONES.  It just feels a bit rushed.  To be honest, the production values are roughly on par with shows like XENA and HERCULES...but in those shows, the cheesiness was part of the fun.  Here, it is a distraction.  CAMELOT tells the familiar tale of young King Arthur.  In fact, in many ways, it tells the story in much the way that the great John Boorman film EXCALIBUR did.  It tries for a gritty, slightly graphic (both in terms of violence and sex) approach...and I appreciate that.  Arthur is not just some shiny \\"good guy\\" but is full of foibles and faults, particularly in the early going when he feels so very uncertain about his task and his own abilities.  There are some familiar faces.  I had initially been very optimistic about Joseph Fiennes playing Merlin...but his performance is over-the-top and really shows no effort on his part to build a credible character. Eva Green LOOKS great as Merlin's foil Morgana...but she's never been much of an actress and doesn't bring much heft or real menace to the role.    The show has lovely locations and pretty terrific costumes, I must say.  It is just very pleasant to look at.  In the end, I think shoddy writing and low-budget effects make this only passably watchable.  I'm not a huge Arthurian Legend buff, just a casual fan.  This show might generate more enjoyement from hard core appreciators of those stories.  I'll stick with EXCALIBUR and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Really like this app! Very easy to use. You CAN import existing pictures. The controls are simple. Definitely my new camera app!
B001NXBRJG|5.0|Did \\"The Matrix\\" change Hollywood. Maybe?   I remember seeing this for the 1st time in theaters. Honestly, I only saw a couple of tv spots before seeing it, so I did not expect much. \\"Just another mindless action movie\\" I thought. This movie totally blew me away and then some. I was right there with Neo every step of the way. I realized at the same time Neo realized what IT was. The film had a very bladerunner/film noir type atmosphere and the music made that even better, so the movie has a good setting. The action was also pretty impressive for the time because that type of action was rarely (if ever) seen in a Hollywood movie. It was the type of thing you'd see only in Hong Kong action films or Japanese animation. And that's where the problem begins.  The Matrix has been copied so many times in the past 12 years and these Matrix-like cash-ins sometimes make me forget how awesome the movie really is. If only screenwriters were inspired by the smarter-than-average script and started writing their own smart scripts. What we got instead (for more than a decade) was very mediocre movies with horrible \\"matrix style\\" action. The Matrix is a great movie, but I think it might be the reason why we got a crap load of silly movies.  The blu-ray is wonderful. Picture quality is amazing and very sharp. I'm not happy about their decision to color correct the film so that it can match the two sequels, but it still looks very good. Sound is great as well. Most of the special features are things I have on DvD already, but there are a couple of new things like the critics' commentary and philosophers' commentary. They also made the 41 audio tracks from \\"The Matrix Revisited\\" easy to access; they were hidden items on \\"The Matrix Revisited\\" DvD.   Overall, it's worth buying if you like the film and haven't gotten it on blu ray yet. 5 stars!!
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Works as promised... Nice morph of both new and existing pics.  Was able to download the 'sketchified' pic and further enhance it in Corel PaintShop.... Very impressive.
1609611543|5.0|Fantastic book!! I will recommend it to everybody who wants to improve their health and want to stay away from medications!!
0399242600|5.0|This wonderful, oversized board book is fun for children of any age!  The story unfolds through the colorful and funny pictures that are meant to be studied and laughed at.  This book is sure to get some good conversations going between the adults and children who share it.  It's definitely a \\"go to\\" book!  Enjoy!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I find this Blu-Ray movie to be very good like the Firefly series. Still great to add to any collection
B002ZG97RE|1.0|Did not enjoy at all.  Very political in it's message but not possible. Other countries had our same intel.  Saddam would not let the United Nation inspectors in so it seemed he was hiding something.  He and his people had plenty of warnings.  It was almost a joke.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Perfectly paced. This book will surely inspire many people! The book is the best book ever! You just can't stop reading once you pick up this story!
B004EI2NM2|5.0|I happened upon the reviews for Room in rome looking for something else. The negative reviewers must have been watching a different movie. There are so many things I loved about this movie. The lies we tell ourselves and others. Were the actors naked? Barely noticed, I was so engrossed in the story and their interaction. Many parts of this story reminded me of times in my life. My girlfriend and I love this cute little movie. I suggest the negative reviews watch it again.
B005J0VPNC|1.0|slow, clunky and pretty much boring.  i am on the hunt for a whothwhile camera app and since this one was offered for free on Amazon i thought i would give it a try.  yuck.  some of the effects are cool, but this is it.  save your money
B001FB4W0W|5.0|If you love True Blood you'll love this! The extra's are great and I love that I can watch them whenever.
1847879071|5.0|An easy read and makes difficult concepts understandable.  The author's humor is sometimes a bit sophomoric...but at the same time is entertaining.  I would definitely recommend this text!
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This is probably one of her best albums yet! Everyone should buy it. The music is very catchy and easily gets stuck in your head (which is a good thing) =p  Every song has a different message to it, one of the best motivational albums I've ever bought. I love Lady Gaga.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I got this app for free from getjar a month our so ago. it's not an app that will revolutionize your picture taking, and yes there are apps that can take a normal picture you already have and do these things (picsin magic), but this does have stone really cool artistic effects and you can see them before you take the pic so you know what you're going to get right away.<br /><br />It's certainly worth 99 cents, but maybe not 1.99, however for free, it's a steal.
0061743526|5.0|Having seen the incredible film To Kill a Mocking Bird twice, it appeared as if there could be nothing more that can be derived from the book. But reading the book is a reminder that films may not do full justice to a book. There are many examples; for instance, The Motorcycle Diaries, which show how a book is adapted partly to fit a 300 page book in 2 hours, and partly to get the maximum approval from cinemagoers. This is no way devalues the film, but it reminds us that there may be much more in the book that may not reach cinemagoers.  The main story in the book is well known but not being aware of American names, it was interesting  to learn that the author is female. But beyond that minor point, the book is not very long  compared to modern fiction where authors seem to be competing to make a book as long as possible), but very precisely written, and is very captivating. The language used in the book reminds a British reader in particular of the geographical and time context of the  story. Each scene is beautifully described and the pictures remain in the reader's mind for a long time.  It is not  simple tale of a white lawyer trying to apply justice to a black defendant wrongly accused of a crime. Justifications of the treatment of black people by the white community is accompanied by the questions many whites were asking about the treatment of blacks. At the same time, the humane behaviour of black people is very astutely portrayed.  There are many other aspects of life that come out very clearly in the book : sibling relationships, friendship, the innocence of youth and many others. Anyone who has not read the book has missed out on a great deal. Anyone who reads the book will find it leaves a very strong lasting impression on them
0446585025|5.0|Spending time with Ellen is to fall into her happier world. This offering is funnier than her other 2, so be forewarned in case you are planning to read it on a plane, or while you're waiting for jury duty, or anywhere that suddenly bursting out laughing could be a problem.
B005G48Y58|4.0|A pretty good girl action movie with enough grit to keep it interesting. It is very well shot and edited, though there are enough holes in the story to keep it from being more than an entertaining evening's fare.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Excellent service, excellent product! I would use the company again.  Package arrived promptly and without hassle.  Godd job guys.  Looking forward to the next transaction.
B003L77G6A|5.0|i love this show! i really like how if you preorder a tv show like this on amazon and the price goes down they charge you for the cheapest price. i order many things from amazon for their great service and great deals. it was delivered to me the day after it came out. this show is hilarious can not wait to order the next few seasons! over all very pleased!
B00466HN86|5.0|Courageous was a wonderful movie. God is so caring and no matter what obstetrical you come to in life with the help of the lords strength you can conquer anything. This movie touched me I hope everyone can see this movie and it opens up everyone's* eyes to the love of Jesus Christ. The lord is always with us no matter what.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Having bought the entire collection in normal DVD format, I had to convert to Blu-ray when it became available.  This brought an entirely new dimension to the Rocky series, thanks for the opportunity.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it was wonderful.  Another amazing book by Rick Riordan.  I can't wait to read the next one , The Son Of Neptune.  If anyone wants to read a great book, read this.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Like everyone else I have been longing for these movies on blu-ray.  The wait was worth it.  I have already watched all six of the films and they look and sound spectacular.  I'm not one of the many that is upset about Luca's changes/improvements to the original trilogy.  With the exception of \\"who shot first\\" in the bar I like all the changes and additions that George Lucas made to these films.  The original trilogy (episodes 4, 5, and 6) really looks amazing with deep blacks and bright colors and details.  A little graininess but not much.  I saw details of things I have never noticed before and I've seen these movies many many times.  The second trilogy (episodes 1, 2, and 3) might be the best looking blu-ray movies I have ever seen.  Really spectacular.  No graininess whatsoever and great detail.  I had a great time watching these films and I can't wait to start watching all the extra material.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|Good shape, condition and early delivery. Makes a person want to chill out and just have fun! LOL Saw advertisement of the remake and decided to search for the original. I hit the jackpot on the price too!
B005J0VPNC|4.0|awesome app, there are lots of opportunities to let your creative side out. would be cool if it supported video recording!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I bought this a week or so ago from the Google Android Market, and was instantly happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Unlike many other photo altering apps, this one actually runs in real time.  Very awesome.  The results are fantastic, and better than many other apps that cost much more.  I love that I can use it on gallery shots, too, so I don't actually have to shoot the photos in the paper camera and be 'stuck' with just one special effect.<br /><br />I'm glad this is free so I can get my wife a copy of it, as well as 'bank' a copy for my son's upcoming Android-based Christmas present.<br /><br />Seriously, it's work the $2, and if you can get it for free you'll be glad you clicked that buy button.
1423140591|5.0|Bought this book for my boys and they loved it! Riordan is popular amongst the young readers. Just wish his books get completed and published quicker.  That's a compliment to his popularity.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is my first review I have ever written on here, and I've had FAOTD for a long time. This app is awesome. Honestly if I knew it had worked this good, I would have bought it sooner.  It's definitely worth 2 bucks.  You can edit you gallery pictures by pressing one of the button on the bottom of the screen. I spent 20 minutes just playing around with the effects and buttons to see what it could do. Don't pay any attention to the less than five star reviews.  Try it out, and you will see. If don't like it, uninstall.  That simple.
B002ZG99TK|4.0|This movie surprised me when I saw it at the theater.  It is an edge of your seat thriller and a lot of fun.  I knew I would have to purchase the blu-ray when it came out because it looked and sounded great in the theater.  The special effects are way above average and everything looks real.  The acting is good as well.  The soundtrack is especially noteworthy - these trains will shake your walls!
1423140591|4.0|My sons have been anxiously waiting for this book since they read the first in the new series, of continuing series depending on how you look at it.  It is a good read.  To get away from the book itself, be warned that the Amazon shipping department threw the book in loose with another large loose item in a box twice the size needed with no packing or paper.  The cover of the book got ruined when it came off in shipping.  It is not worth my time to bother to return it to Amazon for a new cover.  Thanks for nothing Amazon.  This is the first time I have been disappointed in Amazon.
030788743X|5.0|ever. Although I love to read, and do it often, I don't think i've ever taken the time to stop and write a review, until now. This book made me do it. I was immersed from the start. Being a child of the 80s myself this book spoke to me. I remember the Commodore 64, and Tandy computer, and arcades, and Colecovision, and atari 64. I remember the first time I played Super Mario Brothers in an arcade, and Double Dragon. I remember Legend and Labirynth and Back to the Future, and Sixteen Candles and Gremlins and Goonies and Aliens. And this book brought me back to all of that. I could imagine being a kid immersed in a world full of lore from a time of my life filled with so much joy and wonder and naivete of youth. This book grabbed me and made it so I hated to put it down. Now i'm mad I rushed to the end and didn't stop to take the time to enjoy more every remembrance of my childhood. This is a fantastic book, with a fantastic story and a predictable and still fantastic ending. Bravo Mr. Cline, Bravo. You have just gained a new fan.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I have watched an amazing amount of anime, I also own more than i can handle so i feel i have a decent understanding of which anime are worth watching and those that are not. With that being said, this is easily one of the best anime i have ever seen. The plot is thick, the characters are very well fleshed out, and the plot twists/ending were both exhilerating and held my interest every time I've watched it. I would definately say this is a family oriented film, especially considering that family is a major element.   All-in-All this is a great anime. I would suggest that you watch with friends and family or just that special someone, but if you like anime watch summer wars
0385344325|2.0|Jack Reacher is my kind of hero. He's afraid of no living human being and is not afraid of gratuitous violence. Unfortunately, his modus is getting awfully stale. There are 2 sets of characters: Jack and some of the good townspeople, and the villains and some of the bad townspeople. The plot is mostly senseless and the descriptive part of the book mind numbing filler. The whole affair is about breaking a bully's nose. The violence is way better then the sex. These books are terrible, but I can't wait for the next one.   What does that say about me?
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun, addictive, makes you think a bit. The little monster just makes me smile....Got some friends hooked as well.  Love this game.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|so glad I waited till this was free.  I have been wanting to try it.  I like photofunia much better.  A lot more options as well as a few other photo manipulation apps.  this ia not a bad app, just not over the top either.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I purchase it thru the market andriod and it works great, I can receive email from microsoft office documents and open the attachment and read with out any problem. its a most to have if you are working out of your tablet.
0307946711|5.0|I was thinking to go to the movie, but I'm kind of busy during this academic semester. So I bought the book. I love the content. It's truly a lovely story. By he way,I really got a better discount!
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This app is pretty nice, I was considering getting it when it was. 99 but missed the sale. The app gives a live preview of the effect chosen which is quite nice but for my phone it can only render about 5frames a second, definitely not something that could satisfyingly be turned into a video app. my complaints are that the snapp noise can not be removed in app-I find it obnoxious as its nothing like the sexy snap of an SLR camera and thus pointless... Pictures must be taken with the in app button which can be a pain if your shooting 1handed. tapping the screen would be more convenient. Also the app will not switch to portrait mode,its landscape only. Each filter has settings to change how dramatic it is and simple changes like contrast and brightness.
B005974CDU|4.0|This has to be the most listenable DT CD in years.  I was worried after many disappointments in recent years ... as I can't tell you the last time I've listened to any of their most recent releases.  Those CDs were spun a handful of times and then forgotten.  While I continue to think that the current DT suffers lyrically and Rudess is the weak link (I find his playing soulless most of the time - and certainly excessive) ... \\"Outcry\\" and \\"Breaking All Illusions\\" makes up for those weaknesses.  \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" seems to take some criticism in posted reviews but it is a solid piece.  They seem, overall, more coherent and cohesive and it shows in the result.  The CD remains in constant rotation for me (along with the most recent Fair To Midland CD) and that's a sign, to this non-musician, of the quality.  So, overall, recommended.  Now if only they used an outside producer ...
B0055DNH0C|5.0|I love this album.  A lot of great tracks, especially the ones that you don't hear on the radio.  Makes me feel like I am back in South Florida when I listen to this.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|I have to agree with a lot of folks here , I thought JW was done , glad Roots proves there is something left in the tank ! Been a Johnny fan since the 70's and saw him live 5 times in the 80's & early 90's . His voice sounds great here , his guitar chops are not what they once were but his is no spring chicken anymore with all the health problems and all he has battled with over the years . These blues standards have been Johnny-rized and give them his own touch . I would like to comment on any specific track but I love them all . If you are a Johnny fan and are not sure to get this or not , GET IT !! Go Johnny Go !
B005J0VPNC|4.0|I use an HTC EVO 3D. It let's me apply filters to existing photos from my gallery. I just hit the &quot;3 lines&quot; near the &quot;camera&quot; / shutter button and it lets me pick old photos to manipulate.
B0058A119G|5.0|I previously said that Love Is The Answer (the combo version) was Barbra's best album in four decades and I still stand by that.  As for this new album, amazingly I'd say it's her next best album in four decades!  I don't know what is going on with Barbra, but she finally seems to be relinquishing a bit of control for warmth and spontaneity.  Those are the things that have been missing from her recordings since at least around Superman in the late 70s.    In fact, this new album feels almost, dare I say it, casual.  Barbra concentrates on the lyrics and doesn't seem to be worrying about perfectionism.  She allows that rasp in, does some mild humming/scatting, even laughs again on record.  Nice to see you again Barbra!  I really like the move into Bossa Nova that Barbra showed on her last album, and here on What Matters Most.  In fact, I think it would make a great concept album for her.  Another great concept would be just a single guitar accompanied album.  Barbra is becoming that intimate a singer and it would be a terrific move.  And I'm particularly pleased that Barbra is the producer on this album.  I was worried that it was Diana Krall that got Barbra to loosen up on Love Is The Answer, but it appears that Barbra has loosened herself up.  Keep them coming Barbra, you've never been better!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this app, but after downloading it, I think it's pretty cool.  It adds some real neat effects to pictures already in your phone, or you can snap new shots with the effect added.  Multiple effects to choose from as well.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Very cool app. If you miss getting it free it is definitely worth two bucks. And to the idiots, you can alter the pics in your gallery. Samsung Galaxy 7.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Anthrax has been among the biggest names in the metal industry. So with return of Joey Belladonna on vocals for Worship Music it was always going to have to live up expectations and that it has. Right from the start this CD kicks ass!
B001BPQT8A|5.0|I watched SE7EN almost weekly back in my film school days and got to know the images very VERY well.  So you can understand the gravity of things when I say that watching SE7EN on Blu-ray is like watching it for the first time all over again.  In some cases, it's like watching a completely different film altogether.  The Blu-Ray transfer is nothing short of INCREDIBLE.  The textures and shadows almost defy belief, and the film grain--when present--is simply delicious.  What amazed me most about this transfer is HOW MUCH COLOR is in this film.  Yellows, and browns and greens that were almost nonexistent on the DVD pop out like ripe fruit on the vine.  I've been so accustomed to the muted and high-contrasted VHS/DVD editions with their near monochrome color palette that for the entire first viewing, I felt that they had digitally ALTERED the whole film like O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU.  A consequence of this is that the film is shockingly brighter than ever before; details that I never even saw before are as clear as day, and as a result, the film seems more grimy and less oppressive.  With this increased luminance, the film dates a bit...it reminds me of the PAYBACK Blu-ray (another excellent Blu-ray you need to get) where the restored color and texture deliberately evokes a specific time period.  In this case, SE7EN feels a little more like a 70s film than a post-modern 90s film, but in the end, it's still SE7EN.  There's only 2 downsides to this disc.  First, the extras are all upconverted exports from the 2000 DVD set (no HD retrospectives), which I felt should have gotten an upgrade.  Second, the blacks in a handful of scenes with almost NO ambient light at all seem devoid of texture...but at least they aren't crushed.  And this is such trivial nitpicking that I didn't even detract a full star and rounded up to five anyway.  All in all, this is a MUST OWN Blu-ray for videophiles like myself.  I really can't recommend it enough; it's up there with THE ROAD WARRIOR and SERENITY and PAYBACK.  My only regret is that the FIGHT CLUB  Blu-ray, with it's wonky grain and inconsistent shadows doesn't look HALF as good as this.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The Blu-ray offers a little better picture quality then the DVD but the sound (if you have external speakers) is what makes the upgrade worth it. Nothing beats having your walls shake when the train goes rumbling by. Now NETDEALZ who I purchased from through Amazon was another story. Before it even shipped the priced dropped $2 and within 5 days of me purchasing this and before it arrived it had gone from $18.69 to around $10. They would not match there own price and just all around bad customer service. So good product just bad seller.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Great music.  Hugh is a great piano player and a great singer.  He knows how to make it all work.  Has a great sound!
B000003C4K|5.0|Exodus are one of the best thrash bands even though they didn't get as much attention as several others. Bonded by Blood is my favorite, Paul Baloff was the best vocalist also. He left and Steve Souza replaced him. In early 2002 he died of a stroke and hasn't been in the band for a long time but he's still the best, in my opinion. Bonded by Blood is one of the best albums in thrash/speed metal. It's all good but A Lesson in Violence is my personal favorite track.
B003S6T62Q|5.0|OMG!! Joe Live From Japan DVD is absolutely wonderful! Joe's lyrical writings, vocals, guitar musicianship and committment to excellence is evident throughout his performance. All the musicians in the band are \\"beasts\\" with their individual artistry. Tonal quality, timing and the ability to compliment Joe's vocals on every song is the best. I highly recommend this well-produced DVD. Thanks, Joe! Blessings
B005LZZMRK|5.0|I already know there are more than enough five star reviews for this album, but having had a week and a half to digest it, I feel like I can safely rate this.  The height of my interest in Steven Wilson/Porcupine Tree occurred four years ago, when Fear of a Blank Planet was released, and then when Insurgentes came out.  At this time, I felt Wilson couldn't possibly do any better, and indeed, The Incident was disappointing.  So, the last two years, I've been listening to primarily acoustic music, and only keeping select progressive rock/metal bands in the corner of my eye.  When Grace For Drowning was announced months ago, I figured I'd like it, but I was very open to the possibility of being disappointed.  This was especially true after hearing Remainder the Black Dog, Track One, Index, and Like Dust I Have Cleared From My Eye before the release date.  These tracks all had pieces I liked, but they struck me as a little too abstract and unfocused.  When I received the vinyl edition in the mail, I immediately spun it.  The tracks that didn't really grab me on Youtube really spoke to me when coming from vinyl, and through my stereo system.  At that point, I knew this was a good record.  How good remained to be seen.  Three days later (a week ago), I got the deluxe edition in the mail.  That night, I listened to the 5.1 surround sound blu ray, and the quality of the sound had me in awe.  This is the best sounding music I've ever heard.  It sounds like Steven is in the room with you when Like Dust begins.  Now that I'm getting more of a feel for the structure, I'm finding that the music is brilliant.  It is abstract, but it flows perfectly.  I love the way the first disc starts especially, with no lyrics until the third track...And when those lyrics start, it sounds all the more surreal.  What makes this album truly great is the fact that it is a complete artistic package.  Besides the excellent music, and perfect sound, the Lasse Hoile-directed artwork, photography, andvideos are just as important a part of this album.  There is just so much to explore here.  Usually when I see a deluxe edition of an album selling for $80+, I think it looks cool, but is ultimately overpriced.  This deluxe package, friends, is worth the $80 plus shipping. (link to some pictures in comments.)  I will say, this is not good driving music.  The dynamic range is so vibrant that you miss all the quiet parts, and on this album, the quiet parts are the most important.  Steven Wilson has outdone himself... again.  Even though I'm listening to more Punch Brothers, Neil Young, Josh Ritter, Trampled By Turtles, et al. than anyone else, I just can't help but keep coming back to Mr. Wilson's work.
B0058M62ZM|5.0|My sons got this when he was 15 month.  He loves this book and can mimic the sound of all the animals in this book.  I have no idea how he recognizes all these figures. Anyway, it is a colorful book, which can easily attract baby's attention.<br /><br />By the way, for young babies, I would suggest to get board book instead of hard cover version, which is easy to get torn.
B001IF252M|1.0|1. Does not work with my 2011 Macbook Air. Got a replacement from the Apple Store. Works with no problems<br /><br />2. Filled in a request for a refund.<br /><br />3. Apart from not working, the cable is very cheaply made and not up to mark with the version I got from the Apple store.<br /><br />AVOID at all costs!
B003HKN52A|5.0|I purchased this DVD simply to replace my old VHS Tape.  This video is exceptional.  I purchased it originally to get the videos of Elvis in the 1970's.  The concerts shown of his Las Vegas performances show Elvis at what I consider to be at his peak.
B000YDE46Y|4.0|Morning. First off, let's talk about the fast delivery! I placed this order on Tuesday. They took a day to process it and I received the shoes on Thursday! Very fast delivery. I'm very impressed. As for the shoes, mine feel a little big. I wear a 10.5 and I do have a tad bit more room than I'm used to. I would advise you to use your own discretion; however, ordering a half size smaller is an option to consider. Regarding the style of shoe, I love it. It has that modern worker yet casual night out feel to it. I hope this helps. I would definitely order from [...] via Amazon again! Lol.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|It's an ok app, average at best being free I say get it have fun with it or uninstall it. I enjoy camera apps so about half the effects I already have but the ones I don't have are neat. I my self would not pay for it but I trend to be a little cheap on apps being so many similar apps of nearly every genre being offered for free, that's just me.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This app is awesome. Easy to use, there aren't too many options which is surprisingly nice, and its fun. You CAN use photos in your gallery as well as snap photos from the program. The only small problem is the slidebars are rather small... but that's hardly worth mentioning. I love this app!
0525423281|5.0|I don't think there's much more I can say about Stephanie Perkins' awesomeness or the unique feel-good dreaminess of her books, that has not already been said. Lola and the Boy Next Door is another contemporary YA romance masterpiece just like Anna and the French Kiss was.  Anna was my TOP favorite book last year. It must be hard to follow up such an amazing debut. But Perkins did it flawlessly. While I felt Anna was mainly focused on setting development, I think Lola was more focused on character development. The parent's relationship was so powerful and felt so absolutely real that it drew me in to the point that I felt myself wishing I had two gay parents. It's an extraordinary family portrayal unlike any other I've experienced or read about. And this felt SO refreshing!  Needless to say that my expectations were high in the boy department. While I don't think Cricket reached the levels of *drool* that St. Clair did, I think he was very well done and very swoon-worthy. I specially loved all the boy next door dynamics. And Lola! Okay. Lola was whoa. Probably one of the most memorable characters you will ever read! Absolutely loved her.  Also, don't you hate all these instant romances in all other sub-genres of YA?  I'm sorry but I don't quite buy it. Love happens, and it's complicated, and it takes time, and sometimes it works in weird awful ways, and others it just doesn't. I'm so delighted to read an author who can actually portray the innocence of teen years with the depth of the feelings in a believable manner. Not that there aren't others who do it as well, but this story just has a something that feels more true and relatable. And that is WHY I read.  If you want to read about truly authentic teens in a light yet deeply loveable story, this is THE book for you!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I don't write reviews very often but this is an awesome app. Very addictive and fun. Can't stop taking pictures!
B003UJ8YOC|5.0|It came on time and in great condition, especially for its age. The packaging was safe and secure, and it plays great, just great. I was very satisfied.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is a neat little camera app. I like the set of filters that are included, and being able to apply them to photos in the gallery is a nice touch. Very simple to use.<br /><br />One of the things I have found with the camera on my gTablet is that it is a very basic camera that takes &quot;ok&quot; pictures. Having effects to apply to the camera makes it a lot more fun to use.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|Simply put, this version stinks.  Amazon should mme make an effort to keep up with current stable apps; especially with rapidly evolving areas like social networking.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|There is no question as to why Adele is setting the world on fire.  Today's generation has not yet seen or heard a genuine musician, period, let alone someone as talented as this woman.  At only 23 years of age (currently), Adele has created the most refreshing, groundbreaking pop music album in at least a decade.  '21' contains all of the ingredients which make up a truly memorable album: captivating lyrics, vocals so raw and honest your heart will race and your eyes will tear upon hearing them, perfect musical arrangement and melody throughout each song and last but not least, diversity.  No two songs sound alike. Instrumentally some may sound similar, but each song dynamically changes throughout, making this entier album a true feast for the senses.  In my opinion, Adele is the most interesting, talented and promising up-and-coming R&B/pop star of this era, without a doubt.  This is a very special album, an instant classic.  You will not be able to stop listening to it in its entirety.  It will hit you hard and will seem as though you are listening to a musician of the mid-1900s.  True soul music.
B000W799NU|5.0|This movie is a must for any harry potter fan.  If you read the book, you must see this movie.  Now is the time to buy the movie with Amazon, great value.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|Neat effects, seems resource intensive on my Galaxy S, seems to have locked up my phone after taking several pictures. Uploaded some fun \\"Take on Me\\" style photos on Facebook.  Got it as a free app of the day, I'd have been very disappointed otherwise, because of a weird side effect; another, non-phone application (Medscape!?) keeps trying to launch when I take a picture.  The lockup and app launching cost it more stars.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|on the droid bionic it doesn't always start up the camera, and when it does it is not all that fantastic of an app.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was not a huge fan of the first SwiftKey, I didn't like the type a few letters and then hope it predicted the right word gimmick. However, the new auto correct engine in this keyboard is second to none. I can type what I want with blatant disregard for pinpoint accuracy and expect to see very few errors, if any. The only changes I would like to see are more skin selections and swapping the location of the SwiftKey button with another, such as the exclamation point. This keyboard is stupid-fast.
B0057FWSQ2|5.0|Genial, simplemente genial.  Tiene todas las canciones que deben ser, ideal para comenzar a conocerla.  Letras y música excelentes y en las versiones originales; habría estado bien una versión doble con las mismas canciones re-hechas (parecido a lo que hizo Kate)
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I love this album.  Hugh Laurie has chosen a a variety of New Orleans blues songs for this CD, and performed them with enthusiasm and soulfulness.  The musicians are first rate, including the guest vocalists.  How can you go wrong with singers like Dr. John, Tom Jones and Irma Thomas.  Laurie's singing voice is not of the highest quality, but his enthusiasm makes up for it.  If you get a chance to see it don't miss the PBS Great Performances episode of Let Them Talk.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I didn't think I'd like this, but I was wrong.  It's very well done,  and is challenging without being frustratingly impossible.
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|Great game, very well done even if it is a bit of a battery hog. The only problem I've had is with it crashing once in a great while. I lose everything that had happened since I started that session EVEN IF I SAVED since I started. It has happened twice now and I've lost a lot of progress. It'll get 5 stars when it's fixed.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|To put it as succinctly as can be said, his first album 'Clear As Day' is exactly as as we would have imagined it. From his American Idol audition in January, to his spectacular 100 million + vote Idol win in May, to his triumphant American Idol Live Tour, to his stellar first album, Scotty McCreery has stayed 100% true to himself and his music. He has matured more in less than a year, than most artists do in a lifetime. Each individual song on this cd is fantastic in it's own right, however, collectively they have a profound cohesion made possible by Scotty's sincere and honest connection to each and every song. These songs are like extensions to the Scotty McCreery that millions of us fell in love with on Idol and if you are one of those that \\"got\\" what Scotty is about you will really love this superb first cd.   Congratulations Scotty!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|While watching this epic I noticed the human characters didn't help the movie.  I would have much liked to see their final battle on a machine planet much like their own world. Perhaps the creators of Transformers 4 will remedy this in the next film.  I found myself wanting to see what happened before the war. The CGI was amazing.  Leonard Nimoy's voice as the ancient mentor to Optimus Prime was the best part of the movie. Nimoy even used a line he did in the Star Trek II feature film; only in a different context. I wanted to know more about the robots than the human characters.  Ironically, the humans took a back seat to the dynamic robots on the screen.  I certainly didn't buy this DVD so I could see a model with the lead actor, Shia La Bouf (I know I didn't spell that right).<br /><br />The director did a seamless job with the actors interacting with the robots. That must be the hardest type of acting. Talking to a green screen with a character that hasn't been fully developed.<br /><br />Another aspect of this movie that was impressive was the destruction of the city in the last moments of the film. The fault of this film was that it could have been a half hour shorter.  There were too many false and predictable moments that could have been on the cutting room floor. Other than that, it was fun to watch. I'd see it again for the battling robot portions of the film.
0307987647|5.0|This is the second book in this wonderful series. I own the first book on cd and immensely enjoyed it as do I this one. I am almost finished with it and I am already looking for the 3rd book.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I thought the movie was awesome and beyond funny. Some people have no sense of humor is the problem, da teachers do not talk to students that way that is what makes it so funny and no I do not do drugs as some say only way for it to be funny. I was sober as could be and laughed and laughed and so did my boyfriend.
078322737X|4.0|George Lucas's harking back to the days of his own youthful years in small town America remains a fascinating look at \\"cruising\\" and the American teen \\"Rock'n'Roll\\" lifestyles of the late 50's/early 60's. Set in the 1960's, 'American Graffiti' is as much about the end of the 50's as it is about the end of the teenagers school days and their excitement, trepidation and anticipation of the immediate future that awaits them.  Set over the course of a single night, the story focuses on four boys, each of whom was supposed to represent Lucas at different stages in the teen years. Curt (Richard Dreyfuss), Steve (Ron Howard), John (Paul Le Mat) and Terry (Charles Martin Smith) are all friends in the small town of Modesto, California (where Lucas grew up), whose individual stories intertwine throughout the film. Curt is in a dilemma about whether he should or shouldn't head off to college in the morning, Steve is more interested in getting his leg over his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) before he goes off to college too, John is facing the fact the he his getting a little too old for his \\"hotrod king\\" image and spends the night accidentally cruising around town with a 12 year old teenybopper passenger and Terry, \\"The Toad\\", who has always been unlucky with girls finds that he is in for a night of changes too.  The story, like all of Lucas's stories, is very simple. But, it's handled with great care and allows the viewer (even those who have never experienced 50's America, like me) to become engrossed in the accounts of the young men and how they deal with the evening's events. Because the story doesn't include silly 50's movies cliches, it becomes easier to believe that these people are real people and not some characters in a cheap 'Rebel without a cause' knockoff. It's also helped by the fact that 50's vehicles and buildings are included in the film too. The Diner where the kids meet was re-opened just for the film (and demolished after it wrapped) and the charming 50's cars on offer make all the difference. Shot in 1972, it must have been odd for the locals of the town where the film was shot (Petaluma) to see all these 50's relics rolling up and down the strip, where some of them had 20 years before.  'American Graffiti' was a sleeper hit in 1973 when it was released, despite the fact that Lucas had incredible trouble trying to get funding for his film from several different studios. Universal actually wanted to release it as a TV move only. This would have proven to have been a huge mistake as the film went on to be one of the highest gross's ever, in terms of cost to profit. At a cost of about $1½ million to make and market, `American Graffiti' went on to make over $200 million, with theatrical and video releases.  Unfortunately, it was also responsible for kick starting the truly awful 'Happy days', which marred television with unfunny comedy for the next 10 years.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|very cool effects. its free, get it now! can make your pics into cartoons. i love it very very very very muc
0756404738|4.0|Before reading this book I re-read the first book in the series The name of the Wind and I found that to be a delightful read because I had forgotten almost the entire story.  Moving on this book I was very excited to see where Kvothe would go next.  I expected this book to be completely different from the last.  I was dissapointed with the first few hundred pages where it is just a redundant continuance of the social dramas and interplay at the University.  At one point I almost gave up on the book entirely And then something wonderful happened, the story started to change Kvothe was finally on the move again.  And with that movement the author got to open us up to the rest of the world And it was really nice.  I enjoyed the last three fourths of this book entirely.  I am looking forward to the next book, hopefully coming out sometime next year I fear that the there is too much to tell in one book. He has left a lot of mysteries left untied and it seems impossible for them all to be addressed in the next book I hope that he doesn't try to speed through them.  THe author has a tendency to breeze through entire segments in one or two paragraphs. This is frustrating because at times he lingers too long with social soap opera drama.  This book is best when Kvothe is on the move. And when it was moving it was a really nice read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|you know... it is funny how the second book in a tri~read series is always the worst. the hunger games really got me going on all this hunger game buisness. this book slowed me down again. its all just this uprising stuff from other districts. i really hope the next installment mockingjay will be better.
B0006VIE4C|4.0|Unfortunately, we still haven't got the original 1977 cinema version on DVD or Blu-Ray yet (except for the insulting non-anamorphic transfers of recent times) so this review is of the \\"bastardised\\" 2000's version. Albeit, with an improved (but still pointless) \\"Jabba\\" sequence, but it's still a pale viewing experience, when compared with the more streamlined original. Like 'Jaws' from 1975, 'Star Wars' represents the kicking off of the Summer blockbuster that has, unfortunately, diseased Hollywood for decades. However, in 1977, it was a truly spectacular event and such \\"event\\" movies were unheard of. 'Star Wars' was so successful, it made bucket-loads of money and knocked 'Jaws' off of it's \\"top earner\\" spot. It made a star out of carpenter Harrison Ford, household names out of the three leads, a multi-millionaire out of George Lucas and enabled one of the greatest trilogies ever to grace the screen.  It's funny to think now, but 'Star Wars' was very nearly a non-starter. Nobody was willing to pick it up, until 20th Century Fox took a huge gamble and threw a modest amount of money at Lucas and expected him to turn in a low budget, but respectable sci-fi flick. Little did they know that they were going to get the biggest cinema extravaganza that the movies ever produced. The studio would certainly not have figured that out from reading the script, which was a mish mash of nonsense depicting a princess in distress and a farm-boy who runs off with a wizard and a scoundrel to rescue her. The story was simple enough and rather hokey, but the vision that Lucas (and the many others involved) had, would elaborate on the paltry story and enable the viewer to buy into it. Such care was put into the visuals, that the story became believable within the realms of the world that was created, because the world that was created was filled with objects that looked used. They looked functional and operational. Gone was the sparkly \\"disco\\" Sci-Fi of 'Logan's Run' or the semi-future (but recognisably 70's) visions of the likes of 'Soylent Green'. Here we had a brand new world, something from \\"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\\" It was just never done before and it carried off a generation of imaginations and made obsessive's out of millions of 70's kids. In fact, so lovingly created was the world of 'Star Wars', it still stands up today, nearly 34 years later and even surpasses the more \\"modern\\" prequels, simply because the world was made up of sets, models and other tangible items, rather than...er...nothing.  'Star Wars' is far from perfect though. Often, the acting is weak, the story confusing (to some people) and the editing is so fast paced, that it can leave some people behind. But it never fails to entertain. And, in this form (the director's cut as it were), it has some appallingly bad inserts, including the aforementioned \\"Jabba sequence\\". Most of the \\"improvements\\" Lucas decided to put into 'Star Wars' helped to some degree. The computer aided clean-up of the picture was a good idea, as was upping the number of spacecraft on the screen in certain scenes. But, having silly edits like \\"Greedo\\" firing first and \\"Jabba\\" meeting with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) were so inept, it made me realise that the constraints that Lucas had imposed on him, both financially and time-wise, for the original 70's production were a good thing as it forced him to rethink his ideas, instead of simply going with them. The \\"Greedo\\" thing is absolutely laughable and has been the subject of many a \\"Han fired first\\" internet outrages since it first spoiled our memories in the 90's re-release. It actually nulls Han Solo's personality to a great degree. It takes his edge off and Lucas's explanation for the change was pathetic to say the least. In short, he didn't want to present a hero of his films firing without provocation. Considering Greedo was threatening to blow him away, Solo was well within his right. Not to mention \\"Greedo\\" manages to miss Solo fromjust 2 metres away, the whole scene ends up just looking stupid. Likewise, after Solo whacks Greedo, he meets up with Jabba the Hutt in a sequence that has always bothered Lucas as he simply didn't have the money or time to film the scene in the 70's. What a pity that changed, as the resulting insert ends up being so stupid and inept, that it could nearly ruin the entire film. It's a completely unnecessary inclusion and not only that, much of the dialogue from the Greedo scene several minutes earlier is repeated! Unfortunately, these interferences were not limited to 'Star Wars'. Lucas couldn't resist messing with 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi' too. The former got away with light changes, but the latter was destroyed in a similar way to 'Star Wars'.  Hopefully, we will get the original versions released on DVD, complete with cleanups and anamorphic presentations and fans can forget the \\"Lucas\\" versions. But, many fans feel that the 'Star Wars' saga has been wrecked, irreparably, by Lucas's misguided decisions to \\"fix\\" the original trilogy and produce the absolutely awful prequels, not to mention the glut of subpar cartoons, comics and books that have saturated the once excellent universe that carried away so many kids in the 70's and 80's.
B003UESJF6|4.0|`Megamind' doesn't feel like something new, in fact it feels like something I've seen a few times already, but that doesn't take away from the comic nature of the beast and the fact that, at its heart, it is still a pretty memorable film.  Enlisting big names in comedy like Will Ferrell and Tina Fey along with newcomer Jonah Hill (who is easily the funniest character in the film) and superstar Brad Pitt was a smart move, especially since their voices lend themselves well to voice over work (you may think it's easy to `voice a cartoon', but you really have to have the right voice for it).<br /><br />The film tells the story of two young orphans, both aliens who are transported to Earth when their home planets are being destroyed.  Young Megamind and Metro Man have an instant rivalry considering that their fates were so very different.  Pegged as the loser, the outcast, the shamed one since he was ten days old, Megamind began to resent others and soon he embraced the only thing he was good at, being bad.  Metro Man, on the other hand, became swallowed up in his own ego, having others fawn all over his heroic acts and soon he became a hero, a legend in his own time.  The citizens of Metro City watched with baited breath as Metro Man consistently defeated Megamind, until...<br /><br />Metro Man was killed.<br /><br />After finally getting his wish and defeating Metro Man, Megamind realizes that his evil ways are pointless if he doesn't have someone to battle.  It was too easy being bad when there was no good to counteract it, and so he devises a plan to replace Metro Man.<br /><br />It backfires.<br /><br />In the process, Megamind learns a slew of life lessons we could have seen coming a mile away (maybe ten miles at that) and the eventual outcome is rather easy to predict (the bad guy NEVER gets the girl...unless you're watching a kid's movie where the bad guy isn't really that `bad') but there is still a lot of fun to be had here.  The laughs come rather fluidly and the repartee between the characters is fun to watch.  Brad Pitt sounds like a here, Will Ferrell sounds like a dimwitted villain and Jonah Hill is just, well, hilarious.  It looks sharp and it delivers thrills, but never in a way that would startle or scare a kid.  This is a battle between good and evil that you don't need to be scared to show the youngsters.tch.

I would have liked maybe a few more tracks with more variety, but the Asian inspired music fits well here.   all in all a worthy purchase.

B0053TMP24|5.0|EDIT: Updated to 5 stars now that Amazon has released a typo-free version of this book. =)<br /><br />I really can't add too much to this review that hasn't been already said by others. This is a great book, hands down. I love the Percy Jackson series, and am finding the Heroes of Olympus stories to be just as riveting.<br /><br />My biggest gripe - and the reason I'm giving this book only 3 stars - is that the first edition of this book for the Kindle is absolutely fraught with typos. Most of these typos are of a careless nature. I'm not sure if this was a problem on behalf of the author or his editor, but I really did expect better.<br /><br />At $10 for an intangible purchase, I would expect that this document should be typo-free.<br /><br />It is not. It is the most glaring example of poor editing of all the Kindle books I have purchased (My Kindle library stands at just about 80 books now.)<br /><br />I will happily amend this review to 4 or 5 stars if Amazon will send an updated copy with all the typos fixed.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|adds new options for those who take as many pictues with your phone as i do. and it also allows for manipulation of pictures already in your gallery. overall just a fun/useful app to play with. highly recommended!
B005LBN7WQ|5.0|I pre-ordered this knowing that there will only be one new single on the CD (\\"Lighthouse\\" co-written by John Shanks and Gary Barlow) IT'S RIDICULOUS FOR PEOPLE TO POST A LOW RATING ON A PRODUCT THEY HAVEN'T PURCHASED. Customers want to know about the actual merchandise, not your personal bias. Don't use Amazon to rant like an immature idiot on something that you haven't purchased. I hope Amazon removes the review I'm speaking of. Since this is a Greatest Hits CD, and I own most of their CD's, I can give a FAIR opinion. Yes, Westlife does many covers, but they do them beautifully. It's their AMAZING vocals that have sold millions of cd's worldwide, and I am buying this CD because I wanted to have all of their \\"greatest hits\\" on one CD. Plus, the new single \\"Lighthouse\\" is awesome imo.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|From the moment this cd starts playing, the funky blues rock starts. Absolutely love it!! All the great reviews this receives are well deserved. Even though it's titled 'Brothers', it's mostly about man/woman lovin.  It's a sexy, funky, fun, rocking album that I've been playing every day after work to completely change the mood & let the good times begin. It's become one of my fave cd's.   And with 15 songs at 55 minutes, it's well worth buying. You'll love it, your friends will love it & so will the neighbours :)
B001E45XT4|5.0|So, I was a bit weary when I saw this headset. I saw the price and immediately thought, \\"Well this is gonna be a useless piece of junk!\\" I still ended up buying it in the end though, and I do not regret it at all! Its sound quality is really great! I don't know how to really describe it since I'm no musician, but all the music I play sounds amazing in this headset! The ease of use has to get a 5 star rating, how could you mess up with this? You plug it in its respective slots (Derp!). The bass response is OUTSTANDING! Grenades exploding behind you and gunshots going off are realistic sounding with the bass this delivers. I also listen to lots of Dubstep, and the bass in those songs are rich, deep and thumping. The mic quality is what I really bought it for though! I wanted to do Minecraft let's plays and this mic is pristine! It's loud and clear with pretty good noise cancelling. Just make sure that if you have static fuzz in your voice recordings that you buy an external sound card or plug the mic into your other inputs! I thought my mic was static-y, but it was just my silly sound card. The only SLIGHT downside is the tightness of the headset. It's a bit tight, but with the padding (Which is so soft and cushion-y!) and some getting used to, it's nothing to gripe over when everything else is so good. Plus, who can take off for that when the headset is so low cost!

I have two things. there is a bug sometimes when you're making a secondary Laser i've of the primary, laser colors will also become a color when rotating other lasers that happen to intersect into that prism. it becomes movable as well.  secondly,  and this is minor, is a lower score better or worse?  it's never made clear.  awesome game nine the less, hope there us a sequel to keep my mind a 'thinkin'.

B0053TMP24|4.0|Riordan rocks! Riordan's pacing beats with the dependability of a hero's heart. How cool is that? But, definitely- read these books in order. I also love that Riordan writes with such reliable authority on interesting subjects that grip readers of all ages.<br />But, kindle- come on, this formatting was terrible. Riordan (and your paying customers) deserve better. The oddly spaced spelling was distracting and destroys your credibility as a viable option to owning a paper copy of a book we paid good money for. It also ripped us out of Riordan's writing. We all deserve better.
0071762345|5.0|I recently purchased three books on social media from Amazon, and this is by far the best. My copy is now full of dog-eared pages that I've already begun to revisit. This is a great starting point for someone interested in social media strategy. It's also a delightful, engaging read. The tables, figures, action items, illustrative examples and succinct summaries keep the pace upbeat and the information easy to digest. From here on out, it's my go-to social media companion. Thanks Dave Kerpen!

B001S86J5S|5.0|This movie is an all time favorite of my brother and i, i found it in Amazon and bought it. Great movie, funny and entertaining, Chan shows it's best in this movie.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This movie is really great if you have never read the book. I would highly suggest watching this first, as the book makes this seem like just another good football movie. Of course that doesn't seem like much of a bad thing, but if you decide to step foot into the realm of true realistic ridiculousness (depression, racism, abuse, love/hate, oil, vicariousness, small town bs, etc), the book will tell a whole different story. Maybe I should just write a review on the dang book! :D<br /><br />This movie really is a good one and a very very true story... down to nearly every word spoken. Buy it, read it, live it, love it, and welcome to the soul and heart of small town Texas... Friday night football.<br /><br />If you do not find this review helpful, please comment as to why. Thank you!
B0059DL0UC|4.0|This is a good book to refer to when you are trying to be sure you are focusing your Pilates exercises toward the right muscle group.  Very thorough and informative.
B005OUARUO|5.0|My favorite is The Circle Married the Line.  The lyrics, the music, and the vocals are hypnotic.  You can listen to it over and over again and get more out of it each time.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Two issues.  1 Shipping and condition.  Perfect all around. Arrived quickly and was as promised. Thanx.  2.The music on the CD.  I am not going to pretend to tell the reader what is and is not good music.  I bought this for my wife and she loves it. You may not, but at this price, take a chance. It's better than a stick in the eye.
B002VL2PTU|5.0|Watched the movie, but I'm not sure where to start.  What I saw was a man dedicated to performance.  I truly believe it was there within him to always give to his fans.  It was important to him because I believe he felt them.  I really wish, looking back, that I could have seen that concert.  Knowing what I do now, I would have gone and seen it (I live in US).  Michael, although misunderstood sometimes, felt the world turning around him.

B004G25V9S|5.0|Honestly it took me about 5 listens and two weeks before I finally understood the melodic direction of this album. At first I was wowed by the memorable melodies of 'The Devils Orchard' and 'I Feel the Dark' but was confused with a lot of the rest. Now after letting the album grow on me it's moments in 'Nepenthe', 'Haxprocess' and 'Marrow of the Earth '(which bares striking resemblance to melodies on Morningrise) that are amongst my favorite Opeth pieces ever. Truly a risk taking album but one that will be remembered fondly in the long run. For all intents and purposes this is another Akerfeldt & Steven Wilson masterpiece. Buy it!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this for my fience and she loves it! She had all the seasons separately in the clear plastic and they fell apart and got scratched. This set she truly loves with the bonus content and they all have a great storage for the disc and good pictures too. It's a must for any Sex and the City fan. Now I'm stuck watching it lol, but I like it.
B000VI70WM|2.0|This album had potential.  I really like some of the songs; \\"Falling Down\\" is probably my favorite.  But other songs, like \\"The Valley\\" could have been excellent if it had been mixed in the traditional Duran Duran fashion.  I've heard it live, and it was fantastic - deep slapping bass, great guitar runs, and pounding drums.  Here it feels anemic.  The bass is barely heard.  Nite Runner just sounds like a Justin Timberlake song.  I could imagine it in his voice.  I like Justin, but when I listen to Duran Duran, I want to hear Duran Duran.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|great product & great price, quick shipping & packaged well. the walking dead is a great show which hooks you in from the first scene. cannot wait for the next season.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|We want the theatrical versions on Blu-Ray!  It doesn't even have to be dedicated, theatrical release-only editions...just include it as a special feature, for example, like was included on the older DVD releases.  I refuse to buy any of these until the original, theatrical releases are included.
B00004SA8A|2.0|I wish I had taken the review by \\"A Customer\\" more seriously before ordering this 7-CD set of Shubert's Piano Sonatas performed by Wilhelm Kempff. Several of the CDs in the set I received have serious flaws both in sound quality and the technical recording itself. I have a good stereo system, not a boom box, and I bought the set from amazon.com not some Chinese knock-off.  The pianist is fantastic; I am very disappointed in the technical production of this set.  I am returning the set to amazon.com for a full refund.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I thought this book was amazing and was surprised to see how it quick it flowed compared to the last book The Lost Hero and really enjoyed reading this book and thought how much detail he put in and I feel like I'm seeing all of this in my head and can't wait for the next book and hope that it will be great as this and I recommend this book to any Percy Jackson Fans without hesitation!!!!!!!!!!  It also helps if you had read the series Percy Jackson & The Olympians Series first before The Heroes of Olympus Series).
1439192812|5.0|I purchased the book more for my children than myself, but I have found myself lost in the pages. My children are 4 and 5, but I was able to take parts of the book, simplify the words and start small discussions about stars, earthquakes and magic. My children will 'grow into' the book, but for now I am enjoying learning things that I didn't even know.   I would definitely recommend this book for children who are middle school age, it has a lot of great information, but some bigger words. Younger children are going to need an adults help picking the book apart. I am really glad I purchased this book, I know it will serve me as I raise my freethinking children.
0316044938|5.0|I recently caught Peter Jackson's film version of Alice Sebold's novel and it made me think twice.  I remember first reading the book years ago and being captivated and touched.  In fact, I recommended it to everyone I knew.  But after watching the movie, I started questioning my original thought.  I thought maybe my original viewpoint of The Lovely Bones was due to being young...and now that I'm older and jaded, perhaps I'd find the book too melodramatic.  Well, I didn't.  It's as beautiful, heartbreaking, and touching as I remember.  Sebold pulls you in from go with her beautiful prose and wonderful characters.  The journey of both Susie in heaven and her family on Earth are so wonderfully juxtaposed, it made me remember why it would be so hard to make a movie out of this book in the first place.  I won't blame Peter Jackson for his effort, this book is impossible to boil down to a two hour movie.  But for those who have only seen the movie and are ready to write off the book, please think twice.  There's a reason there was so much buzz behind this story and a reason that a director of such stature decided to give it a shot.    There are honestly not many books better than this one and I'm very glad i revisited it.
B004JYU7FG|5.0|Great Album, if you love Motorhead you will not be disappointed. Still has that classic sound any Motorhead fan loves.
0689878451|5.0|I bought this book for Banned Book Week. I read it to my 4 and 5 year old daughters and they really loved the penguins. They were able to understand that animals have families too and that not all families are the same. They loved hearing about how the two boy penguins wanted an egg of their own. I loved how simple and beautiful the story is. I would recommend this story to any family wanting to teach acceptance to their children.<br /><br />I am a heterosexual, married mother and I didn't feel like this book pushed any kind of agenda, it's a sweet story. It's still true, even if Silo and Roy are no longer together. And even though it's not written in eloquent iambic pentameter, I believe that they way you read it ultimately defines the tone of any book.<br /><br />It never uses the word gay, or the term LGBT or even says homosexual... it's just about two boy penguins who chose each other and wanted an egg.  Same sex pairings happen in the animal kingdom, and I think this book does justice to the fact that not only do animals often group into families, but that sometimes they aren't what humans consider 'traditional'.<br /><br />This book didn't make my children gay or indoctrinate them as I was already teaching them to be accepting of others.
1423140591|5.0|After The Lost Hero, I was pretty skeptical about this seires. I liked Percy WAY better than Jason. I mean, in The Lost Hero, they were all like \\"ohh, your so awesome Jason, even though you can't even remeber what you did, while we all plainly know that Percy defeted Kronos. But youre still SO awesome!\\" When I learned that The Son Of Neptune was going to be about Percy, I litarly started jumping up and down in anticipation.<br />  The Son of Neptune was a great read, although there could of been more action on Percy's part. This book was also very halarious. I qoute, (Percy just summoned a wave, drowning the ghosts. However, the wave also knocked him off the tall glacier, and into the water.)Frank \\"Percy just sacreficed himself to save us. No, I won't belive he is dead.\\"-I just wanted to say that they are underestimating him hugley, as you will soon find out-(After Frank and Hazel defeat the giant)\\"We found Percy waiting for us by the glacier, and will you belive it? He actually looked kind of mad!\\"\\"Are you okay? That was a huge fall!\\" Percy \\"Oh, you mean off the glaceir? I jumped twice that distance off the St Louis Arch.\\" Frank and Hazel \\"What?!\\" Percy,\\"Long story. Tell you guys later.\\"<br />  About the characters, I think Riordan does a great job creating diverstiy. Frank is a big clumsy boy,*Spoiler* whos life depeneds on a peice of wood.*end*The only thing he is good at is archery, and he hopes Apollo will claim him. However, he turns out to be a son of Mars(Ares).<br />  Hazel is a curesed girl who should be dead. She can find any gems, or valuble metals around her. Actually, the gems are attracted to her. But, whoever accepts the valubles will be given very bad luck.<br />  Between Percy and Jason,I think you know who I like best. I am not trying to be prejudiced, but its the fact that I was with Percy for 5 books, where he did all this amazing stuff. Then this guy pops up out of nowhere, and sudenly he is the most amazing guy on the universe. Don't get me wrong- I love Jason- but I wish that Jason's \\" Im so popular and awesome and everyone loves me\\" aura could have been a little bit more subtle. The best thing I liked about this story was that while Jason couldnt remeber anything about his past, Percy woke up with like 1/6 of his memory already there. And while Jason couldnt remeber any of his memorys until Hera gave them back to him, Percy almost got everything back in the middle of his quest. In fact, he woke up with one word on his mind: Annabeth. Cutest thing ever, right?<br />  Overall, I loved reading this book. At first, I thought it would be the same thing as The Lost Hero, only swapping out Jason for Percy. I assure you that is far from the truth.on- but I wish that Jason's \\" Im so popular and awesome and everyone loves me\\" aura could have been a little bit more subtle.

B005EXA8XC|5.0|Before I begin reviewing, yes there is some major sync errors on the BLU-RAY version of this show, NOT the DVD, so for those wondering, the DVD looks and sounds amazing. As for the bonus 4 Nevermind promo vids, unfortunately are not on the stand-alone release of this show, which is kind of baffling but only means a market ploy by the companies. Anyways, on to the review..<br /><br />This show is absolutely great! Filmed on Halloween at the Paramount Theater in Seattle 1991, this show is a great example of Nirvana's intensity live, right on the brink of exploding. Nevermind had only been released a little more than a month after this show was filmed, but you can almost sense the sound of revolution this band and this genre was about to make on the music world. In some ways, this show displays some intimate moments, one being a hometown show and that the band was still in the somewhat early stage of their short years as a band. Songs like Floyd the Barber and Love Buzz are great somewhat nostalgic trips, while Breed and 'Teen Spirit usher in what would be a tidal wave of genre-defining rock. The video presentation is excellent, you can choose wide or full screen, and the sound is a great 5.1 surround sound. As for the CD version, unlike the Reading Festival, is not as heavily edited down, so if you do spring for the may I say, excellent box set, it is a great addition. Overall, this is a great show if you're a Nirvana long-time fan or just novice looking into the group and why they are still being praised today, this show surely shows why.<br /><br />On a side note, if you're a Blu-ray loyalist, I would wait until the issue is taken care of before purchasing it, which I feel it will be soon enough if enough fans speak up. It'll be worth the wait.
0786715103|5.0|One of the most detailed eye-witness accounts of the 1994 Rwanda genocide ever published. Lt. Gen. Dallaire was in a unique position to observe the cowardice and hypocrisy of the international community, the equivocation of the genocide's architects, and the shear magnitude of human brutality and suffering.
B0000025HG|5.0|As Sophia Petrillo on 'The Golden Girls' might say, \\"Picture it!  1979!  The world is blinded by the Disco ball\\".  And the two most popular and talented pop female singers come together to make history and gold for their respective recording companies.  As the audience shakes to the beat and power of 'Enough is Enough (No More Tears)' (one of the first 'I won't be a victim' songs), Barbra masterfully introduces people who bought the album for the hit song, to what a true talent can do with terrific material.  All the ballads mentioned above are perfect ('Niagara' being my personal favorite - followed very closely by 'After the Rain' [opening the longing we all feel for a lover that makes us feel like that] to the gentle nostalgia of 'Kiss Me in the Rain').  Of course Barbra does wonders with 'Come Rain or Come Shine' (just as her mentor Judy Garland did) and introduces us to a gem such as 'Wet' (very reminiscent of 'Lazy Afternoon').  So dive in (water...get it? :  and treat yourself and hear how a singer performs without the need for a 48-track mixer to fix the mistakes.
B000002GQL|3.0|Definitely not even near their best- Can't touch the first 6. I agree it's sad to listen to because we know they'll never be the same. Pinder's 2 songs and Hayward's 2 are very good, but the rest are throwaways. What makes Moodies music so great is the feeling their songs elicit, and for my it's just not there on this one. ISOLC and AQOB are great, and their two best by far, the others very good, this one just good-the 7th best of the classic 7.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I already have this app from the regular market. I love this app! It has some great effects that make your pictures look very abstract and artistic. For those saying there's no gallery option, this isn't true. It's a button on the camera screen..
B002ZG98FU|5.0|Morning Glory starring Rachel McAdams is a cute and charming comedy. McAdams is perfection in this film, she is the best actress of her generation, she's likeable, refreshing, and you always end up rooting for her character. Diane Keaton, Harrison Ford, and Patrick Wilson also star. I felt Ford kind of seemed out of his league in Morning Glory, I just didn't like his character even though he changed at the end, he's just not a funny actor like Keaton. Keaton is wonderful as always and loved her chemistry with McAdams. Morning Glory is fun and full of energy, check it out!

0307476154|5.0|Overall - This is a great read. Usually in a Trilogy - book #2 is not as good as the first or third - however, I thought it was Excellent. I would highly recommend this book and the entire series.
B005CK76ZA|1.0|this nirvana set was a super let down, the boombox tracks are garbage, cool for a one time listen, other than that though, well not so much. the vig mixes were a let down as well, not hard to tell why they had it remixed before releasing it, and the remaster of the original actually hurt my ears, quailty control got away form somebody on this one. And the blu ray was out of snyc, i feel like i wasted over two hundred bucks on the whole set, bummer.

B001DDBCUA|5.0|I never saw the actual series on HBO; the edited versions are more to my taste and sensibilities but still enjoyed the movie.  Take the bad with the good - the sex is graphic but otherwise I really love the fashion and the story, and most of all - the girls' friendship.
0062060554|2.0|The author repeats herself so many times throughout this book it drove me mad! Even the end was disapointing. It was a very interesting concept that could have been taken in a million different directions. But instead was taken on the road most traveled. Disapointing.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I had never heard of the story of Hachiko.  So, one day I was looking on demand for a movie to watch.  I am a dog lover (I have 4 Maltese Dogs).  I stumbled on the title Hacki: A Dogs tale.  But, then something came up and couldn't watch it.  That night my husband had the television on and this particular movie was starting.  OMG! we watched (usually my husband falls asleep watching any movie that is not action-packed, needles to say he was wide awake). The story is so moving, well made and, acted by both actors and dogs.  I couldnot stop crying I didn't cry when parker (Richard Gere died, shock was more the case).  So, my husband and I were like whats gonna happen to hachi.  Well the dog going back to the train station every evening at the same time and, not wanting to stay with anyone, living on the train tracks just waiting for that train to come in and, the musical score just broke our hearts.  My husband who never cies,only when his mother passed away and our dog died, and myself were a mess.  When 10 years later Parkers wife goes to the cemetary to visit her husbsnds grave site and, upon heading back to the train station stumbles upon hachi I sobbed liked a baby.  Seeing hachi walk slowly and look dirty just tore into my soul.  The final scene is both sad (hachi's last walk to the train station) and, his owner, friend taking him home (heaven) was so moving I couldnot get that scene out of my mind.  I creid myself to sleep.  I immediately went on Amazon.com and bought the movie.  I have told everyone I know about this movie.  My grown kids 29, (female) and 21 (male) watched (I have never seen them cry, only when they were young) were crying like two kids. And, I cried all-over agin.  LOVE YOU HACHI!!!!
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I've known about the High School of the Dead Manga since I was in High School.  I never read it though other than a quick summary of the story.  I thought it sounded interesting but I never followed up on it.  Just a few months ago I saw the entire show and was amazed at how good the story is.<br /><br />First off let me say that yes, the circumstances are ridiculous (2 average dudes traveling with 4 INSANELY hot babes) but isn't that every high school kids fantasy?  A zombie apocalypse where the women outnumber the men in the group and they all fight over you?  Sounds good to me.<br /><br />The only bad thing I have to say about this show is the amount of \\"fan service\\" that is displayed.  We get far too MANY shots of boobs jiggling, panty shots, and stupid situations in which boobs are somehow the focus.  If they had been more subtle with that then this show would have been perfect.<br /><br />In one of the episodes you have the 2 main guys in one room talking about guns and loading them up, while the 4 girls are in the bathroom bathing together and grabbing each others tits.  Then they walk around the apartment either naked, or wearing nothing but an apron while acting VERY horny and stoned trying to hit on the main character.  He of course is shocked like very other damn anime character is in these shows and denies their advances, opting to tuck them into bed so that he can go snipe out some zombies.<br /><br />I realize this defines a lot of male fantasies but it's done in such a blatant way that I can't help but shake my head and blush when I watch this.<br /><br />As far as the characters go I think they are well developed.  The main guy is your average slacker with hidden potential that most of the girls want when the shiz hits the fan.  The second dude is you typical fat geek who happens to be obsessed with guns and is an expert in their use.  He's probably the most useful character in battle.  The 4 women are: The ditsy nurse with the ENORMOUS rack.  She's the only adult in the group.  Then there's the main girl, she's basically the main love interest of the main character, she's hot, well balanced, has drama...etc.  The third girl is the red/pink headed smart rich girl of the group.  She seems to be a potential love interest for the fat gun nerd.  And finally the fourth girl is the samurai girl, who is the best hand to hand combat character in the group.  She's the most serious of all the females and is probably in competition with the main girl for the main guys man juices.<br /><br />The characters are fun and the show is entertaining.  A fine addition to the ever growing zombie culture.<br /><br />I rate this show 5 stars despite the embarrassing fan service.  If you like zombies, guns, hot anime girls, and drama then you will like this show.the only adult in the group.

B005POK858|2.0|The game plays very well, I haven't been able to play much of it as of yet, but I have encountered a bug that may prevent me from playing at all. The game will not suspend properly when pushed into the background and will cause my phone to overheat. Going to the home screen or receiving a call will cause this which is quite inconvenient, especially as it cooks your ear (Samsung Fascinate). Also, It lacks the beautiful touch screen control mode of its predecessor.<br />The battle system is your standard RPG fare (attack/item/magic/etc...), but with a nifty auto button that will just go on attacking unto the enemy is dead.<br />I cannot speak for the story as of yet, but the opening history and dialog lay a nice ground work and it does have me interested.
0062060554|4.0|I laid down in bed a few nights ago with this novel and it was an easy read; a few hours later the story was finished and, as it always goes for me, was pondered upon the next day.  Upon purchasing this book, I thought, \\"hmm... a suspenseful 50 First Dates!  How tacky!\\" but I typically trust my fellow Amazon reviewers.<br /><br />In the end, I will still recommend this book, but my advice is to not dwell on it much the next day.  A few things bother me, including the lack of scientific backing behind the mental condition at the end of the story.  Slightly hard to believe for me.  Things to go from crappy to...  well, you know.  Rome wasn't built in a day but some worlds are fixed in one.  Who knew?<br /><br />Perhaps my other aggravation with the book is the authors lack of portraying the female protagonists views in a way that makes you not want to hit her.  I'm indecisive, but come on.  I love him, I don't, I love him, I don't, it says I shouldn't love him and that's good because I don't, but perhaps my moral obligation is to love him even though I have all this evidence that I shouldn't.  Bahhh!  I mean, yeah, true, she has every kind of amnesia known to man, but please leave out the womanly mushy flip flop (being a female I feel I have the right to say that).<br /><br />In the end, I do recommend this book, and I did enjoy it, despite my two negative thoughts.  It won't be a life long remembrance, but it's an entertaining read on a chilly night.
B0041KKYH4|3.0|Short attention span summary:<br /><br />1. Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a teacher with a mission<br />2. Unfortunately, her mission does not involve the well-being of her students, and instead of A's, she's focusing on getting a pair of double-D's across her chest.<br />3. Having had her meal ticket relationship deep-sixed, she sets her sights on the nerdy but wealthy new teacher (Justin Timberlake in full geek gear)<br />4. The gym teacher (Jason Segel) would like to show her his rope collection, but she thinks that he's rather limp.<br />5. Many R-rated, illegal and immoral shenanigans later, the movie ends without a moral, or a lasting impression.<br />6. Teachers may have been harmed during the making of this movie.<br /><br />This is an adult comedy that should in no way be interpreted as having any connection with real life teaching situations.  Cameron Diaz is extremely convincing with her bad self, strutting around half-stoned in her Louboutins, and Justin Timberlake sends $exy all the way back to the dark ages.  Jason Segel's character is, in fact, rather limp, but well portrayed given his limited screen time.<br /><br />Funny in many ways, not so funny in others, this movie makes no excuses for bad behaviour by educators, and by the end actually condones it.  However, it should be noted that this movie comes with quite a few laugh out loud moments, and the casting of Timberlake in a role like this is so bad that it's hilarious.<br /><br />Here's hoping that you never meet a teacher like Ms. Halsey.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 7, 2011
B001TKKAH8|5.0|I rate this as the best lyrical album i've ever heard.  Besides that the melodies are wonderful as well as the minimal accompanying music and John Simon's production is fantastic.  This is simply one of the best albums I've listened to particularly for those times when you want to be moved and intrigued and involved with the artist.

If you like grimy East Coast, New York hip-hop, this is for you.  that being said, JUST BECAUSE YOU MIGHT CONSIDER 2PAC A BETTER RAPPER DOES NOT MEAN THAT THIS A BAD ALBUM.  There are still some dumb people out there and on this website that are trying to do the whole Big VS Pac thing, trying to keep a 16 year old beef alive. Get over it. They are two completely different rappers with completely different styles and the skill of one does not equal the lack of skill for the other. I, for one, admire both. I prefer Biggie, but I would never knock 2Pac.  Also, yes, Biggie sold crack. He profited off of addicts. If you can't detach the man's actions from his music and just vibe to it, then you probably shouldn't be listening to hip-hop at all because a good percentage of rappers come from similar roots. In other words, why the heck are you reviewing hip-hop albums on amazon?  Oh, and another thing. Yes, Biggie only put out two albums. That's because he GOT SHOT right before the second one came out. Granted, he didn't exactly take steps to avoid getting shot, such as dropping his beef with 2Pac. But nobody will ever know if he would have continued being great or ended up being garbage because all we have to go on is two albums and a handful of other recordings.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I am loving this app! Now I have read some reviews that said there are better apps that do the sane thing out there, and maybe thats true, I haven't done the research. But, what is not true are people's complaints about not being able to apply effects to existing pics. This are just people who didn't take time to play around with the app. The option is there, not obvious, but there. Just hit the three green lines icon. I had to do it twice, both times out did a media scan. On the third time, it opens up the pics on your phone. choose the effect, click the download icon. Ta da. Also what's not true is the inability to share the pics. I sent them to someone who did not have the app abd was able to see the effect on the pic. Also shows up on the comp, and is printable. So, all that...and it's free. So, worth the try. :)
B004DP9QFS|2.0|It does everything it says it does, but seems very limited for what you pay.  I wish I had used the \\"test-drive\\" feature before buying.  At least it was purchased with an app-store credit and not real money.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I must admit, I was a bit skeptical about what this app said it can do. However, I am now a believer! This camera app essentially is a filter that converts a standard looking picture to look like an animated cell, like what Richard Linklater did with Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly. Also, you can reconvert already taken pics saved to the phone or tablet. Lots of fun!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|haha I just bought this about a month ago on the android marketplace. it was the first app I've ever bought, and I don't regret it, I love it. amazing effects, awesome pictures, easy to use, well worth the money. be glad it's free today!
B004X4R3FE|5.0|5 stars. thats all my review is going to be. do not miss this movie. its was an excellently acted movie. phenominal scenes. love the period and the story. watch it!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Love this app! It adds nice portrayals of what I have always been wanting to draw!(I suck at drawing) $
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|\\"The Lost Symbol\\" did one thing well for me: It aroused my curiosity and interest around the ancient mysteries of this world, the lines where science and mysticism may intersect someday and shed light on all that remains unknown to man from the lost wisdom of the ages. Also, the thrill of thinking about unimaginable secrets lost in the pages of history intrigue us all and this story draws us into that world and attempts to build our hope and imagination on finding these answers, be it in Washington DC or any another corner of the world, location is inconsequential to the large purpose which Brown pursues in his latest novel.<br /><br />My favorites of Dan Brown are - as obvious as this may - The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons. Brilliantly written with irresistible plots.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story; I wasn't fascinated or thrilled or in love. I simply enjoyed a good read and invested the time to finish reading what I had started because I had enough curiosity to know the ending.<br /><br />Brown takes more than his fair share of beating on 2800+ Amazon reviews so I will close with this inspiring note after watching his interview video on Amazon: I admire that Dan Brown wakes up at 4am every day and locks himself up in a small cottage shut off to the outside world and far away from all human contact, equipped only with a refrigerator and a computer for typing; there he slips into a trance where he can write, create, and produce for hours on end. It is the best example to focused intensity and self-discipline, all of which I try to constantly pursue in my own endeavors. It is important to genuinely like the people behind the work and like and respect I have in great volume for Dan Brown.<br /><br />So thank you Dan Brown and I hope the next one exceeds all of our expectations.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love it! Insight into the differences of Roman Myth Vs. Greek seem to be a whole lot more involved that I originally thought. I loved the original Percy Jackson series, loved the first book of this series. He does a great job of adding interest to new characters as well as seeing new thinking with the original characters as well.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I loved Little Women, and I am actually surprised that I did.<br /><br />There is something alluring and engaging when the first chapter of a novel starts in a cold winter. My own temperament is neither made nor able to be trained for cold weather. I shiver even in a mild wind sometimes and yet I crave reading about my characters bravely battling a brutally cold winter, especially when the setting takes us to Concord, Massachusetts in late 19th century civil-war era America. Harsh and gloomy as the weather may be, the bleak of winter is no match for the warmth which stems from love, happiness, and tightness of the March family. Four sisters, one mother, one nanny, and a father at war, Alcott introduces us one by one to the March sisters and the bond of sisterhood which is tested, broken and mended again and again throughout the novel.<br /><br />The theme and plot of this novel paint the pictures from every day life for an ordinary family caught in, yes you guessed it, extraordinary times. The hardships of Civil War and near-poverty, while real for the March family, are not central to the plot and so \\"Little Women\\", which has many important messages, comes across as extremely light, fun and beautiful reading. Even if it's considered a children's classic, I shamelessly admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />My most favorite character, of course, is the one and only Jo who shows us....<br /><br />...that short temper can bring about only regrets and how to channel that energy to good use.<br />...that we need to deal with the loss of a loved one and the abandon friendships at times.<br />...that we can create magic if we write from the heart.<br />...that maternal love can afford us more comfort than any other imaginable in good and especially in desperate times.<br />...that age difference and cultural gaps are no strike against a love story.<br /><br />Oh I loved Little Women! So happy to have read it. Pick up this classic TO-DAY!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|love this app.  my world is complete!  pics come out expected. downer..no flash or zoom.  no videos either. other than that this app works great.  would love to shoot with other options. like speed shot or panoramic shots!
0156027321|5.0|This was one of the best gifts - thank you my friend for giving me this book. I devoured it.<br /><br />First, the part where I was not entirely thrilled with Yann Martel: I came close to referring to the author as what they call an unreliable narrator (I felt this way about one other story: Sophie's World.) He sets up the story first by telling us how he went to meet the hero of his book, and was inspired by such an incredible tale, and if you know nothing else you simply assume this is a true story. In the first few chapters, he even inserts paragraphs set in \\"present time\\" where he describes working sessions with the hero of his story.<br /><br />Shame on him for making all of this up! I felt betrayed by Yann Martel. This was purely a work of fiction, albeit a magnificent one and I wish he were more honest and upfront about it.<br /><br />No matter, still a 5 star review. I loved this book through and through. More than anything, this is a tale of faith and belief and while reason plays a fundamental role in every aspect of Pi's survival, it is faith that keeps him alive. Without reason, he would have suffered more and been even more uncomfortable in his ordeal, but without his faith, well, he would have simply been lost a long time ago.<br /><br />I loved the unison of all religions and the way he embraced his destiny and his suffering. It will stay with me forever. I highly recommend you reading this book.
B003YOXIVW|5.0|If this CD isn't in your music library, it should be.  This is an EXCELLENT CD and the value from Amazon is great!  If you like Peter Gabriel, buy this CD!!!!
0240808452|5.0|[[ASIN:0240808452 Force: Dynamic Life Drawing for Animators, Second Edition]]Not surprised to find a lot of happy reviews on this one. A must for anyone who wants to draw the human figure, definitely not just animators. This is the most exciting book I have purchased and it leaves for dead all the dull anatomy drawing we did in classes. The text, too, is actually worth reading, kept to a minimum and valid. Love this book!
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Talk about a child prodigy! It's gotta be something in the water in New Orleans. Look at the talented Marsalis Family with two generations of jazz legends. Then look at the Nevilles. Same thing. Now it's the Andrews family. There's Glen - who started the Rebirth Bass Band and Troy - yep, you know him best as \\"Trombone Shorty\\" .The guy turned 30 this year but he's been playing since he was SIX YEARS OLD!<br /><br />I've loved his previous albums and got to see him at this year's Philly Folk Fest. Folk Fest? Just two weeks after he headlined the Newport JAZZ Fest? Is this guy versatile or what? Not only did he do an amazing hour - with his band - in Philly; he came back to play along with David Bromberg and his Big Band later that night. Even though there were chairs, no one sat during any of the time Shorty was on stage.<br /><br />This CD shows why the guy is so popular. He is infectious and seeps of NOLa soul. As if he didn't need any more musical support, here he gets periodical help from Lenny Kravitz, Jeff Beck, two of the aforementioned Nevilles and Rebirth (with his brother Glen). Yep Kid Rock is here too, though I can't say I'm a big fan of KR.<br /><br />The CD comes with a booklet of track info and some photos. No real \\"liner notes\\". But, heck - in this case you are here for the music. I've had the CD a week and it's in constant rotation. Not something you want to listen to before bedtime though. You'll be up all night with the music going through your head.<br /><br />Gotta get me some of that New Orleans water they are drinking!<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I laughed out loud when I first opened it. This is a fun app. It is definitely worth the price.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Really cool app. Fun ! I am able to get and use my gallery pics with it. Droid X. 20 w o r d s
B004EPYZZI|5.0|a very uplifting movie for people of all ages. it reminds us that anything is possible if you set your mind to it and also shows us that no matter what there is going on in our lives there is someone overcoming bigger struggles
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Twice now I've played for a couple weeks and it deletes my progress if the phone goes to sleep without pausing the game or something. I loved this game on iPhone, but their android version is too buggy to use.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|This is a very nice camera app. It not only lets you take pictures that look a lot like sketches, watercolors, pastels and comic book artwork, but it displays it in real time so you can use this like an augmented reality app, exploring what your world might look like through different eyes.  The thing to consider, however, is updates and features. For a free app of the day you won't go wrong, but for the two dollar price, I bought this off Google Market because apparently this version does not get updated as frequently. When I bought it, for example, the Market version had the ability to add the effects to a pic on your device, but the older Amazon version was sadly forgotten.  Runs great on my Thunderbolt and Galaxy Tab. For free it's a steal, but if you pay for this I recommend the one that gets updated more frequently.
B001SERO0G|5.0|Amos Oz remembers and shares his early life and much more. All the details, surprises, family life, social context and History itself are rediscovered and savored with total honesty.  Repetition with style and elegance becomes in his hands part of the texture of the book.   The translation from the Hebrew by Nicholas de Lange is first rate. It reads as if the book was originally written in English.  A masterpiece.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Often when I get photo filters, I like the idea of what they can do much better than the application. Most all advertise unique effects that you can use on the go- but require so much adjustment and tinkering beforehand no one would ever actually be able to do it.  Paper camera is different! The effects work and look great on such a huge range of photos. It's also really nice being able to apply the effects to photos in your library. Each filter has a range of adjustments you can make as well, to ensure it looks how you want it to.  Definitely worth a download and test, even if photo filters aren't up your ally.
B0058VW36U|5.0|A tremendous amount of fun at just the right difficulty - hard enough to keep you interested and challenge you, but not so hard that you get stuck and don't want to play anymore. I can't wait for new levels to come out!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Some reviews say that you can't apply the effects to existing photos, but I did that without even trying. If you can't draw, use this to make your own graphic novel. :)
B0052TDGQO|4.0|Like many of the reviews reflect, I greatly enjoyed Scotty on \\"American Idol.\\"  His hometown is about a hour from where I live; and I've spent some time there.  I preordered this set without hesitation.  Then I read the professional review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine who said, \\"And that's all Clear as Day is, no more, no less: professional product released quickly enough that it could still capitalize on a fire that's beginning to smolder down to embers.\\"  I kind of understand his comments.  This set was produced by Mark Bright who has worked with Rascal Flats; and it does fit squarely in the commercial country mold.  Nevertheless, Scotty has a great talent.  \\"Write My Number On Your Hand\\" is my favorite after a few spins of the disc with Scotty's uptempo arrangement, \\"We shared a Coca Cola sitting on a log; and I was waitin' to kiss her like an old bull frog.\\"  I also really like the slower \\"Back on the Ground\\" with Scotty's vocals so sincere, \\"I used to look for every reason in the world to hit that door and she said 'you want another cup of coffee' and I said 'yeah, I'll take one more.'\\"  I remember those years where you couldn't wait to get away from mom & dad and then later when you wish you had more time with them.  Keith Urban's \\"Walk in the Country,\\" \\"Water Tower Town\\" and \\"Dirty Dishes\\" are all great tracks.  At the very least, I think \\"Clear As Day\\" shows a great beginning.  As Scotty matures and takes more control of his music and career, he may put out some classic country that will be played forever like a Patsy Cline record.  This is good.  Enjoy!

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Sammy Hagar is in his early sixties, this is a time when most people start to slow down and think about retirement, but with Chickenfoot III, Hagar sounds anything like someone ready to pack it up! Van Halen is my favorite band of all time and I'm one of the rare fans that actually thought the band became better when Hagar replaced David Lee Roth. To this day, [[ASIN:B000002L99 Van Halen: 5150]] is still my favorite album and it spends a lot of time in my CD player. III is no 5150, but it comes pretty damn close at times. Unlike Chickenfoot's debut album, which for me was a let down, III explodes with one killer track after another. Many others have pointed out, including the band, that they sound like they've been together for years on this album. Originally, III was going to be called IV, which was an inside joke about Chickenfoot being the 4th incarnation of Van Halen sans the Van Halen brothers, but instead they called the album III to describe how far the band has progressed. As Sammy has stated in interviews leading up to the album's release, they're so good on this album that they've skipped their sophmore album and went straight to their third. Plus, it ties in with the 3D packing, which I'll get to in a minute, but first the music...  III has given me hope that straight up killer rock 'n' roll music that I've loved all my life still exists and can be made. This isn't Nu Metal, Electro Pop Rock, Metal Hip-Hop or any other lame rock hybrid that seems to be the only kind of new rock 'n' roll music we get served up these days, this is straight up rock 'n' roll. It's not ironic or pretentious it's just loud and fun music that makes you feel great when you hear it. There are several catchy tracks on III that will have you playing them again and again. \\"Up Next\\" is hands down my favorite track. It rocks with a level of hi-energy and raw power that I haven't heard in years. Chad and Mike lay down a rhythm foundation on this track that will get your foot tapping , your head banging and your heart pounding. Joe's guitar is blisteringly good here and he shines with a killer solo that's the best on the album. Sammy and Mike bring back that signature Van Halen harmony on \\"Up Next\\" that, for me, make it an instant classic! Buy this album for this song alone and you'll be very pleased with your purchase. \\"Big Foot\\" is an all out good time rock 'n' roll song that is sure to be a live favorite. Joe's riff here is easily the best he's come up with on any Chickenfoot album, it's just so catchy and memorable. \\"Dubai Blues\\" is another heavy rocker that features my favorite Hagar vocals on the album. It also has a classic feel to it, actually to me it sounds like it could fit in nicely on [[ASIN:B000002LPD For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge]], it has that kind of era and vibe to it. \\"Different Devil\\" is not only the best ballad on the album, but it may be my favorite Hagar ballad ever! It's so catchy, and again, it features that priceless harmony we get with Hagar and Michael Anthony. Speaking of Michael, III features his best bass playing since [[ASIN:B00004Y6O7 Fair Warning]]. Mike has said in interviews for this album that this is the most freedom he's ever had on any album he's ever worked on, if that's the case then let this man do his thing because he's awesome! You may not catch it on your first listen, but when you listen to these songs again and again, you'll pick up on all the little things that Mike does as a bass player that make him one of the best ever. Chad's drum playing is tight and thunderous. He hammers out some killer grooves on III and like Michael's bass playing, you'll pick up on all these little things that Chad adds to the songs that make them intricate and proves just how important he is to the Chickenfoot sound. Joe is on the top of his game here. He's scaled back the guitar master theatrics (we all know he's an amazing player thanks to albums like [[ASIN:B000RIWAYY Surfing with the Alien Legacy Edition (CD + DVD)]] and [[ASIN:B000002BWD Flying in a Blue Dream]]) and is focusing on grooves and melodies that instantly get stuck in your head. He still proves he's a master of the guitar in his solos, but never goes overboard and plays solos that complement each song, never overshadowing them.   Is III perfect? Unfortunately no. For me, \\"Three and a Half Letters\\", \\"Come Closer\\" and \\"Something Going Wrong\\" failed to connect with me, but the rest of the album is tremendous. If you're a Van Halen fan, a Hagar fan or a fan of great rock 'n' roll in general, then Chickenfoot III belongs in your music collection. I recommend picking up the physical CD for the cool 3D packaging. You'll get a pair of 3D glasses to view the cover, back cover image and 3D bio cards made for each member of the band. 3D album covers are nothing new, but it's still a really cool feature obviously designed to entice those to buy the CD who haven't bought a physical album in several years. Also, I bought my copy at Best Buy which comes with an exclusive bonus DVD of the making of the album.
B0051QO4QY|4.0|Lady Gaga continues to impress with her latest album. I can't get enough of Born This Way, The Edge of Glory, and You and I. She is one of my favorite artists, and I am continually surprised and amazed by what she comes up with!

0385534639|5.0|What an incredible storyteller Erin Morgenstern is.  \\"The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones\\" ~Tsukiko   So much detail and description, without being overbearing...I loved it!  I did not want the book to end. The author made me feel like I was right there in the middle of it all.  I don't think I've ever read anything like this before. Such a unique story and told so well.  I think enchanting is the best way to describe it!  I would love to see this as a movie!!   A new favorite!  I fell in love with the characters and really felt connected to them...not just reading about them
B002VPPS18|5.0|Although there were a pile of these left and right, none with this packaging!<br />it came in perfect.<br />It was such a wonderful gift - I almost kept it! LOL<br />Thank you for the fast shipping!
B0038QGXHW|5.0|Regardless some 1, 2 and 3 stars reviews, I must say this record is very pleasant to hear. And why? Let me explain my points: Haden's bass is a reference for me (since the 60's) and Jarrett doesn't needs any line to be written 'bout him anymore. If you like some \\"soft\\" and soulful music, this CD will be a nice companion for inspirational moments. --BTW, the cover painting is really charming; it is an evidence that a painting does not need colors, curves or anythin' else to be beutiful. If I'm not wrong Miró and Picasso created some great works using just lines... Am I right? Anyway, depending on your taste for pictures you always can buy a 9.99 bucks printing of \\"dogs playing cards and smoking cigars\\"...

0439813786|2.0|I thought The Invention of Hugo Cabret was an interesting concept. While the sheer amount of pictures in it may put a few people off, I kind of liked the idea that it had a visual, almost movie-like feel to it. Besides, it was sort of forewarned in the introduction when it says \\"...picture yourself in the darkness, like the beginning of a movie.\\"<br />I loved that it was based off of a real person, and a real machine. And I like that the author put reference material in the back of the book. The automation is indeed fascinating, and I admit I didn't think much about these machines before reading this. But there are many more like this one, than just what the book talks about, and some of the others are just as intricate and ingenuous.<br /><br />I felt that the book fell a little flat at the end, and that the main plot could've been explored a little more. It seems to me that a lot of the suspense, and greater mystery moments were left aside. But I guess with it being a children's book, target age group being of bedtime reading, the author decided to keep it sweet in its simplicity. With happy endings, and good prevailing over bad, it certainly keeps its childish charm.<br /><br />Overall, my biggest, and I guess, only complaint is that with it being a book for younger children there's a lot of wrongdoing coming from Hugo himself. All throughout the book Hugo lies and steals.<br />In one part Hugo mentions the trait his uncle taught him of stealing, because his uncle had a habit of drinking away the paychecks. Hugo speaks of the guilt he feels at having to steal food to survive. But if he feels bad about stealing, why does he steal toys without any reserve, or remorse? Hugo lies about various things throughout the book as well, telling truths only when his lies no longer have any conviction and his back's against the wall.<br />Isabelle is quite a little thief as well, stealing the key, and she can hold her own when it comes to lying. Though, most her fibs are told out of spite towards Hugo once she figures he's keeping things from her.<br />All of this wouldn't bother me so much, except for the fact that none of this ever has any real repercussions to either one of the children. It's not made clear to them that it's wrong, and they themselves don't think much about their actions.<br /><br />If I were to read this to young children, I feel it would be followed by a post pep talk of the difference between right and wrong.<br /><br />While it kept me amused during the 2 ½ hours it took me to read it, and I enjoyed parts of it, it lost stars for me along the way. I probably won't read it again, and I don't highly recommend buying it. If you have to read it, save your money and get it at the library instead.ce she figures he's keeping things from her.

B003YUU62U|3.0|I purchased my Hover slipons in late May and they are great, comfortable shoes.  I purchased them as an alternative to Sperry's since the salt water seems to eat the seams of topsiders quicker than Sperry's of the 80/90s (I just can't get a pair to last).  The Hovers work wonderfully in the boat and in a commercial kitchen, no slip only grip.  The Bad: I live in the south and crocs make my feet sweat.  Solution: wash them.  The problem is the canvas shrunk.  Eventually it stretched out but not before rubbing a blister on my big toe.  With that being said, I still love, wear, and regularly deodorize my Crocs (don't know if i will wash them again).

0452289963|4.0|I read this cover to cover and could not put it down. I have struggled for 30 years with intense anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. Lately I have been on a spiritual path and this was one of the books that helped me the most. I feel better. Entirely. Being able to see myself and others from above and being able to rise above the collective sickness that plagues us as humans is the most powerful concept if you can live that way.  The only problem I had was his tone is cold and I feel like he leaves out the JOY that is humanity. He mentions joy, enthusiasm and excitement, but in my opinion he totally discounts LOVE and connection with people. Isn't that the whole point of being here? Love! Joy! Connection! Talking of never being truly in love or connected with people really saddened me, but the rest of the book is so helpful I can find other teachings to bring more love and peace into my life now that the negative is gone. I really recommend \\"Personal Power through Awareness\\" by Sanaya Roman. Similar concepts but so uplifting.

B0018STVHQ|3.0|So I'm not a historian.  And as such I don't really notice the historical inaccuracies in this movie or in the book its based off of.  That being said, I did notice how much they changed the movie from the book, which was rather irritating.<br /><br />The Boleyn family has long been favorites at court.  So when little Mary Boleyn, newly married, attracts the eye of the King, she is forced to play his mistress but falls in love while doing so.  But he is easily distracted and while she lays in childbed, her sister Anne becomes his new favorite.  But Anne isn't content to merely be a mistress, she wants to be Queen.  She'll push King Henry to the limit for his desires and plays a dangerous game while doing so.  Mary, and her brother George, are also caught up in Anne's plan as these three Boleyns seek ambition far above them.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Natalie Portman: Anne Boleyn<br />Scarlett Johannson: Mary Boleyn<br />Eric Bana: Henry VIII<br />Jim Sturgess: George Boleyn<br /><br />I think that most of the characters were well cast in this film.  Portman and Johannson were great as the Boleyn sisters and even did the sibling rivalry thing quite well.  I'm used to Johannson in tougher roles so to see her a bit meeker in this role as Mary was unusual for me.  But she still played it well.  Their brother George, while a big part in the book, had a smaller role in the movie, but I thought Jim Sturgess did a good job of making him the light hearted sibling.  The only character I really have a complaint about is Eric Bana as Henry.  His acting was ok, but Henry was always described as a Golden King and Prince.  Eric Bana is dark haired and not very jovial.  In other words, he wasn't King Henry VIII.<br /><br />As stated before the movie only partially followed the book.  They left out quite a few important details and I don't think it did them any favors.  I do realize that the passage of time that happens in the book couldn't happen in the movie, but that also kind of ruined things for me too since the timeline was too rushed.  The actual movie was shot well and the scenery was very nice.  I was impressed by the settings of the castles and inside the castles as it seemed very authentic.  The music was ok, but nothing that really made you stand up and take notice which is just as well since this is more of a drama than any other type of movie.<br /><br />I do have to make mention of a few scenes in this book because those viewers with a weaker constitution may not find them appropriate.  While no naughty bits are actually shown, there are a couple of sex scenes and a rape scene within this movie.  Consider yourself warned if you can't stand such things.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad movie but it could have been much improved on.  If they make another one of Gregory's books into a movie I just may check it out.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011shed.  The actual movie was shot well and the scenery was very nice.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|I've loved Fringe from the very first episode.  I personally believe that it is the best Sci-Fi TV Series ever. And that's saying a lot, since I absolutely loved Lost. I've also purchased Season 1, and Season 2 of Fringe on DVD.  Highly recommended!

B000AGTPUK|5.0|I and a friend went to see this movie when it first came out. We are both over 60 but our hearts are young.  The theater was jam packed every seat taken. The thing that jogs and amazes my memory about the experience is this. I would have to say the audience was 80% children and young at that. But in amazement during this movie at least to a point you could hear a pen drop. And that point is when they reached the north pole, only then could you hear some murmuring. That memory of how entranced everyone was will always stick with me. I just wish though that they had not released this movie to dvd. This movie is so good I wish they would just re show it every year at the movie houses for everyone to enjoy again. And yes I believe and always will.  Ok now we fast forward to 2011, my old standard tv went out and it would cost $300 to fix. Hmm. So its merry christmas to me , new flat screen 47\\" LG 3d. So now Im reading all the horror stories about the 3d versions of polar express done in 05 08 so I take a chance and get the updated 2010 of this 3d movie the one that shows the train on the ice on the cover.  I still rate it as 5* for the 3d. Of course the most prominent 3d effect is when the train stops on emergency and nose comes out in your lap. But for the kind of movie this is the 3d effects are quite satisfying. In a great portion of the movie faces bedposts etc are extended or appear to be beyond the screen. Also there are moments of snow falling in your living room just like happened at the theater. Most 3d movies will say to sit 2meters/6ft from the screen to get the full effects. 3d is one tv effect in which it pays to sit close. Get this version [2010] if good 3d is what you want and you wont be disappointed. I have watched this 3d version several times now and each time seems to get even better.

193413712X|5.0|The only reason I picked this book was because it won the Pulitzer.  While the book may be short in length, it is dense.  The imagery and language used in this story is well done and really moves the story along. However, the lack of punctuation throughout made it somewhat troublesome at times to discern who was speaking. Was it the protagonist or his father? Or his grandfather?  Irrespective of this; the story about one man's recollections of his and other lives filled with joy and lament goes far and wide in exploring the experiences one has but rarely takes note as one is too busy either watching the clock, if you will, or not using one's time to one's advantage.

0812973992|2.0|Using the Vietnam War and the Twin Towers as crutches for this story wasn't a bad choice. The plot revolving around several characters of whom are all connected by a common experience isn't really a plot at all.  This story is really several stories of multiple characters who exist at different levels in society. And that's it; they just exist.  I am at a loss with respect to this author's intent regarding his reason for writing a story about hookers, a religious fanatic and his brother, a failed artist and a widow who has also lost her son as well as another woman who adopts two children who were the hooker's kids. The stories of each character, while interesting, don't deliver any insight or depth about the overall theme of this novel.  Was it destitution, hopelessness, resentment, loss, hope, faith, indifference? I still can't figure it out.  While the author has some talent in his voice, I can't say this novel deserved to come close to an award yet alone receive it.  What were the other finalists? Sometimes I think the fix is in as I have made attempts to read other \\"award winners\\", but didn't even bother to write a review as they went into the donate pile.  Like the let down at the end of the movie \\"Up in the Air\\", this book disappointed.
0143118757|5.0|After reading Roger Dawson's \\"Secrets of Power Negotiating\\" (another outstanding book, by the way), I did not expect to learn much new material from this book. I was wrong -  \\"Getting to Yes\\" offers a new approach to negotiating. As the authors point out, we negotiate constantly in our daily lives. Most of us are unaware of the times we negotiate with our friends, coworkers, and family. What this book teaches readers is to how to go about resolving conflicts in an unemotional and logical way. Much of the advice here is given in the context of negotiating, but interestingly it could have easily been positioned as a book on influence. The material here reminded me of Dale Carnegies' \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" (also a brilliant book).   I don't think that people should just read this book to get an advantage in negotiating. In fact, all sides would probably be mutually better off if they read this book. It advances civil society by promoting talk over violence and anger. I wonder why these books are not required reading for high school students. I certainly wish I had come across them when I was younger.

B000PMG16U|5.0|[[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I'm a first-generation Star Wars fan since 1977, having seen the original versions of the original three films in the theater one time each as a child, then falling in love with them all over again on VHS in 1987. And I've been a huge fan ever since. The Star Wars Saga is the ultimate epic space opera and film series.<br /><br />This isn't actually a review of the movies most of you reading this will have seen one or more versions of dozens of times, although this review will discuss some of the changes made to the films.<br /><br />I actually own the six-film Star Wars Saga blu-ray set linked above, and I reviewed that. The movie discs in this product are 3 of the same discs from the larger Saga set, so I thought I would edit that review down to only discuss the prequel trilogy discs themselves and post it here. This is meant to be an overview with personal observations and select commentary thrown in.<br /><br />DISC PHYSICAL QUALITIES<br /><br />The discs themselves are heavy-duty, yet smooth and well-coated with scratch resistance - the best available in retail products I've seen. The discs themselves do not have any images - they are light grey with blue trimmings. The discs have the previously used logos of STAR WARS with the episode subtitle underneath, both on top of the episode number in the form of a large Roman numeral.<br /><br />THE FILM DISCS<br /><br />This is as good a place as any to mention that there are two audio commentary tracks for each of the films of blu-ray.  There are the same ones from the previous DVD versions of these films, and then new commentaries compiled from \\"archival interviews with cast and crew\\".  I don't enjoy listening to commentaries while watching adventure films, but I will force myself to listen to the new tracks once (as I did for the original DVD commentaries).<br /><br />As I have only had one frame of reference for viewing the blu-ray films, I thought I should first specify what that is, in case my experiences are in any way relative to my equipment and viewing conditions.  This may mean more to you than it does to me.  My blu-ray player is a Sony BDP-S350.  My HD TV is a Sony Bravia KDL-40V4100, a flat-screen LCD with a diagonal of a little over a meter.  My blu-ray player and TV are both almost 3 years old.  My line of vision is exactly 90° to the plane of the TV screen, and my eyes and ears are at a height equal to about 1/3 up from the bottom edge of the screen.  I'm sitting such that the distance of my head to the TV screen is a little more than the width of the Death Star's thermal exhaust port.<br /><br />The Films on Blu-ray<br /><br />All three films sound and look awesome in HD! Even Revenge of the Sith, which had the least room for improvement, is substantially better.  All three films sound and look awesome in HD! I fully appreciate all the effort that had to go into improving the resolution of over 6 hours of high-quality sci-fi entertainment, frame-by-frame. Coruscant from space is breathtakingly gorgeous!<br /><br />There is one significant exception in the HD upgrade.  A very logical and fitting artistic choice was made in the rendering of the holograms of characters.  Throughout the all six movies, it looks like the holograms were not upgraded to HD, now looking somewhat pixilated compared to the surrounding \\"reality\\" they are projected into.  This of course is easily explained in-universe as they are just not high-resolution transmissions, and I feel this actually works to improve the illusion of the entire scene seeming real.  The holograms are now an intentional vestige of the analogue age, left behind to honor the origin and evolution of the Star Wars films themselves which began as motion picture projections but have now become the ultra-realistic-looking digital media.  A very nice touch.  And the hologram effects also seems more unified between the two trilogies now.)<br /><br />A significant improvement that the HD upgrade also provides is a solution to a common criticism I have ran into since 1999.  Over the years I have heard many Star Wars fans express that the addition of GC characters and objects into the films seems unrealistic, in not only the updated versions of the classic trilogy but even the prequels.  Ironically, these fans seem to have no trouble accepting the un-reality of rubber muppet characters, but CG is somehow unacceptable in their vision of the Star Wars universe.  Well, now muppets, rubber masks, human actors and CG characters can all exist in visual harmony together, thanks to the wonders of HD.  The increase in resolution seems to have unified the apparent realities of them all.  Now the real-world elements of the scenes have been \\"raised\\" to the same level of visual reality of the CG elements, resulting in the CG elements seeming to much more naturally blend in with their surroundings.  This adds in a whole new level of visual realism to the films, perhaps being the greatest achievement of these new blu-ray versions of the films.<br /><br />Now I'll go into more detail about some of the blu-ray enhancements and changes specific to each film.<br /><br />Episode I: The Phantom Menace<br /><br />The effect for the Jedi Knights speeding away from the droidekas on the Trade Federation ship has been improved.  The original effects error of the two-headed pod race announcer's hand passing through his vest was fixed.<br /><br />The big change that even the die hard purists don't seem to mind so much is the complete and utter removal of that awful imitation Yoda muppet.  The TPM muppet bore a vague resemblance to the original muppet from the sequels, but I thought that the TMP muppet could at most pass for Yoda's crazy spice-addicted brother.  I know some fans that feel the CG Yoda model from AotC and RotS was not as good as the original muppet, but even they would agree that the prequel CG model looks a lot more like the original muppet than the TMP muppet did.  And in blu-ray the CG Yoda in all 3 prequels looks more realistic now, so I'm very happy with this change.<br /><br />Episodes II: Attack of the Clones & Episodes II: Revenge of the Sith<br /><br />These mostly only had minute editorial tweaks like the exact transition between scenes, moving a couple reaction shots and dialogue lines to a slightly different part of a scene.  The only really somewhat significant change is adding a line of dialogue in AotC where Anakin is having a nightmare about his mother while staying on Naboo.  Shmi Skywalker's voice is now heard pleading for Anakin's help with the echo effect (signifying it is a thought or dream in Anakin's mind).  It does accomplish the addition of a little more urgency to the drama of the film.<br /><br />FINAL WORDS<br /><br />You may not agree with all the opinions I expressed here, but if you are reading this then you must be a Star Wars fan of some kind on some level.  If so, then do yourself a favor and watch all six films on blu-ray at least once, even if you have no intention of ever owning them.  You'll see much more than I could possibly ever hope to describe in words.  And if you wish to criticize the blu-ray versions after viewing them, at least you'll then have an educated opinion for doing so.<br /><br />In my first viewing of Star Wars: The Complete Saga, the rich Star Wars multiverse has deepened in a way I couldn't have even imagined before seeing the films on blu-ray.  While still not perfect, my favorite films have just gotten an incredible amount better.  As impossible as it previously seemed, I'm somehow now even more of a Star Wars fan than I was before.  But this blu-ray release has also reminded me that EVERY version of any Star Wars film is awesome!<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free the ask.

030788743X|5.0|This is another book I discovered from Cory Doctorow's recommendation, and it didn't disappoint. Being a child of the 80s, it was pretty hard to not get into the nostalgia of it all. You can read the synopsis, so I won't rehash it, but it's chock full of nerd culture references, action, internal strife, and especially someone to hate (sixers/IOI). Cline does a good job of involving the reader and making him really care about the problems his characters face, and actually consider if this is our future. I'll be looking for future books by Cline.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|If you take a lot of pictures with your phone this is a fun little app. The best thing about it is that you do not have to take pictures with the using the paper camera app (although that is an option) you can apply the paper camera effects to any picture on your phone, whether you took it with the phone camera or downloaded it. This earns it five stars even though the controls for the contrast, brightness, and lines features are hard to use. There are several effects to choose from, some suit some pictures better than others. Overall the app is a very fun, artistic little tool.

0981951244|4.0|The Compound Effect written by Darren Hardy, Publisher of Success magazine is a rather short, easy to read book.  It contains some very valuable lessons and insights on what it takes to achieve success.  There are no magic bullets.  In fact, this book is the polar opposite of books which promise success without work.<br /><br />Mr. Hardy is the poster child for discipline and hard work.  His personality and philosophy come through very strong in this book.  I believe the major lesson to be gained from this book is that small, consistent actions ultimately determine the quality of your life.  Far too many people try exercise or self-improvement for a short period of time and then give up because they are not seeing instant results.  The whole point of the book is that you do not need major blockbuster achievements to be successful.  What you really need to do is to make small but constant progress towards your goals.<br /><br />Darren often quotes the lessons he learned from Jim Rohn.  While you will only get a small sample of Jim Rohn's teachings, it is apparent that Jim had a significant influence on Mr. Hardy and his success.<br /><br />The author quotes many personalities/stories which have been featured in Success magazine.  He also talks extensively about himself and his achievements.  Some people may be turned off with the frequent references to Success magazine or his references to his own personal achievements.  I did not find them excessive and felt like the stories furthered the points he was trying to make about what it takes to achieve success.<br /><br />The major value from this book is the concept that success is not an overnight thing.  Almost anyone can achieve a very high degree of success if they will get totally clear about what they want and then become very disciplined in the pursuit of those goals.  It is not the big breakthroughs that are the hallmark of highly successful people.  It is the constant, steady striving towards their goals - the ability to go on when others have dropped out which brings the ultimate success.<br /><br />If you have read many self-improvement books, you will not discover that much new in this book.  What is unique is the emphasis placed on the compounding of your small efforts.<br /><br />It is certainly worth reading.  If you implement what you read, you will eventually achieve your goals.d out which brings the ultimate success.

B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I must've been the only one of my friends who did not enjoy \\"Something Borrowed\\" which is the previous title to this follow-up, \\"Something Blue\\". I do believe that no matter how horrible your friend, let alone best friend, is as a person, you should never sleep with their fiance! Rachel should have been honest from the start. However, with that said, I was so happy to see that Emily Giffen followed up with a novel dedicated to Darcy and the aftermath of being left single, pregnant with no best friend to lean on for moral support. I only hope a follow-up movie will be made for this novel as well!<br />This book is a fun beach read. I felt like I was reading a romantic comedy, literally! I have read Giffen's other titles but this one is by far my favorite! Giffen really let's us see into Darcy's shallow mind and soul but also keeps us rooting for her to change and mature. And Ethan?! What an amazing character! I was glad to see he was back!<br />I would definitely recommend this book, even if you haven't read \\"Something Borrowed\\". This book stands great on it's own as well!

B0053TMP24|4.0|Finally Riordan gives his readers what we have wanted. Percy Jackson is back! This story doesnt have quite the same emotional impact is original percy story, because I never felt like Percy was in any real danger. In fact neither did Percy at some points, making this seem more like a peaceful interlude to the real story. Like Jason, Percy lost his memory and finds himself against the odds all over agian. Only like I mentioned earlier theres no real doubt that Percy will get his memory back. Or that he'll survive. Even his greatest enemy helps him out halfway through. And even after saving everyone the author tries to add a lil drama by making it unclear whether his new allies will trust him. A little bit of a stretch in my opinion. This book feels a little thin like I mentioned but none the less it was an enjoyable and quick read and at least Percy is back! Kinda...
1558908382|4.0|A fun, dark comedy about a hitman who has to do a job in his hometown and also decides to go to his 10 year high school reunion. The problem is that nobody has been in contact with him for those ten years, including a prom date he left hanging, a good friend who now sells real estate and several other people from his high school days, including his parents. It almost feels as if this role was written for Cusack as he falls into it so easily. Dan Akroyd plays his assassin opponent who wants him to join the newly formed union or die so that they can regulate business. Toss in the FBI and some other hit men and you've got yourself a lot of good movie moments. The gunfights will sometimes not look realistic. Newsflash: it's intentional. Jeremy Piven, who plays Cusack's real estate friend still trying to get noticed by one of the old cheerleaders, does an awesome job. Watch for his dance scene with the cheerleader. Chemistry between Cusack and Driver is quite good in a PG sort of way. Alan Arkin arguably doesn't get enough screen time and Jenna Elfman and Ann Cusack have very small roles in this film.  The budget for this was $15M but it made over $28M at the box office. 80s and 90s soundtrack music galore. DARK COMEDY FOCUS/HUMOR: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: September 2011.

B002I0J5FG|1.0|Here is my breakdown.  I played ICO first, and started Shadow of Colossus afterwards.  ICO  By far the worst game I ever forced myself to play through to the end.  Some people call this game \\"art\\"; I call it a game with no story, no music, poor fighting mechanics, poor controls, bad camera control, dumb AI, and pretty much horrible everything else.  There is very few redeeming qualities to this game.  Here is a quick summary so you never have to suffer through the game (Spoilers?):  From the very start, your are given absolutely no instructions or back story.  You make your way out the only possible door you can go through and find some chick in a cage (Yorda).  You break her free for some reason and, once you figure out how, you proceed to drag her around aimlessly.  Then you find a stick, some smoke monsters pop up, they try dragging her into some mysterious holes, you beat them with a stick, and they disappear.  You move some boxes, climb some ladders, and when your not holding Yorda's hand, your screaming \\"maaaaaah, maaaaaah, ooompha, ooompha, maaaaaaah, ooompha, ooompha, ooompha\\", and that is pretty much 99% of your dialog with her.  Then it is pretty much this same thing repeated until the end of the game.  There is probably 5 minutes total of actual story dialog, half of which is complete untranslated gibberish.  I can see how people might consider this art because it makes you think, but after I finished the game I concluded it was just pure laziness.  Here was my though process:  Why is this chick in this cage?  Why am I dragging this chick around?  Why am I in this castle in the first place?  Why is this castle so damn big?, whoever designed it went way overboard and it would have been much cheaper to build it about 1/100 the size...  Why do these smoke things not want to kill me so much?  Why is the only piece of furniture in the entire castle a couch?    Who lives here?    What am I yelling at Yorda, and why does it look like I'm trying to shoo her away?Why is there no decorations, or rugs, or any other furniture?  How does this castle stay lit so well with so little light fixtures?  Why am I still dragging this chick around?  Why am I still playing this game?  Why am I still playing this game?  Why am I still playing this game?  etc...  It is a decent puzzler, but as every puzzle has one clear path you must go and only one way to get there, it usually just makes it a mindless journey.  I did get stumped in two locations though and had to look at a guide out of pure frustration.  Once when I had no idea you could pull Yorda out of the sewer, and another when your supposed to jump off that flipper thing at the point that makes the least amount of sense.  I am sure the sure size of the levels was impressive back in 2000 something on the PS2 and it seems like they spent a lot of time on them as they are pretty well thought out.  But it seems like all the budget was blown on that.  There is pretty much no music to be had in the entire game, you spend most of your time listening to the wind blow and birds chirping. The fighting is tedious and not the least bit fun.  The controls can be frustrating at times, especially with the uncontrollable camera rotating wildly around you.  I recommend this game to people who find sitting with their grandma, piecing together a jigsaw puzzle fun.  It is about on the same level as that.  I give this game a fun value of 0, and an overall value of 0.  There is nothing good about this game what-so-ever.  Shadow of Colossus  This game looks really cool.  It actually has some what of a story, it briefly explains the controls, it has music!  Looks like they actually spent some time on this game!  The Colossi look really great as well!  It had so much going for it!  .... but then there is the controls.... the awful, awful controls.  They actually give you camera control this time around, which is great, but they are still wonky and trying to make your character move the way you want is difficult (especially trying to control the horse).  I honestly couldn't pinpoint why they were so bad, it just wasn't intuitive and didn't flow right.  Also, be prepared to hold down the R1 button a lot, and then get frustrated as the same button combination that jumps and grabs also ducks and rolls.  Yes, two opposite movements are controlled by the same two buttons.  I think they could have been better off if they just had it auto grab things for you like ICO, then just have a button to drop (you know, like every other game out there).  I honestly didn't make it past the first Colossi though; partially due to the maddening controls, and partially because of the previous disappointment that was ICO.  I normally don't give a review of something I haven't beaten, but in this case I am going to give it the benefit of the doubt and rate it an overall of 2 stars.    These games are definitely not for everyone, so purchase carefully.

B005G4TJUC|1.0|Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow.

B005F6NA56|4.0|Leslie Feist proves she's here for the long haul on \\"Metals,\\" the Canadian singer's fourth studio album, and her first as an artist living in the limelight.<br /><br />It's been four years since Feist sent up her diva sprouts on \\"The Reminder,\\" which gave her four Grammy nods, sold 2.5 million copies worldwide, landed on scads of critics' Top 10 lists, led to a guest spot singing with Elmo on \\"Sesame Street\\" -- and wormed its way into the head of anyone with functioning ears for the use of its hit, \\"1234,\\" in an iPod Nano commercial. She even boasts an \\"awards and nominations\\" page on Wikipedia, almost entirely devoted to that 2007 album.<br /><br />Feist makes it clear with \\"Metals\\" that none of this has gone to her head, turning in a wide-ranging effort on which she exhibits a voice that is richer, clearer and more adventurous than ever -- chiefly due to a deeper concentration on her vocal intonations, but also due in part to a heartfelt, full-blooded production.<br /><br />Feist creates highly involved melody lines, as on the sprightly \\"The Circle Married the Line,\\" with its tinkling of keyboards, syrupy oboe and beckoning strings. It almost sounds like two voices singing as she intones the quaint metaphor, \\"First line was / last line was / all right when the circle married the line.\\" The song is much better in its studio form than when she performed it during a KCRW-Los Angeles radio webcast last week.<br /><br />\\"Metals,\\" which actually does feature the use of various metals as instrumentation throughout, is a laid-back, sprawling and often celebratory affair. Feist, longtime member of Canadian indie collective Broken Social Scene, seems more relaxed and far more curious here than on any previous solo outing. This is evidenced on the opening track, \\"The Bad in Each Other,\\" with its lurch of brass, heavy bass drum and North Mississippi blues guitar swirling about as Feist floats above, agonizing over failed relationships.<br /><br />Feist doesn't operate within the boundaries of pop on this outing, taking her focus off her guitar work and bringing in what sounds like a full orchestra. The artist took a year off from music before beginning work on the album, due to exhaustion (probably ennui brought on by performing \\"1234\\" too many times). Maybe she was just looking for something new to bring to her live shows so she wouldn't get bored.<br /><br />While \\"Metals\\" is a less extroverted affair than \\"Reminder,\\" there being no instant hits in residence, the experimentation at play more than makes up the difference. \\"A Commotion,\\" which rides a Steve Reich's \\"Different Trains\\"-like melody -- right down to a backing chorus making train-whistle sounds -- and finds male voices shouting out the title, is a particular standout, hinting that there may be no limit to what Feist can bring to the table.ocus off her guitar work and bringing in what sounds like a full orchestra.

0553801473|4.0|As it has been mentioned in other reviews, this book is really about getting the pieces (characters) in place for the final books in the series.  For those not deeply invested in the main characters, I can definitely see how this book could be quite boring.  Personally, I pored through the book waiting for the big events to start happening.  By the end I was disappointed because they never did.<br /><br />As far as the characters that we all know an love, they are here and readers get to follow them through many adjustments and transformations.  If you love the characters, there is a ton of character building in this book.  That is pretty much what this book is.<br /><br />If you are looking for plot and war and the beginning of the end game of the entire Song of Ice and Fire series, it ain't here.

B004EQAVFU|2.0|Good for rainy day when both of your legs are broken and you can't reach the sleeping pills.  Well acted, beautifully photographed. Story line barely believable. In this movie's society, for people to know the horror of their fate and not act upon it stretches reason to the breaking point. Had this been placed in a Sci Fi setting, or a Nazi prison camp, it might have been a riveting drama. As it was, the only riveting moment in the entire film was when the headmistress comments on why the children submit their drawings for review.  You keep asking yourself, \\"Why would anyone put up with this\\"? All of the actors deserve a better story line.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|i'm so relieved that i found this controller.  i was so excited when i got my ps3 after years of owning an xbox360-- all the games i'd read about all these years were finally within my grasp.  excitement soon turned to frustration (and cramping) when, after just a few hours of gameplay, i realized the limitations of sony's controller-- tiny size, unfortunately placed (and rounded) analog sticks, select and start buttons virtually unreachable behind said analog sticks, and tiny, rounded trigger buttons.  i'd never given a single thought to my xbox360 controller, but now, set in stark relief against sony's, it's brilliant, intuitive design and sturdy construction really began to shine through.  sometimes, after playing with the sony controller for a few hours, i would actually pick up my 360 controller and just appreciate how good it felt in my hands.  when i searched amazon thinking that an xbox360 styled ps3 controller must exist, i found the pro elite.  i quickly ordered it along with a copy of uncharted: drake's fortune.  well, i just finished that game (about 10 hours of gameplay) using the pro elite, and i must say that i'm really quite impressed.  there's none of the cheapness so often found with 3rd party peripherals.  and the design is close enough to that of the 360's controller that it felt like slipping into an old pair of jeans.  it's not exactly the same, though.  the triggers aren't quite as pronounced, the textured \\"handles\\" feel pretty good but are sort of inconsequential, the d-pad feels a bit floaty (though don't they all), and it doesn't have quite as much heft to it, which i miss.  the back-lit buttons look awesome, and are quite useful as i play in a darkened room much of the time.  and the dead zone that you've most likely read about already is there, though to my eye it's not as huge as some have said and i didn't even notice it after a few minutes of game play.  i admit, though, that i don't play a lot of shooters-- half-life, quake and turokare pretty much it for me.  i'm planning on playing through the resistance series very soon, so maybe i'll make an addendum then.  overall, this is a great controller, and a real godsend for those ps3 owners who are spoiled by the 360 controller, have large hands (as i do), or just appreciate non-poorly thought out controllers (yeah you, sony).  the only thing that would make the pro elite better is if it were actually made by microsoft-- and i never thought i would utter those words within my lifetime.  well done, Power A!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Let me start by saying that the primary use of this headset is for Call of Duty, when I first bought it I was amazed because I didn't know games were so detailed. I put them on to play GH 6 and trust me, it sounds way better than my surround sound I discovered sounds in the music that I didn't even know were there.   The build quality is strong, I don't know why people complain, mine are always thrown around on the table and when I wear them I treat them with care because I know they are not freaking indestructible unlike many people that complain.   Overall very good for owning noobs and for listening to music.
1933633867|5.0|David Graeber is a man after my own heart. Since the crisis in 2008, I've been reading up on economics in order to understand what was going on around me. i read milton friedman's monetary history of the united states, keynes's general theory, Minsky's stabilizing an unstable economy, galbraith's crash of 2008, adam smith's theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations... and a whole bunch of other stuff that i wouldn't want to bore you with. the point is i read literally thousands of pages of stuff in a whole bunch of different formats in order to understand what was going on around me. Eventually I came to view money (but notably not some other things) in ways similar to Chartalists. Money isn't my only interest however, and as i started to branch out i came to look at other social sciences for insights into economics. i read a few economic sociology books and a few political science books.     then i came to anarchism. anarchism was interesting to me because there views on the state seemed to have a lot of affinities with chartalism and i wanted to learn more, especially their views on what a non-capitalist society might look like. unfortunately, to my great annoyance, some of the anarchists i know seem to hold anachronistic views about government default almost in reaction to keynesian ideas about achieving full employment. it must be nice to be a radical who thinks capitalism is going to collapse on itself any day now because the government will go \\"bankrupt\\". anyways through a chapter written by a chartalist about anarchist economic thought (here: (...), i found David Graeber's book fragments of an anarchist anthropology. i was deeply impressed by that book. the method of presentation, the meticulous citation and the ideas presented were very interesting. i remained (and still remain) unsure about anarchism (particularly by questions of food distribution and production to an overpopulated planet and by the ability of societies to coerce people into notbeing coercive) but i certainly was interested in his writing.    Then, a few months later, i heard about this book! i mean an author i was deeply impressed with and wanted to read more of is publishing a book on my favorite subject where he takes up a position I hold, and am surprised anarchists haven't been taking up! talk about a mind reader!    He wrote this book from a perspective that holds largely Chartalist views of money, but this book is so much more then that. it gets across a large body of historical and anthropological literature that is related and is able to make connections in ways you haven't considered. I've already talked about how much i like his writing style.I like everything about this book although i wished he had talked more about \\"practical metallism\\" ie the Gresham's dynamics involved with using metal or paper as money even if it is taxes that give money value. i also think he is uniquely positioned to talk about why printing money in a society of peasants might be more inflationary then printing money in a society of workers, but alas David Graeber can't write every thought I've ever had (although he's trying!) if you're reading this David Graeber, i would love to have a conversation with you. maybe when i get back home to new york city for thanksgiving we can meet at occupy wall street. oh it's almost needless to say, i read this book in 3 days in between college classes (never let school get in the way of learning). pick it up.
0307946711|2.0|I had heard good things about One Day, but I gotta say I was a little underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. For the five people out there who haven't seen the movie trailers, in One Day, Dexter and Emma hook up on the day of their college graduation. Each chapter of the book provides an update on Dex and Em on that same date each year for the next twenty years, culminating in a (semi-complete) story of their friendship and eventual relationship.  I think my biggest issue with this book was that the characters were pretty annoying. I didn't really understand what drew them together and kept them together. Dex was totally self-centered, a little vain, and kind of a wanderer. Em was self-conscious, doubting, and a bit stuck in her life. Supposedly he was dreamy. Supposedly she was beautiful in an unconscious way. They won't get together but won't stay out of each others' lives. You know they're going to get together eventually but there's no real suspense or tension while waiting for them to bite the bullet. It just felt like neither Dex nor Em were capable of committing to anything, let alone to each other.  I think this is one of those books that was written to be made into a movie script. I actually think the movie will be better than the book, because Anne Hathaway is capable of giving the story a little more depth than I got from the book. Still probably won't see it in the theater, but maybe a renter?  In a nutshell: Not a bad read, just not great. Two and a half stars.

0385341008|5.0|Oh how I would love to live among the characters in this book as I feel I know them so well. I often listen to audio books in my car and some readings are better than others.  I would bet I have listened to more than 300 books in the last couple of years. But out of all of them this has to be my favorite. Set on Guernsey, a channel island between Great Britain and France during and after World War II, the book documents mostly the written exchanges between the characters. In the audio version each character has a different voice! An individual actor, not something I've come across before. It makes you feel so close to the characters that you would feel comfortable having tea with them in person. Are there truly people this caring and loving anywhere? Do those people exist on Guernsey? Is it as beautiful as they say? Should I sell my belongings and pick up lock stock and barrel, kids and cats in tow and move there? Though there are difficult parts in the book to listen/read through, the lack of food, the mistreatment by the Germans, the death of a main character the warmth and caring of the individuals made me wish the book went on forever. During the last 2 CD's I found myself driving extra slow (much to the dismay of the people driving behind me!) to have the time to listen to the book longer and when I put in the last CD I found myself feeling a little sad as I knew it would be coming to an end. I normally give away, donate or trade my audio books, but this one I'm going to keep. It affected me in such a positive way.  Anyone else want to move to Guernsey with me? (I have to thank my mother in law Peggy for recommending this book!)

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I remember 10 years ago when the first installment in the Harry Potter film series was about to be released and how excited a co-worker of mine (at the time) was to see it. I couldn't understand why she was so excited and when she compared the book series to Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Lucas's masterpiece saga \\"Star Wars,\\" I definitely was perplexed and cynical. After all, how could a few books (at the time) about a boy wizard compare to the profound mythological themes that represent life itself? Unlike most fans, I did not read the books and went into the film with an unbiased mind. When I saw the first installment, \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\\" I wasn't really impressed. It wasn't until 2004's \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" -- when the series began getting darker -- that I started getting into the series. Now, I'm still no major fan, but I thoroughly enjoy Harry Potter and am reading the books. When I heard \\"Deathly Hallows\\" was going to be separated into two parts, I actually liked the idea because I knew the filmmakers were so dedicated to getting in as much as they could of the book and did not want to rush the production. With \\"Deathly Hallows, Part One,\\" I found a slight similarity to Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece \\"Kill Bill.\\" In [[ASIN:B004SIP8OI Kill Bill: Volume 1 [Blu-ray]]], there was plenty of action, while in [[ASIN:B004SIP8SY Kill Bill: Volume 2 [Blu-ray]]], there was still a little action, but mostly talk, drama and psychological meanings. Well, in \\"Deathly Hallows Part One,\\" the parts were switched so that it was the one that was made up of mostly talk, drama and psychological elements. In this installment, \\"Deathly Hallows\\" goes out with a bang the way \\"Kill Bill Part One\\" did; it's basically non-stop action with the drama as a natural after-effect. Only in \\"Deathly Hallows Part Two,\\" rather than ending with a jaw-dropping question (like \\"Kill Bill Part One\\"), it ends with satisfying closure for pretty much all of the characters and the acting is superb (anyone who wants to know how the other characters' futures end up, you can either read the books or look it up on the internet); I was one of many in the audience who was cheering when seeing what happens to Bellatrix (Helena Bonham-Carter, an actress I don't very much like). Before this one, my favorite of the Harry Potter film series was \\"The Half-Blood Prince.\\" I still have a while before I'll be able to tell what my favorite book is in the series, but I can stand corrected in saying now that I can see the attraction to the Harry Potter series. Its themes do follow those of such aforementioned revered sagas from Tolkien and Lucas. While it is sad to see this series come to a close, I cherish the fact that I still have children to whom I can pass on these books and films.characters and the acting is superb (anyone who wants to know how the other characters' futures end up, you can either read the books or look it up on the internet); I was one of many in the audience who was cheering when seeing what happens to Bellatrix (Helena Bonham-Carter, an actress I don't very much like).

B00005JOA0|4.0|This 3 part BBC adaptation of the Anne Bronte novel runs 160 minutes total.<br /><br />Nicely shot, with a lot of surprisingly modern camera techniques for a Bronte novel.<br />Usually this works well, although occasionally it gets self conscious (a couple too<br />many 360 shots).<br /><br />The acting is solid, with Tara Fitzgerald an edgy but still empathetic heroine.  But<br />Rupert Graves' switch from flawless seducer to \\"worst man in the world\\" type villain<br />is a bit over the top, although that may be the material, or approach more than<br />performance.  Indeed, at times I could feel Graves (a very good actor) trying to<br />maintain some humanity under the almost gothic heartlessness.<br /><br />The music is interesting and effectively anachronistic as well, often sounding<br />something the Cocteau Twins, but as with the cinematography after a while it<br />starts to get both repetitive and too self consciously avant-garde for a story<br />mostly told in a straightforward Masterpiece Theater fashion.<br /><br />Lastly, the tidy ending bothered me a bit.  The film did a good enough job capturing<br />the complex difficulties of life, that I found myself wish for something that felt more<br />honestly open ended.<br /><br />All that said, I still enjoyed the story, the scenery, and being transported into another time<br />and place as only good storytelling can do.  A quite good adaptation, I just wished it was<br />great, and for 30 minutes or so, thought it might be.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|This one is a definite improvement from its predecessor [[ASIN:B001KZIRM2 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]], but, then again, it didn't take much. I did like the action -- one of the most action-packed films of the summer. Shia LaBeouf is good as always. And I liked the inclusion of Soundwave and Shockwave, two of the coolest Decepticons. But all of that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie. Despite delving deeper into the Transformers epic world-ending battle, which was another driving plot-point from \\"Revenge,\\" this film had elements that don't make sense -- the first being Laserbeak disguising himself as a pink female autobot. No. That's not how it is in the mythology and it's a little too close to the whole human female transformer from \\"Revenge\\"; if I wanted cyborgs, I'd watch [[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y The Terminator [Blu-ray]]]. Again, no. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam's new love interest -- they've found an \\"actress\\" that acts worse than Megan Fox; next time, try an actress that has a little more depth rather than being hot. And the most important aspect that is lacking is the film's ending. It fizzles; there's all that action but no strong ending for the characters. It is extremely lame for the conclusion of a trilogy.
0553801473|2.0|I read G.R.R.Martin's Song of Ice and Fire Series several years ago and loved them. I re-read them recently to prepare not only for the publication of A Dance With Dragons but also before I watched the HBO series starting with A Game of Thrones.  I was excited at the prospect of a new chapter in Stark and Lannister lives but I was very disappointed.  It seemed as if he had written his first draft, chopped it down to 995 pages and given it to his publishers without editing or reviewing the content. Had I not read his first four novels in the series I wouldn't have read past Chapter Five.  Yes, he warned his fans some of the characters from the earlier books would not appear in this book but their stories would be taken up in Book 6. That wasn't the issue. It was the lackluster job he did presenting the characters that he did include and their sloppy story lines.<br /><br />Martin has an amazing ability to build credible, fascinating characters that you love or love to hate. Tyrion, for example, is flawed physically but possesses his father's intellect and political savvy without the inherent evil and lust for power (or a sibling!). Not so in this book. The insight, wisdom and basic goodness are just not apparent and I am not looking forward to seeing him joust on a pig's back when HBO gets to the fifth series.  Meanwhile, Brandon Stark wanders north guided by guardians we still know almost nothing about and seems content to become a tree. Jon Snow, newly elected  to command the Watchers on the Wall, is taken out by those who just elected him. Stannis Baratheon is determined to take Winterfell back to rescue the Arya substitute from Roose Bolton's son but nothing happens other than a seige of sorts defeated by the weather.  Ramsay Bolton gets far more ink than he merits and there is way too much detail of his sadistic treatment of \\" Reek \\".  We would have picked up that he was a \\" bad person\\" without chapters of gory details that do nothing to move the plot along.. Iwould much rather know why Theon turned on the family he grew up with and betrayed them.<br /><br />Explicit sex and violence were part of the first four books. They helped paint a picture of an earlier civilization where life was short and often brutal and you took your pleasures where you found them, while you could. A Dance with Dragons just wallows in brutality, sadism and any chance of having sex anywhere, anyhow with anyone. It wasn't offensive or shocking in the earlier book nor was it boring. Sadly not the same could be said about this book.<br /><br />The worst thing was that the story didn't get anywhere, nothing was resolved and new characters with their own, previously unheard story lines  were added to confuse the issue. So the dragons escaped, so the Sand Vipers were released, so Cersei got a little of what we had hoped was coming to her, while Jaime appears to be turning to \\"good side of the force\\" under Brienne's influence! After 900+ pages, it didn't really matter. The only part of the book that I really liked was Arya's story and her trials and growth in The House of the Dead.<br /><br />I think if Martin had taken another year to take the manuscript he had and plan more carefully how to divide it into books five and six, he could only have improved his fifth offering. I can't see why the haste when the first HBO series is so successful and so many of us aching for round two... we would have still rushed out to buy Book Five. I doubt I will buy Book Six. I will probably get it out of the library and buy my own copy if it is as good as the first four in the series.
0312600844|1.0|i normally don't write reviews but was compelled to say don't read this book. it's goes on and on with no end in sight and clearly wasn't edited. could have been 200 pages less and would've saved me a lot of wasted time in my life that i can't get back.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Not sure why people aren't able to find this feature, but yes, it *IS* possible to apply the effects to images already in your gallery.  After you've launched the app, at the bottom of the screen, to the right of the effect name (e.g. Comic Boom) and to the left of the camera icon (lower right-hand corner of your screen) should be a square icon with some lines in it.  Click on that icon and the app will launch your gallery app so that you can select a photo.  From there, you can choose the affect and click the save icon where the camera icon used to be.  As for the app itself, it is a fun little app, well worth the $2 asking price.  Not sure how useful it is, but definitely fun.  Since it is the FAotD, I'd definitely get it.

B005FITIO6|5.0|First off, in no way do I condone the actions in the film. By them-selves and in real life, they are beyond despicable.<br /><br />However, this is film noir - mixed with Spanish melodrama - mixed with psychological and physical thriller - mixed with an elegant painting - mixed with a powerful statement.<br /><br />There was The Crying Game, there was Boxing Helena (directed by Lynch's daughter).<br />No film has been created like this one...<br /><br />The Skin I Live In uses melodrama to distance the audience from the deep horrors within the story. Horrors that are so elegantly painted by Almod&oacute;var that a viewer feels, like they are in a virtual macabre painting.<br />While one can not agree with the violence shown, the beauty of the film-making, the risk, the lack of boundaries, the eye-acting, the colours, schemes, pallets, dimensions, depths, panics, laughs, pain and horror are masked with unbelievably beautiful film-making.<br /><br />I am stunned and mesmerized by the editing, the 2012/2006 half and halves, the circular nature of the story, the shock of what actually occurs.<br />Surely for a bible-study class, this would be a sinful picture. Perhaps a Devil's Film.<br />But Art is meant to peek into the psyche, to expose that which lurks. It can be done in a brazen class-less way (i.e. horror/torture film) or in a spotless, clean and brisk moving art piece.<br /><br />- Mikhail Tank, artist [...]
B0058VW36U|5.0|I got this app for free but its easily worth $0.99.  I got 3 stars on every level fairly quick, wasn't very hard for me, so that was a downside but it was still a lot of fun. They already released another level and there are more to come!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I had been hesitant to purchase this app, even though it did look awesome. When it came up for free, I jumped on it, and couldn't be more stoked. It's great! You can take super cool, super detailed pictures, or you can add the effects to photos in your gallery. I'm very pleased, and excited.  Thanks for the great app!

0807014273|5.0|This book presents the whole spectrum of what a human being is capable of.  From kindness to cruelty, from empathy to indifference to others, it is all there in Viktor Frankl's recollections of his concentration camp experiences.  He is concerned with presenting the three stages that concentration camp prisoners go through, and what can be learned from those stages.<br /><br />The book consists of two parts.  The first half deals with his experiences in the concentration camp.  The second part deals with the form of psychotherapy that he created called Logotherapy.<br /><br />Every form of psychotherapy has a particular emphasis.  For example, Rational Emotive Therapy emphasizes rational thinking as the key to improving mental health.  In Viktor Frankl's Logotherapy, the emphasis is on the individual finding meaning in his or her life.  To quote Dr. Frankl, \\"According to Logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.\\"  There is no one ultimate abstract meaning of life, but very personal meanings of life.  Dr. Frankl argues that even in the most difficult experiences that life can present to a person, that person can choose to find a meaning in that suffering.  His life was a shining example of that truth.<br /><br />Here are a few reasons why I admire Dr. Frankl.  He had the opportunity to emigrate to the United States, and thus be spared the concentration camp experiences, but chose to remain with his parents.  He rejected the idea of \\"collective guilt.\\"  He could have emigrated after the war to almost any country, but chose to stay in Austria and devote himself to the patients there.  He could have been bitter, but he chose to be giving.  Having lost all of his family, he married again.  In short, he chose love and responsibility all along the way.<br /><br />The prisoners at the concentration camp were stripped of everything that gave them dignity.  Each was assigned a number.  Dr. Frankl's number was 119,104.  I suspect that if a number could feel, then the number 119,104 would feel honored to have been assigned to such a one as Dr. Viktor E. Frankl.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I don't generally review my items, but I have to say I really like this case.  It's almost a combination of a hard case and a silicone case, as it is slightly flexible, but hard enough to give you peace of mind without the weight.  The smoke color is low-key and classy, and I also like the cut-out for the Apple logo.  I failed miserably at the screen protector, but it does not affect my review of this excellent case.  Highly recommended.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|great app and easy to use.  I have used this type of filter before on image editing softwsre, it is cool.  Having it on the camera is better.  To those who say you can't edit existing photos, learn how to use the app before commenting, I was editing existing photos within 1 min of installing it.  note date of the less then stellar reviews, the most current ones praise the app more than the older ones.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|This movie! Right here! Looks AMAZING!!! I swear Lion King has never looked better than in the blu ray diamond Edition!  This and Beauty and the Beast Bluray are some of the best animated blu rays I have ever seen!  Lines are more detailed, colors more vibrant, the picture is all around just beautiful. Cant say much for the sound, not much of a sound person, but imo Lion King has always sounded perfect. If you are still thinking about purchasing this, shame on you! Buy it NOW:) you won't regret it.
B005974CNA|5.0|I don't write too many reviews.  And to be honest, I haven't really paid all that much attention to Dream Theater in the last few years.  Frankly, their last two or three albums have been like a one-note symphony.  They always have exhibited excellent musicianship, but something about what they were \\"saying\\" musically was, to me at least, very one dimensional.  I still bought their CDs, but didn't really manage to give them more than a few listens.  Enter A Dramatic Turn of Events, which I think is their best effort in years!  Whether you loved Portnoy or not, he's gone.  And the drummer they chose to replace him, Mike Mangini, may be a bit different in style, but let's just face the facts -- the man can play.  He keeps up with the other guys very well.  If you can, I would suggest buying the special edition with the DVD because the audition process is pretty cool to watch).  The songs themselves have something that I haven't heard in quite a while, dynamics.  Oh, they rock, don't get me wrong.  But they're not beating us over the head with how heavy they can be.  Starting with Train of Thought, it feltt o me like the band wanted to be Metallica's brainy musical cousin.  But on ADToE, you can hear diversity -- sometimes a sledgehammer, sometimes a light touch -- this is especially true of Petrucci.  He is at his best not when his fingers are constantly flying but when he incorporates all the various styles he has mastered.  I love to hear him go bluesy, jazzy, neo-classical, all in the same solo.  He does more of that kind of stuff on this CD and that is a welcome return to form for me.  Thankfully LaBrie doesn't do his nasally growl voice but goes back to what he does best, which is sing great melodies that punch through the sonic backdrop created by the rest of the band.  In short, with this set of songs under their belt, I may actually venture out and see them live again.  Way to go, guys!

B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|The \\"Firefly\\" movie \\"Serentity\\" was made about 2 years after the series ended.  Its a bit of a sad movie as 2 of our heros die.  But the idea of a small ship thats a family lives on.
B000X9NI5W|5.0|Despite being oft-labeled as the 'godfather' of dubstep, I think Burial's UNTRUE excels not necessarily as a dubstep album, but as a creation of pure atmosphere: the strings and vocal samples of \\"Archangel\\" hint at dark clouds covering a dark sky, and if \\"Near Dark\\" and \\"Ghost Hardware\\" don't differ greatly, they both maintain an ominous -- but also strangely romantic -- feel. Indeed, all over the album, the repurposed soul vocal samples help cast the darkness in cement. Stripped of context, the voices become singular howls of pain, or plaintive calls in the empty spaces that Burial's music creates, becoming another texture: \\"Etched Headplate\\" resists having the 'lyrics' be understandable, consumed as they are beneath the bass, while the momentary piano of \\"In McDonalds\\" echoes the female whisper. The title track, too, hinges on the darkness of telling lies, as brief as that sample is. The sweeping synths and bell tones of the ambient \\"Dog Shelter\\" resonate into the more energetic \\"Homeless,\\" as the layered voices become a chorus. The final track, \\"Raver,\\" goes between the spareness of the rhythm and the fullness of sound. Forget dubstep being all about the wobbly bass -- here, it's all about the atmosphere.
B001EN71CW|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" a tv series in the future taking place after a civil war.  Great example of \\"applied steam punk\\" for those who are into that.  Great story telling- its sad that Fox and SyFy didn't have enough brain cells to make the series work.<br /><br />Suggest you look up \\"Browncoat: Redemption\\" for an excellent fan made movie, with the proceeds going to help 5 different chairites.
B00064X3BI|5.0|I don't want to review the album, if you're looking at a SACD 5.1 mix of it, then I assume you already know what a seminal album it is.  The 5.1 mix is very well done in my opinion.  Just enough in the surround channels to make it interesting.  This isn't the kind of recording that needs to bounce off every corner of the room to make it interesting.  The surround mix is there and well done but, discrete enough not to distract from the original material.
B003UYV08E|5.0|When I saw this film at the theatre, I really didn't enjoy it because I couldn't understand what the actors were saying (they speak too softly at critical points in the plot -- honestly, I think I may be going deaf!), and so some of the characters' motivations were unclear to me.  But because I love the \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Avengers\\" stories, I bought the movie and the subtitles brought better understanding, and a much-improved appreciation of the film.  I didn't buy the two-disk version because I don't care THAT much about how the film was made.  This was good enough for me!
B00008CLOA|5.0|After finally getting a Universal BRP that is capable of playing SACD and DVD-A through HDMI, this was the first disc I acquired.  I have read reviews of the pros and cons of this format and I can honestly say that I couldn't be happier with it!  If you're a fan of the original recording, I can't understand what you would not like about this one.  The 5.1 mix really brings every track to life and I am very much looking forward to the \\"Wish You Were Here\\" version coming out in November 2011.  Now, get to work on \\"Animals\\" guys.

1439192812|5.0|I've been a great admirer of Dawkins' work for a number of years now.  As someone who was born and raised into an evangelical fundamentalist Christian family who was taught the Evolution was a Satanic \\"lie\\", I rejected this dogmatic theology in my late teens and embarked on a years-long mission of self and intellectual discovery.  I embraced the amazing realities of science and reason have been a continuously amazed student of evolutionary biology ever since.  I've ready many great books on evolution, and have recently enjoyed Dawkins' \\"Greatest Show On Earth\\" as a fantastic addition to his library of work.  That being said, The Magic of Reality stands on its own as a magnificent testament to the beauty and majesty of reality - just as it is.  Dawkins masterfully transforms an array of complicated scientific concepts into beautiful and approachable material for the average reader.  Elegantly simple & understandable, yet profoundly effectual at getting the facts across to the reader - this book is a razor sharp instrument in the arsenal of anyone seeking to shed the light of reality, science and truth into a world shrouded in the darkness of superstition, mysticism and fundamentalist religions.  Unlike another masterful work of Dawkins - The God Delusion - this book is far less likely to scare away readers with strong religious convictions.  This book will simply amaze the average reader into questioning ANY beliefs they may have that contradict the rock-solid reality presented in this book.  Its also great middle/high-school material.. just as accessible to any reasonably educated 13-year-old as it is to your own grandmother.  Its written to interest, educate and amaze anyone lucky enough to get their hands on a copy.<br /><br />Purveyors of myth, peddlers of illusion, preachers of fundamentalist doom... BEWARE.  Dawkins just opened another can of reality, and this medicine goes definitely goes down in a most delightful way.

B0052TDGQO|5.0|This is a must have country album. Somewhat tradicional, but still current. Scotty McCreery has a beautiful deep voice, but also a great range. The uptempo songs are a lot of fun and very catchy! The ballads are very emotional. There's not a single bad song in it, and they appeal to all ages and both genders. All and all, one of the best country album ever!!
B005974CNA|5.0|In my opinion, this is DT's best album to date. For multiple reasons. The song writing is strong, the lyrics are much improved. Also, the addition of Mangini has seemed to envoke an enthusiasm and looseness that really comes through in everyone's playing.  They just sound so into it! More than ever before it seems.  Another thing that this album has that I feel has been missing is the raw emotion in the songs.  I feel a connection with this album.  I haven't felt that strong connection since probably Scenes from a Memory.  My favorite track is Breaking All Illusions. Awesome Job!
0553386794|5.0|**Thar be minor spoilers aboard, so be watchful for you HBO TV watchers that have yet to sail this treacherous book.**<br /><br />The land of Westeros is a land of old kings, of ancient magics, storied with many fables and gods; but this story is about lies and deceit, debauchery and a struggle for power that will leave you breathless. Nothing is sacred--no vow and no pledge.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is incredible. A book that passionately explores what drives us and what we will do to achieve all that we desire. Some stop at nothing, and others will lose everything to try and stop them. Who will win? Who is right? And who is playing who?<br /><br />One thing that stands out to me about Martin's work is his prose. He pulls off brevity with beauty and almost never tells you more than you need to know. Many times he tells you less, but he does it wonderfully and it lends a certain confidence, that he trusts you to understand and does not feel the need to lead you by the hand down every turn of the plot or nuance of expression. In turn it becomes a rewarding experience. He always manages to lay out the necessary backstory or foreshadowing so that when the reader reaches a juncture everything is apparent. No long and tedious infodump necessary. Thank you. Most importantly it makes the story read quickly and much is accomplished.<br /><br />The perspective of each character is incredibly effective, making the narration come alive. You feel as if you are walking alongside each character, seeing their strengths and wincing at their weaknesses. Martin does a remarkable job capturing the perspective of the children--more noteworthy to me than the adults because of how well it was done, not because he did any less with the adults. When you read a Brand chapter, it sounds like a young boy, hoping to be more than he is now limited to be; intelligent, wistful of doing more. Sansa is given over to fancy; to being flighty and superficial. Once she realizes the fairy tale is over you can see, as you've always seen, that she is an intelligent girl that lets her expectations, her hopes and her dreams override her better sense. Eddard is of course the idealistic, honor bound, proper-to-a-tee lord that sees too late what is going on all around him and is powerless to save himself. Tyrion is brilliant, flawed and bound to his family no matter how much he has been wronged. So many beautifully wrought characters that live and breathe on these pages. This book is worthwhile to read for that fact alone.<br /><br />I've read somewhere that Martin can accomplish more with his character development in two sentences than others can with pages. And I certainly agree.<br /><br />This is a re-read for me, but I believe for a first reader the story is largely unpredictable. You can enjoy the book from beginning to end, feeling like the author is firmly in control, yet the story takes unexpected turns as Martin makes it feel unique. There is some basic knowledge: You know there is going to be trouble from the North and there will be a blood feud between houses, but besides that the unexpected is the only thing that can be expected.<br /><br />This is a wonderful tale that is expertly told. It may be gory, sexual and wildly inappropriate with rape and more, but it all fits the story without being overly gratuitous and it meshes too well to call it foul. It lends to the story, and the setting nearly demands it, giving a level of realism that has you reeling at times in shock, and then grabbing the book again to continue.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is about politics, it's about human motivation, it's about what drives us down deep and what will we do when pushed to the edge, and what will we do to achieve what we want.<br /><br />There are no true cons. Losing wonderful characters may hurt, but each time it is with meaningful intent to drive the story forward and makes the whole that much stronger and more interesting.<br /><br />The Game of Thrones is fascinating, utterly engrossing and magical. Before I picked it up, I would have never guessed that I would have liked it. Fireballs may never fly, hands are never waived and willpower is never harnessed into magical energy to devastate or mystify, yet the character struggles are so riveting you can't put it down, and you never know what's going to happen as Martin shows you time and again that he pulls no punches. No one is safe, and every hero is at risk.<br /><br />I give Game of Thrones 5 stars of sinister plotting and backstabbing.

No one is safe, and every hero is at risk.    I give Game of Thrones 5 stars of sinister plotting and backstabbing.

B0053TMP24|2.0|I thought that it was a big step down from his other books. Originally they were great, but as he stet he'd everything to the limit, they became boring and badly written. Now Rick is just relying on his past books and the fans who have already read all of them. I didn't like that we were seeing Percy and it wasn't in first person. We've gotten used to being Percy. I also didn't like the quality control on this. There were typos every paragraph. Words got mashed together and split apart to form different, confusing, words. I also though that the plot was empty and dull. The main characters were seemingly invincible. There wasn't mention of cuts and scrapes or bruises or anything, and that made everything dull. You know that none of the main characters would die or even be badly injured. As a Percy Jackson fan, this book was a huge disappointment.
B004DL5K2K|5.0|Sorry for all you Zakk Wylde fans, buy this cd, listen to the playing of a young Randy Rhoads, and face the facts, that this dude was the best guitar player of his time, and dedicated to the craft. Ozzy is great, one heck of a cd.
B005J0VPNC|2.0|This is a great app. My wife has it on her phone. Ever since I first saw it, I've been waiting for it to show up for free. Why wait? My Samsung Galaxy 4g has so little internal memory. Since the market does not tell you if it's moveable,buying an app. is always risky . So, if your phone has limited memory , get it today and uninstall it , then maybe someday when they make it movable,you can reinstall it-that's what I'm doing.
B005J0VPNC|2.0|I love the pictures and it gives a great variety of effects. The major problem (and I'd say it's a pretty major one) is that when I go to look at the neat pictures I just took and I scroll through the gallery, it exits out when I'm scrolling and won't let me see them. Removing app (unfortunately).
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I held out on buying this one in hoped it would be a FAOTD, and look!  hooray. very fun, very easy to use, and an all around great app.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I was very excited to buy this movie, my daughter absolutely loves the movie and we got it in the mail much faster than I expected. The movie was in brand new condition as advertised and my daughter has watched it at least 50 times in the last few weeks since it arrived!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|this is aa very cool app. the effects are amazing, I especially love the perfect pastel filter. I'm not a photography buff, but I know a cool app when I see one. definitely deserves 5 stars.
0439023521|5.0|Let me start by saying I read a LOT.  I go through 3-4 books a week.  As soon as I finish one I start another.  This was not the case with this series.  I read all three books, and as soon as I finished the third all I wanted to do was start them over again, and I never re-read books.  They were amazing.  Everything you could want in a book you will find in these three.  It's the kind of series that really makes you think, and be grateful for the things you have.  I'm not going to go into details, because you can find those by reading the cover, or other reviews, I'll just say that you will NOT be disappointed if you purchase these books.
B001HQZJP2|5.0|good deal, love pirates, kids love it too! came fast, good price, and i trust amazons return policy.  looking forward to use these as a Christmas present for our children.  Looking forward to also using it for entertainment when we have friends over.
B000WGNJ78|5.0|I ordered this cut of the movie in hopes that it was the one WITHOUT the horrible voice over you find in some versions and it was! The movie was in perfect condition and it was delivered the next day. I would definitely reccommend this product.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|rasist policy. u cant buy (u must steal ?) . your country is not allowed... . that's how apple and amazon turns honest customers into pirates .
1609611543|5.0|What a difference this diet has made in my family's life. My mother, who has diabetes (but not celiac), works out every day for at least an hour and hasn't been able to shed the spare tire around her middle. Within a month of cutting back on carbs (but not eliminating them) and quitting wheat, she has significantly reduced that tire, increased her energy, and has dramatically improved her triglycerides. She has really noticed a difference.  What I love about Wheat Belly is that while Dr. Davis recommends going gluten-free, he does not recommend consuming 'gluten-free' foods - most of which are no better than their wheaten counterparts. He does recommend eating foods - real food - that is intrinsically wheat and gluten-free. In that regard his ideas are not dissimilar to those espoused by the Weston A. Price Foundation.  I recommend Wheat Belly to anyone with diabetes, celiac disease, gluten intolerance or any illness caused by metabolic syndrome. Because giving up wheat is a lifestyle change and not a short-term diet or quick-fix, having an underlying medical condition makes it easier to stay wheat-free, though having a condition isn't required! Not everyone who reads the book will be helped by the diet - many people do not have wheat intolerance (or celiac or diabetes etc) and will not benefit from a wheat-free diet. But for those of us who are intolerant or have chronic diet-related diseases, Wheat Belly is a welcome voice in the wilderness!  If you suspect you have celiac disease, you should consider seeing a doctor before embarking on any gluten-free/wheat-free diet. Celiac diagnostic tests are best administered while you are still consuming wheat.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I never thought I'd actually pay for a bundle of 2-minute movie trailer soundtracks featuring overwrought Wagnerian cliches drenched in reverb. But this collection is curiously addictive. It holds up under repeated listens. Great background music for yardwork, workouts or falling asleep to (no kidding).
0385344325|5.0|What's a writer to do when his action hero ages?  One option is to go back in time.  Lee Child's \\"The Affair\\" takes place in 1997, when Major Jack Reacher (his thirty-six year old protagonist and first-person narrator) was an army MP.  Leon Garber, Reacher's commanding officer, sends Jack to Carter Crossing, Mississippi, to monitor a potentially explosive situation.  The body of Janice May Chapman, twenty-seven, has been found with her throat cut.  Since the army has a base in the area, there is reason to suspect that a rogue soldier may have committed this and other grisly crimes.  Although Reacher is a highly skilled and meticulous investigator, Garber makes it clear that under no circumstances should he conduct his own inquiries.  A fellow MP named Duncan Munroe will be on hand to ask the tough questions.  Of course, it is laughable to expect Reacher to sit on the sidelines while Munroe does the heavy lifting.<br /><br />We have long admired Reacher for his intelligence, toughness, passion for justice, and ability to scrutinize the evidence for subtle clues that the average cop would miss.  In addition, he is independent and rarely accepts anyone's word at face value.  As ever, Jack is low-maintenance, carrying no excess emotional or physical baggage. Since he has a clock in his head, what use would he have for a watch?  As the weeks pass, Reacher realizes that the Chapman case has significant political and legal ramifications; he will have to watch his back if he is to emerge unscathed.<br /><br />Lee Child has great fun placing Jack in challenging situations that force him to use his brain power and formidable fighting skills to defeat his opponents.  All work and no play, however, can be frustrating.  Therefore, Jack is delighted to learn that the town's sheriff, Elizabeth Deveraux, a former Marine, is gorgeous and available.  The two gradually get to know one another a little better, but complications ensue that may put a damper on their relationship.<br /><br />Child colorfully depicts life in a rural southern enclave, with its cholesterol-laden food (cheeseburgers, fries, and pies are consumed in alarming amounts), irritating busybodies, and obnoxious louts.  The author's deliciously terse, no-nonsense prose style keeps the story moving briskly.  As usual, Reacher does not rely solely on his impressive combat skills.  He taps into his network of army buddies to unearth vital information and uses old-fashioned legwork and sharp analysis to unravel a mystery that he was never meant to solve.  Child keeps us turning pages with scenes of violent confrontations, a torrid romance, a juicy murder probe, and an intriguing back story that explains why Reacher left the army so suddenly to become a solitary wanderer.life in a rural southern enclave, with its cholesterol-laden food (cheeseburgers, fries, and pies are consumed in alarming amounts), irritating busybodies, and obnoxious louts.

B005J0VPNC|3.0|has some neat effects, would be near perfects if it did video, then I'de make my own Take on Me video  the contrast, brightness and lines controls are a little hard to adjust though.  one outher issue is I can only access one of main rear camera and not the front facing ones, being able to tern on or off the camera flash would be nice too.   you can alter existing photos so those thing are not a huge deal
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I don't have much words to spill on the matter, other than that George Lucas has stated that he would continue to work on his space saga, and has done so several times.  He trimmed them when he released the 1997 Special Editions, and made further changes to releases in 2001, 2004 and 2006. With the new Blu-Ray format, he once again made changes, which he, again, predicted. He clearly stated he would make another batch of changes with the creation of the next film format (which turned out to be Blu-Ray).    Whether or not he will one day realize that the best-selling Blu-Ray item of all time could be surpassed only by the Original Theatrical Edition, which he would of course have to release himself as well, remains to be seen. I'm not losing any sleep over it.    Everyone knows that the internet has alternatives to offer. They offered me the theatrical set. I already bought the 2004 dvd set, and now the Complete Saga Blu-Ray set as well.  I have what I need, and so does George Lucas.  Time to face the facts. He will very likely not release the Original Trilogy. If he does, it will probably quadruple his millionaire stature overnight. If he doesn't, tough break.    In the meantime, head on over to [...] who work closely with Amazon (they link their purchase buttons to Amazon), to read a PROFESSIONAL review of the audio/video quality.  [...]

B0036TGT3E|5.0|Lion King is and always be my favorite Disney film. Yeah Toy Story was great but I consider that Pixar (was made before disney and Pixar merged). So when I heard \\"The Lion King\\" was being released on BluRay I knew I had to get it and man was I ever right. The picture is perfect. I mean when this film was first released in 1994, the picture was near perfect and now in HD it is perfect.<br /><br />Now I didnt get the 3D bluray because I dont have a 3D tv, but I heard the 3D scenes werent that good anyway. For the price you cannot beat a disney classic. I mean the scenes. I mean who can forget the famous \\"What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?......HULA!\\"<br /><br />This film had a great sotry and epic songs written by Elton John.<br /><br />And Oh...the special features. We get a ton of them.<br /><br />-Commentary:<br />-Deleted and Extended scenes: 2 of which are new songs<br />-The morning report extended scene: This should've been in the above one but it wasnt, this had Zazu singing about the morning report while Simba is getting a puncing lesson<br />-Bloopers: They used I believe actual bloopers during recordings and made them cartoons.<br />-Lion King Memoir: A kind of a behind the scenes kind of deal<br />-Pride of the Lion King: another documentary, but with the artist and a discussion with Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick<br />-Interactive features: Look at some artwork<br />-Second screen: Link your Ipad, IPhone or Laptop to see certain artwork and facts during the film.<br />-Timon and Pumba discuss 3D<br />-Sing a long mode<br /><br />This is the perfect bluray for any Lion King lover. There is not a single bad thing about it. Buy<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Perfect HD picture<br />-Tons of special features<br />-Favorite disney film ever<br />-Price<br />-One word...\\"HULA!\\"<br />-Story<br />-Songs<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Uh...can you think of any
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This app is great out how to suggest it to anyone who wanted to have fun with a camera phone
B005J0VPNC|3.0|There are really about three different filters here, mixed and tweaked in various ways. It's fun to play with, but after a few uses this gets kind of old. The app itself seems solid enough.
0439023521|5.0|I have to say I was leery when I picked up this book. In my defense YA fiction has become tiring of late. You can go into the section in any Barnes & Nobel and it's basically vampires on one side, werewolves on the other (thank you Stephanie Meyer). But this book isn't anything like what's on the shelves right now. All I can say is: Wow.    There are some plot flaws but you don't even notice them because you're so wrapped up in the story. The characters are all great and well written, especially the heroine Katniss. She isn't a damsel in distress and I bet she'd punch me for even suggesting that she could be. She's smart, resourceful, caring, and, most of all, a survivor. You really root for her and for Peeta who is so kind that you can't help but love him. None of the characters are caricatures which is really an accomplishment. The reactions are realistic and the suspense is almost non-stop. The plot is original and there is just the right amount of description so you can imagine the gore of the games but it doesn't sicken you.    I read this book for the first time almost two months ago and I'm still raving about it. It's just fantastic.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is rugged, durable and flexible.  It holds my camera, lenses, filters, batteries and all my gear when I go out to take pictures.  I take soccer pictures of my child and her friends and like to have all my gear for changing conditions and this bag fits the bill.  The camera stores have bags that are smaller and more expensive but not better quality than this one.  Pricewise it is a STEAL!  Half the price of the name brand bags and 1.5 times the space, or more.  I absolutely love it and would recommend it to other photographers, which I have.  Absolutely LOVE it.
0439023513|4.0|I think it's hard for all readers to come to the end of a great series of books. You want it to be perfect and for everything to work out just as you think it should; for the entire journey that you've been on with the main character to wrap up in a neat little package. But I think from reading (actually the more correct word would probably be devouring) the first two books of The Hunger Games trilogy it was easier for me to accept that there couldn't be a cookie-cutter ending.   However, as an avid reader, I did have some issues with this last book. I'll list the two that I felt were the most disappointing: The first is Katniss as a character. In the other books, especially the first one, she is smart and very active but in this book she is lacking. Again she is the pawn of the government (this time District Thirteen) but she never really strategizes or rebels against that until the end. She's a static character in this book and that made me sad when I compared her to the Katniss in the first and second book. The second issue I have would be with last chapter (not the epilogue) of the book. To me, it felt like Collins just wanted to be done with the entire thing. It was sloppy and really lacked feeling.     While it was my least favorite book in the trilogy Mocking Jay kept me up all night until I had finished reading it, which, in my opinion, is the sign of a good book.
B00197POXG|5.0|I love this item! Just as described. The tie on the sturdy box is strong and so is the box. I read reviews that said the string was not good and the box was flimsy. NOT SO!! The box is strong cardboard and looks very nice on display. Even the dvd's are well protected inside their folder. Very happy with this purchase and the price! Even had the movies!
B005J0VPNC|1.0|I downloaded this app for the Verizon's Droid Eris and it's absolutely worthless. When you open the app, you just get a blank dark screen and the phone seizes up completely. Like another Droid Eris user posted previously (should have listened to him...lol) I had to take the battery out to get it working again and uninstall the app. Too bad, because I was looking forward to playing with this app. I hope the developer works on this app further to include a version that works with the Droid Eris.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Title says it all - Fast Five is an incredibly fun and exciting movie. So many great chase scenes and witty back-and-forth between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. If you're a fan of the series - this will be your favorite yet. If not - this will be one of your favorite action movies. The movie was very well done, and there's a nice little surprise at the very end of the credits (at least there was in theaters!)
B005CAAVVQ|4.0|I am a new fan, having discovered TS with his last album Backatown.  This new CD is pure high-voltage funk from start to finish.  It would be a great party record.  Personally, I prefer the slightly more mellow and varied Backatown, but this is a great record to pump you up on your morning drive, or celebrate the weekend, yeah!  Vocals are all good.  Ledisi's appearance is a high point.  I am not a particular fan of Kid Rock but his appearance on this CD does not bother me - not awesome but not terrible either.  Troy Andrews is himself a pretty good vocalist.  The musicians on this album seem to be having a great time doing what they love.  You couldn't ask for much more.
B001B93H0O|5.0|new package of zumba dvd's came very quickly, as described the dvd's are for beginners to power exercise. The instructors in the beginning dvd go thru the steps very slowly and repeat the steps a few times so anybody can get it and then put all the steps together.  The instruction is in both english and spanish but its not annoying and does not take away from getting the workout you want. Once you get the steps and the music starts it's alot of fun...at least I thought so!
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Transformers Dark of the Moon is a thrill ride from start to finish!Dark of the Moon has the most compelling storyline of all three.I have been a transformers fan since the beginning in the 1980's and have loved every minute of comedy,romance, and thrilling action in all three films.Sam gets a new girlfriend in Carly and is ready for some more action instead of the daily grind.The shadow side of the moon holds a secret that will change both decepticon and autobot forever.I would have loved to see Megan fox in the third installment as well,but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley does just as good of an acting job to make the movie awesome all around.If you are a true transformer fan you will love Dark of the Moon along with the other two as well.Transformers Dark of the Moon has all of the amazing transformer characters with new weapons that are the coolest.The special effects are some of the best you will ever see,with some of the most kick-ass battle scenes to blow your mind.Bottom line Transformers Dark of the Moon is a 10 out of 10 DVD experience that will please any true transformer fan around.I highly recommend Dark of the Moon along with Transformers,and Revenge of the Fallen.Transformers Rule!!!

B0006GANN2|1.0|The picture of the product with Gene Hackman on the cover of the jewel case IS NOT what I received.  All I got was the movie in a blank jewel case.  Isn't that false advertising?
0811875040|5.0|Very nice cookbook. Came in on time. Instructions are clear, and the pictures are very enticing. Could possibly inspire those who don't bake, into baking.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I <3 lovestrong! The songs are real and made of the grit of a person who wanted to be an artist, not someone who was raised to become one because their record dealers thought the public would appreciate trash. 'Jar of Hearts' is an instant grabber, powerful and strong and real and true. Still my favorite song even though I bought the CD and others a while ago. 'Miles' is great to dance to (I know from experience) and 'Arms' is a great song, which I really adore. 'Bluebird' is sweet and a wonderful song to sing along to. Overall, 9/10 of the songs are extremely cherishable! Love, love, love!!!
B00406UK7S|3.0|This is a movie that deserved better ratings than it got.  For some the Roman Army in Britain might be a boring subject, but it's an interesting take on the fate of the Ninth Hispana.  Read \\"Eagle of the Ninth\\" to get a feel for what the story is about
0399215980|5.0|I have 20 month twins.  They like to read book.  So I bring some book for travel and go out dinning.  The book is apporopriate to carry somewhere.  First of all, it is handy size.  I can put my purse!  Second, very beautiful color as same as other \\"Eric's book\\", so my kids are love to read even though they already read many times.   Finally,  not so expensive.  All of the reasons, I want to buy other his handy books also.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I just got the zoom about two weeks ago and it works perfectly for me. Once I snapped it on all I had to do was re-calibrate my Kinect and it works beautifully. I'm not sure why so many are having problems with it but as for me I haven't had a single issue with zoom.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|If you saw the trailers you already know our main characters have been raised since infancy in an institution which provides organs for transplants. Is that upsetting enough for you? This is a horror film with very little blood and is a poignantly romantic film with very little sex.<br /><br />We see the gentle methods used to raise and educate these passive children, consequently we are not surprised to see that they are childlike even as adults. Why have them feel agitated when eventually they comprehend the reality of their horrific situation?<br /><br />There is a telling episode where two chums take our three main characters into a \\"normal\\" village. They don't know how to cross a street or order a meal. They cluster together like a gaggle of geese. It would be funny if it weren't so sad.<br /><br />This stellar cast is anchored by:<br />*  Carey Mulligan (\\"An Education\\"), who is the odd girl out in what becomes a romantic triangle;<br />*  Keira Knightley (\\"The Duchess\\") gets the boy;<br />*  Andrew Garfield (\\"The Social Network\\"), is wrenchingly effective as the man-boy who is the object of their affections.<br /><br />Even though this is beautifully shot and well acted, I had a devil of a time hearing their murmured dialogue. My DVD from Amazon.com is much, much better, because there are captions. Now I get to see Garfield's wonderful performance again.
B005SAY404|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would be watching this season after the torture of watching the last half of last season.  I decided to give this premiere a try and I am glad I did.  It is just House and no one does it better than Hugh Laurie.  Good solid episode to get back in the game.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Well, THAT was the most fun I've had in a movie in a long, long time! This thing is intricately plotted, perfectly photographed, and extremely well cast! Although there was little or no profanity and no sweaty bodies, we did see a lot of gunfire, car chases and blowie uppie stuff. The audience ate it up!<br /><br />First, let's talk about that cast:<br />*  Bruce Willis (\\"Cop Out\\") is a former CIA black-ops agent, now he's Retired, Extremely Dangerous...get it? He's trying to deal with boredom and inertia, and has taken to calling a particular gal in a call center about a check he keeps insisting never arrived.<br />*  Mary-Louise Parker (\\"Weeds\\") is that gal (see above). She reads bodice-rippers like Love's Savage Fury and dreams of having a manly man come into her life and sweep her away to excitement, passion and exotic locales. She is hilarious!<br />*  Morgan Freeman (\\"Invictus\\") is another retired agent, now relegated to a nursing home where he is dealing with a terminal illness. He too, is bored and lonely; this is NOT the way he expected his life to end.<br />*  John Malkovich (\\"Secretariat\\") is also part of this bunch. He spent a few years being injected with LSD, so his hold on reality is a bit shaky, but he LOVES guns, ammo and explosives! Talk about a loose cannon!<br />*  Helen Mirren (\\"The Last Station\\") isn't quite as retired as her buddies; she admits she still \\"takes a side job or two.\\" She can wield a machine gun with the best of them and still packs a yen for an agent she had to shoot.<br />*  Ernest Borgnine (\\"SpongeBob SquarePants\\") should have retired years ago, but he's still working in the CIA's top-top-secret archives.<br />*  Richard Dreyfuss (\\"My Life in Ruins\\") is an industrialist who knows WHY a mysterious list was made of people who MUST die.<br />*  Karl Urban (\\"Star Trek\\") is absolutely perfect as a new-generation black-ops agent, every bit as well trained and deadly as his predecessors. I'm always impressed by him.<br /><br />This terrific film was beautifully directed by Robert Schwentke (\\"The Time Travelers's Wife\\") and I could hardly wait to get my DVD from Amazon.com. When every scene is deliciously shot, with guts, glamor and LOTS of giggles, we naturally look to the director. Let's keep an eye out for this guy, okay?rrific film was beautifully directed by Robert Schwentke (\\"The Time Travelers's Wife\\") and I could hardly wait to get my DVD from Amazon.com.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|This involving and fascinating film is the story (and the trial) that surrounds the development of the social phenomenon, Facebook. I got my DVD the moment Amazon.com notified me it was available.  We start in 2003 (was it that recent?) as we watch Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg clumsily derail a potential date. He is brilliant, thoughtless and socially incompetent (maybe a touch of Asperger's?). Oblivious to the hurt he inflicts in that perfectly fine young woman, his first on-line venture springs from his desire to strike back at her.  This perfectly cast film boasts the following characters:  *  Jesse Eisenberg (\\"Zombieland\\") IS Zuckerberg: smart, ambitious and emotionally isolated.  *  Andrew Garfield (\\"Boy A\\") is perfect as his patient and much-exploited roommate and would-be friend. It looks like this guy might be our new Spiderman in 2012...  *  Roonie Mara (\\"Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" US version, 2011) is that unfortunate date.  *  Armie Hammer (TV credits) is amazing as the conflicted Winklevoss twins; Harvard gentlemen don't sue other Harvard gentlemen just for stealing an idea. He (they) look like taller versions of young Prince William.  *  Justin Timberlake (\\"Alpha Dog\\") is Sean Parker, the founder of Napster, who wants a piece of the action.  *  John Getz (Lots of TV) is Zuckerberg's lawyer. I'm only including him because I've liked him ever since \\"Blood Simple.\\"  A lot of the action takes place on a college campus, so we see stereotypical parties, drug use and general misbehavior which is mostly ignored by our computer hacker/nerd, Zuckerberg. The contrast is nicely depicted by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (\\"Charlie Wilson's War\\") and director David Fincher (he'll be doing the American version of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\"). There is plenty of humor because we have 20/20 hindsight and KNOW what happened with Facebook. The tagline for this movie is: You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.  Once again, we are treatedto snippets of what happened after the trial which is central to the film. I always appreciate that!

If you have not had that experience you will get to read the invoice info in the book. Fabulous stuff. The turn of events was an interesting peek into human behavior. The generosity was honorable. I will pass this book on!
0763644765|5.0|I have purchased other books to inspire my 2 year old grandaughter to use the potty but this is the first that has gotten her to talk about it out loud and think how it all works. I love how it shows that the kitty and the doggie also go potty certain places too.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|born this way speaks out so much, not only for some people, but there is something in there for everyone. money well spent.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|pretty cool app - and yes, this version allows you to do effects in your gallery pics.  i just tried it and it worked like a charm.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|I take a lot of pics with my EVO 4G and this just adds to my toys for fun &amp; posts!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I LOVE how well my pictures came out. :-) This app is legitly AMAZING! I'm sooooooooooo glad that it's the FAOTD!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The product was in excellent condition and with good package. I'm totally satisfied. I recomend this item for purchase and I'm waiting for the next season.
B005J0VPNC|1.0|I've downloaded this app thinking it would be oh-hum but in reality it's been pretty fun. I've been taken pictures and changing my already existing photo gallery.   Ph: Optimus V
B005J0VPNC|1.0|suppose to be free app of the day but wont download, telling me I have to pay for it first
B005G0YP3C|5.0|I lived in a house where playing hippie music was not allowed so you if can imagine a 14 year old kid listening to an album hidden under the stairs of his parents house with a cheap Juliette stereo and a record that just came out telling you that you & your friends are going to go their separate ways after college and you are still in junior high school. Now that was a lesson I never forgot and they were right! Now the album sounds better than ever with some of the most innovative songwriting, vocal loops before their time, killer before funk, funky bass lines. If you wonder where most people stole it from, look no further and accept no substitute. Gentle Giant, the best band ever!
B005J0VPNC|4.0|great and fun app but it was offered as the freebie just a short time ago.  can't be so desperate for apps that you have to recycle oldies but goodies already?<br />btw this is a great app that has run flawlessly on my htc tbolt running stock unrooted android 221
B005G0YP3M|5.0|I have listened to this record since the week it came out 7 it is classic Gentle Giant. The sound here is the best ever and thing you tough were distorted guitars are now low synthesizer patches. Track #7 might even be the best Gentle Giant song ever and will remind you of old friends come and gone. A must own really!
B0041CGP02|5.0|This is a great album -- one of Bon Jovi's best.  The CDs came in a great package and in perfect condition.  I would recommend this to all the Bon Jovi fans everywhere.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|It would get 5 stars if it supported my front facing camera! Insert words to meet the minimum word limit!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Sammy and the boys strike again! I'm really enjoying this cd. It is more polished than their first outing or maybe its just that the guys have grown closer knit and more comfortable with each other. Either way all of these guys despite their age are some of the best in the business and are having fun showing that they still have the stuff. There is some really good rocking going on here no doubt about it. This release is much better than 97% of whats been released in the genre so far this year, and ChickenFoot are making their mark. These guys are probably the most sucessfull  super group  yet to date. Sammys great voice is still in form despite his age and he still is feeling his youth. Noone can argue with Joes guitar playing , hes allways been one of the best. Mikey shows that he can harmonize and is still pounding that bass ! While Chad , well cudos to him I believe that he is really now getting to show just how talented that he is on drums. So smooth and effortlessly looking.     Go Chickenfoot !!!!  No sophmore slump here.
B004ZNARH4|1.0|What a poorly packaged mess!  This is an item meant for collectors, only there is nothing inside worth collecting.   For $110 you could have included a nice dank joint, or at least some Dark Side of the Moon Rolling Papers.  For $110 you could have included copies of the CDs that weren't all scratched up from the idiotic design of this package. 4 unprotected CD's on the bottom and 2 more disks in cardboard sleeves = totally thoughtless Morons were involved. Big Surprise.  Yay! A Really Lame Scarf! Again, I think I'm offended. You should pay me $110 to take this lousy scarf off your hands.  Neato Mosquito! Cheapo Chinese Marbles. You say you're not sure what to do with them? Come here, Bend over. I'll put them right where they belong. ...Because I remember sitting in the schoolyard playing marbles and listening to Dark Side of the Moon, Umm huh.  This is the appreciation I get for being a lifelong fan??  I don't appreciate it, thanks.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|It's very interesting reading the reviews of all these so called \\"Critics\\". The movies are done for the viewers, not for critics. It is simple as that. This is an action movie which i enjoyed very, very much as well as the first two. Visual Effects and Transformers scenes are larger than any other and if the critics didn't like the movie, so be it with it. If it's such a bad moview as they said, how is it possible that it made more than $1B in screenings??
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Since I downloaded this before it was free. It was cute, and sometimes it made my picture look pretty cool. It was limited, and the options got boring for me after a while. Certain settings are pretty finicky and don't work on every picture. All in all, it was still a decent app. Not something I'd pay for, but certainly worth trying if it's free.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is really good.  The group is obviously getting along and having a good time.  They played hit after hit and many of the song sounded better that the original recordings.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|To me, this is the album of our generation. It speaks for us and about us. There is so much more to it than catchy beats like some of her previous work on The Fame and earlier. The whole thing is just so deep and meaningful, it is about everything we need to talk about. Everything we need to get across to our Government and to other people who are holding us back. She is our voice; the vehicle of our thoughts and of our words that always seem to be forgotten and pushed aside. This album sets us free.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Incredibly well written....kudos to Mr. Sorkin and of course the brilliant casting! I've noticed many complaints on the discs being scratched....I checked almost all discs....no scratches whatsoever.
B00000IL67|5.0|With all the positive buzz surrounding Welcome 2 My Nightmare which I rate Alice's best album in a very long time, I had to dig out his landmark 1999 boxset to hear all over again.  I hadn't listened to it in a long time but after recently playing it again, it holds up as the most comprehensive career boxset ever!  It is a shame that Rhino pulled it out of print domestically but it is available as an import.  There are a lot of great boxsets out there but in terms of visually stunning artwork and packaging, (mine has the limited 3-D run Alice image) great liner notes and essays, as well as all the hits, including single versions, key album cuts, rare cuts and B-sides, soundtrack songs, and cool collaborations, absolutely nothing comes close to touching The Life And Crimes Of Alice Cooper. Get it either as an import or look for a used domestic release in excellent condition and you won't be disappointed!
0634022296|5.0|It has most of the songs - I was looking for Mr. Moonlight, but will get it off the web and clip it into the book. I am very hally with it and will be enjoying it for years to come!
0375413405|5.0|Mastering the Art of French Cooking is an incredible cookbook.  You really should own volume one and two.  You won't be disappointed.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Beautiful colors and music, my son enjoyed the entire movie and so did i.  The story was very well laid out and interesting.  Overall, the music and the comic relief was pretty good.
0394721772|5.0|What more can I say?  The title of the book says it all.  A must have cookbook for any cook.
0316069884|5.0|I saw this book on a shelf a couple weeks ago, and walked past it as I assumed it was, what I used to loosely semi-jokingly term \\"Nazi Vegan PETA Preachers\\". After all, I have been a proud omnivore my entire life and didn't feel like having someone else \\"preach\\" to me. This book was \\"staff recommended\\" and had a little blurb about \\"This book changed my life, etc etc\\".  I skimmed over most of what they wrote (see my \\"proud omnivore\\" comment above), but was fixated on the very last line:  \\"I dare you to read this book\\".<br /><br />So what did I do?  I walked away.<br /><br />After a few moments, I walked back and stated reading the back of the cover.<br /><br />Then I walked away ... again.<br /><br />Then I walked back ... again.  This time I chose to buy it. After all, what could it hurt to read a book, right?<br /><br />To say this book altered the way I viewed my world was an understatement. The author was fantastic and I appreciated the fact that he kept his \\"preachiness\\" to a minimum, instead offering lots of data, first hand accounts, and lots of throught provoking questions.<br /><br />I laughed, I cried, I was outraged, I was shocked, and I was shamed.  Most of all, my eyes were opened.  You see, I spent summers growing up on my grandparent's farm.  I already \\"knew\\" what farming was about, or so I thought.  However what \\"farming\\" is, and what \\"factory farming\\" is, are entirely different beasts. Our culture (and desires) have changed so radically that what I thought was normal was so far from the truth that I can't believe I was this clueless. Or maybe I just didn't want to think too hard about where my neat little packaged meat came from, how it was raised, slaughtered, and more importantly how it was processed.<br /><br />When I turned the last page of this book, I made the conscious choice to never again be a willing participant to this kind of lifestyle \\"norm\\" again just for the sake of food, and I was reduced to 2 sentences that might sound eerily familiar:<br /><br />\\"This book changed my life\\" and \\"I dare you to read this book\\".ook\\".
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Sweet app of the day, doors what it says. You can convert old photos that you have. can't complain other then it's a little slow but still give it a five star rating
0070511136|3.0|SPIN Selling makes a compelling case against agressive selling techniques and closing catchphrases.<br />It underlines the proccess that big account representatives must follow to understand and act on the needs of the customers.<br />Although it is great for complex value offerings it also states clearly that basic closing techniques are the most appropiate for fast selling basic products.<br /><br />On the downside the book expands too much on the statistics behind the model and try to fill space with the same info in another context.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|This entire album moves. I have trouble picking a favorite song because they are all so amazing. The music has power and meaning. Give it a few listens and it'll grab onto your heart and will never let go.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|i was really excited to see this as the free app of the day cuz i was actually looking to purchase it. I've been messing with it now for a little bit and it's great! the ability to be able to use pictures from MY OWN GALLERY is awesome and will more than likely use it all the time.
0142419400|5.0|Have you ever felt that fuzzy feeling in the pit of your stomach when someone special walks through the door or the feeling of your heart pounding in your chest when this special someone speaks? You'll have that feeling within every few pages you read. You can't help but fall in love with this novel.<br /><br />Every aspect of the book was real right down to each vibrant character. It was detailed so well that it gives the reader a one-way ticket to France and the only way they'll leave is when they put the book down and on top of that I don't think you'd one to.<br /><br />The story follows Anna as she is sent to France by her writer dad to finish her senior year in high school. As things escalate Anna falls for her best friend who is taken and the readers find themselves feeling everything she is from the denial of her feelings for him to her acceptance of it. She is a character that makes the reader feel like someone you really know. She's ambitious, determined and extremely knowledgeable when it comes to movies that the reader actually learns a few things from her.<br /><br />Every event in the leads to another and is everything that happens in a teenage girls life. The drama, the fights with her friends, the feuds with the family, and the love that's shared between family, friends and friends you'd like to have as lovers. Every emotion and happening is perfectly described and illustrated.<br /><br />The book was extremely easy to read and the moment I began the book I was already laughing out loud and you've got to hand it to the author for being able to write something that hooks you into the story right from the start.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is by far the best teen romance book I've ever read. Stephanie Perkin's is the modern Jane Austen. I tip my hat to her excellence!
B005OUARUO|4.0|I sampled all of 3 songs before purchasing and deciding that \\"it's Feist, what can go wrong?\\" I wasn't quite sure what to expect given the up-beat flavour of The Reminder.<br /><br />The album is much closer to the slower paced Let it Die. I don't foresee any radio hits due to slow nature of the songs (While I've listened for several hours I'm often up and about so I could be missing a song or so). Since the mellow songs are one of the reasons I enjoy Feist this is not a negative. My personal favorite song is \\"Caught a Long Wind\\"<br /><br />So all in all, if you liked Let it Die you have a high chance of liking this one. If you didn't like Let it Die you probably won't.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|I paid for this 2 months ago n and now its free come on amazon this is getting lame repeat apps that were already free app of the day and now putting apps people already paid for . For free you should give us our money back and this app still needs to be updated
1400049628|4.0|Purchased this as \\"airplane\\" reading.    Started reading it at the airport and almost missed the call for my flight.  Slightly more practical than \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\\"
B003ZMF26W|5.0|I purchased this item on the 3 and received it the afternoon of the 5 as promised. The packaging was secure with no damage to any of the items.  The mouse feels great to use so far, and from just poking around with the software for a few minutes it seems rather easy to figure out. Definitely a good gaming mouse at a good price  Recommend
0740748475|5.0|I have always loved Calvin and Hobbes and this set is pretty amazing. I love the introduction about Bill Watterson, it really gives an insight into why he didn't want to exploit Calvin and Hobbes through merchandising. It's a heavy collection, probably not meant for casual reading, but I read it every day anyway. All Calvin and Hobbes fans MUST BUY.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|Installed flawlessly on my V-Mobile Samsung Intercept. I was dismayed to see there is no App2SD support (hence the 4 stars). That limits this camera's worth, at least to me.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's really only got three effects I use. 1) Comic Boom. 2) Acquarello (watercolor in Italian), and 3) Bleaching.<br /><br />Another issue that I had was that it didn't allow you to open pictures that you had already taken with another app. I see that this has been resolved in this iteration. I will uninstall and re-install from here right away.
B00536OCZA|5.0|I'm a bit amazed to read all the reviewers who experienced subpar quality of the vinyl. The copy that I bought from Amazon.co.uk is as pristine as one wishes, in a poly sleeve, no scratches or scuffs whatsoever, i.e. as clean as they come. When playing (with my hypersensitive Ortofon 2M Bronze on a high end Nottingham Ace Spacedeck), there is almost no surface noise, no ticks or pops. As my copy is pressed in the EU (indicated on the LP label), I'm wondering whether the copies that Amazon.com customers bought and complain about might not have been pressed by a EMI licensed company in the USA, the reverse having happened with the recent 45RPM vinyl remasters of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours -- the EU version had been pressed in Europe based on digital files rather than on the proper master tapes used for the US edition, which unsurprisingly is far superior in sound than the European one.  As to the DSOTM vinyl, I'd recommend ordering a copy from Amazon UK.  Edit: I just noticed that indeed the copies sold on Amazon.com are of US origin - see the editorial review on this page (and below)--- so go and buy from Amazon.co.uk to have a genuine audiophile experience  >>Editorial Reviews  U.S. vinyl LP pressing. Digitally remastered Discovery Edition of this classic 1970 album from the British Rock legends. With this beautifully remastered version, it's time to discover Pink Floyd all over again!<<
1593080719|3.0|Vanity Fair is about the adventures of the young Becky Sharp, born to humble circumstances but given certain opportunities to raise herself, which she takes full advantage of, sometimes to her benefit, more often to her detriment. As heroine's go...well...she isn't one, hence the book's subtitle, \\"A Novel Without a Hero\\". It is written as social satire. For a man fully entrenched in Victorianism, the early part of the century provided a great deal of fodder for novel material. But there's nothing funny about it. The Napoleanic War, the fight for Social survival, the harsh realities of a class system, and thrown into this is the avaricious and scheming Becky Sharp, who takes advantage, and with a realism that at times persuades the reader to sympathise with her. In her path, however, she leaves a wake of ruin. Sympathies change, though, as the book progresses, and while, at first, we may have rooted for one non-heroine, by the end, we are rooting for quite another. The book has a happy-ish ending, with a sobering monologue to put all in its place and to cast a shade of reality over it. But one is left, at the conclusion, with the impression that Thackeray rather tired of his characters before he had quite completed his novel. Overall, it was an interesting look into a Victorian gentleman's view of the decades before him, but it is not by any means one of my favourite books of the era.
0316098329|2.0|This is by far the WORST book I ever read! The story is not believable,nor is the first person language.How it ever got a publisher is amazing.
1612930441|5.0|Oscar Wilde's only novel is, in my opinion, his greatest work. While the plays spark with wit and wisdom, with humour and satirical fun, Dorian Gray is of another class entirely. It is a serious look at the consequences of immorality, of vanity and greed and selfishness. And it does not flinch to paint the 'picture' in all of its gory details. It's contemporary today, as proved by a recent film adaptation (starring the drool-worthy Ben Barnes) which was quite accurately adapted from the book and is, to my mind, required reading. Or should be.
B004GFGUAY|5.0|Amazing collaboration between Danger Mouse, that Italian guy, Norah Jones, and Jack White. Nothing else like it. Reminded me of the movie \\"The Good, Bad, and the Ugly,\\" and later found out that was on purpose, which speaks to the quality of the project. Kind of like a double blind drug test. Genre bending, it is just cool all around. Strings, vocals, drums, sound great. Who else could think of a soundtrack for a movie that doesn't exist? If a movie does get made it will pale in comparison to the soundtrack. Maybe Jack White vs. Danger Mouse and Norah Jones as the double crosser. A musical battle, like the cowboy version of 8 Mile.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|This movie was fantastic.  It was a bummer having to use the subtitles to understand most of it, as I dont speak much spanish, but I enjoyed the film none the less.  My husband reads the book series this was made from and he was SO excited to get this movie and to watch it.  Loved it.
B005974CNA|5.0|I got the CD, listened to it the first time, I was worried. Second time, felt better. Now I cannot believe how good this is. Same experience with all their albums, they are so good that your brain cant understand all this coded messages the first try, but then after some listening you are hooked and transported to places where you feel like flying, crying, etc. This only happens with Dream Theater´s music, and yes, this album delivers it.  Cant stop listening to it. Thanks DT, your music goes beyond anything that I have heard before in my life. I need a dose of this every one or two years, please keep on recording !
B00000JLWW|4.0|I looked for this at Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc, and the only place I could find this was on Amazon.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|this sucks i paid for this yesterday and now its free. i want one crisp dollar and 99 new coins or im boycotting something
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is a complete weather app. It's pretty accurate and covers everything.  Plus the widget graphics are great and I love the interface.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|this app has a lot of neat filters that i haven't seen on other camera apps. this is probably my favorite one out of the ones i have tried. the camera lags at times but it could be my phone's problem and not the app. give it a try!
B004NSULHM|5.0|Thom Yorke recently said in an interview that he was \\"bored with melody.\\"  That said, we should first at least appreciate the fact that 7 of these songs are very melodic, and then quit complaining about the rest.  For as strange and off-putting as TKOL may be at first, it's still much more accessible than it might've been if Thom and company had had no restraints at all.<br /><br />I also don't feel it's fair to rate this album based on the band's previous work.  There seems to be two different types of Radiohead fans: those that only like their \\"rock\\" albums, and those that like both their rock and alternative/electronic/experimental albums.  If you fall in the former category, you might not allow yourself to warm up to this work.<br /><br />The first two times I heard TKOL were in my car.  I was underwhelmed, and a little disappointed.  I then listened to it with my headphones at home, and was completely blown away by what I was hearing; the closeness that headphones permit seemed to let the album unfold and reveal all the subtleties I had missed earlier in my car.  This album is about layers, and it's all the more interesting when you hear how they fit together.<br /><br />Forget a typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus song structure; although some songs oblige this format, some just do what they want, when they want. That doesn't mean there aren't hooks, because there are plenty actually.  You might just have to give it a few listens is all, warm up to what you're hearing.<br /><br />This album is not only catchy, it is just incredibly interesting.  It has a dark side to it, like most Radiohead albums.  The lyrical content is fascinating too, and seems mostly to do with nature, finding beauty and mystery in the undisturbed world around ourselves.<br /><br />I think most people who would consider themselves a \\"fan\\" of Radiohead will like this album.  I'd say give it a couple listens through some regular stereos to first familiarize yourself with it, and then put on some headphones.
B0006ZE7G2|3.0|I have loved this movie for a great deal of time and decided to upgrade to DVD after the demise of my VCR.  I was shocked, after ordering this DVD, that the packaging was different than my college roomate's 25th anniversary copy of the wall.  His looks like it is in a real DVD case, and mine appears to be a low-impact environmentally friendly piece of garbage.  I mean, the movie is what I really care about, but it just doesn't fit comfortably in my DVD rack.  Perhaps this packaging information was written somewhere on the site and I missed it -- oh the problems of purchasing in haste...  Had I seen it in person, however, I would have put it back on the sales rack.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Forget what you think you know about movies or film-making, or how a film should be made.  In order to enjoy this, you have to leave all your expectations of convention at the door.  The Tree of Life is more than just a movie, and I mean that in the most literal way possible: it is expression through film, a work of art, a piece of music, a visual odyssey, and more than anything, a philosophical meditation. It does not have a plot in the conventional sense and there is no obvious conflict-resolution so to speak.  Because the film is not even aiming to accomplish either of these, I don't think it's fair to give it a bad rating for not doing so; it's just not the point Malick had in mind.<br /><br />It may help to consider that for a good portion of Malick's life, he was a philsophy professor at MIT.  This is a man who thinks...a lot.  He's concerned with the big ideas: the meaning of life, the origin of life, questions about God, questions about nature, beauty, art, and so on.  If you are interested in these things too, you might love this movie; if not, you will probably hate it and find it very boring.<br /><br />I watched it in the theater twice.  The music together with the visuals is what really got me.  More than anything, this film is impressionistic.  It's a personal, subjective experience, and invites the viewer to consider our deepest questions through the art of film.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Installed the drivers in XP, plugged it in, every just worked.  Happy that I chose this product for my serial to usb needs.
B004ZNARH4|2.0|I was greatly anticipating this release... And was dealt a blow when I opened it. First off is the cheap coasters. Some Pink Floyd art stamped on some card board. Next were the marbles, the collectors cards and scarf. No big deal. Continued to dig through until I came across the four discs at the bottom. All were loose and all were scratched to hell. I have played through two of the discs and so far I am lucky. My hope is the the last two I go through won't be damaged beyond listening. I can't believe the discs were \\"affixed\\" to the bottom of the box like that. The poor quality of the so called \\"Collectors Material\\" and the brainless way the Discs are packaged almost makes me want return the whole thing. Definitely not worth the money. I will wait for the reviews on the other immersion sets before ordering. I hope they make a great deal of improvements on the 'WYWH' release. What happened to the good old solid CD cases. Cheapest of the cheap if you ask me. No Disc should be shipped in a sleeve of cardboard or attached to the back of a box with hardly anything to keep it in place. ***BUYER BEWARE***
142311339X|5.0|A confused young man is desperate to get his memory back, and a pretty young woman wants to find her missing dad.  I love The Lost Hero because it is exciting, it is action packed, and a little romantic even if you don't learn any values in life. Jason, Piper, and Leo fight Medusa and giant Cyclops.  The fight scenes are action packed because fighting monsters are really cool to read about! Piper, Jason, and Leo ride on a dragon. This is Exciting because the dragon helps them on their journey and it is exhilarating. Jason and Piper are dating.  That is romantic isn't it? Because even though he can't remember Piper he still has feelings for her, and them dating was just a dream for her but they still have feelings for each other.  The Cyclops took Piper's dad and they have to save him.  That is exciting because if they don't Cyclops will kill him they are trying to get to the Cyclops on a mechanical dragon will they make it? Read to find out.  Exciting isn't it, because this the best book ever.   Mikey age 11
B005G4TJI4|1.0|And these masters are Michael Bay and his computers!!!  And we have no one but ourselves to blame!!!  This movie is like a 2.5 hours car crash. When you think it can't get any worse - it does.  It would deserve 2 stars if it didn't have any human actors. But Michael Bay is actually controlled by his computers, and they made him put these humans in this movie to make us suffer even more!!!  This is all I have to say. Transformers IV is coming soon to the theaters near you. Preorder your tickets now!!!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath is so profound, so moving and so forever a source of debate and controversy that one may forget that it is first a great story. It gives voice to a people suffering badly and it portrays them as they surely would like to be seen - as honorable decent people trying to make their way against the forces of nature, man and economics. John Steinbeck masterfully interweaves the struggling of one family into the great calamity of the dust bowl that brought out the worst in some people and best in others as millions deal with poverty and dislocation.<br /><br />You could argue that he idealized the virtuous indigent and vilified the wealthy as cruel and callous but much of what he wrote came of direct observation and much of what occurred in fiction happened in fact. When the pie from which we all feed from shrinks the fight for what remains is dirty and there's a tendency for the empowered to leave the rest behind regardless of legitimacy.<br /><br />The Joad family have lost their farm in Oklahoma and they are joining the great migration to California and the promise of jobs and opportunity. They are a healthy close-knit family that care and look out for each other. The strain of homelessness and uncertainty pays a heavy price which is at the root of the book's story. It would be a hard man not to feel empathy for them and the millions like them. Steinbeck wrote the book in 1938-39. He is staring right into the abyss of the Depression. You can feel the immediacy still. His writing is beautiful as his characters take life and the scenes are clear.<br /><br />When you read one of the most famous books in American literature do you try to ignore the hype and just read the book? There is so much going on here.  Is he arguing for bigger government? Is he anti-capitalist or perhaps supporting communism? My conclusion is he saying \\"look - people are suffering. We Americans have a collective responsibility to each other.\\"  I did not see this as philosophy or a soapbox polemic against anything other than the breakdown in respect for human potential. It is a book that is supposed to raise your empathy and recognize the wasted potential of so many.<br /><br />That the book is still popular and evoking passions 70 years later is a good thing.  I wonder if our legislators in Arizona or Alabama recognize their own actions as creating another generation of homeless, dispossessed immigrants who are fleeing their homes, jobs and schools. What are the costs for these broken families that will no doubt slip into poverty similar to the Joads? I hope there's a Grapes of Wrath being written now to give voice to themthing other than the breakdown in respect for human potential. It is a book that is supposed to raise your empathy and recognize the wasted potential of so many.   That the book is still popular and evoking passions 70 years later is a good thing.  I wonder if our legislators in Arizona or Alabama recognize their own actions as creating another generation of homeless, dispossessed immigrants who are fleeing their homes, jobs and schools. What are the costs for these broken families that will no doubt slip into poverty similar to the Joads? I hope there's a Grapes of Wrath being written now to give voice to them
B003Y5H5KG|4.0|Although the trailer led me to believe this was a horror film, it was more of a psycho-thriller/mystery.  It was well done and thoroughly enjoyable.  Daniel Craig did a very nice performance as the lead character in this movie--a good, solid job.  Of course, this is NOT a movie for your children to see.  The premise is about the murder of a wife and 2 young children, with the husband surviving.  But, let's back up a wee bit.<br /><br />The movie opens with Will Atenten (ah-ten-ten  Daniel Craig) in his editor office, signing off on his severance package.  He has decided to spend more time at home with his family and write a book.  It is snowing outside.  He takes the metro train home and breaks the news to wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and plays with his little girls Trish and Dee Dee.  I got the impression that the family had moved into the house recently.  Trish found flowers on the porch this morning that were not from Will (which probably should have been better tied in or deleted from the film.<br /><br />Soon after Will's retirement, an estranged husband and wife, Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts  neighbors) begin to look at him funny, as does their daughter.  Something seems so familiar about Ann.  Ann's husband looks at Will like he hates him, while the custody battle over the teen-age Patterson girl goes on.<br /><br />When Dee Dee thinks she spots a man outside the window, and Will sees footprints in the snow the next morning, the plot begins to kick into a faster pace.  Will gets up in the middle of the night to see teenagers in his basement, involved in some ritual to commemorate the 5-year anniversary of the murders in this house!  Through talking to the teens and the police, and research, Will finds out that a woman and 2 young girls were shot and killed in his home 5 years ago!  The husband, Peter Ward, was also shot, but lived.  Peter Ward has recently been released from a psychiatric facility because of lack of evidence to charge him criminally.  Our story-line takes Will on a quest to find Peter Ward and some answers and reminds us that our perception is our reality.<br /><br />The story-line was very good and well worth seeing, but it probably could have been developed better, into something outstanding.  Still, this was a very good movie and I plan to purchase the DVD when it becomes available--filmed in Ontario, Canada.o find Peter Ward and some answers and reminds us that our perception is our reality.

B0031SCV46|5.0|First let me state that I'm an amateur music producer who has mixed and produced only a few remixes but is striving to become a much better producer.  With that said I was looking for a midi controller/keyboard to add to my arsenal.  This midi keyboard is everything I wanted it to be.  All the knobs and sliders and wheels have great tactile feeling and the keyboard is semi weighted so you have more feeling in your playing as well.  I've only had time to play with it a little so far but I already love it.  Can't wait to write some of my own songs with it soon.

B0053TMP24|4.0|The Heroes of Olympus series is best selling author Rick Riordan's spinoff of the Percy Jackson novels. This is the second in the series, following the introduction of the Roman hero, Jason Grace. As expected, Percy joins up with Roman forces and we are introduced to two new main characters: Frank Zhang and Hazel Levesque. As usual in a Riordan tale, the perspective changes from chapter to chapter among the main protagonists.<br /><br />Riordan is maturing nicely as a writer, and each new book shows an emerging style that is both engaging and descriptive. Fans of previous Riordan books will find familiar elements, such as nods to popular culture. For instance, in Seattle the heroes find that Amazon.com is run by Amazon warriors, who are often found reading their Kindles.<br /><br />Educational elements are skillfully intertwined in Riordan books, and this one is no exception. Young readers are introduced to Greek and Roman mythology and pick up quite a bit of classical detail despite the fact the story is modernized to a considerable extent. Even though the story is dealing with pagan gods of antiquity, quite a few Christian elements shine through, such as love, friendship, and shared sacrifice.<br /><br />Character development remains strong, and retains typical Riordan memes such as teen angst and finding ones purpose in life (albeit from a demigod's perspective). Fans will enjoy most all aspects of learning about and caring for Zhang and Levesque as well as other minor characters.<br /><br />My biggest beef with the Kindle version of the novel I downloaded was the plethora of typos. Odd paragraph breaks were very common, and words were often smashed together to the point of distraction. For instance, here's part of a sentence that typifies mistakes in the text: \\"... no wall she had to worry about ...\\" It should read,  \\"... now all she had to worry about ...\\" Mistakes like that went on chapter after chapter.<br /><br />Today, Amazon sent an e-mail indicating the publisher is aware of these many mistakes in the electronic text and offered a corrected version. As I have already finished the book, and waded through the errors, it's no big deal. One of the benefits of electronic books is the ability to quickly fix mistakes, but a simple read through by somebody in charge could have prevented these many errors from appearing in early electronic versions in the first place. That said, I'll take off a star from an otherwise five star bookhe electronic text and offered a corrected version.

B005HPA2XI|5.0|Mastodons newest release, \\"The Hunter\\" is not only a throwback to their earlier works, such as \\"Remission\\" and \\"Leviathan,\\" but also exploring new musical territory. The band certainly explored new things and experimented on their previous album \\"Crack the Skye,\\" but The Hunter isn't quite as prog rockish as Crack the Skye, and bring heavy and faster paced songs.     The albums opener, \\"Black tongue\\" is a heavy fantastically paced juggernaut that lets you immediately know that this is a different Mastodon that you heard in 2009's Crack the Skye. \\"I burned out my eyes, I cut off my tongue!\\" These lyrics are reminiscent of the style of \\"Remission,\\" and some agree to be a welcome change than deeply introspective lyrics, (not that later tracks on the album are void introspection mind you.         The first single, (besides the bonus track \\"Deathbound\\") Is Curl of the burl, a fun, accessible song that new listeners can be broken into the wonder that is Mastodon, and also can be appreciated by veteran fans.    \\"Blasteroid\\" throws the listener into heavy, fast paced, riff smacking beauty, definitely one of the albums gems.    Other excellent tracks include \\"Stargasm\\", \\"Creature lives\\" (simple but affective) and \\"Spectrelight.\\"    The only track I feel slows down the album is \\"The Hunter,\\" which plods along in deep introspection, and heavily personal lyrics.    This album is the first album since remission not to be a concept album, which I feel freed up the band to try new things without restriction of the feel of one general \\"style,\\" leaving the band the ability to truly show what they are capable of.      Mastodon is unlike any other band out there, unique and unapologetic about what they want to do. The best metal, prog-metal, Alterna-sludge, Thrash-punk, Genre bending artists out there. It is a wonder what Mastodon will do next, and even though the album just came out, I already long for more...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great movies.  I had no issues with these movies, I thought they were great for a second watch on blu-ray.

B00127RAJY|5.0|My first day of doing this dvd I weighed 227 lbs. For a 25 year old, 5'8\\" female, that is pretty horrible. Fast forward 12 weeks and I now weigh 190.  I love this dvd! The workout is tough and you will feel it, but it's a good burn that lets you know that you're accomplishing something. I don't rely solely on this dvd, I've also taken up running and I have myself on a strict 1200 calorie a day diet, but this dvd is definitely what gave me the motivation to change my lifestyle. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to make a positive and healthy change in their life.  Also, even better than the weight loss is the change in clothing size! My favorite store to shop at is The Limited; I've gone from an XL top and size 16 pant to a M top and size 10 pant. Just did some shopping as a little reward for myself! :)

B005JABSB6|4.0|Title is enough said. I got the AN-3dg10-s for free with the TV projects. Could not stop myself from getting the AN-3dg20-b once I was told the price of $85 less then what Sharp was recommending the price. 30 hours of usage between charges with an 90 minute charge time equals zero need for batteries. Light weight and simple looking compared to An-3dg10-s. Only need to switch postion on knob compared to holding button to turn on or off. So far so good.
B005JABSB6|3.0|I ordered these when I bought my 60\\" Sharp 3D TV from Amazon. Glance at the picture on the product description page (maybe they will change this soon) and it shows two glasses. I thought that I would get a set of (two pair) of glasses. Take note! It is not two sets of glasses. The picture only shows the glasses from two angles. The description is so vague that this is not clear at all.

B000H7J9QM|5.0|I've seen this movie many times, and each time I've really enjoyed watching it. I like the camera work, the plot, the characters, and also the soundtrack. The only thing I really don't like about the movie is that in the story, the police begin shooting at the young carjackers without any provocation. I doubt the cops of a plush suburban area would just start blazing away at a small group of carjackers that have not attacked first.
B005D51JQQ|5.0|It appears that this is a great set to have all or most of Sting's hits with a few album tracks here and there all played out chronologically.  However, it would have been cool to include some rare stuff in there like B-sides and/or non-album tracks that appeared on movie soundtracks.  Also, why not a DVD or Blu-Ray disc of Sting's music videos to accompany the set.  Now that is something that could have made the price worth it.  $111 and change is way too much for a 4 disc set, don't you think.
B003498SDA|5.0|Although I'd expected it to be fairly slow paced for an action movie, it turned out to seem even slower, but only because there are many segments without a music score and are just quiet. I didn't mind, since it really built the proper mood for the characters and story. But I would advise not seeing this movie when you are drowsy, you'll likely dose off at some point.<br /><br />It did an excellent job of building the characters in the beginning, and showing a realistic development of them during the story. It kept me guessing about the end of the story, since I was never sure if it would be one of those movies where the main character dies or even \\"saves the day\\" at the end, or not.<br /><br />This is a movie I'll want to see again for the mood and to appreciate the characters.
B00466HN6S|4.0|This is a really cute movie. I hope they release it in the US.  It has been released in the United Kingdom.
0374530718|5.0|On the surface Sophie's World is a bit of a mystery story, with a young girl receiving messages from a strange man she has never met before. These messages talk about great philosophers of history, and the philosophical movements they started. She tries to figure out who this man is, and how he knows so much about her. But the whole novel is really an introduction to philosophy, starting with the ancient tribal beliefs of pre-history, all the way up to post-modern thoughts of today. A very cool, educational book, although the storyline of the young girl gets too weird for my taste in the final third of the book. At that point I just kept reading for the philosophy lesson alone. Also, many of the modern philisophies are breezed over, with some puzzling emphasis on less influential ones. I would definitely recommend this to read or as a gift for anyone interested in a very easy to understand introduction to philosophy throughout human history.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I think I'm about to use up my quota of exclamation points. Boxing robots! Wait, let me write that in caps... BOXING ROBOTS!! I am currently eating crow about REAL STEEL. I saw the trailer for it weeks ago and pronounced it a stupid rock 'em sock 'em robot punching flick. Turns out, it IS a rock 'em sock 'em robot punching flick, but it is awesome. Enough human elements are introduced to ground the wackadoo premise. Atom, the underdog boxing robot, works on your bump of sympathy, sneaks past your defenses, clocks you with its unexpected soulfulness. Yes, I am anthropomorphising an inanimate object, but that is one damn evocative boxing robot.<br /><br />In the near future, the Sweet Science has replaced its human pugilists with metal robots, robots being more durable and destructive and therefore more likely to sate our cravings for carnage and claret. But it's odd watching Hugh Jackman play a shifty, irresponsible ex-boxer and nogoodnik - name of Charlie Kenton - who ekes out a living by traveling from place to place and pitting his ramshackle boxing robot in seedy matches. Charlie Kenton's line of debt continues to mount because an impulsive character like Charlie can't be bothered to think things thru and he usually ends up with his nads in a sling. Fleeing another incurred debt, Charlie learns of an old girlfriend's passing and, even more relevant, that this leaves him possibly stuck with their eleven-year-old kid Max. It's a measure of Hugh Jackman's appeal that you still find him likable even though his role calls for his being a shirker, a welcher, and an absentee father. The film, naturally, gives him opportunities for redemption, and Jackman makes it work. But, don't get it twisted, no one sells the heel-to-hero journey quite as grandly as Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Because of this and that, Charlie Kenton ends up taking his estranged, suspicious son on the road, and Max turns out to be an avid robot boxing fan. Crummy luck or sheer inept boxing strategizing has caused Charlie's robots to succumb to getting their metal mugs caved in. One night, during an illegal run thru a metal scrap yard (in search of enough parts to construct another fight 'bot), Charlie and Max stumble upon a buried robot, an old and smaller model named Atom. Max promptly adopts it like it's a pet. It's apropos; thematically, REAL STEEL exudes a huge whiff of \\"a boy and his dog.\\"<br /><br />Atom is a relic, an old Generation II model, a lowly sparring 'bot. It's able to absorb massive doses of punishment but isn't much in the way of an offensive arsenal. What it does have is a rare \\"shadow\\" function which allows it to mimic Charlie's boxing moves... and Max's dancing. Yes, boxing DANCING robots!! Take that, Bumblebee!<br /><br />This kid, Dakota Goyo, who plays Max, bursts out of nowhere and makes an impact with his good acting and savvy and moxie. Max is a spirited kid who won't back down, and I found myself admiring him as the grown-up in this father-and-son pair. And I dare you not to think it adorable when you watch Max and his robot bust out their dance routine during their ring walk. If you've seen your share of sports movies then the story thread hits familiar beats. But it's easy to yield to the underdog theme. Atom is clearly smaller and not as sleek and less powerful than the monster robots he faces in the ring. The fights are rousing. Metal smashing metal, servos and gears and widgets and other metallic whatnot sent hurtling willy-nilly. Maybe it helped that Sugar Ray Leonard was consulted for the fight choreography. Atom certainly exhibited some slick moves. I know the theater audience was frequently vocal and involved and cheering. We track Atom's rise in the pugilistic ranks as he gains street creds and word of mouth pub. It's not long before he cracks the World Robot Boxing scene and set to take on the mighty Zeus, the greatest robot boxer of all time.<br /><br />Throw in an Evangeline Lilly who makes the most of her limited role as theromantic interest, and what we have is a movie that doesn't lack for warmth and heart and surprising emotional content. REAL STEEL caters towards them kids, but there's also enough here for grown-ups to savor. The robots, whether animated thru CG or animatronics, are flawlessly rendered. I hear there's already a sequel in the works. Good. Maybe then they'll address the topic of Atom's sentience which was sort of hinted at but then promptly dropped. Bro, go check this out.romantic interest, and what we have is a movie that doesn't lack for warmth and heart and surprising emotional content.

0525951652|4.0|I am a Follett fan, especially his WWII novels, and am also a huge fan of Downton Abbey and other PBS early 20th century shows.  So this book was right up my alley.  But it was not exactly a rip-roaring classic. I read it all and it took me 6 weeks, but I never felt like I couldn't put it down.  What I liked:   --The peak inside Edwardian English Lord's house \\"upstairs downstairs style\\"  --Welsh miner lives  --Plenty of decently steamy sex scenes!  --Daily life of Russians  --Soap opera episodes and some generally believable characters  What I thought was a bit lacking:  --A bit too much \\"inside baseball\\"l of Russian Revolution and WWI politics and Labor movement (But it made it clearer in my mind than most textbooks)   --Coincidences of different families coming together across oceans/continents were sometimes a bit farfetched  --Not enough USA family  Overall I will give the second book a try but I'm not just breathless over this one.

B002VRZEYM|1.0|this movie has a radical left wing agenda. it portrays modern day unions as saving the modern day worker and customers of food products. the film also lobbies for illegal immigrants and paints the typical \\"evil corporations\\" as the source of all of humanities problems.  it does have unbiased truth here and there, but if your smart, you will see that most of the movie is opinion based from a few facts. i gave it one star, as i don't like read or watch anything i can see a political bias in.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|First, let me say that I like the movie.  But if you don't like it, then ignore it.  If you don't know, check movie reviews or rent it first and decide for yourself.  That aside, this review isn't about the Movie - but rather the media.  So, I'll admit that I'm a little late to the HDTV party.  I've actively shunned Blu-Ray - price has been too high and also I have substantial DVD content.  When Amazon offered this title with the Triple format (Blu-Ray, DVD, AND Digital Copy) - and - the price was $19.99 (pre-order) I thought it had to be a mistake.  That's close to my personal 'price point' - and the DVD includes a Blu-Ray and Digital copy.  I've moved to streaming, use  both the Amazon Cloud as well as Amazon Digital Content and have setup my own DLNA Media Server.  This would be a perfect addition to my digital video library - and High Def.  Boy was I wrong.  After Amazon shipped, I started checking my Amazon Digital Library for my new purchase to show up.  Finally, the package from Amazon arrived ON FRIDAY !!! - New releases are on Tuesday, and previously w/Prime, Amazon has shipped on Monday.  Usually, I have the package on Tuesday or Wednesday.  I'm  Amazon Prime, pre-ordered weeks in advance, it's not like it was a surprise or something.  But, ok, I can live with that.  I drive by Wal-mart, Target, K-mart, Blockbuster, Costco & 5 Redboxes every day - If I really needed it on Tuesday or Wednesday I can shop there instead of Amazon.  When I finally GET my 'triple' play - I read on a little insert - that the Digital Copy is a Download from Paramount.  Oh, not quite what I was expecting, but again I can live with that.  So, off I go to the URL to download the Movie.  There is an ITunes option - but I don't do business with ITunes - I have Amazon.  First, you must download and install the Paramount Download Manager (great more crap-ware on the PC).  Only then you can download the Movie.  Transformers-DOTM runs 2:34:40 to watch.  The download file is 2.1GB (the maximum Amazon Cloud Video file size allowed is 2.0GB) - and the download took 4 1/2 DAYS.  The download manager would stop, apparently at random sometime after about 8 hours every day.  The download rate - when it was working varied between 20-50kb/s (old dialup modem speed).  Now, after 4 1/2 days, the resolution on the download is either 720x300 or 320x136 (a second 800mb version) - so It's not 1080 HD anyway - and is no better than the DVD.  They are Windows WMV files that carry DCP - so they don't work with the Logitech Revue - Google TV or the Google Chromebook and I and can't recode them to something else that is compatible - or even split it in 1/2 so I can upload it to the Amazon Cloud.  What a lousy mess - and terrible experience.  To be fair - I did find (too late) - a Amazon FAQ that gave some warning - and did clarify the Digital Copy didn't go to the Amazon Digital Media Library.  Believe me neither Paramount or Amazon will get me to waste any money - ever again on a Blu-Ray - Triple Play or anything else with the deplorable utility of the Digital Copy.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Let me just begin with the fact that I stayed up for 2 hours finishing this at 4 am this morning after a random crying baby wake-up call. If that's not an indication in and of itself for the engagement factor, you probably don't need to read the rest of this review.  Ready Player One is very well-written. The vocabulary is well-explained for the nongeek. The characters are fully developed and lovable or hate-able as needed. And of course, it's completely 80s focused despite being set in the near future. All in all, this story has everything for everyone who has ever been interested in World of Warcraft, virtual reality, the 80s, or the impending economic and energetic (energic?) collapse of our society. I even forgive Ernest for waiting until the last few chapters to mention the ColecoVision, my own favorite memory from the 80s. At least it was in there.  This book goes firmly in my to-be-emulated stack for everything from plot and character development to pacing and attitude. In short, I loved it. And it's just a fangirl's dream that he's just down the street from me, in terms Texas distances. I can't wait for the next local signing in two weeks!
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|What can you say. This is some of their best. A part of that prolific period, tumultuous for sure but with a mind journey well worth taking.
B000YAA68C|4.0|This is a sweet and heartbreaking movie. Holly's husband dies of a brain tumor and she receives posthumous letters of instructions and assurance of how to live life without him. Hilary Swank is good in this, her performance brought tears to my eyes throughout the film. She goes through the stages of grief and is perturbed that life is moving on without him. One thing I didn't like is that Harry Connick Jr. is set up to be as a love interest; I don't care for him and didn't like the message that one must find love again so soon. The ending was perfect and brought a sense of hope.

As soon I finished watching this movie I added more of Hayao Miyazaki's films to my queue. I watched it again with the English audio and must say that I prefer the Japanese audio with English subtitles.
B003L77G38|5.0|This show gets better and better. It is a combination of the old X-Files, one step beyond and a great sense of humor to boot. The characters have been well developed and the story line gets deeper with each season. An excellent show in all respects.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This is a charming movie about resiliency and overcoming the pressure to conform to standard gender norms in order to achieve your dreams. Nobody is a bad guy here and everybody is treated as complex human beings. I was really touched of the sensitive handling of friend who already knows who he is and is not afraid show this side of himself with Billy.
B000T05R90|4.0|Not for those who remember Floyd from Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall.This is early stuff with hints of greatness to come. To understand what they achieved and where they took us, this is a very good listen into their roots.
B0011N1WE8|3.0|This is a sweet fairy-tale story. I did enjoy it but felt that this movie is too busy. I could go without witnessing Penelope's love interest's (James McAvoy) dark side of gambling and struggling to put his life together again. We don't really see how he comes to love her or why as they only spent a few times together in separate rooms with a two-way mirror between them. Maybe he was charmed by her cute voice and plucky spirit? The art direction is fabulous and Peter Dinklage and Reese Witherspoon are standouts here. It's hard to articulate what I don't like about this film; it simply felt too rushed with several subplots that it was overwhelming.
B005JU5JTI|5.0|I hate what I call 13 year old boy movies. This far exceeds in the laugh factor. I went to see it twice in the theaters, pre-ordered it in both stream and DVD, I just cannot get enough of it!!! It is so funny! Yes, I was disappointed when the sound had an issue but really that was not something that could be helped. Amazon got the issue worked out and I am watching the movie over and over again! Cheers!
B004LWZW4W|2.0|You can tell from the start, they made this movie so they would a property that would generate a lot of sequels.<br />People do and say dumb things just so the inevitable ending will come and the Apes will....Take over the world.<br /><br />Franco plays dumb scientist guy who does things that don't make sense just for the sake of the movie and getting from point A to point B.<br />He does this all so he can try to cure his Fathers Alzheimer's. He jeopardized the whole damn world just so he could help one person. So basically he is the hero of the movie. The one that helps destroy the world as we know it.<br /><br />He is not the only unsympathetic character in the movie. There are lots of scientists that work with Franco and of course are there just to serve the plot and....get killed off. It's like a Friday the 13th movie; one character after another.<br /><br />And we can't forget a love interest thrown into mix. She of course helps start the end of civilization because she goes along with Dumb Scientist guy. She is the equivalent of Megan's Fox character in the first two Transformers movie.<br /><br />In my opinion, this was one of the more overrated movies of the year. This year's Avatar. The movie everyone goes and spends Millions on and I try to figure out what all the fuss is all about.  I would take a movie like Drive or Watchmen any day.
0143117564|5.0|Throughout this review, I'm going to reference a phrase \\"The Man\\", but without the quotes.  The Man can be interpreted as those in power - CEOs, police higher-ups, real estate tycoons, etc.  Note that the exact phrase The Man does not appear anywhere in this book, as far as I can remember.  But that phrase seems to be the easiest for me to make my points.  In this novel, which I think is Pynchon's easiest to follow (I've read Vineland, Gravity's Rainbow, The Crying of Lot 49, a little bit of V, and am starting Mason & Dixon), the overall theme I'm seeing is that The Man wants to keep things under control, and the Manson murders have spooked them (this takes place around 1970 in Southern California).  There's also the remembrance of the Watts Riots as additional support for The Man's worry.  The novel's main character, Doc Sportello, represents a free-spirit wannabe that is certainly unhappy with The Man.  Most every possible case of lower-class revolution (even if just in thought only) is addressed and stifled by The Man.  I think that Pynchon's views, and even more of himself, are represented by Doc and sometimes argued out loud, with passion.  It seems to me that past Pynchon protagonists have not felt as passionately about their viewpoint.  But Doc does realize that those that support his viewpoint are either without power to make changes, or they simply don't have the energy to try.  So, he's realistic, but nonetheless passionate.  Somehow, I think of the novel's voice as being illustrated by the movie Billy Jack (also not referenced in the book).  It's that scene where Billy is surrounded by a bunch of thugs and he's told \\"You don't think those Green Beret karate tricks are going to save you from all these boys, do you?\\"  To which he replies \\"I don't have much of a choice, do I?  But, you know what, I'm going to take this right foot here and wop you on that side of the face.\\"  Billy knows he's beat, but he's going to get some hard shots in.  In the end, I feltsatisfied that the loose ends were, in fact, tied up - at least to my satisfaction.  The final pages give a perfect sense for how I felt by the end of the novel.  I really liked this book, and maybe loved it.  I liked the Doc character and pretty much agreed with his politics.  Additionally, I felt for Doc.  As with any Pynchon novel, there are a lot of peripheral characters, and back stories.  Doc is the only fully fleshed-out character, but the novel is also from his viewpoint.  Thus, he explains only what he knows and so you get his understanding of the other characters.  I suppose a certain detective gets explained in some detail, but once again only from Doc's viewpoint.  Overall, I'd put this book on par with Vineland and The Crying of Lot 49.  However, to me it ends with more certainty than either of those books.  In fact, you can say that the three of those books form a segment of time from the 1960's to the 1980's - so they make perfect companions to each other.    After just finishing some book about a vampire private investigator, this one was so much more satisfying.
0307352145|5.0|What would you say to an attorney who loved her work on Wall Street but hated face to face meetings and found her self as the lead attorney on a negotiation team charged with solving a serious problem for a client as she sat across the table from a team of intimidating lawyers from the other side?    What would you say to a frustrated and concerned parent who wanted her child to fit in and have friends but who instead preferred to read at home?  How about a university student who found the \\"discussions\\" of their classes disgusting and a waste of time?  With the premise in her introduction (that parallels Stephen Covey's similar views in his introduction to his 7 Habits of Highly Effective People) that a shift from a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality has \\"unleashed in ordinary people-introverts and extraverts-a nagging sense of personal inferiority that plagues them to this day\\" Susan Cain, a self-professed introvert, begins leading us on a journey of visits to quiet people such as university and high school students, parents of \\"quiet\\" but gifted and articulate children, a well-known mega church (Saddleback Community in Southern California), and through a number of signifcant studies of introversion and extroversion as she seeks to encourage all of us to \\"be true to yourself.\\"  Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, (to be published in January 2012 by Crown Publishing) is a thoroughly researched book in which Cain argues for a greater understanding and acceptance of those who are often thought shy, bookish, backward, and even anti-social - introverts. Basing her views of introversion on the views and study of Carl Jung, Cain suggests that there is a place, a much needed place at times, for introverts in our society as a companion, and in some cases, a check, against the predominate extroversion of our time.  Along the way, Cain, takes us into  ... the workplace and challenges the current preoccupation with groupthink and argues that working alone is still a viable and necessary activity for both productivity and business success.  ... the modern American classroom and the need to help both school systems as well as the classroom affirm and encourage the introverted student to thrive as much as the extroverted student  ... the financial world and how \\"introverts and extroverts think (and process dopamine) differently\\" as she contrasts the 'Wizard of Omaha\\" Warren Buffett who has made money in a tough economy with those whose risk taking caused financial loss for themselves and others as well  ... parents, and students, who struggle with a 'shy' label that creates both personal and academic problems instead of seeing how the richness of their inner world is an asset  In this midst of this journey she focuses her study on what I have often thought about on this discussion on personality as a whole and this particular aspect of personality.  How much of it is nurture and how much of it is nature? Where does free will come into play?  Her significant use of studies done on identified introvert and extroverted students using MRI scans is a strength of this book as it reveals that there is a biological and chemical aspect to personality that must be considered. But in doing so she acknowledges that there is a grey area into which we must take account in the dynamic of human personality.  In short, Quiet affirms the place and importance of introversion in society and Cain challenges our current extroverted society with bringing the deep and necessary gifts of those who are more introverted into play.  (I wish Cain would have taken more time to discuss ambiversion as I believe that I am such a person and that there are others who are equally able to move between introversion and extroversion without difficult. But I also enjoyed her presentation of High and Low Self Monitoring (HSM's and LSM's) discussed in chapter 9, When should you act more extroverted that you really are?)  In short, I believe that Quiet is going to be, and must be, a welcome volume to the discussion of personality in the years ahead because of its impact on our personal lives, our education, our workplace, our financial health, and (an area Cain briefly discussed) our faith. I am glad that Cain, whose own story is told in a unique way in the book, has written this book.  I believe that this book would be a great book for college classes on personality, for those in ministerial training, as well as for human resource and educator continuing ed and training.  On my review scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (great) book I rate Quiet a 5 a great read!  Note: An advance reader copy of this book was sent to me via the Amazon Vine review program in exchange for a review. I was not required to write a positive review.

0451232577|4.0|It's a big book just like pillars. But just like pillars you just want to keep going.....  I should have looked to see if all three books had been written; once I'm on a series I generally just keep going.  This is big but if you want huge try reading all the dark tower novels in a row. Steven King even needed a 10 year break for that series.   4 out of 5 stars just because I'm not a huge history fan, but the detail makes up for that. All of the novels by Ken Follett have given me new understanding of history. Not an easy task for someone who generally thought history was boring. Great characters on a vast canvas in time and space.  Mr. Follett GET BUSY I'M waiting!

B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey X has spoiled me when it comes to typing.  I love being able to press only a few letters and having the word I want pop up as a choice.  There are many times that I don't have to press any letters, SwiftKey just knows what the next logical word would be in my sentence based on what it has learned from me.  I can never go back to the stock keyboard or even Swype again. Well worth the cost.

B00003CXIY|5.0|Road Trip is the story of Josh Parker(Brecken Meyer)and his childhood crush and girlfriend Tiffany Henderson(Rachel Blanchard)As Tiffany leaves for college in Texas, her and Josh promise to keep in touch and commit to a long distance relationship. During his friends party he meets the stunning blonde Beth (Amy Smart), and experience's a night he will never forget. He videotaped his one special night with Beth and accidentally mails the tape down the University of Texas where Tiffany can find it. Now with his mid-term on the Horizon Josh and his friends must quickly travel to Texas and retrieve the tape. With Cars exploding, a black fraternity, stealing school buses from the deaf, and other hilarious road blocks, and Josh's student teacher Jacob (Anthony Rapp) who's trying to get  him kicked out of school because he's jelaous of Beth and Josh's new relationship. Road Trip is one of the funniest College comedies of the 2000's decade. I definitely recommend it.
B000P0J09W|4.0|First of all I love this movie.   That being said, I wanted to share this movie with my girlfriend and her family, who are Mexicans. The spanish version speaks spanish way too fast and the kids voices are way too high pitched. Worst voices for the parts of the characters. Her family couldn't even understand some of the spanish being said.
0385736002|4.0|Stories that educate and entertain are a big plus in my book, but really - who doesn't like these type of stories.<br /><br />I know I am enjoying a book when I pick it up and my first thought on who to recommend the book to is my nephew.  I'm fairly picky when it comes to passing titles his way because I want him to read books worth reading - and The Alchemyst is definitely that.  But I'm also torn - because I want to own this series for myself as well... ahhhh, the pain of being a bibliophile!<br /><br />I enjoyed Sophie and Josh, I thought they were very accurate portrayals of kids nowadays.  I found their struggle and connection to be believable, even if their circumstances were not.  The added bonus of the characters surrounding them, i.e. Nicholas Flamel and Dr. John Dee, being actual historical figures clinched the deal when it came down to liking the book.<br /><br />The Alchemyst is filled with adventures, magic, a nicely rounded magic system (another plus), history, mystery and drama.  It's designed to grip onto the imagination of its reader and not let go until you've read the last page, and in this world today of electronic gadgets, television shows, video games and more - that's a good thing for a book to do.<br /><br />I plan to finish the series and have a feeling I'll enjoy my ride through Scott's world.  I also admit to cackling a bit at the emergence of some very familiar names through the Elders.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I cannot believe that in this day and age of digital techno;ogy that a company such as Amazon can be so short sighted as to NOT offer this product to international customers.  It incomprehensible that you can purchase books via the kindle 3G network from anywhere you can get a signal almost world wide, using any international bank issued credit card, and yet you cannot buy anything for the android outside of the US unless you have a US bank issued credit card with a US billing address! This should be in big BOLD letters at the very top of the app page so people don't waste their time trying to download and then install the app only to find that it is effectively region locked.    Come on Amazon, the US is not the ONLY market in the world!  A very pissed off Kindle owner.
B003Y5H5K6|3.0|I'm always in the mood for a good ghost story, so I assumed I would<br />find one in DREAM HOUSE--not to mention the fact that the cast was<br />headed by Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts.<br /><br />On the plus side, the snowy New England effects work to provide the<br />right atmosphere, as does an eerie background score that ramps up the<br />shock factor at every possibility. Unfortunately, there are very few<br />genuine shocks and the suspense stays at a very even level throughout.<br /><br />The performances are valid enough too. Daniel Craig does a fine job of<br />acting while keeping his shirt on for most of the film and Rachel Weisz<br />has some nice chemistry with him as his devoted wife. The children are<br />played with simplicity and charm by two adorable youngsters.<br /><br />But that's not enough. There has to be some logic behind the haunted<br />house story and the discovery that a family had been slaughtered there<br />years before. And when the final twist comes, the viewer will be<br />fighting off boredom to such a degree that the surprise factor in the<br />final scene will be a mere blip on the film's radar. And then,<br />abruptly, the film ends.<br /><br />Surely, something went wrong in processing the script and bringing it<br />to a final resolution that bears close scrutiny. But with all the talk<br />of Jim Sheridan wanting his name off the directorial credits, I should<br />have been forewarned that this would not be a good, coherent ghost<br />story. Somewhere, a good story is struggling to get out.<br /><br />To make matters worse, I viewed the film in a theater where two girls<br />in the row behind me never stopped chattering and laughing<br />inappropriately at all the tense moments. If the story had been really<br />gripping, I would have told them more than to stop kicking the seat.<br />Alas, they were immature and totally unaware that they were movie pests<br />of the first degree and spoiled whatever enjoyment I could get from the<br />film
0316056863|4.0|From beginning to end the book was hilarious. I personally really like Tina Fey, so I read hungrily. It was a fun read and I still think she's pretty funny and quite clever in the way she writes. I was surprised at how little I knew about her life although I had seen a lot of her work. If what you want is a laugh and funny things to show your partner or your friends (like I did) you would enjoy the book.
1423140591|5.0|This was much better than I could ever have expected. I just love this Percy Jackson series and the characters.The Heros of Olympus continues where the previous book one ended. The author<br />introduces us to new demigods in Roman Camp. We are also wondering what happened to Percy, where is he? and the author continues to reveal the clues to that mystery at the new camp.<br />There are lots of new demigods in this second book, and especially one is interesting:<br />Hazel. She is the daughter of Pluto. She has the ability to change earth to precious metals and jewels but there is a curse attached to that ability for those who find or accept them.<br />Another new hero is Frank Zhang, Mars' son.  remember that Percy was not in good relations with Mars-god and now the author introduces another child of Mars...)<br /><br />A new quest involves Thanatos, the guardian of the underworld, who has been taken into captivity and his absence has caused serious trouble (read the book to learn what!).<br /><br />This is a great, adventure-filled book for young readers and they will love it just like all the other Percy books!
B004XANKVO|4.0|So far so good. I've had this pack for approx 3 weeks with daily use and I think I'm going to be very happy in the long term. Materials & contsruction are good to excellent. Thule took a less is more approach with the padding - but that's not to say it is uncomfortable, just not as bulky as some others I considered. I love the external open pouch, I use it constantly and it is extremely handy. My usual load is two full size texts, two ringed notebooks, assrtd pens, pencils, calculator, meal bar, etc, plus my iPad, charger and a few other odds and ends and it is comfortable under that weight and not \\"stuffed\\" full. I could get more in it for sure though. Also I am 6' 1\\" and the size is good for me, could be a little large for a slender girl.  The only FYI I can think of is the material pattern, in photos the white in the material doesn't really show up. So if you're seriously considering, enlarge those pics to see if what I am talking about would concern you.

B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I didn't see The Lion King back during it's original theatrical release, but they had already started using computers to put the films together. Now I'm not going to spoil the story for you but I'm going to assume that most of you already know it.  The 3D in this movie is spectacular, for years I thought that a hand-drawn 2D animated could never be presented in 3D without looking cheesy but for this movie, if you want the cheese, just get cheddar flavored popcorn and enjoy because the 3D here in a film like this can only be good if it's a conversion in this case. I normally don't like the fact that a film is converted to 3D rather then being shot in 3D like Avatar was but if you where to set this up on a traditional animation camera setup and put a 3D camera in it's place, you'll never get this result, not even with the multi-plane setup. This just goes to show that when it comes to Disney, the best is always yet to come, the next step is a brand-new hand drawn animated feature getting this 3D treatment on it's introduction. If you thought Avatar was something, you ain't seen nothing yet.  The Lion King 3D gets a 5 out of 5.
0060775858|1.0|This book, though highly regarded, sets the stage for something awful in childhood development.  It teaches children to anthropomorphise (and on top of that show respect to!) all sorts of random aspects of creation.  I didn't climb to the top of the food chain to have my child concern himself with pleasantries to objects.  The room serves us, not the other way around!  It should thank us for building it and giving it a purpose, not expect us to wish it well at night.  It's this type of nonsense that will have my child on the dole after dropping out of high school.

B001O37WTY|1.0|I am still terribly confused.  I wondered if this biography was even authorized, but John Malkovich was in it, so it must have been.  That makes me worry it was autobiographical, he seemed so lucid and sane in other movies.  Also, the building with a floor at half height, what building inspector signed off on that?  Talk about a fire hazard.  The thing could not have been structurally sound.  I am just glad no actors got hurt filming in that strange building.  There are a lot of good reviews though, so maybe I am missing something.

Carefully reading the Amazon listing I realized it was probably not going to be the same as what I had seen at the cinema. Before ordering I made certain my late model OPPO Blu Ray machine was capable of playing the PAL format. The only surprises the DVD presented were the excellent extra features not seen in the theatrical release, much in English. Those who didn't understand what they were ordering may want to wait for the U.S. DVD release, or try a NASCAR video.
B005FLX2WC|4.0|After J.B.'s last three outings - I swore off purchasing any more of his albums. They are over produced/mixed badly (listen to one of his early albums)and seem uninspired to me. There is just not as much passion in his later (anything after Sloe Gin)stuff, Same with this release - BUT - Ms. Hart brings enough passion to the table to make up for what is still a lackluster JB performance. While the album is a little(?) on the muddy sounding side and the guitars are not as prominent as I like, Bett Hart makes up for all of the short comings on this album. This is the best I have heard her - of course I am only familiar with a few albums. hart fans should love this - JB fans will be torn .....

0618001905|5.0|Henry Morton Stanley was a remarkable figure.  He was an explorer a pioneer and a survivor.  King Leopold's Ghost also points out very well that he was just all too human and too mortal.  Stanley, like all good heroes, was a flawed character.  Part of his flaws were what made him malleable in the hands of a Leopold in order to secure Leopold's hand hold over a colony - in this case the \\"Belgian\\" Congo.<br /><br />Stanley, Patrice Lumumba, Sir Roger Casement, even Sir Winston Churchill have roles in this book.  Hochschild strings together fascinating personal stories as he tells the tale of the Congo. I had never heard of Edmund Dene Morel, and, after reading of his exploits here, I wonder why he isn't more widely known.<br /><br />This book will grip you and take you through darkest Africa, palaces in Belgium, London, Kinshasa, Leopoldville, Stanley Falls and a deserted stretch of beach in Ireland.  It is a fascinating story of crimes against humanity, exploitation, justification, glory, greed, misery and betrayal. In the end, you will understand the legacy of colonialism in the Congo.<br /><br />But you will also walk away with a bit of a bitter taste knowing that even today, we are still raping the Congo to exploit its raw materials while the people, the Africans - who are the rightful owners - continue to languish in the background.  Or worse, are subject to vicious and brutal regimes put in place by western benefactor governments more concerned about the value of minerals than the value of human lives.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone interested in the history or future of Africa or in the history or future of imperialism and colonialism anywhere in the world.<br /><br />-Mike

They had love,intrigue,crime,killing,and a futuristic society.The books followed each other well. the characters were believable.My only thought on the final ending is that I would have liked the lead character to have ended up with a different person.But that would have been too predictable.I had trouble putting the books down until they were finished. I definitely will be reading this author's other books.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Yikes. This book was a little unfortunate... I was okay with Katniss's sudden character change, since it just shows how badly not one but TWO hunger games can screw with her mind. Her mental fragility was actually a welcome change. I even liked how District Thirteen was used. But my God what an underwhelming conclusion. There were parts that were just too rushed, and parts that were not rushed enough. I hated how the romance was just a little side note. Yes, we know that Katniss is not exactly the most romantic protagonist the book world has seen but COME ON. It was a little half-a**ed and the ending was just... not... good. Just when I thought there would be a climax... no climax... or somewhat of a climax??? Eh. I gave this book three stars because of Katniss's interesting character development. I took that, but I wish I could have left everything else. Meh.
B004KKX814|5.0|I got this top to battle with my sons and i love it and so do they. I would reckomen this to kids or in my case adults who like to beyblade with there kids.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a good sequel to the wonderful page turner \\"Hunger Games\\", although **Spoiler alert** I was disappointed that they decided to do the hunger games AGAIN. ugh. The second hunger games was not as good as the hunger games of the first book. Just different. And a little annoying at times. I felt at times that maybe it was a poor decision on the author's part to further the series by way of a second hunger games. It also got more fantastical but not in a good way. It kept me reading though. Cheers.
B004KKX80A|5.0|I got this top at the same time I got L-Drago Destroy (an other great top to have) to battle with my sons. It is probly one of the best attack tops around my sons dont like it too much cuz they lose to it but on the other hand when they use it they love it haha.Any way very fun to have for kids or adults that like to battle there kids.

B0053TMP24|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book quite a bit.  It started off a bit slow but then became quicker as the book went on. The last 1/3 of the book is almost non-stop action.  It will be fun to see Percy and Jason in action together in the next book.  Unfortunately we'll have to wait another year until we can have that pleasure.<br /><br />This book is well worth the read as are all of Rick Riordan's past writings.

The only problem with this book is that some a few pictures don't have captions but other than that it is amazing. Really worth the price, Great buy, and if you are a Alice Madness Returns fan you will truly love it!
B003UESJIS|2.0|I bought this film based on the directing of Mike Leigh and the lead actor Jim Broadbent, who had so successfully linked up in Topsy Turvy - a remarkable insight into the lives and music of Gilbert and Sullivan.  While I found Broadbent and the other actors in this movie to be convincing, I found the story itself and the sad sack loser characters it portrays to be painful to endure.  Basically nothing happens in the movie - ends as boringly as it starts.    This is a character study of lost souls propped up by draining the energy and time of the \\"normal\\" main characters they rely upon.  The \\"normal\\" main characters are portrayed so convincingly you want to wince when they have to survive the burdens imposed by their well meaning friends and family.  If you are into slow-moving and intricate character pieces about the burdens of ordinary life, you may enjoy this.  Frankly, it seemed like a well acted but depressing soap opera piece to me.

031236198X|1.0|This book is driven by the author's political agenda.  His thinly veiled references to the Bush administration's famed bungles and his over-the-top global warming theme shine throughout the book.  There is no place for this load of rhetoric in the business word.  To be clear, I am a believer in global warming and I understand where our government fell short on the Katrina and 9/11 crises.  I also know that there are two sides to everything.  Something the author tries to convince us is not the case.  A big part of change management is to identify and validate all perspectives. Fred and Alice are incapable of such insight.  What the author fails to tell us is that No No and his crack team of iceberg engineers have been studying the iceberg for years and have determined that the fissures actually serve to aid the iceberg during times of expansion/contraction.  While No No may not have been aware of the newly developed cave, his assessment of the fissures and the constant and consistent melting patterns of the iceberg are normal and have never posed any danger. If you want to get No No on your side, don't slam your skewed statistics and underdeveloped theory in his face.  It is far more effective to listen to his perspective, accept his knowledge and experience, modify your perspective using the new facts that No No has provided, then (respectfully) show him the evidence of the new facts of which he is not aware.  Chasing No No around and yelling at him is not effective change management.   I am especially concerned with the book's idea of creating a sense of urgency.  It sounded more like inciting panic and fear-mongering to me.  Another tactic used by those who have no real facts to rely on.  In a nutshell...Kotter is a nut-job.

B0011Z5N3C|5.0|come criticare quest'album?  troppo tecnico? freddo? poco lirico?  sono alcune critiche trovate nei magazines specializzati in rock-jazz e customer reviews.   io credo che ci si trovi di fronte ad un'opera quasi incriticabile. tale è la virtuosità e la compattezza delle performances strumentali. a volte difficile da capire per la grande complessità ritmica, quest'album è come un parco giochi dove ci si perde un po, ma il ludismo delle prodezze tecniche è genuino e accompagna ogni brano. perchè allora crucciarsi di non avere tutte le chiavi di lettura quando le porte del divertimento sono già spalancate?

B0042RJWTC|4.0|A very good, often very compelling series. I genuinely enjoyed and appreciated the care the show's creators obviously have for creating the feel of the times. Religious and sexual corruption go hand in hand to create the characters lives. Some liberties are taken with the historical content of course, but not much, and usually only when needed for dramatic emphasis. All and all it was really fun. I highly recommend it.

B000CDIOYO|5.0|Richter is the definitive interpreter of the St. Matthew Passion during the audio recording era, at least so far.  As a marginal note, it is delicious irony that the Roman Catholic resources of Germany produce the definitive presentation of this greatest of all Christian oratorios, and in this case, of Lutheran Pietism.  The second half of the 20th Century in Europe and the Americas produced the most definitive Bach interpreters and over-all most miraculous performance musicians imaginable:  Karl Richter, Glenn Gould, Rosalyn Tureck, Herbert von Karajan and Sviatoslav Richter.  Karl Richter's presentation of the Passion is religious, not merely musical.  He and members of the chori and orchestra he leads are believers.  The greatest possible professional skill, a miraculous score, genuine faith, dramatic setting, superb engineering and mixing  - this is the St. Matthew Passion truly expressed.

B005JU5JTI|1.0|I really, really wanted to like this film - even a little bit - as I paid top dollar to see it in the theater, but it was so 'bad' that I felt compelled to warn off others. \\"Bad Teacher\\" is simply one of those films that could have been better, but because it was so bad, it would be tough to know where to start fixing it.<br /><br />Cameron Diaz plays a character with no depth (not surprising or even a negative for this genre of films...), no like-ability and yes, she's a bad teacher too - thus the name of the film. Supporting cast including Justin Timberlake as a cute, rich, but nerdy co-teacher, are good enough, but you keep hoping for better and never get it. The story too is so simple, it really doesn't allow any of the characters to be built into much more than sketches of ideas versus characters you want to either loathe or cheer for in the end.<br /><br />One scene where Diaz's character redeems herself is cute, but the film neither offered up enough of those moments or really funny ones to make this viewer even slightly happy.  I stuck it out and watched the whole thing, but while a fan of stupid comedies and the actors in the film, if this was the only choice I had for something to watch - I'd read a book.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Great puzzle game.  I'm addicted!  The name's a ripoff of angry birds but the game isn't. IMO this is far better.
B005QUQRE2|5.0|Why didn't this film do better at the box office?  Was it the marketing or, was it was just too cerebral for most of the movie going public.  Perhaps the trailer gave the impression of unremitting and unrewarded suffering.  In the last case, be assured that there is true and well deserved redemption that comes with a twist at the end.  Whatever the problem was, the fault was not the film.  But, it prevented this movie from drawing an audience in numbers it should have.  And that is a shame.  Its failure at the box office will further dampen the spirits and limit the opportunities of truly original film makers.  Don't let this happen.  Buy this movie and reward intelligent, creative and thought provoking films that will provide a welcome relief to the normal mindless Hollywood fare.

Sometimes there's so much audience noise, and honestly, who wants to hear \\"OMG JOHN MAYER I LOVE YOU!!\\" every blessed time you play the blessed track?<br /><br />The quality of the singer and the recording is nothing less than superb! His live, unaudited voice is borderline flawless. Audience feedback is not overbearing, is controlled. His songs are filled with brilliant improvs & special solos that can only come from a live album.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is abhorrent.  Lucas should buy the Mona Lisa and add some more paint to it every couple of weeks.  I hear in the 3D version that the unmasked Darth Vader will now be a black guy.  There are many more changes than people think.  There are so many ridiculous additions in the scenes leading up to the bar scene that its unwatchable.  I couldn't get through the Episode IV.  This will stay in a drawer somewhere and go down as a waste of money.  I won't even bother to watch V & VI (Noooooooooo).  I-III are made for TV junk anyway.  Hayden Christenson was horrible to start but gets worse every time you see it again.  Those 3 are were ruined beyond repair the moment Lucas decided to direct them.    Anyway that is getting off topic.  This is ridiculous.  Worse than Woodstock on Bluray in which they re-mixed the songs adding new music from the kids of the musicians 40years after the fact.
B0013ND30W|2.0|I am a BIG DISNEY FAN and collector.  When I saw this title here on Amazon.com, I thought, \\"Oh Wow! I can get the Disney Blu-Ray/DVD Combo pack\\".  And so I went ahead and bought it.  But BEWARE!!!  I think someone must have photoshopped the picture which we can see from above.  YES, it is the 2 - Disc Platinum Walt Disney Sleeping Beauty 50th Anniversary Blu-Ray.  But there is no DVD with this title.  And it is not a Blu-Ray/DVD Combo pack.  As you can see in the picture the package clearly states nothing about a DVD.  When Disney does put out that kind of package, it would say, \\"INCLUDES BLU-RAY + DVD\\".  So the picture above has a picture of 2 discs on the side of the package to mislead the public.  If you do indeed want the \\"2-Disc Blu-Ray Walt Disney SLEEPING BEAUTY 50th Anniversary\\" edition, then this purchase is a great buy.  But don't be mislead into believing that you'll be recieving a DVD disc included with this package.  The picture of 2 discs being a Blu-Ray and a DVD were stuck onto the side of the title package.  If in doubt, always ask your seller before you buy.
B0041YI4ZO|3.0|I have Ip Man 1 and 2 and I think that Donnie Yen truly brings out any character he portrays. I appreciate what was said about Ip Man 3. It gives some structure to the world of \\"Chinese Martial Arts.\\" However, I am retired Navy and have been around the world. I was a Navy Corpsman working with the Marines and in my 20 years of service I can tell you that what you see in a movie is not exactly life. Movies are made to be enjoyed, to tell a story (good or bad) and to take you to another place for about 2 hours or so. But then you come back to reality. So I say this, \\"enjoy the movie and remember it's just a movie.\\" Oh by the way, I studied Okinawan Kenpo during my 5 years I lived in Okinawa and there are many different martial arts. However, it is the practitioner of the art that releases the true depth and meaning to what he or she has learned.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|WHY? the first thing i thought after seeing these movies again was how good they blended the new graphics into the old films. the old and new looked organically blended. the new background to mos eisley, with the cgi animals/creatures walkin alongside luke and obi-wan, looked so much better than their rerelease at the theatres. thought the graphics then were lame.  overall i trust lucas with HIS films. great story, great film.

Here Bosch starts on the streets on Los Angeles and winds his way to the border towns around Mexico.  There are twists and turns and the overall novel is really good.  I enjoyed this and look forward to reading the next in the series.

B004ZN9RWK|5.0|Pink Floyd's eighth album The Dark Side of The Moon was released originally in March of 1973.<br />The album would become the band's first number one album here in the United States of America and has stayed on the charts for nearly an accumulated 1,300 plus weeks (741 weeks from 1973-88 and many more now from 1991 - today where it still remains). Plus, The Dark Side of the Moon is the third largest selling album worldwide with some 40 million copies sold (including 15 million here in the US but should be updated for recertification now).<br />There is a good reason why this album has held up for the last nearly 40 years and it's because the songs deal with problems that one goes through in life and the production was many years ahead of its time. This was the first album that ever touched me in the heart, I used to go to sleep listening to Dark Side when I was a baby because lullabies wouldn't work half the time so when all else failed, my mother would put Dark Side on the turntable and it did the trick. Consequently, I became a die-hard Floyd fanatic, which I still am today.<br />The Dark Side of the Moon started out life as a piece called Eclipse and eventually became Dark Side of the Moon. Guitarist/singer David Gilmour's vocals and guitar solos dominate throughout the album as does keyboard player Rick Wright's keyboard work and harmony vocals.<br />This album has survived the test of time like no other album ever made before or since.<br />As everyone knows, the album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London between June of 1972 and January of 1973 with the band members producing and Alan Parsons (whom would go on to be a succesful producer in his own right) engineering the album with Chris Thomas (whom had worked with The Beatles and became a producer in his own right working with Pete Townshend, Roxy Music and The Pretenders among others) handling the mixing.<br />All of the songs dealt with different topics that one experiences in life like \\"Time\\" (with clock noises and about racing against or managing time) and \\"Us and Them\\" (a song about the perils of war and is still relevant today). Note: the music of Us and Them was originally intended for the 1970 film Zabriske Point during the riot scenes and was called The Violent Sequence but director Antonioni rejected it in favor of another Careful With That Axe Eugene entitled Come In Number 51 but was luckily resurrected for the album's best track.<br />Instrumentals like \\"Speak to Me\\" (featuring voices that are dominant throughout the album and with a heartbeat that was done on drummer Nick Mason's bass drum which opens and closes the disc) and \\"On the Run\\" which was originally a guitar jam entitled The Travel Sequence changed into this eight note Synthi-A VCS3 synthesizer pattern complete with tape effects and guitar noises. \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" was originally called The Religious Sequence/Mortality Sequence before it changed into this instrumental about death and dying and featured the excellent vocal phrasings of Clare Torry. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" (which was originally called Scat during the preliminary stages of the album) is excellent as well.<br />The other tracks are classics. Aside the aforementioned Us and Them and Time, you get classics like \\"Breathe\\" (which was originally written during the recording of bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters' first solo project The Body with different lyrics and music save the Breathe in the Air refrain), \\"Money\\" (which eventually became Pink Floyd's first American Top 20 hit and one of the few singles released with a 7/4 time signature and was about the pleasures and negatives that money brought) and the closing one-two punch of \\"Brain Damage\\" (a song referencing to original Floyd leader Syd Barrett and absent friends) and \\"Eclipse\\" (which sums up the album) wrap up this classic of an album.<br />Now as part of Pink Floyd's Why Pink Floyd? reissue campaign, this classic is reissued and remastered in three different configurations. This review is to the Discovery Edition of the album is just the original album remastered for CD by James Guthrie and Joel Plante and it is excellent (I don't know if either this or the Hybrid SACD are best CD issues I have heard and have heard them all (I thought the Mobile Fidelity version sounded like a bad conversion of the cassette to my ears), get the Mobile Fidelity Police out to arrest me) but the original 1970s vinyl is very hard to top)! The booklet is excellent and the packaging is somewhat original to the record with the original cover on CD and also the digipak is reminiscent to the original LP!<br />Highly recommended!ew is to the Discovery Edition of the album is just the original album remastered for CD by James Guthrie and Joel Plante and it is excellent (I don't know if either this or the Hybrid SACD are best CD issues I have heard and have heard them all (I thought the Mobile Fidelity version sounded like a bad conversion of the cassette to my ears), get the Mobile Fidelity Police out to arrest me) but the original 1970s vinyl is very hard to top)!

1612130283|4.0|It's a chance meeting that will irrevocably change their lives . . .  when Anastasia Steele's roommate succumbs to the flu, Anastasia `Ana' agrees to fill in for her and interview a famously reclusive entrepreneur for the school newspaper. When Ana and CEO Christian Grey meet, sparks fly. Christian is a young success story, but famously tight-lipped about his private life, having never even been photographed with a female date at the many charity galas and award ceremonies he attends.<br /><br />Ana is intimidated and intrigued - even more so when Christian continues to take an interest in her after the interview goes to print. Ana is quickly smitten - as well as ridiculously nervous and baffled by his flattery. Christian is rich, suave and damaged. He was adopted by an affluent family, but was born into a rough life before his rescue at four years of age . . .  as a result of childhood trauma; Christian has demons that Ana cannot even begin to fathom.<br /><br />Still, Christian and Ana find that they cannot resist each other. Even when Christian's strict rules for their relationship threaten to destroy them . . .<br /><br />`Fifty Shades' is the debut contemporary romance trilogy from E.L. James. The first book is `Fifty Shades of Grey', the second is `Fifty Shades Darker' and a third book is rumoured to have a January 2012 release.<br /><br />This book has gone great guns on Goodreads, Twitter and Amazon. For the last couple of weeks I was bombarded by images of these dark blue covers and raising my eyebrows at the many proclamations of love for a mysterious Christian Grey. Well, I had to know what all the fuss was about . . .  and now that I have read (/consumed/devoured) the first two books, I've just got to say I get it. Oh, I totally get it!<br /><br />Christian Grey is a dark and enigmatic leading man. He is a self-professed sexual sadist, suffering from haphophobia (fear of touch) and terrible night terrors. Furthermore, Christian has never had a proper romantic relationship. He has only ever had `subs', and he has been their Dominant. But when he meets Anastasia Steele, he wants more - he wants her and he'll do anything, give up his ideas of normalcy, to have her.<br /><br />Anastasia meanwhile, has never had a relationship either. She's just never met the right man, though she has had plenty of interest. Christian Grey is the only man who has ever caught her eye - she just didn't count on him having so many strings attached.<br /><br />E.L. James's `Fifty Shades' is an erotic contemporary romance, focusing on a Dominant who falls in love with a woman who is anything but submissive. I absolutely loved the first two books of this trilogy - they're packed full of addictive romance, angst, erotica and drama.<br /><br />James takes a pretty common romance/erotica exploration of the BDSM lifestyle, but she doesn't normalise it as many other authors do. For plenty of romance fans, reading BDSM Dom/sub stories is a bit of titillating fun - like exploring a foreign country that's exotic and interesting, but not anywhere you'd like to build a home. For the space of a book readers are willing to suspend disbelief and pretend like they'd be okay delving into this extreme lifestyle . . .  in reality, we'd probably have a similar reaction to Ana Steele - horror, confusion and feelings of inadequacy. It's a fascinating spin on erotica, infusing it with a healthy dose of realism as Ana reads (with horror) Christian's `rules' for being his submissive - among them a clause that says she's not allowed to look him in the eye, and must exercise four days a week with a personal trainer.<br /><br />But Ana doesn't want an `arrangement' with Christian that's devoid of romance, and she lets him know it. Christian has never been turned down - he has never been interested in a woman as combative and downright head-strong as Anastasia. And he likes it. He likes her, and will do anything, change his entire thinking, to be with her. Thus, the darkly damaged Christian promises to try and embark on a `vanilla' relationship with the sweet and innocent Ana.<br /><br />I love, love, loved this book! I was completely and utterly suckered into the story of damaged Christian and naive Ana embarking on a burning relationship. E.L. James has written a real heart-stopper of a novel, both for the many twists and turns in the plot (including one of Christian's ex-submissives going rogue) and the heartbreaking personal history of the leading man. Christian's history with BDSM is tragic and creepy, as he explains to Ana that he was introduced into the lifestyle at the age of 15 by one of his mother's (much older) friends.<br /><br />There was only one small aspect of the book that I didn't like, and that was Ana's constant references to her `inner goddess'. Both books are told from Ana's first-person perspective, and her inner goddess (recently emerged since meeting Christian) is like her conscience that she refers to whenever she's ashamed by her lusty goings-on with Christian, or elated with the progress of their more romantic relationship. This was cute in the beginning, but started to drag when it was constantly revisited.<br /><br />Both `Fifty Shades' books are thoroughly sexy and romantic. The sex scenes are smouldering, even more so when readers realize how out-of-character Christian's tender ministrations are, and how much he struggles with romance. Christian Grey is an amazing and enigmatic leading man, he's swoon-worthy yet dark and broken, and the best aspects of the romance come from reading his gradual acceptance of a mature and loving relationship, minus any power games. 'Fifty Shades' is my favourite contemporary erotica romance series of 2011 and E.L. James is a new and welcome addition to the romance scene. I can't wait for the third `Fifty Shades' book, but I have a feeling this series is just the beginning for James . . . she is certainly a romance author to watch, and I can't wait to read whatever else she has up her sleeve.<br /><br />4.5/5h the sweet and innocent Ana.

B004ZN9ERI|5.0|In August of 1967, English rockers Pink Floyd released their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in the UK and a month later in the US as The Pink Floyd.<br />This was the first introduction to a band that would conquer the world in a few years time. The band consisted of bass player/singer Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason (credited as Nicky on this album's original sleeve), keyboard player Rick Wright and guitarist/singer and main songwriter Syd Barrett, whom was the mad (as in \\"crazy\\") genius of the band.<br />The members of the band were in groups known as The Abdabs, The Megadeaths and The T-Set among others until Syd hooked up with childhood friend Roger and Roger's architectural school classmates Rick and Nick and another friend Bob Close to form the group The Pink Floyd which was named after two old Georgia bluesmen Pink Anderson and Floyd Council. Bob Close left after recording Syd's demo of \\"Lucy Leave\\".<br />Throughout 1966, the band were a concert sensation in London's underground music movement and proceeded to get a deal with EMI in Europe and was signed to EMI's US affiliate Capitol under the subsidary Tower (way before the record store chain existed throughout the US).<br />The band's first two singles were \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\" which were both Top 20 hits in England though did nothing in the US.<br />Then, the group's entered Abbey Road Studios to record their debut sometime in March of 1967 with producer Norman Smith, whom worked with The Beatles from 1962-65. Ironically, The Beatles were in the same building finishing their classic contribution to rock history Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br />All but one track on Piper at the Gates of Dawn was either written or co-written by Syd Barrett. His songs were whimsical works of art almost fairy tale and child-like in lyrics but superb.<br />The original UK album started with \\"Astronomy Domine\\", which was about going into space to explore the universe (strangely this song was eliminated off of the original American vinyl release). Next is \\"Lucifer Sam\\", a tale about a Siamese cat. \\"Matilda Mother\\" and \\"Flaming\\" (which was also left off of the original US vinyl release) follow and are great songs. Next is the first of two instrumentals \\"Pow R Toc H\\" which grabs the attention. Next was Roger Waters' first song written for the band \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\" which is a silly song with some excellent jamming.<br />The second half of the album starts with the instrumental \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" which was a number the band had played live before signing with EMI and was written by the band. \\"The Gnome\\" follows and is about a gnome named Grimble Crumble. \\"Chapter 24\\" follows and is my favorite Syd track. \\"The Scarecrow\\" follows and is a funny but great song. The album concludes with the whimsical \\"Bike\\" (also left off the original US vinyl release in favor of \\"See Emily Play\\") which then turns into a collage of sound effects and duck-call noises.<br />The album showed Syd Barrett at his best before his abuse of drugs, such as LSD, caused his behavior to become erratic and unpredictable and his songwriting skills started to sadly go down the drain.<br />The US version of the album hit the lower reaches of the Billboard Top 200 while the UK version hit #6 in England and the UK version would eventually be released in the US on the double album A Nice Pair in 1973 and properly on CD on its own in 1987. Now in 2011, as part of the Why Pink Floyd? campaign, the album is re-released for the second time in four years, once again remastered by longtime Floyd associate James Guthrie with digipak like packaging almost reminiscent to the original LP. I rank the remasters as the 2007 still first (for the stereo and mono mix) then this new remaster comes in close second followed by the 1994 remastered CD (for stereo mix), the 1997 mono CD remaster (in fourth) and the 1980s CD is last. The mono mix and the third disc of Piper will be included in an Immersion Version due out in 2012.<br />Excellent start to an outstanding career.2012.  Excellent start to an outstanding career.
B005N0PJJO|4.0|It's a chance meeting that will irrevocably change their lives . . .  when Anastasia Steele's roommate succumbs to the flu, Anastasia `Ana' agrees to fill in for her and interview a famously reclusive entrepreneur for the school newspaper. When Ana and CEO Christian Grey meet, sparks fly. Christian is a young success story, but famously tight-lipped about his private life, having never even been photographed with a female date at the many charity galas and award ceremonies he attends.<br /><br />Ana is intimidated and intrigued - even more so when Christian continues to take an interest in her after the interview goes to print. Ana is quickly smitten - as well as ridiculously nervous and baffled by his flattery. Christian is rich, suave and damaged. He was adopted by an affluent family, but was born into a rough life before his rescue at four years of age . . .  as a result of childhood trauma; Christian has demons that Ana cannot even begin to fathom.<br /><br />Still, Christian and Ana find that they cannot resist each other. Even when Christian's strict rules for their relationship threaten to destroy them . . .<br /><br />`Fifty Shades' is the debut contemporary romance trilogy from E.L. James. The first book is `Fifty Shades of Grey', the second is `Fifty Shades Darker' and a third book is rumoured to have a January 2012 release.<br /><br />This book has gone great guns on Goodreads, Twitter and Amazon. For the last couple of weeks I was bombarded by images of these dark blue covers and raising my eyebrows at the many proclamations of love for a mysterious Christian Grey. Well, I had to know what all the fuss was about . . .  and now that I have read (/consumed/devoured) the first two books, I've just got to say I get it. Oh, I totally get it!<br /><br />Christian Grey is a dark and enigmatic leading man. He is a self-professed sexual sadist, suffering from haphophobia (fear of touch) and terrible night terrors. Furthermore, Christian has never had a proper romantic relationship. He has only ever had `subs', and he has been their Dominant. But when he meets Anastasia Steele, he wants more - he wants her and he'll do anything, give up his ideas of normalcy, to have her.<br /><br />Anastasia meanwhile, has never had a relationship either. She's just never met the right man, though she has had plenty of interest. Christian Grey is the only man who has ever caught her eye - she just didn't count on him having so many strings attached.<br /><br />E.L. James's `Fifty Shades' is an erotic contemporary romance, focusing on a Dominant who falls in love with a woman who is anything but submissive. I absolutely loved the first two books of this trilogy - they're packed full of addictive romance, angst, erotica and drama.<br /><br />James takes a pretty common romance/erotica exploration of the BDSM lifestyle, but she doesn't normalise it as many other authors do. For plenty of romance fans, reading BDSM Dom/sub stories is a bit of titillating fun - like exploring a foreign country that's exotic and interesting, but not anywhere you'd like to build a home. For the space of a book readers are willing to suspend disbelief and pretend like they'd be okay delving into this extreme lifestyle . . .  in reality, we'd probably have a similar reaction to Ana Steele - horror, confusion and feelings of inadequacy. It's a fascinating spin on erotica, infusing it with a healthy dose of realism as Ana reads (with horror) Christian's `rules' for being his submissive - among them a clause that says she's not allowed to look him in the eye, and must exercise four days a week with a personal trainer.<br /><br />But Ana doesn't want an `arrangement' with Christian that's devoid of romance, and she lets him know it. Christian has never been turned down - he has never been interested in a woman as combative and downright head-strong as Anastasia. And he likes it. He likes her, and will do anything, change his entire thinking, to be with her. Thus, the darkly damaged Christian promises to try and embark on a `vanilla' relationship with the sweet and innocent Ana.<br /><br />I love, love, loved this book! I was completely and utterly suckered into the story of damaged Christian and naive Ana embarking on a burning relationship. E.L. James has written a real heart-stopper of a novel, both for the many twists and turns in the plot (including one of Christian's ex-submissives going rogue) and the heartbreaking personal history of the leading man. Christian's history with BDSM is tragic and creepy, as he explains to Ana that he was introduced into the lifestyle at the age of 15 by one of his mother's (much older) friends.<br /><br />There was only one small aspect of the book that I didn't like, and that was Ana's constant references to her `inner goddess'. Both books are told from Ana's first-person perspective, and her inner goddess (recently emerged since meeting Christian) is like her conscience that she refers to whenever she's ashamed by her lusty goings-on with Christian, or elated with the progress of their more romantic relationship. This was cute in the beginning, but started to drag when it was constantly revisited.<br /><br />Both `Fifty Shades' books are thoroughly sexy and romantic. The sex scenes are smouldering, even more so when readers realize how out-of-character Christian's tender ministrations are, and how much he struggles with romance. Christian Grey is an amazing and enigmatic leading man, he's swoon-worthy yet dark and broken, and the best aspects of the romance come from reading his gradual acceptance of a mature and loving relationship, minus any power games. 'Fifty Shades' is my favourite contemporary erotica romance series of 2011 and E.L. James is a new and welcome addition to the romance scene. I can't wait for the third `Fifty Shades' book, but I have a feeling this series is just the beginning for James . . . she is certainly a romance author to watch, and I can't wait to read whatever else she has up her sleeve.<br /><br />4.5/5h the sweet and innocent Ana.

0307932427|4.0|This was purchased to listen to during a cross country trip in the car. Because it is written in a non-linear fashion it was hard to follow during the drive. Very interesting information but probably better read than listened to.

B0012QTT4O|5.0|This show is one of the best TV series that I have ever watched. Within the first 10 minutes of the first episode I was thinking \\"There's no way this situation will be resolved,\\" but, in a mind-blowing fashion, I was proved wrong.<br /><br />I loved the first season so much that I bought the second season in HD (recommend it because this show has amazing filming that really stands out in HD).<br /><br />And, of course, Amazon does a wonderful job of making it available instantly and at a reduced price. Thanks Amazon!
0671027387|4.0|Dan Brown is a pretty good writer, I really enjoyed this book. Although some of the technology seems a little far fetched, it was still a great read. I like how Dan Brown puts in so much research, to ensure that what he is writing is indeed correct. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!
B005H8DEMG|2.0|I saw this film in Hollywood only because Helen Mirren was doing a Q/A after the film. I will pay to see any film she's in and looked foward to this one. My mistake was that I knew nothing about The Tempest, and for that matter very little about Shakespeare, so I missed a lot of the gags. Anyone who is in the same boat of me will not appreciate this film. I'd highly suggest reading the play before seeing the movie. The people around me who obviously were more familiar with the play seemed to enjoy the show. What I remember most about this movie were the bizarre trippy dreamlike scenes.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I had never watched even one minute of Firefly or Serenity, the tv show or the movie. Until today. I forced myself to watch this, more out of curiosity or boredom I'm not sure which, but mainly because Amazon just added it to Prime free streaming. Amazing show, totally amazing. Now i see what all the hoopla was about. That just paid for my Prime membership. Can't wait to watch the rest of season 1.
B000VRNCGQ|4.0|This album brings back great memories, primarily of a trip from Denver to Salt Lake City in the summer of 1969, where two of my best friends and I saw Blind Faith perform in the Salt Palace.  Ginger Baker, who left Cream the year before in a pretty wasted state, was in great form that night.  In fact, at the end of a Toad-like solo in Do What You Like, he brandished a bottle of milk and chugged the whole thing.  That's right:  Ginger Baker chugged milk.  Could there have been some other substance in it?  Maybe!  I agree with most of the reviewers here:  this album is severely underrated.  It was also \\"under received,\\" so to speak, because the expectations were so high.  Poor Rick Grech, having to hold his own in the presence of Clapton, Baker, and Winwood.  But this album really does work.  Sea of Joy, Well All Right, and the others; all very good.  But the real standout on this disc is the first tune, Had To Cry Today.  Clapton's electrifying opening riff, Stevie's soaring vocals, all punctuated by Ginger's percussion.  This is a solid disc, much more than just a historical curiosity.  These songs will make an impact and really stick with you.

B003L77GGU|5.0|Who would have thought that after Eric Kripke had stepped down that Supernatural would continue in such a wonderfully faithful way. I believed in Sera Gamble as she had written a few of my favorite episodes from previous seasons (Jus in Bello, anyone?). I call this an encore season because, more than before, oldies but goodies come back for new (and often final) performances. Folks you thought you never would see again come back not just for cameos and \\"Hey it's me\\" effects but are vital elements of certain episodes.<br />  I have to admit, though, that the first two episodes are painfully slow paced and have syrupy dialogue that sounds like it is from a Lifetime Channel Halloween Special. However, from the third episode on, the pace gets back on track and the new story arc is introduced. I liked that the arc wasn't as tunnel visioned as in Season 3 when you knew that nothing big would have happened until the final episode (I loved that season but you knew nothing would be resolved until the end which cut back on re-watch value). There are a few surprises not revealed til the very end which then gives rise to even greater questions.<br />  The balance of visits from long gone characters both old and new and an interesting and ambitious story arc make Season 6 a great season. Sera Gamble was very wise to not try to one-up Season 5 but go in her own direction and cut the way for giving non-demon or angel related monsters their due. I liked it. It's the first time I can say that anyone who doesn't even know about Supernatural can hop on the train and enjoy the ride while those who have been with the show since the beginning will find no end to Easter Eggs and Cookies in the form of recurring characters and underlying meaning for what has come before now.
0525951652|2.0|This book starts out wonderful, like an old fashioned, family saga. It draws you in with interesting details about the many families he is introducing. Just when Follet hooks you, he rambles on and on about the war and its politics and battles. If you are into world war one history you might like it. I only needed a bit of war and more of the human aspect. So disappointed because I thought it was going to be one of my favorites.

B005D0RDIE|5.0|I became a Rush fan at age 15 after hearing \\"The Spirit of Radio,\\" \\"Freewill\\" and \\"Jacob's Ladder.\\"  Searching back through the archives, I fell in love with this band with Hemispheres and A Farewell To Kings.  Digging further, I found a true sense of song with Caress of Steel via \\"Lakeside Park,\\" \\"The Necromancer\\" and \\"Didacts and Narpets.\\"  While many (including the band) regard 2112 as the passe-partout without which Farewell and Hemispheres would not have come to be, I found 2112 inspirational, whimsical and ambitious with Overture, Bangkok and Twilight Zone.    With my $8.50 general admission ticket in hand, I went to my first show in September, 1980 (the original Moving Pictures tour).  I was absolutely blown away with the sound of the band live:  note perfect as if I had dropped the needle on a pristine vinyl album.  The original \\"Atari Road\\" (not listed as part of the warm up tour, but was played) for Red Barchetta was scintillating, Xanadu amazing, and La Villa Strangiato for dessert.  While I do not recall The Camera Eye as part of the set, it is possible I missed it while chasing a skirt (or 4).    I did not see them again until 1983 in support of the Signals album (which many regarded as the Kilroy Was Here (Styx) for Rush).  Although awash with hard synth sounds and composition, I found the album stood firmly on its own.  Everyone knows Subdivisions, but few know Chemistry, Losing It, The Analog Kid and Digital Man; all strong pieces on their own.  Grace Under Pressure brought its own onslaught of great composition as did Power Windows (Afterimage, Kid Gloves, The Enemy Within; Marathon, Manhattan Project, Territories).    While Hold Your Fire and Presto had a greater mass appeal, the coup de grace for the effort of commercial appeal fell with Roll The Bones.  Make no mistake, all of these are great albums (Prime Mover, Mission; Anagram, Available Light; Ghost of a Chance, Bravado, Heresy), but it was good to see the guys get back to brass tacks and hard roots with Counterparts, Test For Echo and Vapor Trails.  While I was privileged to see the band twice on Snakes & Arrows, I've yet to truly GET the album (not surprizing; took me two years to get Test For Echo).    Nonetheless, I have NO DOUBT in my mind that this will be a release of Epic Proportions:  Moving Pictures Live; Front to Back.  I can't wait to see the guys back in action celebrating 30 years of one of my favorite albums.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game. It has beautiful graphics and is easy to learn, but also challenging and addictive. Great value!
B005LY4B0A|4.0|a challenging game, remaining fun as you pursue the elusive 3 star rating.  some are more difficult than others, of course.  One criticism I may point out is that the actual field of play is perhaps only 20% of my Galaxy tab screen size- the rest of the screen is an extension of the background.  the game is deserving of multiple resolutions for tabs and phones.  But, great fun and aesthetics.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|While the title itself serves as the first red flag, this was somehow overlooked by enthused anticipators of the elusive Malick's next feature film.  Something so generic sounding was clearly disregarded purely due to the fact of the acclaimed director's reputation as generally unconventional.  His previous works merit him the luxury of uncritical early reception, which is why no second thought was given to the cringingly simplistic title.  It is only in retrospect when this even presents itself as problematic to a work intending to be grandly philosophical and theological.        Throughout the entire movie, lies a tone of uncertainty and heartbreak though it is never specifically explored. Malick intends for the assumption to be held that this underlying, vague human torment is highly significant and universally relatable, and therefore should not be questioned.  Given, a movie should not hold the viewer's hand during the process of making interpretations and conclusions, but neither should it offer only one possible set of emotions and conclusions.  Upon watching this, we are supposed to feel the simplest forms of sadness and aimlessness without room for a wider range of alternatives. Though a bit of information is revealed early on about the death of a son, it is never discussed in a properly philosophical context.  Instead, a stream of clichés spews from this point on and marks the beginning of this film's disappointingly generic worldview.  While the movie intermittently features whispered narrations of various tortured characters questioning God--in simplistic fashion, of course--it never intends for a critical voice to turn against it in questioning why certain emotions are supposed to be felt.  A very one-dimensional view of growing up in a traditional 1950's household is seemingly the source of the deep suffering which leads to such profound theological doubt.  The father is strict and meant to be feared by his children, the mother is passive yet maternal and meant to be lovingly pitied by her children.  This historically conventional family structure presents itself--unconvincingly--as the cause behind contemplating the meaning of life.        An extension of delving into this broad, unthoughtful mediation on life features an unnecessarily long montage of abstract, nature images in desperate need of some proper editing--ironic since the film credits a total of five different editors.  It seems Malick was torn between making a nature documentary, a space exploration, and a narrative film. Naturally, he combined all three to make an incohesive, pretentious jumble of images clearly thought to be received as revolutionary and thought-provoking.  When he's not posturing as a National Geographic documentarian, Malick puts on his best impression of the untouchable Stanley Kubrick himself.  \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" stands the test of time and continues to marvel across generations without hollow flourishes forcing generic wordviews into the broad realm of art.  Needless to say, such a revolutionary landmark in the history of film did not need to be remade.  Countless number of films have derived significant influence from Kubrick's masterpiece, but there remains a distinct difference between subtle hints of inspiration and obvious attempts at redoctoring.  Trying to connect the cosmic history of Earth and life on it with the insignificance of one seemingly troubled American family proves incredibly feeble and a mere trifle in the grander scheme the film aimlessly hovers above.  The surprising addition of computer-generated dinosaurs firmly attests to the fact that Malick's vision lacks cohesive direction, appearing rather silly.  He overwhelmingly emphasizes the abstract imagery, so much so that the actors never believably connect with the material or with one another, thus preventing the viewer to connect with or care about the characters.  Rather than encouraging organic development between the characters and their environment, Malick pursues his own selfish mode of high-brow artistry.        With Malick's next project planned for release next year, it won't be long before disappointed viewers witness his next \\"revolutionary\\" undertaking; \\"Godfather\\" remade in 3D perhaps.

0143038583|1.0|Pollan does a great job of describing the vast and complicated process of food production in the United States (my complements end here...). However, his resultant conclusions are ridiculous. He says America overproduces food, and that corporations (as is repeated numerous times) \\"induce or trick\\" consumers into eating too much and becoming fat. This evil plot also supposedly hurts farmers who get menial wages because the overproduction of food depresses prices.  These ideas are literarily seductive, but they are inaccurate as can be explained by the simple laws of economics and logical analysis.  If there is a surplus and the market wage is too low for farmers to live comfortably, then many farmers will sell their land and leave the industry in order to work in other jobs. This will reduce supply, which raises the price of food (providing higher wages to farmers), and decreases the quantity consumers choose to buy. This natural self-regulation of the market would solve the problems of a surplus, in the event that farming wages were extremely low.   With regard to the corporations inducing individuals to eat more, Pollan is deceptive because he makes it seem as if consumers are forced to eat more food than they want. Sure, when food is abundant and cheap, people will freely choose to eat more of it. But as with any good or service, the happiness attained by these items decreases with each additional unit (i.e. law of diminishing marginal utility). When food is abundant, people will only eat more of it up to a certain point. So there is a limit to how much corporations could theoretically \\"force\\" people to eat. But in spite of these limitations, the key factor is that corporations do not force anyone to buy anything. The market is based on voluntary exchange where people freely make choices based on alternatives; corporations merely provide us with options. A successful corporation is one that provides the options to consumers that best fit their preferences, and thus better their lives.   Has Pollan ever considered that maybe some Americans like to eat more, and corporations better their lives by allowing them to make the choices that best fit their preferences? He constantly states that America is a nation of fat, and speaks about overeating as if it's a dirty sin. Who is he to judge others for their eating preferences, and employ a moral crusade about dining habits?  All of my analysis is based on the belief that people are rational and their decisions should be respected. Pollan insinuates a conspiratorial view of society, where Americans are helpless children, who are at the mercy of these evil corporations who force them to buy things they don't want.   It is this arrogant, elitist tone that made reading this book so difficult. It was so surprising to see Pollan's lack of appreciation for all that industrialization has done to raise modern living standards. Centuries ago, only the rich could afford meat, and everyday families struggled to provide subsistence. Now even the poorest in society can buy a cheeseburger for next to nothing. How does one not see the beauty of this progress? The incessant whining of Pollan should in reality be a profound appreciation of the progress and innovation of modern civil society.

Nathan Fillion just nails it as Rick Castle, a smooth-talking, best-selling murder mystery writer who has negotiated a deal with NYC's mayor to \\"shadow\\" Detective Kate Beckett, who is portrayed by the lovely and talented Stana Katic. Molly Quinn reprises her role as Castle's adorable, ambitious daughter, Alexis. She is a breath of fresh air and steals every scene she's in.

B004EPYZU8|4.0|Suckerpunch is one of those B movies that will end up being a cult flick, it's one of those types of movies they people love to watch again and again. Next thing you know after a fashion able amonut of time you stay hooked on it. The visuals are good (I'm a sucker for special effects). It is one of those sit back and just watch the flick. Don't go in with expectations or you will end up asking way too many questions about the logic of the movie. Some movies are made to entertain us  and \\"Suckerpunch\\" does exactly that. Although they killed off my favorite character with the train ride, all is forgiven.<br /><br />  I enjoyed the fantasy scenes, I am hoping that Abbie and crew make a second part to this movie. I want our lead character to exact vengance on all her oppressors. That is why I am hoping for a sequel. I am sufferring from the \\"I got more questions that need answering\\" syndrome, and I am hooked on the visuals. I also like the music score I think it fitted the scenes perfectly.  The female characters were cool to watch during the fight scenes kinda Matrix like in the right places. So yeah, buy the DVD  and put it in your favorites section of your collection. The more I watch it, the more fun it is to watch, in it's predictibility. All you need are your favorite snacks, that comfortable chair or couch and it's on.<br /><br />  There is nothing wrong with a little predictibily, especially when it is designed simply to entertain us for awhile. Suckerpunch succeeds in doing that, so I hope there will be a little more background in to the Wardens character, and the mean old fart who poisoned mom. if indeed there is a second movie made. I also want more of the fantasy scenes involving what the \\"old fart\\" is doing with his ill gotten gains, and and more on the dance teacher, hopefully our heroine gets even richer after she takes him out. Of course I would like to know more about what the other girls are  doing in the asylum too.  Cool Bmovie:)

0198326769|5.0|I have read a few books that I've wanted to get lost in and others where I felt no choice, no matter how scary the place but to get lost in. This was one of the latter.<br /><br />Bruno and his family must move from their home in Berlin because his father, a soldier, has been promoted to a very prestigious position. Bruno is anything but happy about leaving his friends and his family home and is quite determined to hate it there at his new home Out-With. But one day, when on an exploring adventure, his favorite, he meets a boy on the other side of a fence. A boy in striped pajamas. And this is their story.<br /><br />Anyone who knows anything about the history of our world...about humanity and the cruel things that have taken place all over the world knows with only a glance at the title and cover of this book what it is abot. But as the story unfolds, through the innocent eyes of a child, you'll find yourself piecing together what you know, and what you think you know. What you believed to be true, and what in fact is true. This book is not simply a story about two boys on either side of a fence. It is a book about you, the reader, being on the outside of the fence, being knowledgeable of only as much as you've read and seen without truly knowing of the horror that was experienced in those awful places so many years ago.<br /><br />John Boyne manages to write a very compelling and easy read through the eyes of a child, Bruno, that tells you a story we've all heard plenty of times in school and other places, from the other side of the fence. And where you'll find yourself at the end of the book...though you'll never be on the other side completely, maybe, just maybe you'll feel that you've lost a part of yourself there too.
B0054KCGCG|4.0|Every once in a while I like to read a book that makes me think...hard. This book fits that category. The thesis here is that customer experience is the new fourth economy, joining the farm (land), industrial and service economies. Pine and Gilmore wrote the first book in 1999 and this is the updated version. I didn't read the initial book, but this version concentrates on the new bent of creating an individualized experience around a product and selling it. In this economy, the product is secondary, the service is important, but the experience is king. Think Disney, Starbucks, Zappos, Wal Mart. Fascinating read, and being a Disney loyalist, I can relate to being a consumer of experience. If you are in marketing or PR, this will be a fun read.
B000RJW1Y2|4.0|It does what it is supposed to do and I have no complaints but I had one other one and it quit working about 6 months after purchase.  So the quality may not be  there.
B0019N94X6|5.0|This movie is a must have!! Any one who love gangster and/or action movies, this will be the one for you!
B0054IOWTS|4.0|Great movie with decent cast.  As it progresses, you can't believe that things can get worse (and they often do!).  What makes it even more incredible is that the entire movies is based on real events - amazing!  Plus - if James Cameron did it, can it really be that bad?...)
B001F290E4|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums!  I love Seal's voice and when combined with the choices of mostly Memphis music it is fabulous!
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|Decent action packed movie, but gets too long and slows down as it gets to the ending.  A nice few twists, however Liam seems tired and/or angry as he moves through the movie.  Worth a cheap rental.
B004G6009U|5.0|For a while there, I was getting worried about the new Disney films: too many of them seemed to treat crass, rude, selfish behavior as \\"cute\\" and \\"funny.\\" I understand that newer films might not want to be as sweet as the older ones (Snow White, Cinderella), but I was worried that Disney might not get that balance between saucy, fun, fresh, good-natured and caring the way that many Pixar films manage (Wally, Up).  I'm glad to say that Tangled does it. Half of the film is told from the point of view of the male hero (who is a bit selfish and untrustworthy at first) and half is told from Rapunzel's point of view (and she is a bit too trusting and insecure at first). Both characters grow throughout the film. Together, they manage to maintain a light and fun tone as they head from adventure to adventure while still showing genuine feeling (the musical numbers at the Snuggly Duckling and at the Lantern Festival are standouts for me). I don't know why the Disney did not advertize this, but the music is by Alan Menken (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast), and the score is quite wonderful.   The passive-agressive \\"mother\\" figure is another good character: children might be confused at first about her \\"love\\" for Rapunzel, but my 4 year old daughter now likes to whisper \\"she's lying!\\" and \\"she's not her mama!\\" as she watches the evil character's manipulations. The character taught my daughter that nice people may not be good at heart, which is an important lesson. The ugly characters at the Snuggly Duckling have taught her that people who seem not nice at all may be good-hearted and kind, also a good lesson.    I thought that this movie was funny and smart, with real feeling and hummable tunes. Although I've watched it about a hundred times, I still look forward to seeing it whenever my daughter puts in in the DVD player.
B0055PMUSU|4.0|Altogether this was a good movie, not great, but good.  It had an upbeat storyline with a solid cast.  It does stutter along at times, but it is definitely worth a rental.  It's especially suited for you, if you have a christian family and want to demonstrate to them how adverse situations can be positively handled and you can be a witness to others.  Lastly - it's based on a true story, which is always a little more interesting ~).
B0032JTV74|5.0|I didn't like it at first, but then some of my friends said it was cool. I started watching it after the 8th or 9th episode, and I started loving it! It's my favorite show on TV now!
B0052U59F4|5.0|This was an unexpected pleasure for me.  The love story is intense and I could not put it down.  I laughed out loud and also wanted to cry.  I agree with another posting that it is similar in some ways to Beautiful Disaster- another great book.  This story was more intense and a pleasure to read!  Cant wait to start Fifty Shades of Darker!
0634049011|5.0|I had this book one day and I'm already in love. I just started to learn to read music with various methods and this book has already expanded on that knowledge base 10 fold. The method introduced to learn the fretboard by patterns is pure genius. I felt overwhelmed by the explanations given in others books and their suggestions to memorize all the notes. Get this book if you want to get serious with the guitar. Just keep in mind that it actually is a workbook and you have you're work ahead of you. I copied the pages with a scanner and do the exercises repeatedly which really helps me.
B0053TMP24|3.0|I love the book! It has a rapidly moving plot, is filled with action, and has some terrific new characters. In places, it is very humorous. I can't wait for the next one. HOWEVER, I was appalled at the number of errors in the Kindle edition. It is full of typos, run-on-words, and poor spacing. This interfered with my enjoyment of the story. I can forgive an occasional mistake, but this was too much to ignore. If I had purchased a hard cover copy, I would have asked for a refund. I gave the story a 5 and the editing a 0, thus the 3 rating. I have yet to purchase a Kindle book without errors, but this was the worst.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is one of the best camera apps that I've found. Very simple to use and a great variety of effects. Love it!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I recently purchased the X41's mainly to use playing the Xbox 360 and PS3. Everything about the X41 is great. Easy setup, awesome sound quality, wireless. The games really come alive and feel very immersive. One of the really great features, especially for the Xbox 360 if you want to use HDMI to serve the video and optical to serve the audio to your receiver is the optical passthrough.  I was extremely disappointed though to discover some annoying popping and crackling coming from the headset. This was almost a deal breaker and I was about to return them. BUT I tried the following three things that completely eliminated the popping and crackling, at least in my experience.  1) Due to the way that the transmitter that comes with the X41 works there is an issue with routers using the higher end of the 2.4 frequency. The X41 uses the higher end to work. To eliminate this change you router settings to the lower end of the 2.4 frequency or to 5.  2) Replace to cheesy optical cable that comes with the X41 with a decent one.  3) Place or move the X41 transmitter as far away from your router and Xbox, PS3, etc. as possible.  The combination of these three things have worked flawlessly for me, no crackling, popping whatsoever. Your results may vary.  The X41 is a fantasic headset with a little tweaking.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|challenging fun game look forward to seeing there next game.  game has great levels and user submitted maps.  also like that I can edit maps and play them.
B005G4TJI4|2.0|First, I really enjoyed the movie. Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.  The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you.  A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab.  Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year.  From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes.  I haven't bought anything like this in quite some time.
B004SBBDB2|1.0|If you've read the reviews, you've gotten some ideas of the limitations. This cable may well be as good as the apple cable, but as far as giving you any kind of worthwhile av experience from your iPad, it's a bust.<br /><br />Hookup was strait forward--just look down 8 inches to the join to tell which red connect is which.<br /><br />While the problem may be a software issue with the iPad, the fact remains that the end result is that this cable won't deliver most of what you probably want it for.<br /><br />I could get very choppy Netflix performance (vs nice clear display with either my iPad screen or roku on tv) and acceptable YouTube performance--though you couldn't tell you tube was loading until you play an actual video.<br /><br />Neither hulu nor any of the network apps would display, though the cw was the only one that gave an \\"external display not supported\\" message.<br /><br />As other reviewers pointed out, you can watch slideshows but not individual pictures. If you stop the slideshows, the display stops altogether.<br /><br />Podcasts wouldn't play until I switched to another app, and then would only continue to play as long as you kept that unrelated app open.<br /><br />There's no mirroring and very little it will display. Again, this may not be the cable's fault, but the description gives no hint at the dramatic limitations.<br /><br />And since iOS 5 will be out in a week and promises to do pretty much the same and more without wires (though I'm sure it won't be as direct as the preview seems), this cable will be worse than pointless unless your device can't use the upgrade.
6305128952|1.0|Lousy excuse for a horse movie.  It's not.  It's another in a long line of Redford romances.  And not even a good or believable one, at that!  I saw it on tv and was angry enough to come to Amazon and check out the reviews.  Those who gave it high praise and 3, 4, and even 5(!!) stars certainly saw more to it than I did.  I thought I was going to see a story about the healing of a horrifically traumatized horse, by the horse whisperer.  But sadly, and to my anger, the horse is only used as the \\"hook\\" to get you to watch, and an excuse to bring Redford and Scott Thomas together.  Only a few minutes of the whole movie is devoted to the healing of the horse.  The rest of it is devoted to the romance.  The horse is forgotten, and only finally, at the end, miraculously, healed.  We don't get to see the actual method, or the interaction between horse and healer for more than a few minutes, because, sadly, that's not what the movie's about.  The poor horse is only incidental to a laughable \\"romance\\" between a very young Scott Thomas and a very old Redford.  I had decided after watching \\"A River Runs Through it\\" to never again watch a Redford movie.  I should have stuck to that.  If you like Redford romances, go for it.  But don't buy this thinking you're going to watch a moving story about a horse.  It's a movie about the horse whisperer-(Redford)-get it?
B0032UYFA6|5.0|The series is awesome.  One of the best things I've ever seen on tv (including the Simpsons).  The disc was delivered ontime and great condition.  I'm completely satisfied.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Just installed the newer Kindle for android on my Tablet. It wont even load.<br />The damned thing freezes while bringing up recommendations for me and cant bring up the<br />books on my device or in my archive. Pity I need them more than the trash that It keeps<br />recommending for me. Total disaster. I cant use my kindle books on my Android tablet anymore.<br />I hope i can find the old version somewhere, at least it was working.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Well filmed and extremely informative.  Made me crave for that change.  Also, made me disgusted by the power hungry companies and how our government does not do anything about the regulations.  Definitely changing my food lifestyle after watching this documentary.  A must watch!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I have done very few reviews and I am an avid reader. I am very impressed with the story and style of this writer! This is just an wonderful story, beautifully written and an absolute page turner! With so many junk books out there without writer's educated engrossing writing style, it was a total pleasure to discover Kate Morgan's book! I am planning to order all the other books this author has publshed. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS BOOK to you.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is a great little app. You can customize any picture in your gallery with unique effects. I would have paid for the app if it wasn't for free. Thanks Amazon!
B00005O3VC|4.0|Ordered new condition DVD. Arrived as promised, new.  Arrival was earlier than anticipated as a deadline was self imposed for an event, so crucial that DVD arrive on time. Great Job and will use same Amazon partner company for many of my DVD's
B003Y5H5K6|5.0|Will, who is an editor, is quitting his job so he can spend more time with his family in a newly purchased dream house. He spends most of his time locked up in his room writing. Rachel Weisz is the mom and they have 2 giggling/screaming daughters. There are things which happen in and around the house...the daughter claims there was a face in her window...dad finds footprints outside...the neighborhood teens play in his basement because this was the home to a man who killed his family. Now with the footprints...he is back!<br /><br />In order to get information he goes to the local coffee shop and asks some cops stuffing their face.(I didn't write this stuff.) Peter Ward, the father, survived the massacre and everyone in town believes he is a psycho killer...<br /><br />And then things escalate...<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. We have seen various aspects of this movie done before and to mention it, or to compare it to another film would ruin it. If you like a good pyschological thriller with a twist, watch this film without reading the reviews or the box. Well acted. Well written.<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.
1416562605|5.0|My favorite books are the ones that transport me from my world into someone else's and by that criteria, The White Tiger is 100% successful. It also happens to be an exceptionally well written novel. Mr. Adiga has had the advantage of living both in and out of India and although his book is written from the more limited perspective of a character from the \\"Darkness\\" of rural India, the writing is informed by an intimacy with the West. Because the novelist knows all about our world he can better show us the one he is from and reveal its curious details. The plot was highly unpredictable.   The novel succeeds on multiple levels and it is obvious why it has been of great interest to readers everywhere. This is a dark, dark novel made somewhat more palatable by its gallows humor. It is not a flattering picture of a nation emerging from what Westerners condescendingly refer to as The Third World -- the author's perceptions of his homeland are as harsh as the conditions he describes. I'm interested to learn what the response was in Mr. Adiga's home country, if he angered many people or was seen as treasonous. It is obvious in America, with the number of Indian scientists, technicians and doctors working here, that India offers the world an unending flow of brilliant minds, but this book is further proof that many of our greatest writers in the English language are Indians.   This novel has been out since 2008 and I don't know why I didn't read it sooner.
B00466HN86|5.0|Superb, their best yet!  God is truly speaking to families through this film.  We laughed, we cried, we came away totally blessed!!!  This is a must have/must see movie.
0316098329|5.0|When one starts reading this book one does not know what the book may be about...but then it all starts making sense.  The book is written in the voice of the occupant of the ROOM...but until it is revealed what the ROOM is about it is all a mystery.  I believe that this can be a true story of one being kidnapped and forced to succomb to the wishes of the kidnapper.  A truly provacative story.  All of my friends are reading it and also love it.  You can't put the book down until you are finished reading it.  Truly an exciting book.  pink golfer
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is great App, it doesn't require any intrusive, rediculous or unnecessary permissions that can leave you open to being violated. It would be nice tho if it could be moved to the memory card to free up unnecessary memory being utilized on the phone.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This product works as advertised, but leaves to be desired the satisfying 'click' of on/off, so you can't tell for certain if the button functioned or not.  This is a different brand of mag-light on/off switch I had from before; the previous one was rubberized and you knew that it had been depressed.<br /><br />I'm giving this a 4/5 rating for functionality and use, minus one star for that one complaint.  Since this is all I could find on the market, I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for this function; I just miss the previous switch I had before.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Got  this when it was the FAotD... after using it for a bit, I can honestly say that it is worth $1.99.   The app runs slow on my phone, but I suspect that is due to my phone and the other apps that run on it.  Moto Droid 1.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I've been wanting this app for so long and was ecstatic when I saw it was the free app of the day. The effects are incredible, no other app rivals it, the sketch up one looks amazing, so real. Get it while its free.  The pictures dont show it but there is a little share icon to share your photos as well.
B005J0VPNC|2.0|I like this app for the picture taking aspect, the images look really cool. However there is lagging issues as well as picture browsing issues. The latter half annoys me more because it does not show the image that I choose, instead it shows some random image from the camera roll and sometimes even an image from the cache from other apps. If it doesn't show an image at all, then it will just go back to the camera screen like how it first starts up. Please fix this issue, this app deserves 5 stars but I can't rate it higher because of this issue.
0385528752|5.0|This book was recommended by my manager. Our team of 6 leaders in software development use this vocabary and framework to shape and guide our strategies and decisions.

B0042RUMIW|5.0|Like most all the other reviewers here, I agree with this being one of the best live DVDs I have ever seen.  The song arrangements were all similar to the album versions but with an amazing backing orchestra.  It is amazing how Sting's voice has held up so well over 30+ years.  Just an amazing show.  I could not give this a higher review.  Wish I had seen it live.  Get it now!

B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This is the second Disney 3D movie i've bought that doesn't play on my PS3. All my firmware is updated, the PS3 is an earlier model but it plays all my other 3D movies and games perfectly. The TV is a 3D Samsung as well, so there's no reason it shouldn't work. Disney have a very basic, almost patronizing troubleshooting section that just tells me to change a basic setting, which does nothing, and Sony's page isn't any better. I know there are more people out there that have this issue, and if you figured out how to fix it, please leave a post! Very frustrating!  UPDATE: Totally reset everything, took all the cables out from my receiver to the TV and PS3 and ran directly from the PS3 to my TV. Long story short, that did the trick. Don't know why it didn't like running Disney 3D, but it does now. The movie is probably the best 3D i've ever seen, even Avatar. Fantastic!
B00004XQ83|5.0|The CD is everything we hoped it would be, and it arrived in perfect condition. We liked the music in the movie, and enjoyed a radio broadcast review before we looked for it, and found it, on Amazon. Thank you Amazon.
1400052181|5.0|I had a difficult time putting this book down.  Not only is it a fascinating story about a black woman with cancer in the 1950's, but a look into life back then regarding medical treatment and the research that went on.  The author spent 10 years of her life with endless medical research, as well as patiently getting the background and truth behind the contributions to science and the human side of Henrietta's family.  Thank you for letting us know Henrietta Lacks!
B001CC7PPI|5.0|Out of all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, this is definitely my favorite next to a few others. This film sticks out so much because everything is perfect. The acting, the actors (James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr), the Edith Head costumes, the music, the sharp dialouge, the terrifying ending, and of course, suspense like no other. Everything about the film is absolutely perfect, and I think it's one of the greatest suspense films ever made. This movie is what Hitchcock would call \\"pure cinema\\".    The film is about a photographer named L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries, who broke his leg in an accident and, while confined in his apartment, has nothing else to do but stare out his window and look into other people's apartment rooms. Later on, he suspects that his neighbor right in front of his apartment building, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), murdered his invalid wife. Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont, who helps Jeff investigate the murder, along with his homecare nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), who provides the typical Hitchcock comic relief in the film. Wendell Corey plays Detective Tom Doyle, who is skeptical about the whole murder theory.    This film has the perfect amount of suspense, and even though it takes place all in one room, it's still so suspenseful. It gradually builds up scene after scene all the way to the shattering conclusion, that you'll think about way after the movie is over. This is an ultimate Hitchcock masterpiece, along with some others, like \\"Psycho\\", \\"Vertigo\\", \\"North by Northwest\\", and \\"The Birds\\".    The Universal Legacy Series edition of this film is absolutely phenomenal. The film does look pretty grainy, but other than that, it looks beautiful. The Disc 1 comes with the film (of course), a commentary by John Powell, production notes and photographs, along with the theatrical trailer and the re-release trailer. The Disc 2 comes with a 55 minute documentary \\"Rear Window Ethics: An Original Documentary\\". It talks about how the film was made, and it's extremely interesting. It also comes with a 15-20 minute interview, titled \\"A Conversation With Screenwriter John Michael Hayes\\", a very interesting 25 minute documentary about Hitchcock's films \\"Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master\\", with different directors talking about his films, a very similar 25 minute documentary about the music in Hitch's films, \\"Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock\\", a 15-minute Hitchcock/Truffaut excerpt with Hitch talking about \\"Rear Window\\", alongside showing parts from the film and some photots, and it also comes with an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, titled \\"Mr. Blanchard's Secret\\", which has a very similar plot to \\"Rear Window\\" (somebody believing their next door neighbor is a spousal murderer.    Altogether, if you don't own \\"Rear Window\\", the Universal Legacy Series edition is the version to get! It has great special features, along with an amazing packaging, and of course, a breathtaking masterpiece of a film. \\"Now where do ya suppose he cut her up? Of course! The bathtub! That's the only way he coulda washed away all the blood!\\" (My favorite quote from the movie!)
B001229W22|5.0|This album has no weaknesses. If you absolutely have to pick songs for weakness sake, then they would be, in my opinion, Leper Messiah and Disposable Heroes. But really, even those two are so far and beyond their musical peers, that its just not an issue people usually mention. This album influenced more metal than even any Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin album. You listen to the kids today and check out all the staccato down picking they do: Metallica. Check out all the big mighty opuses they try and emulate: Metallica. What about all the drop tune fret work they all like? Metallica. And it all comes down to this album here. They all heard it here first and if they heard it elsewhere, the band they heard it from heard it here first.<br /><br />Ride the Lightning would have been good enough to secure them as one of the greats. But Master of Puppets secures, at the very least, greatest metal album of all-time.

B004SUWR2C|3.0|The traditional game play of UNO plus the additional rules and modes give theis game a great deal of play ability, but the visuals are remenicinent of an 8-bit Nintendo game. I agree with others that for .99 this game is worth while, but deffinately lacks the polish to command 2.99
0385344325|4.0|Now, after reading this prequel book, I know how the Jack Reacher story began.  The book is set in 1997 and most of the action takes place in a small town in Mississippi.  Reacher (an Army Major who is an MP) is sent on an army secret mission to determine whether or not the killing of a local woman in the small town of Carter Crossing was done by a local or by someone from the nearby base.  And Reacher finds himself in a real hornet's nest with more than just this one young woman dead.  He knows that secrets are being kept and it takes all his skill and training to get to the bottom of it all.  And on the way he meets the local Sheriff.  With her help and with the help of another Army MP Major, they manage to take care of business in the typical Jack Reacher way.  I love Child's laconic and laid back style of writing.  He gets a lot said in an economical use of words, and the technique is very effective.  No one can build suspense like he can.  His Jack Reacher creation is iconic and unforgettable.

0451232577|2.0|I give Follet credit for compiling almost 250,000 coherent words together into this book. He has shown readers throughout his many novels that he certainly masters the art of writing. With that being said, I felt it was challenging almost daring to get to the last page of a novel that was predictable from its early pages. Aside the character of Walter, I found most characters indifferent and unlikable. The chronology of WWI and its onset it is painstakingly written, as if we were reading a history enciclopedia, with fictional characters entwined in historical pivotal moments where Lenin, Churchill, Wilson, or Lloyd had their mark. But still, as a novel, it was a tedious and boring read.   I end the reading of the series with this first book, since I would not put myself through another 1000 pages of much known world history with uninteresting and unsympathetic characters.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|What can be said except that this app rocks. Pictures are wonderful and the fact that I can change existing pictures with the filters is another huge plus. Good job.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Adds great perspective on a photo and works with downloaded photos. Definitely download worthy of the price. The creator of the application did a great job.
1933308087|1.0|The book is beautiful. The collection almost exhaustive, the instructions to understand how to lay the cool plastic overlays atop each photo to see each piece was neat. But I had no clue how to turn the photo into a real block.  That's probably not an issue for experienced quilters, but all that is beside the point. As I was paging through the index, i made a disturbing discovery; Beyers decided to include a swastika block. Seriously?? With the incredible baggage that symbol holds for so many, she felt it was important to include???? I did not find any Star of David blocks, so it clearly wasn't because she felt she needed to include all blocks ever created.  I was left wondering if this was a subtle way of communicating her beliefs. Maybe she doesn't think the Holocaust happened or was unaware of how painful and hateful that symbol is for most people? Anyway, had I seen that before I shelled out full-price for her book, I would not have bought it, and since I purchased it at a workshop of hers (very well done and helpful) and not a particular store, i felt I had no way of returning it to get my money back.  Sorry, Ginny: i don't know you personally, but since our actions are what most folks use to judge our character, I can tell you I will not be giving my financial support through anymore book purchases or workshop fees.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|I like the app, but the Google Market version has been updated beyond the version available here. I'd be really upset if I'd paid for it.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|Product as stated in the description..Excellent purchase all around. I recommend using Amazon as a source for just about any online purchase that you can think of !!
B003PIUC02|5.0|Excellent casting, good story-line with good plots! Also the special effects are great! Unfortunate that Andy has passed on...  Great series! Watched the prequels! Wonderful series! Looking forward to more! Its strong story line with good effects, good characters and depth! Well done!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Tested on HTC G2 with Android 2.3.4  Great app, if you like having fun with photo effects in the slightest get this app! Well worth the small asking price of admission. There are about a dozen different types of effects that you can apply to your photos that will make them really pop. Some of my favorites are the black and white film noir style, the exaggerated comic book style, the charcoal drawing style, and the neon sign style. You can be sure that all of them bring something visually unique to make your photos more fun/stylish/artistic/visually stimulating... whatever you want to call it I like it. I like it a lot.   Biggest surprise for me was that I could apply all of these effects to older regular photos on my memory card taken with my regular camera app and it will not damage the old photo of course, it saves the new stylized photos as a new photo. Just click on the green menu button and select photos off your memory card then apply your effects till your hearts content!  On the downside: It does take just a fraction of a second longer changing between the styles than I would like, and it takes a few seconds to open up the first time your open it. I might be in the minority but maybe a more simplified or slicker UI would be better, I better go look and see if that's available in the settings... Nope I just looked, the only two options in the menu are: sharing the app with your friends and contacting the developer. And then of course there are the options to adjust: contrast, brightness, and lines in the image you are editing, they are little sliders right on the screen not hidden in a menu.   Really these are very minor quibbles I have a year old phone and it's producing such great effects that I would never rate it down for any of these reasons. Love this APP!
B005F6NA5G|4.0|So you looked at my rating and scratched your head or even got really angry and yelled: How dare you? (OK! so it's really four and a half.) The reason I dared to do what I did is simple. The overwhelming dominance of 5-star customer reviews for everything that George Benson ever recorded makes me wonder what it would take for some of those reviewers to ever rate something less than five stars... It must be nice to live in a world where everything is perfect. Undeniably this album is perfect when it comes to the production detail and the technical quality of recording but... when it comes to the choice of repertoire it fails at least twice. Listen to the 1971 White Rabbit (a take on the Jefferson Airplane's repertoire) for example and compare. A ground-breaking visionary recording versus conservation and some recycling. Sorry to say but \\"My One and Only Love\\" sounds to me like a cheap imitation of the Coltrane/Hartman's version and so does \\" Since I Fell For You\\" of the Al Jarreau's version. \\"Don't Know Why\\" is a better take maybe because it's not sung and also it's not an exact copy of the overplayed original. In general all solo guitar and small group tracks come off better than the production numbers with an exception of \\"Fingerlero\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed mostly because it had lots of new unexpected twists and turns in Benson's signature sing-n-play unison lines. This album will certainly please every smooth jazz fan on the planet but may not be as satisfying to the ears of those who know George Benson as an explorer of new sounds and a pioneer of the soul-jazz guitar we used to hear on CTI, Verve, Blue Note and Columbia.
0790737345|5.0|Every morning at sunrise all the angels of Los Angeles are meeting on the Pacific Ocean beach to listen to the music of dawn. These angels are there to welcome and accompany dead people to the other side of this life. We can't see them, we can't hear them, but some of us can feel them, sense their presence because some of us are angels who chose to become human.<br /><br />We all love angels and we all have angels in our lives, human terrestrial life or eternal life or mental and spiritual life. What we don't know is that some of the angels we are in love with are real angels but it would change nothing in our minds because these angels of ours are soul friends, soul companions and soul mates. Sometimes it does not work both ways and the angels of mine do not consider me as an angel for them but it does not matter because an angel is a creature of the mind.<br /><br />So we live with those angels who inspire us and we must keep in mind they do not have wings and we do not become winged angels by becoming their angels and yet they can fly. They are right in front of me any time I ask them or summon them. They haunt my mind and my heart and I cannot live without them anymore even if they are inhabiting my soul.<br /><br />That's what this film is all about. A real angel decides to become human out of love but the woman he loves and loves him is so haunted by that angel face of his that she imagines she is able to fly, on her bike mind you. No one has a second chance. She will meet with her fate and he will have to remain human.<br /><br />Touching film though slightly romantic, sweet, mellow, close to melodramatic at the end.<br /><br />Remember you do not need to believe in angels because they do not exist because we believe in them. They exist all by themselves and they are happy when we know they exist for our sake, otherwise life goes on and an angel's life is eternal: he will see billions of dying men and women and children in his eternal life. And every morning he will come to the beach to salute the sun rising in the East, in their backs, over the Rocky Mountains.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUng in the East, in their backs, over the Rocky Mountains.

B005H1SDQU|5.0|Purchased as a down load this review covers only the first CD. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that I missed seeing the down load that had both CDs on it. My bad.   \\"More of the same\\" with Steve Hackett is a good thing! \\"More of the same\\" means a tremendous variety of virtuoso performances by a musician who is only getting better with age. While many seem to get complacent, Steve continues to push himself, experiment with varied musical styles and add finesse and refinement to his virtuoso guitar playing after over 40 years of plying his trade.  \\"Beyond the Shrouded Horizon\\" is probably the most appealing Steve Hackett album I had the pleasure of listening to in the past decade. (and I have listened to them all) Steve Hackett will generally garner four star ratings from me but in comparison with his other albums I must give BTSH five stars. I find myself just stopping, tuning everything else out, and just listening to it.     This album is epic in nature. NEVER boring. It blends seamlessly between strong electric guitar, electronic, acoustic,classical, and fully orchestrated numbers. Many of the songs blend into each other with no pause between tracks making some series of songs more like suites. Steve brings in Chris Squire (Yes) on base for several numbers and incorporates female vocalists on a couple of numbers. A wide variety of guest musicians (enhancing his normal band mates) keeps each song fresh and different. Songs range from rock, to blues, to ballads, to world beat. Orchestrations on some numbers make them rich but never overpowering. The final cut on the first CD \\"Turn This Island Earth\\" is nothing short of stunning! This CD, simply put, is marvelous!  Never bought a Steve Hackett album before? Start with this one. Many want to take you back to his Genesis and early post Genesis works, but with this CD I have to say to start here!  I had to append this paragraph to my original review because I feel the final number \\"Turn This Island Earth\\" deserves some special attention.  The closing song  \\"Turn This Island Earth\\" is one of the more adventurous pieces I have ever heard Steve Produce. It almost defies description but I owe it to myself to at least try. I choose the word adventurous over experimental because it manages to touch on a plethora of \\"existing\\" musical styles during its over 11minute run, all of which are recognizable. The overall effect becomes a series of movements, not unlike semi-classical music. It starts off with a slow haunting synth and bass string sound which is accompanied by Steve's classical guitar, this moves back to the slow synth and strings sound which morphs into electronically enhanced vocals (much like those used by Jeff Lynne and ELO) and then the catchiest synth line I have heard in a long while introduces the heart and chorus of the piece. This then evolves to a \\"blistering\\" electric guitar movement, which changes to an orchestral accompaniment before it returns to the synth line and theme of the song again. This then, rapidly, turns back to classical guitar only to also be rapidly replaced by Gershwinesque and avant-garde full orchestral soundscapes. Inserted into the middle of these soundscapes is a short, seemingly separate, song but not at all unlike that heard on \\"A Day in the Life\\" by the Beatles. It just fits! The piece ends by returning to the original theme and synth line, although briefly, to end the song.  The overall effect becomes almost a hypnotic  roller coaster ride that beckons to be heard again and again.  One can sense the trials, joys, hustle, calm, and calamity that are all happening at once across this planet floating in space.
0765324857|4.0|I've been a die-hard fan of Bioshock for two and a half years now, and I've played through it four different times. I've read everything I can get my hands on when it comes to the history of Rapture, and I write about it extensively. When I found out there had been a novel published that existed as a prequel to the events of the game, I purchased it without a second thought. I've rated this book four stars, and I'll explain first what made this book positive for me and then what I wish would have been improved.<br /><br />Shirley has woven us a story that fits so well with the game that it could have been written by one of the game writers themselves. He sticks to the game's characters, atmosphere, era, and imagery to a T. I even think he improved on several characters, namely Dr. J.S. Steinman and Sander Cohen; Shirley delved into their inner mental workings and therefore made them about twice as gruesome as they were in the game. He also answered several big questions that existed for me, namely the details about ADAM and EVE. I learned that they were far more unstable and addictive than I originally thought, and the side effects were nothing short of stomach-churning. He also illustrated Frank Fontaine's past extremely well and gave him more of a villainous aura than simply being an antagonist who comes jumping in near the middle-end of the game. I appreciated that Shirley was not afraid to write some pretty brutal scenes, namely the exploits of Dr. Steinman, but he stuck to the true colors of the game.<br /><br />As for things that fell short, I feel that there was not nearly enough focus on Bioshock's voiceless protagonist, the unlucky Jack Ryan. We only see Jack for a couple of pages, when he is an infant floating in an incubation tank, but that cuts off any and all mention of him. There's no detail of who put Jack onto a sub and sent him up to the surface, what he did while he was topside, or how he ended up on the plane that flew over the Atlantic. One of the main reasons I purchased the book was because I read it was a prequel, and instantly thought that we would finally see how Jack came to be. I was disappointed because Jack was such a vital part of Bioshock. The ending of the novel felt a little rushed to me and left a lot of questions unanswered, namely what happened to Atlas between his revolution and his falling into hiding. I feel that this novel would have been more powerful and complete if it had finished right before Jack's plane went down; there seems to be some lost time between the novel in the game.<br /><br />Balancing the pros and cons, though, I recommend this book to anyone who loves Bioshock. This is such a momentous game that has stood out boldly among so many others, and the story is a vital part to its fame. And I applaud Shirley for tackling such a spectacular tale, for publishing a novelization of the Bioshock prequel is no small feat. He was definitely a success.chased the book was because I read it was a prequel, and instantly thought that we would finally see how Jack came to be.

B004GCPJDQ|3.0|The bad news the first release of batteries was unreliable: I had two fail. The good news: this company has superb customer service, shipping me replacement batteries as soon as I emailed them that I had returned the defective ones. They even exchanged one without my having to go through Amazon first (I bought the other through Mobee directly). The new batteries also fit better than the first issue. And now that I've cleared that initial hurdle, I can report that the product works superbly.

B005HHSXP0|5.0|This book took off right where it left us in the previous one, but in Percy's point of view!!!!<br />Percy gets to the roman camp, makes some excentric friends and gets a quest. A typical day in the life of a demigod. Especially if your name is Percy Jackson.<br />I loved this book. Being a fan of the Percy Jackson series, I was overjoyed when I realised that the narrator was going to be Percy.<br /> However, Percy isn't the only one talking. There are is friends Hazel and Frank who accompany him on the quest. They are both unique, funny and interesting. And do they like each other??<br />But there still is something that is bugging me: Hazel has a &#34;Secret&#34; and Frank has some weird/cool powers. Remind you of anybody? Maybe Leo and Piper, Jason's sidekicks?<br />We discover each of their personalities through out the book, and learn to love them. And Percy is still same old Percy. Cute, funny, and totally oblivious. He only remembers one face from his past: Annabeth. Slowly, he starts to get his memory back while every reader is cheering him on. In the end, we even get some Tyson time!!<br />There are other new characters in the book. Reyna, Jason's used to be girlfriend; creepy Octavian; Thanatos, also known as Death and crazy Dakota, son of Bacchus, also known as Mr D. Hehe.<br />This book, while not as fastly paced as the other one, was incredibly funny. Sometimes I burst out laughing and I couldn't stop!!<br />Though I am aware that some character development is missing, the story isn't as fastly paced as the others and I honestly prefer a story told in the first person, I give this book five stars.<br />Why? Because this book was good in it's own way. Plus, with so many new characters having to be introduced, I can understand the lack of action in the beginning. The humour made up for it.<br />At the end of the book, which is a cliffhanger, by the way, you are left with so many questions. What's the deal with Hazel and Leo? Hazel and Frank? Why is Annabeth going to be troublesome? How is Reyna going to react to Jason and Piper??<br />The answers will be in the next book, The Mark of Athena, coming out in 357 days and counting!!yna going to react to Jason and Piper??  The answers will be in the next book, The Mark of Athena, coming out in 357 days and counting!!
B0052WSX32|5.0|If this isn't quite the  \\"new Doris Day record\\" full of new performances one might hope for, it's still a beautiful addition for anyone who enjoys this special singer. Her version of \\"Hurry, It's Lovely Up Here\\" made me wish time could have been turned back to allow her to play Daisy in \\"On A Clear Day,\\" from which that song comes. Her swinging \\"Daydream\\" is another delight. As is each song in this collection.  She always had a special sound, a beautiful voice that brimmed with a life affirming quality. Until impossibly wonderful things happen and Doris Day is out there singing for us again, well until then MY HEART made my heart feel grateful listening to her.   Thanks, Doris. Love ya.

B0018LMZOO|4.0|The Moody Blues represent what is mostly missing from today's music: heartfelt lyrics and songs with meaning. It's very nice how the songs on Seventh Sojourn flow together, not unlike most of the other Moody Blues albums. I'm Just A Singer In A Rock And Roll Band is a song that might still get airplay here and there - it was (still is) a wonderful hit song.
0061537969|5.0|It is a heart warming story written from a dog's point of view.  Don't be scared away as it truly is unconditional love, devotion, and a sense of emotional needs between humans & pets. The author has done a marvelous weaving of characters in this book to create a memorable reading experience.
0385344325|3.0|The fictional character Jack Reacher, who Lee Child created more than a dozen novels back, remains something of an enigma to readers. His backstory is the focus of the latest Reacher novel, The Affair. Set in 1997 when Reacher was in the Army, this novel sends him to Mississippi to investigate a murder that might be linked to a soldier. The local sheriff, Elizabeth Deveraux is also ex-military and she and Reacher understand each other. Reacher's integrity leads him to uncover the truth wherever it leads, and in Child's capable hands, readers are unsure about the truth until very late in the novel. Fans of thrillers and Reacher are those most likely to enjoy this fast-paced and entertaining novel.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

B004ZN9W5M|5.0|This remaster of \\"The Wall\\" is a bit louder than the Mofi version of the album but, on the whole, James Guthrie (a long time collaborator with Pink Floyd) has done a nice job of eliciting as much detail and depth for a 16 bit CD as possible. Unfortunately, as much as I would have liked to wait on the \\"Immersion\\" set because of the extras (demos, Blu-ray, previously released live discs), I can't justify spending that kind of money to myself so ended up picking this up again to replace my Mofi which was damaged.<br /><br />I purchased this set to replace my Mofi version of the album on CD. Is this as good as the Mofi? No, but for a new remaster it actually sounds pretty good. The packaging is qutie nice redesigned for this latest CD release.<br /><br />I am disappointed that EMI has chosen (and the band members) NOT to reissue this with bonus tracks for the regular edition (the the two discs run around 81 minutes combined)is pretty inexcusable but not a surprise given that this is Floyd which, The Beatles, Stones and Eagles aside, are among the biggest selling artists out there.<br /><br />Although this isn't my favorite Pink Floyd album, there's no denying the power of the music the band came up with on its last release to feature Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright. As most fans are aware Wright was no more than a hired hand here (he had been fired by the band)and Waters who had increasingly begun to dominate the band's musical and lyrical direction continues to do so here. It's still very much a band effort though (as much as I love and enjoy \\"The Final Cut\\" the final effort from the Waters led edition of the band, it's almost a Waters solo album with Gilmour and Mason more in the role of sidemen).<br /><br />Bottom line: Is it worthwhile buying this again if you have it? I suppose that depends on how much you love the album the sonic upgrade for this edition is minimal at best compared to some other masterings. If you're happy with the version you have keep it and spent your money on something else (the \\"Immersion\\" set if you must have it).\\"Immersion\\" set if you must have it).
B005H5GEQM|5.0|Key points -watch what you buy - you need English subtitles throughout and I watched the shorter version - from other reviews the longer version 'wanders' and losses a strength of the shorter version - its focus on Senna and direct quotes from him or his family.  I found the shorter version wonderfully unfolded the story af Ayrton Senna life and carefully told/structured the way his life/career developed. Although I knew a fair bit about him I didn't reliaze the extent of his good work he untertook for his country and its people. His story on the track and his rivalry with Alain Prost was legend at the time and is pure theatre in retrospect. As someone else notes you get the sense he knew the equipment he was driving was quite likely to cause his death or serious injury - that weekend at Imola was a landmark for F1 and in credit to the sport they took on extensive changes after that race to ensure driver safety became a priority. His was the last death in F1 - 17+ years ago. It was not just Senna death but the extent of other crashs, death and injury at that meeting that changed F1 for the positive.  I highly recommend this film, its very well crafted and I am surpised I have not heard more of it. This man won 41 times in 161 starts, he held pole position 65 times and won the world championship 3 times. If you watch F1 try to see this film or at least watch the 1984 Monaco GP - Senna's win still sends chills up my spine - what a racer he was and this films tells us he left a legacy of honour, compassion and a credit to his Country. An estimated 3 million people turned out on the streets of Sao Pualo at his funeral.

I think Feist has one of the best voices in indy music today.<br /><br />[Update 1/2012]<br /><br />My original review was \\"gets better every listen\\".  Well, I've listened to it at least 50 or 60 times now and my opinion is that this album is as good as \\"The Reminder\\".  It's definitely a different feel but every song on this album is beautiful.  I think people have been too quick to dismiss it just because it's got a slightly different feel to it.

0307272702|5.0|Taubes' book is one of the most important books ever written on nutrition. There are thousands of books written on diet and obesity, and the overwhelming majority of them are deeply flawed at best. The so-called advice offered (and now even forcibly mandated by public and corporate powers) is also dead wrong, as will be most of those who trust said advice.  There are many thoughts on why this is the case, and many \\"conspiracy\\" theories as to how it came about, some with substantial evidence and outright smoking guns. This area of health is rife with disinformation, misinformation, ignorance, and outright lies.  Taubes does not deal with any of that directly. He does something quite different and important: he uses solid research from the hard literature to make his case in a very precise and focused way. The case he makes is airtight and irrefutable, even from the most hard-nosed skeptic's viewpoint.   The first thrust of this book is to show that the old \\"calories in - calories out\\" steam engine view of obesity is not only mildly incorrect, it is so very obviously wrong on so many levels as to completely defy rational thought. While he does not deal with the reasons behind this deadly myopia in the professional, corporate, and governmental world, he does systematically dismember this superstitious silliness with glorious logic and hard evidence.  From the misunderstanding of the application of thermodynamic \\"laws\\" in biological systems to the research on obesity and disease connections, he deftly leads the reader to a greater understanding of what the real research on obesity actually says, and what that means in terms of personal health and public policy.  His main concentration is on fat metabolism versus carbohydrate metabolism, and how carbs disturb the delicately balanced fat storage mechanism and cause obesity. He describes the research which backs this up, and has for decades and decades, while being totally ignored by most medical and public health officials. He discusses how long some of this research has shown these things and mentions how it has been consistently ignored.  That's right - carbs. Not dietary fat, not sloth, not moral weakness, not any other of the fad social mythology which passes for \\"evidence\\" driven policies and public stances. He details the increased understanding from more sensitive and better done research which essentially proves that our great-grandmothers had a better sense of healthy food than almost all the scientists, dieticians, health agency spokescritters, and gurus who have filled our heads with lies for at least 60 years. (And been accessories to the pain and death of millions of wrongly informed people, I hasten to add.)  His focus is completely on the science, and he does not venture into the politics or economic pressures which created this stupid state of affairs (the vitriol here is mine). While he does not discuss it directly, his book does point out the dangers of trusting science to give hard answers to questions of diet and health. As I point out in my review of Weston A.Price's \\"Nutrition and Physical Degeneration,\\" science will not be able to give us solid answers to dietary questions for at least another 1,000 years, at the snail's pace and myopic style of current research, some of which is clearly discussed in this book.  I do have some quibbles with him: his statement about being about to get adequate vitamin D from exposure to sunlight is over-simplified to the point of being incorrect. He also advises people to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugars, which is extremely bad advice, given the dangers inherent in most of them. He does not mention the impact of MSG on obesity (it causes obesity - MSG is reportedly used to fatten lab animals for obesity experiments).  He does not mention experiments on farm animals in the 1940s which showed that the diet which fattened mammals most quickly was one of grains and vegetable oil. He does not go into the differences in saturated fats, and how medium-chain fatty acids are handled differently in the body. He also does not mention that animal fat is a dense source of critical nutrients, and that saturated fat is crucial in triggering satiation, hence limiting appetite, cravings, and overeating.   Given all that, his work is still ironclad and irrefutable even in its narrow focus. Add in all the rest and you have a overwhelming body of evidence which is more than compelling enough to warrant a major investigation into the reasons why this information has been forcibly withheld from the public (causing untold suffering and death).  I gave it 5 stars, not because it is perfect, but because it is so powerful, so right, and so necessary.  Bottom line: everyone should read this book, period. The information here can literally save your life and that of those you love. Doctors, other medical people, dieticians, and others involved in the public sector dealing with nutrition should read this NOW, before they kill any more people through their ignorance.

B005J0VPNC|5.0|I'm gonna give it 5 stars, despite limitations. They can be overcome. No flash? No zoom? Need to take 5 photos to see and save 5 different effects? No widescreen? No front camera support?  No problem!   Just shoot all your photos with your regular camera, and THEN open up Paper Camera and try the different effects on your photo, save as many of them as you like. Then you have the original plus as many filtered images of the same shot as you want. I love it!
B0002DB52M|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing. If you are a fan of the works of Von Trier than it is an absolute must-buy! The performances are captivating, especially in the leads of Nicole Kidman (grace) and Paul Bettany (Tom Edison Jr.). The setting and stage reminds me of live theater and minimalistic qualities of Beckett and Brecht. The movie deals in the classic americana themes of class difference, power, desperation, lust, love, greed and frailty. Its so different then the most recent works of Von Trier, but in such a good way that it demands a watch. I could not recommend it any higher.
B005J0VPNC|1.0|This app is awesome and very cool....when it works.  Luckily I got it for free, else I woul dbe disappointed.  Force close almost 90% of the time and when it does work I only get 1-2 pictures before it crashes.  I have reinstalled a few times to no avail and Im on a Samsung Moment.....never had an issue with any other app.  When it works, the few times it has, it is awesome.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|By now I'm sure you all know the story behind Alter Bridge or else you wouldn't be on this page looking into their music.  So, rather then go into all that, I want to bring you my honest review of their album \\"Blackbird.\\"  I'll start my saying I actually do not own their first album so, in comparison to their debut, I have none.  1. Ties That Bind - A very killer, hard-hitting way bto begin this album.  Myles' vocals are a bit harder, yet mesh so well with the guitar work and the bass line.  The bass line is what I believe gives this track that rawness and hard feel it has.  A definit highlight to begin and get us all ready for what's to come.  5/5  2. Come To Life - Again, a very heavy intro right off the bat; the guitar work here is incredibly solid, and the drums come through with such power it makes you rock out instantly.  Myles lets his voice harmonize over the heaviness again, and what you get is pure emotion in a rock 'n roll way.  Amazing.  5/5  3. Brand New Start - This is a song I believe is a slight ode to Creed, and where Alter Bridge wants to go as their own band.  Also, meaningful to Myles and what he's going through and wants to change.  The vocals here are what do it.  Very strong, powerful, and hauntingly emtional.  5/5  4. Buried Alive - I'll admit, I wasn't crazy about this song when I first heard it and truthfully I don't know if I'm 100% behind it.  The guitars and drums are solid; but for me, something doesn't quite fit.  It seems to me, the chorus is actually a step ahead of where the guitars and bass are trying to go.  A strong track overall, but you may find it just a bit off.  4/5  5. Coming Home - Another solid tune here.  I absolutely love the guitars and how they just exhude a deep rawness.  Vocally, it seems haunting.  As a listener, you can tell there is a deep level of emotion being poured into this track.  Yet another strong effort.  4/5  6. Before Tomorrow Comes - A very, very strong tune here.  In the beginning you're made to feelthat this could be a ballad, however, what you get is a very heavy, uplifting and inspiring song.  Again, the powerful vocals of Myles Kennedy is what brings everything together here.  Amazing song.  4.5/5  7. Rise Today - Perhaps the second best known song off the album.  Following in the same vein as the previous track, this song is heavy, raw, and full of that positive message to rise up and overcome.  This is indeed one of my favorite songs off the album, and you can see why it's a single as well.  The guitars and drum work on this song will make your jaw drop.  5/5  8. Blackbird - I LOVE this song.  This is a song that has come to have such a deep meaning to me that I truly canno explain it.  Myles provides vocals that are haunting, yet so strong and emotional that yiou know he means what he says.  This is THE SONG off the album!  Everything harmonizes so well.  The heavy guitars, drums, and bass, combined with such a strong vocal performance, just makes you say \\"wow!\\"  A truly amazing piece of art here!  5/5  9. One By One - Off the heels of such a powerful track, you don't know what to expect from these guys.  What do you get?  A very heavy, solid track which again showcases the vocal talent of Myles Kennedy.  There is truly no shortage of energy and emotion on this song.  Another heavy, yet meaninbgful song.  5/5  10. Watch Over You - This is the ballad off the album, and it is amazing.  As I listen to this song I can honestly see that very real emotion is poured in.  There is a sort of dream-like serenity that falls over you as you listen and it is almost as if you're dragged into a story.  Trust me, just shut your eyes and watch where your mind takes you when you listen to this song.  Another amazing performance from Myles and the boys here.  5/5  11. Break Me Down - This to me is the weakest song off the album.  Not saying it's weak as it stands by itself, however, it just doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the album.  I have a hard time hearing whether it's supposed to be a slower song, harder song, straight rocker, or one with a message.  The drum work and guitar work are again solid, but overall I do find myself able to do without this song from time to time.  4/5  12. White Knuckles - For some reason I wasn't crazy about this song upon first listen, however this is one song that has grown on me and has become a definite favorite!  A very hard-hitting and heavy sound here, which meshes VERY well with the vocal range of Myles!  This song will get stuck in your head after a few listens, trust me.  4.5/5  13. Wayward One - If you have the copy I have, this is the final track.  At first, I again wasn't too crazy about this song.  Yet, the more I listened, the more haunting and mesmerizing I found it to be.  Another very strong vocal performance here, and the guitars by Tremonti really scream out.  Overall, a very strong way to go out, and really leaving us fans wanting more!  4.5/5  There you have it folks, my review of \\"Blackbird\\" in a nutshell.  A definite buy if your a fan of Alter Bridge, or even good musicianship in general.  Myles Kennedy has one of the best voices in the music industry today and should not be missed!
B0015DROBO|1.0|What a waste of paper and time. Just when you think it's going to pick up, it gets worse. Just when it can't get more dull, it does. My biggest regret is that while it was in my recycle bag, my friend asked to read it. I could not dissuade her, as she had fallen for the same bull that I had. Yes, bull was not my first choice of words, but I want this to be printed. Bottom line: Don't buy it. If you buy it, give up reading when you are first inclined to. If you own it, put it where others cannot borrow it.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Everything that Green Lantern did wrong X-Men: First Class did right. While the special effects in so many summer \\"blockbuster\\" type movies are eye-popping candy that are beautiful to look at (I'm looking at you Michael Bay!), if the actual story and characters don't intrigue you then the movie will just leave you flat. X-Men: First Class most definitely does NOT fall into this trap.  While the special effects here are every bit fantastic they are in support of the film, not its rasion d'etre. This film focuses on the origins of many of the characters featured in X-Men 1-3 while throwing a few new mutants into the mix. (While continuity is different from the comics, the X-Men films have kept their own continuity and nothing in X-Men: First Class is at odds with the rest of the films. In this day of constant reboots that is a nice treat.) The origin stories of Professor X and Magneto take center stage, but each character (Mystique and The Beast, for example) are given their due. Most importantly every character has an actual arc - we see the characters personalities grow and change which is what narratives are supposed to be about (i.e. the human condition). Yes, there are some really great battles and impressive \\"boss\\" fights, but the dramatic tension is mainly forwarded by character interaction.  This film does so much so well it is kind of like watching Munich and Revenge of the Sith mashed up into one movie. The drama and the effects are that good. Easily the best of the X-Films with X2: X-Men United being the former holder of that crown. (X-Men Origins: Wolverine being the absolute loser, natch.)
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I was so impressed with this app! I've applied it taking new pictures and to ones I took a while ago. Very fun and makes a great toy! Thank you!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Consistent and engaging, as always. One of the few writers in the genre to give this type of character a back story, though it took a while, (still not as long as it took Parker with Spenser).  The cold blooded-ness of the last couple of novels is a bit of a departure, however.  Is this a reflection of a post-9/11 shift in culture?
1423140591|5.0|Most definitely the best book by Rick Riordan yet! It was the worth the wait! I love the new characters Riordan added to be Percy's new friends, Frank and Hazel FTW! I received my pre-ordered copy on the 6th of October and finished it today! I love this book and I know it'll be torture to wait for the next book, but again it'll be worth the wait!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|The product arrived quickly and in great condition. The movie is a great slant on ET. Good way to escape from the current evening news rants.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I really enjoy this game!  The little noise he makes when he eats the candy cracks me up! Game play is simple, yet fun...
B003L77G2Y|5.0|have no complaints about this dvd.  It played and was delivered on time and well packaged.  The season is also good.  Has some episodes where it felt like watching a soap opera.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|As I write this there are already 87 one star reviews which already do a more than adequate job in detailing the shortcomings of this overrated movie.  I wrote this because I wanted to cast my one star vote in the hopes that it would give a more accurate evaluation to what I considered a substantially overrated movie.  I also note that in addition to the many one star reviews, there are many two star and three star reviews that also capture many of this movie's shortcomings  I found the movie dull, depressing and hard to watch. For me it was painful just wishing it would end quickly. Fortunately I wasted only $1.50 for a Red Box rental on this experience and did not actually buy it. I am a big Natalie Portman fan and she did a fine job with a simply awful script --but no amount of good acting by a single individual could make this a redemable movie given the awful script.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard is to be praised for the sanity she is able to retain after 18 years of living in hell. She is to be admired on every level.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have a HTC Evo 4G, which was not under the \\"Incompatible Devices\\" list; nonetheless, every time I attempt to open the app, I see a little hourglass appear, then the PopCap logo, and then suddenly the app crashes and I get back to my homescreen. Basically the app is unusable and I wasted $2 on this.   Did anybody else with an Evo 4G get this problem?
B0057A6GA6|5.0|If you like tower defense games, then you will like this game.  It is a little graphic for younger ones, but fun for the mature.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Like so many users, I was unable to do anything with the Zoom. I normally have the Kinect sitting on top of my 46\\" tv and it was unable to see the floor. I tried placing it below the tv and it was still unable to see the floor. I cannot confirm movement tracking because I was never able to get past calibration, despite wasting a full hour with different positions and lighting. I did manage to calibrate once and it seemed to be working, but within 10 seconds it again said it cannot see the floor and asked me to calibrate.  When I removed it from my Kinect, I noticed that the glossy finish was scratched where the edges of the Zoom had been. For this reason, I cannot recommend even trying out such a flawed product. Looking at all the reviews, the odds are against you in getting any use out of the Zoom but the damage it can do is permanent.
0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins has officially made it onto my \\"automatic pre-order author list\\" (so far, a list of one). I waited to post this review in order to tame down my gushiness but I don't think it's possible. I absolutely loved - LOVED - this book! It actually gave me stomach butterflies while reading it, no joke.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a companion novel to [[ASIN:0142419400 Anna and the French Kiss]], and it was fan-freaking-tastic to be with the characters Anna and St. Claire again. They show up quite often in Lola, and it's a definite treat for fans. Prior to reading this, I had heard some people say that they thought Lola was even better than Anna... but I just didn't think it could be possible. I'm still not sure I'd say it's better, but it is definitely just as good fantastic!<br /><br />I think my favorite thing about Perkins' writing is her characterization; her characters are all so realistically flawed. I loved the tall geekiness of Cricket, and the spunkiness of Lola and her obsession with costumes. I also loved how honestly Perkins depicted teenage life and alternate lifestyles (Lola has two dads for parents)... it is so refreshing to see this realism in YA. Most of all, I loved all the little moments between Lola and Cricket. I didn't think anyone could unseat Etienne St. Clair from his pedestal, but Cricket did... or at least forced him to share it!<br /><br />If you can't tell from my review, I HIGHLY recommend these books! In my opinion, they are the best of YA contemporary. I can't wait for my pre-ordered finished copy of Lola to arrive (releases 9/29/11) so I can read it again, and I'm already pining for the next companion novel, Isla and the Happily Ever After! Seriously, I would read anything Stephanie Perkins writes.<br /><br />Review from my book blog, A Book and a Latte (&lt;...>)
B005LLSLPE|5.0|SOA is probably my favorite show on TV right now, and it may be one of my top 10 favorites of all time. I was a little slow to embrace it. I wasn't interested in a show about a 1%er club and refused to watch it until the middle of last season when I caught an episode and I was hooked.  I went back and watched all prior episodes to catch up after the season ended, I then watched them again (and again). I love this show.  So, it is no small thing when I say that this just might be the best season yet.  The first episode was absolutely incredible, and the subsequent episodes have just built from there.  As usual, there are the new internal conflicts and external threats they have to deal with.  From where they are going 4 episodes in, I'd say we are likely to see at least 1 major character get killed off, and soon (the way it has been set up so far, there are 3 who are likely candidates for that fate, including one who if they go there, just wow!).  I kind of wish I had waited until mid-season to watch (as I did last season) so I could watch 2 or 3 episodes in a row and not have to wait and see how a story turns out, but there is no way I could have waited that long.  I am definitely riveted.    If you are a SOA fan and haven't started watching yet, I don't know how you've held out.  This season is incredible, start watching.  If you haven't seen the show yet, watch seasons 1-3 and get hooked, then start watching the current season.  It is an absolute adrenaline rush.
B00511ONPG|4.0|A fun, engaging read, this is not one of those \\"how to use Facebook, Twitter, etc.\\" books. Kerpen explores the keys to succesfully using social media for branding and customer loyalty building. The book is well organized, with specific action items listed after each chapter.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It is uncanny how well this predicts what you are writing. The few little quirky bugs are overlooked by the overall impression.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|The DVD does NOT do this movie justice.  When I displayed the Blu-ray on my television it took my breath away (haha).  In all seriousness though, the quality is amazing.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Does not download any video you want. Only the ones on the main page. it also runs all the time and sucks up memory.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, and the DVD version did not disappoint. I absolutely loved the inclusion of deleted scenes - some were very funny.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This is a great RPG for Android! Character growth and such was good.  The story line was a little corny, but it worked.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|Really not worth even the $1.99 I paid. One dimensional characters that are basically stolen from other movies. Gags that might support a scene stretched out for the duration of the movie. No characters that you care about. Random slo-mo scenes for no apparent reason. If you hired some high school kids from drama camp to write a movie, this is what they'd come up with.
B0058A119G|4.0|The instrumental group behind Barbra deserves high praise. Song choice was excellent, but Barbra's voice sounded hoarse at times. All in all still a worthwhile purchase.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|Product came in as advertised and works well.  My only complaints are 1. the HDMI cable is missing & 2. I couldn't find the button on the amazon website to complain about this missing HDMI cable.
1594744769|5.0|[[ASIN:1594744769 Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]] This was one of the most fascinating ideas for a book I have ever heard of... Writing a story around old bizarre snapshots gathered by collectors! I must say that the title and the cover grabbed me within seconds.. I was sold!! I won't spoil it for anyone, but do yourself a wonderful favour and read this book. I am really glad they left it open for a sequel.. HOPEFULLY MANY!!!!!
B000001ESF|4.0|I rediscovered this album after seeing it referenced in Ernest Cline's Ready Player One (an awesomely fun time romp to and fro 1980-2040).  Great Concept Album...  I think betters King Crimson and others in that era and in that respect it was quite a breakthrough given its relative popularity without a hit single.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game remind me of several other quality puzzle games, but better! Look out tetris! Beautiful smooth graphics, nice interface. Buy it.<br />Update: recently there have been a number of other games that have come out that imitate the gameplay  of this app. I guess that is to be expected.But truthfully Quell and Quell 2 are the best. I recommend these titles and say shy away from the imitators!<br />Enjoy.<br />Jb
B001EN71CW|5.0|What can I add that hasn't already been said..      I can't say how many times I have watched a FireFly episode or one of the movies.. They have a way of getting better after you see them a couple of times..     There is quite a bit of subtle humor that can slip by unless you are tuned in to the characters.  They are pretty funny in a sly way..  Jane cracks me up..    Other than the last BSG series there is nothing in Sci-Fi that is better.    Feb 2015..  Just watched the whole season again, Damn this is still a great show..  The humor is outstanding..    Look at all the reviews STILL being written about FireFly TODAY.. And it was over more than 10 years ago!!  This is a must see for any self respecting Syfy freak..
