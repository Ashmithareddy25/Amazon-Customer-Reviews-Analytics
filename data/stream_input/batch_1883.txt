B008JFC6F0|5.0|I thought I might be annoyed at the 60s-ish vibe, having lived through the 60s and late-era Beatles, and everything.  But, I'm not at all annoyed; it's really nice music.  I thought there might be more of a 2012 thing going on, who knows, rap, or whatever, but no.  And that's fine, because they really are in to what they are doing, and that comes through.  You don't feel like it's a put on, and for me, that's huge.  They are making music they like, and I like it too.  A win-win.
B004INNRFK|5.0|This is a great entertainment buy, live performances by so many talents, surprise duets and the late great Donna Summer!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Any book that makes me think about it when I can't be reading is a good book to me.  I loved her description and style of writing.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this for my 2 yr old son. I love this movie. The animation is great, and the songs are very catchy. Love the story, love the book, love Dr. Suess
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book grabs you and drags you into world war one.  It is a typical Follett with the charactors too true not believe that they are breathing still.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this pulp horror style show. This season is is freaky in a whole new way, taking place at a mental institution verses a haunted house from last season.
B000QXDED6|5.0|I bought this movie cause even the grandpas ar cut! I always wantto work out after seeing this! It's an awesome movie to kill time with.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable for my K2 began flaking, but since it was over 2 years old I had no warranty coverage :(  However, MabelinE in CS did everything in her power to get me a great deal on a new cable, and even sweetened the deal as a &#34;Christmas present&#34; from Amazon!!  MabelinE was polite, efficient, and represented the helpful attitude I have come to expect from Amazon CS.  The excellent service is one of the reasons I am a Kindle owner as opposed to any other E reader, I know help is just a chat away.  Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0035V35P8|5.0|There are no words for how much I love this movie! If I have one complaint it's that the couple in this vesion didn't get as much romance as the couple in the other version did.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|I like the Kindle Fire Sleeve very much. I can put my Kindle in this sleeve and not have to  worry about something happening to it.
B0074VTHKM|2.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book a nice light read. I do plan on reading the other books in this series later on.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|BluRay is so great.  Crisp picture and even better sound.  Can't wait for War of the Damned.  January 25 2013.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Excellent concert, excellent blue-ray quality that looked and sounded great on my system. If you are a fan of Sade this is a must have.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The app works great on my Kindle fire. I use it more so on my Iphone though. If you want it for your E-reader or tablet though, I would recommend it. I have had no problems using it on either.
1439130833|5.0|If your into the Secret this is a must have...great read and valuable reminders of how to change your life
B0041VXGRS|5.0|I love this book and it has gave me lots of ideas and different ways to fix the cake pops that my family eats up faster than I can make them. I have the E-book on my Kindle fire.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I bought this CD for one song, but the rest of the songs on it are just as good.  Love it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|We didn't see this show until the 3rd seasons started up. I borrowed my daughters first season dvd set and my husband and I sat down to watch it one weekend. We were hooked from the first show and finished the entire season within 2 days. I checked the store for season 2 and found that it was much cheaper on Amazon. So I ordered 1st and 2nd season. It arrived by the next weekend and again we sat watching a marathon of Walking Dead. I did have a problem with one of the disk in season 2. There was a couple of places that started jumping forward in a particular episode. At first I thought that it might be my Blue Ray player but my daughter borrowed it and said she had the same problem. Probably not Amazons fault. It had to come from factory like that.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It was far funnier than anticipated! Not just for kids, either. My husband and I enjoyed watching it with our daughter and her friends.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It's inventive and keeps my attention!  Fun to play!  The graphics are very good and the characters are very cute.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game brings back days of old. My wife plays for hours on her Kindle Fire she got for Christmas. She loves it!!
030758836X|3.0|Started out promising-- had a good twist midway-- then I felt like the author just got tired and couldn't figure our how to end it. Too bad-- it was fun reading for a good portion of the book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Because Angry Birds is just fun and for FREE!  What could possibly be better other than more angry Birds programs for free.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Have this on my desktop, laptop, cell phone and now kindle fire.  Dont want to be without it.  Use it all the time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|always a favorite when I waiting for something or someone  MobilityWare is awesome I love Kindle Fire and I play games often
B003O86FMW|1.0|Still haven't recieved and it could be because i didnt purchase this soo i dont like and hate haveing to come up with so much and many words to rate sometthing
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is one of my favorite games and I am delighted with my Kindle Fire MobilityWare is great I will use it often
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I kept hoping that something significant was going to happen in this story and kept reading. Having<br />traveled frequently in France I found the descriptions of France and French culture as stereotyping at its<br />worse. I guess this book could best be described as chic lit...not my bag.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This was a great movie and i really loved it i would watch it again in a heartbeat and the streaming quality is great.
B008XG1X18|5.0|absoloutely love pintrest!! Awesome way to organize your favorite web pages, way easier and better than bookmarking!! you find such awesome ideas! I found all my Christmas present ideas on here!! can express how handy and great this app is!!
0812993357|5.0|Grace Coddington is an original and she has a wonderful eye and lots to say. She has extensive experience in the fashion field both sides of the Atlantic, having started as a model in England and worked for English Vogue. Her accounts of  her marriages and long term relationship with a well known hairdresser, of working with various photographers as Creative Director at American Vogue and her relationship with Anna Wintour make fascinating reading. This is  a book about a life filled with fascinating people and devoted to work in magazines, making clothes look beautiful and interesting because of how they are presented.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I liked it! Well cast and family friendly 13 +. Watched it with my mom over the holidays, funny and meaningful.
0486295559|5.0|Not my favorite of her novels, and this heroine is a little on the pathetic side.  The writing is superb and she puts a person thru the paces of actually having to read English.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Neat graphics. Good fun. Keeps you looking to solve the game. I have played quite a few of these games and this one was one of the best. Keep up the good work.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I was concidering buying a sound machine for my bedroom so that I could fall asleep easier.  Well I did for $0.99!  My Kindle Fire HD, which I love, is now a great sound machine as well.  Easy install and Easy to use.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Vicarious revenge is very satisfying to watch - as one doesn't indulge in it in real life. An especially well-done guilty pleasure. Especially fun to watch \\"Emily's\\" careful, clever planning and quick improvising when necessary. Love long-term shows with character development over time-an actor's dream. Great writing.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|My Kindle Fire HD is now also my portable radio.  This app is cool and was easy to install and use and did I mention it's also free!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Love this show the best<br />Ever, bought it for m parents who have never watched this.<br />Definitely show times best.
B000SGRONM|3.0|Once I had purchased this for $8.99 on Kindle the price dropped to $3.99 so I am not completely satisfied.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie is one of my favorite country singers.  Have all her CDs.  This one is so far my favorite one.
B002QGSYRC|4.0|I knew very little about this war, which inspired me to read this book.  I wasn't sure if I had enough interest to read 650 pages on the subject, but Halberstam kept me engaged.  I  learned a lot about MacArthur, who is taken apart by the author.  The book also emphasizes the bigger picture of the war (not just descriptions of various battles) and how it set the stage for Vietnam and the rise of China and cold war tensions.  It's not necessarily a page turner, but it was interesting and educational.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Well it was kind of funny and it keeps you reading that's cool<br /><br />Annoying words of the book<br />But it is still good<br />My kid links it so I'll end it now
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I found the story intriguing and unexpected.  Can't wait until the batman and robin saga picks up from hrer. Super,
B002M9WW30|5.0|have been putting off buy them individually to get this boxed set. it was well worth it. Yo rock! ADRIAN!!!!!
B004EBT7RI|5.0|A gentle story combining both travel and food! Great descriptions of the kitchens and the families involved. The people in the story are well described and I felt as though I got to know them well.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|bought this cause it was way cheaper than any other hdmi available. it has been years since i bought this and it still works great!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Don't pick this book up if you have anything you need to do in the near future. It was impossible to put down. Colleen Hoover weaves poetry and prose around characters with such depth that you wouldn't be surprised to see them walk off the page.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|I got this movie as a gift for a friend, i sure hope she enjoys this movie. . . .
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I search TripAdvisor while planning a trip because the reviewers give helpful and practical advise for choosing the right hotel, activity etc. I have not been disappointed when I choose a service recommended by TripAdvisor.
B00321MGPG|5.0|Great series always a good watch to see how amazing the natural world is. reminds me to take a second and enjoy my surroundings.
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|The harmonies are great and I like the innovations made to the songs BUT they are so freakn short! A few of them are medleys so just as ur gettn into a song it quickly cuts into another... I know that it has to do with the plot of the film, but when ur just listening to the soundtrack it's a lil jarring and disappointing.  I guess that is testament to the fact that I liked the performances. Overall it is a fun disc. Recommended.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is my favorite batman. Ledger's joker is simply amazing, so dark and twisted. unfortunately, we lost a good actor in the process.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I chose this rating because, well actually my son got it first and he was enjoying it.  I started playing and I loved it as well.  I found another game that was fun and passed the time.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Enjoyed!!!,  about as good as first one!  Gave 5 stars, because of unfair ratings.  But really 4stars for the original & remake.
B008M36ER0|4.0|Slow at the beginning but it did improve. Mel Gibson keeps it moving. Not his best effort but certainly not his worst.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|I've heard from so many people over the years how great this movie is, what a tear-jearker. I enjoyed it, but it definitely didnt live up to all the hype.
B009HELT3C|3.0|Like most sequels this one has pretty much hashed and rehashed all there is to do on this subject. Move on.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Great movie, good acting.<br />I would recommend this movie to a friend.<br />I had some trouble with the movie freezing on the TV screen
B004WR125O|1.0|BEWARE - Onkyo Is Absolutely Clueless With Their Products<br /><br />WARNING ..... DO NOT EXPECT ACCURATE INFORMATION from Onkyo's own Web Site or their 24 / 7 Telephone Tech Support Staff.<br /><br />If you own the Onkyo HT-RC330 AV Receiver that was bundled with the Bose Acoustimass 6 System sold at Sam's Club, the Onkyo UWF-1 will not work with it. This is despite what the Onkyo online product sheet states (works with HT-RC3xx) and what Onkyo Telephone Tech Support staff might tell you.<br /><br />Onkyo USA's Web Link To The UWF-1 .....<br />[...]<br /><br />Read the very last line on the page under \\"Special Features\\"<br /><br />\\"Note: The UWF-1 is compatible only with Onkyo 2011 Network Receivers (TX-NRxx9, HT-RC3XX and Later), Network Stereo Receiver TX-8050 and does not connect directly with PCs.\\"<br /><br />I spoke with 2 different Onkyo USA Tech Support representatives (Orlando and Gabe) and exchanged emails with an Onkyo Tech Support representative in Germany (Kevin). All of them assured me that the UWF-1 would work with the HT-RC330 AV Receiver.<br /><br />I was told that the UWF-1 that I first received from Amazon was likely defective and \\"it can happen\\". After the replacement arrived and I had no success with it as well, I was given additional advice. I was told the UWF-1 won't work if your Wi-Fi's SSID isn't being broadcast (nothing is in the installation docs about this). I made this change to my Wi-Fi network - no difference. I then was told the UWF-1 doesn't work well with WEP security and that I should change it to WPA2. I made this change to my network - no difference.<br /><br />\\"Gabe\\" suggested that the two UWF-1's that I now had were both likely defective and that Best Buy also sold them. He recommended I go to Best Buy and try plugging them in to Onkyo Receiver's there to prove them defective before sending them back to Amazon. Instead of going to Best Buy (25 miles), Gabe suggested that an ABC Warehouse store was much closer and that they alsosold Onkyo products.<br /><br />I arrived at the nearby ABC Warehouse and told the salesman about my likely defective UWF-1's. He immediately asked if my receiver was \\"Network Ready\\" and where it came from. I explained it was the HT-RC330 that came with the Bose Acoustimass 6 System bundle sold at Sam's Club. \\"Network Ready?\\" - it's the first I'd heard that term. The ABC Warehouse salesman quickly stated it was very unlikely that the UWF-1 would work with my receiver. He stated that companies sometimes produce models with features stripped out to reach a \\"price point\\". I then tried the 2 wireless adapters with an HT-R791 receiver in the store. Both adapters were immediately recognized and worked properly.<br /><br />The Bottom line: The UWF-1 does not work with the HT-RC330. It may well work with the HT-RC360 and HT-RC370 models but Onkyo is too incompetent to understand the differences and communicate with potential consumers.<br /><br />Onkyo  =  Inept and Clueless<br /><br />Consumer BEWARE !
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I have bought previous apps from this maker. Lots of songs in this version, the well know and some not as well known.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Couldn't put this one down.  Best i've read in a while.  So many twists and turns to keep you turniing the pages
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A friend who reads a lot of the same kind of books I do recommended I get to know Jack Reacher...so I went to Amazon.com and looked up the books by Lee Child in order of when they were written and I selected the first book he wrote about Jack R. ...finding time to read it is the difficult part...I'm semi retired and have come across too much work in my landscape architectural business that I do from a home office....I can not hardly wait to buy the subsequent novels by Lee Child...his writing style never gets boring and he makes it exciting to read page after page...if I could give it more than 5 stars I  would...the author has an exiting way of telling a story and I love it...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great- even for us grandma's that are trying to keep up with our grand kids.  Can't beat the deal.  Would highly recommend this and joining prime.  Thanks Amazon.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Always great reading from John G.  hard to put down and as good a story as A Time to Kill...I recommend it...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids really like this app. It has some many great games for them to play. They especially like that they get point just for trying.
B00026WU64|5.0|The quality of sound is very good.<br />I like Bob Dylan.. some songs in this album I had not in CD.<br />Yes, I would recommend for everybody like something well produced.<br />Sorry, I'm a brazilian one and I have difficult write in you language without using Google, Babylon, etc.!<br />Ok! Thanks to all team of Amazon.<br />Carlos, Rio de Janeiro
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I LOVE this app, sounds great and plays great too. It is a must have in my book. I never have a problem with this gggrrrrreat app.
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|WAY BETTER ON VINYL THAN A CD OR PLAYING THROUGH YOUR COMPUTER. I absolutely recommend this to any Lana fan.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who's a batman fan! It's a great set!!! I will give it as a gift again!
1449415881|5.0|I was relieved and excited to be able to find one at such a late date.  This is a standard gift that I always send to a friend in Brussels.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Rob Pattinson has a great range of acting he always brings something extra!!!!<br />He would have made a great Fitzwilliam Darcy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I can't stop playing this game. There are a few games that needs  be removed because they don't work properly.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|Many songs on this dvd are unusual.  Not the Adele I like.  I wish I had purchased a different album of hers.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved it. Sometimes I wanted to smack Abby but at 19 u can't blame her. Can't wait for his side of the story!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm a sophomore and high school and everything and everyone just seemed so real and relatable. It was a great!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love this game!(: It's definitely worth the money . The story line is really good  and the graphics are so detailed
B00ARAO0WM|5.0|Feels like a lost hidden 90's film that never saw the light. Way fun! I enjoyed it very much !<br />Rent it. Don't buy it.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Nice discovery.  I was searching for another CD when I found this one.  They were new artists to me and I am enjoying it very much.  Will buy more of their music in the future.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|I love this movie, so it would get a 5 star even if it were in regular DVD format... heck, even VHS for that matter!
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I think Mr. Zafon is incredibly talented and always keeps me guessing. Would definitely recommend this book, but you should read the books in the order they were written to follow along
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This book has been compared to \\"The Little Prince\\" and \\"Candide\\", but I do not find either comparisons particularly fitting. The Alchemist lacked the heart and humor found in the aforementioned parables, and its simple narrative left something to be desired. As short as it was, I felt Coelho took more time than was necessary to arrive at his moral. I was mostly just counting the pages to the end. It was a nice story, if somewhat lacking as a work of literature, and I would be interested to read it in the original Portuguese.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found it to be boring and somewhat repetitive not nearly as enjoyable as the first book.  But at least I finished it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My household is divided between angry bird lovers and Star Wars lovers and this game just bought the best of both worlds together.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Enjoyed this and it did whet my appetite for book 3.  Some parts were a little too repetitive for my taste
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was hard to put it down.  This is a love story that kept me wanting to read more & more.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fun game to play.  I really enjoy it. It has become one of my favorites to play.<br />I wold recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire Game---Everyone loves solitaire.  How can you miss?  I love it!  Colors are vibrant and easy to see...Fun to play.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|It's o.k., however, as with Angry Birds Seasons, I'm not very accurate, therefore don't get the satisfaction of winning very often, if ever.
B008220D5K|1.0|Do not see this movie. it has 3 minutes of funny moments, and has all the anxiety of every possible bad element in life that you can possibly go through as an adult. I could not wait for the movie to end and felt extremely depressed afterwards. People with money problems, parental issues, and yelling at your spouse, kids, other kids, other parents, and kids yelling curse words at you does not a funny movie make. On a side note, if you need that extra push to off yourself, go see this movie. you will merrily go home put a shotgun barrel in your mouth and put your toe in the trigger well. So please dont see this movie.
B004SBX112|3.0|I find this game quite difficult, therefore frustrating to play.  I Guess my skills aren't quite up to par.  If there are tips for playing it, I haven't found or read them.
B00A2AU0KI|1.0|I still haven't received this video. I am very disappointed. Please credit my account. I wonder if I will order again.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like it a lot u should make one about ghost that would be great<br />I like at the end when he had the chicken pox awesome
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|The storyline is trash and takes excruciating hours to develop. Seems like every 5 minutes 2 people are outnumbered by enemies, find a crazy way to fight out of it, we get lulled into terrible, dragging dialogue, then 30 minutes later rinse and repeat. Lots of CGI, many scenes will leave you salivating over the stunning effects, but takes more than that to make a movie. Don't bother.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this novel. It was my first Colleen Hoover book and now I cannot wait to read her other ones! I highly recommend this book for any person out there because there is no way they will be disappointed! I'm sad I read the book so quickly (2 days) because the story Is now over! But it was amazing how Hoover can capture you from page one til the very last work. There was never a dull moment in the book and the characters were so fantastic that I felt like I've know them forever. The only thing I wish wasn't fictional is Dean Holder, talk about a great character.... Sky  and Holder fit perfectly and his mysterious ways capture you from the beginning! A VERY intriguing and great novel. Good job Hoover, good job!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Works well, it hold up to use and abuse. My wife has had one on another Fire for a year and it is perfect. No problems.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is so amazing that words can't describe it. The way it lures you into the circus. The way it makes your heart break and race. I recommend this book to those fascinated with breathtaking scenery and worlds.
B0098WZDZ8|5.0|I gave the album 5 stars because it's Rainbow and it's a great album, made even better with this deluxe edition.  But, the version of 16th Century Greensleeves is the same version used on disc 1, and that is very depressing.  It would have been nice to include Stargazer and A Light in The Black as bonus material.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This book was definitely everything that a person who has read matched will love. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book reached.
0810993139|4.0|I bought this for my daughter who loves this series. She is very pleased with the books and I will continue to order them.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|do not know why this does not work on my kindle<br />I am going to delete it this week<br />'
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I saw this movie on the plane during an overseas flight and it was good, so I bought the movie and watched it at home on the big screen and it was even better. And the amazon price plus free shipping made it even better
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I enjoyed listening to Breaking Dawn Part 2 the soundtrack because it had a nice mixture of artists that compliment each other. Shipping w fast, and no damage came to the case or CD.
B00065F86U|5.0|One of the reason I bought my D700 was to get that 8fps. For those who dont' know this, that's possible only through using either EN-EL4A battery(preferred) OR by using High power AA alkaline. Taking the EN-EL4A route would cost you extra. You would need<br /><br />1) This Nikon BL-3 battery chamber cover(costs around $35)<br />2) EN-EL4A battery(New ones cost around $110. You can buy used in eBay for lesser)<br />3) MH-21/MH-22 charger which can charge your EN-EL4A battery(New ones cost around $120, you can buy used in eBay for cheaper)<br /><br />You should consider your shooting style and other factors before deciding whether you would want to take the AA battery route or not.<br /><br />Anyway if you choose the EN-EL4A route, this piece works great. The EN-EL4A battery fits snugly inside you MB-D10 grip and with this setup you are ready to shoot for a longer period of time.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The border starts to break a little after a few weeks. The manufacturer should choose better material to ensure longevity.
B000067FP8|4.0|Not as good as the original, but still worth a watching. Better Special F/X and more monsters! The 90's pop culture references are even funnier now!
B00632HWOG|2.0|For whatever reason I can enter only the first six digits of my password.  Once in, it is fine for sending emails
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Really fun movie for families (might scare really young kids). As fun today as it was when I was a kid!!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Loved this movie and this cast.  Never get tired of Clint Eastwood.<br />Hope he makes many more movies and stars in them.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Captivating story truly romantic. The tantalizing tale of love makes you believe you are witnessing it first hand. Truly brilliant writing.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Little slow in the beginning but it was a good film.  Wasn't sure Batman<br />was going to step up to the plate, but in the end he made us proud!
B009P5S11G|5.0|The songs on this album are just great, easily the best cd I currently own. I especially how she keeps changing up and updating her music so that it doesn't ever really feel old.
B009SBSQOO|5.0|This is a fantastic sophomore effort from Pablo.  I mean, who can forget \\"Tanto?\\"  Great voice.  Great lyrics.  His music and voice just draws your soul.  Amazing.  Amazing. Amazing.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. I haven't had any kind of problems with this game. I did have it downloaded on my cell, it was fun but the screen was too small.  It's great that I can play it on my kindle now.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|This is third game from Dr Panda series my daughter played and she loves it (for a while) as any other previous games.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|A really fun puzzle game with simple yet tight mechanics. There isn't much of a story, but that doesn't really get in the way. The &quot;telepathy&quot; idea is really interesting, but seems like it could be expanded.
B00979OL5A|3.0|I played it long time ago on PC but now it does not impress me or my little one so it was uninstalled.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|This CD is great. There are a few short throw away songs, but the rest of the songs are so catchy and I really enjoy it.
B000031EGV|5.0|My nephews loved it.They hadn't seen it! unbelievable.<br />perfect presentation and packaging. Nobody ever regrets of watching this movie. ...
B007A4SDCG|5.0|this book is an eye opener, life changer. I read it twice and never have to read it again. Wonderful lessons.
0061906220|5.0|I purchased this book for my nephew.  Learn colors and how to handle adversity.  Great song to go with the book.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I like the cover, does protect the kindle, I would recommend it.  Good looking and useful, love the prioce, can't go wrong.
1608862801|5.0|I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it. I'm a fan of Adventure Time and liked it also. Great artwork.
0385535147|5.0|Best book of the year, keep you on the edge of your seat, couldn't put it down.  Make sure you don't have anything important to do before beginning this book.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|We really enjoyed the action and acting.  We were caught off guard at the end of the movie as the plot unfolded.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I joined Facebook primarily to keep up with a few friends and family.  I don't know half of the people you suggest -- coo many emails.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|The app requires registration with their service before it can be used.  I don't appreciate this, and immediately uninstalled the application.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a great way to pass the time in doctors' waiting rooms, etc.  So far, I have been able to progress  to the next steps.  Can't always figure out how to fill the whole grid.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Only watched about 5 minutes of movie.  Languange so ofensive that we turned off and requested refund from Amazon.  Very Disapointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|I get so into the game that every time I have to jump.. that I end up kicking my leg up and end up cracking up cause I did that!!!!!
B00993FEUK|5.0|This is a perfect movie for young and old.  Great addition to my collection, great for gift giving or for yourself!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|easy download! Appreciated how quickly I was able to put it on my kindle. Would recommend. Defintely worth downloading.  Kona
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Well I don't get the point of the game and it is boring I mean seriously! Someone tell me the point of the game!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|So I've played dragonvale for about a year and I have  to say it's one of my favorite apps. There is no real need to spend cash on this unless you just want to. And being able to breed different types of dragons makes the game enjoyable trying  to figure out all the combinations.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie. It is funny, colorful and has a lot of catchy music. It has the original story mixed with a new story. A lot of people are upset because it is a misrepresentation of a good book. But how does one make a full feature movie from such a short book? I don't know why people are so shocked over it. I also purchased the soundtrack for my daughter.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was really good. I like the diary of a wimpy kid series. I read all of them. I can't wait for another
B005LAIHZY|5.0|After seeing princess dresses and sets of Disney princesses including Merida, I expected this to be like most Disney princess movies. It was not but it was still a really cute movie. A lot of people complained about nudity and violence. I did not feel threatened at all at the idea of my 3 year old watching it. This is how movies are now. The nudity was to be found humorous, not sexual in any way so I don't see what the big deal was. As for the violence... Pocohantas, Mulan, Beauty & The Beast and other disney movies have just as much violence but I hear nobody complaining about that.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Fantastic book!! A Little rough in the beginning, but I absolutely loved it, and anybody who reads it will to!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is an awesome game. My brother and I built and awesome castle in creative mode and then with the mincraftinveditor app or something like that converted into survival.  Sadly when I tried to change my skin, it would work up to when I started playing it said I did not have permission :( I was able to get back on but without skin. Anyway that was a different app so minecraft had nothing to do with it, I hope. Most likely I will look for an article on updating my skin
B000HAB4KS|5.0|This has to be one on my all time favorite science fiction films.  It raises some interesting questions about the nature of reality and our relationship with technology.  This film has held up extremely well over the last decade.  To this day it keeps me on the edge of my seat, and I'm still blown away by it.  Simply outstanding!
B005HS4CUY|5.0|I chose this product because my husband and I believe this is one of the best animated movie series. We love blu ray and 3D movies. We have a 9 month old, and a baby coming on her way and we want to start building a movie collection for them.  I like the price for the  3 movies. This movies teaches important lessons for instance true friendship (Woody and Buzz); the values of helping, believing!!!
B000O19EWK|4.0|I haven't seen this in a decade, so when it came on sale I got it.  This was after seeing the new TASM, which I really liked.  I wanted to see how this film held up, and in my opinion it's held up very well and is still very entertaining.  An enjoyable film.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I use this frequently and then go to Itunes and purchase what I shazamed!!!  It has helped bring back old artists I had forgetten about.
1582701709|2.0|Ido think that mankind, as a whole, given hard work, ambition, integrity,and senseability, has the potential to accomplish great things. I also think that any man who thinks that he can do these wonderful things alone is very stupid without humility, prayer, kindness, compassion for others, and the grace of God, and His Son Jesus Christ. The Secret lies within our hearts and spirits.His name is Jesus!
B004EPZ084|5.0|Okay, I'm a very bawdy person and this is the funniest movie EVER.  If you don't like this movie, then you certainly do not have a sense of humor.  Oh, and I'm 60 years old!!!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Very good visual production.  Good characters and story line.  Message of values and family is storyline.  Fun movie, action, story and humor.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|loved this cd for christmas and made copies for families and friends.  it is a must for the holiday's.  enjoy
B00746O3X8|4.0|I received this carrier as a Christmas gift and, while I have not yet taken it out for a shoot, I have checked it out to see if it meets my needs. With one exception, it does. It is well made and sturdy. I shoot with a Canon 5D Mark II which is a pretty hefty piece of equipment. The carrier easily handles the weight and I feel that it can safely carry the camera. The safety strap which connects the carrier to the camera is a nice feature. You can get rid of your camera strap which is nice as I do not care for everyone to know that I have a $3,000 camera strapped around my neck.  On the flip side, let's face it: you are going to look like a cross between a camera geek and a SWAT Team member when wearing this. But having lugged a heavy camera around for hours, this carrier provides great relief. No more sore neck as it transfers the weight to your shoulders and back. You hardly know you are wearing it. The only major problem I have with this carrier is that you must use the attachment that screws on the bottom of your camera in order to hook it on the carrier. This means you must unscrew the carrier attachment and screw on your tripod connector if you shoot from a tripod. As I use a tripod extensively, this can be annoying. It would seem to be a very simple design problem for Opteka to solve. If anyone has come up with a homemade solution please let us know.  The connector problem is the only reason I gave this product 4 stars and not 5. Still, you can buy this carrier as you will be pleased.    UPDATE: January, 2013 I have now used this carrier extensively on a shoot to Key West and the Everglades. It worked very well and made a huge difference in my comfort level during long periods of toting my Canon. However, one consideration is that when hiking downhill or on stairs the camera is at an angle that makes it difficult to see where you are placing your feet. One solution is to use the second carrier hooked to your belt, but that presents a comfort problem of anotherkind. I did get some amusing looks from people seeing the unit, but many camera users were very interested in the functionality of the carrier. All in all I remain pleased with this product.    Update: March 1 2013 My initial review noted the problem of having to switch attachments when going from the holder to using a tripod. I have found a product that helps solve this problem: Metallic Base produced by Carry Speed camera strap series. I could not find a model number but the manufacturer's web site is [...]. I found the part at my local camera store. It takes a bit of manipulation, but you can now attach the Opteka slider that connects to the bottom of your camera to this piece and at the same time connect your tripod base plate to the carry Speed base. In order to get things to fit your camera may be a bit off-center but this is easily adjusted using your tripod controls. This fix is sturdy for both the harness and the tripod but I suggest you practice at home first as you will be manipulating the tripod a bit differently. I remain very pleased with this harness and will increase my rating to 4 1/2 stars (I would have given it 5 if Opteka had solved the attachment problem from the get go).
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Never heard Amy Winehouse and purchased this for hubby for xmas.  WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL.  I made copies for all my friends.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|Terrific music, interesting plot.  Wish the language had been editted -- I must have seen the &#34;airline version&#34; years ago because I didn't remember the liberal use of the f-bomb throughout the movie.  Well acted.
B007L96SI6|5.0|i LOVE HALEYS SINGING SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. i BOUGHT THIS cd AND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT IT PLAYED PERFECT..
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love the writing of this book, you really get a sense of being in the middle of the story. I couldn't put it down and purchase the 2nd book immediately after finishing the first.<br />This is a great book for fantasy lovers. Witches, Vampires and Demon's who could ask for anything more?
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Not what I expected the book dealt with a lot of serious issues and the main characters were believable but the story was intriguing and many of Sky/Hopes habits made more sense as the events unfolded. The chemistry was a bit far-fetched but overall enjoyable read.
B009X00E18|4.0|I'm liking this case -- it snaps on my Kindle 8.9 with a very firm click and protects all four corners from bumps and wear.  The short sides are left open for buttons and ports and the long sides are protected as well, with an access hole in the spine that allows charging when the cover is closed.<br /><br />When the cover is open and folded to stand, the camera is at the top.  The stand has only one position and the cover/tab fits into a slot on the back.  I liked that this slot provided a set space for the cover but I did not think the slot was as secure as it could have been since every time I picked up the Kindle, the cover stand would fall out.<br /><br />The cover overall is a very thin rubberized plastic material that will protect from bumps and fingerprints but probably will not protect much from a fall from a shelf or high counter.  The front cover is split into two parts that when folded becomes the stand.  It's a bit floppy on its own.  The back cover has a hard plastic frame that the Kindle snaps in to.  The frame has holes for the speakers and there is also an elastic band to hold the cover in place.<br /><br />Overall I like the cover.  It will protect from dirt and scratches and minor bumps.  It's unobtrusive in it's form and if you go for minimalist design, you should be pleased with this Kindle case.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|This book was okay.<br />I felt that it wasn't as in depth as I expected it to be.<br />For a book that I thought was an all time classic, it left me a little disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazon is my &#34;go to&#34; source to find television series episodes (streaming) after they have run on TV but before they are released to DVD.  I've never had any techical issues. They stream well and they aren't commmercial filled like from other sources.<br /><br />And of course...The Walking Dead series itself is fantastic.  Can't wait for the series to pick back up in Feb.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|A little bit of mystery in this novel!<br />While the book kept a good pace for most of the time, I felt that a couple of times that it was a bit of a struggle as it got somewhat boring, but then, it would pick up again and all would be well.<br />Still worth a read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|:):):):);):):):):):):)<br /> fun addictive I would recommend this game both of my kids love it. they are eleven and nine. wish you could earn more dozed dollars tho
B008BM9L72|1.0|I bought this purely because I wanted to see what the hype was all about.<br />There wasn't enough in the storyline for me.
0316010669|5.0|All of Gladwell's books are amazing! I could not put this book down. It makes you think differently about things!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fast action game that will appeal to both children and adults.  Very rewarding and a bit addictive!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better the second time than the first! I knew what was going to happen and still couldn't put it down
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A gripping story from a master craftsman, \\"11/22/63\\" does not surprise. It travels in the well-worn tracks of Mr. King's work: not necessarily a work of art, but certainly a strong effort of a practiced story-teller. I was expecting \\"harmonics\\" of Gunslinger books, but didn't present the ending I was expecting.<br /><br />Well worth the read!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I thought it would suck and be not worth seven dollars, but it is so much better than demo. my brow and I have full and my sis has demo and she cant multiplayer with us. my only complaints are that in survival you don't have anything to survive. I haven't seen creepers or anything. also, in creative, you don't get all of the supplies and you cant craft. it will jot let me use the crafting tables. so you are stuck with iron axes if you want diamond.<br /><br />despite my complaints, it is a good app and it is mostly worth the money (I would say that it would be better if the complaints are taken care of, and/ or the price was bumped down.)
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Our grandchildren use the Kendle to keep themselves occupied when they visit. My granddaughter hasn't  mastered the art of reading yet but really likes to play this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My sister got this app first and I asked her<br />&quot;What are you playing?&quot;<br />and &quot;Is it fun?&quot;<br />She answered those questions and I watched her play for a while then since it was free, I decided to get it myself. After that, I found myself playing this game everyday!! Even at 1:00 in the morning! This game is highly addictive!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!
B006O6F932|3.0|Not high quality product.<br />Playing needs extra care and parts didn't fit as expected.<br /><br />Not total disappointment but kids expected the playset functioning better.
B001414XLQ|4.0|Great album. Love the unique sound this band has.<br />I would recommend it. Amazon makes it easy to find music.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|It was a good action /adventure.  Plot is a little different than the original but the bad guys were some of the best and Nihty is becoming a staple character guy.  Good movie lots of fun, bangs and blowups.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|The latest Quentin Tarantino bloodfest combines Sergio Leone's \\"Man With No Name\\" films with some of 1975's \\"Mandingo\\" then stirs it all up with goodly doses of Mel Brooks \\"Blazing Saddles.\\" Somehow it all works.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx stars in the Clint Eastwood-like role as Django. But unlike Clint, Django is a slave, 2 years before the Civil War. The film opens \\"somewhere in Texas.\\" Django is freed by a bounty hunter and former dentist from Germany, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). They form a pact whereby Django will identify and help kill 3 brothers that will return a $7000 bounty. In return, Schultz will share the bounty, give him a horse and perhaps rescue Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from a rich plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).<br /><br />The pair have a couple pit stops along the way including one at a plantation owned by a Col. Sanders double named \\"Big Daddy\\" played for all its worth by Don Johnson. During this segment, there is a hilarious bit (partially seen in trailers) where Big Daddy & his KKKlansmen set out to kill our duo. They spend more time trying to figure out how to see out of the eye slits on the hoods than having a good plan of attack. Tarantino, a known film buff even includes Italian actor Franco Nero as a Mandingo owner whose fighter is killed by Candie's man. Nero starred in a 1966 western called \\"Django\\" (look it up).<br /><br />The real fun begins when Candie and Schultz play their verbal games. Candie is out of his league however. There is no one better than Waltz at delivering Tarantino's words and this film is no exception. He's really fun to watch and listen to. Django and Schultz almost pull off the purchase of a fighter, with the lovely Hildy being tossed in as a bonus. But Candie's old and ornery house slave (Samuel L. Jackson) smells something fishy and alerts him that he believes Hildy and Django are acquainted.<br /><br />\\"Django Unchained\\" has a great soundtrack, is very funny, profane and very, very violent complete with exaggerated gore and blood splattering. Also there is enough use of the then common racial epithet to fill up a dozen rap albums. The only scene that really bothered me was when Candie turns vicious dogs loose on an escaped slave. That was maybe a little too real but provides an honest history of the time and place. If you're a Tarantino fan you won't be disappointed. For others, be cautious.ne and very, very violent complete with exaggerated gore and blood splattering. Also there is enough use of the then common racial epithet to fill up a dozen rap albums.

B00AA7O22U|2.0|As a film, this movie was horrible.<br />However, that being said, if you are in the mood for a mindless, shooter and have an hour or so to waste on a popcorn flick, I would suggest it, otherwise the hour or so of your life.

B00APUYN0I|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie. It was so funny. Great movie. I love this movie. Actually watched it twice.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Nice storyline to keep you entertained!! Great hidden object scenes not to difficult but still challenging. Love the zoom feature and the level options you are given. It's very helpful to have a clue button and it reloads quickly. Also very much enjoyed the creepy ghostly element they added to the game! Can't wait for the next one. It's a must buy!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very good book that continues the characters at Hendly Associates created in earlier Tom Clancy books. Exciting and enlightening. Recommended.

0307352145|5.0|As an introvert, I found this book to be empowering.  The author goes deep into the study of introversion versus extroversion, without being judgmental of either trait, and helps us all understand this difference.  I can now feel confident and guilt-free when I just need a few moments alone to collect my thoughts, recharge my batteries, or construct a creative solution to a problem.  Others have always pressured me into extroverted behavior, and while I can sometimes play the part (as the book touches on), it nevertheless exhausts me and leaves me feeling like a phony.  No more!  This book is chalk full of empirical studies, interviews, and the author's journalistic observations of various people and settings, all which paint introversion as not only an acceptable trait, but a good one.  The author talks about how our culture has grown to value personality over character, and how in our recent past introversion was seen as a personality flaw.  She gives many examples to support her claims, and she always expresses respect and appreciation for both of the opposing traits.  We need both introverts and extroverts to make the world go 'round, but we quieter introverts don't tend to assert ourselves publicly.  It's nice to have an author like Ms. Cain do that for us.

B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I grew up playing the first RE game on Playstation and although I haven't kept up on the newer games(lost interest) I was blown away by the first RE movie and well they seem to just be getting worse from there. :(  I didn't have high hopes for this one but with every new RE movie release I want to believe in it so bad maybe that's just he nostalgia talking.  I bought my mom a blu ray player for xmas and received my $5 amazon instant video credit so this was a free rental and I was still horrified by the lack of quality this movie had to offer.  It felt like I was watching some college classes special effects project as the story was bad, the characters were not explained and the logic went out the window!  If I was 13 I would probably think this was an action packed movie but the action wasn't anything exciting and I don't know what the zombies were after the whole movie because there were no brains to be found here lol.  Now don't get me started on the horrible SD quality of amazon video yikes!
B00005JKGZ|1.0|Arrived on time and well packed. The picture is okay--a little grainy--but the sound is terrible. It sounds like it was recorded by holding a microphone in front of a TV, and it has a strange tinny sound. It is basically unusable. It's our Christmas tradition to watch this film so we ended up getting our old video player out of storage and watching a VHS tape of the movie instead.
034580404X|3.0|It's an okay story. I was mostly curious about the direction Christians character would go. It's definitely a years past, soccer mom kind of trashy read. Not impressed for all the fuss that it created.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The series is everything I expected and more. Can't wait for season 3 with Shirley MacLaine in a few episodes.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie! I never saw it at the theater but wish I had. It is definitely great for any age!

B0013TPVGK|5.0|Couldn't say enough about this book. The content of this book really hits home about the core of music and the core of life. Kind of like the &#34;peaceful warrior&#34; but with music as the center. And by the way all the things that are shared from the &#34;Master Teacher&#34; are all very insightful and appropriate to anyone who loves music or plays music.

B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I am a huge fan of Lee Child and especially the Jack Reacher novels.  I am a little disturbed that they made a movie from one of the books and cast Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. In the books Reacher is 6ft 5in and a big guy. Tom Cruise on a ladder wouldn't make it.  I think they should have cast a bigger guy in this role, someone a fan could relate to. But still love the books, probably won't go see the movie

B0050SYS5A|3.0|Lets you be 2-3 feet closer to the kinect, but you still need alot of room to use it.  So its pretty much a living room only kinda deal.  I'm still am glad I have it (it seems ok so far anyway).  But seeing how it doesn't help a ton, its not a super necessity, like I thought it would be.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I've now seen this movie a half a dozen times.  The only real recommendation that I have is to see it in 3D if possible as that adds even further to the movie.  Perfect combination of characters and actors to pull off a multi-character super movie!
B005S9EJ14|3.0|So last night I watched The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was kind of stupid and anticlimactic in a pretty large way (it just went nowhere) but it was fun and flew by despite the two hour running length (movies like this could easily edit to 90 minutes, but I honestly didn't feel it drag).<br /><br />The film centers on a group of senior citizens at a crucial turning point in their lives and they all pick up and move to India.  They don't know one another but all wind up living in the same hotel, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.  You have a woman who lost her savings after her husband died.  You have a gay man in pursuit of his long lost lover.  You have a couple financially strapped due to a wayward daughter.  You have a grandmother fed up with being used by her daughter.  You have an elderly man trying desperately to regain his youth through some tantric sex and you have an old racist in need of a new hip.  Together they make an eclectic bunch.  Upon their arrival to India all is not as they expected, especially the hotel, which is nearly in ruins.  The hotel manager, the young and exuberant Sonny, is in way over his head, but he is determined to make this work.  Some of the group immediately start to embrace their newfound surroundings, while others are dead set on hating it.<br /><br />Over the course of the next two hours, this group seeks for something (nothing we can really put our finger on) and then finds something else (again, I'm not sure what) and the end comes, which works out all right (because obviously when things were going bad they weren't at the end yet).<br /><br />My issues with The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel stem from lackluster writing.  Dench's voiceover is supposed to shed light on the group's progressive nature and yet it just feels empty and void of any real substance.  Like I said, there doesn't seem to be any resolve and even when the film draws to a close and they're talking about not finding what you were looking for but finding something better I was scratching my head wondering just what it was that they actually found.<br /><br />I mean, India was pretty.<br /><br />Still, this is a very easy film to watch and the entire cast shines in their respecative ways.  Dench turns out a true `Meryl Streep in a role Meryl Streep isn't trying to get Oscar nominated for' performance, you know, the roles that usually land Meryl a filler Oscar nomination anyways.  She's great here and I actually think it may be one of her finest performances ever since she lightens up and has some fun.  She's always so serious.  I'm glad that Nighy did not play Graham, the gay man, because it would have been far too obvious.  Thankfully, Tom Wilkinson gets it all sorts of right (more on that in a minute).<br /><br />I am stumped on something though.  Why is Maggie Smith getting singled out here?  Sure, she's funny, but like she's played this character in nearly every other movie she's been in.  Ha, I know that this is an argument that meets serious opposition by her devoted fans, and I am one of her fans so don't take that wrong, but Smith has fallen back on stuffy old English woman for quite some time now.  In her prime she was all sorts of marvelous (`California Suite' is one of the greatest showcases for her talent) but I'm talking about the past decade.  Still, she's been singled out and even received a SAG nomination and is considered in the running for an Oscar nomination for this.  Seriously?  I'm struggling to understand what it is that she does that is so special.  She plays a racist who has a change of heart and learns to walk again.  Problem is, it's a rather underwritten part and she doesn't have much to chew on other than a scene or two where she spouts a funny line.  Instead, I really wish that Tom Wilkinson were getting the awards attention.  The way he molds Graham with limited screen time and yet such backstory is sensational.  His confession scene with Denchis beautiful, and that hug is heartbreaking, and even though his lighthearted revelation comes off a bit underdeveloped (like, I'm not even sure he knows what he's getting at) he delivers it with such warmth and adds a beautiful layer to his character.<br /><br />I don't think I'd nominate him myself, since so far this year has been a bounty of supporting performances, but it is truly best in show and deserves to be noted as such.<br /><br />So, at the end of the day I have to say that I was pleased with the overall experience.  It is light and fun and has some emotional heft, but it lacks development and winds up being very forgettable because it essentially says absolutely nothing.is beautiful, and that hug is heartbreaking, and even though his lighthearted revelation comes off a bit underdeveloped (like, I'm not even sure he knows what he's getting at) he delivers it with such warmth and adds a beautiful layer to his character.<br /><br />I don't think I'd nominate him myself, since so far this year has been a bounty of supporting performances, but it is truly best in show and deserves to be noted as such.<br /><br />So, at the end of the day I have to say that I was pleased with the overall experience.

B000MPEIF6|5.0|I love this movie. Anyone into the whole zombie outbreak would too! Think about it, a lab comes up with a virus that makes people live after death... it's a curious twist on the zombie tale with a bit of revenge mixed in.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I also use Mobilityware's Freecell game. Both are the best I have found. As others have mentioned the fast tap is a time saver. If you like Spider Solitair, this is the one.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I like the normal uno better so I was a little disappointed all the add ons... What happened to the simple rules?
B0072OFM28|4.0|Even though the loss of Andy Whitfield is definitely felt throughout as the season goes on you think about it less and less. That's due In part to a great story arc and characters that distract you and pull you into their continuing fight to be free.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is facebook... What isn't to love? Games, keeping in contact with friends, statuses, pictures. It is a full fledged facebook in an app form.

B004DTXJ4S|5.0|I really wanted retribution but let's face it, I don't want to pay 15 for it. This one is really good though. I don't love it as much as the first one but it is definitely a close second.

B003N0XDT4|2.0|I could run the E7 through the USB port and it worked really well doing that but when I took it off the USB, it wouldn't run. The battery wouldn't charge and I really think the only explanation is that I got a dud. I don't really want another one considering the only reason I want one of these is for use with the computer, but I would turn off my computer and the E7 went dead, of course. Then when my computer turned back on, I had to put all the settings back (Bass Boost to +1, volume to 33ish, volume mem ON, etc.) and it was annoying. I don't want to deal with that. So I purchased an E10 and we'll see how that goes.    THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN PURCHASING FIIO PRODUCTS (From someone who used the E6, E7 and the E10)    1) The User's Manuals make no sense.    FiiO is based somewhere in...well..Not the USA. I can't really tell what language it is but if you think Chinglish is funny, you'll start crying when you read the manual. It's BAD.    In fact, the most frustrating part is that the parts that you understand the least and make the least sense on how they work are the areas of the manual where the language is most botched.    2) You will not understand the product 9 times out of 10.    You're going to get this thing, you're going to play with it, and it will take you a while to figure out what everything does and what the purpose is. So don't expect to pick this thing up and have it explain itself to you. If it's your first USB/DAC, and it probably is, you will probably be a bit confused. Also, even if you're switching over from another brand, it's a little more complicated.    3) Customer service is balls.    They're clearly in China or Malaysia or somewhere in East Asia. Their English is terrible and they don't even have a regular website ([...]<<<<----CANADA!).    So the FAQ are garbled and make almost no sense. The forums or Q/A from them is crap. And they pretty much straight up tell you to return the product to where you got it if it doesn't work. If theydon't do anything about it, FiiO will \\"talk to them\\" and you can send them your product but I highly doubt anything comes of it. Probably a waste of time.    4) There are basically no solutions in any forums anywhere for the product's problems.    My thoughts on why: Nobody else understands it and not that many people use them because it's a fairly new market to be a hobbbyist in the field of audio. Most people who are in this field have enough money to buy the stuff they want to connect their audio things together and clearly this is sort of a cusp in the market. Unfortunately for us, this means the product can be variable and we really can't complain.    FiiO gives a great midrange amplifier here. Personally, I'm mad I got a dud. The sound quality was pretty good. It was very analytical but smooth and nice to listen to. I'm sure they're great if they work.    However, if you can stay away from FiiO in any way, it's probably in your best interest. They're just not a wholesome company here in the States. It's clearly a company that runs overseas and doesn't put much effort into how they conduct business here in the US.

B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Stupid funny can be funny sometimes like I thought this might be. However it was just stupid-stupid. I watched it bc someone told me they weren't a Family Guy fan and found it funny. I'm not either but unfortunately it was more of the Family Guy type of &#34;humor&#34;. If you like the show you might like this movie.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|We had heard about Homeland from a family member, but had not seen it until we purchased the first season's dvd.  Once we started watching, we could not stop.  This is a fast moving, action packed thriller that looks at the political, psychological, familial and personal aspects of terrorissts and counter-terrorists.  We watched 2-3 episodes at a time.  This series is well written, fairly realistic, and the acting is superb.<br /><br />The characters are believable, but not predictable, and their behavior is impacted by the circumstances which they face. We cannot wait for the next season to begin.
B005DOKM9M|1.0|This Zip sleeve is too small for the Kindle Fire; sleeve will not zip.  I will have to return this product.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a great job.  I picked this book because it was inexpensive and I wanted to test my Christmas present.  It was riveting.  I read the whole thing in about six hours.  I was pleasantly surprised at the technical content that kept me checking the calculations.  The story unfolded in front of my eyes.  PLEASE READ THIS BOOK!
B004EI2NM2|5.0|Brilliant film, fascinating characters. It grabbed me from the start and wasn't able to peel my eyes away. Really well done, realistic love scenes, great chemistry.

B00APUQRPC|3.0|I love Clint...and Amy...and don't even hate Justin.  It was a good story, but predictable and cliche-ish...like I had seen it 100 times before.  Consider it mindless entertainment and just coast with it and you will be just fine.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|A blast from the past.  Same as back in the day, it's fun but nothing great.  Worth a play all the same.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Well basically its the only radio app you will ever need.  very very very very very very very very good.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Facebook is quickly accessed from the Kindle, but the version I get is very limiting.  It shows about 10 posts only.  if you check only a few times a day that limit is a problem.  Rather use my phone for facebook then this version
B000BISBDY|5.0|Good and courteus service, great product, great company and nice people to do business with, Sure would buy again if needed.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I love Google at work and on my laptop. Having on my Kindle Fire is just amazing.  I get faster response and thanks to the Kindle greater reading clarity.  I may never use my laptop again.
B004SBULWE|5.0|i constantly have problems with, &#34;not enough memory&#34; on my Android phone .  this app has proven to be just what i needed to free up memory.  now that i have my droid tablet, i don't have low memory problems, but it is always at work in the background freeing memory without me doing anything.  it pops up a little note at the bottom of the screen informing me that it has freed up some memory,  i like that!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|This set was perfect for my 5 year old who plays with them non stop. I love the horse theme.

B008M36EEI|5.0|More to this story than just fishing. even though I have always had a crush on Emily Blunt,(my wife keeps me grounded) She works very well with Ewan McGregor and I surrender.Very enjoyable movie I'll likely buy it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I bought this item for my uncle who wanted this item for Christmas so I am not able to say very much about the over product other than the fact that it works. As for the seller he sent these in a very timely manner even with the free/standard shipping I selected and would strongly suggest the seller for this reason alone.
B007G5K066|4.0|Great cast! I bought It ! You just don't know til the end,It'll keep you guessing it was that good
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Way better than the movie! Gives more detail and the star crossed lover routine comes more alive and is more believable in the book.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Although  a bit farfetched,as you would gather, The cast was great and worked, all of them. I've seen it twice
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book!!!<br />It has a great story line.<br />I can't wait for the movie to come out in a few months!
B004FK24ZA|4.0|I can't believe they try to get so much for this movie.  If the wife hadn't wanted it so bad I would have said forget it.
1577314808|5.0|This is the first book that I actually began reading a second time immediately after finishing the final word on the last page.  So far I've read it three times and then moved on to A New Earth and Stillness Speaks which are also very good.  I've since re-purchased this book five other times b/c I keep giving them away to friends.  This book was enlightening and also engaging to read as it has questions and answers interspersed throughout to keep it conversational and not just a one sided preach n' teach.  If you like this book, his others are equally good and so are his talks on eckharttolletv.com.  If you're interested in dropping the weight of the world, I suggest giving this book a read, and then a re-read, and then reading it again...b/c your mind has a tendency to make you forget that you are here, now.
B001P06GX4|1.0|The game I got was a generic game, with a different name from China, even had Chinese writing.  Not very pleased.

B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is the perfect app for face-to-face contact with family members when you don't live close. It is so streamlined and simple to use. I frequently pull this app up and let my 3 year old Skype with her grandparents who we no longer live close to. She gets a kick out of being able to see them, and it feels more personal than a phone call. In the 1+ year I have been using Skype mobile services, I have never had it crash, though it is slow to load at time. Overall, it's an amazing app that we use on almost a daily basis.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great for Bible reading. It not only  come  with just about any translation you could think of, but also has plenty  of reading  plans. The app is super easy to use and is great for highlighting or taking notes.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a great  read for the Christmas time.  A true classic that never gets old. One of my favorite books
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app simply does not work well.  It is jerky and not smooth.  You repeatedly see the first dozen or so posts.  You try to click on a link via the touch screen, it highlights the link but repeatedly takes you to the wrong page.  When you attempt to go back, it resets to the top.  This is aggravating if you are thirty posts down on your wall.  When I first got my kindle fire, I could use the browser to open the regular web version of facebook, but this version hijacked things, even when I type in [...].  It did this even before I officially loaded the app so I could write this review.  This is a trainwreck of an app.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've never left a review for a book before but I felt a need to do so with this one. I FREAKIN LOVE THIS BOOK!!!! There are no words to describe how amazing this book is. I saw the amount of amazing reviews it got but even still, I didn't imagine that I would love it so much. I honestly just want to jump into the book and steal Holder for myself. And I only wish I could be as strong as Sky. This book was worth so much more than I paid for it and it is definitely going to take one of the top spots in my favorite books list. I beyond live this book (it makes sense if you read it).

B0016OM3TU|5.0|Round Midnight! Just hearing the title conjures up a full moon on a starry night. Somewhere beyond the fields and seas lies a little street in Paris. People from around walk into a nightclub that will eventually change their lives forever.<br />Directed by Bertrand Tavernier, Round Midnight is the story of a man who becomes a legend due to his music that he shares out of his horn, and the life connected to it.<br /><br />I personally felt this film was so intimate and inspiring! More than that the film touches on many topics dealing with alcohol addiction, and the love that one gives another. One would say that the big theme in this film is about one man being the bruised and beaten saved by a savior. What is Jazz? What does it mean? In my opinion the film covers the true spirit of jazz by emotion, expression, and tribulation. The music is FABULOUS! Real musicians! Playing real JAZZ  during the film completely astounds me! Dexter Gordon plays probably the most Wonderful role than any other actor could do! It's all inexplicably well conceived and deserves to be remastered to blu ray! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR JAZZ LOVERS!!!!!

0380807343|5.0|The Short Version<br />Coraline is a dark children's tale about bravery, and while the movie was amazing, it still didn't do the book justice. This is a short read that I highly recommend everyone add to their TBR.<br /><br />The Details<br />Coraline is a children's horror story about a girl who, when her family moves to a new home, finds an old door that leads nowhere. When her parents leave her home alone one day, the door opens to a tunnel and takes her to her \\"other mother:\\" the beldam who wants to sew buttons in Coraline's eyes and won't leave her alone. In the end, Coraline has to face her fears and learn what it means to be brave--and cunning.<br /><br />Corlaine is easy to digest because it's so short--208 large-font print pages, and some of those are full-page illustrations. The simplistic tone mirrors a children's tale, which actually made it a little difficult for me to get into the book at first. However, the overly simplified and somewhat repetitive tone becomes a great contrast to the sharp and dark imagery Gaiman paints as the story progresses.<br /><br />Once I settled into the story, I couldn't stop. It picks up once we see the other mother for the first time, and I enjoyed how Coraline listened to her intuition as she learned about what was going on. She was smart, but imperfect, and I rooted for her the whole time.<br /><br />The dark imagery made me shudder at times and grimace at others. There are too many great moments to name, and I don't want to ruin anything in such a short book. But there were several moments when I smiled and had a jealous pang because a description was worded so vividly.<br /><br />Coraline is an adventure and lesson in bravery that left me breathless. This is a new favorite. I highly recommend you read it.
B001OL4TR4|5.0|Ladyhawke is a beautiful love story that shows an unbreakable bond between two people despite their situation.  It brought tears to my eyes.

B007PVHMCG|2.0|I had read all the reviews online talking about how small this was, but for my LEGO and Minecraft obsessed son, this was such a perfect merging of his worlds, how could we not want this? I spent weeks receiving alerts on my phone to get it at the correct price, and finally lucked in to a $34.99 priced set on the last day of shipping here on amazon before Christmas. You can imagine my surprise on December 24 at 6pm when this little box from amazon arrives. With only sons in my house, I am well-versed with the pricing of LEGOs and what the size of the box denotes. This box is about the same size as the sets that sell for $9.99, maybe $19.99. But $34.99?? Its a rip-off, parents, and I'm posting the picture of my son on Christmas morning so you can see how it fits in the palms of his hand. It. Is. TINY. I feel so, so sorry for all the parents that paid the $150/set that the marketplace on amazon was selling it for before Christmas. What a rip.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was a page turner. I couldn't put it down, because of this my family was mad at me. Gillian Fiynn is an amazing writer.
0547848412|2.0|I saw the movie and loved it and was anxious to read the book thinking that it would be educational. I was very upset to read all the blood and gore. It really turned me off.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I guess you could say glitchy, slow and doesn't always load everything. Freezes up a lot and sometimes just lists what's happening instead of showing facebook format... needs a lot of improvements.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book was very good!  I can't believe that this is so good.  I thought that this book was very descriptive and amazing I have read this book about 9 times!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I'm bored I can play this game for hours! It doesn't require stupid tasks its just using your brain to figure out patterns, my kind of game.

1601251505|3.0|This game was made by commitee in the playtests that unfolded surrounding the release of 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. It started with a really bold beta version that tackled the same big problems that 4e tried to solve in elegant ways that added a lot of flavor to the game--then, unfortunately, the grognards took over. What you get in the end is a game almost indistinguishable from 3.5 but with rules that are an even more nitpicky tangled morass.<br /><br />This is a roleplaying game designed to encourage only one style of play, the map and minis wargame.  Any flexibility or creative new ideas just got sucked right out. The art looks great, and the short stories at the beginnings of each chapter harken back to the glory days of the way the game was  the first few months after it's release. This game doesn't feel much like that anymore, and that's a real shame. I can understand that with as much as 4e changed the fabric of D&D that people just wanted to hold onto the game with an iron grip to make sure \\"their\\" version stayed the same as much as possible. I can understand the need to make Pathfinder more generic once it had to shoulder the entire 3.5 franchise, so people could use it to run their own, non-Pathfinder-setting games with it. It's just sad that so much good stuff got lost in the transition...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A fascinating book, once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  I loved the way he incorporated his personal life into the story of his Out of Body experience.
1601251831|3.0|This isn't new information. This is, for the most part, the 3.5 Monster Manual with a few renamings and some light re-invisioning of some of the creatures. The cover and page design are lovely, but the actual monster art ranges from pretty but uninspired to goshawful bad. For those familiar with the line of Adventure Paths and other Pathfinder books, much of the best art feels like it was yanked straight out of another book in the line. It's a shame since the cover art is so good--especially the Maralith (the snake lady with all the arms) and the troll--they look so great on the cover, then just get murdered inside. Really the old 3.5 Monster Manual looks a lot better.<br /><br />Other than art, there isn't much to say. It's mostly a pretty bland reprint of 3.5 stats with a few new guys (in case you really needed a Froghemoth in your games...), a few little blurbs of flavor text (which range from matter-of-fact bland to slightly interesting), and a organizational system of little round pips with different icons (like a little tenticle for aberration) that honestly get more confusing than helpful.<br /><br />This book was really what put the final nail into my interest in Pathfinder.
0345803507|2.0|I never even opened the book.  It and the other two are complete trash.  I gave them away but I really  should have burned them.  There are so many nicer things to read then this trash.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book can't wait for the next the next book to be released next year, great series by Rick Riordan
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just finished the book and all I can say is, WOW. It was a very good read, but the end did throw me a bit.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|As a preface: I have seen the Broadway version of this and it was breath-taking. I have both listened to these songs and also preformed some in my younger days and I love the music. I have yet to see the movie - I am rating this album solely on it's own merits.<br /><br />I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that said that this is more 'raw' then the Broadway version.  And I honestly think this is a good thing.  While there may be some purists out there that this dislike this quality to it, I think that it is a good thing that this sounds differently, as though it was being sung out in the streets as a part of life then on a staged set.<br /><br />In my opinion, from what I heard on this album, Hugh Jackman does a wonderful job.  You can hear pain, doubt, strength etc. in his singing and his voice is strong and full of life. After listening to what he sings on this album, it makes me want to go see the movie to see him actually preforming these songs.  Bring Him Home is a hard song to sing, it is high for a tenor and is full of emotion.  I definitely felt it listening to him sing it, and the Epilogue was heart rendering.<br /><br />The one major problem that I can hear is Russell Crowe.  He just sounds so uncertain preforming Javert's songs.  Listening to them, including Stars and Confrontation, I just longed to hear him sound strong, sure, resolute.  Instead he sounds conflicted, something that the black and white Javert shouldn't be feeling until the very end when he is consumed with doubt.  If one thing was going to pull this movie down, it would be his performance.  I heard he had difficulty with the part because he didn't understand Javert - who lived in a black and white world without any shades of gray until the end.  The Broadway performance that I saw had a Javert full of confidence and zeal for his job, no doubt, no regret, just a single minded focus on recapturing his prey.  That is really missing in these pieces and I dislike that they changed Confrontation.  It is meant to sound like an argument, them singing over each other, one louder then the other at times so we can catch the important parts.  That feeling of intensity is missing in this version.  Fortunately I have better versions to fall back on to listen to.<br /><br />I don't want to get to much into the other performances.  I will say Castle On A Cloud was never a favorite of mine until now. It is beautiful in this version and props to that young lady.  Anne Hathaway definitely puts emotion into her singing and is almost painful (in a good way) to listen to her in her sorrow.  Samantha Barks does a lovely version of On My Own.<br /><br />For those missing Can You Hear the People Sing, I will say it is included in the Epilogue which may be why they decided to not include the version sung earlier in the musical since it's a Highlight's album and not meant to contain all the songs. If you'd like to have a good version of all the songs I would recommend the 1987 Original Broadway Cast one. It is excellent.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I'm not the hugest fan of Sci-Fi, but I did love this TV series.  The acting was superb and if you're even a casual Sci-Fi fan, you'll love it.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This has always been a favorite of mine. I want to 're read the entire series. I love lemony snicker.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Well written and a good window into what was going on with the Rolling Stones throughout the decades (through Keith's point of view of course - I'm sure Mick has other thoughts on it.)  I enjoyed it.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I actually like the first Expendables than the second one. This has all the action stars from the 80s in the movie and you can't go wrong. A little campy, but a good time.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I've been reading this series since the beginning, and the quirky originality of Agent Pendergast as a character hooked me.  Recently though, Pendergast seemed to be settling into a somewhat less compelling life. Happily, I can report that this novel hooked me all over again.<br /><br />Perhaps I just needed to see Pendergast hit rock bottom and climb back up to make me a Pendergast believer again.  Whatever the reason, this is another well-written, creative, and quirky story from Preston & Child that will leave you exhausted from reading all night because you can't put it down.  Well done!<br /><br />*disclaimer*  Lincoln Child's father was my college chemistry teacher and fellow orchestra member.  The resemblance is uncanny, and I confess I picked up the first book in the series in a store simply because of the shock of recognition when I saw the authors' photos on the back jacket.  But even though Dr. Child was a great professor and bassoonist, I'm writing this review for no other reason than that I truly enjoy Lincoln Child's and Doug Preston's writing. :->
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It's so funny and adorable! Steve Carell is awesome in this and I really liked this movie.  I recommend to all.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I didn't buy this because what is the point if almost everything you buy electronic wise comes with the facebook ap so what's the point of this??
B008CLI3TE|5.0|We really wanted to see the episodes in order. . .seems HBO plays them ramdomly.  The HD was worth the extra cost
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because its not only easy to use but I love the scripture of day. I can read that a few times during the day so I can understand the meaning of it and maybe memorize it.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|They tried to add more characters from the game.  They didn't really make them integral to the plot, they just added them.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|I love search games like this one!! I bought just about all the games from Nevosoft and have enjoyed e er<br />every one. The games are chatty, though, and gotta do a lot of tapping but to me it's minor. A big problem for other players, though.

0810983915|5.0|I purchased for my 10 year old daughter for xmas and she loves all these books.  She has even sat on her bed and read some of the chapters to her little brother (7).  It makes me so happy for her to spend her nights reading instead of watching TV.  I will continue to buy these books in the future as she loves them so.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wow, what a great book! I was hooked from the very beginning. Stephen King, you are a master! I never thought i would cry reading a King book, but, all the words blurred at the end. BRAVO!!

B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works much better than other solitaire apps I have used. I would highly recommend this app for anyone.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|As adults we laughed, even without children.  Gone is the typical villain bringing an enjoyable look at a different kind of race to be the best while discovering the heart.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a great way to do something while you wait. I play it all the time on my kindle fire, never have had a problem.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is by far the best one I've owned. It's also the best headset I've used.<br /><br />I'm pretty hard on my equipment. I tend to go through headsets pretty quickly. One of the reasons for this is I sit in front of a computer for at least 16 hours a day, and when using a wired headset, the wire usually snags on something (keyboard, chair, or whatever) when I move or stand up, and this tends to destroy a headset fairly quickly.<br /><br />The G930 gives me the freedom to move around without the tether of a wire. It has a pretty good range - around 30 to 35 feet - and I can even go down into my basement without losing the connection.<br /><br />Even though this headset is solidly constructed and fairly heavy, it is very comfortable. Most of the time, I forget I'm wearing it, which makes conversations with others in the room a tad difficult as it completely encloses the ears, and muffles about 80% of the sounds in the room.<br /><br />The software that comes with the headset is pretty much install-and-forget. I've found no real reason to tweak anything. The only reason I've found for using the voice morphing to annoy my boss when we're chatting over Skype, but other than that, I rate this headset a solid 5 stars.
0670023329|4.0|This is an amazing story.  The book reads quite quickly but is not short on details.  He describes a sick system of '3 generaration punishment.'  Its aweful and his story needs to be heard.
6305781427|2.0|This one is not so great. Instead buy &#34;Yanni Live - The Concert Event&#34; in Blu Ray. I give full 5 stars to that. It is stunning and I have watched it many times over with guests and friends and still love it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got all three plus digital copy for 28 bucks! I told everyone on facebook and they all bought it. I think Amazon owes me a gift card for that. Lol
B00316DDUE|5.0|AMAZING! I just love this. This is the ABSOLUTE BEST Yanni has to offer. I have watched this several times over, with friends & guests and never tire of it. The player of every single instrument pretty much appears to be the best in the world. Fantastic lighting & effects. This DVD made many of my parties & the guests just did not want to leave.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie had great action and a story that kept me wondering what was gonna happen all the way through.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Can't go wrong with a foul mouthed teddy bear. It was good for a few laughs, storyline dragged at times but overall good movie.
0545157617|5.0|Timely and perfect!!! My kids love this book and my son always wants to here the stick story. Great product
0307730697|5.0|Simply...WOW.  This is the story of a true Navy warrior. I cannot recommend a book any higher than this one.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very Creative and Entertaining...I play this game all the time, takes a bit of patience but once you get the hang of it it's no problem.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Very poor movie, bad acting, bad plot, a real disappointment. Not something I would recommend to any of my friends.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was so good, it had a cute story line and good characters. I loved that it was short and a quick read but still a good story line.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is an excellent game that has wonderful puzzles. I enjoyed the challenge very much. I wouldnrecommend it to all my friends.
B00A757EFW|1.0|It seems like a nice enough game, but you only get through about one level in the lite version. It's a waste of time. It's just a trial version.
0345441184|3.0|This book came highly recommended to me and I'm sad to say I didn't like it very much.<br /><br />I was enjoying it until Gwenhwyfar came on the scene. As a 12-year-old (approximately) why is she so rude to Morgaine? Why is Morgaine so sensitive to her comments? The author's setup of their antagonism was just too obvious and illogical for me to enjoy. And why would Lancelet go from attraction to Morgaine to speaking of her dismissively to Gwenhwyfar? What's his motivation?<br /><br />When it came to religious beliefs, the dialog and self-talk were predictable because there were no shades of gray. Christians are either God-fearing wimps waiting to be punished or be rewarded if they are good enough, suffering from scruples all along the way, or they are arrogant chauvinists, sure they are right and all others are wrong. Pagans are full of reverence for the Goddess and disbelief or disgust that Christians could be so misguided, and Merlin the Druid is the voice of compassionate reason - can't we all just get along? I wish the characters had not been so black and white.<br /><br />At one point, we find Morgaine feeling as guilty as Gwenhwyfar for having lustful thoughts (and actions) with a certain someone, ashamed to return to Avalon and become a priestess again. But she decides to return as a servant. When she can't psychically call the barge to take her there, she decides it's because she has no right to call it, so she doesn't dare speak the word of power to summon it.  But she decides she has a right to sneak into Avalon. That doesn't make sense to me. But it explains how she gets lost for several years. While wandering on her way to getting good and lost, she regrets leaving her child with Morgause for the past three years. Why this sudden change of heart? I guess we're supposed to have more sympathy for her.<br /><br />Arthur, after about three scenes in which he reiterates his vow and intention to represent all the peoples of Britain, not just the Christians, suddenly caves in to Gwenhwyfar's whining that his heeding of heathens is probably why she can't have a baby and God will punish him if he doesn't carry her pretty banner with a cross. Why the sudden change of heart on the eve of the most important battle of his reign? It makes the story dramatic, but I'm becoming less and less willing to accept the plot turns.<br /><br />Gwenhwyfar is desperate to have a child, so against all her Christian beliefs (and logic), she decides to get a birth charm from Morgaine. Later, she's in the PERFECT POSITION to get pregnant (and probably fulfilling some readers' fantasies in the process) and what does she do? She throws the charm away! It makes no sense - unless you need to explain why she doesn't get pregnant or have a baby.<br /><br />Spoiler alert for this paragraph: Gwenhwyfar gets raped. I knew she would once I read her plan to go with no real protection to visit a man who had vowed to get revenge on her and her husband. What kind of woman would do that? A woman who is being manipulated for plot purposes, that's who. After her rape, Lancelet arrives and kills the rapist in front of Gwenhwyfar. Then she makes love to him. She justifies her infidelity to Arthur because \\"Arthur had not protected her from ravishment.\\" Hello! Neither did Lancelet, and he was your champion, Gwen! Then she rides away with Lancelet, \\"her head held high with joy and gladness\\". In this fantasy world, the cure for rape is a good .... Sigh. And this is feminist?<br /><br />I'm still reading the book. I'm guessing now I know the end story with Mordred and why he does what he does, which is logical, but I wish the story had more logic. I'm glad so many people have enjoyed this book, but if you find black-and-white characterizations and unjustified changes of heart irritating, read this book with caution. I recommend [[ASIN:0688003478 Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy]] instead.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Its good not great. Has almost every podcast you could ever want. Trouble is it only keeps streaming audio channels in your favorites forcing you to re search for your podcast each time. Plus it seems to loose connection much more than other streaming apps like Pandora. I give it 4 stars for the shear volume of audio it has available.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I had purchased (and lost) Boston's Greatest Hits and decided to purchase this original to replace.  It's even better than I remember from the album I had!  Love Boston, an awesome group, and this cd has most of their best songs.  I recommend it over the Greatest Hits.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I always think they can't get better....but then they do!  Season 3 is better than season 2 by far!  I can't wait for S4!
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The Racketeer is one of John Grisham's greatest book. It had me captivated from the first few chapters and as the plot unfolded I was unable to put the book down.  I was totally enthralled to the very end.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Cute and funny movie.  I enjoyed watching this with my teenage daughter and her friend.  I would recommend it for teenage girls.
0547884591|5.0|This is another great one in the 4-Hour series.  It actually may get you excited about cooking up some great dishes.  Plus, it is much more than cooking as it includes some &#34;meta-learning&#34; ideas that can translate to almost any other area of your life, like memory skills, shooting basketball and language learning.  Highly recommend!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|If I could give it a minus one or two stars, I would.  I tried to download the game for three days without success.  I was teased with this free game offer so that in frustration I would go ahead and pay for the paid version.  I never like to pay for something unless I know I will like it.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|the political agenda was a little obvious.  Again with the words,  Don't you people know the fewer the words the more concise the point made?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun, exciting and additive game.  You more you play the more you want and you are looking for similar games.
B0034G4P80|4.0|met expectations.  There were a few loose ends.  Destroying the access to earth doesn't allow Thor to go to earth anymore, right?
0316232955|5.0|This is the first book that has made me laugh out loud, cry and question myself all at the same time. Highly recommend this book!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Any movie with Charlize Theron in it has me from go.  Isn't Charlize beautiful?  Ok that was rhetorical.  Go Charlize!
B0063GORYU|5.0|A real Challenger!  I just have to try to win it just one more time.  Lots of fun and frustration.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Ximad jigsaws are the closest thing to a real jigsaw for an app.  I have been doing a puzzle everynight.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I upgraded from a Q9550 overclocked @ 3.4 GHz to this processor and I don't regret it. This CPU has overall sped my computer up a ton. My system was really being limited by my CPU and I can see that now.<br />PC Specs:<br />i5-3570K<br />GTX 570<br />120GB Mushkin SSD<br />1TB HD 7200RPM<br />ASROCK Z77 Extreme4 mobo<br />---Though most games were able to run max before I can now run max on this system with any game. For games that could before I see a lovely increase in FPS. Ex. In WoW I saw a overall 50% fps increase in cities which really helps.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Just went to see them in concert they sound as good in concert as they do on this cd.<br />I would recommend it
B006LRUVUA|5.0|No need to configure ports, security, or anything.  On a client PC, you don't even need them to fully install it!  Just run it, fix their problem, and move on!  It is a great utility and now I have a big enough device to use it so no matter where I am, I don't need to power on my laptop and find wifi.  With my LTE Kindle, I just connect, fix, and go about my day.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Kids loved it (2 and 4). Was funny. And I don't believe any scary scenes. Would recommend to others with little kids who need to sit still for a bit :)
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I am not a piano player but downloaded this app to mess around with and also for my daughter to play on.  The app is great and after toying with the controls I very quickly figured out all of the features it had.  My one gripe is that there is not a way to get the entire keyboard on the screen without making 3 layers of keys.  Other than that it is a great app.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|Too long to figure out, my daughter and I were playing on the game over one month and got too frustrated with it!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I downloaded the app and was up and going immediately. The functionality of the app on the Kindle was as good as it was on my laptop.
B009AY04A8|4.0|This game is similar to the other Nevosoft hidden object games. Each chapter has a lot of dialogue, then you find hidden objects, either by name or silhouette, and in some chapters you find matching pairs. There are 16 chapters, a zoom, and graphics are crisp and easy to see. . If you don't like reading dialogue, you can tap the screen to move it along. Each hidden object scene is timed, and you get time penalties for tapping too much. However, there is an option to disable the timer (it's called countdown mode) and once you do that, you can take as much time as you want and tap away without penalties.<br /><br />I've played the game through several times - it's a straightforward game, fun, easy to play, and the pirate story is actually good if you feel like reading all the dialogue.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|The HD app is great, however, you need some patience to use this because it frequently hangs up and you lose out on the timer
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an action packed thriller. I always loved the scene s when they were in the arena fighting each other to the death.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|HD weather.....can't get much better than this.  Current info, easy to use and all you weather buffs out there will love the info that is readily available to you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a good book but a little distributing about how realistic and detailed this author is about children killing children.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everyone told me to read but I never thought I'd enjoy it so much... finished it in 3 days... Wonderful book...
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Bought this for my wife and she really enjoys it. We have other Susan Boyle CDs and enjoy them as well
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Horrible story and play, very disappointed with Mark Wahlberg performance. You probably gotta be high to like this movie. Not recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job of developing an interesting yet horrifying storyline, adding twists and turns that make it hard to stop reading, as well as, making you fall in love with the characters and their simple desires for survival. A compelling, action-packed, subtle love story that makes you smile and be thankful for all you have, she delicately balances innocence and evil, love and war, in a way that appeals to boy or girl, man or woman. I highly recommend this book and can't wait to dive into the rest of the trilogy!
B002UKAL6G|5.0|Absolutely unmatched to this day.<br />Operation Mindcrime is, in my opinion, the best yet for this band.<br />It's intricacies of storytelling combined with the ever flowing music blend together to give a supreme performance of the rock-opera genre.<br />I have the cd, the cassette, & the DVD ;I love this album!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar has always been my all time favorite movie and I own it in Blue Ray, but to see it in 3D is exquisite.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|If you are a fan you will love this cd... The ballards are beautiful and the upbeat songs will make you want to dance.  Not sure where the reggae came from but they are good too.
B006H5120E|5.0|Very realistic movie and in 3D it is very impressive. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate are always phenomenal in their roles. Cameron has to be one of the best directors of all times.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|This is a must have if your gonna make different types of projects I started with bracelets now I'm making monkey fist and watches.
B009DKFST6|4.0|As always Pitbull has the good music and the energy. Would have liked to have heard ECHA PA'LLA on the Cd but it wasn't included
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch, the protoganist, is an older detective who does things the old-fashioned way, getting great case-solving results while irritating the political powers-that-be. A wonderful read if you can enjoy the investigation without needing steamy sex or a shorter book.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I was very satisfied with my purchase!! The headset works great and it was well packaged, so it definitely exceeded my expectations. :)
B000MRA6AK|5.0|Ahmad Jamal Trio: Live at the Pershing Lounge 19958<br /><br />This artist was beginning his career and his style and touch  was so very original and fresh; when he plays Poinciana he reaches a very unique style-repeating a sequence 15 times; his group is in synchronization and compliment each other beautifully; what comes across is the extreme harmony and the melody from each piece. I do not think he can surpass this album but if he does I want to hear it. This is high grade jazz by a wonderful trio. I love Bach, Beethoven and Mozart for classical music,but this artist qualifies  as special among jazz artists along with Brubeck. ed j mizrahi
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game itself is VERY fun but TONS of glitches. You should definetly buy this app but be prepared to lose ALOT of progress. ^.^
B000WMEAKC|4.0|This band, like many other pop bands, has a couple really famous songs that people really like, but aren't listened to as a band. Their singles are played but thats it. this is a great cd, however, and more people should listen to more than just &#34;apologize&#34;. if you like the singles you've heard, listen to the whole cd. you'll love it.
B0072OFM28|5.0|It was the completion a wonderful series. It well  deserved a five star review. The action and story plot is that of an epic adventure.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|first the movie menu stated $2.99 for hd and $1.99 for reg view. I selected hd but when movie started it played in reg mode plus the movie would freeze and I could not restart until I shut player down, this happened several times .I play netflix movies in hd and never had a problem. I do not think I should be charged for this movie! The movie was The Dark Knight Rises rented last night 12/27/2012
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I got this about 4 months ago and when I first got it I only messed around with game's and with it paired with my GTX 570 it was perfect match played anything maxed out still does, it overclock's to 4.8 ghz really easy and stay's cool with the H100 water cooler about 60-65 under full load.<br /><br />But with that said now I doing video editing and encoding and the 3570k still impresses when doing that.<br /><br />I'm sure that the 3770k is your best bet for video but the 3570k works great render time's are very fast. I am using programs like adobe after effects and adobe premier pro those 2 programs are very heavy take's allot out of a computer but I can run them no issues. I would tell anyone that was looking for a new CPU to get this one.<br /><br />I can render a 10 minute video with effects in 1080p @ 60 fps in about 15-20 minutes. That's fast!
B00A77II0U|4.0|This is the best app game I have played thus far. The story-line was engaging, it was not overly easy or too hard, and the graphics were excellent. The only reason I give it a four instead of five is because I wish it were longer--I completed the game in two days with just casual play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Quite fun if you want to relax for a few moments.  I've caught myself playing for<br />extended periods when I meant to play a game-or-two.<br />My warning to the undisciplined, if you have tasks that are time sensitive, complete them Before you decide to &quot;kill a few minutes&quot; playing Solitaire!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love this app. Can do puzzles anywhere now. Great time passer. Also has free puzzles you can download. And the puzzles you can pay for are cheap.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie. I really like the singing and dancing. It's fun but has some very good life relationship points. This movie is &#34;awka-awesome&#34;.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I only wish that I had purchased the Blu Ray copies to go with this so I didn't have to watch it on my Kindle Fire all the time.
B000BFNAYC|3.0|it does work albeit it is slow and messy but with lots of time, the sand will take paint off wood (wood fibers too!), paint off metal and cleans stains off concrete.<br />I initially struggled with adjusting the nozzle to pull the sand but once I got the nozzle at the right length, it really pulled sand out of the bag and into the water stream.<br />I was using the Karcher 1700psi electric pressure sprayer.<br /><br />The downside, i could not use a different nozzle (spray pattern)but what came with the blaster-basic hole, round pattern. i would anticipate this becoming bigger as sand wears away the inner nozzle.<br /><br />In comparison it is significantly cheaper than the outlay for a real compressor and necessary equipment and water does contain the dust but will splatter mud.<br /><br />A poor persons sand blaster for those occasional jobs (if you already have a Karcher pressure washer).<br /><br />If i was serious about sandblasting or had several items, (bring them to a headstone engraving company ), or I would rent the compressor, gun (may have to buy) and build my own cabinet for small jobs and use pellets or alternatives that is available to sand.
1907360212|5.0|I loved Little Women as a child, and I had to re-read it again as an adult after reading Louisa May Alcott's biography.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|As expected. The classic we all know very well. As per description, if you are a collector, definitely a worth while addition to your collection.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Read first two books....waited to read this after seeing a review that was not favorable....a mistake!  Real.  Do not wait!
0865479186|5.0|By someone who actually knows what he is talking about.<br /><br />Eye opening for me. I learned so many things from this book. If you are wasting money on buying pills and healthy food ... this is going to be the best investment you will make.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|If you love quick wit and smart thinking, you too will love this show.  Full of wonderful characters with crazy quirks and endearing qualities, The West Wing delivers. We can't get enough.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I really enjoyed Season 1 of Castle. It is great to go back and see the beginning. It is awesome!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have played this game many times on my laptop and wanted it on my kindle.  It is very addicting also!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I really loved Pitch Perfect, and if you dug the music in the movie, then of course you'll love the soundtrack. My only problem is that there aren't more songs. Or at least maybe extended versions of the songs. I'd pay for that.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like keeping my  mind engaged and having Solitaire on my kindle is handy. The graphics and colors are good.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|receiver loved the gift.  no complaints.<br />this review requires alot of words to submit.  no problems with this product, which was a gift.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|played on my 1st gen. fire.  with no problems. was a fun game to play. well worth the 2.99. love the g5 games!
B0052GACNM|5.0|receiver loved the gift.<br />This review requires too many words to submit.  No problems with this product.  Good music. no
B009POHHRG|5.0|I have to say this story had me at edge of my seat from the start! brilliant,amazing, very dark and twisted but leaves you thinking things in a different point of view. Long live batman and DC comics!!
B000HC2LI0|3.0|the series is great but the audio and video are not synched in this set collection and it is distracting
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Good read. Easy to follow. You feel for the characters.  Might look into some of his other books. The price was a little high
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was hard to put down. It bounces around a little in the beginning, but winds up drawing you in and keeping you in its trance till the very end. I recommend this to someone who wants an enjoyable, easy, but intoxicating read...
0618001905|4.0|Clearly writed and well informed on all historical events. Deeply explained from different point of view. Who suggested me this book was right.
B004A903AE|5.0|I read this book monthes and monthes ago and I feel like the people are real, like they are friends whose stories I am involved with - that is how vibrant the writing is. I will read everything she writes and first learned of the writer from a Gambian friend with whom I watched her &#34;Ted Talk&#34;. African history was hardly touched on when I went to school. I only knew of this war because my mother used to tell us to eat everything on our plates and be grateful because of the starving children of Biafra.<br /><br />This book is so well written and describes history that everyone should know without ever feeling like a textbook. That's why I think it should be used in schools. Great writing, great story-telling and great educational value.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|I'm not a fan of Seinfield and had no intention of ever watching this movie... However, my son really wanted it so of course we got it. I'd have to say I was pleasently surprised! It was a great family friendly movie, very cute!
B0060AY7A8|4.0|I needed more - if I write much more here it will be longer than the book. I am a Morrison junkie. The story felt incomplete.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game although it should be completely free that what's really make the game extremely entertaining
B003QSMC18|2.0|The movie trailer says, \\"I the spirit of the Disney classics,\\" but I would argue this Disney film is in a class all it's own--the strange. My kids we hunkered down under a blanket in fear during the Voodoo scenes more than they were happily enjoying our family movie night. This is one we will not be renting again.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|My summery of this book is a various amount of words and the reason I picked this book is because  I thought it looked like a good book and I would recommend it to Summer .....I thought it looked good I think its boring
B0084IG8TM|5.0|My daughter wanted it for Christmas.  She's watching it for the 2nd time already.  It will be three times tomorrow.  Good movie.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Justin beaver though up on stage this has nothing to do with the book but its the only way to tweet this I would recommend tiger beat to every one
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|this is a book that you won't want to put down.  you will think about it long after you have read it.  makes us grateful for our freedoms.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It  is a funny book it will make you  poop in your pants your mom will change your pants hahaha.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is one of those games that requires some strategy as well as being goofy and fun. What is it about? Think angry birds meets the blob. It's worth checking it out. Great way to pass time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Mark Owen was on the mission that killed bin Laden and this is his first had account of how events unfolded on the ground. This is 'soldier's-eye view' account without frills. As is well known, what can go wrong will go wrong. Owen describes he helicopter crash, running out of time, low on fuel, etc. A must read for anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of the mission.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I would give this game 4 stars, because it gets boring after a while. The objective is the same every level, but with slightly new challenges. Just like angry birds, it can be super addictive and fun, but after the first few worlds I find it gets slightly old. Very well made though.
B002SEW5WW|3.0|I bought this cd for one song only - Good Life, which is a wonderful song.  The rest of the cd I'm not crazy about.  I was a bit shocked with the rest of the songs since Good Life is so good.
B009OA57MI|4.0|I have played a few fighter games for android and this was by far the best. I did find it slightly boring after a while though because there are no new updates or features. Once you play it several times it becomes the same thing over and over and over again. Even with the mission editor it is still very repetitive. I do enjoy playing it when I have nothing else to do at the airport or other places. I say it's worth the buy, but don't expect it to be spectacular. The game itself works flawlessly on my galaxy SIII.
0061438294|4.0|Good book to understand people and how they allow body language to show you their thoughts.  Great for something like a Job interview.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A game I have played on my cell phone for quite some time.  Now I have it in a larger version on my Kindle Fire!
B009329Y30|2.0|Bad acting, basically all I can say. Efron has an expressionless face, and his acting is expressionless as well.  Boring.
0205632645|5.0|A must for all - no matter what you're writing.  I used the book during preparation for the CP exam.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This version has both the original black and white version and the colorized version. Watching the black and white is an annual event(s). Love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great game to play.  Mindless . . . . one needs that some time!  Great size on the Kindle Fire.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect since I'd only seen the previews.  The action was pretty non-stop and the premise was good enough to go with it for the entertainment value.  It's probably the most dialog I've heard from Jeremy Renner.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I asked for an itunes card so I can update my music library then I saw Amazon was having a 99 cent sale so I grabbed this album and Bob Marley Legend. I hope the 99 cent sale happens again.
B00633W614|4.0|I really enjoyed the Clifton Chronicles. Would recommend to anyone that likes mystery and history.<br />Jeffery Archer is always good.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Good music by an artist. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Bob Dylan style of music. Nicely done by Sixto.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is total action from beginning to end. It will keep you on your toes. You never know what is next.
0425263916|5.0|Could not put it down once I started reading it! I am looking forward to the next book to come out..
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the best Angry Birds yet. Excellent graphics. Very challenging for kids of all ages. My grandson simply declares it to be the best.
B00846REIS|5.0|This so far is a very good book! It is addicting, as soon as i finished the sample I had to have the full book!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you like army  war games you gato tray thes one i raid 100 star and plus is free you kand bit that lol
B00932A2MC|1.0|i want my money back...<br />movie was retarded, and then the streaming stopped so couldnt even finish watching it. lame
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Yes! A very well laid out game! I honestly couldn't put it down and purchased a few in-game downloads in the first hour of playtime. An absolute must for quick entertainment!
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book for my mom....which seems to be the rage of women in her age group and the condition couldn't have been more mint.  Delivery was on time.  Great order.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm on level 145 and I love it. I definetly recommend this game!! GameCircus LLC really did a good job on this game
B00632HWOG|4.0|A great, little tool for e-mail.  I like its portability and ease of use.  I would recommend this item to my friends.
B000PXUA5W|3.0|i felt it was very flimsy and breakable, hard to put links together especially for children.  5 seconds out of the box and one link was broken.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a game that you can play as a family.  It doesn't take a long time from start to finish and even young children enjoy playing this game.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like this app, it's like a mileage computer for my battery. Very accurate and highly recommended. Some say it doesn't work well with their Kindle Fire HD. I've experienced no problems whatsoever.
B008NABUU8|5.0|The best of the bridge building games so far. A definite must buy. Keep up the great work. Can't wait for version 2.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My neice stopped opening her christmas presents just so she and her Daddy  could play with this.  it was a huge hit
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Watched it, loved it. Amazing songs, amazing choreography, believable characters. I give it five stars. One of the best musicals ive seen
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This movie was amazing and funny from beginning to end.  Some might see it from a glance and think oh a family movie.  But this is exactly what every guy would want as a friend growing up is a TEDDY that says & does exactly what you are already thinking.  Soft at the end but true to life comparisons.
B000002URV|5.0|This CD gets me in the mood for romance.  The story of this group is very interesting and the music is so unusual and moving.  The beats are addictive.  Like a candle and have some romance!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The kids and I both love it! My 3 year olds eyes are glued to the TV the minute he hears the singing at the beginning. It is a fun story that comes with a moral that is great for a growing child. Would recommend!
B004YCKITI|5.0|Copycat is definitely one of my favorite films (other reviewers have put forth all its virtues).  I have watched it multiple times, but put off getting a Blu-ray copy because of Hi Def Digest's poor review of same.  Finally decided to get one since my standard DVD copy looks rather inferior on the Samsung 71&#34; digital set and I needed a &#34;Copycat&#34; fix !<br /><br />The BD copy looks great and I look forward to my next fix.  As usual, Amazon's price is good, too.
B00846REIS|3.0|Very similar to Fifty Shades, but couldn't put it down nonetheless. Guess I'm a sucker for these types of books.
B000EUDAWG|1.0|Piece of rubber came off tire and now it sits in one place. Called company and they don't want to know anything.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|The Tinkerbell series is one of my daughter's favorites. And, I really enjoy them too. Good story line, good graphics, good music. All around, what you would expect from Disney.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a really good book , I read it in one day , I'm not a reader .<br />Loved it
B005DOKIYG|5.0|The sleeve fits perfectly and is easy to take the Kindle in and out.  Took it on a trip and packed it in my carry on with no worries!<br />The perfect traveling package.
0143038419|5.0|I saw the movie and decided to get the book.  I at first got it from the library.  But after reading it I decided I needed it for my permanent library.  Definitely an inspiring book to ready again and again.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved the story, the writing, and knowing that there is more to come. Can't wait to read the next one.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|This port for android devices is brilliant. Worth every penny! I spent alot of time on dreamcast grinding on this game and now i am doing it all over again. Pick it up today!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I once read a quote that said that a great book is enjoyable but that a great book sets off a bomb inside of you. Hopeless set off 10 bombs inside of me , put me back together and proceeded to do it again. What an incredible book! When I read the last sentence I felt speechless and drained but in a VERY good way. I felt like I had no words to describe this books greatness and so I had to let it process in my mind for a while so that I can find the right words to express what I felt. I still haven't figured it out but i'm going to attempt it. This books drags ALL emotions out of your body and tosses them up in the air and lets it crash down on top of you at once. It forces you so into the story that you cant help but feel everything the characters are feeling regardless of the scene. Sky is the girl who is lost inside of her own head but you cant help but love her personality. She's smart and witty and sarcastic but most of all she is brave although I'm sure she didn't feel that way most of the time. Holder is...Holder is everything. He is beautiful and smart and emotional and fierce and loyal but, what I loved most about him was that when he loves, he throws himself entirely into it. He doesn't hold back. To see them together is to see something personal and real. Its overwhelming but in a completely GOOD way. What I loved most of this book was that regardless of their imperfections and faults and pasts and hopes, when they find each other , they are exactly what the other needed at that exact moment.<br />Beautiful, emotional book that should be read by everyone!
B005DOL0R0|4.0|The sleeve is very sturdy. I wish it were a little bigger, however, as I like to store my mobile hot spot in it which takes a little effort. It's very utilitarian looking - could be a little more stylish but maybe that's just girl talk.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I love this app because it is comprehensive in covering everything. I like to keep track of earthquakes and to have all the weather geomagnetic activity and earthquakes at once is awesome.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not since Easy by Tammara Webber have i so hopelessly loved a man in a book more. The words that Holder speaks are so few and so carefully chosen, its like poetry in a novel. You think you are reading a book about a funny girl and an intense boy and then it changes.... you never see it coming. I dont want to spoil it but  just trust me on this one..........I pinky swear.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was a gift for my brother and even after 2 years he is still watching it.  He said it was the best gift ever.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|I have a kindle fire, the app downloaded fine but I can't download music from this app. Soo frustrated, someone please help me :c
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|easy to play, lots of levels, board has a great look, and tip design makes it challenging. only change I would make is to have more themes.
B009P5S11G|1.0|Its boring and not her<br />she needs to take a break and relax<br />every year she comes out with a new album<br />like sweetie just take a 2 year break from music and enjoy life<br />shes trying to to hard and its quite annoying<br />so yeah
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Since Day 1 I was hooked, I'm ready for the movie.<br />I can't wait for more 50 shades books, Christian's story perhaps? !!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|None of my pictures are allowed to be posted without going through this app first! I look like a hot mess and this app helps me look half way decent. :3
1419705849|5.0|He got this as Christmas gift and he doesn't stop reading this!! He loves the story already and came on time, perfect gift for him. Thanks!!!
B006AZZPCM|2.0|It is good for looking up videos, but the downloading part stinks. You need to be carefully when downloading with it.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|well now i can use my kinect without running into my living room furniture. my living room's not that small but it feels like the kinect was designed for people with giant rooms devoted solely to game play. (man that would be nice). now i have no problems. pretty sweet.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I discovered this app when I was trying to steam my local radio station over my computer. You can listen via the website as well, however, I prefer the app experience way more. Its got a nice feature where you can shake your phone and also get related radio stations as well. Other than setting a few favorites, I havent tried out all the features. Ill be sure to respond back when I do
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Good game to work your brain but very difficult to get past each step. I would suggest starting from the first perplexus and working up to the more complex ones.
B007Y1ARLA|3.0|Not all I hoped it would be. I am a Keane fan, and it's not a horrible album. I have just heard better from this group.
B001PP9ALY|3.0|Action/adventure and then some.  Fanciful concept and impossible effects but the human motivations seem real enough.  This film celebrates questionable ethics but it is entertaining.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in years. I almost forgot the story. In it's day Tron was ahead of it's time for technology and advanced affects. I have not seen the new one but I will soon. Jeff Bridges best flick in my opinion. If you have not seen the original Tron, may I suggest and recommend it to all. No graphic or bad stuff, and the story is quite interesting.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I ordered this for a nephew for his Xmas present.  He loves this movie.  It arrived in perfect condition. Thanks!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Just a great little movie.  I was actually surprised by this movie when I saw it.  I'm not really sure why I rented it when it came out, but  I immediately bought it after viewing.  One of Hugh Grant's best movies.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|The best book ever I think it has<br />A lot of pages .maybe I should get more of these dictionarys
B008QMMEOE|5.0|toddlers enjoyed over holiday!! they helped one another and puzzle size was PERFECT!!!! kids were 2-3. no problems w/ the freezing screen. Kindle fire download.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|First let me say I read the whole series available as of Dec 2012, and I enjoyed it, but by the last couple books I was just reading to say I finished the series.<br /><br />What I liked: The Iron Druid Chronicles presents a new magic system and interesting interactions between fictional beings.  The way witches, vampires, werewolves and gods cohabit is one of the series strengths.  Kevin Hearne does a good job of introducing new characters that quickly pique your interest. Particularly the way he handles Thor really made me laugh.  You can see that Mr Hearne has really done his research when it comes to belief systems from around the world.  I also really like that he chose to write about geological areas he knows.  Clearly Arizona is familiar territory for Mr Hearne and the way he weaves in actual restaurants and bars makes the story feel more real.<br /><br />What I didn't like: My complaint with this series is the same for many series I've read.  The characters are just too perfect.  They lack the genuineness of real people. They rarely question themselves, they always seem to know just what to do next and their plans almost always work out the way they wanted.  When their plans don't work out its because the plan failing results in an even better consequence than was hoped for.  When I read fiction I like to imagine myself in the main character's situation, but when they main character is so unrealistic it's hard for me to continue suspending my disbelief and pretty soon the story just feels false and fake to me.<br /><br />All that said, I still recommend this book to those who like fantasy that's based in contemporary times but includes old magic.<br /><br />Lastly, the rest of the series is overpriced in my opinion.  $7/book is too much, $3-4/book would be more reasonable.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|Maybe I was so impressed because I am going through a life transition and this book gave me a lot to think about.  The beauty of the story is that it is told in the framework of a fantasy adventure and is therefore thought-provoking and entertaining. The story teaches life lessons as seen through the eyes of a young man.  This is a book I will read again and again.  Awesome!  Revealing!  Liberating! Inspirational!
B008LD09LS|1.0|Junk as far as I can see. I want to know when I bought this one I cannot remember buying it. its a pay as you go one, yuck

B009SJ3GUK|4.0|They topped themselves off with the creepyness this time.  Leaves you wondering what next years season will be like.  A lot more gore this time too.
B00003A9QI|5.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack.  A really good movie and the entire sound track is good.  Easy listening and very enjoyable.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I dont like this.  Pictures are the greatest and there isnt anything you can really do with this app.  If you could do more it might be worth it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is a must on all my handheld games.  This one is very nice and it keeps me occupied while waiting.
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|His acting is superb in this movie as usual.  All the characters make this fun to watch!  Amy Adams is great again
0525425578|5.0|I enjoy all of John Grisham's Books and the Boone series and very good, relaxing, fun books to read.  They are not just kids books.  They are for everyone.  Good reading.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this onto the Kindle Fire for my 7 year old grand daughter and she loves it.  She had to show me how to master it because I couldn't figure it out.
B0086700CM|5.0|What a great game!  This one keeps you going for a long time.  Tough, but a lot of fun.  Hopefully I will get as good as my kids!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this game onto my Kindle for me to play.  So far so good.  My 7 year old grand daughter enjoys playing it also.
0525423842|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's works.  The Theodore Boone books are simply easy and fun reading.  The stories are good and I give all of Grisham's works very high ratings.  Don't miss out on these little mysteries.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this game onto my Kindle for my 7 year old grand daughter.  It didn't take her long to figure out how to play and does quite well at it already.  She just told me she loves it.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|really good app its awesome that it tells u how long u can last doing multiple things like video,music or reading
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I read all three books of the Hunger Games series, and the movie was pretty good. It generally captured the bottom line of the books. There are definite parallels to the United States, the power of the Government, and the ridiculous entertainment mindset of most Americans. The violence isn't really gratuitous, and fits with the overall theme of the book. However, the subject matter contained in the book, but especially in the movie, is WAY too mature for most kids (even though that's who it's being marketed to). The violence and killing itself tends to become &#34;glorified&#34; in the movie setting, making the violence more palatable to younger viewers. But, even though the book and movie are about kids, it should not be considered appropriate for kids under the age of 16, since the emotional maturity to process the concept of &#34;putting yourself in the hero's shoes&#34; is very much problematic for the concrete thinking of kids younger than high school.
B009FKZ9AM|5.0|I thought their debut was decent, but this album knocks it out of the park! A must listen for anyone who loves indie rock :)
B009SQRL4U|3.0|This was a really cute Christmas movie--my daughter howled, and there was some funny parts even for me. Good, clean kids show!
B003BYYDXW|5.0|I purchased the CD for my daughters mp3 player we got her for Christmas, she loves Justin Bieber!!!!!! It's the less I can do since I can't afford he's concert.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|It Arrived on time, I receive my product in perfect conditions, it was very well packaged, with very good price,
B000VM9Z8K|1.0|Boring and predictable.  Found it difficult to finish!  Terrible theme and characters.  Was really expecting much more.  Wasted my time reading it.
1451627289|4.0|Purchased as a gift for my son-in-law. It was on his wish list. He is an avid reader and was happy to receive it.
B002413TY2|4.0|As an action movie it deserves 4 stars, the main actor is perfect in its role, the theme follows the prior two movies.
B0027MJU00|5.0|this is one of my favorite novels of Gillian Flynn. She is a great author that gets you involved in what you are reading.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The idea was good, however it was quite different form the original total recall which was much better. Action was good, the story too simple and linear.
B006LSZECO|5.0|this is one of my favorite novels of Gillian Flynn. She is a great author that gets you involved in what you are reading.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|As sience fiction movie the idea was very good. However the movie was too slow for more than 60% of it. Some action at the end which being at night you loose all details
B002ZG999U|5.0|It was a very good movie, lots of action. Just the kind of movie my husband loves. Very good gift.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Her voice is beautiful and it's a great cd. It's a very moving cd. Her voice is so clear. thanks
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Alot of action and my husband just loved it. I bought it for him for Christmas. Very good buy for him.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hard to go wrong with kindle purchases. I love the cost effective choices I was given. This was such a good book. I would recommend everyone read it and have their children read it. This series will stick with you for a long time.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|I bought my husband this movie for Christmas . It is his type of movie and he enjoyed it very much.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Hard to go wrong with kindle purchases. I love the cost effective choices I was given. This was such a good book. I would recommend everyone read it and have their children read it. This series will stick with you for a long time.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|This app looked promising at first but when I used the camera function within the app, I was upside down. I thought it was just me but seems other consumers whom wrote reviews were having the same issue.  I tried checking in the settings and locking/unlocking screen orientation but to no avail. Perhaps its a bug fix problem?  To the developers of this app, all of the features work just fine but please fix the problem with the camera...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just used the app on my Droid Razr Maxx and it works like a charm...easy to install and reading the book on this phone is actually NOT that bad after all.  I might put off buying a reader for now since this works fine and is readable.  The only real issue would be battery life with my phone versus a reader which is much longer but for reading the size of the screen isn't that much of a factor...great app!
B003YHSE7W|4.0|The disk arrived on time and worked great. The picture quality was very good with a little bit of grainy picture at times, this could also have been my TV settings. Great price, good movie what more could you want. Well I guess if it could load it's self that would not be a bad feature.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is great for my grand daughter. I have a white board on my fridge that she colors on and this should be a good replacement. The only improvement which would be a bonus is if some of the items made a sound... like the stencils of stars could make a twinkle sound?  But that would increase the file size I'm sure. Great job and Thank you!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My husband enjoys it. The perfect Whovian Christmas gift. It was nice to finally find one that both lit up and made noise
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Excellent product and great to have it on your phone. Highly Recommend it to everyone. You will not be disappointed. Definitely get it.
0071762345|5.0|I found Likeable Social Media to be a very good read and full of useful ideas.  Lots of concrete examples, both good and bad, to illustrate his points.  I'll be making use of Dave's advice as I move forward with my work.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Little boring at the beginning due to much detail of the recovering of the dead body from Boston harbour. Afterwards she recaptures her brilliant novel style of Carpetta novels.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome game . I play it all the time.  but I cant let my brother play cuz he will buy a bunch of stuff.  I love this game
141659521X|5.0|as usual Vince Flynn is terrific.  this book is sell binding  I couldn't put it down  Looking forward to the next book
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My girls love this movie.  I think they watched it 3 times straight when we first got it.  I like that there's not really a bad guy in the movie.  Tinker Bell always wanting things her way gets a little old for me, but a cute movie otherwise.
B00A89ITZG|4.0|If you have been training by adding more and more miles to your weekly runs and have reached a plateau, this is a great way to shake up your routine and start making progress again.
B0046W5E0Y|4.0|My 4-year-old loves all things Tinker Bell.  This one was a HUGE hit!  She will watch it over and over and over again.  Even my older girls (the oldest is 13) thoroughly enjoy it.  Cute movie.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I have been been mourning the demise of Rebus since he had been retired.<br />How ironic he has been brought back to life to stand in Another Mans Grave.<br />Great story descriptive narrative of the geography of Scotland. Loved it.. can't wait for the next installment. Rebus is one of those great characters like Harry Bosch just better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works perfectly.  Just what I needed for my kindle fire!  I don't need a calculator all the time, but this one is great when I do need it.  Very happy with it!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|We have seen this on TV and netfilx but even streaming HD is not as awesome as the blue ray directly connected to an HD tv. My wife and kids all like this series a lot so it was well worth the $25 done from $78 or something a year ago.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Fantastic. I read this in one day because I couldn't put it down! I would recommend this for anyone interested in a good read that you can feel connected to.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Easy to handle and colorful.  Shows theKindlefire off very well.  Keeps the Kindle clean and easy to hold. I love it.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I was worried that this game would take up to much room on my kindle so I deleted it.  I am sure that my grandson would have love it.
076781326X|4.0|For memories of the past, in my younger days, Thank you very much for reminding me of my days gone by.
0811729117|4.0|An amazing look at what occured on the Russian Front of WWII, fromt he perspective of a German Officer,great read
B008XBCJ34|5.0|We enjoyed this movie when it first came out; but the visual effects in 3D are highlighted so much better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|started getting ads and pop ups though which i am not to happy about! Hope they back off those or i might delete.
B005LAII12|4.0|Gave and received as a gift, haven't had time to watch it yet. Hope it is as funny as the previews!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This is a really fun movie. The whole family loved it, we saw it at the theater and decided to buy it.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|If you haven't experienced this movie yet you really really must. It's an epic sweeping tale with such beautifully crafted music to accompany it. This soundtrack is a very good buy.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My personal opinion... I think I like the movie because it humanized the characters, it shows you their weak and human side. Not to mention that the entire plot is very fun with some great twists.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|It protects my kindle fire hardware, but I wish the cover the screen was a bit heavier for more protection.  Otherwise, I would have given case cover a five.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I guess because I love this album most Opeth \\"fans\\" (the ones whom I had to listen to say \\"play some metal\\" at 2 of their shows in the past year...really annoying you were and should've expected them to play most material from Heritage..why bother to go?); and so you will probably consider me not a \\"true\\" fan, especially after realizing how many ridiculously negative reviews there are. I REALLY just don't understand why the \\"fans\\" find this album to be insulting or a disappointment? I guess if heavy guitar riffs and the death growl's from Mikael is what you were expecting; I guess I can understand it a little bit and yes Heritage is very different from the rest of their discography, however there are a lot of elements in this album that have been in Opeth's sound since the beginning. I'm a newer fan of Opeth (discovering them a couple of years ago, 1 year prior to the release of Heritage) and I was already getting familiar with their work previous to Heritage and maybe that is an advantage because I didn't get that chance to allow the death metal element to really soak in over a period of several years, which is why I didn't have that \\"expectation\\" for them to put out another typical sounding Opeth record. I accepted the brilliance of this album for what it is not what I was expecting. I listen to so many different types of rock/metal and no matter how long I've followed the careers of bands; I never and I'm not sure anybody should get their expectation so high of what they think they're going to get out of a band's next album, especially from bands who have a lot of progressive/experimental elements and as in the case with Opeth and their latest album Heritage the \\"fans\\" who were so disappointed to the point that they were almost left feeling physically ill...you were the ones who had those high expectations & because they weren't even close to being met, just completely disregarded this album as absolute crap and that to me is just absolute nonsense because most of you probably aren't open minded enough or haven't diversified your music listening experiences and basically tend to listen to 1 or 2 types of rock/metal styles, which maybe the reason you have a difficult time appreciating this great piece of music or don't have the patience for it to grow on you. Sometimes bands have to really change things up or try different things, mostly for the bands member's own creativity and a desire to push themselves into different directions they don't do it to alienate their fans (at least not on purpose). I think the fans who have a true passion for music will try just about anything or a passion for a particular band can appreciate at a certain level what their trying to do, even if you don't care for a particular piece of work. Maybe it's just me, but I love it when bands, especially my favorite ones like Opeth or Mastodon are always experimenting with their sound and always keeping things fresh and interesting instead of keep turning out the same album over and over, which tends to get boring. Creating an album like Heritage that is so different from their previous work, yet still contains many elements (ok no growling vocals or layered guitars) that made us fall in love with their music and to me that is just solid proof that this is what defines Opeth as a great band and not just another really good band. I believe Heritage will probably be the most underrated and maybe the most unappreciated album Opeth will ever make. I've always been curious or drawn to a bands more underrated album because (maybe it's me) I've always found them to be very enjoyable and a great listening experience despite what the 'longtime', 'real' fans claim to be absolute crap. Opeth has never and probably will never creat a bad album..I don't think it's even possible!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|It's a really fun game.  The graphics are surprisingly good.  It offers a lot of game play for the money.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's like command and conquer. There is the option to buy things with gold stars,  enrich if you run out you will have to buy more with real money, but they're not necessary to play the game. You can still do everything in the game without them :D
0525953728|5.0|Finally, I think the real story is told. I certainly believe this man far more than some desk jockey, freeloading, politician that constantly runs for re-election by buying votes with federal &#34;giveaways&#34;! Our military folks are the real heroes in this country that serve and sacrifice. Maybe after 20 years of service, if he survives real life threating dangers, he can retire and draw 50% of his base pay whereas a senator after &#34;ONE&#34; term can retire and draw 100%. SEAL training and real military missions vs standing on the town square and giving away taxpayer money. Who is the &#34;protector&#34; of this country??
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works good, looks good.....just like it should. All apps should be this be this efficient. Easy to figure percentages. Get it.
B00633W614|4.0|I like all of Jeffery Archer's books that I have read.  In this trilogy, I liked the first book the best.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|This is a very fun game. I like how you can unlock other blades and other backgrounds. I am glad there are 3 different game modes too.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I wanted to be able to look at facebook when I was away from my home computer and this is so much easier to see than my phone.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie!  Funny loved all the singing.  I keep humming the songs .  My husband even liked it.  I recommend it for a movie night for the girls
B000025JJ4|4.0|One of the &#34;Return of Blackmore&#34; discs this '93 was a happy choice after having walked away for a time. The Machine Head lineup will always be a favorite. A couple of the tracks get same old-same old but only a couple. The title track and Time To Kill really took me back to the days of bongs and light organs. Ian Gillan's voice has held up well on this album and the Glover/Lord/Paice bottom line is full and booming(you gotta love a guy who plays a Hammond organ through a Marshall stack). Deep Purple is another band that will tour til the wheels come off and although this disc is now almost 20 years old they're still pushing the right buttons. Definitely add it to collection.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Been listening to T.I. for many years. His last album made him sound broken and beat down. But he truly is back in this album. Very T.I. and very worth buying.
B000VWSINI|5.0|LOVE EMINEM, LOVE THIS ALBUM, FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY. The best part is that grandmas to those in England love him...and this album is no exception. Well worth it.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Always a favorite in our house.  Great imaginative characters and story, one that is watched often by my 3 daughters.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I exoected this movie to be better.  The dancing was amazing, and the funny parts were funny, but the &#34;dark&#34; parts were the jaring notes for me.  I would have liked more funny parts.  I think they really missed an opportunity to do a comedy instead of a &#34;gritty&#34; movie.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Classic Disney.  Family favorite in my house, not an overly long movie which is good for short attention spans.  Some dark imagery, as the evil queen turns into the old hag.  Recommended for any Disney movie enthusiast, it's a must have in your collection.
B0071BY1CO|5.0|This is one of the best 3D titles ever made. The use of 3D in this movie is the standard that all others should learn from and follow. Thankfully this isn't hyperbole as bluraydotcom certainly agrees with.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this new Mitch Rapp book with Mitch back in the present.  If you are a Flynn Fan or not this is a very well written book with great drama.
B005H29GSI|5.0|The game is simple; draw a card, build the tower, knock it down with the allowable number of birds. This series of games had been such a great way for the kids to get off consoles and do some co-operative real life play.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thoroughly recommend The Martian as a must add for your reading list.  The novel explores the epic struggles of Mark Watney, a near-future explorer, to survive his accidental stranding on Mars.  What I enjoyed most about this book was the humour and resilience of the protagonist, and the way he applies his intellect and creativity to solving the many intractable problems that beset him.  There is a fine attention to detail and scientifically plausible and realistic details (as far as I can tell) in the writing.
0316227706|5.0|This is a super fun coffee table book that seems never to be on the table as everyone who comes over can't keep their hands off of it!  The underwater photos are simply fantastic...and it's very clear that the dogs themselves are having a great time. Bared teeth, big eyes, grins....you name it, this book has it! At the end of the book are photos of what the dogs look like out of water so it's fun to flip back and forth to see how they completely change in the water.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|A must have! Better than than the last one. Love the twist. If you haven't seen this yet.... Rent it, you won't regret it!
B007FJFDXS|1.0|I got this from the free app a day and I would be so upset if I had paid for it.  The game is buggy and not entertaining at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|fast delivery Great book, I would recommend this product for anyone to buy, great service and no issues at all.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|This book gave me a new insight in digital photography, not just point and shoot, explore my camera and experience the joy of digital photography.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|no problems. great book I would recommend this product for anyone to buy, great service and no issues at all.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Could not stop reading! Easy and fun read. Will be reading more from this as author. Story was real and made me wanting more.

B008Q00LFK|5.0|Good VS Evil.  This is a classic David and Goliath tale.  The new guy tries to bring down the big giant company with an army of lawyers.  Guess who gets the last laugh?
B000055Y0X|5.0|Another great movie from childhood ! and this time a crisp,in sync looking movie !<br />seeing this movie reminds one of how crazy the world was then ( or could be ) with<br />the threat of &#34;the bomb &#34; dropping at any minute !! ( remember &#34; Duck & cover &#34; ) ?
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This is a great way to forget about the real problems of the world.  Well done, Like the cast. No problem with Amazon on streaming.
B00004XPPE|3.0|Remembered this movie from childhood, wanted to see it again uncut & crisp.looking .<br />movie started out .grainy,very dark ( almost black screen ) audio was out of sync for<br />first 25 minutes
B008IJT0CE|5.0|What a great idea!  You can play different sounds and play them together!  Plus the concentration function is great I used it while studying.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is the best CPU for your money. Whether you're a computer enthusiasts building a gaming rig, or new to the computer building scene, this is the right CPU for you. I was able to overclock this CPU to 4.73GHz using air cooling and it runs great at a steady 70c-80c under full load, and around 30c-35c while idle. Even then, a simple over clock to even 4.5GHz can decrease those temperatures down to 50c-60c. One thing I would like to mention is that the Ivy Bridge processors have a tendency to run much more hot than the Sandy Bridge do, so don't freak out if your temperatures are jumping to extremes that you aren't sure are safe. Intel guarantees a threshold limit to withstand 105c but reaching that would honestly be trying to overclock to 4.9-5.1GHz under air cooling. This processor can handle anything I throw at it and it's great for anyone who's thinking about building a new computer that will last them a while.
1419705849|5.0|My son is a Diary of a Wimpy Kid nut and he was so excited to have this book and read it all right away.  It shipped quickly.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|The characters are cute, the game is fun and challenging. If you like Diner Dash or similar games or are just a big Hello Kitty fan, this is a game you will love.
B001P06GX4|3.0|Item purchased as a gift based on previous reviews.  Nice box, easy to wrap. I've had no feedback from recipeient.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like knowing how much time left before I need to charge. Also lets me know battery is still good.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|Great movie for the whole family!  Fun music and good message! My kids love nature anyway, and now they wish there were really tress that were that colorful in real life! Too CUTE!
030758836X|3.0|But not great.  The layout of the story was the best part, but<br />I didn't like the writing, Short and choppy.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is terrible. It only loads the first 5 or so posts and that's it. Don't bother with the app and stick to the web browser, that way works great!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Very user-friendly. Easy to bid &amp; buy on my Kindle Fire when I'm away from home. As an avid eBayer, I love it!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Loved this movie.  Downloaded to my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9, that I am not so happy with, download took over 6 hrs and then within the last few minutes of the movie I got a download error (still do not know how movie ended), but yes got charged for the complete download.  Not real happy with the fact that I can not find a users guide for KF hd 8.9!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Having not read a John Grisham novel in a long time, I'm certainly not disappointed. I almost don't want the story to end because it has had my attention on every page!  A real page turner and it is hard to get anything else done because all you want to do is read this book.  Grisham does an outstanding job of weaving very intricate sub stories into the main plot---reminding of his first- A TIME TO KILL. Very entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was beyond great, I was missing out on so much. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys books and has free time. Even though the \\" hunger games \\" seems like something that is unlikely to happen the obstacles katniss faces play out in everyday life.
1449410243|5.0|I love the Oatmeal comics, and this includes a lot of cat comics that are new and never published online which is cool. Fun for cat lovers to read through
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book so far of the series. Jeff Kinney did wonderful. Cannot wait for the next book in this series
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I chose 5 stars because it's funny and entertaining plus, I've read all the diary of a wimpy kid books and I love them all
B001BANK32|5.0|Way different from the movie and much better in my opinion! I would definitely recommend reading this book with all the lights on!
B009SCRERI|5.0|The girls love this movie..and I am happy Amazon doesn't limit the amount of times they can watch it in a day. I love my kids but this movie keeps them away from us when we need to cook, clean, relax, etc... My girls are 2 and 4 years old...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A book about kids and cancer is going to tug at your heartstrings. What John<br />Green does well in \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is give the kids lives and commentary that do not dwell on the obvious.<br /><br />The narrator, Hazel, has an incurable cancer. She home schools, she goes to Support Group (with excellent caustic remarks unspoken), and truly cares for her parents. Her parents face the worst with courage, but of course they are clingy.<br /><br />Hazel meets a new guy at Support Group, Augustus. He has had one leg amputated. Their friend in common, Isaac, is about to lose his other eye.<br /><br />So the details are not pretty. But the kids find a way to be kids. They are fairly philosophical at times, and mad-cap ridiculous at others. What I loved about Hazel and Gus is that they settled on \\"Okay\\" as short-hand for \\"always\\" or \\"I'll love you always.\\" They have hormones, they want to live and experience life.<br /><br />Most of all, they want to find answers to the book that brought them together, An Imperial Affliction. They both email the author and wait and wait and wait for answers. They know that as cancer patients they will get the \\"victim credit\\" and probably hear from him.<br /><br />What they don't know is \\"the fault in our stars,\\" what fate has in store for them in terms of their lives and their illness.<br /><br />Green handles the improbable with grace. This is a fine YA that will bring a smile to your face even as you are crying your eyes out. Lovely, lovely book.
1416987118|5.0|This is a cute and fun book. The kids love the building tension as the story gets closer and closer to the bear. My 3-year old is still a little nervous about the book, but the older ones love it.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Interesting little story.  Basically a Kung-Fu president vs evil vampires. I think I prefer Daniel Day Lewis version of the story...
B0079R8IYW|5.0|This is a very sturdy cover.  It folds back to use as a stand for the Kindle Fire.  The Fire is secure and doesn't flop around in the cover.  When shut, it &#34;locks&#34; into place.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It does the job of protecting the Fire well without a big pricetag.  I would recmmend it to anyone who has a Kindle Fire.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a fantastic visual experience that does not deserve the poor picture quality of Amazon's streaming service. We paid $5 for the HD version, not only was it not HD, it was worse than SD. I got a headache trying to focus my eyes on the pixelated images. I stream excellent HD quality movies with Netflix, so I don't know what Amazon's problem is,
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|We decided to purchase this movie instead of renting it and I'm glad we did! They (our 3 kids...all under the age of 7) have watched this movie 4 times in a row(paid for itself already)! This is not the norm with our purchases. Usually they watch it once then move on to something else.<br />Not to mention...I enjoy it myself.
1579124585|5.0|I ordered this as a last minute Christmas present for my son (who is an aerospace engineer) & it arrived very quickly and in nearly perfect condition.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase: both with the speed of delivery and with the quality of the book.  I was hesitant to buy a used book but I couldn't find any new ones for a reasonable price so I ordered this.  I really cannot tell that anyone has ever used this.  All the pages are clean & unmarked.  There are a couple of very small tears in the dust cover but otherwise it seems perfect.  I am definitely impressed & pleased.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|I can't believe they are selling the same crap over and over. I just saw the first one, and then this one. There is absolutely nothing new on this film. The main character always stands with her legs apart in a &#34;cool&#34; fashion... in every scene where she is not absurdly jumping or rolling. Story, same as always, end, same as always, clichés, same, same, same as always. The &#34;visual effects and the sound effects are the same you saw and heard back in the 70's with Star Wars. I, personally am tired of this and I don't get it why they don't come up with something new at least with the sound effects... This film &#34;borrowed&#34; beside than Star Wars, from Alien (The little girl), from Total Recall (The first and yes, the second, and probably the third when they do it!) and of course any George Romero zombie film-but then again, everybody is doing zombie flicks now days. Hollywood...INVENT SOMETHING NEW FOR PETE'S SAKE! Gotta go! I'm off to see Sherlock Holmes and Edgar Allan Poe as &#34;action&#34; heroes, and then Abraham Lincoln battle some zombies. Can't wait to see &#34;Hansel and Gretel&#34;...
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|If a Dr. Who fan, who couldn't like this series? Another interesting new sidekick and a series of strange new adventures. While each story is complete in itself (including the two-part stories), the whole season definitely wraps up nicely in the end episode.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Good visual effects &amp; story. A good value for the price with just enough challenge so it doesn't get frustrating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this down. Great story line and so many unexpected twists, but ended on such a happy note and lots of HOPE to anybody that has endured sexual abuse or dealt with suicide.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|This is an interesting app for the first few minutes but it does get old pretty quick.  Would be nice if they added a few other shaped items and maybe a feature like a gravitational field
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Greatest rock-n-roll musicians of our time plus Eric Clapton did a great job putting the program together.  I highly recommend this DVD.
0545265355|5.0|I got these for my kid and he loved them, he is 13 years old and could not put them down
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Fun but very frustrating LOL<br />Everyone should judge it for themselves, as everyone has different tastes and their own<br />  ideas of fun. Give it a try for yourselves
B007FJFDXS|2.0|I found the controls to be inconsistent and overt touchy on kindle fire hd. Wouldn't recommend. Seemed fun at first, but as you move up levels controls become more and more frustrating.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Takes pretty decent videos but I have yet to find a way to delete videos from the video gallery. I also have yet to figure out if you can upload the videos you record.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|The late-eighties TV series is rebooted with jolts of sentiment, personal discovery, and wild comedy.<br />21 Jump Street gets the remake job done with tongue-in-cheek style & plenty of outrageous moments.
B0091QS88K|1.0|I hate that game it is a very bad game and it is for babies I gave it one star.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Wow, this was a really emotional picture. It gives the viewer a peek into the world of bad guys vs. the U.S.A military and what can happen when we go after the bad guys in the world to stop a senseless act. Maybe more bad guys need to see this film and maybe they would think twice about messing with the wrong end of the bull. I'm very proud of my country and the people who protect our borders and it's citizens. No one can tell me there is a better place to be on this earth than right here in the United States of America. HUURAHH!! to all who have come before me and will come after me to serve this great nation!!! We need more films like this one, thanks to the folks who made this one and so many others like it......GOD BLESS AMERICA
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really wanted to be caught off guard and surprised by this book, but I was not. I saw plot turns before they happened, and even saw the ending coming from almost the beginning. I debate whether that dismisses the book overall.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed the read. I thought it was a good psychological-type thriller, and it kept me turning the pages. It only took me an afternoon to read, so it was not a huge time commitment (which I like for a book I only marginally like).<br /><br />I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars, because I really do not know that it lived up to 4 star potential. I would recommend the book though, so it is better than a 3 star book.<br /><br />I think someone who is not a careful reader (and does not read a lot) will have a fun time with the book, as it will catch them off guard and unaware of the massive \\"twists\\" that the author attempts to make. If psychological thrillers are your reading genre, I might encourage you not to read it, because you will see the end far before the book is over.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This was very dark.  I read because it was written by the author of Gone Baby (?), so thought I would read first.  Haven't read Gone Baby yet.<br /><br />Enjoyed, but don't think I would choose again.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I llke Blake's writings and this one really came through. Normally I can figure out the plot and the villian(s) halfway through the book. Not this one and the ending caught me totally offguard!
B007P7UF0G|5.0|What I expected.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The movie is beyond belief. The soundtrack I did find wanting, not in the quality of the music but in the quantity of the songs. There were glaring songs missing and they were some of the most popular of the music from the musical. I know they were in the movie, I heard them myself and became teary eyed when I heard them. I don't know why they didn't include them. Maybe the music company will come out with a full soundtrack soon, and I know I will get it, but why not include the beloved songs. I can't give it a five star review because of that otherwise I would give it in a heartbeat.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|What I expected.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I loved that it was written from the perspective of the dog! Made me laugh. Made me cry. Made me believe that my dogs really do understand what I'm saying!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|What I expected.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|Mark Wahlberg really is the sexiest man in the world.  This character has chrisma and just can't wait for him to make it all right.
0545265355|5.0|gift for someone else
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I've listened to this album many, many times and thoroughly enjoy all of the songs and it has become one of those that I often have playing when I need to study or take really long drives. It's become one of my favorites.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|What I expected.
1616960922|4.0|Brandon Sanderson never ceases to amaze me! I am astonished at how quickly he is able to put out books and how engaging they are.<br /><br />I did not know what I expected from this book, but it was a fun read for a few hours and reminded me why I enjoy reading his writing so much.
B008B11R1Q|4.0|What I expected.
B001O05X2U|4.0|The best way to describe Mika and this album would be HAPPY. Whenever we are down or need/want some happy music we put on this album.
0316228532|5.0|What I expected.
B009JBZH54|4.0|The movies are fantastic.  Took away one star because I can't get the included digital copy.<br /><br />My problem with this particular product is with the Ultraviolet digital copy that comes with it.  It doesn't work plain and simple.  I've tried several times over the last two days and received errors when attempting to redeem the code that comes with the box.  Flixster Customer Service (non-existent) for this consists of the same lame form letter being sent over and over to apologize with my issue with their service and assures me someone is working on it.  However their knowledge base states there are no current issues with their service.<br /><br />That makes this product a rip off.  You pay for the blu-ray disks and digital copy and you only get the blu-ray disks.  Seems like fraud to me.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|Loved the artwork, the 1993 concert DVD and the CD with extras. Can't wait to buy another SP deluxe editions.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have it on my android phone and it's awesome, but it's so much better on my Kindle Fire! No lagging, zero freezing, no problems.  love it.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I think some of the previous Batman movies were better but the action scenes were good in this movie. Lots of action!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A very good story keeps you coming back for more sorry I am finished already. Ready to start next book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you're looking for a good book that will make you emotional this is definitely it. Kept me up all night because I couldn't  put it down. If you're buying it for your kindle it's worth more than $3.99! Great book for the money!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|... says it all.  App runs true on time left estimations.  Easy enough for anyone to follow.  Even reminds you to plug in at the best level for your uses.  kudos~
B007V65R54|5.0|You should read this book to explore what you think you know and what you should know (and also what is yet to be discovered) about pollers and bias does to the world we live in. A must read for anyone trying to expand there mind. I'm a 24 year old accountant, if that gives you any incite as to where I'm coming from.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining game. I just downloaded it to my kindle and highly recommend. It's great for a relaxing evening at home
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was a pretty good book but not my favorite of the series. I would still recommend it to people who the likes series it's classic Diary of a Wimpy Kid
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book reads like a memoir for the most part. I had trouble putting it down. It is two parts memoir, one part science and one part metaphysics/religion. He does a better job of describing what happens in this world than in heaven, which seems indescribable.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book pissed me off. This is all I have  to say. It was greatly written but very angering and kinda confusing.
B004ULEEY8|4.0|OK, so the story line for this movie is little bad, but that is not the reason I bought this.  The whole reason I bought this is for the audio track and it did not disappoint in that area.  Some of the bass in this movie is so low it had my Rythmik FV15HP working in overdrive.  The LFE in this movie is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />If your purpose is low frequency extension give this movie a go.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|this show is so engrossing. watch it if you have a chance-you won't be disappointed. it's a sit on the edge of your chair program.
B00574P9EQ|3.0|This has appeal for the 10-15 year-olds.  The kids are really good at putting things over on their parents.  They get new ideas in case they don't think of those things themselves.  It is realistic and the kids are no plaster saints.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does what it says - the best way to see how your name battery is doing.<br />Get it you will not regret it!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|For a tile matching game it is pretty good. It has a story at least. I'm having fun so far anyways. There should be a shuffle button though. Well enough enjoy!
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|I watch lots of moves lately including those instant. Having FIOS 25/25Mbps internet link I take advantage of watching in HD which has always been much better comparing to standard definition.<br />The Expandables is an exception. This move is made grainy for purpose by producer like it has been shot on the film. Its ok when you watch it in theatre or on Blu ray. But on instant it is just terrible. Because of granurality, video compression makes picture unacceptable in quality unlike other movies I watched instant. This movie and similar should not be even advertized to watch instantly unless link between server and user is guaranteed to be 75Mbps or better which is not a case. Do not waste time watching this movie instantly. You might be disappointed.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|very nice quality for the money.  I like the way it can stand up when watching a movie or even reading.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|A bit too sappy for me and slow. There's too much love and longing for a 16 year old. Not sure how the ending will be
B0094BB4TW|4.0|this app world I don't know why everyone else is having problems but mine works perfectly fine. Kinda slow buts fast enough
B0042VJSVU|5.0|i ordered the SB700 to shoot on my D700 and got exactly what I expected. A high quality flash at a great price.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really enjoy the creativity of this game!!!! You really have to use your brain to solve all the levels!!!!! I also love that u can actually have more than one choice! !!! Overall this game is great on a Kindle Fire!!!!!!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|This is a fun hidden object game with a few puzzles sprinkled between.  Problems occur when you  magnify to find objects--you are penalized by losing time when you touch the screen to move it around--game thsinks you are tapping for objects in the wrong place and it gets annoying.  Would also like to see a few more puzzles sprinkled in.  Otherwise, it's one of the better games I've tried.  Would recommend.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I love Bourne movies. Wasn't sure about Jeremy Rinner taking over for Matt Damon, but he did a good job. Hope they keep up making the Bourne series.
1609611543|5.0|I found the book very informative.  I did not know that wheat was so modified.  I can see where some of the health issues our extended family has suffered could have come from over use of wheat and other grains.  By going off grain I have been able to lose a considerable amount of weight so I am thrilled.  I do not think I will go back to using wheat again since I feel so much better.  Other members of my family are looking at my success and considering taking themselves off of wheat and other grains in order to feel better.  There is only a couple of things I did not like about the book and that is that it has some repetitions and the book is very scientific.  Don't get this if you are expecting it to read like a novel.  Get it as a book written by a Physician who is into the science aspect of writing.  You will not be disappointed in this book as a learning tool to help you feel better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|soooooo cool you can have so much fun playing together and solo totally worth the money you might think 7 dollars **** way worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008458O3S|3.0|i like this game, it is challenging, and i have to think out the solutions. not my favorite, but i like it.
B00170DEM8|5.0|One of my very favorite movies!! With terrific dancing and singing............and a wonderful story. One of Crosby and Astaire's best.
B0090YHSFC|2.0|couldn't figure this out too well. i guess i needed more help . maybe i just like a different type of game.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|As a beginner, I found it easy and satisfying to use. The instructions/ options were clear and easy to figure out.
B006O3MU96|2.0|never could figure it out! gave up and went on to another game! i guess i didn't get how to move.
098478280X|5.0|I red fourth version of this book, I have recently bought fifth version. It is full of very useful advices and directives. A mandatory tool for both preparing interviews and developing someone's computer science skills. I like programming puzzles and brain teasers in this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it, it was very insightful & inspiring. I would recommend it to all of my close friends & relatives.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Resident Evil: Retribution<br /><br />As a huge RE fan, I've often defended the films among my friends, but after seeing RE: Retribution, I just stopped bothering. I have rarely seen such a lousy film. I was so pumped about seeing it in the theater, then I saw it in the crowded theater of 9 people on opening day, and I was sorely tempted to get my money back.<br /><br />Now, I will say this, it is the continuity (or lack thereof) with the previous films that makes this movie so bad. On it's own, if you haven't seen any of the past films, you might not think it's as bad, although you may be confused.<br /><br />-The acting is okay, no complaints really, just a terrible story<br />-Paul W.S. Anderson can't seem to make up his mind about where he wants the series to go, and at this point, he's just spewing out generic garbage that makes his wife (Milla Jovovich)/him more money.<br />-The movie is completely riddled with plot holes. I could go on for days about how many there are. I will some of the big ones I noticed:<br /><br />1. No explanation as to what happened to the Redfields/ how Alice wound up underground<br />2. At some point during the apocalypse, the survivors managed to build a giant wall around the White House<br />3. Paul W.S. Anderson once again gave Alice back her powers after taking them away in the last film after giving them to her in the film before that (can't make up his mind)<br />4. There are now survivors holding out in the White house fort that Alice somehow missed when she was scouring the Earth for survivors in the last film<br />5. The Red Queen computer (the one that got fried in the first film) (the one that got replaced by the White Queen in the third film) is now the villain trying to kill all the survivors by making even more mutants (Let's face it, they stopped being zombies ages ago.) The same computer whose sole job was containing a zombie outbreak.<br />6. Wesker is now a good guy/ the president? No explanation of why or how thatcame to be, or why he couldn't stop the Red Queen alone since he is invincible<br />7. Alice knows who Ada Wong is...somehow.<br />8. The three Umbrella soldiers from the previous films are back, and it is revealed there are multiple clones of them. Though for some reason only three of them don't have helmets? Oh, and the good Rain was completely pointless.<br />9. The Umbrella soldiers outfits changed drastically...again.<br />10. Leon and the team kill hundreds of the Las Plagas zombies in the Russia dome, but when Rain injects herself with Las Plagas, she is invincible?<br />11. Why is the \\"Urban Dome\\" not just called Raccoon City? We flat out see a downed news helicopter that says Raccoon City on it<br /><br />Overall, this movie just feels insulting. They obviously cared nothing about the plot, so why should we? They brought back the cooler characters from the previous films as if that would draw us into seeing it. It just feels cheap. I wouldn't spend a cent on this film, even to complete my collection. If you are looking for a good RE film, watch Resident Evil: Damnation that came out around the same time.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game is okay.  There is an awful lot of dialogue, but you can get through it pretty quick.  Not my favorite game, but it works.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|We've got the series - love, love Gibbs and his interactions with the rest of the cast.  It's one of our favorites.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it. My son and I sit and play it for hours. If u have time on your hands and want a fun game, this is a great pixk
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Husband and son wanted the DVD ... got a new Blu Ray player so our first Blu-Ray and they loved it!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Buying this season in HD was the best thing we did. You literally feel like you are standing in the show, which is really strange with all those zombies.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|My boys love the angry bird space game.  I just wish the free version had a few more levels.  We ended up purchasing the full version within the same day! :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Cannot wait to read the next book!  Gives insight into why we like what we like and what turns us on
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I've received a lot of compliments on this case-it's very lightweight, durable, and cute. I love that I can set my Kindle to watch movies, read, whatever, hands free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It the best book you should read it all cause it is so good. Please read and give it a five star
B007QPFGJW|3.0|Have read many books but didn't think it was s good as Snowman!  I enjoyed it but did not like he ending.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a fantastic story of love that will keep you wanting to read more. I couldn't put it down.
0979019710|4.0|The Miracle Morning has been a wonderful way to start my day.  How many times have you woke up and wanted to role over and go back to sleep without having a sense of longing for the day?  I know I have, and after reading the first few chapters of Hal Alrod's book, The Miracle Morning, I already feel a sense of purpose and excitement to get my day started.  So far reading this book has offered a very positive and uplifting way to start my day.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone looking for positive personal development in their lives.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|this product is a good price and came promptly...that is one thing about ordering from you guys, the orders get to you fast...i would definitely recommend this product to others..
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Colorized version of Miracle on 34th Street. A wonderful tradition to watch every year. Will be watching this along with &#34;It's a Wonderful Life,&#34; &#34;A Christmas Carol,&#34; &#34;Elf,&#34; &#34;White Christmas,&#34;  &#34;The Santa Claus,&#34; & &#34;The Santa Claus II&#34;
B000FC27A4|5.0|I love this book. I'm enjoying it so much! The movie with Reese Witherspoon is a wonderful adaptation and made me interested in reading the story for myself.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Physics don't always seem to work they way I think, but a great game.  I would pay for I didn't get it for free.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It is not a great work of literature, but the romance heats up in this one compared to the first. Christian becomes a lot more likeable and I found my empathy for him increased exponentially. You may find yourself inspired to spice things up just a little in your own sex life as well. What happens in this book is not quite so over the top. I REALLY wish the author would not make so many references to Ana's \\"inner goddess.\\" That really got old.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Only problem with these are there just any other sets to go along with them, no extra kinds to order. My child LOVES minecraft so we have two set. But you cant order extra figures. So its hard to do alot of different stuff. I think they should have optional instructions on other things you can built with them also.
0425188809|5.0|Great book. For sure got me back into reading again. Dean Koontz is an amazing author. Look forward to reading more of his novels.
1594135851|5.0|Great book, enjoyed the series.  I like this type of book.<br />Hope that i can order more books like this and these prices.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This movie looks amazing on Blu-ray.  Luckily they do not show the actual shark much because when it does appear at the end it looks dated.  Classic physiological thriller that holds up to days standards.
159413586X|5.0|This was my kind of series, love the escape while reading these books.<br />Will order more of this kind of literature.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|This is a good fun action flick for the whole family.  I went in to the movie not knowing much about the series but enjoyed the movie none the less.
0439023521|5.0|I couldn't wait for the next book.  Enjoyed all of the series.  Looking forward<br />to more series type books.<br />Easy and fast read.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Not much to say about this movie it is one of the best super hero movies to hit the silver screen.  A fun action flick for everyone.  You do not need to really know the back story of each of the super heroes to enjoy the flick.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i really enjoyed this book it was hard to pit down once I started to read it and kept me interested
B004LWZWGK|5.0|An excellent conclusion to a Batman trilogy.  This has to conclude the best set of three super hero movies ever!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|it was not as compelling and took too many passages before a part got interesting enough to make you want to read more-too slow-too much description
B0060MYM7O|5.0|You can tell HBO is pulling out all the stops on this production.  It reminds me a lot of the HBO Series Rome in how crazy good the sets look.  This will go down as one of the best fantasy series ever made.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|works just fine and offers several use options - I would recommend this for any user of the Kindle Fire
B001AQO3QA|4.0|What can I say Alien and Aliens are two of the best films ever.  This Anthology is worth it for just the first two movies.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just downloaded Kindle for my Android tablet computer. I had been using Kindle for PC. The download was great. It works just as well as the Kindle for PC. I am completely satisfied.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love this site. Everything you can think of is here. Tons of ideas and information. Recommend this site.  One of the best sites.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|love it. I loved happy feet two at the movies and is great to have it for my grandchildren to view any time they want to.
B00328R21C|5.0|My Grandson is a Star Wars fanatic. He loves anything Star Wars. He can tell you the names of every character.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I saw this movie with my grand-daughter at the cinema and i love watching it again. I am sure they will too
B001H4NXCK|5.0|I dare anyone watching this the first time to predict where the plot leads, it's so filled with twists and turns.  James Garner does excellently as the sheriff (instead of the character he played in the TV series).<br /><br />The quality of the DVD was excellent, although double-sided (one side full-screen, the other widescreen).
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is a nice app and very reminiscent of Mario circa 1993. Would like to see more apps from this company.
B00A757EFW|3.0|kinda hard to play. The joy stick is touch, but since it's virtual, you are off it without knowing and of course your eyes can't be two places at once.  Not that great a game.  Really takes a lot of getting used to.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Exciting with twists up to the end.  The battle of wills both physically and mentally was excellent.  I have watched it twice now and will watch this movie many more times I am sure.
1439152802|5.0|Having read Kate Morton's previous three books and hearing her speak at a book launch (and yes, she's a lovely person), I was really looking forward to reading The Secret Keeper.  It had all of the elements I'd loved in her previous novels - well-drawn characters, meticulous research woven into the narrative, timelines going back and forth between the past and present, and of course lots of secrets and mysteries.  However, it took me longer to engage with the story compared with her previous books.  I couldn't put my finger on it because everything was there that makes a great novel, but I think I felt a lack of connection with some of the main characters.  This is not because of the way in which they were written - Kate does a brilliant job of that as always.  But I personally found it hard to relate to Laurel and Dolly in particular, especially as some of the flaws in Dolly's character became more apparent.  It wasn't that I didn't like them, but I found myself not really caring about them either.  I needed someone like Grace from The Shifting Fog or Eliza from The Forgotten Garden or Edie from The Distant Hours.  However, when the character of Vivien was explained in more detail, I'd found my point of connection.  Vivien's voice was the one that resonated with me and I cared what happened to her and by association, Jimmy.  As with The Distant Hours, however, all is not as it seems.  Just when you think you have a good understanding of the characters, everything is turned on its head and you see things from another perspective that changes everything.  The twist caught me off guard and made for a very satisfying conclusion that tied all of the loose ends together.  As some other reviewers have noted, I then felt like I wanted to go back and re-read sections in the light of what I now knew.<br /><br />I'm in awe of the way in which Kate keeps the different timelines and perspectives in order, seamlessly moving from one to the other.  Even minor scenes contain richdetails which often turn out to be significant later on.  As there is so much happening in this story, you need to read it over a relatively short period of time so that you can keep all the facts in your head.  It's not that it's a difficult read.  On the contrary, Kate has an engaging style of writing that makes you want to keep reading.  There's just a lot going on.  And although it took me a bit longer to fully engage with this one, the payoff was more than worth it.  With four great books in a row, I can't wait to see what Kate comes up with next.
B0091LRZX4|4.0|This vinyl is a great album to own, especially for Alicia Keys fans.  It comes on two 150g vinyls, with 3-4 songs a side (ideal).  No gatefold, just a simple cover with paper sleeves.  No mp3 download code, either.  Sound quality is top notch, really helps you appreciate her art for what it is.  Excellent imaging and dynamic range - crank this bad boy UP.<br /><br />A note regarding distortion on the album - it's part of the master.  I thought it was the pressing or my turntable, but listening to the iTunes version you can hear the same distortion in the same places.  So, call it an artistic (or bad engineering) choice, it is what it is.
B000089RV6|5.0|this was a gift for one of my kids he grew up listening to this type music ,ordering is fast and easy
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love how you unlock the different jedi birds as you go along. Great fun for the whole family, my 3 yr is obsessed with Angry Birds and loves playing all day long...
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Great game, easy and fun love to play every night before bed helps me relax. Best part I was able to get it for free!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is a very underrated rock record. It is no nonsense good rock and roll. No ballads, some of the lyrics are a little dated and corny but I love it. Better than Sonic Boom and Psycho Circus, great record.
B00846REIS|3.0|Good read, kept me reading until the very end.<br />The only thing that I disliked was how I couldn't ignore all the obvious similarities that the story line, conflicts, and the characters resembled Fifty Shades of Grey. The two main characters are Gideon Cross & Eva which immediately made me think of Christian Grey & Ana from Fifty Shades. Coincidence? Hopefully the resemblance dissolves a bit with the rest of the series.
0525953728|5.0|Great stories & of course the work up to the bin laden mission. This guy caught a lot of unwarranted flack for this book by our government and other than not sucking up to our leaders I don' see why. Great book, these guys are true warriors and super heros. I am humbled by these men and their sacrifices.
1449410243|2.0|Loved the book until I saw it had a section on how to tell if your cat is a homosexual.  May hurt the feelings of some people!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addicting and will teach you patience as you wait for all the prizes, levels, and shakes just like. In the arcade. Lots of fun!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|i have to say i didnt really think that i would like this story but it was good and not very predictabble.  I would have liked to have the plot revealed sooner seems that the author drgged it out to long but otherwise a good book!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Okay well I downloaded this on a kindle fire HD device brand new and well the app wouldn't let me search anything and it froze my kindle which I was not happy abt. And it took me like 20min. To download 1 video  do not download app
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game the graphics were top notch as was the story.  Absolutely no issues with my KF. I highly recommend purchasing the game.

B00498TQV8|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and you are there with her through the entire journey.  The tenacity of her character is so touching and compels you to want her to get what she needs just as much as she does.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My son-in-law was thrilled with this gift in Blu-Ray!  He was very happy with this product and the collection as a whole.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fantastic gameplay. Great storyline. Enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours. Everything from the voice-overs to the graphics make this a satisfying game.  An all around wonderful purchase!
0307895475|5.0|beating the main quest without the guide was no biggy but it didn't hurt to have it when doing all the side quests not to mention all the info it has does come in handy
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I can't read Seuss without imagining the voice of Danny Devito in my head now. My kids love this movie.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|its great i play it all the time.  The computer kicks my butt, but its a better time killer then brick breaker on my phone.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is amazing! This comes in handy when making a book report, teaching,  and keeping tracks of anything really! I would also suggest getting skitch (free) as well. Once you have both of these apps, you can sync them. I have these apps not only on my kindle fire, but on my Ipad as well. ihope this helps!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Awesome game! I love the ever increasing challenges -  well thought out, colorful, fun!<br />Brings in geography, history, and mythology, as well. &middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;really fun game! &middot;&middot;&middot;get it!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Enjoyed the whole thing. There were no slow bits, no plot holes and no shallow characters. Excellent story all around. I do not usually recomend Disney films but in this case I will make an exception. This on is a winner.
B007FJFDXS|4.0|Edge is a pleasant surprise.  Challenging FUN with great Replay value.  Here's what I like:<br /><br />1). Graphics great during game play.  Menus lettering is lower resolution but OK.<br />2). Cube Movements are extremely Smooth and Fluid.<br />3). You can Rotate the screen by pinching during game play - helps to see off screen areas.<br />4). Music is Very Good and Sound Effects are EXCELLENT and add to enjoyment.<br />5). Controls work well on my Xoom Tablet.  No problems found so far.<br />6). Speed and Direction of Cube movements are controlled well by your finger.<br />7). Lots of OPTIONS and Difficulty level can be selected by player.<br />8). Menus are good and helpful though a little TOO BRIGHT for my liking.<br /><br />OVERALL:  I like the game play very much.  It is a great GEOMETRIC PHYSICS type game that keeps you engaged and satisfied with increasingly difficult 3D Block Puzzles.  It even has some MOVING Blocks that increase the challenge but are lots of fun.  Some Smaller Cubes can be acquired for Bonuses also. Edge is a KEEPER that is a Nicely done, Unique app that I would recommend for all ages.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have only used the pdf portion of this suite but so far I love it!  I guess I'll see how the rest goes soon!
B008I43DYU|3.0|This is so handy to have on your Kindle.  I got my Kindle for Christmas and it is the best gift ever
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book 2. I could not put it down. It is a must read!!!!<br />It not that different from the first book, but it has more romance between Katniss, Peers, and Gale.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|Yes, we 'loved' it!  The only  negative was the visible foreign language at the bottom of the screen....very distracting..let us know when a DVD has the forein language at the bottom before we buy...
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I purchased the SwiftKey 3 App cause they were offering a new color Berry. But after installing the App the new Berry color isnt on the App. And just realize that the version I was supposed to get from Amazon hasnt been updated yet and at this time there is no update. But other than that its a very useful App to have and im hoping that it will be updated.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book in awesome continuation to the series heroes of Olympus ha  the same action and twist of pure awesomeness towards the end and I highly recommend this book to all ,but only if you have read  the first book and the 2nd book aswell
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather has become one of my most used information apps.  It is easy to access, with its very reconizable sun icon.  The information is clear and accurate.  I have recommended it to family and friends, prefering it to other weather apps.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Got this the other ...had heard a lot about it.  It is fun way to pass some time.  Some levels easy so you can play, others little harder as you get further into the game to make it challenging.
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|It is a lot of fun to watch her little face light up with delight as she . moves through the game.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|Save graphics from over a decade ago but with the save, amazing fun factor. This is a must have for any puzzle game lovers.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I recently discovered Sophie Kinsellas' books and absolutely love them.  Her books are written with such wit and charm along with with a great story line of adventures. I have a hard time putting them down! I can't wait to read the rest of her books.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|As per previous reviews does NOT work. I didn't even get one picture out of it. After download I got error screen. DO NOT BUY THIS piece OF GARBAGE. There are no magic updates for this app. It simply does not work. Someone is scamming. This app came up as recommended by amazon. Why are they not removing it?
0802473156|5.0|I love The 5love languages because I learn a lot from it. I didn't know what it was my love languages neither my husband  but I do know now. I even brought it for my friends and also I refer many married couple to it. That was a DIVINE inspiration from Dr Chapman. I begging you if you married or have family and friend who married did not know about that book please do so. it will bring a big changes to your marriage.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study was recommended by a friend, and it is the most complete study of how what we eat affects our health and well-being, as well as our weight.  It is a good guide for healthy eating habits for a lifetime.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use facebook everyday. I certainly like the mobile applications for it to be used on a tablet or smartphone.
0385486804|5.0|This is a great book for readers of all types and must read for people interested in the outdoors. Even though you know the outcome before reading the book, Krakauer does an amazing job of reporting his findings and keeps you wanting to get deeper into the backstory. I'm in no way an avid reader but found this book very hard to put down at times.
1451620829|3.0|As someone who has followed KISS for over 35 years I am eager to read any biography on the members (especially the original four).<br />This was a good book and (I believe) an honest story about KISS behind the scenes and Peter's life.<br />Having read Ace Frehley's book No Regrets, this book just reinforces the rumor (or fact) that Gene and Paul ruled the roost and called all the shots.<br />Peter gets very candid (sometimes too much so) in this book, but overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it to KISS fans.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The eBay app is great! It allows you to access your user account and add items to your watch list. You have access to all the features eBay offers. I've got it on my Kindle Fire HD and it lets me browse ebay easily and efficiently.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Valentine Davies' story comes to life in one of the best Christmas films Hollywood ever produced.  Edmund Gwenn  earned his Best Supporting Oscar (he should have been nominated for a &#34;Leading&#34; role) as the quintessential Kris Kringle.  Natalie Wood showed her immense talent in this classic and Maureen O'Hara shone, as usual, as the no-nonsense manager and mom who hired Kris to instill the true spirit of Christmas in the cold heart of retail.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|This is ideal as a sleeve.  The only downside is for someone who wants a handle or way to attach to something for easier hands free carrying.  Sleeves aren't intended that way but is the only downside I see
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|im a big fan.  so i wanted to be able to watch all the first episodes again whenever i wanted.
0761171703|5.0|I got this book for my best friend who loves to dance. We watch &#34;So You Think You Can Dance&#34; together every season and I thought this would be the perfect gift for her. Plus, there are some SYTYCD alumni in the book, which was an awessome surprise!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|i enjoy collecting movies and also enjoyed this movie well so i wanted to add it to my collection of movies.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />IT GOT TO THE DESTINATION ON TIME AND THAT IS A GOOD THING.<br /><br />I LOVE THE CONCERT THE VIDEO AND THE CD. I LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME IN MY CAR.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Heard about it on tumblr and wanted to read  it. Lovely written and simple to follow. I loved it simply put
B00005JPS8|5.0|Well done movie I love to watch over and over. Great action and story line. Interaction between characters is great.
B00701897I|5.0|Have been a fan of tintin since I was 6..... Cool movie..... Excellent 3D effects....Steven Spielberg rocks.... A movie for the whole family ..... Nice and clean....
0312380852|5.0|This book is a power house of macrame techniques. It has very intricate detailed instructions for advanced micro macrame work. Beautiful vintage designs updated for todays materials. But these  definitely take time and patience, . A fabulous book for the advanced macrame beader.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|The plot was borderline incomprehensible even for a movie where the plot is of secondary interest.  The need to cash in on previous Bourne movies made the whole experience rather cheesy, and interesting ideas about genetic engineering were lost in the shuffle.  Abrupt ending, and a waste of good talent from Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Ed Norton.  Renner and Wiesz had little chemistry, a likely outcome of the questionable film making.  Fairly pointless character development just to have an action sequence or explosion.  Rent Skyfall when it's available on Amazon; now there's good espionage and conspiracy and good action.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|So many faces by Claire. This show is amazing and very intense. I definitely recommend watching it, especially if you liked 24.
B004KKXMSI|3.0|The set was a great price for great movies, but the case was broken. The discs weren't damaged but the inside of the case was cracked and will probably break off.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Even if you are not in to zombies you can still love this show. Season 3 is the best yet.
B000NY12LO|4.0|My only complaint about this book is the author's excessive use of the words, \\"knapsack\\" and \\"sequestered.\\"  Overall, a pretty decent book.
B0086213XW|2.0|When I first read the reviews I thought it can't be that bad. It was ok until it got towards the end. It ends terrible. Not great.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|A challenge for us all! Once you start, you cant put it down. Highly recommend this to everyone. Have fun!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Ewan and Emily do a great job. It is a very good movie for those that like films that involve much conversation.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Excellent novel. Great read, with excellent intrigue, plot twists, suspense, dark side of human nature, and interesting facts about crimes related to the story. The movie cannot capture all that is in the novel.
B00064VR0W|5.0|This was the music from my era.  I was pleased with the concert.  Rod's music is timeless and was a vital part of the 80s (I was there).
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting premise, very good story, interesting characters, and fast moving. For me as an adult, there was a little too much teenage kissing but I think that is something that younger readers better relate to.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for android works as advertised. It is a great application. No problems with it. Two big thumbs up. if you like to read on your mibile this is for you.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is the newly/modernized version of the old story of Hachi. If you own and Akita, or shall I say &#34;if they own you&#34; you must have this movie!
B0049J2CKE|4.0|Ratatouille was a sentimentally sweet film with an over the top plot that no one could mistake as anything but a cartoon for entertainment.  Your senses will not be assaulted by sex and violence.  Your ears will not be stung by profanity.  Although the typical Hollywood need to portray the Dad of the family as an insensitive idiot, he does come to his senses in the end.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Takes some thought but holds your attention for each level.  Variety and enjoyment so keeps you engaged.  Highly recommend for all ages.
0316069434|5.0|The Black Box could be Connelly's best. He once again brings reality to every page.  I was really struck by the realism of the acrimonious relationship between Harry and his boss.  The plotline adds plenty of obstacles to investigating a cold case that no one wants solved, due to possible political fallout. Harry has to go off the ranch to seek justice as only Harry can. I really enjoyed the book, and I was dissapointed when I reached the last page.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Great series!  It is nice to have options to catch up on episodes that I missed.  I recommend this show to anyone interested in fantasy.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|Enjoyed the show enough to purchase the 2nd series and will purchase the 3rd when it is available. Very Interesting and liked the characters.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is very enjoyable.  This game has a theme with a story behind.  I find more enjoyable than a normal Mahjong game.  Decided to try as they were offering free, is well worth purchasing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Serene music is in the background for these puzzles that challenge you just enough to keep you going.  Highly recommended this for puzzle enthusiasts or the casual user.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Finally a great inspirational movie for young girls and the whole family to enjoy! Just the kind of role model I want for my daughter and have been waiting to see in animation!
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I loved the 3 set DVD. I attended the concert at the Pond in Anaheim.  The DVD brought back memories of Barbra's concert.  She sounds and looks fabulous.  Great treat.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Some people loved it.  Some despised it.  Most are probably, like me, somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />There's no need for arguing about it.  It's just a movie.  I have loved comic books since I was a kid and love that movies are being made from them.  The thing about these movies - and especially complaints about reboots - is that new writers and artists take over characters in the comics all the time.  They change things...they make the costumes different...they alter the timelines and sometimes totally screw up the continuity.  The writers, directors, and actors are doing the same thing with comic book movies.<br /><br />Now that we have that perspective, we can watch and enjoy TDKR for what it is: the end to a director's take on the Batman and his world.<br /><br />Before I dive into TDKR I should say that I enjoyed both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight very much.  The dark, realistic feel of Christopher Nolan's take on Batman is closer, I think, to what Batman is in the comic books.  And I think that these movies are what DC fans have wanted/needed for their favorite character(s).  That being said, The Dark Knight Rises, to me, is more of a letdown than anything and I think some people get angry at hearing anyone criticize it in any way just because they are so attached to the character.<br /><br />Long and drawn out is not equal to \\"epic\\" in my book.  But I couldn't help feeling flashbacks of Star Wars: Episode 1 (the big fish scene, among others) as I watched this movie in the theater.  Okay...fine...he climbs the wall to escape and it's symbolic and a very good metaphor.  Then he falls.  Then he falls again.  This whole scene takes up too much time as we're watching, basically, nothing happen.  He's healing from a broken back.  He tries the climb.  He falls.  He tries again.  He falls.  The point I'm getting at here - and the reason I brought up Episode 1 - is that there is a lot of filler in this movie.  I like a good story as much as anyone and can beas patient as needed.  What I don't have patience for is filler used to make the plot drag on longer than necessary.<br /><br />Something that removed me from the dark, realistic magic I felt with the first two films is the voice of Bane.  I had looked forward to seeing how they took on the man who broke Batman's back and was pretty let down.  The voice was just...cartoonish and silly.  He sounded jolly and amused throughout the whole movie instead of angry and vengeful.  Just a wasted opportunity.  But that's the comic book fan in me talking.<br /><br />When done well, I can return to a previously read comic book or previously watched movie and not feel too burned out.  This...is not one of those movies.  I don't think I went in with my expectations too high.  The first two were top notch for the genre and showed that the character (or \\"franchise\\" if you want to think in business terms) was in good hands.  While it was decent to watch once, I doubt I will revisit The Dark Knight Rises again anytime soon.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy has done it again with THREAT VECTOR !  The manner in which he weaves in and out, at first focusing on Ryan Jr, then Clark, and the other characters leaves one deep in suspense, though a glaring weakness related to the NOC Wang (?) and the FBI traitors as well as the final &#34;disposition&#34; of Ran's girl friend up in the air.... unlike previous novels.  Also the threat of a cyberwar left me with a heightened sense of safety and wonderment - even though a work of fiction - as to just how many hackers are out there!  suspenseful and entertaining!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this on my Android phone and my Kindle. Great game, works quite well, never freezes, great graphics. Probably the most reliable app I use.
0756697875|5.0|My first grader received this for Christmas...he LOVES legos and Batman...this combines his two favorites.  He has several other similar Lego books.  They encourage him to read about his favorite characters.
0425252868|5.0|I heard about A Higher Call on NPR the other day so I decided to give it a go because I loved Unbroken and stories of good people preserving when the world seems against them. I never expected what I stumbled into. This book is the next Unbroken. It's the next epic WWII story.<br /><br />The stars of A Higher Call aren't the airplanes. They're the heroes who happen to fly these remarkable machines. There's a hero for everyone: obviously Charlie Brown and Franz Stigler! Every review has covered them but what about Ecky Eckenrode? Nobody talks about him.<br /><br />He's Charlie's little, quiet tail gunner who went around asking his buddies before the big mission to see if they'd give him their standard-issue candy bars. The next day was the bomb group's Christmas party for the English children of the neighboring village and he wanted to give them chocolate as presents. You love Ecky, I did at least.<br /><br />What about Marjorie Ketcham, the WASP pilot who falls in love with Charlie and him with her? She's described in this book so beautifully you can sense her 40s charm and elegance.<br /><br />How about Marseille, the 22 year old ace who is a playboy and jokester/trouble maker who welcome Franz into his dent in the African dessert and pours him a glass of cognac then teaches Franz that they only must answer to God and their comrades, another reason to live and fight with honor?<br /><br />This book has something special: deep characters and deep drama. It all adds up to the kind of book you will read 2 or 3 times. Then you'll go see the movie which will follow in a year or two (It must!). Weakness wise I'd say the worst thing about A Higher Call is that eventually you get to the last page, a feeling you dread as the pages become lesser and lesser. I loved this book. I'm going to read it again. However, first things first, I had to write this review!
B008N1LL42|5.0|My family and I loved this movie...the soundtrack is great too.  A few foul words thrown in unnecessarily ... but the action is good.
1401923127|3.0|I have read about 20 pages or less, and having a hard time. Actually, I dont even remember where I have put this book.
B009CPES4I|3.0|A nice small movie. Very predictable plot, start to finish. Acting was solid if not inspiring. Location and visual was enchanting. A balanced view of India in the 21st Century.
0060763280|5.0|I enjoyed this book, read most of it, ... finally got to the end of the book... and had a moment of realization about the entire piece of literature.  I actually don't think the book is about making money, even though on the surface it seems to be.  Read it and see what you think, is it a surprise ending?
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Christian Bale - Solid and confident as the Batman.<br />Gary Oldman - Fit Commissioner Gordon, well.<br />Joseph Gorden Levitt - Exceptional<br />Bane - the bad guy, fit the part.
0688014291|4.0|A lot can be gained by learning one minute praise, one minute reprimand, one minute goal setting, etc.  It leaves you with 7 plus hours to just loaf all day and let your employees do what is needed, if that is what you choose.  Employees actually do like the one minute approach.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I brought it for my grandson and he absolutely loves it.  He played them immediately and told me how much they mean to him.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart.  Wow, he is somewhat hard to understand, but such a briliant writer.  It took me three starts... then a total week at the beach alone, before this started to resonate.  But when it did!  I couldnt put the book down.
0060245867|5.0|Book is great but I hate the sticker they put on the front, hard to get off with no residue.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|It was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He is one of the best witers of modern times. i love a really good mystery and this is one of the best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this book because i loved it when i read it in class with Mr. Rose. This book is awesome.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great movie. Loved this movie and I can't wait for a part 2. Buy it you won't be disappointed with it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best book I have read the best book of the series so far to me love it
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I became a fan of the show last year and with the new season beginning in January (for the U.S.), I wanted to catch up beforehand.  I also like the behind the scenes additions.  This would be a great gift for the Downton Abbey fan.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It's an a amazing book, I loved it and can't wait for the house of Hades. Although I'm going to be waiting another year:(
B001BFWYXY|5.0|At first I was going to give this album four stars because it is essentially an early live concert recording of many songs that are performed better on Live at Fillmore East. But I gave it five stars because it is outstanding  raw,essentially uncut performance by the Allmans at one of the largest concerts of the era(with more people than Woodstock a year earlier).Many of the Era's great acts were there,including Hendrix and Jethro Tull. was a 10 year old in nearby Warner Robins at the time, and rode through the concert area with my grandparents to &#34;see the Hippies&#34;.And they were there by the hundreds of thousands, many listening to the music from the shelter of the surrounding pecan groves due to the intense 100+degree Georgia heat. About a dozen dehydrated concert goers hitched a ride in our 65 Chevy longbed and got off at the nearby creek to cool off and get a very much-needed bath.It was an unforgettable experience.This album takes me back to that time and place.In the still of the night I could hear this concert rumbling in the distance.42 years later I get to hear what some of that rumbling actually sounded like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book. If you like action and love this is a series for you. Be warned though, there is a lot of deaths.
B005ZCH9FC|5.0|I chose this film, because it looked funny and the actors in it I rate highly.<br /><br />I chose this rating, because that is what it deserved.<br /><br />I thought it was funny.  I couldn't find anything in it that I disliked.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who has got a good sense of humour.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the best action book ever read outstanding, beautiful ,lovely.I think I'll read it again . Thank you imagination
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Nice Case, works well and not to bulky. Recommend this to anyone who needs it for a cover. fits nice.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was a cute story. I liked that it was told in the view of someone who is quiet but has a good heart. My only complaint is that it's really not the typical life of a high school freshman. I would definitely recommend it to people.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This was a  good book.<br />This is a book I would love to have. This is on of the best book I've read
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I actually download the MPs album....<br />Her voice is perfectly suited to the songs, especially some of the more up-tempo ones!  Most of the songs (and I'm a Standards vocalist by trade) I was not familiar with, so that was fun!<br />The arrangements were a little over-powering at times for her voice. Think Leon Redbone guitar and bass and you've got the sound.  She's not a belter, thank heavens, so at times her voice was lost in the heaviness of the accompaniment.  That's why it didn't get 5 stars from me, but it's a really good collection of music done very well.<br />Recommended!
B008S4YZCO|4.0|The itty bitty cute monsters are adorable!! But sometimes it force closes. :( please fix. Other than that it is great!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|When I selected this case through Amazon Vine, I thought I had chosen a case that fit the original Kindle classic, not the Fire. When it showed up and said Fire all over the packaging, I was a little annoyed but quickly found that the case fits my regular Kindle, albeit a bit tightly. That's okay because I prefer a tight fit as I know my Kindle will be secure.<br /><br />I love this cover! Can I say that again? I love this cover! It is beautiful, in a dark red leatherette. It is so much nicer than the $5 cover I bought at Five Below a year ago, simply to have a cover for my Kindle. I love the feel of it and find myself constantly running my fingers over the carved names of the various cities. I would readily pay full price for this cover.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is very very cool! Even though it is basically cheating, it really helps me. Maybe another thing to add is skins and texture packs would be wonderful. I love how I can change modes! Another great feature is iron doors, signs, lava, water, fire, and so much! Please note though that you must have minecraft full version for this to work. Thanks so much!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a pretty straight forward solitare game.  The only complaint that I have is sometimes in between games when the ads come up I cannot get back to the game.  It gets stuck on the ad.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Angry Birds.  Have played all of them and Star Wars is great.  Seems to have a higher difficulty level than some of the other versions so it really stretches your abilities.
1416583432|2.0|I am so disappointed with this book. A friend said it was good but I'm not feeling it. I didn't finish it because it read like a text book. If I wanted a school book I would have bought a school book. The Art of Racing in the rain is a GOOD book. Read that instead!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Great insights on the foolishness of folks that think and act over-protectively of everything and everybody and make minor problems much worse with their meddling so that minor problems become major problems. This is a book that I will read several times and continue to refer to. It's just that good and full of great insights. The author is an academic-type that pulls the sheet off of the academic scam as well as so many other scam industries like the medical, financial and political industries. I am surprised that a book like this even gets published. The author is delightfully disrespectful and insulting to such scammers as Alan Greenspan, Office of Management and Budget and George Washington's doctors. If you love the \\"system\\" and its scams you will hate this book. If you love the truth, this book will help set you free.
B005P3NPXG|5.0|I don't know how Seal did it but he is singing some of my all time favorite songs. Beautiful! Great gift idea too.
1592400876|2.0|I just couldn't stand the author's self conscious preciousness and the undertone of self congratulation that seem to fill every page.  There really isn't that much content in this book.  If you stripped away all the fluff you would be left with the equivalent of a a few online articles about punnctuation.  I really can't understand the appeal of this book. I had to give up halfway through
B000BISBDY|5.0|Liked the music, liked the artist, and will enjoy the music at my leisure.  Too bad that I'm lost for words at the moment.
031603973X|4.0|You have to take your time with this pop-up .  There are so many items on each page to discover and enjoy.  Would have given it a five but the pages do not pop-up smoothly at first.  So, be careful as you open each page.  You may have to assist in the full display of each page, but well worth the snags.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The triology is good entertainment and is intended to keep the grand kids occupied during the holidays.  Hopefully it works!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This is my favorite series on TV. Each of the actors is excellent. The stories are light-hearted yet action packed. The chemistry between the characters is warm and kinetic. Quality is terrific on my Kindle Fire HD. Must watch!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My grandson was thrilled to get this present.  Although he's only seven years old, he has almost completed its constructed which is not bad for an item which gives it a 14-year old assembly age.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great quality on my Kindle Fire HD!!! Terrific show! Must see! Each episode is a cliff hanger. The storylines are riveting, and the acting is really engaging.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Liked the music, liked the artist, and will enjoy the music at my leisure.  Too bad that I'm lost for words at the moment.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham continues to write very good books.  I gave this a &#34;4&#34; merely because this book follows some of his old formula.  A very good read, and it's a page turner.  It certainly beats out PLAYING FOR PIZZA, which I thought was a piece of junk.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|This is one of my top 10 films, and will be packed to go should I ever time travel to the future.  I was upset that I ordered the blue-ray + digital copy edition and was sent the plain blue-ray.  However, for $3.99, who am I to bitch?
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Probably my fault, but I had a bit of trouble keeping all of the characters straight.  Real red herring, an O'Henry surprise ending.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|If you are a true-blue Trek fan, this is the ONLY way to watch the original. Why? Because the blue-ray version is the only way you can toggle between the original special effect version and the new computer enhanced \\"restoration\\".
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I enjoy it and think it would be great for kids. Definitely not a mindless game. I hope the later levels keep ratcheting up the difficulty.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|kept me from doing anything else until i finished it.i  so i could keep reading had to go back and order the next one
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read everything Nelson DeMille has published.  My least favorites were this one and CATHEDRAL.  DeMille is a splendid writer, but the Panther dragged a bit for me.
0316069434|5.0|I have read every one of the Harry Bosch novels.  With each book I get more insight into the character.  It feels like catching up with an old friend and the city he lives in.  I highly recommend reading the entire series. To me Connelly is a true master of his craft. The Black Box is a good example just how good Connelly is as a writer in this genre.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked the fact that this experience came from a man of science, in this particular field of expertise.  Like to think there's more out there than a DMT final buzz
1608862801|4.0|This is a great addition to the tv show, and the writing is perfect. You can definitely hear the character's voices as you read and it has some great little extra tid bits along the bottom of the pages. There is a bit on the history of the Land of Oo as well. Totally Mathmatical!
B005HSL626|5.0|My son cannot put the game down once he gets started playing!  Thanks for helping him have so much fun!
B000W178XO|5.0|I may be in a younger generation where Johnny Cash isn't as relevant but I still love his music, It's truly amazing how much emotion he can put into words.
B001EN71CW|5.0|It's a shame that it ended after only one season! Fox made a huge mistake with that decision! this serie could have become epic!<br />the serie is different from series like star wars, star trek or star gate ^^ ... it starts with a normal cargo ship with no mission but to bring their next job savely to their destination.<br /><br />Nevertheless i recommend this to all sci-fi fans,
1471310388|5.0|I read a review from someone who obviously loves &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; as much as I do.  I have never listened to the unabridged version and I love it.  It will be on my &#34;must listen to&#34; list every Christmas.  Tom Baker does a fine narration of this classic.  If you like the story, you'll love this audio version.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Probably the best book I have read. It kept me on my toes and made me fall in love with both of the characters!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|What is there to say other than Taylor Swift makes great music!  This CD has a variety of different songs...her other CD's tend to have the same style songs.  I don't think she could make a bad CD!!  Buy it!
B003XYE7R2|5.0|Sherlock Holmes books are not fast paced, they are detailed and fascinating. No gore required to keep you reading on. A most enjoyable curl up on the couch book.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|Una entretenida película, mezcla de terror y humor, la hace ser vista y disfrutarla con toda la familia, grandes y pequeños sin problemas.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I love incubus and this was a great cd for a great price. I would highly recommend to any incubus fan.
B00845MRKE|5.0|Good, very good!<br />Excellent film, a science fiction classic.<br />A good soundtrack. To see it again and again.<br />100% recommended,
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Needs better podcast support. I can't &#34;favorite&#34; a podcast and have a selection of the few i want to listen to regularly always there. Radio wise - it is a good app.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Una película de ciencia ficción, con gran despliegue de tecnología en la filmación.<br />Más los minutos adicionales, mejor aún.<br />Recomendada.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Takes up a lot of my spare time.  It is a very addictive game and keeps you trying to finish each level.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Disney Makes Wonderful Animated Entertainment. the Art Work is Superb and the Music is unsurpassed and the story is eternal. One cannot make a classic movie without all three of these elements!
B003XVYLDU|3.0|This is the first Kurt Vonnegut book that I have ever read.  I was intrigued as it is considered a classic science fiction book so I thought I would give it a try.  Vonnegut is clearly a talented writer.  The book explored some interesting themes such as free will vs. destiny.  It was told in an unstructured way which left me wondering if there was a reason behind it being told the way it was.  I also wondered if there was some grand revelation at the end of the story that would explain the popularity of the book.  I finished the book and never figured the above out.<br /><br />The book could best be classified as dark humor / sci fi, but the humor didn't appeal to me.  The book wasn't a chore to read, but I didn't find it compelling in any way.  When I finished it left me wondering what all the fuss was about.  It left me with just enough curiosity to want to sample another Vonnegut book, but I am not in a rush to do so.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am hooked on this game.  Graphics are excelent. Sound is good and not over annoying. I hope I don't wear out my touch screen anytime soon.
034580404X|5.0|I could never put any of the books down until I was through all three of them. It is a wonderful story and dream world for a woman. Waiting for more to be written
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This app has a great story line and I like how you can be the bad guy for one time. But you need to a really multiplayer because it has a good ranking system and a<br />great weapon choices to chose from.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|Like the interactive days & the pictures are really cute! =) My great-neice loved opening each door & doing the tasks.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun and quick<br /> Good sound effects and fast moving game. I normally don't play this type of game but have enjoyed it very much.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I waited five long years for Zepp to release this, and I wasn't disappointed with the final product. The only other thing I would have liked would have been more behind the scenes footage, or an interview disk, but these are minor complaints. There isn't anything I could add that hasn't already been mentioned in previous reviews.<br /><br />Just buy yourself a copy already.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Good game to pass the time. My only problem with it is how much energy required to play for more than a few minutes and how expensive the extras are.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This film was just an Ok action film, not much different than any other in that genre. Nice chase scenes but nothing new.
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|And it's red. My favorite color. Can't go wrong at all. And I need a few more words so i can publish this review...
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|the last album was so good I should have expected this one would be not be quite as good.  It is fine though.
B008OOYALE|2.0|It's a little fun but gets boring after awhile . It also always turns to a blue screen and that gets very annoying
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|On my new kindle fire vs the tilt function is completely backwards. It will turn upside down every time so I cut really play this game. Please fix / update.
B004X60QE2|5.0|I wanted a copy of season one, to me this is the best of all of the other seasons.  I can watch it over and over
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Well, I love Johnny Depp an Vampire flicks, so I thought I would love this. It was just okay. There were a few parts that made me laugh, I watched the whole movie, but I won't be rushing to watch this again. Even though it was PG-13 I thought it pushed those lines a bit, there were some awkward moments as I watched ths with my daughters.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I sall TED in theaters the second day of release and loved every minute of it, so much so I wanted to see it again when it came out for blu-ray and or digital rental.  The trailers funny parts are just the tip of the iceberg, there lots more in the movie, if you haven't seen this yet, your definitely missing out on one of the most original movies in years. You will not be disappointed.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I absolutely love this app as I can browse Google+, +1, comment on posts and make my own posts to G+. The only thing that seems to be lacking in the G+ portion of the app is the ability to mention someone in the comments. This app is great for all types of things but as you can tell from my review I mainly use it for G+ and I'm still in the process of playing around with it for news and other social media sites.<br /><br />The actual flipping as you turn the pages and the layout is great. I have recommended it to other Kindle Fire HD owners and they seem to enjoy it quite a bit too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These are such good books. I have read them over and over. These are not for everyone. If you like erotica, then u will like these.
0399226907|4.0|Very cute, bright and colorful book. My daughter loves this book, though it's maller than expected. Note product dimensions: 7 x 0.7 x 5 inches
B00A861QMM|1.0|this game is not for me my son doesnt like it at all the graphics sucks and the game is very very slow
B00A12VJZM|5.0|I love the stones.  This covers a wide variety of all their music.  I have to write seven more words.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Reminds us of Gran Torino.....but can't help but love Clint!  Blah, blah, blah.....I wish there weren't a minimum word requirement :-/
B004EK926K|5.0|Disney took a Christmas Classic and made it better than ever,loved it. CHarles Dickens would be proud of Disney's accomplishment of his Victorian era Tale.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I haven't had it very long but so far it seems pretty good.  Would like to review in about 6 months from now to be more accurate.
B008CPAYVK|2.0|I must say not one Jennifer Anistons best and I consider Myself a great fan.The Teaser Trailer was much Funnier than the movie as a whole..
B004FRX0MY|5.0|A great product, I love it. If you haven't tried it you have no idea what you are missing. An amazing app.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Clean, not much bad language. Not alot of sexual scenes or nudity.  Something my husband and I can watch enjoyably.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Without access to Showtime, this provided a great opportunity to see this Emmy decorated program.  I have Uverse internet and was able to view in the highest resolution with no stops or other video problems.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|Betty Eadie's story resonates within at soul level, providing the reminders needed to live the lives we planned before our birth.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I ordered this product because I thought my charger no longer worked. It had gotten a little bent somehow but I found out my Kindle was defective. I have received a new one & this new charger is great to have as a spare!!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I loved these movies they're so good. Although I do wish it had special features but whatever, if you really want to see them they're probably on youtube.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play this every day a little bit I love servh n find games but I don't like having to have crystals to get things
0525953728|1.0|I would actually love to burn this book, but I don't believe in book burning!  Read at your own peril!  The writing is much like a poorly educated teenager writing a paper for high school.  Guns, shooting, etc. take precedence over any intelligent decision making.  Extremely politically motivated!  Scary to think this is what we create in the US!  So disrepectful and racist!
B007VGXS8M|1.0|It didn't work it just froze up plus picture was to small n wouldn't enlarge and the list didn't like to pop up when needed
B0053TMP24|5.0|This was a great book, looking forward to the mark of Athena. Loved the battle scenes and all of the giants.
B0089XH38M|5.0|It has warned me about 2 apps already. I have this app on my tablet and phone. So glad it's free.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I saw this movie at the theatre and was impressed about how the adventure to see the Guardians brought the young group of owls through a rough patch and grew, while learning about some of the good and bad things in life.  Belief in stories told by their parents brought them to the Guardians, who were able to help them re-correct the bad that had come in their lifes.  Excellent movie.  I had to have the DVD to enjoy again.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This games was so fun to play for about 15 minutes then you're stuck unless you buy the full version. The graphics are better than most games of this type. I may buy the full app soon.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Enjoyable, but pretty much a typical Stephen King story. Think could be so much better with a longer story, thought it was a great premise and think so much more could be done. Not. complaining, thought it was great short story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The name of this book should be \\"Breathless\\" because that's how it felt the entire time I was reading. I bought this book last night based off all of the great reviews, and was not disappointed. I started reading this morning and could not put it down(dishes and laundry be damned). I don't believe that I have ever been this emotionally struck by a book before. Colleen Hoover has such a beautiful way of making you feel everything her characters are feeling, it is like you are there experiencing every moment with them(the good, the bad, the beautiful). I loved how strong Sky was at all the right times, but she was also weak when she should have been. And Holder OMG, every girl wants a guy just like him; strong, supportive, caring and amazingly attractive. I had such a great time trying to figure out how this book was going to turn out and at every turn I was surprised. Read this book, you won't regret it.
B00ARAO720|3.0|Goes to the villian.  He reminded me of the bad guys in the kids shows I used to watch.  Over-actors anonymous should be his next stop.  Worth the rental though.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|case came with scratches in it, didn't come up to the standards i was hoping and expecting it to be
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I've used many Nikon speedlights and this is certainly one of my favorites. The interface is very user friendly (especially if you have a basic knowledge of other flashes or speedlights).  The lighting is even and consistent.<br /><br />The only con I've established so far has been that the flash doesn't get along with rechargeable AA batteries because they aren't powerful enough. You'll either need to by some top of the line rechargeable batteries or stick with AA lithiums. AA lithium batteries do last quite a while especially when you turn the power down to 1/2 or 1/4.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I bought this for my son who is in his forties. He loves americam horror stories.This is the first edition
B003UESJF6|5.0|We have watched this movie over and over.  Still not sick of it.  Great movie to add to a collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm always trying to outdo myself -- and my nephew. It's challenging at first. It'd be great if there was an option to replay the tutorial.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|As typed by my son: many cool things and boss battles. also, many cool birds. kept me entertained for hours
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|This movie was slow and boring.  The plot was not fully developed.  Even if it was it wouldn't have made a very good movie.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|As dictated by my son: You have to make vehicles to collect map pieces and boxes with stars.  Try to get the pigs to their destination or collect all the boxes.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is a lot like 50 Shades but with a twist. It does not have kinky sex. I enjoyed the book.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|This game reminds me of a combination of Lemmings and an old Vic-20 game that everyone has forgotten about by now, called Radar Rat Race. Both games came out well over a decade before the Dreamcast, so I wouldn't call this &quot;original&quot;. As for the game itself, it seems OK but isn't really my cup of tea.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Don't watch this one alone. You need your whole family with you for this one. It is a great true story of who we can work together to accomplish something great. Priceless.
B009X010RU|4.0|This Marware case provides basic protection for screen and body of the 8.9&#34; Kindle and does not add significant weight while holding the Kindle 8.9.  The flip over cover is a little flimsy when use as a stand for the tablet and thus must sit on a firm surface to work well.  It would have been nice to have two stand positions (rather than just one). Overall very satisfied with the product.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This entertaining movie is worth watch if you like sci-fy, horror, thrillers, vampire type movies. The action is great and the special effects are cool.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I was unable to download this product to my Coby Kyros Model MID7042 so I really can't rate this product. If I can ever download it to my tablet I would be glad to review it.<br /><br />I was able to download Rail Maze with no problems.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I don't like to purchase movies, but this one is worth watching multiple times, so that say a lot. I like the actors and characters.  A true adventure.
B0081SPK0I|2.0|I was unable to download this product to my Coby Kyros Model MID7042 so I really can't rate this product.  If I can ever download it to my tablet I would be glad to review it.<br /><br />I was able to download Rail Maze with no problems.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Great story line, good acting, and worth watching. I enjoyed watching this new version of the classic story, but not suitable for children.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|You know, I really can't believe so many people are complaining about Oprah narrating the US release of this series.  Just for the record, I'm not going to go so far as to say that I do not like her, but I am not a fan.<br /><br />However, when I first watched this series as it came to television, I ENJOYED how she narrated it.  She does not make anyone feel stupid or childish.  If some of you feel that way, that is your problem.  I am not stupid, have never felt stupid, and in no way, shape, or form, ever felt as if Oprah was talking down to me.  If you do have these types of problems, and if for some \\"strange reason,\\" other people just insult you out of the blue more so than others, then I guess you may need to buy the other version and spend more money.<br /><br />I mean come on, what in the he** is she supposed to do, accentuate as if she is selling an action packed fairy tale to children before they fall asleep at night?  Bull!<br /><br />Buy it if you don't have self-esteem, or personal Oprah problems, and you will love it!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|This interesting version of the classic space exploration movie show the dark prequel to the original Aliens movie. Worth renting, but it has it's flaws.
B004YHRZLM|5.0|Beautifully remastered and a children's classic! Got it for myself and enjoyed the movie so much! Great DVD packaging and came with a Blu ray disc
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Total Recall is an excellent remake of the original movie. Great special effects, Good Story, and the movie is fast paced. Definitely worth renting. The character are good, the actors and actress play their parts well.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|hysterical.  very entertaining.  guys will love mila and girls will love mark and everyone will love ted!!!!!!!!!  enjoy this flick.  our family watched it for christmas!!!
1400052181|5.0|If you are interested in the treatment of cancer and the history of how the study and experimentation of treatment started making progress, this book is a must read. It is a fascinating true story of a woman's contribution to medical science. Henrietta Lacks has become one of my most admired heroes. We should all know more about her.
B000VT7AUS|4.0|Very easy to listen to, she has a great voice and a forerunner for a lot of the great female artists around now
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|I think that this series of movies is played out already. All the fighting done is very robotic and predictable... If you're looking to spend a few bucks for some background noise, then it isn't bad, but the story is uninteresting and the action is stale.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Wonderful, Wonderful movie! The color is vibrant! And, the story is special and can't wait for Disney to make another Tinker Bell.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|This was a gift but I will also get to enjoy it as well.  I enjoyed the movie and especially the soundtrack.  No glitter....
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We went to the theater to see this, rented it at least a half dozen times from various places and had to two purchase two copies one for a little one and one for a teen! Outstanding movie!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I'm a 37 year-old, and I feel like a kid at an arcade every time I &quot;launch&quot; this app -- but no quarters required... Well done!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Every year we watch this as a family and it never gets old.  It is a classic Christmas movie.  My son repeats lines from the movie all year long.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game for a family game night! My family spent almost two hours playing one round of this game and my dad got so into it he stopped watching the football game that was on (and he loves his sports). It is the perfect combination of both strategy and luck. One of the great things about this game is that even when it is not your turn you are still involved so you are kept interested the whole time. It is also a great social game that you can talk through while you are playing (there was lots of laughing, shouting, and shaking fists at other players). Believe me I love a good hard core strategy game where you barely talk because you are concentrating so hard on your next move but sometimes it is refreshing to just relax and see what number the dice rolls.
B001J53X9U|5.0|I love the Batpod and this is nice, simple model of it. The movie is excellent - we all know that - so I won't comment further. The model is nice - not too big and not too small and this item is still available even in late 2012 - if you are a Batman fan - pick one up - you won't regret it.
1419705849|5.0|Absolutely love this series of books. Keeps our child reading. It's a shame that the next book is so far off.
B009VB97EY|5.0|great movie, I plan on watching it again today.Channing is hot, so are the other guys. I really wanted to see more of<br />Matthew.So I am going to watch it now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After reading this book I've finally discovered what all the hype is about. This book is captivating and enthralling. I absolutely love it.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It's fun even though I am a terrible artist.  It is fun to play with adults or with my kids.
B002LF2T4C|5.0|Been a fan of this movie for years! Johnny Depp is a trip and plays his role perfectly and there are so many great actors in this movie.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting reading. However, it's a little short regarding the NDE portions. The author was very specific regarding the cause and effect of the illness he contracted, but the NDE portion of this small book probably, maybe, filled one chapter
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Great movie. A comedy with a great mix of adult humor and good vibes. We would definitely watch it again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|We like the variety of games and accumulation of points across the games.  My eight year old is a big fan.
B009FZFONO|5.0|We've been a fan of this show since it first aired and we're always eagerly waiting for the next episode.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|From the build quality i don't expect this will last long but for now it works for what I need.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|We've been a fan of this show since it first aired. Season 2 is even more wild than the first!
0375413405|5.0|I was really struggling to find my new fiancé Christmas gifts for our first holidays together and was so happy to have found this! Her mom has the two book set but this one is unabridged and in one copy that is easy to store and use.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|The ongoing storyline is great. You can come and go as you please. Saves at each chapter and can skip dialog if you read before and are coming back to start the search (yes that progress is not saved but you don't lose the chapter and if you really love these games then this is NOT a concern). ENJOY :)
B007SGM084|4.0|I kept wondering why I felt the need to finish, where was the plot and young girls can be stupid
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wish ads would not pop up everytime you start game, otherwise it is OK. Ok Ok Ok Ok Ok Ok.
B00A757EFW|5.0|great I love the game It reminded me of the older days, when I was younger. I love pac man
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I chose 4 stars well... my favorite one of all was the 6th book. This might be my 3rd or 4th. It's good but I really didn't hear much about Roderick, the Mom,the Dad, mostly Many. I love it with the uncle and all the advice to Greg. :) Ps moms, (I'm 10) I would not like to have a mom like that! All the you'll ruin the coat things and inbaresment of taking of the coat thing  and Waring your moms big coat. :l WOW  :) & :P<br />  MCKAYLA :O
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|she can sing and I and feeling the sons. I am not a country person but It doesn't sound like country it sounds like r&b real lives, and real situations..
B0067Q42BY|4.0|A challenging version of mahjong. I would recommend this for people that enjoy the classic mahjong and puzzle-games in general.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was  awesome. Most definitely recommend. The perks of being a wallflower met every expectation that I had built up in my mind.
B001684L0A|5.0|I love history, and this miniseries is outstanding on all levels.<br />Paul Giamatti is awesome, but so is everyone in the cast.<br />We tend to forget the sacrifices our Founding Fathers and their<br />families made to establish this great country.  This miniseries<br />reminds us that it was tough minded people working without a net!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this series for my wife upon the recommendation of my daughter.  We watched several episodes per evening and find ourselves awaiting the start of the 3rd season.  Very addictive.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My daughter wanted lego sets like her big brother, and she was thrilled to see this cute girlie tree house set.  She built it with help from brother and loves playing with it.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This was probably one of the funniest if not the funniest movie ever made. The bear was awesome and the family guy cast added to what we already knew was going to be a funny movie
B004478GNI|5.0|My son wanted this for Christmas, and he was very happy when he unwrapped it.  It was his favorite present, and he put it together after an evening and morning working on it.  Highly recommended for Lego and/or Star Wars fans.
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|Definitely puts my sisters and me in the spirit and sometimes I run to a few of the songs during the year.
B008602KQI|5.0|My granddaughter was all about Hunger Games for Christmas, pillow case cover, blanket, video,etc.She loves the movie, & Amazon.com.Thank You, Happy New Year!!!!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas Gift for my nephew who is a Nolan Fan. His feedback of the Blue Ray effects, extra footage, and booklet had him blown away. Even if you are not a fan of his or Batman you will enjoy this product. A must have!! I bought one for myself as well and Im glad I did. Now Im a fan too and looking forward to see more of his movies and this type of collector's item not only from this brilliant producer and director, but from others in his caliber as well.  Thanks Amazon my nephew still thanking me.  I made his Christmas.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just thought it was a good read.  Like the fact that they fell in love & actually go married.  Now hopefully the next book is just as good.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I have Ray Kurzweil to thank for this app. he mentioned it in his book How To Create A Mind. I installed it on my Iphone and Kindle. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs to solve a math problem quickly without using a white board.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As a long time John Grishm fan, I have come to expect a certain level of enjoyment from his books. This one did not leave me wanting. It was lots of fun to read, are there better John Grishm books, yes. But it was still enjoyable.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|If you love Bob you must see this movie, it's kick butt! I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. I love it too.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love playing this game. Some of them are pretty hard, but I do spend hours trying to get more stars...fun
B0027MJU00|5.0|It took me 3 days to read this book, it was suspenseful and constantly interesting. the writers style is fun and well organized. All in all a great read.
B000RHFTGG|2.0|I am loathe to leave negative or neutral feedback. In these times, we all need all the help we can get.<br /><br />But I also need to be honest. And for $61.00 I just bought an album that was listed as Like New which is in mediorcre condition at best. Caveat emptor, my bad. But as anyone, I have come to trust the listings on Amazon as a true reflection of the items I purchase. And it largely has been. Not this time.<br /><br />A low or neutral rating is an indication to other shoppers that this seller either mislead me or doesn't know what they are doing. I am a collector of albums. I got a raw deal. This is my attempt at ensuring others don't as well.<br /><br />After I left a (generous) three star rating, this seller e-mailed me asking me to reconsider. No. From now on, rate your items correctly and honestly. Sixty bucks is a lot for a perfect copy of this record. It's a REAL lot for a banged up copy.<br /><br />Don't avoid this seller, but be sure to research.<br /><br />Thank you.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me really think about life in a different perspective. I thought about feeling infinite, and how much I want a friend like Charlie :) I guess the only thing I didn't really like was the inappropriate level. So I would recommend it to teenagers from 14 and up.
B000W745CU|5.0|It's a great movie to see, especially as the end of the series is drawing to an end.  Loved seeing it in theatre, but even more when I'm at home and can watch it over & over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|heard its great looking toward to it. Practiced with my God sister trying to beat her score omg getting. used to it going crazy
B001UV4XIS|5.0|It's a great movie to see, especially as the end of the series is drawing to an end.  Loved seeing it in theatre, but even more when I'm at home and can watch it over & over.
B000007XUQ|5.0|A lifelong fan of the Carpenters this Christmas Collection is just what I'd hoped it would be.  Everything about this product is perfect !!!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|It's a great movie to see, especially as the end of the series is drawing to an end.  Loved seeing it in theatre, but even more when I'm at home and can watch it over & over.
0767020308|5.0|I've always loved the story and really do prefer Kate Beckinsale in the title role.  Picture and sound quality are excellent.
0060254920|5.0|I got this for my new little nephew. I couldn't think of a better gift to get kids out of technology.
